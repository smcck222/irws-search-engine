  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 11 KYODO -- The Economic Planning 
Agency (EPA) will do its utmost to formulate a new set of 
pump-priming measures by mid-January, the agency chief said 
Tuesday [11 January]. 
  The ruling coalition parties are working hard to iron out 
their difference on whether to hike the consumption tax to 
finance an income tax cut, EPA Director General Manae Kubota 
told a regular press conference. 
  When a consensus is reached on this "thorny issue," Kubota 
said, the ruling coalition parties will coordinate their view 
with the government at a joint economic forum. 
  The Social Democratic Party [of Japan], the largest in the 
seven-party coalition, has been strongly opposed to hiking the 
consumption tax.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 11 KYODO -- Japan is to focus its 
fiscal 1994 tax reforms on unfair levy systems in a bid to win 
public support on a consumption tax hike, government sources 
said Tuesday [11 January]. 
  The government will consider such reforms as lowering the 
tax 
exemption ceiling for corporate entertainment expenses, raising 
levy rates on profit-making operations at nonprofit 
organizations and gradually abolishing the special treatment of 
medical institutions and seven designated businesses such as 
mass communications, the sources said. 
  They said an adoption of punitive heavy taxes is also on the 
discussion table for unexplained corporate expenditures that are 
widely suspected of being used in dubious political donations 
and bribes. 
  The move is apparently intended to pave the way for raising 
the consumption tax rate, currently at 3 percent, in line with 
hearings at six major cities conducted by the Tax Commission, an 
advisory panel to the prime minister, in November. 
  Panel members had said the majority opinions at the hearings 
were for rectifying unfair tax systems before the tax hike. 
  The hearings were to gather regional opinions on the panel's 
tax reform report that calls for an income tax cut and a 
consumption tax hike in a single program. 
  A Finance Ministry official said, "a huge increase in tax 
revenues can't be expected" with the reforms on unfair tax 
systems. 
  The ministry is strongly insisting that an income tax cut 
must be financed by a consumption tax hike, thus conflicting 
with socialists and some other parties within the ruling 
coalition that are against the tax hike. 
  This dispute is preventing discussions on including the 
income tax breaks in the government's fresh economic stimulus 
package to be launched around January 20. 
  Meanwhile, the tax panel will resume its talks on fiscal 
1994 
tax reform on Friday, apparently with settlements looking set 
for Diet deliberations on political reforms -- Hosokawa's top 
policy priority. 
  The panel suspended its meetings in mid-December to watch 
the 
development in political reforms. 
  On the entertainment expenses, the government wants to lower 
the exemption amount to check those companies evading corporate 
taxes through huge write-offs of such expenses to artificially 
fall into the red, the sources said. 
  Currently, entertainment expenses at companies capitalized 
at 
50 million yen and more are levied fully. But 4 million yen is 
allowed for nontax write-offs as losses for companies 
capitalized up to 10 million yen, and 3 million yen for 
companies between 50 million and 10 million yen. 
  Some government leaders have been calling for the reform in 
those expenses in or after fiscal 1995, to avoid undermining 
corporate activities amid the current economic slump. 
  But the Finance Ministry has been strongly insisting on an 
early overhaul. 
  The sources said the government intends to raise the special 
levy rate, currently at 27 percent, on profit-making operations 
at religious, educational and other nonprofit organizations by 1 
percentage point to 28 percent, the same specially treated rate 
on medium-size to small businesses. 
  Clarification of nontax and tax operations will also be 
considered, the sources said. Currently, for example, donations 
and charms are tax-exempt for religious organizations, but 
postcards and parking tolls are subject to taxation. 
  A staged abolishment is planned for nontax treatments on 
social security rewards to medical practitioners and lower-tax 
treatments on mass communications, publications and five other 
specially designated businesses. 
  Considering unexplained expenses, recently uncovered bribery 
scandals underlined practices by Japanese companies using such 
expenses in political maneuvering. 
  The government is eyeing a punitive heavy levy as one of the 
options to stop such practices, but concerns exist over 
companies taking it as an excuse to write off an unlimited 
amount of unspecified expenses as long as they pay the heavy tax. 
  The sources said a final decision on the dubious expenses 
will be left to the government and the ruling coalition parties 
to decide.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 11 KYODO -- Labor Minister Chikara 
Sakaguchi said Tuesday [11 January] that he was unhappy about 
the action of a major machine tool company in lowering its 
mandatory retirement age from 60 to 56. 
  Sakaguchi said the move by Okuma Corp. runs counter to the 
law governing employment of senior workers that requires 
employers to make efforts to set the retirement age at 60. 
  "We as the labor ministry will give instructions," Sakaguchi 
told reporters at a press conference. 
  Okuma on Monday said it had lowered its retirement age for 
employees to 56 in a move designed to cut labor costs. 
  "It might not stand to reason to interfere with an agreement 
between labor and management but this is a problem with social 
implications," Sakaguchi said. 
  Many Japanese companies are trying to weather the recession 
by trimming labor costs by means of asking employees to retire 
voluntarily but Okuma is the first to slash the retirement age.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 11 KYODO -- Japan's farm minister 
recommends that imported long-grain rice for table use from 
Thailand should be retailed at half the price of domestic rice, 
ministry officials said Tuesday [11 January]. 
  Eijiro Hata, minister of agriculture, forestry and 
fisheries, 
said at a meeting of cabinet ministers that the retail price of 
rice from California should be 70 percent of the standard price 
of Japanese rice and rice from China should be sold at 60 
percent of the ordinary domestic rice price. 
  Japan is importing rice on emergency basis in the current 
fiscal year due to a bad crop in 1993. 
  In the meeting, Manae Kubota, director general of the 
Economic Planning Agency said, retail price-setting should be 
consumer-oriented and the government should advise retailers to 
show the year of production of the rice they are selling. 
  A committee meeting of the Rice Price Council will be held 
Thursday to discuss the retail prices of such imported rice. 
  Kubota called on Hata to ensure that the price for rice to 
be 
imported from next fiscal year beginning in April under the 
government's minimum access policy should be set at a council 
meeting before the government officially decides the price, 
ministry sources said. 
  Japan has decided to partially open its rice market under an 
agreement in the Uruguay round trade talks which were wrapped up 
in December.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 11 KYODO -- Defense Agency chief Kazuo 
Aichi said Tuesday [11 January] he will consult with Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to review Japan's national defense 
program outline. 
  Aichi, director general of the agency, made the remark to 
reporters after a cabinet meeting on the issue. 
  "I will consult with Prime Minister Hosokawa on arranging 
the 
reviews. We must go ahead with the work within the 
understanding of one another on the issue," he said. He 
admitted that relations between the prime minister and the 
agency on the issue were insufficient. 
  The prime minister has voiced his intention to set up his 
advisory panel to review the defense program outline and to 
reach a conclusion by around summer. 
  But some Defense Agency officials have opposed Hosokawa's 
proposal. 
  Aichi hinted at a meeting with Hosokawa in February after 
political reform bills are enacted. The bills are expected to 
pass through the Diet by the end of the current Diet session on 
January 29. 
  The cabinet of Former Prime Minister Takeo Miki drafted the 
defense plan in 1976, which outlines the need to arrange armed 
forces through numerical targets. 
  Since then the agency has drafted midterm, five-year defense 
buildup programs based on the outline. 
  Japan has considered reviewing the defense outline since the 
Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 11 KYODO -- The president of the 
pro-Seoul Organization of Koreans in Japan attended the 
convention of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) 
[SDPJ] on Tuesday [11 January] for the first time since the 1955 
birth of the Japanese party. 
  The SDPJ, the largest force in the seven-party coalition 
government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, has 
traditionally had friendly ties with North Korea. 
  Chung Hae ryong [name as received], president of the Korean 
Residents Union in Japan (Mindan), gave an address to SDP 
representatives on the first day of the two-day convention. 
  But the leader of the pro-Pyongyang General Association of 
Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyun) -- effectively a 
Tokyo-Pyongyang contact channel as North Korea and Japan have no 
diplomatic relations -- did not attend the SDPJ convention. 
  Moreover, the Workers' Party of North Korea has not sent the 
SDPJ a congratulatory telegram for the convention as it always 
had previously, SDPJ officials said. 
  The development is regarded as an expression of Pyongyang's 
disapproval of the move by the SDPJ, which has gradually shifted 
its stance toward South Korea since joining the coalition in 
August. 
  Former SDPJ Chairman Sadao Yamahana, who is currently state 
minister in charge of political reform, visited South Korea in 
September last year, the first time the head of the SDPJ has 
done so. 
  The SDPJ has also adopted a new foreign policy which 
includes 
a balanced stance toward South and North Korea.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 11 KYODO -- Greenpeace International has 
sent experts from its Amsterdam headquarters to Japan to 
coordinate contacts with local opponents of the prototype fast 
breeder reactor Monju, Greenpeace Japan officials said Tuesday 
[11 January]. 
  The officials said they want the government to call off the 
project. Japan is the only major country with a nuclear power 
generation program which has not abandoned or postponed its 
attempt to develop a fast breeder reactor. 
  The Greenpeace experts have been in contact with groups in 
Fukui Prefecture opposed to the fast breeder since their arrival 
in Japan in October. 
  The plutonium-fueled Monju, which is operated by the power 
reactor and Nuclear Fuel Corp., is on the Sea of Japan coast in 
Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture. 
  Naoki Ohara, a Greenpeace Japan executive director, said the 
organization's strength lies in its ability to gather 
information worldwide and then apply it locally. 
  "We consider (the fast breeder) to be unsafe and we want to 
halt its operation," Ohara said. 
  Fast breeder reactors use reprocessed plutonium as fuel but 
produce more plutonium than they consume. 
  Monju has the capacity to generate 280,000 kilowatts of 
electricity. Construction of a full-scale fast breeder reactor 
is also scheduled to begin around 2000. 
  The United States has halted its fast breeder program 
because 
of the low cost of uranium and as a measure against the spread 
of nuclear weapons which rely on plutonium. Britain and Germany 
have also decided to halt their programs. 
  France's super Phoenix fast breeder has been out of 
operation 
since July 1990 after a series of problems, including the 
leaking of air into the coolant. 
  But the Japanese Government plans to have Monju reach 
criticality in April, followed by about 18 months of experiments 
to confirm its operating capability, leading to full operation 
by December 1996. 
  Japan's plan to ship 30 tons of plutonium for its fast 
breeder program from Europe over the next 20 years has sparked 
concerns in countries which fear accidents or terrorist attacks.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 10 KYODO -- The ruling coalition on 
Monday [10 January] brushed aside opposition resistance and 
readied itself to take a vote on a package of four political 
reform bills at a House of Councillors plenary session on 
January 19 and enact them into law. 
  One day before the plenary session, the upper house's 
special 
committee will vote on the bills, officials said. 
  The schedule was fixed after the second chamber's special 
committee voted Monday to set the date of a public hearing on 
the bills at January 17. 
  Officials said a vote can be taken at any time if a public 
hearing is called. 
  Public hearings are mandatory for budgets and revenue bills 
to become law. Hearings are necessary for other bills which 
parties consider important. 
  The ruling and opposition parties have agreed to require 
public hearings for the passage of the political reform bills, 
which call for introducing single-seat constituencies combined 
with proportional representation for House of Representatives 
general elections and imposing stricter controls on political 
funding. 
  The bills cleared the lower house in mid-November. 
  At Monday's session of the special committee, a ruling 
legislator entered a motion to set the date for the public 
hearing. 
  Committee Chairman Shoji Motooka called a vote, drawing 
angry 
protests from members of two opposition parties, the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] and the Japanese Communist Party [JCP] 
legislators. 
  Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic 
Party 
(SDP), the biggest party in the seven-party coalition, told a 
meeting of coalition leaders Monday, "we should not accept any 
proposals to put off the final vote until after January 19." 
  Upper house deliberations on political reform bills have 
stalled by opposition resistance. 
  Coalition leaders also decided not to bargain with the LDP 
over possible modifications unless it pledges to cooperate with 
the coalition in enacting the bills by the deadline of January 
29, the sources said. 
  Meanwhile, Man Sasaki, chairman of the LDP's Diet Affairs 
Committee, threatened to table a no-confidence motion against 
Motooka for calling the vote on the public hearing without the 
consent of the opposition camp. 
  "It is an unprecedented parliamentary tactic to call a vote 
at the very moment the ruling coalition and opposition are still 
consulting on the upcoming parliamentary agenda," Sasaki said. 
  The government-proposed electoral bill calls for replacing 
the current 511-seat lower chamber with a 500-seat mixture of 
274 single-seat constituencies and 226 proportional 
representation seats. 
  The LDP has been demanding that the number of single-seat 
constituencies be increased from the proposed 274. It has also 
urged the coalition to ease curbs on a proposed ban on donations 
from business corporations to individual politicians. 
  Political analysts said the ruling coalition fears the 
package of four bills might be killed at a final vote, if more 
than a dozen SDP legislators voted against them, along with 
legislators of the Niin Club, a five-member parliamentary group 
in the upper house. 
  The LDP, JCP, and Niin Club has a combined parliamentary 
strength of 114 in the upper house, while the ruling coalition 
has 131. There are also six independents.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 11 KYODO -- The head of the Social 
Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] on Tuesday [11 January] 
renewed a pledge that the party will stay in the coalition 
government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and enact 
political reform bills in the current Diet session. 
  Party Chairman Tomiichi Murayama made the remarks at a 
two-day party convention which started Tuesday. Hosokawa also 
addressed the convention as a guest. 
  Hosokawa told the delegates that enacting political reform 
bills in the current parliament session is a mission of the 
ruling coalition. 
  SDPJ sources said there is a strong dissatisfaction among 
party members with the party leadership, which is regarded as 
having compromised too much on crucial issues such as political 
reform and the partial lifting of the rice market. 
  The 60th party convention, a continuation of a meeting held 
on September 25 last year, is scheduled to adopt an action 
program for this year advocating political reform. 
  Some 400 delegates made up of SDPJ Diet members and local 
representatives from the country's 47 prefectures have 
registered to attend the meeting, party officials said. 
  At the opening of the convention, Murayama said, "political 
reform bills aimed at stemming graft-ridden politics should be 
legislated during the current Diet session at any cost." 
  The government-proposed political reform bills are currently 
in the House of Councillors for further deliberation after being 
passed by the more powerful House of Representatives in November 
last year. 
  The bills call for replacing the multiseat electoral system 
for the lower house, which encourages lavish campaign spending, 
with a system combining single-seat constituencies and 
proportional representation, as well as tightening curbs on 
political fund-raising activities. 
  Murayama reiterated the party stance to continue in the 
seven-party coalition government, saying, "if the SDPJ does not 
remain in the coalition, politics might be dominated by 
conservative forces." 
  "An axis gathering broad-based liberal forces has to be 
formed as early as possible to square off with strong 
conservative groups," he said. The SDPJ is the biggest party in 
the coalition. 
  On the dissolution of the lower house, Murayama said, 
"general elections which causes a two-month void in politics 
should not be held in the current harsh economic climate, but 
(I) cannot definitely say what kind of decision Hosokawa will 
make in the wake of political upheaval." 
  Last month, Hosokawa gave up his initial target to get the 
political reform bills into law by the end of 1993 and set a new 
deadline of January 29, when the extended extraordinary Diet 
session ends. 
  If the bills are not passed by then, there is a possibility 
that the government would resign or dissolve the lower house for 
an election, political commentators said. 
  Murayama said the SDPJ has to win more than 100 seats in the 
next general election. 
  In the last lower house general election held in July last 
year, the SDPJ suffered a historical setback, seeing its 
strength almost halved from 134 before the polls. 
  The election, however, dislodged the Liberal Democratic 
Party 
(LDP) from a 38-year-old grip on power, bringing about the 
coalition government.

  [Text] The Philippines will not neglect its relations with 
European countries despite its perceived close relations with 
United States and Japan, Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto 
Romulo yesterday assured visiting British Finance Minister 
Kenneth Clarke. I want to assure you that although we continue 
to be very positive on the results of the Seattle meeting and 
the future of APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation], we 
certainly do not want it to be a way of discouraging others, 
particularly European Union from coming here seeking mutual 
gains from both sides, quote unquote, Romulo told reporters. 
  He said that during his meeting with Clarke, he was told 
that 
many Europeans perceived the Philippines as, quote unquote, too 
oriented towards the United States and Japan. Romulo noted that 
since the November Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders' 
summit in Seattle, Clarke's visit to the Philippines is the 
first manifestation of interest in Asia by several officials 
from the European Union. During the APEC summit, the European 
Union, formerly known as the European Community, had expressed 
alarm that it is still isolated from the Asia Pacific 
conference. Clarke told Romulo that as a result of the APEC 
meeting, it was assumed that the European Union believed that 
this might be misunderstood as though they were just giving up 
this part of the globe, quote unquote. But contrary to the 
common perception, European nations are interested to expand 
economic relations with Asia, Clarke said. 
  Europe needs to do a lot of work to tackle the business. 
Clarke was particularly positive in his desire to focus on the 
Philippines and also the Asian region because clearly his 
presence here for some five days together with some prominent 
businessmen is a good sign.

  [Text] The Thai government and military yesterday 
reaffirmed Thailand's full support for the elected Cambodian 
government, and strongly denied a new wave of allegations that 
Bangkok still secretly backs the Khmer Rouge. 
  "Why do some people in Cambodia always blame it all on 
Thailand every time they are defeated on the battlefield by the 
Khmer Rouge?" army spokesman Col Phalangkun Klahan said at a 
press conference. He also criticized western news agencies for 
what he described as reports biased against Thailand. 
  Fresh accusations concerning the Khmer Rouge were 
threatening 
to sour Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's planned visit to Cambodia 
tomorrow. 
  On Saturday Cambodian Foreign Minister Prince Norodom 
Sirivut 
demanded that Chuan clarify Thailand's stand during his visit. 
The following day Cambodian commanders and UN officials 
reportedly alleged that the Khmer Rouge launched recent attacks 
from inside Thailand. 
  "The Khmer Rouge being pinned against the ropes is one 
thing, 
and attacking from Thailand is another," said Phalangkun. 
  "The Thai army commander in chief has made it clear that the 
Thai military is strictly complying with the govemment's policy 
of supporting only the legitimate government of Cambodia." 
  Thailand has never complained internationally about 
artillery 
shells landing on Thai soil as a result of fighting between 
Cambodian troops and the Khmer Rouge, added the army spokesman. 
  "Since last December, nearly 100 shells caused damage along 
the Thai border. Who should be responsible for that? Can Prince 
Norodom Sirivut answer that?" 
  He said the army has invited foreign journalists from two 
western news agencies to attend a briefing on Thai policy toward 
Cambodia. 
  Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said the government has 
recognized and supported the legitimate Cambodian government 
since the 1991 Paris accords were signed. 
  Cambodian officials should be more careful when giving 
interviews to foreign journalists, because their reports could 
indirectly affect the promising relations between the two 
countries. 
  Prasong said the government wants reconciliation in Cambodia 
and he was distressed by allegations by Prince Norodom Sirivut's 
demand -- in comments to made to foreign reporters -- that Chuan 
again clarify his position. 
  "If Cambodia cannot settle its internal affairs and bring 
about unity, its chances for accelerated development are not 
good. 
  "The Cambodian government's failure to wipe out the Khmer 
Rouge rebels has nothing to do with Thailand's involvement. 
Cambodia should not try to put the blame on its neighbour," the 
foreign minister said. 
  Prasong said Cambodian military leaders should not claim 
that 
Khmer Rouge guerrillas have launched attacks from Thai soil. He 
said people from both countries sometimes travel across the 
border without being properly checked by immigration officials. 
  "It's too easy to say that Khmer Rouge forces have been 
using 
Thai soil as a military base. The military would not allow such 
activity in Thai territory. The Cambodian government should 
back its claims with substantive evidence," he said. 
  "Relationships between the two countries will be on the 
agenda during Prime Minister Chuan's visit to Cambodia beginning 
tomorrow." 
  First Army Region commander Lt Gen Chettha Thanacharo said 
the Foreign Ministry and military have always supported the 
elected Cambodian government. 
  He said Cambodia should not rely on foreign press reports, 
which sometimes give the wrong impression that Thailand 
supported the Khmer Rouge. 
  "The two countries do not have any serious disagreement. I 
think we understand each other very well," Chettha said. 
  The military is in control along the border and will 
continue 
efforts to curb weapons smuggling. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan said Cambodian 
leaders should not doubt Thailand's support. 
  "Thai assistance to the Khmer Rouge was a thing of the past 
and not applicable to present political circumstances," he said. 
  He also said economic cooperation will be a top priority at 
talks during Chuan's visit.

  [Text] Speaking to newsmen this morning at Government 
House on the strong reply of the Thai armed forces to Cambodian 
allegations on Thai support for the Khmer Rouge, Foreign 
Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri said the reply will not 
cause Thai-Cambodian relations to deteriorate. This is because 
the clarification by the armed forces was straightforward for 
the purpose of achieving nutual understanding. The two 
countries will have to work together to solve their border 
problems. 
  Regarding the criticism by the Cambodian finance minister 
that Thai businessmen are not honest, the foreign minister said 
some businessmen, regardless of their nationalities, are not 
good. Thai businessmen were the first lot to risk their 
investment in Cambodia. Therefore, they should be viewed in a 
broad-minded manner.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Prime Minister's Visit to Cambodia"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai will lead a 
delegation visiting Cambodia from 12 to 14 January. He will be 
accompanied by a group of businessmen from the private sector. 
[passage omitted] There is a political element to this visit. 
It concerns Thai-Cambodian relations as they relate to the 
Khmer Rouge issue. 
  There are trade and political issues that the prime 
ministers 
of both countries will have to thrash out and settle on good 
terms, in the spirit of compromise, and based on the principle 
of mutual interests. If each party merely tries to preserve its 
interests to the fullest, without thinking about good relations, 
problems between the two countries could blow up into a major 
conflict. Naturally, the Thai Government will try to protect 
the interests of businessmen investing in Cambodia, while the 
Cambodian Government has a duty to protect the interests of its 
people against exploitation by foreigners investing in Cambodia. 
This is why there will be a review of old contracts signed by 
the Cambodian Government. [passage omitted] 
  The Thai Government must make clear its sincere intention to 
help Cambodia in national development, especially economic and 
agricultural development. Thailand has enough potential to help 
Cambodia. We have people with expertise in agriculture, 
fishing, banking, investment, and industry. The Thai Government 
must make clear its sincerity in helping the Cambodian people 
develop their country. It must seek the Thai private sector's 
cooperation in not exploiting or taking advantage of the 
Cambodian people, as was the case with the chit fund that 
cheated the Cambodian people. 
  Anyway, a big problem between Thailand and Cambodia is the 
political issue of the Khmer Rouge. Although it is an internal 
Cambodian affair, the problem affects Thailand. On this issue, 
the prime minister should confirm to the Cambodian Government 
that Thailand no longer supports or recognizes the Khmer Rouge, 
because Cambodia now has an elected government that is 
recognized internationally. The situation has changed 
completely; the previous status of the four Cambodian factions 
has expired. Ever since the elections and the registration of 
political parties in Cambodia, the Thai Government has only 
recognized those parties that are registered under the Cambodian 
electoral system. The Khmer Rouge, therefore, is an illegal 
group.

  [Text] Phnom Penh 11 Jan (AKP) -- The prevention of 
hostile activities by the Khmer Rouge is a duty of the Royal 
Government of Cambodia [RGC], but it is also a commitment of the 
international community. This was emphasized by Sar Kheng, 
deputy prime minister and co-interior minister, at a meeting on 
Sunday, 9 January, with a U.S. congressional delegation led by 
Mr. Wilson of the Foreign Relations Commission. 
  Mr. Sar Kheng briefed his guests about the recent 
appointment 
of provincial governors, the new administrative structures 
organized in line with the principle of national reconciliation 
and unity, and the mutual understanding between major political 
parties elected to the National Assembly under the 
clear-sightedness of His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk. 
  For his part, Mr. Wilson commended the close cooperation 
between the Cambodian People's Party and the FUNCINPEC [National 
United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and 
Cooperative Cambodia] Party. The United States, he added, is 
delighted to see respect for human rights and for the Kingdom of 
Cambodia's Constitution. 
  The U.S. senator expressed his confidence that the RGC would 
be able to defend security and bring about peace for the 
Cambodian people. 
  Mr. Charles Twining, U.S. ambassador to Cambodia was also 
present at the audience.

  [Text] This morning, Samdech Chea Sim, acting head of 
state and chairman of the National Assembly, granted an audience 
to His Excellency [H.E.] Jacques Chirac, former French prime 
minister and mayor of Paris, and his colleagues at Chan Throne 
Hall in the Royal Palace. 
  Samdech Chea Sim welcomed and regarded H.E. Jacques Chirac's 
visit to Cambodia as a sign of further consolidation and 
expansion of Cambodian-French relations and cooperation that 
have existed since time immemorial. Samdech Chea Sim thanked 
the French Government for its role in helping seek peace and 
national reconciliation in Cambodia. He also thanked the Paris 
administration for assistance to the city of Phnom Penh, which 
is facing difficulties. 
  Samdech Chea Sim also informed the guests of His Majesty 
King 
Norodom Sihanouk Varaman's health, saying that his health is 
good, his medical treatment will be complete by the end of 
March, and he will return home at the beginning of April to 
attend the Cambodian traditional new year celebration with all 
Cambodian citizens. 
  H.E. Jacques Chirac stressed the cooperation and assistance 
given by the French Government and the Paris administration to 
Phnom Penh in restoring this capital of the Kingdom of Cambodia, 
which has been ruined by war in the past over two decades. 
  Through Samdech Chea Sim, H.E. Jacques Chirac wished His 
Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk Varaman a quick recovery from his 
illness so that he may return to serve his people. 
  On the same day, H.E. Chhim Siekleng, delegate of the Royal 
Government of Cambodia to Phnom Penh City, also held cordial 
talks with H.E. Jacques Chirac. 
  On that occasion, H.E. Chhim Siekleng thanked the French 
Government and Paris administration for helping to restore the 
city of Phnom Penh. He informed the guest of the difficulties 
facing Phnom Penh and asked the Paris administration to provide 
assistance in rearranging the traffic in Phnom Penh and 
construction equipment and machines for repairing the badly 
damaged roads in the capital. H.E. Chhim Siekleng also asked the 
Paris administration to provide experts for developing Phnom 
Penh and setting up a computer system for the government's 
administrative work. 
  H.E. Jacques Chirac emphasized the goodwill of the French 
Government and Paris to help Cambodia restore the city of Phnom 
Penh. In response to Phnom Penh's requests, H.E. Jacques Chirac 
promised to provide additional equipment, machines, and garbage 
trucks for use in developing and beautifying Phnom Penh. In 
this regard, France will continue helping to establish a clean 
water system and send experts to Cambodia as requested within 
the framework of the association for assistance to the 
Francophone cities.

  [Text] At 0900 on 10 January, His Excellency [H.E.] Hun 
Sen, second prime minister of Cambodia's royal national 
government, received H.E. Jacques Chirac, former French prime 
minister and mayor of Paris, and his colleagues at the office of 
the Council of Ministers. 
  On this occasion H.E. Hun Sen talked about the current 
situation in Cambodia. He asked the French Government to assist 
Cambodia in the fields of agriculture, water policy, 
communication lines linking cities and rural areas, electricity, 
and professional training. H.E. Hun Sen also suggested that 
France, cochairman of the Paris international conference on 
Cambodia, help push signatory countries to quickly implement 
their pledges to provide appropriate aid (?in accordance with) 
the territorial integrity and Cambodia's rehabilitation. 
  Concerning the Khmer Rouge issue, H.E. Hun Sen said that the 
stance of the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] remains the 
same, that is, it is always keeping the door open for the Khmer 
Rouge to join in the country's construction as government 
advisers or even member of the royal government, if a majority 
of the National Assembly agrees by amending the constitution. 
He also said that the Khmer Rouge have shown no intention of 
being reconciled with the nation and taking part in the 
rebuilding of Cambodia. On the contrary, they have intensified 
their activities in attacking the Khmer Royal Armed Forces 
[KRAF] more vigorously. H.E. Hun Sen stressed that the RGC can 
accept the Khmer Rouge only when they properly respect the three 
conditions set by His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk, namely, the 
cease-fire, the demobilization and inclusion of Khmer Rouge 
troops into the KRAF, and the handing over of the territory 
being controlled by the Khmer Rouge to the RGC. H.E. Hun Sen 
said that if the Khmer Rouge continue to fight and talk at the 
same time, the RGC cannot accept this. H.E. Hun Sen also 
appealed to the French Government to use its influence to 
prevent infiltrations by the Khmer Rouge along the border. 
  H.E. Jacques Chirac promised to do all he could to continue 
providing garbage trucks, help Phnom Penh City to have 
sufficient electricity, assist in providing clean water to the 
city, and help train Cambodian students who have just finished 
their studies. 
  As for the RGC's request for the French Government to help 
build a park along the Tonle Sap River in front of the royal 
palace stretching to the base of the Chrouy Changva bridge, H.E. 
Jacques Chirac said studies would be conducted with the Phnom 
Penh City side first.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 11 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has to 
answer for its past terrorist activities and resolve its 
suspected missile exports as preconditions to better relations 
with the United States, two American senators said Tuesday. 
  This is in addition to demands that North Korea comply fully 
with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections and 
engage in dialogue with South Korea, they said. 
  Seoul and Washington share two common goals, Senators Sam 
Nunn and Richard Lugar told a press conference winding up a 
four-day visit to Seoul. 
  The goals are to preserve peace and stability on the Korean 
peninsula, avoid proliferation of nuclear weapons and prevent 
North Korea from becoming a nuclear state, they said. 
  "This challenge we face together, I believe, has to be met 
with firmness, determination and calmness," said Nunn, chairman 
of the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
  North Korea must satisfy the IAEA on inspections of all 
declared and undeclared sites, Nunn listed as one of the terms 
to bettering ties with North Korea. 
  It must also accept all legitimate demands "made by the IAEA 
for the purpose of assuring the world that North Korea is in 
compliance with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and its 
obligation," Nunn said. 
  North Korea would also have to sit down to discuss with 
South 
Korea denuclearizing their peninsula. 
  "Beyond that, there would have to be some understanding and 
discussions regarding North Korea's past behavior in terms of 
terrorism, and also including the case for missile technology," 
he told reporters. 
  Nunn described North Korea's unexpectedly frequent return of 
the purported remains of missing American soldiers from the 
Korean war over the past few months as "one encouraging sign" 
and said solution of the nuclear problem would be a "very 
important first step." 
  The senators' visit has been described as a field trip to 
tap 
all possible countermeasures to North Korea's nuclear problem. 
They came to Seoul after making stops in Moscow and Tokyo. 
  Asked about the viability of economic sanctions and military 
strikes should diplomatic efforts fail, Lugar advised the 
involved parties to be "thoughtful and careful." 
  He repeated President Bill Clinton's words that an attack on 
South Korea is an attack on the United States. 
  "We ought to say we are prepared for all contingencies," 
Lugar said. "But my own view is we ought to be thoughtful, 
patient and persistent and that time is on our side." 
  It's important to apply pressure "without being provocative, 
dramatic," the senator said. 
  Tying what he saw in Russia with North Korea, Nunn warned of 
economic collapse if Pyongyang continues on its present path. 
  "There is a powerful lesson in here (Russia) for North 
Korea," he said. 
  "It's apparent that a nation cannot continue to really have 
an economy that sustains its people if it invests the kind of 
percentage of GNP in defense that Russia did in the past and 
North Korea continues to do today," he said.

<F P=106> [Article by correspondent Kim Hak-sun from the </F>
"International Focus" section] 
  [Text] The improvement of relations between the United 
States and North Korea and between Japan and North Koeea which 
is believed to be realized this year with the appearance of a 
clue to the solution of the North Korean nuclear issue is 
drawing our attention. Depending on North Korea's attitude, 
there is a high possibility that North Korea and the United 
States will establish their respective embassies in Washington 
and Pyongyang within one to two years. 
  Diplomatic observers predict that if the present trend 
continues as it is, the third round of high-level U.S.-North 
Korean talks will be held in February to discuss the matter of 
improving diplomatic relations and economic cooperation between 
them, including the matter of eliminating the suspicion of North 
Korea's nuclear development. 
  Because North Korea is the most closed society in the world 
and distrust between the United States and North Korea is so 
deep, there are many obstacles that should be eliminated before 
diplomatic relations are realized between them. 
<H5>  North Korea's Attitude Cannot Be Foreseen </H5>
  In view of the present situation we can hardly foresee what 
will happen in the negotiations between the United States and 
North Korea even before they realize the third round of their 
high-level talks. This is because North Korea's attitude so far 
has made us believe so. For instance, bilateral negotiations 
that we had believed to be successful have suddenly returned to 
the starting point so frequently that even experts could hardly 
make estimates. 
  At present North Korea has agreed with the United States on 
nuclear inspections and the resumption of North-South dialogue. 
However, many experts wonder if North Korea will sincerely 
discuss detailed procedures for the inspections with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and will provide 
sincere coordination to the IAEA inspections. 
  Diplomatic experts who are critical of North Korea's 
negotiation attitude diagnose that "it is difficult to expect a 
de facto dialogue between North and South Korea because North 
Korea has persistently employed the policy of splitting up the 
cooperative relations between South Korea and the United States 
particularly in connection with the issue of North-South Korean 
dialogue." Of course, South Korean and U.S. officials concerned 
believe that North Korea will have to offer coordination to some 
degree if it finds this necessary. 
  The United States thinks that if North Korea sincerely shows 
its intention to hold dialogue with South Korea, the ROK 
Government will not oppose the third round of U.S.-North Korean 
high-level talks even before the exchange of special envoys to 
discuss the North- South mutual nuclear inspection issue is 
realized. 
  Many experts on North Korean affairs, including senior 
researcher (Leonard Spector) at the Carnegie Foundation, 
diagnose that because its present internal and external 
realities are completely different from those of the past, North 
Korea will inevitably seek even partial opening up and 
internationalization within a scope that does not hurt its 
present political system. 
  Estimating the overall situation, it is almost certain that 
the third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks will be 
held within several weeks. The U.S. Government position is that 
North Korea and the United States, which have had hostile 
relations for half a century, can discuss all pending issues, 
including the North Korean nuclear issue, at the third round of 
talks where they are to discuss the matter of improving 
political and economic relations. 
<H5>  Normalization May Hardly Come </H5>
  If the third round of high-level talks are held, the United 
States is expected to put forward seven demands to the North 
Korean side, namely, the complete return to the NPT 
[Non-Proliferation Treaty], special inspection of two undeclared 
nuclear sites; tangible progress in inter-Korean dialogue, 
including mutual nuclear inspections; suspension of missile 
exports; improvement of the human rights situation; return of 
the remains of U.S. soldiers killed in the Korean war; cessation 
of terrorist activities; and suspension of denunciation of the 
United States. These demands were put forth also by the Bush 
administration as a precondition for the improvement of U.S. 
relations with North Korea. 
  On the other hand, the North Korean side is expected to come 
up with all the pending issues it wishes to solve with the 
United States--such as the normalization of relations; 
assistance in building light-water moderated reactors; the 
abolition of the Armistice Agreement and the signing of a peace 
agreement; the disbanding of the UN Forces Command and the 
withdrawal of U.S. troops from the ROK; lifting the restrictions 
on trade with and investment in North Korea pursuant to the U.S. 
law on trade with hostile states; lifting the ban on 
communications; a promise not to wage a preemptive nuclear 
strike on North Korea and not to use nuclear weapons against the 
North; economic cooperation; and assistance with North Korean 
entry into international economic bodies--and a call for a 
package solution, according to diplomatic sources in Washington. 
  Will it be possible that all these problems are solved as a 
package deal in the third round of talks and bring about the 
normalization of U.S.-North Korean relations within this year? 
To this question, even the most optimistic observers are 
expressing doubts. 
  Both sides intend to carry through all of their demands in 
the third round of talks, but it is practically impossible to 
settle so many pending issues at one stroke. 
  Indeed, North Korea is eager to normalize its relations with 
the United States, but if it fails to be so successful as 
establishing its embassy in the United States, it may well try 
to establish a liaison office or a trade mission within this 
year to concentrate on economic cooperation, according to an 
analysis of diplomatic experts. 
  U.S. Under Secretary of State Lynn Davis stressed on 5 
January that in the third round of talks, the United States will 
certainly induce North Korea to accede to special inspections. 
<H5>  Flexibility for Special Inspection </H5>
  The experts, however, are of the opinion that North Korea 
will take a stubborn attitude of refusing to permit the first 
ever special inspection of the undeclared nuclear sites by the 
IAEA, thus using it as a card for negotiation. 
  Because of this position of North Korea, the third round of 
talks is likely to come up against quite a few difficulties. 
Therefore, four or five or more round of talks could be 
necessary, involving many rounds of unofficial contacts for each 
of them. 
  However, as to the method of nuclear inspections, the United 
States and the IAEA hinted a flexibility of considering methods 
that could bring about the effect of inspection close to the 
special inspection without using the term "special inspection." 
This enhances the chances for reaching compromise. There is a 
high probability that the special inspection will be linked with 
the inter-Korean mutual nuclear inspection including inspection 
of the U.S. military bases in the ROK, thus complicating the 
process for the solution of the problem, diplomatic sources said. 
  The officials, in particular, revealed that there is a high 
possibility that the North Korean side will utilize this issue 
as a means for "adjustment of speed." Diplomatic observers in 
Washington believe that there was a previous instance that North 
Korea suspended the mutual visits of separated families while it 
was partially pushing ahead with them after having judged that 
the visits were harmful to maintaining its system. Therefore, it 
is highly likely that North Korea will push for the improvement 
of relations with the United States while continuing the 
political and diplomatic evaluation of its efforts for the 
improvement. 
<H5>  Dependence on Adjustment of Speed by the North </H5>
  Meanwhile, the U.S. side is regarding the issue of missile 
proliferation as a very sensitive issue no less than the nuclear 
issue. Therefore, it is likely that the United States will not 
allow the improvement of relations without the solution to this 
problem. At the same time, the observers predict that the human 
rights issue, to which the Clinton administration attaches as 
much importance as that to nonproliferation of mass lethal 
weapons, will emerge as a major pending issue when 
ambassador-level envoys are exchanged, although the issue may 
not be a grave obstacle at the stage of establishing liaison 
offices. 
  A U.S. State Department official said that "one should pay 
keen attention to the development of ROK-China relations before 
reading the script of improvement of U.S.-North Korea 
relations," thus strongly suggesting a method of step-by-step 
approaches. 
  In addition to the U.S. Government, a diplomatic expert who 
maintains close relations with North Korea noted that "epochal 
steps, including the disbanding of the UN Command and 
replacement of the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement, 
should be taken before the two sides formally establish 
diplomatic relations." He added that "it seems that this issue 
will not be resolved simply in the future few months" and that 
"the establishment of mutual liaison offices within this year 
itself, if realized, should be assessed as successful." 
  He revealed that "North Korea seems to wish that the United 
States will open communications with North Korea first of all, 
exclude North Korea from being subject to application of the law 
on trade with hostile countries, and open the door for economic 
relations with it." He pointed to the great possibility that 
North Korea will attach greater importance to economic 
cooperation than to formal diplomatic relations, which will 
rapidly accelerate its opening up, in a bid to maintain its 
system. 
  He observed that the North Korean side's request for U.S. 
support for construction of a light-water atomic reactor is 
aimed at making the United States lift its restrictions on 
investment and trade. Some other observers note that there is a 
possibility that North Korea will, as in the past, pursue a 
"package deal solution." However, North Korea is not in a 
position to immediately accept all of the U.S. side's demands. 
  In conclusion, it is a common view of experts that the 
script 
concerning the establishment of diplomatic relations between the 
United States and North Korea will vary in different forms 
according to the degree of adjusting the speed by the North 
Korean side. There is also a pessimistic view that even the 
establishment of liaison offices will not be possible within 
this year.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 11 (YONHAP) -- Inter-Korean trade fell 6 
percent in 1993 from 1992 because of North Korea's foreign 
exchange situation and overall coolness in relations, the Trade, 
Industry and Energy Ministry said Tuesday. 
  Two-way trade last year was 200,643,000 U.S. dollars, 
compared with 213,503,000 dollars in 1992. 
  South Korea sold 10,224,000 dollars of goods to the North, 
down 20.2 percent, and purchased 190,419,000 dollars of goods, 
down 5.1 percent. 
  Purchase of goods processed on commission in North Korea, 
mainly textile goods, skyrocketed 729 percent to 4,388,000 
dollars in nine cases last year. 
  In processing on commission, South Korean companies provide 
North Korean factories with raw materials and buy the finished 
products. 
  "North Korean technology to manufacture high-value added 
products, such as jackets and men's suits is very good, and the 
products are competitive on the Japanese market as well as on 
the domestic market," a Ministry official said. 
  Industrial goods accounted for 89.3 percent of the purchased 
North Korean goods, compared with 80.8 percent a year before, 
but the proportion of agricultural products decreased to 10.7 
percent from 19.2 percent in 1992. 
  Purchases of gold ingots, textiles, walnuts and alcoholic 
beverages increased, while those of cement, oriental medicines 
and fisheries products dropped.

  [Text] It has been learned that even though North Korea 
enacted laws aimed at attracting foreign capital in 1992, 
including a law guaranteeing foreign investment, only three 
joint-venture businesses have been set up in North Korea. 
  In addition, the number of joint-venture companies doing 
business in North Korea has diminished from 120 to 20, Yi 
Yong-tok, deputy premier and national unification minister, said 
on 10 January in a report to the National Assembly Foreign 
Affairs-Unification Committee. 
  According to the report, the three joint-venture companies 
that were established in the last year are Aeguk Adhesion Plant, 
Aeguk Color Television Assembly Plant, and Myongsim 
Joint-Venture Company manufacturing graphite, which are all 
jointly invested with Japanese companies. 
  The report revealed that there is a great possibility that 
North Korea has transferred initiative for economic policies 
from the Workers' Party of North Korea to the Administration 
Council as part of a policy attaching great importance to 
professionalism rather than partisanship.

  [Text] It is estimated that because of the damage caused 
by the cold weather last year in North Korea, the harvest of its 
major grains, including rice and corn, has decreased by 15-20 
percent compared with the average crop of 5.10 million tonnes. 
In the case of steel production, however, due to reinforcement 
of facilities at the Chollima steel mill in Nampo city and the 
Hwanghae steel mill in Songnim city, production has increased by 
about 200,000 tonnes. 
  At the National Assembly Foreign Affairs and National 
Unification Committee on 10 January, the National Unification 
Board [NUB] reported on trends in North Korea based on recently 
obtained information. The following are trends in North Korea 
in the political, economic, military, and social fields, as 
reported by the NUB. 
<H5>  Politics </H5>
  It seems that while strengthening the unity centered on the 
two "leaders" Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il, the "Kim Chong-il 
era" will be formulated on a full scale. At the 8 November 1993 
journalists congress, North Korea called President Kim Il-song 
"the great leader," and Kim Chong-il, chairman of the National 
Defense Commission, "the sagacious leader of our party and 
people." 
  Nevertheless, dissatisfaction over Kim Chong-il is 
increasing 
among the North Korean people. There are rumors of discontent 
by the people saying: "Rice and meat were sufficient in the 
seventies but our lives became difficult from the time the 
"thoughtless child" Kim Chong-il started to carry out politics." 
Therefore, the North Korean authorities are strengthening 
surveillance of the people through the State Security Defense 
Department, which has been placed under the control of Kim 
Chong-il. 
<H5>  Economics </H5>
  During the early part of last year the volume of trade with 
China, North Korea's largest trading partner, increased 39 
percent compared with 1992. Export was $120 million and import 
was $310 million. However, the volume of trade with Japan 
decreased by 2.6 percent compared with 1992. Export was $110 
million and import was $110 million. 
  In 1992 North Korea established a series of laws to lure 
foreign capital, such as the foreign investment law. 
Nevertheless, in 1993 only three joint venture companies were 
set up. Among the 120 joint venture companies established in 
North Korea, only 20 remain at this time. 
  The provisions North Korea imported from Thailand, Canada, 
China, and other countries from January to August last year 
amounted to 645,000 tonnes. It is expected that the crude oil 
North Korea imported during the first half of the last year 
amounted to 1.1 million tonnes. It seems that the electric 
power situation in North Korea has worsened. It has been 
learned that the operations of large plants and power stations, 
including the Sunchon vinalon complex, Sariwon potash fertilizer 
plant, and Tongpyongyang thermal power station, have actually 
stopped. It has been reported that to overcome such an economic 
difficulty, the party has transferred the task of working out 
economic policy to the Administration Council. 
<H5>  Military </H5>
  North Korea has constantly built up war potential by 
deploying additional large-caliber long-range guns along the 
front line and by reinforcing district commands. By deploying 
170-mm self-propelled artillery with a range of 54 km and 240-mm 
multiple rocket launchers with a range of 70 km along the front 
line, North Korea brings Seoul and Suwon into target range. In 
addition, North Korea has augmented the three division-level 
district commands of Yanggang Province, Chagang Province, and 
North Hwanghae Province into corps level. 
  Setting up last year as the "year to complete war 
preparations," North Korea has stockpiled war supplies large 
enough to conduct war for three or five months without external 
supplies. It has also reinforced underground facilities. 
<H5>  Society </H5>
  Capitalist concepts are flowing into North Korea through 
foreign students, traders, diplomats, and Chinese compatriots. 
Western-style fashions are spreading among youth. Youth with 
long hair have been appearing in Pyongyang City since 1987. 
Since 1988, youth have enjoyed listening to rock music and 
disco dancing in secret. Blue jeans and bell-bottomed trousers 
have been catching on among youth since 1990. 
  As a result of life difficulties, phrases, such as "Let us 
live together," "Let us share things equally," and "Let us make 
an arrangement," are catching on among residents. Even slang -- 
calling thieves "life coordination committees," calling 
robberies "redistribution of wealth," and calling stolen goods 
"life coordination committee's goods" -- are spreading. 
  Since 1989, private loan businesses have been frequent among 
black-market merchants in North Hamgyong Province districts. The 
Korean card game, "go-and-stop," has been spread in North Korea 
by Chinese compatriots and Chinese emigrants.

  [Text] North Korea is calling for reunification through 
the confederal system and is urging our youth and students to 
carry out "the reunification struggle" from the beginning of the 
new year. In his New Year address, Kim Il-song emphasized that 
"the only method for reunification" is through the confederal 
system. Also, from 1-7 January North Korea concentratedly 
discussed the reunification issue on 24 occasions through press 
statements by its high-ranking authorities and special articles. 
  Kim Pyong-sik, DPRK vice president and chairman of the 
Korean 
Social Democratic Party, emphasized on 4 January: "All fellow 
countrymen in the North, South, and overseas must transcend 
differences in ideology, ideas, political views, and religion 
under the banner of the 10-point program of great national unity 
to firmly unite as one so that they can all vigorously launch 
into the work to found a pannational reunified state through the 
confederal system method." 
  In the 3 January special article aired by Pyongyang radio it 
emphasized: "The South Korean youth and students, who are 
enthusiastically patriotic and who have a strong sense of 
justness, must firmly unite with the people from all walks of 
life in the new year to vigorously carry out the struggle to 
achieve reunification through the confederal system method." 
  In particular, North Korea is instigating our youth and 
students by saying that "there is nothing to expect from the 
current South Korean Government." North Korea is denouncing our 
government by saying that there is no progress in the 
reunification issue because of the South side's dependency on 
outside forces and the promotion of its confrontational policy. 
  Such moves by North Korea is related to the fact that North 
Korea is working to make 1995 "the first year of reunification." 
This implies various significance. 
  It is not known exactly when but there are rumors by the 
North Korean people that "1995 will be the year of 
reunification." This was also shown when the North Korean 
people unhesitatingly told the members of our delegation of such 
moves who went to Pyongyang from 1990-1992 to participate in the 
South-North high-ranking talks. However, it is not clear whether 
North Korea officially set such a date for reunification. 
  At the 7 November 1988 combined meeting of party organs, 
Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam had emphasized: "We must work to 
make the year 1995, the 50th anniversary of national division 
and 50th anniversary of the fatherland's liberation, as a 
historical year in completing the sacred cause of reunification 
without fail." Through propaganda media toward South Korea such 
as the South Korea National Democratic Front, North Korea 
frequently said "1995 is the first year of reunification." 
  The government views that such moves by North Korea are to 
unconsciously make the "South and North Korean people" realize 
that "reunification will be achieved in 1995." Thus, this is 
viewed as a strategy to make a more favorable condition to form 
a reunification front. In particular, from last year North 
Korea has been promoting on a full scale the preparation work to 
strengthen the reunification front. Such work is "the 10-point 
program of great national unity" announced by Kim Il-song, and 
the appointment Kim Pyong-sik and Yu Mi-yong (wife of Choe 
Tok-sin) who are from the South and overseas fellow countrymen, 
and Kang Chu-il who was in charge of operations of the 
pro-Pyongyang Federation of Korean Residents in Japan, as 
directors of the party reunification front. 
  We can view that there are some strategic intentions based 
on 
advance work for North Korea to strengthen propaganda on the 
reunification issue from the beginning of the new year. In this 
connection an official of the National Unification Board said: 
"When considering the fact that next year will be the first year 
of reunification is widely spreading among the people, it seems 
that the priority goal of North Korea is to seek unity at home 
and abroad by turning the interest of the people to the 
reunification issue." 
  He added: "Another intention of North Korea is to lure the 
antigovernment struggle through the reunification issue. 
Therefore, it seems that this year North Korea will work to 
actively improve its relations with the United States, while 
carrying out a multifaceted offensive against the South based on 
the reunification front strategy."

  [Text] Since it was confirmed that the United States and 
Japan exported rice and some other products to North Korea, a 
strong call for the comprehensive review of the government's 
policy on North Korea to link the nuclear issue with economic 
cooperation has been put forward from the business sector. 
  On 9 January, a relevant official from the business sector 
said: We recently received a request from North Korea for the 
export of rice, maize, and gasoline. Since the United States 
exports rice to North Korea, I do not see the reason why we 
cannot export rice to North Korea. 
  According to the annual report recently submitted to the 
U.S. 
Congress by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. 
Government, which officially banned export of goods to North 
Korea, allowed export of grains including rice and some other 
products from the humanitarian view of point. The total amount 
of export was learned to be $137 million in seven cases during 
the fiscal year 1992. 
  Another relevant official from the business sector said that 
"in addition to the United States, Japan exported even strategic 
materials to North Korea through the General Association of 
Korean Residents in Japan. Recently, Japan is actively striving 
to hold official and unofficial contacts with North Korea to 
resume negotiations for establishment of diplomatic relations. 
This being the case, if our economic cooperation with North 
Korea is linked to the nuclear issue and our export of rice is 
restricted on the pretext of being a strategic material, it 
would be difficult for the government to effect its policy to 
achieve national reunification by making North Korea open itself 
up." 
  Sin Chang-ho, professor at Chungang University and chairman 
of the Research Institute of Unification and Economy, also 
pointed out: 
  Even if North Korea agrees to accept nuclear inspections by 
the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], it will require a 
number of procedures and much time to ensure nuclear 
transparency. The present situation, in which a clue is found 
for the solution of the nuclear problem through contacts between 
the United States and North Korea and between North Korea and 
the IAEA, is an adequate time for our government to demonstrate 
flexibility in its policy on economic cooperation with North 
Korea. 
  Meanwhile, it was learned that the government began to 
examine the flexibility to be given to the principle of 
implementing phased economic cooperation according to progress 
in negotiations over the North Korean nuclear issue and to the 
degree of solution of the nuclear issue. 
  A relevant government official said: During U.S.-North Korea 
contacts, North Korea agreed in principle to accept inspection 
of seven nuclear facilities. Therefore, the necessity arose to 
intensively examine the first-phase policy which defined "a 
breakthrough for solution to nuclear issue," the second-phase 
and the third-phase policies. 
  In particular, if North Korea accepts IAEA's nuclear 
inspection and responds to the exchange of special envoys, the 
government will affirmatively review the time of visit to North 
Korea by businessmen and technicians and their advance to free 
economic zones in North Korea through third countries including 
China. 
  In the event that North Korea completely returns to the 
nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and accepts the inspection of 
two undeclared sites by IAEA, the government, regarding this as 
a "breakthrough for a solution to the nuclear issue," will 
permit the businessmen's visit to North Korea, as well as the 
visit of technicians in a bid to invigorate processing-for-wage 
deals. 
  In addition, the government will resume model projects if 
North Korea accepts mutual inspections of the North and the 
South and will resume overall economic cooperation if 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is realized.

  [Text] The ROK and Japan have agreed to set up the 
ROK-Japanese Organization for New Economic Cooperation in March 
and, thus, will enter activities in a full-fledged manner. 
  As President Kim Yong-sam and Japanese Prime Minister 
Hosokawa, during the November summit, agreed in principle to 
establish a new consultative organ to discuss economic issues, 
the two countries have been engaged in mapping out plans in 
details and recently reached a deal to found the organization, 
according to a Foreign Ministry official on 9 January. 
  The ROK-Japan Organization for New Economic Cooperation will 
comprehensively deal with various bilateral issues--including 
economy, trade, measures to cope with a trade imbalance, and 
cooperation in industrial technology--unlike its past way of 
tackling bilateral economic issues by each field.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 10 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu pledged more voluntary contributions to UN 
aid for refugees in addition to manpower donations Monday. 
  Han promised visiting UN High Commissioner for Refugees 
Sadako Ogata wider assistance for the commission, said Ham 
Myong-chol, director-general of international organizations. 
  Seoul's contribution to the United Nations as a member state 
accounts for 0.69 percent of the U.N. budget, but its voluntary 
donations to other international bodies such as the commission 
is 0.04 percent. 
  Korea gave 150,000 U.S. dollars to the commission last year, 
when it joined the convention on better protection and welfare 
of the refugees. This ranks 28th among the 48 contributor 
nations. 
  While increasing the amount of monetary donations, Han said, 
the government could send medical and other emergency aid teams 
to troubled areas. 
  These teams may be sent as part of youth volunteer programs 
at the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), a Foreign 
Ministry umbrella institution, he said.

  [Text] The government plans to conclude investment 
protection agreements with 10 developing nations this year to 
help domestic companies invest more easily in the countries, 
Foreign Ministry officials said yesterday [10 January]. 
  The nations involved are India, Hong Kong, Papua New Guinea, 
Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Panama, Egypt, Algeria and Kazakhstan. 
  An official said that the countries are expected to attract 
more investment from Korean companies. As of the end of last 
June, Korean firms had invested an estimated $365 million in the 
10 countries. 
  Domestic companies are expected to be active in investment 
in 
India in the wake of Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's visit 
to Seoul last September, the official said. 
  With Hong Kong, Korea should take action after 1997 when the 
island state will be handed over to China, he said, adding that 
there has been no investment pact signed by the two sides 
although Korea and China concluded a similar pact last year. 
  Mexico is important as it is a member of the three-nation 
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) put into effect Jan. 
1 this year. Mexico without investment guarantee pacts with 
foreign countries due to a constitutional ban is seeking such 
pacts to attract foreign investment, he said. 
  The agreement with Argentina will be signed soon as 
obstacles 
have been brushed away, the official said. The government is 
also seeking an agreement with Kazakhstan as domestic companies 
are eager to invest in the country which has a large number of 
ethnic Koreans. 
  Korea has concluded investment protection pacts with 24 
countries and initialed them with eight.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 11 (YONHAP) -- The Iljin Group, ordered 
by a U.S. Federal District Court to stop manufacturing 
synthetic industrial diamonds for allegedly pirating a trade 
secret of General Electric Co., joins a club of Korean companies 
wounded in fierce rows with foreign firms and inventors over 
patents. 
  According to a survey by the Korean Industrial Property 
Office (KIPO), Samsung Electronics Co., Goldstar Co., Hyundai 
Electronics Co., Daewoo Electronics Co., Goldstar Electron Co., 
and Samsung Electron Devices Co. received 220 warnings and were 
slapped with 13 lawsuits by foreign companies for patent 
violations between 1990 and 1993. 
  Among the foreign complainants, American companies such as 
IBM, Microsoft, Intel, SGS Thomson, and Texas Instruments 
account for 61.3 percent with a total of 143. 
  Patent quarrels do not end at corporations, but are 
frequently brought up by inventors like Gerome Lemelson and 
Gilbert Hyatt of America, who demand high royalties for their 
discoveries. 
  Lemelson won royalties of 21 million U.S. dollars from 
Goldstar, Samsung, and Goldstar Electron, equivalent to the 
1986-1995 exports of the three companies, last year for his 
patents on 33 technologies, including computer image analysis, 
camcorders and laser discs. 
  He is said to be now negotiating royalties with Hyundai, 
Daewoo, and Hyundai Motor Co. 
  Backed by Philips, Hyatt is seeking his patent dues for 20 
computer and semiconductor items and has sent warnings to 
Samsung, Goldstar and Daewoo to pay royalties equal to 1 percent 
of their turnover. 
  Refac Co., a U.S. agency fighting for patent rights on 
behalf 
of American clients, brings up technologies that have long been 
disregarded in the United States, according to KIPO officials. 
  Thirty cases, or 13 percent of the total complaints and 
lawsuits, were lodged by Refac. 
  Korean companies pay royalties because the inventors have no 
commercialized product in America that they can trade with their 
patented articles, officials say. 
  Corporations prefer "cross license" contracts for patent 
exchanges instead of royalties, they say. 
  American companies do not touch Japanese firms lest they be 
counter-sued with their negotiating abilities in intellectual 
property rights, they say.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 11 (YONHAP) -- The government will seek 
to increase corporate investment overseas through increased 
foreign exchange loans from the Bank of Korea to head off 
pressure for increasing the money supply in the overseas sector 
and strengthening the won against the U.S. dollar, as the 
overall balance of payments position is expected to improve from 
last year's surplus of 6.5 billion U.S. dollars to 10 billion 
dollars this year. 
  The balance of payments comprises current transactions 
(international trade of goods and services) and capital 
transactions (international trade of securities and debts). 
  To increase foreign-exchange loans for increased corporate 
investment overseas, the Bank of Korea will improve the terms, 
including lower interest rates and longer repayment periods than 
foreign bank loans, Economic Planning Board officials said 
Tuesday. 
  The introduction of foreign commercial (bank) loans will be 
limited to those importing equipment needed in infrastructure 
expansion projects. 
  The settlement period for imports on a deferred payment 
basis 
will be extended and the ceiling on export advance receipts will 
be raised to increase trade on a short-term credit basis, the 
officials said. 
  To expedite overseas investment, the number of corporations 
eligible to invest overseas will be increased, restrictions on 
real estate investment abroad will be eased and support will be 
given to those investing in agricultural and resources 
development projects overseas. 
  The number of institutional investors eligible to invest in 
foreign capital markets will be expanded, along with an increase 
in their overseas investment ceiling, while the Bank of Korea's 
swap system, whereby investors buy foreign exchange from the 
central bank with resale agreement, will be expanded for 
increased investment in the foreign securities market. 
  In addition, the export-import Bank of Korea's funds 
supporting exports on a medium- and long-term credit basis will 
be increased, restrictions on settlement of current transactions 
in foreign exchange will be eased and rules governing the 
raising of funds denominated in foreign currencies in the 
countries where a company operates will be improved to their 
advantage.

  [Text] The slight but steady decline of the Japanese yen's 
value against the U.S. dollar is alarming Korean business 
concerns which have already set their business plans for this 
year out of the assumption that the Japanese currency may 
further appreciate. 
  They are of the opinion that they will have to adjust their 
projected investments and turnout and export goals downwards in 
case the present depreciation trend of the yen against the 
greenback continues. 
  They fear that their business projects set for the year 
won't 
be able to be carried out as scheduled. 
  To cope with the impact of the changing value of the 
Japanese 
currency on their business, they are strengthening their 
international financing teams as a way to reinforce their roles 
in estimating foreign exchange fluctuations. 
  They are also groping for steps for each of their products 
to 
counter the clout of the yen's depreciation. But they are 
troubled as they have not found practical measures as yet. 
  They estimated the exchange rate of the Japanese currency 
against the U.S. dollar at the onset of the year at 105-107 yen 
per greenback, while predicting the yen's value would drop in 
the second half of the year. 
  They were unanimous in believing that even though the value 
of the yen against the U.S. dollar drops, the exchange rate will 
not fall below 110 yen per greenback. 
  Based on their conjecture of how the value of the yen will 
fluctuate, they mapped out their business plans for the year 
including their export and total sales targets. 
  However, their estimation of the yen's value against the 
greenback proved wrong from the start of the year as the parity 
rate hovers between 112-113 yen per collar at present. 
  On Jan. 4, the exchange rate soared to 113.27 yen per 
dollar. 
It dropped to 112 yen yesterday. 
  Some monetary experts even forecast that the parity rate 
would soon rise to the level of 120 yen per dollar. The 
depreciation of the Japanese currency to the 120 yen level will 
deal a deadly blow to Korean products in international markets. 
  Last year, Korea enjoyed an estimated $15-20 million trade 
surplus on a current account basis, the first figure in the 
black since 1989, which was mainly attributed to the strong 
value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar and other 
major currencies in international money markets. 
  A researcher at the Samsung Economic Research Institute 
predicted that the present low value of the Japanese currency 
would continue to persist for quite a while. 
  He said that the prolonged depreciation of the yen will 
seriously afflict exports of such major products as cars, ships 
and electronics. 
  It is generally expected that auto-makers, which regained 
their export competitiveness last year thanks to the 
appreciation of the Japanese yen, will be hit hardest. 
  An official at Hyundai Motor said that the parity rate of 
the 
Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar is running in a 
disadvantageous direction for Korea quite contrary to general 
expectations. 
  He worried that as long as the value of the Japanese yen 
against the U.S. dollar remains weak, it is inevitable for 
Korean cars to substantially lose their price competitiveness in 
the United States, the 12-member European Community and other 
advanced countries. 
  Shipbuilders are also worrying about the deterioration of 
their business conditions because their Japanese counterparts 
are expected to recover their competitiveness due to the 
depreciation of the yen. 
  Last year, Korea superseded Japan as the world's biggest 
shipbuilder, which was ascribed to the strong value of the 
Japanese currency in international money markets. 
  Many business experts are apprehensive that as Korean 
shipbuilders are saturated with orders at present, they might 
lose their hegemony in the world shipbuilding market if Japanese 
makers go on the offensive by lowering prices of their products, 
taking advantage of the yen's lower value against the U.S. 
dollar. 
  Textile makers are also expected to suffer from the 
depreciation of the Japanese currency. 
  On their assumption that the value of the yen will continue 
to decrease against the U.S. dollar, Korean enterprises, mostly 
those affiliated with business groups, are endeavoring hard to 
lower their production costs and improve their productivity.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Cho Chae-hyon] </F>
  [Text] The Bank of Korea [BOK] has expressed concern over 
the impact the surging foreign money inflow will have on its 
monetary management for this year. 
  Kim Yong-tae, chief of the central bank's Monetary 
Department, said yesterday [7 January] that the foreign capital 
influx will hit a record high this year. 
  Kim said that foreign capital totalling 8-9 trillion won 
(10-12 billion dollars) will flow into Korea this year. 
  The BOK said that it plans to supply about 15.5-18.8 
trillion 
won in liquidity during 1994. 
  Accordingly, the foreign money inflow will account for about 
50 percent of the total money supply growth this year. It means 
half of this year's additional money supply will be set 
depending on the foreign capital inflow. 
  The total money supply growth which peaked at 21.4 percent 
in 
last October has shown signs of declining since November and 
reached 17.4 percent in December on an outstanding monthly 
average basis. 
  M2 increased by 1.78 trillion won in December from the 
previous month to 110.76 trillion won on an outstanding average 
basis. M2 includes currency in circulation and demand, time and 
savings deposits. 
  The central bank is poised to tighten its reign on money 
growth in order to reduce inflationary pressure which has been 
building up since the beginning of the year led by rises in 
public services prices. 
  The most important challenge facing the central bank is how 
to hold down consumer prices, Kim said. 
  In that context, the rising foreign money inflow is emerging 
as a big burden to the central bank's fight against inflation 
because it will result in fanning prices. 
  In order to offset the rise in money supply in the foreign 
sector, the BOK will have to tighten its control on money growth 
on the domestic side. 
  As the central bank released huge amounts of money last year 
in the name of cushioning impacts following the implementation 
of the real-name financial transaction system, the overflow of 
funds has become a key factor for the current downward trend in 
money growth. 
  The central bank did not fail to point out positive impacts 
of foreign capital. 
  The BOK said that although total money supply growth will 
continue to decline, the liquidity conditions for enterprises 
will be in good shape because the capital inflow will boost the 
stock market and give companies more chances to increase their 
reliance on direct financing like issuing bonds and stocks. 
  For January, the central bank said it set its monetary 
growth 
target at 17-17.9 percent, compared with 17.5 percent growth a 
year ago. It will release about 2.5-3.3 trillion won during 
this month. 
  In the meantime, money market rates, as measured by 
three-year corporate bond yields, remain stable at about 12 
percent at present, compared with 13.35 percent in December 1992. 
  Reflecting the good liquidity conditions in the market, 
inter-bank short-term call rates also are hovering at the 12 
percent range, lower than the 14 percent a year ago. 
  Market analysts agree that interest rates in the money 
market 
will not rise at least till the beginning of the second quarter 
when firms's fund demands are likely to rise because they are 
expected to activate investments from April.

<F P=106> [By Yu Kun-ha] </F>
  [Text] Sharp growth in the exports of computers and 
communications equipment last year pulled the domestic 
electronics industry out of the sluggishness of 1992. 
  This year, the high export growth rate of over 20 percent 
marked in 1993 is likely to be maintained, expanding the 
industry's exports from $5.1 billion to $6.2 billion. This 
projection by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy 
(MOTIE), however, is based on the condition that the Japanese 
yen remains strong. Signs are emerging, however, which indicate 
a weakening of the Japanese currency. 
  Production of computer hardware, telephones, facsimiles, 
telephone exchanges and other equipment amounted to about $8.2 
billion last year, up 13.4 percent from 1992. 
  This year, the aggregate output is expected to grow by 17 
percent and hit $9.6 billion. Domestic demand for computers and 
personal communications equipment will also expand by around 9 
percent with the advance of the nation toward an 
information-based society. 
  The industry's single largest export item is computer 
monitors. The nation's four major monitor producers -- Samsung, 
Goldstar, Hyundai and Daewoo -- churned out a total of $2 
billion worth of monitors last year, accounting for about 30 
percent of the world market in terms of quantity last year. In 
terms of value, Korea is second only to Taiwan in the monitor 
market. 
  Monitor producers are expected to enjoy brisk business this 
year as demand for personal computers in the United States is 
recovering while that in the European Community will continue to 
increase sharply. 
  Exports of personal computers (PCs) are also expected to 
rise, by some 20 percent, this year, if demand in the United 
States, which accounts for 80 percent of Korean shipments 
abroad, continues to center around the 486-class PCs. 
  More than half of PC exports, however, will be made under 
the 
OEM (original equipment manufacturer) formula. Samsung, the 
largest of the Big Five computer makers, showed the highest OEM 
rate -- 84 percent of its exports worth $190 million last year 
were made under the OEM formula. 
  Sambo, which is the leader in the domestic market, was 
second 
with 58 percent, while the remaining three -- Goldstar, Daewoo 
and Hyundai -- exported 90 percent of their PCs with their own 
brand names attached. 
  In all, the five computer assemblers are forecast to export 
$539 million worth of PCs this year, a level which still falls 
far short of 1991's $719 million. 
  For the Korean mass producers, 1992 was a disastrous year. 
In that year, world PC demand shifted from the 286-class to the 
386- class and then to the 486-class. The change was simply too 
rapid for the Korean mass producers, who were unable to alter 
their production lines. As a result, exports were more than 
halved to a mere $332 million. 
  The five PC makers plan to spend some $44 million for 
research and development of high-function notebook computers, 
the so-called personal digital assistants (PDAs), multimedia 
PCs, Pentium PCs and other high value-added products. 
  Exports of computers and peripheral equipment are projected 
to total $3.78 billion this year, up 20 percent from the 1993 
estimate of $3.15 billion. 
  In the telecommunications field, exports are expected to 
grow 
at a similar rate to that of the computer industry. Production, 
however, will grow by a far lower rate of 8 percent on average 
mainly because of the expected low demand for wire 
telecommunications equipment and a sharp drop in Korea Telecom's 
purchase of domestic telephone exchanges. 
  In contrast, domestic demand for mobile telecommunications 
devices such as pagers and cellular phones will continue to grow 
rapidly, causing a corresponding increase in imports of these 
products. 
  Last year, over half of the domestic demand for cellular 
phones was met by Motorola, the world leader in this field. 
Samsung, Goldstar and Hyundai, the three key Korean players in 
the market, accounted for 16 percent, 12 percent and 4 percent 
of sales, respectively. New firms are entering into this fast 
growing and lucrative business. 
  Exports of telephones, especially cellular phones, and 
facsimiles are expected to grow by over 20 percent this year as 
domestic producers are turning out new products. 
  Telephone exports (wire, cordless and cellular) are forecast 
to total $463 million, up 22 percent from 1993, while facsimile 
shipments will grow by 26.5 percent to mark $215 million. 
  Korean-developed digital telephone exchanges are also likely 
to see a sharp increase in exports. The three producers who 
jointly developed the TDX exchange -- Samsung, Goldstar and 
Daewoo -- are eager to explore new markets for the products. 
The three plan to raise their combined exports to $105 million 
this year, up 28 percent from 1993. 
  Domestic demand for the exchanges, however, will grow only 3 
to 4 percent as Korea Telecom has been reducing its purchases 
with the progress in its telephone network modernization program.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 11 (YONHAP) -- Korea's 10 largest 
business groups had exports of 47.32 billion U.S. dollars last 
year, or 57.4 percent of total exports, the Trade, Industry and 
Energy Ministry said Tuesday. 
  Samsung, Hyundai, Lucky-Goldstar and Daewoo accounted for 
40.2 percent of Korea's total exports of 82.44 billion dollars. 
  Samsung ranked first with 12.7 percent of exports, up from 
11.2 percent a year earlier. 
  Hyundai ranked second with 8.3 billion dollars, off 370 
million dollars because of labor disputes at 10 percent, down 
from 11.3 percent. Hyundai led Samsung last year at 8.67 
billion dollars to 8.6 billion dollars. 
  Lucky-Goldstar was stable in third place at 7.7 billion 
dollars, or 9.3 percent of exports compared with 9.2 percent in 
1992. 
  Daewoo followed at 6.8 billion dollars (8.2 percent), Hanjin 
at 4.81 billion dollars (5.8 percent), Sunkyong at 4.48 billion 
dollars (5.4 percent), Ssangyong at 2.6 billion dollars (3.1 
percent) and Kia at 1.1 billion dollars (1.3 percent). 
  The Hyosung Group had 2.64 billion dollars in exports, or 
3.2 
percent, for sixth place, but is not among the 10 biggest groups. 
  Hanwha and Lotte ranked ninth and tenth at 0.7 percent and 
0.4 percent, respectively. 
  Ssangyong slipped from 3.2 percent to 3.1 percent, but the 
rest improved their figures.

<F P=106> [By Kim Myong-chol] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 11 (YONHAP) -- Increased international 
competitiveness and stable and steady growth are the goals of 
the government's economic plan for 1994, announced Tuesday. 
  The plan, formulated about a month later than in previous 
years because of a cabinet reshuffle affecting the economic 
planning minister and other ministers with economic portfolios 
in December, puts stress on developing the rural economy and 
putting vigor into the private sector. 
  In a conspicuous departure from past practice, the 
government 
left its forecast of macroeconomic indicators such as growth and 
inflation rates out of the plan. 
  Instead, the plan contains forecasts of such indicators by 
the Korea Development Institute, the Bank of Korea and private 
research institutes that put average growth at 6 percent to 7 
percent, inflation at 6 percent and the current-account surplus 
at anywhere from 1 billion to 2 billion U.S. dollars. 
  The government does have its own forecasts, but did not 
include them in the plan to avoid criticism if the forecasts 
turn out to be wrong. But this creates the impression that the 
government is shirking its responsibility. 
  If the plan included the government's macroeconomic goals, 
the government would then feel impelled to drive the economy to 
achieve the goals regardless of how unreasonable such a drive 
may be, as it did in the past, Economic Planning Board (EPB) 
officials say. But without the government goals, the business 
community has no way of knowing exactly what the government is 
aiming at in its economic management plan. 
  An EPB official says the government wants 7-percent growth 
and 6-percent inflation in this year, but farm market opening as 
a result of the Uruguay Round trade talks has caused the 
government to put stress on rural development programs. 
  These programs combine with others for boosting the private 
sector, expanding infrastructure and balancing development of 
the country to give the impression that the economic management 
plan for 1994 focuses more on growth than on stability. 
  Chang Song-u, the EPB planning officer in charge of the 
plan, 
says that the plan's macroeconomic emphasis is on stability and 
its microeconomic emphasis is on programs to maximize business 
activities of the private sector. To stabilize prices, the 
government will control the total money supply on a stable basis 
and restrain earlier implementation of public works projects. 
  To increase industry's international competitiveness in the 
severe trade war expected as a result of the Uruguay Round trade 
accord, the North American free trade agreement and the European 
economic area, the plan envisages five programs -- agricultural 
restructuring, deregulation for a higher spirit of enterprise in 
the private sector, expansion of infrastructure, increased 
adaptation to trends of globalization through market opening and 
price stabilization. 
  The rural development programs include both government and 
private investment for developing rural areas into a complex of 
primary, secondary and tertiary industries, and for this the 
government will in July begin raising 1.5 trillion won a year by 
establishing a new tax for several years. 
  Deregulation will include the privatization of state-run 
enterprises and the opening of the public works market to 
private capital. 
  For price stabilization, prices of rice and 29 other daily 
necessities will be kept from rising more than 4 percent, on 
average, in the coming year, while prices of 140 monopoly and 
oligopoly items will be placed under strict controls. 
  The economy, which bottomed out last year, looks bright in 
the new year. Increasing international competitiveness through 
substantial growth is the task facing the government's economic 
team, headed by Economic Planning Minister Chong Chae-sok. Also 
pressing on the team are price stabilization and industrial 
peace, because without these two industry can hardly compete 
well on the world market.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 11 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
presided over the sixth meeting for promoting "a new economy" on 
Tuesday as a gesture of determination to materialize his vision 
of a viable economy based on deregulation and strong competitive 
edge, commonly called "ynomics." 
  Kim set the direction for economic policy and then listened 
to reports from 11 related agencies, starting with the Science 
and Technology Ministry. 
  The man who pledged to be an "economic president" showed his 
priorities by the order in which he heard the reports from his 
cabinet. 
  His predecessors had called in ministers with security and 
diplomatic portfolios first for their new year reports. In 
contrast, Kim heard from the Economic Planning Board first and 
then listened to reports from each economy-related ministry. 
  On Monday, he had lunch with three former presidents and 
heard about various projects to promote science and technology 
from Yi Sang-hui, chairman of the advisory council on Science 
and Technology. Kim promised to strengthen the country's 
economic competitiveness within his five years in office. 
  Naming expansion of social overhead capital, balanced land 
development, deregulation, science and technology development, 
resolution of regional economic imbalances, and stronger 
competitiveness of rural areas as the main tasks to improve the 
country's economic competitiveness, he said he will personally 
see that they are carried out. 
  Chong Chae-sok, deputy prime minister and Economic Planning 
minister, reported that his team will draw up a comprehensive 
measure to rebuild rural communities to adapt to 
internationalization, radically improve the business environment 
to boost business activities, expand the infrastructure fund and 
create equal regional development, accelerate structural reforms 
and systems to prepare for free global trade, improve living 
standards, stabilize prices, and encourage frugality. 
  Emboldened by the first balance of payments surplus in four 
years, the president is determined to accomplish a second 
economic leap forward for Korea by keeping industrial relations 
at peace and by getting the help of businessmen, workers, public 
servants and farmers, presidential aides say. 
  Peaceful industrial relations and stable pay are most 
important to raise international competitiveness, Kim said in 
the meeting, instructing the ministers to rack their brains for 
ways to cement partnership between labor and management. 
  Designating 1994 the year of economic recovery, Kim was most 
attentive to economic revitalization and to radical science and 
technology development, said Pak Chae-yun, senior presidential 
secretary for economic affairs. 
  He noted that Kim has retired his stock phrase 
"pain-sharing" 
in the new year. 
  He did not call for pain-sharing in the economy meeting, but 
put stress on peaceful industrial relations, stable wages, and 
reforms in economic thinking and systems. 
  He may believe that pain-sharing, in other words a frugality 
campaign, took root last year in the gale of reforms and 
changes, aides say. 
  Or he may have realized that the call for pain-sharing to 
rebuild the country no longer appeals now that a year has passed 
since his administration was born, they say. 
  Kim must have concluded that it was time to implant real 
hope 
and expectations in the people that the economy can be brought 
back to life, they speculate.

  [Text] The government, in a move to help enhance 
competitiveness of local farming products, plans to halve 
production costs of rice by the year 2001 while doubling 
research and development (R&amp;D) outlays for the agricultural 
sector by 1998. 
  These and other policies are contained in a New Year report 
to Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Kim Yang-pae, 
made by Kim Kwang-hui, administrator of the Rural Development 
Administration (RDA) yesterday [10 January]. 
  The RDA administrator said that agriculture-related research 
would be centered on how to strengthen competitiveness of 
farming products, a departure from the traditional emphasis on 
how to increase farming yield. 
  To do so, he said, the administration plans to expand the 
ratio of R&amp;D funds for the farming sector to the nation's 
total 
agricultural production from this year's 0.42 percent or 73.3 
billion won to 0.88 percent or 175.9 billion won in 1998. 
  He also reported that production costs of rice per kilogram 
would be reduced from the current 862 won to 441 won by 2001, 
while rice yield per 10 acres would rise from the present 461kg 
to 510kg by 2001. 
  Production costs of beef per kilogram would decline from the 
current 5,152 won to 3,723 won in seven years, he said. 
  The administration plans to drop production costs of barley 
by 52.7 percent from the present 417 won per kilogram to 197 won 
by 2001 and those of beans and potatoes by 48.6 percent and 63.7 
percent from the present 1,078 won to 554 won and from the 
current 342 won to 124 won, respectively. 
  It also plans to reduce production costs of pork per 
kilogram 
from the current 1,294 won to 924 won by 2001 and those of red 
pepper from the current 3,578 won per kilogram to 1,800 won by 
2001. 
  The RDA also will put priority on the development of 
environment-friendly farming technologies while expanding trial 
farming-products specialization projects by region.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 11 (YONHAP) -- Wage negotiations are 
expected to be completed earlier than in previous years, Korea 
Employers' Association (KEA) Vice Chairman Hwang Chong-hyon 
forecast Tuesday [11 January]. 
  KEA wants to complete its talks with the Federation of 
Korean 
Trade Unions (FKTU) by the middle of February and finish company 
talks before the end of March, Hwang said. 
  "As the government has set this year's goal at strengthening 
international competitiveness of the nation and has a strong 
will to control prices, price hikes will not be so considerable 
a reason for wage increases," he predicted. 
  Economic Planning Minister Chong Chae-sok and Labor Minister 
Nam Chae-hui told FKTU Chairman Pak Chong-kon on Saturday [8 
January] that the government intends to control prices, and Pak 
said FKTU will seek to end its wage negotiations with KEA as 
early as possible if prices are controlled. 
  KEA will draw up wage demands by the middle of this month 
and 
select negotiators to meet with FKTU late this month. 
  "Government, management and labor met in October and agreed 
to change ties between management and labor to autonomous and 
cooperative," an FKTU spokesman said. "Moreover, workers share 
the view that increasing competitiveness is the only way for 
Korea to survive in a competitive international arena." 
  KEA and FKTU agreed on a unified wage hike plan in April for 
the first time.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 7 (YONHAP) -- The National Defense 
Ministry reported on Friday it had established a defense system 
improvement committee to work out ways to improve military arms 
procurement system so as to prevent the recurrence of incidents 
similar to the recent arms procurement scam. 
  Lt. Gen. Chang Song, superintendent of the military academy, 
was named to head the committee, a ministry official said. 
  The committee, to go into operation on Jan. 10, will have 
two 
subcommittees -- one on the improvement of the Yulgok project 
and the other on the improvement of military supply procurement 
system. 
  The former will be chaired by Maj. Gen. Kil Hyong-bo and the 
latter by Brig. Gen. Yu Song-u. 
  Defense Minister Yi Byong-tae, naming Lt. Gen. Chang as 
committee chairman, told him to oversee committee business on a 
full-time basis, leaving military academy duties to the cadet 
corps commander, the official said. 
  The committee will be operated through the end of February 
and its membership number 15 -- eight for the Yulgok project 
subcommittee and seven for the supply procurement one. 
  Members have been picked up from among logistics experts at 
the ministry, Joint Chiefs of Staff, tri-service headquarters 
and defense institutes, the official added.

has virtually made a decision on the procurement of the aircraft 
for the 500 billion won [$625 million] electronic warfare 
aircraft project (Kumgang Parktu Project). Production is 
expected to be suspended in 1994 and suspicion has been raised 
within the military of possible mishandling of the project. 
  The JCS held a meeting of the Arms Systems Deliberation 
Committee on 30 December last year and decided on three types of 
aircraft as the final ones for negotiation after three years of 
pondering. The three types of aircraft are: one large 
aircraft, the French Dassault Falcon 50; and two medium-size 
aircraft, BAE-125 built by U.S. Raytheon and Citation III built 
by U.S. Cessna. 
  However, since the two medium-size aircraft fall short of 
the 
performance necessary for military operations required by the 
user unit, such as payload capacity and duration of flight, the 
procurement of Falcon 50 has virtually been decided. 
  The Falcon 50 the JCS has decided to procure has never been 
developed for military use and its production is supposed to be 
suspended this year. Moreover, the large Canadian Challenger 
jet, which has been developed for military use, has been dropped 
from the list of aircraft to be negotiated on, arousing doubt 
within the military about the decisionmaking process. The 
Defense Security Command, therefore, is reported to have 
undertaken an investigation of the case. 
  The electronic warfare aircraft project is supposed to 
procure eight reconnaissance planes from 1996 through 1999 so as 
to take over the role of the reconnaissance unit of the U.S. 
forces in the ROK which will be withdrawing toward the end of 
the nineties. 
  According to Defense Ministry and JCS officials, the JCS 
excluded the Canadaire Challenger--which had already been 
developed and in use for intelligence purposes in 1989 when the 
JCS began to push ahead with the project--from the prospective 
list of procurement from the outset. Instead, the JCS included 
in the list only the Falcon 50, and the two medium-size aircraft 
which are incapable of competition as they fall short of the 
performance required for military operations. 
  In response to the decision, the Canadian Government sent a 
letter through the Canadian Embassy in Seoul in 1991 to then 
Defense Minister Choe Se-chang protesting the exclusion of the 
Challenger, which was the only model in the world developed for 
military reconnaissance purposes [as published] and was used in 
the Gulf war. Minister Choe ordered Vice Minister Kwon Yong-hae 
to include the Challenger and make a new presentation. 
  The Defense Ministry and JCS officials, however, said the 
JCS 
disregarded the order for nearly three years and suddenly held 
the Arms Systems Deliberation Committee meeting at the end of 
last year, right after former Minister Kwon was replaced, and 
decided to negotiate on the Falcon 50 and two medium-size 
models, excluding the Challenger again. The officials said that 
because of the decision, the Falcon is almost certain to be 
selected as the final model beating the medium-size models. 
  According to the officials, before the Arms Systems 
Deliberation Committee meeting was held in early December 1993, 
the working-level meeting of the project had notified the 
deliberation committee members of its conclusion that the 
medium-size models were not appropriate and that the Challenger 
should be selected. 
  The officials said that it was suspected from the beginning 
that the decision makers wanted to select Falcon 50 by including 
in the list Falcon 50 and the two medium-size models and 
excluding the Challenger, because a large-size reconnaissance 
aircraft was the one they needed. 
  A high-ranking JCS official said, "The Arms Systems 
Deliberation Committee made the decision by vote of its members 
on the judgment that the performance comparison presented by the 
user unit was right.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 10 (YONHAP) -- The government plans to 
form a section, or a bureau, in the Economic Planning Board 
(EPB) to take charge of budgeting for the Yulgok military 
buildup program. 
  The plan is part of moves by the government to practically 
screen each and every military project before it decides the 
defense budget, EPB officials said Monday. 
  The decision was apparently prompted by suspected 
irregularities in the Yulgok project and a recent artillery 
ammunition scandal. Public criticisms have been rising against 
the misuses of taxpayers' money under the pretext of military 
buildup. 
  In the past, the Defense Ministry asked for an annual budget 
for the Yulgok projects without specifying in detail where it 
was going to use the money. Because of the nature of the 
projects, the military has maintained that they had to be kept 
in secret. 
  From now on, however, all Yulgok projects are to be subject 
to screening by budget compilers at the EPB, who will check the 
need and soundness of each project. The Yulgok projects had 
accounted for 30 percent to 40 percent of the total defense 
spending every year. 
  The Yulgok project, which was launched by President Pak 
Chong-hui in 1974, had spent a total of 30 trillion won. Last 
year's budget for the project amounted to 2.9 trillion won, or 
31.6 percent of the entire national defense budget. 
  There are 148 projects, including the purchase of the Air 
Force's next generation fighter plane and new tanks for the Army 
and destroyers and submarines for the Navy.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 10 (YONHAP) -- Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae told the Defense System Improvement Committee on 
Monday that the Yulgok force improvement plan must be carried 
out in the right way if it is to deter war. 
  Some 130 of the 300-odd projects under the Yulgok plan ought 
to be reexamined to decide whether they should be continued, he 
said. 
  He told the 18-member committee, chaired by Lt. Gen. Chang 
Song, commandant of the Korea Military Academy, that it must 
find ways to improve Yulgok projects and the defense procurement 
system as well as to restore the people's trust in the military. 
  Also Monday, Lt. Gen. Chang Pyong-yong, head of the Armed 
Forces Special Inspection Group, said that a special team would 
start a full-scope probe of two of the five Yulgok projects it 
is to investigate toward the end of the week. 
  The two are relocation of the Army's combat arms school and 
the Navy's procurement of tactical data systems. 
  Cho Ki-hyon, 53, president of Chongwoo Construction Co., 
will 
be questioned about his company's role in the relocation 
project, Chang told reporters. 
  He said an exit ban on So Chon-sok, 52, president of Litton 
Korea, has been lifted as he was found to have had nothing to do 
with the Navy's tactical data system project. 
  The team will focus on what was overlooked or missed in the 
Board of Audit and Inspection's probe last year, he said.

  [Text] Six delegations of the United State Congress and 
large American companies are expected in Vietnam during the 
first two weeks of January. Currently, a delegation of the U.S. 
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Commission [as heard] is in 
Hanoi. Here is our radio editor's opinion: 
  From now to the middle of January, five United States 
delegations will come to Vietnam. They will represent large 
United States companies such as IBM and General Motors, and 
include the delegation of the Defense Subcommittee of the United 
States Senate, a delegation of the Asia-Pacific Subcommittee of 
the U.S. House of Representatives led by Russell Wilson, a 
delegation under Senator John Kerry, and a delegation led by 
Admiral Charles Larson, commander-in-chief of the U.S. 
Asia-Pacific command. 
  According to Western news agencies, the delegations will 
visit Vietnam to find out possibilities of cooperation and for a 
precise assessment of the renovation process in Vietnam. 
Through their visits, they expect to make a recommendation to 
President Clinton to remove the 20-year-long economic embargo 
against Vietnam. 
  United States Senator Bennett Johnston, head of a delegation 
from the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Commission, 
last Saturday [8 January] called on the United States President 
to remove the embargo. He said in Hanoi that it was time to 
close the door on the past and move toward normalizing of 
relations and cooperation. Speaking to a REUTERS correspondent 
in Hanoi, he hoped the U.S. President would quickly remove the 
sanction against Vietnam. 
  Senator Don Nickles, a Republican Party member of the same 
delegation, also said he wants the United States President to 
lift the embargo. 
  The voice of the United States politicians demanding the 
lifting of the embargo will become stronger in 1994. The 
American delegations to visit Vietnam in the coming days will 
surely have the same voice as the delegation of Senator Johnston. 
  It is an issue President Clinton has to consider and solve.

<F P=106> [National Assembly's resolution on the practice of thrift </F>
and efforts to oppose waste, corruption, and smuggling adopted 
by the Ninth National Assembly's Fourth Session in Hanoi on 30 
December 1993] 
  [Text] I. On the recommendation of the government, the 
Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's Organ of 
Control; and based on the Nationalities Council's investigative 
report, the National Assembly Committees' viewpoints, and the 
ideas of voters nationwide on the struggle against corruption, 
smuggling, and waste, the National Assembly noted the following: 
These social vices have developed to a serious degree, thereby 
corrupting a segment of cadres and state personnel, adversely 
effecting social order and safety, creating indignation among 
the public, and diminishing the people's confidence in our 
regime. [passage omitted] 
  II. The government must fully exercise its authority and 
function as prescribed by the law. It must formulate the 
concrete lines and key measures to: 
  1. Amend, supplement, and promulgate lines and policies on 
improving the management mechanism to suit the reality, 
enhancing the effectiveness of state management work and helping 
weak establishments to overcome waste, setbacks in production, 
and damage to the people's interests. 
  In amending policies, improving the management mechanism, 
and 
strengthening the implementation of tasks, special attention 
must be paid to areas that encourage corruption and waste 
causing great losses to state property. These include such 
areas as capital construction, land and house management, budget 
allotment, taxes and customs, banking, export-import, and 
project examination. Efforts must be made to promulgate rules 
and regulations to step by step eliminate the system of 
management by ministries and the administration as well as 
prejudice between central and local enterprises. Efforts must 
also be made to strengthen state management function at 
production and business establishments; rearrange business 
activities at state-run agencies, mass organizations and 
societies; and supplement and perfect expenditure regulations 
for state-run enterprises and mass organizations and societies 
in line with the reality, while promoting saving and motivating 
the people to practise thrift, especially during the Lunar New 
Year celebrations. 
  2. Efforts must be made to perfect the organization of state 
agencies, train a contingent of competent cadres, and expel from 
state apparatuses various degenerate elements who are involved 
in corruption and smuggling. We must take due action against 
heads of agencies and units who ignore law violations in their 
areas of responsibility. We must strengthen and perfect the 
measures against corruption and smuggling from the central to 
local levels, purify the contingent of cadres, and assign 
capable and prestigious cadres to agencies to enhance their 
efficacy. 
  3. We must provide close guidance and strengthen the control 
and investigation work at various state-run agencies and 
enterprises to promptly detect and stop such practices as 
influencing authority, embezzlement, extortion, corruption, 
smuggling, helping smugglers, misappropriation of public funds, 
wastage, and causing losses to state property and the people's 
interest. 
  Those who violate the law in the ways previously mentioned 
will be seriously dealt with in accordance with the law, 
regardless of their authority and position. Those who are found 
guilty must pay a full compensation to the public fund or to the 
persons concerned. Drastic measures must be taken against those 
who provide protection for criminals, or those who used their 
authority to settle cases of violation in their organization 
when the evidence was sufficient for a court trial. Measures 
must be taken to protect those who detect and denounce illegal 
acts. 
  4. Efforts must be made to formulate concrete plans to guide 
and supervise various sectors and echelons to effectively carry 
out this resolution. 
  III. The Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Organ 
of Control, and various government law enforcement agencies must 
carry out the following tasks: 
  1. Perfect the organization and training of cadres so as to 
make them genuinely strong and capable, expel degenerated 
elements from law enforcement agencies, and enhance the quality 
and capability of cadres and state personnel; 
  2. Closely coordinate with other agencies to strengthen law 
enforcement work, promptly detect and deal severely with crimes 
and criminals, especially serious cases that cause great loss to 
the state and people's property, including the pending cases. 
  IV. The National Assembly's Standing Committee must 
strengthen its supervision in the promulgation of essential 
decrees and resolutions. It is imperative for the National 
Assembly to promulgate the resolution on coordination procedures 
between state agencies in order to organize the movement to 
promote thrift and oppose waste, corruption, and smuggling. 
  The Nationalities Council and other National Assembly 
Committees must formulate plans to implement resolutions in 
accordance with their functions and duties as prescribed by the 
law. 
  National Assembly delegations and deputies, the People's 
Councils, and People's Councillors at various echelons must 
exercise their function and duty of supervising various state 
agencies at the central level and in the provinces to 
satisfactorily implement this resolution. National Assembly 
deputies and the echelons of People's Councils must set a good 
example in carrying out their tasks and activities. 
  V. The National Assembly requests the Vietnam Fatherland 
Front, mass organizations and societies to motivate the people 
to develop their master role, promote thrift, and oppose 
corruption and smuggling. They must participate in and 
supervise the movement to oppose violation of the law while 
heightening vigilance to foil the enemy's schemes and tactics 
against this movement. Various mass media agencies must 
satisfactorily carry out the propaganda work, commend good deeds 
and denounce negative practices, contribute to detecting acts of 
law violation, train a contingent of competent journalists, and 
present accurate news and information. 
  The National Assembly charged the Prime Minister, the Chief 
Judge of the Supreme People's Court, and the Chief Procurator of 
the Supreme People's Organ of Control with the task of 
organizing the implementation of this resolution. Efforts must 
be made to launch a campaign to promote thrift and oppose waste, 
corruption, and smuggling among the people in society. 
Periodical reports must be filed to the National Assembly's 
Standing Committee on the results of the implementation of this 
resolution. [passage omitted] 
  This resolution was adopted by the SRV Ninth National 
Assembly's Fourth Session on 30 December 1993. 
  [Signed] National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh

<F P=106> ["Invincible Vitality of Line of Building Self-Supporting </F>
National Economy"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 11 (KCNA) -- Socialist 
construction is being stepped up and the advantages of 
Korean-style socialism are highly displayed in Korea in face of 
the malevolent maneouvrings of the imperialists and the 
worldwide economic fluctuation. It is because the Korean people 
have creditably built the self-supporting national economy, says 
NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined article today. 
  The article says: 
  The line of building a self-supporting national economy is 
fully displaying its great material strength, great validity and 
tremendous vitality in our country. 
  The invincible vitality of the Workers' Party of Korea's 
line of building a self-supporting national economy lies, above 
all, in that it helps maintain the political independence of the 
country in any circumstances. 
  Economic self-sustenance is just the way of maintaining 
political independence, the life and soul of an independent 
sovereign state. The Korean people are always firmly maintaining 
the political independence of the country by building the 
self-supporting national economy under the wise guidance of the 
party and the leader. 
  Thanks to the powerful self-supporting economy the Korean 
people are now creditably defending the dignity and sovereignty 
of the nation in confrontation with the U.S.-led imperialists 
even under the situation where socialism has suffered setbacks 
in some countries of the world. 
  Its invincible vitality of our party's line also lies in 
that 
it makes it possible to steadily strengthen the material and 
technical foundations of the country and accelerate the 
socialist construction at a high speed. 
  The self-supporting economy of Korea is on a very high level 
in the modernization of its technical equipment and in the 
building of departmental structures and turns out everything 
necessary for economic construction and people's living. 
  The powerful self-supporting economy helps the party and the 
people of Korea to develop the economy at a high tempo on the 
basis of their own economic foundations in any circumstances. 
  An industrial output increased by 50 percent and its average 
annual growth rate was 5.6 percent in the period of the third 
seven- year plan, which clearly shows how the self- supporting 
economy of Korea maintains a steady and high- speed of growth. 
  The invincible vitality of the line finds its manifestation 
in that it makes it possible to steadily improve the material 
and cultural living standard of people and highly display the 
advantages of socialism. 
  Having a powerful self-supporting economy the party and the 
state can provide the entire people with a happy life. 
  With the progress of economic construction the people's real 
income steadily increases and the party and the state are 
pursuing better policies for the improvement of people's living. 
  All this shows the great superiority of Korean-style 
socialism to capitalist society and a proud fruition of the 
self-supporting national economy.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 8 (KCNA) -- The revolutionary 
economic strategy of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] is an 
absolutely correct policy of economic construction based on a 
scientific penetration into the actual conditions of the 
development of the national economy of Korea, the lawful 
requirements of the economic development of socialism and the 
changing domestic and international situation. 
  Dr. Chong Kwan-yong says this in an article contributed to 
NODONG SINMUN today. 
  He explains the reasons why the revolutionary economic 
strategy of the WPK is correct as follows: 
  The first reason is that the strategy makes it possible to 
radically improve the people's standard of living in a few years 
to come and bring the advantages and vitality of Korean-style 
socialism into fuller play. 
  To this end, state investment in agriculture, the light 
industry, foreign trade and other sectors related to the 
people's living will be increased and the nation's fund, 
materials and equipment be directed first of all to the 
development of agriculture and the increase of the production of 
consumer goods and export products. 
  Today when the heavy industry has a solid foundation, the 
agriculture-first, light industry-first and foreign trade-first 
policy is a firm guarantee for steadily consolidating and 
expanding the nation's economic foundation as a whole and 
improving the people's standard of living. 
  The revolutionary economic strategy of the WPK is a popular 
one because it indicates the road of rapidly developing all 
sectors of the national economy which are complicatedly 
interlinked by placing the desires and interests of the people 
in the centre and finding the master key in that direction. 
  Another reason is that the strategy makes it possible to 
consolidate the self-reliant foundation of the economy so that 
we may live on our own strength under the new, changed situation; 
  It is the invariable principle of the WPK that we live on 
our 
own strength, firmly defending the honor and dignity of 
socialism under any circumstances. We must make full material 
preparations to live on our own strength if we are to defend and 
accomplish the cause of socialism in face of the vicious 
offensive of the allied forces of imperialism aimed at 
isolating, blockading and stifling the DPRK. 
  The strategy makes it possible to continuously develop the 
coal and power industries, rail transport and the metal industry 
while concentrating on agriculture, the light industry and 
export products. Thus it will strengthen the chuche orientation 
and self- reliance of our economy and firmly ensure that our 
people live on their own strength under any circumstances. 
  Another reason is that the strategy makes it possible to 
secure a new base for reaching higher levels of socialism. 
  It is very timely and correct for our party to have set the 
three years to come as a period of adjustment. And the policy 
of concentrating on agriculture, the light industry and foreign 
trade is so wise that we can secure a new base for higher levels. 
  The strategy is, indeed, patent proof of the wise guidance 
of 
the great leader President Kim Il-song and the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il who victoriously lead the building of the 
economy, turning adversity into a favorable condition and 
misfortune into a blessing with their rare wisdom and 
clairvoyant scientific insight.

  [Text] Functionaries and workers in the building materials 
industry sector greeted the 30th anniversary of the Building 
Materials Day today, at a time when all the people throughout 
the country are accelerating this year's rewarding march of 
advance with revolutionary optimism and faith. Greeting the 
significant day, functionaries and workers in the building 
materials industry sector are filled with the burning 
determination to produce more building materials and to supply 
them to socialist construction projects at their work sites, 
which have been built into chuche-oriented and self-reliant 
building materials bases that firmly rely on their own affluent 
raw materials and fuel. 
  Reporter Yi Hak-sil, of the Central Broadcasting Station, 
met 
with Chang Tae-pong, vice minister of the Building Materials 
Industry Ministry, and Han Song-chon, deputy director of a 
bureau of the ministry. 
  [Begin recording] [Yi Hak-sil] I congratulate you on the 
Building Materials Day. 
  [Chang Tae-pong] Thank you. I feel deep emotion in greeting 
this significant day. Thirty years ago, on 8 January 1964, the 
great leader convened a consultative meeting of functionaries in 
the building materials industry sector and made there a historic 
speech entitled "On some measures to develop building materials 
industry." The great leader's historic speech at the meeting was 
a programmatic guideline in founding and developing a 
self-reliant, modern, and our own style building materials 
industry. This is why our functionaries and workers in our 
building materials industry sector have significantly celebrated 
8 January every year as the Building Materials Day to 
commemorate forever the day which opened an epochal turning 
point in developing the building materials industry of the 
country. 
  [Yi] We can say that our building materials industry has 
traversed the road of rapid development thanks to the great 
leader's wise leadership and the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il's energetic guidance. What do you say? 
  [Han Song-chon] That is right. The great leader took epochal 
measures for developing the building materials industry right 
after the national liberation and since then he has wisely lead 
on to build building materials production bases throughout the 
country. 
  Our building materials industry today has greeted a new 
heyday in its development thanks to the tested leadership and 
energetic guidance of the dear comrade leader who is upholding 
the great leader's lofty intent. We can say with great dignity 
and confidence that large-scale cement plants and many building 
materials production bases have been built throughout the 
country thanks to the wise leadership and great consideration of 
the great leader and the dear comrade leader. 
  We will also further plan and coordinate organizational and 
political work and production guidance so that all work sites 
that have been built into self-reliant and modern building 
materials production bases, which can outstandingly guarantee 
any large-scale construction projects, can produce more building 
materials. Thus, we will further enhance the popular 
masses-centered socialism of our own style through the success 
of more building materials production. [end recording]

achieved a remarkable progress in iron and steel production. 
  The state defined this sector as one of the main domains on 
which efforts should be concentrated in economic construction 
from the beginning of the year and increased investment in the 
metal industry. 
  Continuous roughing processes were newly built in the 
Chollima steel complex and the Hwanghae iron and steel complex, 
and the ferro-alloy workshop of the Puryong ferro-alloy complex 
was reconstructed on an expansion basis. 
  As a results, the production of steel and pig iron increased 
27 percent, and that of rolled steel 33 percent last year 
compared with the previous year, taking the Ministry of Metal 
Industry as a whole. 
  The Kim Chaek iron and steel complex, a leading iron 
production base, kept production on a high level by introducing 
many valuable technical innovation proposals. 
  At the Hwanghae iron and steel complex technical control of 
the metallurgical equipment was improved and advanced work 
methods were introduced to markedly increase iron and steel 
production while reducing fuel consumption. 
  Ferro-alloy production last year increased 55 percent above 
the previous year at the Puryong ferro-alloy complex.

<F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 8 January editorial: "Let Us Accelerate New </F>
Year's March by Upholding the Banner of Single-hearted Unity"] 
  [Text] Today, the whole country is seething with upsurged 
revolutionary enthusiasm of the party members and working people 
who turn out in the New Year's march by upholding the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year's address. 
  Defending the might of our single-hearted unity around the 
party and the leader like the apples of our eyes and further 
displaying it are decisive factors guaranteeing triumphs for 
this year's march. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: We should 
defend the revolutionary ranks' single-hearted unity, which has 
been consolidated under the leadership of our party, like the 
apples of our eyes, and further develop and consolidate it. 
  Single-hearted unity is a immortal tradition of glory and a 
immortal banner of victory. Our people have strived heroically 
by closely rallying around the party and the leader. As a 
result, they have triumphantly overcome countless difficulties 
and trials lying in the way of the revolution and set up a 
strong socialist country of self-dependence, self-support, and 
self-reliant defense on this land. 
  Last year, in which the fatherland and revolution were faced 
with a stern trial, our people proudly defended sovereignty and 
security of the socialist fatherland and achieved a big success 
in socialist economic construction thanks to the might of 
single-hearted unity. 
  We should ardently adhere to the tradition of glorious 
single- hearted unity and further bring full play to the might 
of it so as to fully display the superiority of the socialism of 
our own style and complete the socialist cause of chuche to the 
end in any storm. Firmly consolidating single-hearted unity 
among our revolutionary ranks is an important requirement for 
the environment of our revolution and enormous tasks arising 
before us. 
  The imperialists and reactionaries are intensifying an 
unprecedented offensive in political, economic, military, 
diplomatic, and all other spheres to isolate, stifle, and crush 
[korip, chilsik, apsal] the Republic which is advancing under 
the banner of socialism. Due to the enemies' anti-Republic and 
antisocialist maneuvers, the situation in our country became 
extremely tense and complicated, and countless obstacles were 
laid before us. Under such conditions, we should uphold the 
banner of single-hearted unity higher in order to effect a 
revolutionary upsurge in socialist construction by waging a 
movement to carry out the revolutionary economic strategy of our 
party. 
  Our single-hearted unity is unity of ideology and action of 
the whole party and the entire people who follow the great 
leader [suryong] and the illustrious leader [yongdoja] with 
unquestioned worship. 
  There are no obstacles nor fortresses that we cannot 
overcome 
or occupy when we march by upholding the might of great 
single-hearted unity that is unprecedented in history. The road 
to smashing every step of vicious anti-Republic and 
antisocialist maneuvers of the imperialists and reactionaries 
and bringing full play to the spirit of the chuche Korea lie in 
displaying the might of single-hearted unity. In addition, the 
road to consolidating the foundations of the nation's 
independent economy rock-solid by vigorously accelerating the 
general onward march of socialism lies in the fact that all the 
people unite single-heartedly around the party. 
  The ideology on all the more strengthening the single- 
hearted unity of our revolutionary ranks which was elucidated in 
the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year address, is a 
precious guideline which provided a decisive guarantee in the 
victory of this year's battle. Here lies the great leader's 
lofty will of trying to bring about a historical turning point 
in our country's revolution and construction this year by all 
the more highly manifesting the might of our single-hearted 
unity of the entire party, all the people, and the entire Army 
solidly uniting around the great leader [yongdoja]. 
  All the party members and workers must all the more 
consolidate and develop our single-hearted unity in accordance 
with the prevailing situation and the demand of the 
revolutionary development to brilliantly realize the militant 
task presented in the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New 
Year address and achieve greater victories in the struggle to 
advance the cause of socialism of our own style. 
  Most of all, all the party members and workers must have a 
deep understanding of the leader's [yongdoja] greatness. Also, 
it is important for them to have a clear faith of absolutely 
having faith in and following their leader [suryong] and their 
leader [yongdoja] in whatever kind of environment. 
  The might of unity of the revolutionary ranks is the firm 
might of faith of all the people toward the leader [yongdoja]. 
Our dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a peerless great man 
who is combined with both literary and military accomplishments 
as well as loyalty and filial piety. He is also the fate and 
future of our fatherland, nation, and socialism of our own style. 
  All the party members and workers must experience in their 
hearts of how we are upholding such a great leader [yongdoja] at 
the head of the party, the revolutionary ranks, and the people's 
Armed Forces through our revolutionary's proud reality which is 
advancing without the slightest wavering amid the world's 
disturbances. 
  We must always deeply bear in our hearts the rock-firm faith 
that the fatherland exists because of the leader [yongdoja] and 
that our happiness and the prosperity of the posterity is 
guaranteed, and uphold the dear comrade leader with 
single-hearted loyalty and filial piety. 
  Comrade Yi In-mo is a magnificent example in absolutely 
admiring and following the dear comrade leader who is the center 
of unity of our revolution and the center of leadership. As 
concentratedly reflected in the poem dedicated to the dear 
comrade leader filled with the single-hearted unity of loyalty, 
Comrade Yi In-mo's ideological and spiritual world is truly a 
lofty spiritual world which can be possessed only by a true 
revolutionary who shares the fate with the leader [yongdoja] to 
the end in whatever hardships. 
  All the party members and workers must reflect themselves in 
the spiritual world of Comrade Yi In-mo and must endlessly 
cultivate themselves to become genuine loyalists. 
  The great chuche idea is the ideological basis of our 
single- 
hearted unity. All the people are firmly guaranteeing the 
consistency of ideology and behavior according to the demand of 
the chuche idea. Here lies the invincible might of our 
single-hearted unity. 
  The party members and workers must deeply bear in their 
minds 
that the chuche idea is the life of socialism of our own style 
and must all the more firmly arm themselves with the chuche 
idea. In particular, the work to deeply study the great 
leader's classic works and the dear comrade leader's documents 
which completely compiles the chuche idea, theory, and method 
must be carried out steadily. 
  We must deeply study the great leader's New Year address of 
this year by analyzing it in detail and firmly arm ourselves 
with its profound ideology. Along with this, we must continue 
to energetically study the dear comrade leader's immortal works 
including, "Interference in Socialism Cannot Be Tolerated," and 
"The Historical Lesson in Socialist Construction and Our Party's 
General Line," so that we can all the more firmly consolidate 
the faith that we will always win as long as the great leader 
[yongdoja] exists who is leading our revolution toward the one 
road of chuche. 
  Our single-hearted unity is a strong driving force of the 
socialist construction and its might must be wholly manifested 
in the practical struggle to accelerate socialist economic 
construction. In accordance with the changing environment and 
the actual demand of our country's socialist construction, our 
party today presented the method on moving toward the road of 
agriculture first, light industry first, and trade first and is 
calling the whole party and all the people to fulfill it. 
  We must consolidate like bedrock the country's independent 
economic basis, all the more enhance the people's living 
standard, and wholly display the might of unity of our people 
which is firmly united around the party and the leader in 
today's worthwhile struggle to occupy a new offensive camp for 
the domination of a higher ground in socialism. 
  All the party members and workers must highly manifest 
endless devotion and the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance 
and fortitude toward the party and the revolution so that the 
plan of the people's economy which they are entrusted with can 
be accomplished at an appropriate time and without fail. 
  When the party members and workers of all sectors of the 
people's economy exert strenuous efforts by highly upholding the 
party's intention to help and lead each other and highly 
manifest the popular heroism, we can magnificently fulfill any 
kind of task we are faced with this year. 
  To elucidate socialism of our own style through the might of 
single-hearted unity, the communist virtue which is overflowing 
in all of the society must all the more be fully blossomed. Our 
people's revolutionary trait which is single-heartedly united 
around the party and the leader must be vigorously displayed in 
highly manifesting the communist virtue of all the members of 
society helping and leading each other according to the 
collective principle of one for all and all for one. 
  We must substantially carry out the work to establish a 
revolutionary outlook on life, and persistently carry out the 
work well to learn the beautiful ideological, spiritual, and 
moral traits of the pioneers of the communist virtue so that 
laudable communist acts can be highly manifested. In 
particular, we must all the more fully blossom the virtue of 
Army-people unity which has been highly manifested traditionally. 
  All the party members and workers must not forget even a 
second that we are living and struggling with the strong 
willpower and optimism because of the People's Army led by our 
comrade supreme commander. Therefore, they must assist the 
People's Army from the bottom of their hearts and love the 
People's Army as if it is their own flesh and blood. By doing 
so, work must be carried out to all the more loudly resound the 
shouts of hurrah of the ideology of Army-people unity anywhere. 
  The party organizations and functionaries are possessed of 
an 
important duty in further firmly consolidating our 
single-hearted unity and highly manifesting its might. The 
party organizations must adhere to and elucidate the tradition 
of single-hearted unity. This must be put forth as a [words 
indistinct] work related to the fate of socialism of our own 
style and must yield everything to it. 
  The party organizations must consistently carry out all work 
so that it can all the more firmly consolidate our 
single-hearted unity. In particular, priority must be put into 
thoroughly embodying the politics of benevolence presented by 
the dear comrade leader who endlessly loves the people. 
  Our functionaries are the core force of the party and 
faithful servants of the people. The role of the functionaries 
is importantly dependent on how great our party's politics of 
love and politics of faith toward the people is actually brought 
about. All the functionaries must uphold the party's slogan of, 
"Serving the People," and must sincerely work as a messenger of 
the people and take pains so that the party's benefits and 
considerations can be all the more extended to the people well. 
  All the guiding functionaries must substantially and 
persistently carry out the revolutionization and working 
classification work of themselves so that the revolutionary and 
people-oriented work method and work style can be all the more 
embodied. This is to make all the guiding functionaries into 
genuine functionaries and true messenger of the people in which 
the masses truly respect and follow. 
  The single-hearted unity is our most mighty weapon and 
strength to advocate, adhere to, and complete socialism of our 
own style to the end. As long as there is the wise leadership 
of the party and the leader, and the single-hearted unity united 
like bedrock around the great leader [suryong] and the great 
leader [yongdoja], there is nothing to be afraid of in this 
world. 
  Let us all the more move forward by highly upholding the 
banner of single-hearted unity with redoubled courage and 
unshakable confidence so that the resolute spirit of the heroic 
Korea can once again be displayed in this year's socialist 
general onward march.

and reactionaries. 
  They wished Comrade Kim Chong-il a long life in good health.

Comrade Kim Chong-il sent a 100th birthday table to Chon 
Ssanggamae, an old woman residing in Sangchang-ri, Hamju County, 
South Hamgyong Province, on January 6. 
  Upon receiving the birthday table amid blessings of all 
people that day, the old woman and her family, relatives and 
villagers expressed boundless thanks and reverence for the dear 
leader who bestowed deep benevolence on her, caring for the 
birthday of an unknown old woman who has lived an ordinary life. 
  Born into a poor peasant family in a mountainous village in 
Changjin County, South Hamgyong Province, on January 6, 1894, 
she managed to eke out a living by doing farming. She could not 
learn abc, without her proper full name. It was not until Korea 
was liberated in 1945 that she could live a worthy and happy 
life as master of the country. 
  The number of people who enjoy longevity is on a steady 
increase thanks to the popular health policy in the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 9 (KCNA) -- Independence, peace 
and friendship is the consistent foreign policy of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea, stresses NODONG SINMUN in 
an article today. 
  The author of the article says: 
  The great leader President Kim Il-song in his New Year 
address declared that the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] and the 
DPRK Government would consistently adhere to the foreign policy 
of independence, peace and friendship to meet the requirements 
of the present situation. 
  This year, too, the WPK and the DPRK Government will 
consistently adhere to the foreign policy of independence, peace 
and friendship. 
  The DPRK is a dignified country that regards independence as 
its life and soul. 
  To maintain independence is an invariable position and 
policy 
of the DPRK. The DPRK deems it the basic principle of its 
activity to think and judge all things independently, act in 
accordance with its faith and solve all problems in a 
self-determined manner. 
  The idea of independence in the foreign policy is based on 
the chuche idea, the guiding idea of the DPRK. 
  We never allow others to infringe on our sovereignty, 
interfere in our internal affairs and dominate and control us. 
We also object to violating other country's sovereignty. 
  We will judge and deal with all problems in the 
international 
life with independence as the yardstick and fight on against 
infringement on independence. 
  To avert war and preserve peace is a very urgent problem to 
the Korean people. 
  Out of the sense of obligation to preserve peace in our 
times, we will actively fight to terminate the tension and 
military confrontation on the Korean peninsula, denuclearize 
this part of the world, check and foil the acts of aggression 
and war on the part of the imperialists and reactionaries and 
safeguard peace in Asia and the world. 
  Our people value friendship with the world's people. 
  On the principle of independence we will make positive 
efforts to unite and cooperate with the socialist and nonaligned 
countries and develop good-neighborly and friendly relations 
with the capitalist countries which respect the sovereignty of 
our country.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 9 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
carries a by-lined article titled "Advancing Towards Socialism 
is Tide of History." 
  It quotes the great leader President Kim Il-song as saying 
in 
his New Year address that now in the international arena the 
imperialists are vaunting the "end" of socialism, but they 
cannot arrest the people's aspiration to independence, 
sovereignty and socialism, nor can they reverse the tide of 
history. 
  The article says: 
  Though the imperialists and the reactionaries are leaving no 
stone unturned in their attempt to stifle socialism, they can 
never put down the people's aspiration to socialism and reverse 
the tide of history. 
  Describing the frustration of socialism in some countries as 
a change in the tide of history is nothing but an anti- popular, 
unscientific sophism ignoring the social nature of man and the 
law governing the development of history. 
  As long as the popular masses remain the makers of history 
and mankind exists, socialism will surely advance and emerge 
victorious. This is well illustrated by the fact that the 
anti-socialist moves of the imperialists are now on the brink of 
total bankruptcy and the struggle of the popular masses for 
rebuilding socialism and vigorously advancing it is ever growing. 
  That advancing towards socialism is the main trend of our 
time is also proven by the fact that the contradiction and 
crisis of the imperialists are becoming all the more serious and 
the people's struggle for independence is growing worldwide. 
  In the past the imperialist powers joined hands with each 
other against socialism. Now, however, they are locked in a 
fierce fight with each other to expand their sphere of influence 
and capture markets by interfering in different regional 
disputes. 
  It is a stark fact that the imperialists' contradiction and 
crisis are growing more acute and imperialism is rushing 
headlong to its destruction, finding itself on the deathbed in 
face of the people's struggle for building a new independent 
world. 
  Socialism has definitely turned into the demand of our age. 
It is well illustrated also by the fact that the Pyongyang 
declaration calling for defending and advancing the cause of 
socialism has spread rapidly worldwide with a never diminishing 
attraction. The declaration has been signed by 200 political 
parties. This clearly proves its significance and vitality. 
  There is no shadow of doubt that when the revolutionary 
parties and peoples across the world are closely united with 
each other under the banner of independence and powerful makers 
of history for a new world are prepared, the human cause of 
independence, the cause of socialism, will win a final victory.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 8 (KCNA) -- The Japanese 
Government must, though belatedly, admit to Japan's 
responsibility for the crime in drafting "comfort women for the 
Army" in view of the international law, enact a domestic law of 
its own accord and hold trials to bring criminal charges against 
those responsible for the criminal case and manifest its 
intention to restore the damaged honour of the victims and 
international justice, says NODONG SINMUN today in a by-lined 
article. 
  The Japanese Government authorities' act of avoiding full 
investigation into the crime in drafting "comfort women for the 
Army" and publication of its results is to duck their 
responsibility for the anti-human arch crime under the 
international law, the article says, and goes on: 
  The crime in drafting "comfort women for the Army" committed 
by the Japanese imperialists is the most despicable and 
diabolic, inhumane criminal act ever known in human history. It 
is typical of the "crime against humanity" under the 
international law. 
  Because it is, above all, a grave human rights abuse, in the 
form of enslavement of women. 
  It falls under the "crime against humanity" according to 
Subparagraph C of Paragraph 6 of the regulations of the 
Nuremberg International Military Tribunal and Article 5 of the 
Regulations of the Tokyo International Far Eastern Military 
Tribunal. 
  The crime in drafting "comfort women for the Army" committed 
by the Japanese Government and military was a forcible sexual 
enslavement of women. 
  They deprived the "comfort women" of all their freedom and 
rights, treated and murdered them like slaves. 
  This criminal case comes under the "crime against humanity" 
also because it was committed as part of their scheme to 
obliterate another nation. 
  The "imperial Army's" brutal cruelties against the "comfort 
women for the Army" were praised as "qualities" of the "imperial 
Army" because they were based on Japan's policy aimed at 
obliterating the Korean nation itself. 
  This notwithstanding, the Japanese authorities are trying by 
hook or by crook to avoid their responsibility for the criminal 
case under the international law. They describe the publication 
of "Results of Two Rounds of Investigation" as a fulfilment of 
their duty and are intending to evade compensation with an offer 
of something like "fund". 
  If the Japanese Government continually refuse to admit their 
responsibility for the criminal case under the international 
law, to probe the truth and make compensations, it will bump 
into stronger condemnations from the international community.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Ugly Pro-U.S., Pro-Japan Flunkyist </F>
Nation-Seller"] 
  [Text] Puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam is a vicious pro-U.S. 
flunky nation-seller who sold out the nation's vital interest 
under the veil of civilian government. 
  The pro-U.S. flunkyist nation-selling act of the puppet 
traitor was, above all, the opening of the market of rice, which 
is blood and flesh of the South Korean people. 
  Even successive puppets did not dare to touch on this issue. 
Nevertheless, the puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam carried out 
behind- the-scenes negotiations with the White House over the 
issue of rice market opening, using it as a useful card, 
immediately after the merge of political parties. By doing this, 
he was selected as a presidential candidate at last. 
  As was disclosed to the world, Pak Chol-on made remarks 
during the presidential elections that if he were to speak out, 
Kim Yong- sam would be removed from office. His remarks 
referred to such maneuvers by Kim Yong-sam, and Kim Yong-sam's 
imprisoning him was designed to shut his mouth. 
  During the so-called summit held between South Korea and the 
United States on 23 November last year in the wake of the 
Uruguay Round negotiation, traitor Kim Yong-sam secretly pledged 
the opening of the rice markets and finally signed the 
memorandum of agreement. 
  Because of the traitorous act of the puppet Kim Yong-sam, 
agriculture in South Korea faced destiny of complete bankruptcy 
and six million South Korean farmers lost means of living. Thus, 
South Korea has been deprived of even the last foundation of 
national economy and reduced to the U.S. rice market. 
  The criminal act of the puppet Kim Yong-sam as a flunkyist 
nation-seller did not end at this. As has been known, Clinton's 
idea for the new Pacific community is designed to hold in check 
[kyonje] Japan and China with the U.S. system for colonial 
domination over South Korea as the axis and to bind countries in 
the Asia and Pacific region with its domination system. 
  Nevertheless, the puppet Kim Yong-sam, who attended the 
Asian- Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Seattle last 
November, stated that his new diplomacy is similar to Clinton's 
idea for the new Pacific community, thus attempting to court 
Clinton's favor. He then put the rope of this domination system 
on South Korea. 
  Moreover, last April, the puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam agreed 
to allow the United States to freely use port facilities in 
South Korea in an emergency according to the agreement on 
wartime support for the occupation forces concluded with the 
United States. In May, he conceded most U.S. Air Force 
facilities, which were to be turned over to South Korea, to the 
U.S. Seventh Air Force so that it can use these facilities 
continuously. Following this, in August, he effectuated the plan 
for supplementing logistics and civilian manpower to the U.S. 
Forces through the "93-Ulchi Focus-Lens" exercise. Thus, he 
reduced the whole land of South Korea to a consumption object 
for execution of the U.S. strategy. 
  With a view to keeping U.S. Forces in South Korea, the 
puppet 
traitor Kim Yong-sam fabricated even a nation-selling special 
treaty to increase the rate of sharing expenses for maintaining 
U.S. Forces in South Korea during South Korea-U.S. annual 
security consultative conference and South Korea-U.S. summit. 
Thus, he finally made the reduction of U.S. Forces in South 
Korea withheld. 
  The pro-Japan flunkyist nation-selling act of puppet traitor 
Kim Yong-sam far surpasses the pro-Japan flunkyist acts of Pak 
Chong-hui and Kim Chong-pil. The puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam 
once denounced Kim Chong-pil, who signed the South Korea-Japan 
treaty, as a pro- Japan nation-seller more vicious than the five 
traitors of the Ulsa Protectorate Treaty [of 1905] between Korea 
and Japan. However, he invited Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa 
and reconfirmed the nation- selling agreement on basic relations 
between South Korea and Japan. Moreover, he committed a 
flunkyist nation-selling act by nullifying Japan's past crimes. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, whose political foundation 
is 
weaker than any successive puppet regime, entered more deeply 
into Japan's economic and military sphere in an attempt to win 
its support. 
  The Japanese reactionaries built high barriers against South 
Korean products. However, the Kim Yong-sam nation-selling clique 
announced his so-called economic policy toward Japan in last 
August. According to this policy, the measures on banning 
imports of some Japanese commodities, which have been 
implemented only for form's sake, will be completely lifted by 
1997. 
  While advancing along the road of military collaboration 
with 
Japan which is emerging as a great nuclear state and great 
military power, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique let the 
high-ranking officers of the Japan Self-Defense Forces 
participate [chamga] in the Team Spirit joint military exercise 
under the pretext of an observers team. 
  Because of pro-U.S. and pro-Japan flunkyist nation-selling 
acts of the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, South Korea's 
subordination to the United States and Japan has been further 
deepened and South Korea is falling in depth as a dual colony of 
the United States and Japan.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 8 (KCNA) -- Robert Charvin, 
secretary general of the International Committee of Jurists for 
Democracy and Human Rights in South Korea, on December 22, 1993, 
issued a written statement exposing the United States and South 
Korean authorities' anti-DPRK, anti-popular moves and 
distributed it to UN nongovernmental and other international 
organizations. 
  The statement charged that the United States was kicking up 
a 
nuclear racket on the pretext of North Korea's "nuclear threat" 
with a view to justifying its acts of interference against Asia. 
  The Seoul "civilian government", it said, defined North 
Korea 
as "a danger" and has brought even the North-South dialogue to a 
deadlock, still following the methods employed by the former 
military dictatorial "regime", to continually intensify 
crackdown on the South Korean people. 
  The statement noted that the South Korean authorities, 
ignoring the righteous aspirations of South Korean students, 
have been ruthlessly trampling upon even the elementary human 
rights of the people and opened the rice market to jeopardize 
the existence of peasants. 
  It referred to the South Korean authorities' failure to urge 
Japan to pay compensations for the "comfort women for the Army".

Suharto urged all parties concerned to sincerely contribute to 
creating the needed circumstances for talks on the solution of 
the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  In a statement on the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula 
he issued on January 5 in the name of the chairman of the 
Non-Aligned Movement [NAM], he recalled that heads of state and 
government of all member nations of the NAM, at the 10th summit 
conference of the non-aligned nations, had discussed the 
affirmative development for the peaceful reunification of Korea 
and realization of the joint declaration on the denuclearisation 
of the Korean peninsula and expressed support for them. 
  The president said that Indonesia, as the chairman-state of 
the NAM, had got a series of measures taken to create a climate 
favorable to a peaceful solution of the nuclear issue. 
Indonesia is firmly convinced that the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea, a member of the NAM, is intending to solve 
the nuclear problem through negotiations, he said, and added: It 
welcomes the will of all parties concerned to solve the nuclear 
problem through negotiations.

  The letter said: "The government of the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea demanded that the Armistice Agreement be 
replaced with a peace agreement and that the `U.N. Command' in 
South Korea be dissolved. But the United States and South Korea 
answered this with nuclear war exercises and with a grave 
provocation by alleging that the DPRK was using its peaceful 
nuclear facilities for the `production of nuclear weapons.'" 
  Noting that the United Nations is under moral obligations to 
see that the DPRK and the United States sign a peace agreement 
and contribute to the independent and peaceful reunification of 
Korea, the letter urged the UN secretary-general to show enough 
response to this end.

article today. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song put forward a proposal 
for founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo, a 
proposal of reunification in the form of confederation based on 
one nation, one state, two systems and two governments, as the 
most realistic and reasonable way of achieving the independent 
and peaceful reunification of the country on the three 
principles of national reunification, the article notes, and 
goes on: 
  The proposal of reunification through confederacy based on 
one nation, one state, two systems and two governments is to 
reunify the country by founding a unified one national state 
while leaving the different systems and governments existing in 
the North and the South as they are. 
  The DPRK's proposal for reunification in the form of 
confederation is one based on national unity, placing the 
interests of the nation above anything else. 
  It is also based on the fact that two different systems and 
governments may co-exist within one national state. The 
difference in systems and ideas cannot be a condition for 
keeping one nation divided into two forever, nor can it be an 
insurmountable obstacle in reunifying the North and the South. 
The two systems can co-exist within one nation, unified one 
state when they are based on the national commonness which has 
been carried down through a five thousand year long history. 
  The DPRK's proposal for reunification through confederacy 
indicates the way of reunification on the basis of the national 
idea placing the nation above the system, and it is the most 
reasonable proposal to realise the national reunification by 
means of forming one confederal state, taking into consideration 
the unanimous demand of the people who aspire after 
reunification and the national commonness which has been formed 
for a long period, under the present conditions in which the two 
different systems exist in the North and the South. 
  No matter how the situation may change, we will make all 
efforts in the future, too, to reunify the country through 
confederacy on the three principles of independence, peaceful 
reunification and great national unity in conformity with the 
will and desire of the whole nation.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 9 (KCNA) -- Paek In-chun, 
chairman of the North side headquarters of the National Alliance 
for the Country's Reunification [Pomminnyon], Hyon Chun-kuk, 
chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Journalists 
Union, and Kang Kwan-son, secretary of the Central Committee of 
the Korean Democratic Women's Union, published statements 
Saturday in support of the policy of national reunification set 
forth by the great leader President Kim Il-song in his New Year 
address. 
  Chairman Paek In-chun says that the principled stand of the 
Workers' Party of Korea and the DPRK Government on national 
reunification clarified by President Kim Il-song in his New Year 
address is a highly important guideline indicating a clear way 
of achieving national reunification by the internal strength of 
the nation in the 90s. 
  "All the people in the Northern half of Korea, together with 
the fellow countrymen in the South and overseas, will wage a 
more vigorous struggle to make this year a historic year in 
opening a new phase for national reunification, meeting all 
manner of challenges of the imperialists and the South Korean 
authorities," he states. 
  Hyon Chun-kuk says that the only way of achieving the 
reunification of the country peacefully is to adopt the 
confederacy formula based on the three principles of national 
reunification. "All the journalists and editors in the Northern 
half of Korea will wield the pen more vigorously to implement 
the policy," he stressed. 
  Saying that the women should do their share in achieving the 
unity of the nation under the 10-point programme of the great 
unity of the whole nation, Secretary Kang Kwan-son ardently 
appealed to the Korean women in the North, South and overseas to 
turn out as one in the nationwide struggle for national 
reunification.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 10 (KCNA) -- The head of state of 
Namibia and a party leader of Tunisia expressed support to the 
Korean people's cause of national reunification when they met 
with the Korean ambassadors to their countries. 
  Namibian President Sam Nujoma said Namibia would continue to 
support in the future, too, the Korean people in the struggle to 
realize reunification of the country. 
  He said the United States has not abandoned its aggressive 
nature toward other countries. 
  Mohamed Bel Hadj Amor, general secretary of the People's 
Unity Party of Tunisia, actively supported the tasks to glorify 
the cause of Korean-style socialism, the policy of national 
reunification and foreign policy set forth by the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song in his New Year address. 
  In the New Year, too, the DPRK will continue to exalt its 
might as a powerful country in the van of the developing 
countries, he said. 
  He hoped that the concrete wall, a symbol of Korea's 
division, would be removed and an epochal advance be made in the 
struggle of the Korean people to reunify the country.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 8 (KCNA) -- Mozambican President 
Joaquim Alberto Chissano received a Korean Agro-Technicians 
Cooperation delegation on January 3 and said there is no change 
in Mozambique's principled stand of supporting Korea's 
reunification. 
  Noting that the new year address of the great comrade 
President Kim Il-song indicates in detail the way of building 
socialism and reunifying Korea, he said Mozambique holds that 
Korea should be reunified according to the confederacy formula 
and 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation 
advanced by the president. 
  There is no other way but to carry the confederacy formula 
into effect for the reunification of Korea, he stressed, adding 
that the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula must be solved 
through DPRK- USA talks.

  [Text] Vienna, Jan. 10 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) held a second official 
working-level contact Monday [10 January] but failed to make any 
progress on arranging IAEA inspection of North Korean nuclear 
facilities. 
  Yun Ho-chin, a councilor at the North Korean Embassy in 
Vienna, represented his country at the two-hour talks, in which 
the IAEA explained technical details of the need to maintain 
continuity in surveillance materials in response to the North 
Korean position conveyed at the first meeting Friday [7 January]. 
  The IAEA presented its explanation and demands to the North 
Korean side on paper. 
  "The North Korean representative and the IAEA had a 
working-level contact to discuss problems of inspection on North 
Korea's reported nuclear facilities on Monday," IAEA Spokesman 
Hans Meyer said. 
  "At the meeting, the IAEA has conveyed technical 
requirements 
(for the inspection) to the North Korean side." 
  Meyer declined to disclose further information. 
  One IAEA source said, however, the IAEA action means that 
there are differences of opinion on the scope of the inspection 
on North Korea's seven reported nuclear facilities. 
  Practical problems such as dispatch of the inspection team 
could be discussed only after the two sides agree on the scope 
of the inspection, the source said, requesting anonymity. 
  At Friday's meeting, North Korea told the IAEA that it would 
not accept inspection of two sites, a radiochemical laboratory 
that is in effect a nuclear reprocessing facility and a 
5-megawatt reactor, another IAEA source said. 
  As a result, the two sides are standing far apart as the 
IAEA 
demands opening of those two facilities as well, the source said. 
  Spokesman David Kyd, meanwhile, said that the IAEA does not 
expect immediate progress in the problem of inspection on two 
unreported sites believed to be nuclear waste storage facilities. 
  The two sides are expected to resume their talks this week.

  [Text] During a working-level contact with North Korea on 
10 January, the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
delivered a technological checklist on the collection of samples 
from nuclear material and the examination of an operation diary 
[unyong ilchi] of seven nuclear facilities and requested that 
North Korea inform the IAEA of its decision on accepting 
inspections within this week. 
  The IAEA also informed the North Korean side that in order 
to 
inspect seven facilities in accordance with the technological 
check list, it is necessary that at least six to seven 
inspectors carry out activities for three weeks. 
  It was learned that the technological checklist delivered to 
North Korea includes items on determining if the number and 
material of the five megawatt-nuclear fuel rods in Yongbyon 
correspond with what North Korea had previously reported to the 
IAEA, examining the operation diary, and replacing surveillance 
equipment. 
  In particular, it was learned that, if a radiochemical 
laboratory is a reprocessing facility, the amount of nuclear 
material remaining in tanks and pipes will be measured. In 
addition, samples from the laboratory will collected and 
inspectors will check sealed devices and replace surveillance 
equipment. Public attention is focused on the North Korean 
response, which is expected in two or three days.

  [Text] The violent death of Vicente Martinez, a former New 
People's Army (NPA) leader, might start a "chain reaction of 
bloody confrontations" between rival factions of the Communist 
Party of the Philippines (CPP). 
  Top communist dissidents expressed this fear yesterday in a 
statement condemning the "senseless murder" of Martinez by three 
gunmen who barged in his house in Antipolo, Rizal, last 2 
January. 
  Martinez, 44, was shot several times in the head and body in 
the presence of his wife and son, police said. His assailants 
had introduced themselves as agents of the National Bureau of 
Investigation. "Whoever perpetrated this cowardly crime, 
whether the Ramos government agents or the Stalinist faction, 
must be punished," said Victor Del Mar, CPP Visayas Commission 
chair, and Bimbo Magtanggol, NPA Visayas commander. 
  Del Mar is believed to be the rebel name of Arturo Tabara, 
who recently declared his group's autonomy from the party's 
"Stalinist faction" because of ideological and political 
differences. 
  The "Stalinist faction" is reportedly headed by Armando 
Liwanag said to be the guerrilla name of exiled CPP founding 
chairman, Jose Maria Sison, and Benito Tiamzon, alleged acting 
chairman of the party. 
  Del Mar and Magtanggol identified Martinez as "Comrade 
Poping," a former member of the Visayas Commission, vice 
commanding officer of NPA-Visayas and member of the Eastern 
Visayan Party Secretariat. 
  They said he was an active opposition leader in the CPP and 
one of the signatories to a petition calling for a special party 
plenum, "and thus earned the ire of the ... Stalinist faction." 
  Martinez was arrested in 1990 in Quezon City and charged 
with 
illegal possession of firearms in furtherance of rebellion. He 
was released in 1992 as part of the government's peace 
initiative with communist rebels. 
  Before he was killed, Martinez worked as a peasant organizer 
in Samar under the Philippine Ecumenical Action for Community 
Empowerment (PEACE) Foundation, a nongovernmental organization. 
  "Comrade Poping's death signals the escalation of the party 
crisis to a higher and violent stage," Del Mar and Magtanggol 
said. 
  They placed "primary responsibility" for the incident on the 
Stalinist faction "for creating the conditions which the Ramos 
government and its agents could exploit to sow bloody intrigues" 
within the revolutionary movement. 
  As of press time last night, Sison could not be reached for 
comment at his base in Utrecht, the Netherlands. 
  "We call on all party members in the opposition and the 
broad 
masses of the people to condemn this senseless crime and to take 
steps to put a stop to a possible chain reaction of bloody 
confrontations," Del Mar and Magtanggol said. 
  The anti-Sison rebels said their communist adversaries have 
declared intent and capability for the "physical elimination" of 
their detractors. 
  They were referring to an order announced by CPP spokesman 
Gregorio "Comrade Roger" Rosal last month to try critics before 
"people's courts" for alleged crimes against the people. 
  Issued "charge sheets" were Tabara; Romulo Kintanar, alleged 
former NPA chief; Felimon Lagman, head of the CPP Metro 
Manila-Rizal committee; and Ricardo Reyes, alleged CPP 
secretary general.

  [Excerpt] Bangkok, Jan 11 (AFP) -- A massive cache of 
weapons discovered near the Cambodian border in December remains 
under army control pending settlement of possible claims for 
ownership, a Thai army official said Tuesday.

Thanacharo, said he had not been informed of any official 
claims. He would not say where the weapons were being held. 
  "All weapons found last December in Chanthaburi have been 
put

announcer] 
  [Text] The National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK]'s 
spokesman rejects the fallacious accusations about the Thai Army 
helping the Khmer Rouge by firing artillery shells against the 
puppet troops. 
  1. Of late, there have been accusations about the Thai Army 
helping the Khmer Rouge by firing artillery shells against 
communist Vietnamese puppet troops. 
  2. The NADK spokesman categorically and totally rejects 
those (?shameless) accusations. 
  3. It is common knowledge that the communist Vietnamese 
puppet troops of the two-headed government has been conducting 
the military offensives against the Democratic Kampuchea party 
and the Cambodian people at the current 16th dry season. Those 
fallacious accusations are part of their bad political scheme 
aimed at concealing their defeats on the battlefield and 
(?against) the national reconciliation policy and the five-point 
guideline of his majesty the king toward national 
reconciliation, peace, and national unity in Cambodia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Han Sung-su, ROK ambassador to the United </F>
States, by Washington-based correspondent Chin Chang-uk in 
Washington; date not given] 
  [Text] [Chin] What is your assessment of the current 
relations between the ROK and the United States? 
  [Han] The top leaders of the two countries have consolidated 
their friendship through the two rounds of ROK-U.S. summit talks 
last year. The United States assesses the ROK quite positively 
because of its political and economic reform and opening-up 
policy, and relations between the two countries are now smoother 
than ever. 
  Both the ROK and the United States have had difficulty 
because of the nuclear issue, but they have maintained firm 
mutual cooperation on the issue. In conclusion, I do not think 
we will have any problem in relations with the United States in 
the new year. 
  [Chin] How will ROK-U.S. relations develop in the new year? 
  [Han] Because the United States is likely to strengthen its 
economic diplomacy with China and Japan in the new year, we need 
to do our best to prevent this from exerting negative influence 
upon our country. 
  In its trade with the United States, Japan keeps the balance 
of $50 billion in the black a year. Due to its continued 
economic slump, however, Japan cannot easily find an effective 
way to avoid its trade imbalance. Accordingly, economic 
diplomacy between the United States and Japan will undergo 
vicissitudes this year. 
  When the United States agreed to extend the term of the 
most-favored-nation treatment for China last year, it added a 
provision that China improve its human rights situation. This 
is likely to become the point at issue in relations between the 
two countries this year. 
  The United States seems to be determining that there has 
been 
no considerable improvement in human rights in China. 
Accordingly, I think, the United States and China will go into 
a dispute over the extension of the term of the 
most-favored-nation treatment for China this year. 
  Among the three Northeast Asian countries, the ROK is the 
only country that maintains a trade balance with the United 
States. Therefore, the ROK will have no economic friction 
[kyongje machal] with the United States. As it is possible, 
however, that the U.S. approach toward China and Japan will 
affect us any way, we have to prevent its negative affect. 
  [Chin] What do you think are our prospects for trade with 
the United States this year? 
  [Han] The ROK registered negative growth in its exports to 
the United States in 1991 and 1992. Owing to the rehabilitation 
of the U.S. economy to a certain degree, the growth of ROK 
exports to the United States for 1993 was up 1 percent from 
1992. As the U.S. economy is expected to progress more 
favorably this year, I will make efforts to increase our trade 
with it. 
  Particularly, it is important to induce the ultramodern U.S. 
industries to advance into China and Japan with the ROK as a 
stepping-stone. 
  [Chin] What is our diplomatic policy toward the United 
States for the future? 
  [Han] The ROK diplomacy with the United States was somewhat 
subordinate to the Japan-oriented diplomacy of the United States 
in the past. 
  The ROK should now abandon its position as a subordinate 
variable of U.S.-Japanese diplomatic relations and establish its 
independent relationship with the United States. 
  The ROK has already become a country that the United States 
needs politically, militarily, and economically. By 
strengthening this position, the ROK is now developing 
independent relations with the United States. 
  Thus, the ROK should discard its government-oriented 
diplomacy and develop a ranging diplomacy involving the 
parliament and academic, press, and business circles.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 11 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
stressed Tuesday [11 January] closest South Korea-U.S. 
cooperation and understanding now on the North Korean nuclear 
problem while repeating that the problem has to be solved for 
Korean and regional peace. 
  Kim met with visiting American senators Sam Nunn and Richard 
Lugar over breakfast and requested continued support from the 
U.S. Congress for such cooperation, Spokesman Chu Ton-sik said. 
  Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and 
his entourage came to Seoul after visiting Russia on what 
officials here called a field trip. 
  The spokesman said there was no discussion of sanctions on 
North Korea in case diplomatic dialogue fails but described the 
senators visit as intended to gather necessary information on 
various possibilities if sanctions become inevitable. 
  Nunn reaffirmed the U.S. security commitment to Seoul, 
recalling President Bill Clinton's words that an attack on South 
Korea is an attack on the United States. This, he said, was the 
position of the United States. 
  He called South Korea-U.S. cooperation an invaluable 
prerequisite to stability on the Korean peninsula and added that 
American troops need to stay in South Korea, the spokesman said. 
  The senators return to Washington later Tuesday.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "The Lao-American Cooperation on </F>
the Problem of Prisoners of War and Personnel Missing in Action 
During Wartime"] 
  [Text] Respected listeners, on 2 January, the Voice of 
America, which is known to all as a mouthpiece of the U.S. State 
Department, carried a report slandering the Lao People's 
Democratic Republic [LPDR] by saying that as many as 41 American 
prisoners of war remain in the LPDR. The report added that the 
U.S. Senate Investigative Committee should make Laos a priority 
in its efforts. 
  The following are the facts about this issue that everyone 
should know: After the end of the Indochinese war in 1975, the 
Lao side returned to the U.S. side all nine American prisoners 
of war. Since then, the U.S. side has admitted that there are 
no more American prisoners of war in Laos. Nevertheless, for 
humanitarian reasons and acting in response to requests from the 
U.S. Government, the Lao Government has always cooperated with 
the U.S. side in searching for and collecting information about 
personnel missing in action in Laos. In 1985, 1986, and up to 
the present time, Lao officials have respectfully cooperated 
with American officials and done their best in conducting 
surveys and excavating areas around plane crashes in 11 
provinces, in accordance with all suggestions and plans from the 
U.S. side. Between 1985 and November 1993, the two sides 
jointly conducted surveys and excavations on 34 occasions in 11 
provinces. So far, the remains of some 50 American pilots of 
planes shot down in wartime have been discovered and retrieved. 
The total number of American personnel missing in action in 
Laos, in accordance with official U.S. figures, is 514. 
  In addition, to remove the doubt and suspicion of the U.S. 
side, which has claimed that American prisoners of war remain 
alive in Laos in accordance with information it has received 
from certain exiled Lao refugees or deceivers who have taken 
advantage of the situation to make money or profit from other 
people's suffering, the Lao side has agreed to allow technical 
teams from of both countries to jointly investigate all 
suggestions of the U.S. side. Examples are the case of Captain 
Borah, who was found after the investigation to be a Lao Theuang 
tribesman, namely (a Lao), and the case of First Lieutenant 
(Kha,) who was later found to be a German businessman running 
his business in Thailand, namely (Gunbe). There were also 
similar cases in Xieng Khouang and Hopua Phan Provinces. Another 
recent one was the case of a person in Toumlan District, who was 
later found to be a physician attached to (?a medical team 
operating in a border area). All cases of live prisoners of war 
turned out to be groundless after joint investigation. They are 
all fabricated stories. 
  In view of the fact that the technical teams and officials 
of 
both sides have unanimously concluded that progress has been 
achieved in cooperation in dealing with the problem of prisoners 
of war and personnel missing in action, what are the hidden 
purposes and intentions of the Voice of America in its 
indiscriminate and irresponsible reports? The Lao people feel 
very disappointed about this outdated trick. The Lao people 
have now asked themselves why in the world does our country have 
to sincerely cooperate with the U.S. side, despite the fact that 
during the war, tens of thousands of their sons and nephews were 
killed by U.S. bombs and they have not been paid any 
compensation. If the Voice of America, which has served as the 
mouthpiece officially conveying the views of the U.S. 
Government, continues to carry such slanderous news, it will 
only continue to increase doubt and suspicion between the 
peoples of the two countries. The only result will be that the 
cooperation in searching for the personnel missing in action 
during the war will be affected.

<F P=106> [Article: "45 Years of Growth and Victory of the LPA"] </F>
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] To continue punishing the 
enemy, in May 1962 the Lao People's Army [LPA] started the 
battle to liberate Louang Namtha and destroyed 10 enemy 
battalions. After this they went on to new victories. The LPA 
maintained its control of the situation and attacked the enemy 
fiercely at many points. In addition they resolutely beat back 
the large enemy offensive in the area of Phou Soung and the 
junction at Sala Phou Khoun 27 times, liberated Kasi District, 
Vang Viang District, Hinheup and other places and forced the 
American imperialists and the opposing side to sign the Geneva 
Treaty of 1962 for Laos and agree to the formation of the 
coalition government of the three factions which reunited Laos 
for the second time. 
  In addition to supporting and using the rightist forces, the 
American intelligence department created a special force (the 
Vang Pao force). This was the second force under the direct 
command of the Americans. Its purpose was to carry out the long 
term policy of dividing the nation and destroying the 
revolution. They built this force up from 5,000 to 30,000 and 
gradually used this force to attack and seize liberated areas. 
They used this force to seize Pha Thi in an insane attack. This 
was a position in a liberated area of ours. 
  After they were painfully defeated at Pha Thi and other 
places, they hoped to redeem themselves from these defeats. The 
American imperialists assembled 50 battalions of special forces 
including many Thai battalions. With major support from American 
forces and the engagement of every type of aircraft including 
strategic B-52's, they started Operation "Kou Kiat" [redeem 
honor] in August 1969, an insane attack against the liberated 
areas of the Plain of Jars and Xieng Khouang. After they had 
advanced their forces, they put into effect the policy of the 
three eliminations which was very brutal. 
  In order to punish the enemy, at the beginning of December 
1970 the LPA and patriotic, neutralist forces fiercely attacked 
the special forces of Vang Pao. They destroyed all the major 
positions of the enemy so that the special forces of Vang Pao 
were not able to further defend the reactionary Thai forces in 
the center. The YMT 21 of the special forces of Vang Pao was 
seriously hurt, and then their YMT 23 was wiped out completely. 
This caused the three Thai battalions on Phou Keng to be cut 
off. That same month the flank of the LPA south of the Plain of 
Jars attacked the Thai forces in Ban Ton Village and wiped out 
four battalions. By attacking along with the other flank in the 
West, the LPA was able to attack the two battalions of the 
special forces of Vang Pao at Meuang Soui and shatter them. At 
the same time we wiped out the Thai reactionary forces located 
at Phou Keng completely. 
  With this storm of attacks by the patriotic armed forces, we 
caused the enemy to lose spirit. In just 3 days of fierce 
coordinated attacks from every direction and flank, our LPA 
liberated the Plain of Jars and Meuang Soui and completely took 
back the area the enemy had seized. They drove the enemy back to 
its bases at Sam Thong, Long Cheng, Sala Phou Khoun and Kasi. 
They had eliminated and weakened more than 20 enemy battalions. 
Of these 10 were Thai reactionary battalions. 
  Because of their incorrigible love of war, the American 
imperialists started the Lam Son 719 operation at the beginning 
of 1971. They used more 20,000 soldiers of the Saigon puppet 
regime supported by American aircraft and artillery. But the 
army and people of Savannakhet working with the liberation army 
from the South of Vietnam resolutely defeated them in the battle 
called "Lam Son 719" along highway 9. Their forces were 
shattered during 44 days and nights. This was a heavy blow for 
the "Nixon" doctrine that Indochinese should be used to fight 
Indochinese. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by A. Pheuanchai: "32 Years of Bravery of the </F>
Anti-Aircraft Corps"] 
  [Excerpts] Faced with an ever more chaotic situation 
because of the air war of the imperialist invaders, the 
anit-aircraft unit--although at that time it was still not 
organized as an official unit--still provided a way of putting 
up an ever fiercer resistance while responding to the situation. 
It countered enemy attacks in a timely fashion and defended the 
skies and green mountains. 
  In the 1960's the neo-colonialists developed a secret scheme 
to invade Laos. They rashly tried to escalate the war against 
the patriotic Lao people hoping to wipe out the Lao people's 
revolutionary forces completely. Therefore the unit carried out 
the orders of the supreme headquarters of the Free Lao [Neo Lao 
Itsara] Army and on 18 October 1961 the first anti-aircraft 
battalion cleared the skies using bullets against the iron of 
the imperialist invaders. This unit was established at Ban Nong 
Nam Village in Pek District of Xieng Khouang Province. It was 
commanded by Comrade Chan and Comrade Simeuang. It was organized 
in three companies. Two companies were armed with 37 mm guns, 
and one company was armed with 12.8 mm guns. 
  After the battalion was established, it was assigned to 
fighting the enemy in the air. The first company fought the 
enemy in the air over Khang Khai (Xieng Khouang). Every bullet 
hit the aircraft and penetrated the enemy iron. The F-101, which 
was a very modern aircraft just produced by the Americans, 
immediately turned over and over and fell to the earth in Xieng 
Khouang. This was the first aircraft shot down in Indochina. 
When this first aircraft spun to earth, it created a great deal 
of fear in their air force. The LPA in contrast was very proud 
and decided resolutely to follow the leadership of the party. On 
24 June 1994 [as published] the battle to liberate the Plain of 
Jars started. The anti-aircraft battalion worked with the 
infantry to block the enemy's routes for retreat from the Plain 
of Jars at Meuang Soui, Lat Ngon, Phou Ba, Khoua Lek and Khoua 
Nam Yen. In November 1964 the enemy attacked Phou Kout with its 
air force, artillery, and infantry. The enemy force was many 
times larger than ours. The battle to defend Phou Kout was 
fought back and forth fiercely with the two sides less than 25 
meters apart. The Lao revolutionary combatants were very 
patriotic. 
  Comrade Phimmason, a young combatant, used a 12.8 mm gun to 
hit a T-28 and then used a light machine gun to fire into the 
enemy columns advancing on the ground. This comrade fighting 
alone delayed a great number of the enemy in order to allow his 
entire platoon to attack enemy aircraft. In the end this comrade 
sacrificed his life bravely on the battlefield. When the battle 
was over, this brave unit had shot down five T-28's and damaged 
seven. They had also destroyed three armored vehicles and killed 
28 of the enemy. 
  In the course of its duties which included constant fighting 
from 1961 to 1973, the unit took part in the liberation of the 
nation as follows: it fought against aircraft 1055 times, shot 
down 285 aircraft of all types, fought 49 battles on land, and 
captured, killed and caused to surrender many hundreds of the 
enemy. They destroyed many weapons and much military equipment. 
They defended more than 4,000 people in Pek District and Khoun 
District. They built a revolutionary support base in four 
villages and built a 160 member guerrilla network. For these 
accomplishments the unit received 14 unit decorations and 41 
individual decorations. One comrade was named a national hero, 
and two comrades were decorated for diligence. [passage omitted] 
  During the period from 1973 to 1993 the battalion achieved 
more successes to further mark its 32 year tradition. It fought 
against aircraft two times hitting five aircraft and shooting 
down two. It captured two pilots and killed five of the enemy. 
Now the cadres and combatants in this battalion are impressed 
with these traditions of bravery and are prepared to dedicate 
their lives to their revolutionary duty in the new era.

<F P=106> [Article by Boualapha Thindoi: "The Heroics of Anti-aircraft </F>
Battalion `456'"] 
  [Excerpts] When we think back again to the lives and 
battles of the cadres and combatants of the Anti-aircraft Corps 
and especially of the cadres and combatants of the 456th 
Anti-aircraft Battalion and those who went through the war or 
were in the unit then, one can only say that it is a frightening 
image because the fighting involved one side using modern 
explosives and weapons to wipe out another side which was not 
willing to surrender but staked their lives for their patriotic 
ideals. 
  The Geneva treaty for Laos of 1962 was trampled on and 
destroyed completely by the special war of the imperialists, 
which they steadily escalated. In addition to their mobilizing 
the rightist forces and the special forces of Vang Pao to attack 
and seize liberated areas, starting on 17 May 1964 they used 
their air force to brazenly destroy our country. They used 
various types of aircraft to drop many kinds of bombs and 
brutally kill our people who had done nothing wrong. This lit 
the fire of anger among the multi-ethnic Lao people more and 
more, and it caused them to rise up and fight an ever broader 
people's war. It also mobilized the spirit for battle of the 
cadres and combatants of the Anti-aircraft Battalion. 
  The enemy air war grew steadily fiercer especially in Viang 
Sai District, the stronghold of the revolution. This was a 
special target for the air pirates who wanted to destroy the 
base of the patriotic forces. They used various types of 
aircraft to drop bombs every day in hundreds of sorties. Every 
day the Viang Sai base was covered by a frightening amount smoke 
and wreckage from explosions. 
  This fierce warfare forced our army to strengthen the 
Anti-aircraft Corps and improve its combat capabilities. This 
was the reaction to the "spreading fire" which required water to 
be put out. They combined the 26th, 27th, 28th and 29th 
anti-aircraft companies to create an anti-aircraft battalion on 
2 May 1965. Its assignment was air defense for central Viang 
Sai. This battalion was under the command of Comrade Khamchan. 
Comrade Sao was responsible for political activities. Comrade 
Phonkeo was chief of staff. Leadership was provided by the 
artillery department of Supreme Headquarters. 
  After being established the unit moved into position to 
defend the position of the central leadership of the Lao 
Patriotic Front and worked to improve the various support bases 
which were necessary. The unit mobilized the people to be 
patriotic and hate the enemy and to send their sons to join the 
ranks of the army amd do other things. They had to overcome 
difficulties and confusion of many kinds, but the most important 
task was mobilizing the fighting spirit of the cadres and 
combatants within the unit to continue our army's brave 
tradition that it was better to die than to surrender. Not long 
after the establishment of the unit the imperialists on 4, 5 and 
6 June 1965 used aircraft of various types to drop bombs in 
attacking Viang Sai District again. This was a ferocious attack. 
Their aircraft attacked for 3 days and nights; there was not 
even a minute without the sounds of aircraft and explosions of 
various kinds reverberating. They not only wanted to wipe out 
the revolutionary forces but also made the mountains, which 
symbolized the beauty of the area, into level ground. [passage 
omitted] All levels of cadres and all combatants were united in 
their resolve to fight to the death and to let their gun 
emplacements be their graves. Initially the gun emplacements 
were covered with branches, but after many hours of battle the 
force of the explosions against the gun emplacements began to 
expose them. This gave the air pirates targets so that they 
could attack each emplacement fiercely. Nevertheless they were 
not able to suppress the revolutionary spirit of the unit. 
Against this steel we had to be brave. In this battle to defend 
Viang Sai District not only were the cadres and combatants able 
to maintain the security of the central command, but they were 
also able to shoot down and destroy 12 aircraft. This was the 
origin of the name of the 4.5.6 Anti-aircraft Battalion. 
  During the entire period that the unit performed its air 
defense duties, it took part in 527 small and large-scale 
engagements. Of these 150 were fierce battles. They shot down 
more than 110 aircraft and captured 5 pilots. Because of these 
accomplishments the battalion was honored by the party and upper 
echelons with 12 freedom medals, two bravery medals, and one 
bravery banner. One combatant was made a national hero. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Vientiane, January 11 (KPL) -- The construction of a 
hydro-power dam on Ho River in the Province of Champassak is in 
progress, said the head of the project, Mr. Bounkeut 
Khamphaphongphan. 
  The main work done in the past two months includes building 
a 
26-km road from Lasasin area to the construction site of the 
dam. The road is the first to link the area and the province of 
Attopeu. 
  The dam construction is a project the Government of Laos has 
signed a contract with a construction company of South Korea in 
the form of BOT 'build-operate-transfer'. This means that the 
investor puts money into building the facility then recovers its 
cost within 30 years. The Lao party holds a share of 20 per 
cent. After the period, the facility will be transferred to the 
Lao Government. 
  According to the official, now equipment worth U.S. dollars 
five million has reached the site, and field survey has started 
using a seismic equipment to define the construction site. 
  Another work to be done soon is determining water and forest 
areas for catchment, areas for conservation of bio-diversity, 
areas for tourism and areas where evacuation of people will be 
made. 
  This building project was scheduled for four years. The 
water current will be blocked in May 1996 and trial operation 
will be in the middle of October 1996. The hydro-power dam has 
a 150 megawatt capacity. The height of the dam is 80 metres 
while the width of its foot is 300 metres. The dam crest will 
be used as a road for vehicles to go to Attopeu District and 
Vietnam.

Evening Edition] 
  [Text] At a news conference held after the cabinet meeting 
on 11 January, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata commented on the Japan-U.S. economic framework 
talks, where the deadline to reach agreement on 11 February (the 
Japan-U.S. summit meeting is scheduled on this date) is only a 
month away. He said: "From the point of view of improving the 
Japanese people's quality of life, it is important that Japan 
deals with economic issues voluntarily." He stressed Japan 
should actively promote more transparency in its market by 
deregulation. On the other hand, he also indicated that Japan 
would continue to ask U.S. companies to improve their 
competitiveness and exert more sales efforts, saying: "It is 
necessary not only for the buyers, but also the sellers (the 
United States) to be well-prepared."

  [Text] U.S. Commerce Under Secretary Garten arrived in 
Japan on 11 January to attend the Japan-U.S. vice ministerial 
meeting on automobiles and auto parts, as chief delegate of the 
U.S. side under the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. The 
U.S. official attended a dinner hosted by Deputy Minister 
Sozaburo Okamatsu of the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry who is chief delegate of the Japanese side. Both sides 
will hold full-fledged discussions beginning 12 January, and the 
meeting on automobiles and auto parts is set to be held again in 
Washington on 20 January. The two countries are to reach a 
final agreement in a plenary session of the meeting slated for 
late February. 
  Priority has been given to the automobiles and auto parts 
sector, government procurement sector, and insurance sector, and 
the two countries are to draw a conclusion on all sectors by 11 
February when the Japan-U.S. summit talks are to be held. With 
wide differences still remaining between the two countries over 
objective criteria to gauge the degree of market access for 
foreign goods and Japan's plans for the purchase of 
American-made auto parts, however, the two countries are 
expected to have a heated exchange at the vice ministerial 
meeting.

Edition] 
  [Text] On 11 January, a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter 
interviewed U.S. Under Secretary of State Joan Spero who is now 
on a visit to Japan to attend the Japan-U.S. economic framework 
talks. Referring to cuts in income tax, the senior U.S. official 
said: "I have heard the size of the cuts will be 6-7 trillion 
yen and I expect the cuts to lead to an expansion of Japan's 
domestic demand." She also said: "The effect of income tax cuts 
hinges on whether income tax and consumption tax are cut and 
raised simultaneously." The U.S. official suggested in a 
roundabout way that, the United States hopes Japan will defer 
raising consumption tax. 
  During the interview, Under Secretary of State Spero said: 
"Both Japan and the United Sates have committed to work on the 
macroeconomic area in their economic framework talks, and the 
U.S. Government has already made a noteworthy advance in cutting 
the budget deficit." Asked to comment on the stimulus measures 
under consideration by the Japanese Government, she declined, 
only saying: "All stimulus measures are matters to be decided by 
the Hosokawa government." But she added: "I expect the stimulus 
measures to lead to a further expansion of Japan's domestic 
demand and a cut in Japan's trade surplus. That is one of the 
goals of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks." 
  Referring to the income tax reduction, which is a pillar of 
the stimulus measures, Spero said: "It has been reported that 
the scale of the reduction will be 6-7 trillion yen and I have 
heard the reports." But she pointed out the effect of the tax 
cuts hinges on the size of the raise in consumption tax and its 
timing, which is now fueling a debate in Japan. 
  In the interview, she also stressed the need for the 
Japanese 
Government to work for not only stimulus measures, but full 
deregulations and industrial restructuring. She said: "I hope 
the Hosokawa government will come to grips with the Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks and work on a comprehensive economic 
plan after carrying out political reform."

Morning Edition] 
  [Text] The U.S. Government has compiled a report entitled: 
"In Search of a New Partnership" to seek understanding for the 
its position in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. The 
report clarifies the U.S. demands in the priority areas, 
including insurance, automobiles and auto parts, and 
telecommunications, claiming: "The United States is not seeking 
the setting of numerical targets. This report was compiled to 
dispel any misunderstanding" (according to the U.S. Embassy in 
Japan). However, Japan remains suspicious, saying, "A careful 
reading of the report shows the U.S. stance of being preoccupied 
with numerical targets remains unchanged" (according to the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI]). 
  The report emphasizes: "The U.S. Government understands that 
trade should be determined by the market mechanism, and the 
framework talks are aimed at enhancing the opposite of managed 
trade [hi-kanri boeki] in Japan." 
  However, the report does cite some figures in several 
passages, such as: "While the market share of foreign insurance 
companies in advanced nations is 10 to 34 percent, their share 
in the Japanese market is merely 2 percent." Regarding 
automobiles and auto parts, the report says: "We demand that" 
the target of increasing Japanese carmakers' purchase of 
U.S.-made parts to $19 billion in fiscal 1994 "remains in place 
even in and after 1995." 
  MITI has reacted coldly to the report, claiming: "It merely 
avoids direct expressions; the U.S. stance of being preoccupied 
with numerical targets is still discernible."

  [Text] At the Japan-U.S. summit talks slated to be held on 
11 February in Washington, President Clinton will ask Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to buy U.S. rice to cover from 60 to 
70 percent of the minimum access of rice which will come into 
effect from next year. This was disclosed by a government 
source on 8 January. It will be the first time for the leaders 
of both countries to actually talk about the rice issue at 
summit talks. It seems the U.S. Government will strengthen its 
pressure on Japan regarding the rice measures in the future. 
  According to sources concerned, President Clinton will 
likely 
make the request unofficially. It seems that following the 
conclusion of the new multilateral trade negotiations (Uruguay 
Round) of GATT, "the United States aims to secure and expand its 
rice export share before Japan actually decides from which 
countries it will import rice" (according to the government 
source). 
  The new round of negotiations over the rice issue decided -- 
as an exception to an introduction of a comprehensive tariff, 
designed to replace all import regulations with a tariff -- to 
adopt "special measures" for expansion of the minimum access 
instead of shelving the tariffication for six years. Through 
the minimum access, Japan will import about 400,000 tons of rice 
for domestic consumption in 1995. It will eventually be 
increased to about 800,000 tons. 
  Japan still has not decided which countries it is going to 
import rice from for the minimum access. However, some people 
are saying, from the viewpoint of protecting rice farmers, that 
"the government should import rice for production of rice cakes 
and other processed food" (according to Kozo Watanabe, 
representative secretary of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]). 
So far this is the strongest demand. Many people are saying 
that priority should be given to the idea of buying rice from 
Thailand instead of from the United States which is working on 
producing short-grain rice (called Japonica rice) for direct 
consumption as staple food. 
  Moreover, the rice produced in the United States is more 
expensive than Thai rice, which is used in setting the price 
index in the rice trade market. It is also true that China and 
Vietnam are exerting efforts to produce high-quality Japonica 
rice. 
  Because of this, many people think that "American rice, 
which 
will have a major impact on Japan's rice production, will not be 
imported much even after Japan's rice market is liberalized." 
This was a prevailing view even before the decision on the rice 
issue was made. 
  Under such circumstances, the Ministry of Agriculture, 
Forestry, and Fisheries is maintaining a negative stance about 
accepting U.S. requests. But political decisions are more 
important than economic principles as far as negotiations over 
the rice issue are concerned. Therefore, some government 
officials are saying that "the United States started to control 
our rice policy at the moment when we rejected immediate 
tariffication and accepted the partial liberalization," 
(according to the government source). Japan has no choice but 
to make a decision on the issue of rice imports within the scope 
of overall Japan-U.S. relations. It seems that Japan will 
constantly import a certain volume of U.S. rice by eventually 
accepting the President's request.

  [Text] On 10 January, Keidanren [Federation of Economic 
Organizations of Japan] held a meeting of the president and vice 
presidents to discuss the economic framework talks held between 
the governments of Japan and the United States. At the end of 
the discussion, the meeting adopted a statement opposing 
"macroeconomic numerical targets" designed to gauge the degree 
of market opening by sector in goods and services. The 
statement cites two reasons for opposing macroeconomic numerical 
targets, saying: 1) The Japanese Government is not in a position 
to meet such macroeconomic numerical targets; and 2) if Japan 
agrees with the United States on setting numerical values or 
anything like them, the United States will force Japan to meet 
the numerical values in accordance with the trade act; and such 
a trade arrangement could lead both Japan and the United States 
to pursue managed trade. The statement also calls on the 
governments to "deal constructively with trade issues between 
the two countries." 
  With the Japan-U.S. summit talks scheduled for 11 February, 
negotiations on such sectors as automobiles, auto parts, 
insurance, and government procurement are in the final stage, 
and Keidanren has compiled the statement in response to the 
situation. The statement warns against setting numerical 
targets by sector, claiming: "Intergovernmental negotiations 
must be confined to sectors for which the governments of the two 
nations are responsible and if the intergovernmental 
negotiations go beyond those sectors, this will invite the 
administration's intervention in the business activities of 
private enterprises and run counter to deregulation." The 
statement also points out that the European Union (EU) is 
showing an interest in managed trade after learning about it 
from Japan and the United States. 
  As an example of self-indulgence [hitoriaruki] in numerical 
targets, the statement cites semiconductors and laments that 
although the Japanese government is not supposed to commit 
itself to the import ratio of foreign-manufactured goods, it has 
done so and the commitment has forced Japanese enterprises to 
"meet" the import ratio by quarter. As for the level of 
Japanese market access for foreign goods, the United States, 
which has thus far asked Japan for a specific numerical share, 
is now asking for a level equivalent to that of European nations 
and the United States. Commenting on the turnaround in the U.S. 
trade demand, the statement refutes it, saying: "The 
supply-demand structure varies from country to country and the 
U.S. trade demand is unreasonable. The ratio of government 
procurement in aircraft, farm produce, communications gears, and 
medical instruments is higher in Japan than in European nations 
and the United States."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A U.S. Administration Working for the </F>
Realization of Change"] 
  [Text] The Clinton administration of the United States, 
which came to power advocating change, is now in its second 
year. This year, President Clinton will again be faced with 
difficult domestic and foreign affairs issues in steering the 
government. We hope that in foreign affairs, he will be able to 
take the initiative in working for world peace and security. 
  In his speech on national radio on New Year's Day, President 
Clinton pledged further efforts toward the revival of the U.S. 
economy. He also promised the realization of "employment, 
health, and personal security." This means enhancing the 
people's security by improving employment, implementing medical 
insurance reform, strengthening peace and order, and anti-crime 
measures. 
  On 3 January, a meeting of cabinet members concerned with 
medical insurance reform was held, an indication of Clinton's 
stance of exerting utmost efforts to deal with domestic issues. 
  The President might have come out with an attitude of giving 
priority to domestic problems at this early time of the year in 
anticipation of the by-election in November this year. If he 
succeeds in domestic reform, the Democratic Party would have an 
edge in the by-election, and this will also be a favorable 
factor for his reelection as president two years later. 
  Certain factors may also work in President Clinton's favor. 
The U.S. economy is on the track of recovery. Real annual 
growth rate for the October-December 1993 period was 4 to 5 
percent, and unemployment rate improved to 6.4 percent. Real 
growth rate for 1994 is forecast to be 3 percent, and 
unemployment estimated at 6 percent. Clinton is confident of an 
economic recovery. 
  Since the Clinton administration attaches importance to the 
restructuring of the U.S. economy, he is also expected to pursue 
economic diplomacy in 1994. He will probably ask for further 
opening of the market in the countries of the Asia and Pacific 
region, which is considered the economic growth center of the 
world. Improvement of Japan-U.S. economic relations in this 
region, in particular, will be necessary. 
  The Hosokawa administration is fighting an uphill battle to 
implement reforms in the Japanese political and economic 
structures. While the Clinton administration pins great hope on 
the Hosokawa administration, such reform requires considerable 
time. It would not be wise for the United States to undermine 
Japan-U.S. relations in its impatience to see results in the 
economic issues. 
  The improvement of Japan-U.S. economic relations is not only 
important for Japan, but will also be important for the United 
States to enable it to play a more active role in the complex 
international issues in the post-cold war era. Cooperation 
between Japan and the United States, which account for 40 
percent of world GNP, will be indispensable. The two countries 
also have a responsibility in revitalizing the stagnant world 
economy. 
  On the other hand, there had been a number of blunders in 
Clinton diplomacy in 1993. The United States was not able to 
take the initiative in dealing with regional conflicts in 
Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti. Some believe this was due to the 
incompetence of the three major foreign policymakers, the 
presidential assistant for national security affairs, the 
secretary of state, and the secretary of defense. 
  President Clinton replaced his deputy secretary of state, 
and 
accepted the resignation of Secretary of Defense Les Aspin in 
December. He has started to reorganize his foreign and security 
policies. Clinton diplomacy will take off during the NATO 
summit meeting starting from 10 January, and the visit to Russia 
after that. 
  It will be impermissible for the United States to take an 
inward- looking attitude amid the chaotic international 
situation. We hope the United States will succeed in realizing 
change to strengthen its diplomatic position, and exercise 
leadership in promoting international cooperation to settle 
regional conflicts and resolve other issues.

<F P=106> [Article by correspondent Takehiko Yokoyama: "Japan-China </F>
Relations May Step on Thin Ice"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 9 Jan -- Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata returned to Japan on the evening of 9 
January after winding up his two-day visit to China. During a 
series of talks with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li 
Peng, and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, the Japanese foreign 
minister, taking advantage of the good state of Japan-China 
relations, sought a candid exchange of views with the Chinese 
leaders on China's growing military spending. In response, on 
many occasions during the series of talks, the Chinese leaders 
simply reiterated the country's basic stance, giving the 
impression anew that although Japan-China relations are said to 
be in a "mature stage," relations may be "stepping on thin ice." 
  Commenting on Foreign Minister Hata's visit to China, the 
Foreign Ministry said: "The foreign minister had a broad-ranging 
exchange of views with the Chinese leaders on building a 
future-oriented relationship between the two countries looking 
toward the 21st century." The Foreign Ministry has said that 
Japan intends to help enhance security in the Asia-Pacific 
region through an exchange of military information between the 
two countries. The Foreign Ministry also has said that the 
foreign minister's visit to China was to lay the groundwork for 
Prime Minister Hosokawa's visit to China, scheduled for this 
spring. 
  For the Chinese Government, meanwhile, Japan's cooperation 
with China in the areas of technology and economy is 
indispensable for China to continue its policy of reform and 
opening up. China intends to strengthen relations with Japan at 
a time when Sino-U.S. relations remain unstable with the aim of 
keeping the United States in check. Maintaining good relations 
between Japan and China is in the interests of the two countries. 
  During the series of talks with the Chinese leaders, Foreign 
Minister Hata candidly pointed out that China's neighbors are 
concerned about its moves for military buildup and that China 
needs to disclose military information. 
  In response, President Jiang Zemin devoted a substantial 
amount of time to explaining the current state of China's armed 
forces, but his explanations did not add anything to previous 
explanations and lacked specifics. There is little possibility 
that China will go along with the Japanese foreign minister's 
request for disclosure of military information, and a security 
dialogue between the two countries that Japan has sought is not 
likely to proceed smoothly in the future. 
  The Taiwan issue drew attention during Mr. Hata's stay in 
Beijing. Taiwan's economy has grown dramatically, and China has 
become deeply concerned about Japan's rapid response to this 
development. 
  Commenting on the Taiwan issue at a news conference in a 
Beijing hotel on 9 January, Foreign Minister Hata said: "Taiwan 
has grown remarkably, and it has become a nation that Japan 
cannot ignore. Both China and Taiwan, however, reject the 
concept of `two Chinas,' and Japan supports their positions. 
Japan intends to honor the Japan-China Joint Communique." In 
this way, the foreign minister reiterated that Japan will 
confine its contacts with Taiwan to economic exchanges. Foreign 
Minister Hata also ruled out the possibility of cabinet members 
visiting Taiwan, which China has vehemently opposed. 
  Since Japan-China relations are entering a stage where they 
can candidly discuss a variety of issues, a "rift" between the 
two countries is surfacing in visible form. A senior Foreign 
Ministry official says: "Japan-China relations remain very good. 
But the attitude of China is such that it may unexpectedly 
initiate changes in these ties. Postwar issues between the two 
countries remain unresolved, and we do not know when those 
issues might explode."

<F P=106> [By correspondent Izumi Oshima: "Tokyo Intends To Bolster </F>
Its Say With Beijing"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 8 Jan -- Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime 
minister and foreign minister, and Qian Qichen, Chinese deputy 
premier and foreign minister, held talks on 8 January in which 
they agreed that both Japan and China will shift the fourth set 
of yen-based loans from the conventional, medium five- to 
seven-year formula to a new, short three-year formula. Japan's 
yen-based loans to China have been Japan's most powerful 
diplomatic card to play with China, which is a "political 
power." The Japanese Government seems to have intended to 
shorten the renewal period of the loans to maintain a say in 
pending issues in Asia because China is seeking to use its 
influence in clearing up the issue of North Korea's suspected 
nuclear development program, settling the issue of democracy in 
Hong Kong, and the issue of Japan-Taiwan relations. 
  With regard to the shortened period of the fourth set of 
yen-based loans, a source traveling with the foreign minister 
pointed out that: 1) With the five-year formula, Japan would be 
unable to deal with China's drastically changing economic 
situation and exchange rates; and 2) Other Asian nations have 
been complaining about Japan's "special treatment" of China in 
granting that country the five-year formula. 
  The meaning of Japan's yen-based loans to China is that from 
an official posture, Japan cooperates economically with China's 
reform and opening policy, and from a spiritual standpoint, 
Japan provides China with the loans as "Japan's postwar 
reparations." It can be said that this is a good time for the 
Japanese Government to alter the conventional practice because 
of the nonexistence of major issues currently pending between 
the two countries. 
  Although the same source said that Japanese-Chinese 
relations 
are at their best level compared to any time in recent years, 
Japan's diplomatic influence on China remains limited. Japan 
announced its decision to unfreeze the yen-based loans to China, 
which had been isolated from the rest of the world following the 
Tiananmen incident in 1989. At the G-7 summit talks, Japan has 
championed China. Whether Japan's attitude has served to 
increase its influence on China remains questionable.

  [Text] Four companies -- NEC [Nippon Electric Company] 
Corporation, Fujitsu, Hitachi, and the Oki Electric Industry 
Company -- will begin producing cellular phones in China. In 
China, where the telecommunications network infrastructure is 
underdeveloped, the demand for mobile communications is 
expanding very rapidly as means of communication supplementing 
the telephone networks. Given the situation, the companies are 
eager to start producing the cellular phones in joint-venture 
projects as early as this year. European and U.S. companies are 
already operating in China's cellular phone market, with the 
U.S. firm Motorola holding 60 percent of the market. As for 
Japan, its biggest cellular phone manufacturer, the Matsushita 
Communication Industrial Company, is getting ready to start up 
its local production in the spring. With the four other 
Japanese companies following, intense competition is likely to 
flare up among Japanese and U.S. companies. 
  NEC plans to set up a joint-venture company in China during 
the first half of this year and to begin production by the fall. 
As a production base, Wuhan is considered to be most desirable. 
The initial scale of production by the company is to be 10,000 
sets a month. 
  Fujitsu wants to begin producing its cellular phones within 
this year at Nanjing Fujitsu (in Nanjing), which is a joint 
venture company set up in 1992 to produce optical communications 
systems. It has not decided on the scale of its production, but 
once demand expands, Fujitsu says it "will think about setting 
up a new joint venture company." 
  Hitachi and Oki Electric Industrial are now holding talks 
[with China] with the intention of producing locally their 
cellular phones. While they have yet to negotiate on details, 
they are likely to be able to set up new companies and start 
producing within this year. Oki Electric Industrial probably 
will set up its production base in Shanghai. 
  The number of China's cellular phones is said to have been 
less than 1 million at the end of 1992. But China is a country 
where less than 2 percent of people have ordinary phones. 
Therefore, the demand for mobile communications systems like 
cellular phones and pagers is growing rapidly. The total market 
for the systems was half a million sets in 1993, and it is 
expected to increase to nearly 1 million sets in 1994. 
  The number of subscribers to cellular phones in Japan is 
about 2 million at present. An officer of a major 
communications equipment manufacturer said, "The potential 
demand in Japan cannot come even close to that of China." Thus, 
that Japanese industry's venture into China is likely to 
increase. 
  As far as pagers -- which are becoming as popular as the 
cellular phones are -- are concerned, the Matsushita 
Communication Industrial Co. is now engaged in local production 
at its joint venture company set up in Beijing in June 1992. In 
addition, NEC and the Casio Computer Co. are set to begin 
production at their joint venture companies soon.

<F P=106> [From the "Revolutionary Concepts" column: "Trust Beats </F>
Weapons--Japanese and Chinese Officers To Open Dialogue"] 
  [Text] The "Leak" Is Welcomed? 
  On 20 December, Sino-Japanese working-level talks were held 
in Beijing on security issues. At the beginning of the talks, 
the Japanese delegation was surprised when Chinese officials 
hinted they would welcome a "leak" of topics to be discussed at 
the bilateral talks. An official said: "While Asian nations 
used to feel the `Japan threat,' this is now being replaced by 
the `China threat.' We would like to explain our policy 
thoroughly, and to obtain Asia's understanding. Japan can 
explain us to other nations." During the talks, the Chinese 
officials repeated their assertion: "We are just trying to 
maintain the minimum military strength for national defense." 
However, the Japanese Government conveyed the Chinese 
standpoint to the Asian nations through diplomatic channels. 
  In January, Japan and China agreed to hold the first 
security 
talks between the Defense Agency and Chinese Defense Ministry in 
Beijing in February. Japan feels bad about its wartime 
aggression, and China is changing through rapid economic growth 
under the opening-up policy. The two nations are going to open 
up military exchanges for the first time in the 50 years since 
World War II. In post-Cold War Asia, the two nations are 
beginning to seek new security relations. 
  The Sino-Japanese security talks by defense authorities were 
advocated by the Defense Agency. Last November, (former) 
Director General of the Defense Agency Keisuke Nakanishi 
secretly told (former) U.S. Defense Secretary Les Aspin: "As 
director general of the Defense Agency, I would like to visit 
China. I want to go there as soon as possible -- probably 
during the cherry blossom season." In reply, Aspin said: "That 
is a good idea. But we would like you to inform us of what 
China says." Nakanishi's true intentions are seen in the 1993 
defense white paper. 
  The 1993 white paper has a new section entitled: "Efforts To 
Establish a New Security Environment." In this section, the 
paper notes "promotion of international exchanges with foreign 
military officials will directly deepen mutual understanding 
with these nations." And it stresses "further promotion of 
dialogue is needed" especially for security in the Asia and 
Pacific region. In view of the presence of various ethnic and 
religious groups, the Defense Agency has a plan to establish 
regional security through a network of bilateral exchanges with 
various nations, rather than a multinational agreement. In this 
sense, China is the biggest target to achieve this objective. 
  The security policy of postwar Japan has been promoted under 
a liberal interpretation of the peace constitution. Even under 
such circumstances, the Defense Agency and Self-Defense Forces 
[SDF] have always been "bit players" in the nation's postwar 
history. Although the SDF's role in UN peacekeeping operations 
has been positively discussed since the Gulf war, the conclusion 
of the cold war has led the world into an era of disarmament to 
enjoy the "dividends of peace." The significance of the Defense 
Agency is now in question since the Hosokawa administration 
pledged an SDF scale-down through reviewing the nation's defense 
buildup plan. 
<H5>  Security Is Ensured Through Exchanges </H5>
  What is the role of the "outlawry-of-war forces" in national 
security in the new era? In reply to the question, the Defense 
Agency is preparing the following answer: "To ensure national 
security, exchanges of military officials should be promoted to 
deepen mutual confidence with neighboring nations." The agency 
is seeking Japan's initiative in confidence-building efforts in 
Asia to overcome the trend of SDF rationalization. 
  Since the Tiananmen Square incident, China has been seeking 
better ties with neighboring nations, such as the ROK and SRV. 
However, these Asian nations are becoming wary of China's naval 
force buildup and policy for the Spratly and Paracels Islands. 
  In this regard, the Defense Agency believes China will deal 
positively in security talks with Japan. A top agency official 
said he wants to hold talks on a regular basis, and noted: "The 
Chinese military authorities have close relations with the CPC 
leadership. That is why we attach importance to rerect dialogue 
with the Chinese Defense Ministry." 
  The Defense Agency already has frequent exchanges with 
most Asian nations except China. The National Defense Academy 
and staff colleges of the Ground, Maritime, and Air SDF 
currently have 315 foreign-national students from 14 countries, 
including the ROK and Thailand. In return, some Air SDF 
officers are scheduled to study at the ROK air staff college 
this year. 
  The National Institute for Defense Studies also receives 
military officials of Asian nations to dispel their suspicion 
that "Japan may again step onto the trail of past wrongdoing." 
As one of the guests, vice commandant of the Philippines 
National Defense Academy said: "I have learned Japanese people 
are not jingoistic." 
<H5>  Seeking the Initiative </H5>
  Senior Defense Agency officials noted that international 
exchanges in this field are helpful to obtain neighboring 
nations' understanding of Japan's prudent defense policy, 
saying: "As a major economic power, Japan is certainly qualified 
to take the initiative in confidence-building efforts in Asia." 
  On the other hand, international politics analyst Kazuhisa 
Ogawa said: "National security should be discussed in view of 
not only military affairs, but also food and energy policies. 
For example, Malaysia has a think tank called the Institute for 
International Policies. The institute has policymaking 
authority superior to the Defense Ministry and other government 
agencies. But Japan has no mechanism which overcomes 
bureaucratic sectionalism. The Defense Agency should not 
believe it can take the initiative in Asia without help from 
other government agencies." 
  Mutual trust between military officials is superior to the 
deterrent force of ultramodern weapons--will Asia accept such a 
proposal made by a nation with a peace constitution?

  [Text] Kunihiko Saito, administrative vice minister for 
foreign affairs, commented on the issue of visits to Taiwan by 
Japanese cabinet members and other government officials at a 
press conference on 10 January. Saito said: "There has been no 
change in our basic policy of abiding by the principles and 
spirit of the Japan-China Joint Communique; that is, relations 
with Taiwan will be limited to areas other than political. In 
line with this policy, we will decide on each individual visit 
after looking carefully at the substance of the visit and other 
relevant factors." This is believed to leave the possibility 
open for visits by high-ranking government officials in 
connection with economic issues or international conferences. 
  Touching on a statement made by Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime 
minister and foreign minister, at a news conference in Beijing 
negating the possibility of cabinet members visiting Taiwan, 
Saito said: "This was in reply to the question `will there be 
visits to Taiwan in the near future, for instance, before the 
end of 1994?' It did not mean anything more than that." He 
indicated that the foreign minister's remark would not restrain 
visits by cabinet ministers to Taiwan in the future.

  [Text] Regarding UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali's report to the Security Council recommending a 
stop to efforts to disarm the fighting forces in Somalia by the 
use of force by UN troops, and switching to a more conventional 
type of PKO [peacekeeping operations], a senior Foreign Ministry 
official reacted calmly, claiming "this has been expected 
because the United States and other countries have expressed 
their wish to withdraw." 
  The government has, so far, shown understanding of the idea 
of "peace enforcement force," although "due to constitutional 
constraints, it would not be possible for Japan to participate." 
As a nonpermanent member of the Security Council, Japan has 
approved of the dispatch of forces to Somalia and the former 
Yugoslavia. 
  Therefore, it is interesting to see how the report will 
affect PKO in the former Yugoslavia, which has also been 
authorized to take action as a peace enforcement force similar 
to Somalia. 
  Some members of the Liberal Democratic Party and Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party] believe that if it is under UN command, 
Japan can also participate in peace enforcement forces. 
  However, right now, the government is even constrained in 
its 
participation in conventional PKO because the PKO Cooperation 
Law freezes participation in UN peacekeeping forces (PKF). The 
senior Foreign Ministry official said, "This report is not 
expected to affect Japan's policy on PKO." 
  A more active debate on the use of force in PKO is expected 
to occur in light of the Butrus-Ghali report. In anticipation 
of a review of the PKO Cooperation Law in the future, this 
report will certainly create a stir in the domestic debate on UN 
intervention in regional conflicts.

  [Text] Following a decision at the new multilateral trade 
negotiations (Uruguay Round) to lower the tariff rate on beef, a 
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF] source 
disclosed on 8 January that Japan had reached an agreement with 
beef-exporting nations, including the United States and 
Australia, regarding a new safeguard (emergency import 
restriction) which Japan can apply when beef imports increase 
rapidly. Reportedly, Australia, which is a beef-exporting 
nation, basically approves. Since requirements for its 
application will be eased, and definite action can be taken, the 
MAFF hopes it will be able to minimize the adverse affect to 
cattle farmers of lowering the tariff rate. 
  Currently, a 50-percent tariff is charged on beef but it 
will 
be reduced to 38.5 percent during the six years starting in 
1995, thanks to the agreement at the new round. 
  Under the new safeguard, Japan will be able to increase the 
tariff rate to 50 percent, which is the current rate, if an 
import amount, calculated on the basis of beef imports for every 
quarter period, increases by 17 percent or more compared to that 
of the same quarter of the previous year. Under the current 
safeguard, which was introduced under a Japan-U.S. accord in 
1988, the tariff rate can be increased by 25 percent if the 
annual import quantity grows by 20 percent or more. Domestic 
cattle farmers are critical of the current safeguard, saying 
that "requirements for its application are severe and it is not 
a definite measure." 
  Moreover, the new safeguard can be applied to chilled and 
frozen beef separately. 
  However, the reality is that the quantity of imported beef 
is 
rapidly increasing even though the tariff rate is 50 percent. 
Moreover, it seems that cattle farmers may have doubts about the 
effect of the new safeguard should primary factors of beef 
import expansion, including further appreciation of the yen, be 
felt.

  [Text] U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, cabinet 
members, and other high-ranking U.S. Government officials have 
recently spoken out against depreciating the yen and 
appreciating the dollar. Commenting on their remarks at a news 
conference on 10 January, Gaishi Hiraiwa, president of Keidanren 
[Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan], said: "While a 
strong yen will delay Japan's economic recovery, a weak yen will 
end the current asset deflation and strong yen-caused deflation. 
I believe the weak yen is in the interests of the United 
States." In this way, he implicitly attacked the U.S. 
Government. Asserting: "It is undesirable that exchange rates 
fluctuate because of the remarks of specific individuals," 
President Hiraiwa said definitely: "Given the U.S. economic 
recovery, the yen can be depreciated a little more." 
  Touching on stimulus measures at the news conference, 
Hiraiwa 
stressed: "It is necessary to cut more than 5 trillion yen in 
income taxes prior to raising the consumption tax and to issue 
national bonds to make up for the fiscal shortfall resulting 
from the income tax reduction." As for handling the consumption 
tax, he said: "The idea is surfacing that if the income tax and 
consumption tax are cut and raised simultaneously, it will serve 
to stimulate the economy by increasing demand; this idea is 
reasonable." Thus, Hiraiwa expressed his understanding of the 
tax cut and tax increase package the Finance Ministry has 
broached. As for the lead time of the income tax reduction 
prior to the consumption tax hike, President Hiraiwa said: "I 
cannot say lightly whether 15 months (under study by the 
government) is desirable or not." 
  Referring to the argument for lowering the official discount 
rate, President Hiraiwa indicated his opposition to lowering the 
rate, saying: "Many people are pointing increasingly to its 
adverse impact on the economy."

  [Text] The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and 
Fisheries [MAFF] has decided to provide rice-exporting 
countries, including Thailand and China, with technological 
assistance in the fields of rice production and distribution. 
This is in response to the government's decision to partially 
open the rice market. The action is being taken because, if 
Japan fails to procure rice from exporting countries in line 
with its plan, it will affect its supply and demand policy. To 
promote stable rice shipments, MAFF plans to provide 
technological aid to rice exporters in such fields as planting 
rice intended for exports, controlling rice fields by the 
harvesting season, and storing harvested rice. Moreover, in 
line with rice exporters' requests, MAFF plans to instruct them 
in the technology for producing rice that will suit the taste of 
the Japanese people. 
  Following the agricultural agreement under GATT's 
multilateral trade negotiations (Uruguay Round), Japan must 
accept rice imports of 4 percent (approximately 380,000 tons) of 
annual domestic consumption in fiscal 1995 in return for a 
six-year moratorium on rice import tariffication. Moreover, it 
must increase the rate of rice imports gradually to procure rice 
of 8 percent (approximately 760,000 tons) of domestic 
consumption from foreign countries in six years. 
  MAFF has judged that, to help rice-exporting countries 
maintain stable production of rice intended for export to Japan, 
it is necessary to instruct them in rice-producing methods such 
as cultivation technology for planting rice, using agricultural 
chemicals, and rice field controlling technology for securing 
the steady growth of rice plants. Moreover, MAFF plans to 
support rice exporters with the technology for storage and 
transport control to prevent rice from declining in quality 
after being harvested so that the rice can pass Japan's strict 
quality test. 
  MAFF's decision is based on its fear that because the amount 
of the world's annual rice trade is small, reaching more than 10 
million yen, a possible drastic change in exporting countries' 
production may hinder Japan's rice procurement. Recently, mold 
or alien substances such as pebbles were found in Thai-grown 
rice imported by Japan as an emergency measure to counter last 
year's poor rice crop. When such cases are taken into 
consideration, it is necessary to review the system for 
controlling the process of distribution. 
  China, Thailand, and other countries are expected to be 
listed as recipient countries for technological aid. MAFF will 
study a possibility of providing technological aid to 
rice-producing countries, including the SRV and Burma. It will 
decide on recipient countries and work out concrete details of 
the plan. MAFF intends to begin providing technological aid 
during fiscal 1994.

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] announced on 10 January that it will start to phase out 
the wide-ranging voluntary export restraint [VER] governing 
textile exports to the United States, the European Union (EU), 
and Southeast Asia in 1994. It plans to reduce export permit 
applications, numbering 310,000 annually at present, to 50,000 
in 1995, representing an 84-percent cut. 
  The agreement reached at the new multilateral trade 
negotiations (the Uruguay Round) provides for the abolition of 
the VER on textiles in 10 years. The MITI has decided to do 
away with the VER ahead of schedule. 
  Japan continued to impose the VER even after the Japan-U.S. 
textile agreement (1974-1991) and the multilateral fiber 
agreement (MFA) had expired "to avoid friction." However, Japan 
made the decision to end the restriction because it has now 
become an importer of textiles, and its textile exports cannot 
compete with those of developing countries. 
  In concrete terms, numerical quotas for exports to the 
United 
States and the EU, except for certain synthetic fibers, will be 
scrapped by the end of 1994, switching to a simple export permit 
system. The VER covers 95 percent of Japanese textile exports 
to the United States. MITI plans to reduce this to 28 percent 
of the total by 1995. 
  Furthermore, the following steps will be taken to promote 
eventual complete liberalization: 1) The permit system will be 
abolished for textile exports to Southeast Asia by the end of 
1994; 2) exports to Canada will move from numerical restrictions 
to a permit system in 1994, and the permit system will also be 
scrapped by the end of 1994; and 3) the permit system will be 
abolished for exports to East Europe and the Middle East by the 
end of 1994.

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] has decided to extend government subsidies to provide 
more money to funds set up by leather industry organizations to 
help stabilize the domestic industry. The move has been made in 
response to an agreement Japan made with the United States and 
European nations at GATT's new round of multilateral trade talks 
(Uruguay Round), which was concluded late last year. In the 
trade talks, these nations demanded Japan lower its tariffs on 
leather and leather shoes. MITI plans to request a total 4.8 
billion yen allocation from the fiscal year 1994 budget. 
  Concerning tariffs on leather and leather shoes, Japan 
currently imposes a preliminary tariff of 15-27 percent on 
import volumes under a certain limit and a secondary tariff of 
60 percent on those above this limit. This high tariff rate is 
designed to protect the domestic leather industry. However, 
Japan agreed with other GATT member nations at the Uruguay Round 
talks to reduce preliminary and secondary tariff rates on such 
products by 20 and 50 percent, respectively. Consequently, it 
is expected that imports will now increase and domestic 
businesses will face hard times. 
  As a step to help stabilize domestic businesses, the Japan 
Federation of Leather Industries and Japan Tanners' Association 
have separately set up funds. Firms belonging to the two 
organizations have used profits made through utilization of the 
funds to finance research and development of new technologies. 
So far, MITI has extended a total of over 7 billion yen to the 
two funds since the tariff quota system was introduced.

  [Text] As part of the new pump-priming package which will 
be announced in mid-January, the government will provide 
additional housing loans to 50,000 to 70,000 households. To 
raise funds for the program, expenditures for public investments 
will be added by over 1 trillion yen in the supplementary budget 
for fiscal 1993. In line with the tax cut plans for those who 
repair or change their houses, the government intends to offer 
the housing loan program as a centerpiece of the pump-priming 
package. Since the Japanese economy is still "fluctuating," (as 
noted by the Economic Planning Agency), the government wants to 
maintain high levels of housing investments. 
  In the initial 1993 budget, the Housing Loan Corporation 
[HLC] provided a loans for 550,000 households. After that, the 
government hammered out pump-primming packages twice in April 
and September 1993, and expanded the quota by 50,000 and 
100,000, respectively. As a result, the HLC loans became 
available for 700,000 households this fiscal year, and this was 
an unprecedented level. 
  Yet, applicants are eagerly filling the expanded quota 
because of low interest rates. Under such circumstances, the 
government has decided to further promote housing policy by 
drastically expanding the loan quota. This is because promotion 
of housing policies is in accord with "consumer-oriented" 
political posture of the Hosokawa administration. 
  The government is planning to offer housing loans to 50,000 
to 70,000 more households in the supplementary 1993 budget. 
When the Construction Ministry made the fiscal 1994 budget 
request last August, the quota for the housing loans in 1994 was 
set at 560,000 households. However, Construction Minister Kozo 
Igarashi recently said that he intends to expand the quota to 
"over 600,000." In this regard, the size of the 1993 
supplementary budget is expected to be finalized in view of the 
1994 HLC program.

  [Text] On 2 January, the government and the ruling 
coalition parties decided to start reviewing the land price tax, 
induced in 1992 to curb the rise in land prices, promote 
effective utilization of land, and to partially lower the land 
price tax. They will introduce a new rule to cut the tax 
one-third to one-fourth its current level. The areas covered by 
the tax reduction will include open space and green belts opened 
to the public and land used for public parking lots. Details of 
the new rule will be ironed out in the process of reforming the 
tax system for fiscal 1994 and will be retroactive to January 
1994. Although the fundamental tax rate (0.3 percent) will be 
maintained, some businesses that own wooded land helpful for 
enhancing the environment in the center of major urban areas, 
where land prices are high, will be eligible for a land tax cut 
of over 30 percent. Since the recession continues to drag on, 
real estate firms and distribution businesses are calling more 
than before for the tax cut. However, it seems that a 
relaxation of the tax will have actual and psychological impacts 
on the economy's stimulation as well. 
  Areas covered by the tax reduction include: 1) land used for 
public parking lots; 2) land open to the public and therefore 
having high public interest; 3) green belts inside factory lots 
and other areas helpful for enhancing the environment; and 4) 
land covered by regional comprehensive city planning. The 
government plans to reduce land price tax on public parking lots 
and land open to the public from one-third to one-fourth its 
current level depending on the degree of how much they are used 
by the public or needed for public interests. 
  The revision is aimed at mitigating the burden of the land 
price tax to help promote the quality of life-oriented policies 
launched by the Hosokawa administration, while maintaining the 
tax's main purpose of achieving effective use of land and 
curbing land price increases. It is mainly designed to 
substantially reduce the tax on land in metropolitan areas, 
where many public parking lots and open spaces exist. 
  Distribution businesses, which operate in metropolitan areas 
on the basis of city planning, will benefit most from the lower 
tax rates. It is expected that some companies will be able to 
make more than a 30 percent cut. The government and the 
coalition parties are making final coordinations to incorporate 
land mobilization measures [tochi ryudoka taisaku], including 
partial easing of the tax on profits made from land sales, into 
the business stimulation package to be worked out in 
mid-January. Land is taxed at 0.3 percent of its value 
(estimated value of inheritance tax) as of 1 January each year. 
The government expects the revenue from the land price tax for 
fiscal 1993 to reach 623 billion yen. However, the government 
charges no tax on the land, which costs less than 30,000 yen per 
one square meter or below one billion in total (1.5 billion yen 
when they are owned by individuals or minor business 
enterprises). Because of this, there was severe criticism that 
the tax was a major burden for business enterprises -- 
particularly real estate firms, distribution businesses and 
financial institutions, which own large lots of land or stores 
in the center of major urban areas where land prices are high. 
  Moreover, some companies pointed out that the purpose of the 
land tax was achieved to some extent when the bubble economy 
collapsed. In addition, these companies were dissatisfied with 
the possibility that 1994 revaluation of fixed assets is 
expected to increase their tax burdens. Therefore, they were 
strongly urging the government to review the land price tax from 
a viewpoint of mapping out economic measures as well.

  [Text] The government has drawn up the outline of a policy 
to lift a ban on business corporations purchasing their own 
outstanding stocks. The (justice minister's advisory) 
Legislative Council is now working on a revision to the 
Commercial Law, and as part of the law's revision, is planning 
to allow businesses to purchase their own stocks in an effort to 
reduce the volume of issued stocks. Under the policy, companies 
would be allowed to buy up to 3 percent of their own outstanding 
shares on condition they cancel the shares within six months. 
The Finance Ministry intends to prepare rules on procedures for 
and disclosure of the purchases. The Justice and Finance 
Ministries are expected to work out new rules before February. 
The ban that prohibits the purchase of a corporation's own 
stocks is expected to be rescinded in April 1995 after a 
revision of related laws. 
  Industrial circles and securities firms have been calling 
for 
the stimulation of the stock market through lifting the ban. 
The bill revising the Commercial Law will have provisions to 
allow companies to buy their own stocks for cancellation or 
distribution to employees. 
  The Legislative Council has been studying measures for 
partial liberalization of the ban, noting: "A full 
liberalization will threaten companies' financial status because 
it entails returning money to shareholders." 
  The funds used by a company to purchase its own stocks will 
be limited to dividend funds, and the purchase will have to be 
approved in advance at the shareholders' general meeting. The 
maximum volume of purchases will be set at 3 percent to prevent 
management attempts to strengthen its control over the company, 
and to avoid ill effects on the stock market. 
  Companies that buy their own stocks will have to cancel them 
within a certain period. To minimize the possibility of 
influencing the shareholders' general meetings, the period for 
which a corporation will be permitted to possess its own stocks 
will be set at a maximum of six months. When purchased stocks 
are canceled, companies will again be allowed to buy their own 
stocks, up to 3 percent. 
  Stock purchases for distribution to employees is planned 
because stock purchases by employees often causes instability in 
stock prices. Stock purchases for cancellation is planned to 
improve the balance between demand and supply of stocks. Many 
companies increased their capital during the bubble economy 
boom, and the resulting stock oversupply is regarded as one of 
the reasons for the stock market's prolonged slump. 
  In line with the preparatory work for the Commercial Law's 
revision, the Finance Ministry will develop rules to govern a 
company purchasing its own stocks. The ministry plans to make 
it mandatory for businesses wishing to buy their own shares to 
do so through the stock market and to disclose their purchases 
before and after the transaction. The ministry is trying to 
restrict the scale to which a company will be able to purchase 
its own stocks to avoid ill influences on the stock market -- 
this is aimed at investor protection. 
  As tangible measures, the Finance Ministry intends to 
control 
the quantity of purchases through the following restrictions: 
1) The volume of purchases per day should not exceed 25-30 
percent of the average volume of transactions in the market; 2) 
purchases must be done through one securities company; 3) 
purchases should not be done immediately before the close of the 
market; and 4) company purchases of its own stock should be 
prohibited when doing so might push the price of the stock to an 
unprecedented level. 
  Regarding disclosure measures, the Finance Ministry is 
expected to urge companies to clarify at the shareholders' 
general meetings when, how many, and at what price it purchased 
its own stocks. Even after the purchase, companies will be 
urged to report when and how many stocks they purchased and at 
what price.

<F P=106> [Article by editorial staff member Keiko Ito: "Outcome of </F>
Factional Wrangling in `Declining MITI'"] 
  [Text] Yuji Tanahashi (59), former administrative vice 
minister at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
(MITI), who retired in June 1993 was referred to as an "emperor" 
within the ministry. Comments by people who knew him follow. 
  "Among the successive vice ministers, he was extraordinarily 
skillful at making a connection with the Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP]." 
  "He was skillful at making allies of the politicians, when 
there were inter-ministerial power struggles." 
  The factional wrangling within the ministry surrounding this 
Mr. Tanahashi seems to have cast a shadow on the incident in 
which MITI Minister Hiroshi Kumagai advised Industrial Policy 
Bureau Director Masahisa Naito (55) to resign on grounds of the 
"spoils system." 
  The struggle between the "Tanahashi faction" and the 
"anti-Tanahashi faction" is said to have intensified over the 
last three or four years. 
  In July 1993, copies of a mysterious document, claiming to 
be 
signed by "all concerned junior officers in MITI" and 
criticizing Mr. Tanahashi were sent to current senior officials 
and to "OB's" [former officials] and were printed in some of the 
weekly magazines. 
  There was also past factional wrangling in MITI in 1963, 
during the time of the Ikeda cabinet, surrounding selection of a 
successor for Mr. Shigeru Saji (now deceased) who was then 
called "Mr. MITI." Mr. Nobuyoshi Namiki, an economist who 
retired as a result of his involvement in that struggle and who 
wrote The End of MITI, comments: 
  "Since about that time, the office's power had been 
decreasing, and we were losing work. The senior officials 
seemed to be spending their energy on the factional fight and to 
be less concerned about the work itself. Such an atmosphere 
prepared the ground for the current incident." 
  There are even rumors that some senior officials, until 
recently, formed a "club of people who live along the Toyoko 
[Railroad] Line up to XX Station," a "MITI Ladies Club," and had 
meetings with those subordinate officials who participated. 
  There are people concerned who unhappily say: 
  "During the Sahashi period, there was still some semblance 
of 
policy argument. Today, it is just a personnel struggle." 
<H5>  Promoted the Eldest Son Seven Years Early </H5>
  The favoritism in personnel affairs which became an issue 
developed during the time Mr. Tanahashi was vice minister. They 
transferred Tanahashi's eldest son, Yasufumi (30), who entered 
MITI in 1987 while his father was director of the Secretariat, 
from deputy head of section to a newly created position of 
planning advisor in the minister's Secretariat in December 1992. 
  This [promotion] was said to have been seven years earlier 
than [promotions] for people who entered the ministry the same 
year as he. 
  Yasufumi [Tanahashi] resigned a week later, in January 1993, 
ran in the July general election from the first district for the 
House of Representative in Gifu Prefecture, and lost. His 
father, who retired from MITI, stuck closely by his only son and 
campaigned during the election. 
  The father of Mrs. Yuji [Tanahashi] is Koko Matsuno, 
[former] 
representative from the first district of Gifu and former 
director general of the National Land Agency. At one time it 
was rumored that Mr. Tanahashi himself might eventually try for 
political office. 
  Bureau Director General Naito was, during the time of 
Tanahashi's vice ministership, the chief of the Secretariat. He 
supported the vice minister and was accused of playing a part in 
the favoritism in personnel affairs. He was urged to resign by 
the minister on 16 December and submitted his resignation on the 
22d. The director of industrial policy is at the head of the 
list of director generals, and was the candidate most likely to 
become the next vice minister. 
  Mr. Naito was thought to be close to Mr. Tanahashi. But Mr. 
Kozo Watanabe, who is the alternate representative secretary for 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the party to which MITI 
Minister Kumagai also belongs, and who is himself a former MITI 
minister, comments: 
  "He kept his distance from politicians and served earnestly, 
regardless of who his superior was. He was a bureaucrat-like 
bureaucrat." 
<H5>  Cabinet Minister Exercises Authority and Causes Commotion </H5>
  Cabinet ministers have the right to appoint and dismiss 
bureaucrats. It is legal and justifiable for a cabinet officer 
to dismiss a director general based on his own judgment. But 
when this incident was reported, there was a great commotion in 
Kasumigaseki [government sector of Tokyo]. 
  That is because the fact that a cabinet minister would 
[actually] exercise his authority and would regard pre-election 
favoritism in personnel affairs as inappropriate was all 
contrary to "custom in Kasumigaseki." 
  Director Naito himself continued to resist [dismissal] for 
nearly one week, saying: "Why do I have to resign (only for such 
a minor matter)?" When Mr. Naito's post-resignation press 
conference was aired, in a certain office in the ministry young 
staff members shouted loudly "what is this minister thinking 
of?" "We just cannot have the whims of a new minister, who does 
not know anything, influence our personnel." 
  Mr. Watanabe himself once tried to make up a personnel 
chart while he was MITI minister. 
  The personnel proposals subsequently brought to him by the 
[administrative] vice minister and chief of secretariat matched 
99 percent with those Mr. Watanabe had devised. 
  He takes an affirmative view of the custom, saying: "It is 
the bureaucrats' wisdom gained from long experience that catches 
the minister's feeling and the [LDP] party's atmosphere through 
day-to-day contact, so they can come up with appropriate 
personnel. It is not that the ministers are controlled by the 
bureaucrats." 
  Mr. Kumagai is a former MITI official. He gave the notice to 
Mr. Naito, who entered the ministry three years ahead of him, 
with language along the lines of: "I am dismissing you according 
to the new cabinet's policy." He was saying that he wanted to 
correct bad practices such as favoritism in personnel which had 
been normal during the LDP era. 
  He stressed during the [news] conference that "(favoritism 
in 
personnel matters) is inappropriate when one looks at it with 
general common sense." 
  Many of the concerned MITI officials agreed that a number of 
similar personnel actions occurred in the past, and very few 
questioned such a "practice." 
  "That much should be permissible for people who run for 
elective office, as a gift from MITI" (former official). "They 
quit immediately after receiving the promotion, so there was no 
real harm" (former official). 
  Mr. Naito too did not conceal his resentment at the news 
conference, saying: "It is as if I am being executed for a minor 
offense." 
  For the past week, some volunteer former MITI officials 
filed 
into the administrative vice minister's office and pressed the 
vice minister to refuse the minister's demand. Senior officials 
still in service sent an open letter of questions to the 
minister. The commotion expanded. 
<H5>  Glory Is Declining and.... </H5>
  People in the United States Trade Representative's Office 
(USTR) called Japan's MITI the "notorious MITI." This was in 
the latter half of the 1970's. 
  It was a nickname given with grudges, but also with some 
wonder. MITI was the locomotive for Japanese industry which, 
while creating friction with other countries, had built up a 
trade surplus. Prior to that, Japan was also called an 
"economic animal," "Japan, Inc." 
  The world thought that all the secrets for achieving that 
surprising economic growth were possessed by MITI. 
  MITI was formerly the Ministry of Agriculture and Industry 
during the Meiji period. In 1925, it became the Ministry of 
Commerce and Industry and for a time during the war was called 
the Ministry of Munitions. After the war, it was reborn as the 
Ministry of Commerce and Industry. In 1949 it became the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry and supported the 
Japanese prosperity which followed. The share of the national 
budget it receives is only 1 percent. Pride that "this is a 
place to work on a national vision, not a bureaucratic office to 
administer subsidies" is said to lead to the staff's sense of 
elitism. 
  One former official reminisced: "I was embarrassed because 
people overrated us, believing that if MITI gave its OK, then 
everything was decided." 
  But as the nation has entered a period of stable growth, the 
current of trade has begun to flow toward liberalization and 
deregulation, and their glory has begun to wane. 
  Now the people concerned are at a loss: "The key phrase is a 
people-oriented country. What is the role for MITI, which has 
single-mindedly pursued production? While the organization has 
expanded, the work keeps decreasing." 
  Mr. Watanabe can not forget the voices of admiration, and 
the 
eager looks he received in meeting halls every time he was 
introduced as the "MITI minister" at parties or when he visited 
Asian countries while he was the MITI minister. 
  "For a while there was a trend that the industries which had 
been nurtured by MITI became independent and said that they no

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, January 11 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The year 
of 1993 was a "bumper" year for owners of private running 
enterprises. The most important thing is that people are 
shifting from the commercial business to productive one. At 
present in Mongolia there are about 30 thousand of private units 
which is evidencing the establishing some grounds for the 
private sector to grow and establish in the country, senior 
secretary of the Mongolian association of owners of privately 
running enterprises B. Sembeejav said in his interview granted 
to the MONTSAME correspondent. 
  In spite of the little assistance and support given to those 
engaged in private businesses on the part of the state and 
government by their market oriented initiativeness such 
private-owned enterprises as "Altan Shagai", "Uldziyt" and 
others managed to find their feet and succeed.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, January 11 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- For 
ensuring a usual activity of the public transport service of the 
Mongolian capital with nearly 600 thousand residents there is 
required more than 490 buses and trolley-buses. According to 
the rough calculations for a partial renovation of the motor 
fleet and purchasing 120 buses it is needed over 3 billion 
tugrik and it is necessary to render urgently proper aid to the 
transport servicemen on the part of appropriate organizations in 
finding such financial resources. 
  Last year in the capital on 21 routes there run about 
160-180 
buses and on 7 routes some 80-85 trolley-buses. The public 
transport service goes on to be the matter of concern of the 
communal service of the Mongolian capital.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 11 KYODO -- Japan has "completely 
lost" to the United States in competitiveness of such leading 
industries as the electrical-electronics and car sectors, a 
leading business official said Tuesday [11 January]. 
  Ryuzaburo Kaku, vice chairman of the Japan Association of 
Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai), told a press conference 
that stepped-up efforts to develop innovative technologies is 
the only way for Japan to recover its competitive edge. 
  "But this takes a few years to do, so the situation will not 
change this year," he said. 
  Kaku, who is also chairman of leading camera maker Canon 
Inc., said U.S. companies have poured much effort into 
improving their production technologies in recent years, while 
dramatically reforming their approaches to management. 
  These steps, he said, have substantially reduced 
manufacturing costs and thereby the prices of their products, 
leaving Japanese-made products less competitive.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- A senior U.S. trade 
negotiator on Wednesday [12 January] urged Tokyo to redouble its 
efforts to improve American access to its markets in line with 
last year's accord to forge a new bilateral trade framework. 
  "By almost any measure, be it the stock of foreign 
investment 
in Japan as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), or the 
import penetration of foreign manufactured goods, Japan's 
economy is markedly less open than any other developed economy," 
said Joan Spero, under secretary of state for economic, business 
and agricultural affairs. 
  Spero is on a four-day visit to Japan to push stalled talks 
on a bilateral trade framework before U.S. President Bill 
Clinton meets Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in 
Washington on February 11. 
  "Quite frankly, progress to date in the talks has been 
disappointing," Spero told a news conference at the Japan 
National Press Club. "We are looking for real results in these 
(framework) talks and not cosmetic agreements." 
  Saying Japan is responsible for 60 percent of the U.S. 
global 
trade deficit, Spero added, "clearly, there is something wrong 
in the basic structure of our economic relationship." 
  "While this imbalance is due in part to broad macroeconomic 
forces, it also is a consequence of the structural relationship 
between Japan and the global economy, and the inadequate market 
access that foreign firms encounter in Japan," she said. 
  Spero dismissed what she views as "repetitive and inaccurate 
claims" going around in pubic debate in Japan in the past few 
months that Washington is seeking specific market share targets. 
  Spero said, "This misinformation, or disinformation, has 
obscured an understanding of the purpose of the framework." 
  She said the framework is aimed at addressing macroeconomic 
imbalances, reducing sectoral and structural barriers and 
promoting an open and freer economy in Japan. 
  During the July 1993 talks between Clinton and then Japanese 
Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, Tokyo committed itself to 
"significantly" decrease its current account surplus and expand 
its global imports of goods and services, she said. 
  In order to correct chronic economic imbalances and market 
access problems, Japan and the United States agreed last July to 
come up with "a variety of qualitative and quantitative 
indicators" to assess whether they are "moving in the right 
direction," Spero said, calling for "results" in specific 
bilateral trade areas like autos and financial services. 
  "These are changes that will benefit not just foreign firms 
but Japanese as well," she said. 
  Elaborating on the indicators as sought by the U.S. under 
the July accord, Spero cited U.S. auto dealers planning to 
operate in Japan. 
  As a quantitative measurement, the number of U.S. auto 
dealerships should increase in Japan, she said. But qualitative 
aspects, such as their location and how they are operated, are 
also important, she added. 
  "The constant portrayal by some Japanese that our framework 
proposals are managed trade is wrong. Our goal is to unmanage 
trade in Japan, not to manage it," she said. 
  It is not time for the two countries to discuss whether or 
not they have agreed to adopt trade measurements but it is time 
for them to "get down and begin serious discussion" on ways to 
open specific markets, she said. 
  Spero voiced hope that ongoing negotiations between Japan's 
ruling coalition parties and the opposition camp on political 
reforms will not hinder progress in Japan-U.S. trade talks.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- The Washington summit 
between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President 
Bill Clinton in February is a crucial step for bilateral trade 
talks, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said Wednesday 
[12 January]. 
  The top government spokesman told a news conference that 
Tokyo "attaches great importance" to the summit, which comes at 
the final stage of framework trade negotiations between the two 
countries. 
  Hosokawa and Clinton are scheduled to meet February 11 in 
Washington to assess the progress of the trade talks, which are 
being held under the Japan-U.S. trade framework accord reached 
last July. 
  Takemura said that in addition to talks on bilateral 
relations, the premier also plans to present Clinton with a 
specific plan to boost the languishing Japanese economy. 
  Hosokawa will likely visit the U.S. capital from February 10 
to 12, Takemura said, adding he had not heard if the Japanese 
leader would confer with Clinton on more than one occasion.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- Japan and the United 
States were at odds Wednesday [12 January] in bilateral trade 
negotiations here over a U.S. demand that Japan set new targets 
for its imports of U.S.-made automotive components, Japanese 
officials said. 
  Vice trade ministers of the two countries kicked off three 
days of talks on auto trade, one of the industrial sectors 
covered by the bilateral "framework" trade negotiations agreed 
on last July. 
  Sources close to the negotiators said Japan adamantly 
rejected the U.S. request, reiterating that too much government 
intervention in the private sector results in managed trade. 
  The U.S. side showed some understanding toward the Japanese 
position, but asserted that the government has a role to play in 
making it easier for U.S. cars to enter the Japanese market, 
the sources said. 
  They said the discrepancy will delay an agreement on the 
talks to next week or after. 
  Meanwhile, Jeffrey Garten, U.S. under secretary of commerce 
for international economic affairs, met personally with Japanese 
makers to persuade them to agree to help increase sales of U.S. 
finished cars in Japan and entry by U.S. firms into the 
country's parts repair industry. 
  A senior official of the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry said later in the day that the bilateral talks will not 
be settled unless the U.S. drops its demand that Japan set 
numerical targets to gauge the openness of Japan's auto market. 
  He noted there were no prospects of growth in the domestic 
demand for motor vehicles. 
  "Under such circumstances, we can't urge domestic automakers 
to buy more parts from U.S. parts suppliers because they have 
shut down some of their factories and imposed tough demands on 
their subcontractors," said the official, who declined to be 
identified.

<F P=106> [By Antonio Kamiya] </F>
  [Text] Washington, Jan. 11 KYODO -- Japanese and U.S. 
officials wrapped up their latest round of "framework" trade 
negotiations on Tuesday [11 January] without narrowing 
differences on any major issues during two days of talks. 
  The two sides agreed to meet again, but officials predicted 
there will likely be no real progress until the "final hours" 
before a summit between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton on February 11. 
  "It is like any negotiation -- you get right up to the final 
edge and most of that will probably be worked out in the final 
hours," said State Department Counselor Tim Wirth. 
  The talks at the U.S. Trade Representative Office centered 
on 
the Japanese insurance market, one of three market sectors 
designated as priority areas in the Japan-U.S. framework 
negotiation process. 
  Mid-level officials from the Japanese Finance Ministry and 
the U.S. Trade Representative Office are trying to put together 
a draft that incorporates both agreement and disagreement for 
further negotiation on a more senior level, Japanese sources 
said. 
  Apart from the huge 300 billion dollar Japanese insurance 
market, the U.S. also wants to increase sales in the Japanese 
automobile market and hike its share of Japanese Government 
purchases of telecommunications and medical equipment. 
  Under a schedule worked out between U.S. and Japanese 
officials, deputy ministers from the two countries will try to 
seek common ground in two more rounds of talks, the first set 
for January 25 to 26 in Washington and the other February 3 to 5 
in Tokyo. 
  So far, one chief difference is over the type of so-called 
"objective criteria" -- a requirement prescribed in the 
framework accord -- for assessing progress of import penetration 
in Japanese markets. 
  Washington has insisted on using the level of imports in 
other group of seven industrial nations as "the norm" for Japan 
to follow. 
  Japanese officials have called the U.S. position 
"unacceptable," saying such measures would amount to setting 
aside a specific market share for foreign goods and services. 
  "In a market economy, the government has no such power," 
said 
a Japanese official who briefed reporters on the latest round of 
framework talks. 
  Japanese officials also expressed dissatisfaction about a 
U.S. refusal to negotiate market access issues in the United 
States, particularly with respect to the U.S. insurance market. 
  Japanese officials insisted that Tokyo has the right to 
raise 
such issues under terms of the framework accord. 
  The agreement, reached last July between Clinton and then 
Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, calls for 
"consultations...under the basic principle of two-way dialogue." 
  "They say that is merely a promise to hold talks, to 
consult, 
but not to negotiate," said a Japanese official, who requested 
that he not be identified. 
  "This is clearly sophistry," he said. 
  Such rhetoric marked an escalation in the war of words 
between Japanese and U.S. Government bureaucrats involved in the 
tenuous trade negotiations between the two trading partners. 
  Last week, Under Secretary of State Joan Spero called 
Japanese trade officials "quite rigid" and accused them of 
spreading "disinformation" on U.S. objectives regarding access 
to Japanese markets. 
  Japanese officials have expressed dismay about what they 
view 
as a U.S. attempt to discredit Japanese bureaucrats. 
  "We are clearly not happy about it, and we told them so," a 
Japanese official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Wednesday [12 January] that Japan has to contain 
the U.S. inclination to retaliate against what it labels as 
unfair traders. 
  Hosokawa made the remarks when he met the heads of Japan's 
four major business lobbies, including Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman 
of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren). 
  During the 90-minute meeting, Hosokawa said, "The United 
States is threatening to use Section 301 (of the 1974 U.S. Trade 
Act) in the bilateral `framework' trade negotiations. 
  "Japan will have to act to contain the move through the 
world 
trade organization, agreed to be established at the Uruguay 
Round of multilateral trade talks" completed in December, he 
said. 
  The premier also reassured business leaders that he will 
reject U.S. demands on Japan to set numerical targets on 
bilateral trade when he meets President Bill Clinton in February 
in Washington. 
  "When we met in Seattle last year, I told the President that 
the Japanese Government cannot make pledges on matters 
concerning the private sector. I will repeat these words in the 
summit meeting," he said.

billion yen grant to Ghana to help the African nation's efforts 
to promote economic structural reform and ease economic 
difficulties including debt problems, the Foreign Ministry said 
Wednesday [12 January]. 
  Japanese Ambassador to Ghana Toshihiro Kojima and Ghana's 
Foreign Minister Obed Asamoah signed an agreement on the grant 
in the capital city of Accra, the ministry said. 
  The grant-in-aid is part of a Japanese pledge to extend 
between 650 and 700 million dollars to African nations over a 
three-year period, it said. 
  Japan made the pledge at the G-7 summit in Munich in 1992.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- The chairman of the House of 
Councillors' Special Committee on Political Reform resigned 
Wednesday [12 January] after the panel passed a no-confidence 
motion against him the opposition had submitted in protest 
against his handling of political reform bills. 
  The ruling and opposition camps agreed later to pick panel 
member Yubun Ueno as successor to Shoji Motooka as committee 
chairman. Both Ueno and Motooka are members of the Social 
Democratic Party [of Japan], the largest among the seven parties 
in the ruling coalition. 
  The committee voted 17-16 to pass the motion submitted by 
the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], the main opposition party. 
  Members of the LDP, the Japanese Communist Party and the 
Niin 
Club, a small group of upper house members, voted for the motion. 
  The resolution is legally not binding and only reflects the 
committee's feelings, Diet officials said. 
  The LDP's motion was an apparent bid to slow the passage of 
government-proposed political reform bills through the upper 
house, coalition sources said. 
  The main opposition party accused Motooka of ignoring the 
LDP's objections to the holding of a vote two days before to set 
the date of a public hearing on January 17. 
  The setting of the hearing paves way for the ruling 
coalition 
to vote on the reform bills. 
  Coalition sources said the ruling parties may vote on the 
package of four reform bills in the committee on January 18 and 
at a plenary session the following day. 
  If the bills pass the second chamber without being modified, 
they will become law since the House of Representatives has 
already approved them. 
  The bills call for introducing single-seat constituencies 
combined with proportional representation for House of 
Representatives general elections and imposing stricter controls 
on political funding. Both ruling and opposition parties say 
the current multi-seat election constituencies are money 
guzzling and the root cause of political corruption. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has staked his political 
future on the enactment of the bills.

housing construction and real estate development," Hosokawa was 
quoted as saying. 
  Hosokawa also said he will try step by step to ease 
government controls in such fields as telecommunications, 
broadcasting and distribution systems. 
  The task force, which consists of cabinet members, will be 
headed by Hosokawa himself, the officials said. 
  He said, "there are some 200 regulations concerning housing 
construction, and if such controls are eased construction costs 
should decline to two-thirds of the current price level." 
  Such deregulation would have an instant effect, he said. 
"For instance, if controls on imported materials are lifted, we 
can expect an effect as early as April." 
  The task force will also help boost local government 
administration and reduce bureaucracy, Hosokawa said. 
  Meanwhile, Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet spokesman, told 
a news conference that the government will incorporate measures 
to ease housing and real estate controls in a pump-priming 
package to be announced later this month.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- A top business executive 
asked Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Wednesday [12 January] 
to see through long-delayed political reform as quickly as 
possible so as to fully combat the languishing Japanese economy, 
the top government spokesman said. 
  Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of 
Corporate 
Executives (Keizai Doyukai), made the request when he and other 
leaders of his business lobby met with the prime minister over 
breakfast, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said at a 
news conference. 
  Hosokawa told the business leaders that now is the crucial 
time in Diet debate on a government-sponsored political reform 
package aimed at rooting out corruption in Japanese public life. 
  Hosokawa has staked his premiership on enactment of the 
package before the current Diet session ends on January 29. 
  The premier reportedly said he wants to make a judgment on 
fresh pump-priming measures in line with talks of an economic 
panel of the government and ruling coalition parties.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Wednesday [12 January] the government wants to get 
political reform bills through a House of Councillors plenary 
session not later than January 19. 
  In related developments, an upper house political reform 
panel adopted a motion by the governing coalition to hold a 
public hearing in local cities on January 18, a precondition to 
voting on the bills in the upper house plenary session. On 
Monday, the committee endorsed a resolution to hold a hearing in 
Tokyo on January 17. 
  The committee rejected a motion by the opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) to hold public hearings in Tokyo on 
January 18 and 19 as well as in local cities on January 20 and 
21. 
  Speaking to leaders of Japan's four main business groups 
during a luncheon, Hosokawa said he called for the passage of 
the bills through the upper house. 
  The groups are the Federation of Economic Organizations 
(Keidanren), the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the 
Japan Federation of Employers' Associations (Nikkeiren) and the 
Japan Association of Corporate Executives. 
  If the bills pass the second chamber without being modified, 
they will become law since the bills cleared the more powerful 
House of Representatives on November 18. 
  Hosokawa also said he will consider whether it is possible 
for the government to amend a package of four 
government-proposed bills in the upcoming 150-day ordinary Diet 
session starting from January 31. 
  He has staked his political future on the enactment of the 
bills by the end of the current Diet session on January 29. 
  The bills call for replacing the current 511-seat lower 
chamber with a 500-seat mixture of 274 single-seat 
constituencies and 226 proportional representation seats. 
  The LDP has been demanding that the number of single-seat 
constituencies be increased from the proposed 274. It has also 
urged the coalition to ease curbs on a proposed ban on donations 
from business corporations to individual politicians. 
  Earlier in the day, Yubun Ueno, a panel member, replaced 
Shoji Motooka as committee chairman. Motooka resigned after the 
panel passed a no-confidence motion against him in protest 
against his handling of the political reform bills. 
  The committee voted 17-16 to pass the motion submitted by 
the 
LDP with the endorsement of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) 
and the Niin Club, a small parliamentary group. 
  Both Ueno and Motooka are members of the Social Democratic 
Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the largest among the seven 
parties in the ruling coalition. 
  The LDP accused Motooka of ignoring its objections to the 
timetable for public hearings set by the governing coalition. 
  The timetable for public hearing paves the way for the 
ruling 
coalition to vote on the reform bills. 
  Coalition sources said the ruling parties may vote on the 
package of four reform bills in the committee on January 19 and 
at a plenary session later in the day.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- The Social Democratic 
Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the largest bloc in the ruling 
coalition, adopted its draft action program for 1994 on 
Wednesday [12 January] that says the party will remain in the 
coalition and realign political forces. 
  In the final day of the party's two-day convention, 
delegates 
including party legislators and representatives from local 
chapters in 47 prefectures, approved the action program as drawn 
up by the leadership. About 400 delegates have registered with 
the convention. 
  At the closing of the convention, Chairman Tomiichi Murayama 
presented the political outline and said that the party will 
realign political forces and rally liberal and social democratic 
forces. 
  The convention results put the party in alignment toward 
pushing political reform bills into law, on which Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa has staked his premiership. 
  Discrepancies among party members, however, were made much 
more clear over the political reform process and the party's 
relations with the coalition, SDP sources said. 
  On the back stage, those members mounted a fierce tug of war 
over resolutions of their own on such issues. 
  A group chiefly made up of representatives from local 
chapters submitted a resolution which calls for firstly 
legislating a law designed to prevent corruption without 
sticking to enacting political reform bills as a package. 
  The resolution also urges the party to leave the alliance if 
the coalition government takes policies which contravene the 
party's basic stance. 
  They have expressed dissatisfaction toward leadership, 
saying 
the party made "too many concessions" on important issues such 
as political reform and the partial opening of the country's 
rice market. 
  The newly-formed interparty policy study group "Democrats," 
on the other hand, counterproposed a resolution which urges the 
party to stay in the coalition and leave the discretion for 
negotiation and political judgment on the government's crucial 
policies to the party leadership. 
  Murayama, however, dissuaded [as received] the two groups to 
retract the resolutions, saying that if the convention is forced 
to vote for either of the resolutions the party's disarray will 
be doomed, party officials said. 
  In exchange for their conformity to Murayama's request, the 
chairman accepted their demands that the party will do its 
utmost to get political reform bills into law without amending 
the basic points of the bills during the current extraordinary 
Diet session set to end on January 29. 
  The government's package of four political reform bills is 
in 
the House of Councillors for further deliberation after it 
passed in the more powerful House of Representatives last 
November. 
  The bills call for replacing the current multiseat 
constituencies of the lower house with a combination of 
single-seat districts and proportional representation, as well 
as tightening curbs on political fund-raising activities. 
  The ratio of single-seat constituencies in the dual system 
and electoral unit for proportional representation are the key 
points over which both the government and the largest opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) have been haggling to seek a 
compromise. 
  The LDP wants a bigger ratio for single-seat districts 
because the system is advantageous for a large party like the 
LDP, while the SDP is reluctant to increasing the figure out of 
fear that the party's existence could be at risk. 
  The government bills aim to introduce 274 for single-seat 
districts and 226 for proportional representation. 
  Murayama also said that the party will not agree to a hike 
in 
the consumption tax from the current 3 percent level to finance 
cuts in income tax expected as part of anticipated economic 
stimulus measures. 
  The SDP chairman also vowed to try to revamp the country's 
agriculture following the acceptance of a GATT proposal asking 
the country to partially lift the blanket ban on imports of rice. 
  The SDP, with many legislators from farming areas like the 
LDP, had opposed the GATT proposal but ultimately compromised to 
approve the government decision to partially open the rice 
market as the Uruguay Round of global trade talks reached the 
deadline on last December 15.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Tokyo Asahi Television Network in 
Japanese at 0109 GMT on 9 January, as part of its 105-minute 
talk show "Sunday Project" which begins at 0100 GMT, carries a 
35-minute live interview with Yohei Kono, president of the 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), by economic commentator Soichiro 
Tawara at the Asahi Television studio in Tokyo. 
  At 0111 GMT, Tawara begins the interview by discussing 
censure motions submitted by the LDP in the House of Councillors 
against the foreign minister and the farm minister over the 
decision to partially open the rice market. He says that some 
people believe the LDP's plan is to delay deliberations on 
political reform. Denying the allegation, Kono says: "We 
submitted censure motions in the upper house because the 
ministers' agreement on the decision apparently runs counter to 
upper house resolutions calling for maintaining self-sufficiency 
in rice." He stresses that the LDP has no intention of delaying 
deliberations on political reform. 
  Tawara says that the LDP acts like an unmanageable child 
when 
negotiating with the ruling coalition. Refuting Tawara, Kono 
says: "The ruling coalition acts high-handedly and does not 
listen to what the LDP has to say. Opposing such an attitude, 
we have called for dialogue." Kono then explains the efforts 
made by the LDP following the adoption of political reform bills 
in the lower house in mid- November to promote discussions on 
political reform and a supplementary budget for economic 
recovery, stressing: "People must clearly understand these 
efforts." Moreover, he criticizes the ruling coalition for 
rejecting LDP demands for promoting deliberations both on 
political reform and economic recovery. 
  Returning to the rice issue, Tawara asks Kono whether he 
opposes the partial opening of the rice market. Kono, without 
answering the question directly, notes that rice farmers in such 
countries as Australia and the United States are growing rice 
for export to Japan, while Japanese farmers produce rice for 
domestic consumption. He expresses apprehension over the impact 
on Japanese farmers of the decision to partially open the rice 
market. 
  After citing news reports saying that the LDP has changed 
its 
attitude and has become flexible in debate on political reform, 
Tawara asks for Kono's comments on the reports. Kono says: "I 
have asserted from the beginning that the political reform issue 
should be concluded in the current Diet session" and notes that 
because of a lack of concessions on the part of the ruling 
coalition in the lower house, the issue is now being discussed 
in the upper house. He adds: "The debate in the upper house is 
aimed at narrowing differences between government-proposed 
political reform bills and the reform plan put forward by the 
LDP." 
  Tawara and Kono then discuss three key issues in political 
reform on which the LDP and the ruling coalition have not yet 
reached an agreement: electoral district units for proportional 
representation; the reapportionment of seats for the lower 
house; and the handling of political donations by corporations 
and other organizations. Kono notes that the ruling coalition is 
split over the issue of whether to compromise with the LDP on 
these issues. When asked if he rejected compromise measures 
proposed by Prime Minister Morhiro Hosokawa during the 
Hosokawa-Kono summit talks last year, Kono says: "No. We both 
refused to accept each other's compromise plans. I presented my 
opinions and Mr. Hosokawa rejected them." 
  Tawara next asks Kono whether the LDP will accept the 
proposal, which has surfaced within the ruling coalition as a 
compromise measure, to divide the nation into electoral blocs 
for voting on the basis of proportional representation. Kono 
says: "Since we want votes for seats involving proportional 
representation to be cast on a prefectural basis, discussions 
will be necessary." 
  Concerning Tawara's question about whether there is one 
issue 
among the three key issues on which the LDP can compromise, Kono 
stresses the need for further discussion. Tawara then says that 
the LDP needs to make compromises in talks with the ruling 
coalition. Kono responds: "It is necessary to make concessions 
to enact the political reform bills. That is why I am asking 
Mr. Hosokawa to compromise." Asked whether he would accept an 
offer to hold summit talks with Hosokawa again to narrow 
differences, Kono gives a negative view, noting the importance 
of respecting political reform debate in the upper house. 
Finally, Tawara asks whether the LDP is determined not to 
boycott deliberations on political reform in the upper house. 
Kono answers: "Our party will never do such a thing." 
  The interview ends at 0146 GMT.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- The farm ministry will 
seek an additional 500 billion yen to expand the scale of 
Japan's rice farming under the third supplementary budget for 
fiscal 1993, ministry officials said Wednesday [12 January]. 
  Large-scale farming is needed to cut the cost of rice 
production in Japan, said the officials at the Agriculture, 
Forestry, and Fisheries Ministry [MAFF]. 
  Later this month the government is expected to compile the 
extra budget for the year ending next March 31 as part of its 
economic stimulus package. 
  The extra money is needed to deal with the government's 
decision in December to partially open Japan's rice market, the 
officials said. 
  The government made the decision when it accepted a proposal 
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at the 
GATT-sponsored Uruguay Round of global trade talks. 
  Under the proposal, Japan will be exempted from 
tariffication 
of rice imports for a grace period of six years, in return for 
which it will import 400,000 to 800,000 tons of rice a year as 
"minimum access" to imports. 
  The ministry is seeking to expand the scale of rice farming 
by increasing the minimum size of a paddy field to one hectare 
from the present 30 acres, the officials said. 
  Mechanization will also be promoted on rice farms through 
government-subsidized loans.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- Prices of popular brands 
of domestic rice sold from outlets outside government control 
have begun to rise again ahead of the full-scale debut of 
imported rice on the market in March, dealers reported Wednesday 
[12 January]. 
  They said the price of Japanese rice began to rise at the 
beginning of the year, with the popular "koshihikari" brand 
harvested in Niigata Prefecture hitting a high of about 34,000 
yen per 60 kilograms as of Wednesday. 
  Prices of other popular brands have risen 1,500-2,000 yen 
per 
60 kilograms over the year-end levels, they said. 
  Rice imported from the United States and Thailand is 
expected 
to hit the domestic market in March. 
  The government has decided to import more than one million 
tons of foreign rice to make up for a shortage in supplies 
caused by 1993's poor harvest, the worst since the war. 
  A private rice market research organization said retailers 
are scrambling for popular brands of domestic rice ahead of the 
introduction of foreign rice. 
  The Agriculture Ministry, worried that the strong demand for 
domestic rice may disrupt the supply-demand balance, has 
instructed rice retailers to blend domestic rice with imports.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- The government must 
specify when an income tax cut would be offset before 
implementing such a step to boost the economy, Finance Minister 
Hirohisa Fujii said Wednesday [12 January]. 
  For any bonds the government might float to pay for a tax 
cut, "a firm guarantee of repayment that everyone can 
understand" is necessary, Fujii told a regular press conference. 
  The timing must be concrete and dealt with in the same 
legislation as the income tax cut, he said. 
  Fujii seemed to leave open the possibility that the debt 
from 
an income tax cut could be covered by funding means other than a 
consumption tax hike, which socialists in the ruling coalition 
oppose. 
  "I have never used the term `consumption tax,'" he said, but 
he praised a report by the government's Tax Commission, which 
calls for reducing the income tax burden and increasing direct 
taxation, which includes the consumption tax. 
  He said government and ruling coalition party leaders have 
not discussed specifics of funding an income tax cut.

  [Text] Nagoya, Jan. 11 KYODO -- Toshiba Corp. said 
Tuesday [11 January] it will double its capability of producing 
16-megabit dynamic random access memories (DRAMS) at its main 
chip-manufacturing base in Mie Prefecture. 
  Toshiba officials said its plant in Yokkaichi will have a 
capability of manufacturing two million chips of that type of 
DRAM every month by the end of the year. 
  They said the plant will need an investment of 20 billion 
yen 
and require 450 more employees, who will be transferred from 
nearby factories or newly employed, increasing the staff to 
about 1,000. 
  The 16-megabit DRAMs, used in advanced personal computers, 
are in strong demand from computer-related equipment makers, 
particularly in the United States.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- Mitsubishi Electric Corp. 
has developed a method to create an extremly thin film of 
single-crystal fullerene (C60) that can be vapor-deposited on 
base materials for possible practical use in semiconductors, a 
company spokesman said Wednesday [12 January]. 
  He said that only much smaller crystals for scientific 
experiments have so far been made. 
  He said the 1 square-centimeter, single-crystal 15 
nanometer-thin (one nanometer equals one-billionth of a meter) 
film, made by using the so-called ionized cluster beam (icb) 
method, is highly resistant to heat and radioactivity and has 
the potential for integration. 
  Details of the discovery will be announced at an academic 
meeting on fullerene to be held Thursday in Tokyo. 
  Mitsubishi Electric found in early 1992 that the next 
generation of carbon materials could be used for semiconductors. 
  The spokesman said the company will now try to develop a 
transistor device using the fullerene thin film. 
  Analysts say the material may also be applied to optical 
materials and catalysts, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- Nippon Telegraph and 
Telephone Corp. (NTT) will begin within a year a multimedia 
experiment with ordinary families using an optical fiber network 
system, the telecommunications giant said Wednesday [12 January]. 
  Masashi Kojima, president of NTT, said at a press conference 
that Japan should boost such optical fiber network-based 
multimedia business as the United States has already launched an 
information superhighway project. 
  Kojima said, "we can't be a loser in the global competition 
in the telecommunications field." 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration has begun 
setting up optical fiber network systems linking universities

  NTT will start an experiment with an interactive information 
network using a cable television system. With the system, 
audiovisual information can be picked up through 250 channels. 
  The experiment will be carried out with ordinary families 
which will be equipped with necessary devices as well as optical 
fiber terminals. 
  NTT has announced a project envisaging that every family

  [Text] Poipet, Cambodia, Jan 12 (AFP) -- Khmer Rouge 
rebels attacked and disabled a bridge early Wednesday, just one 
day before the Thai and Cambodian premiers were due to 
inaugurate it, a Cambodian military security officer said. 
  One Cambodian government soldier was killed and three were 
injured in a 30-minute firefight, the officer said. 
  He quoted officers stationed in [name indistinct] Borei, 30 
kilometers (20 miles) east of the Thai border, as saying that 
one Khmer Rouge guerrilla had also died. 
  The bridge, one of two built by Thai engineers on Cambodia's 
Highway 5, is now impassable, the Cambodian officer said. 
  Thai military officials responsible for the border region 
could not confirm the report. 
  Questioned by telephone from Bangkok, they said they were 
too 
far from the reported attack site to investigate. 
  Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, on a three-day visit to 
Cambodia to solidify economic and political relations, is 
scheduled open the bridge Thursday with Cambodian co-premier Hun 
Sen. 
  Both Thai and Cambodian officials maintained the incident 
would not affect Thursday's ceremony, though contingents of 
military police from the two countries had been reinforced. 
  Tanks and armored personnel carriers were moved into Poipet, 
opposite an area controlled by the Khmer Rouge, and Thailand 
temporarily closed its Klong Leuk-Poipet checkpoint, an officer 
said. 
  The Thailand-Cambodian Border Coordination Office has asked 
for a temporary ceasefire. 
  Meanwhile, heavy fighting between Khmer Rouge and government 
forces broke out 15 miles south in Phum Takong Krao district, 
Thai and Cambodian officers said. 
  Heavy artillery, rockets and self-propelled guns were 
reportedly used in the two-hour skirmish which began at 7a.m. 
(0000 GMT), they said. Casualty and injury reports were not 
immediately available.

  [Text] Phnom Penh 12 Jan (AKP) -- We reproduce here below 
the full text of a clarification made on Monday by Prince 
Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, first prime minister of the Royal 
Government of Cambodia [RGC]: 
  Following the 9 January AFP dispatch entitled "Ranariddh 
reneged on deal over peace talks" [title given in English] which 
concerns my letter dated 28 December to His Excellency [H.E.] 
Khieu Samphan, I, Norodom Ranariddh, wish to make the following 
clarification: 
  1. At the 17 December meeting with H.E. Khieu Samphan, I 
said that due to concrete reasons, it was neither useful nor 
productive to have talks within the framework of a technical 
group consisting only of the representatives of the Party of 
Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] and the FUNCINPEC [National United 
Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative 
Cambodia] Party. 
  2. The idea of having a quadripartite discussion is not 
realistic after the implementation of the peace process in line 
with the Paris accords and after the formation of the royal 
government emerging from the same process. 
  3. With a view to advancing the process of national 
reconciliation, I agree to have a technical working group with 
no reference to the PDK or the RGC. On that occasion, I told 
H.E. Khieu Samphan that if the PDK looked through all the points 
of the 21 November article proposed by His Majesty the king, it 
should have noted that His Majesty clearly mentions in that same 
article: "The PDK and the RGC." 
  4. At the 17 December meeting, I made it clear that even if 
a technical group is set up without any name, this should also 
be accepted by H.E. Hun Sen, second prime minister of the RGC. 
  5. In Beijing, His Majesty, speaking with enormous wisdom 
and reason and in his capacity as a father, asked me to 
establish the technical working group made up of the 
representatives of the PDK and of "Samdech Krompreah, first 
prime minister of the RGC." With reference to this suggession, 
I would like to propose again to the PDK this formula with H.E. 
Sok An and H.E. Veng Sereivut as RGC representatives. Besides, 
this royal formula has already been endorsed by H.E. Chea Sim 
and H.E. Hun Sen. 
  6. In my reply to H.E. Khieu Samphan's letter that was 
quoted by AFP, I clearly stated that: 
  A. The RGC accepts the five-point proposal of His Majesty 
the king. 
  B. I asked H.E. Khieu Samphan whether it is possible to 
accept the proposed formula for the technical working group. 
This is to accelerate the process of national reconciliation 
and peace. 
  7. Nonetheless, it is obvious that the PDK is not sincere in 
the so-called desire for peace and national reconciliation. 
  The simple proof is that while declaring acceptance of all 
the elements of His Majesty the king of Cambodia's article, the 
Khmer Rouge do not want to recognize the RGC, while insisting at 
the same time that they become members or advisors to that same 
government.

<F P=106> [By Kevin Barrington] </F>
  [Excerpts] Phnom Penh, Jan 11 (AFP) -- The likelihood of a 
negotiated settlement to the Cambodian conflict grew slim 
Tuesday as a war of words erupted over proposed peace talks, 
with co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh accusing the Khmer 
Rouge of deceit. [passage omitted] 
  "It is clear that the party of Democratic Kampuchea (DK or 
Khmer Rouge) is not sincere in its supposed desires for peace 
and national reconciliation," a statement from the prince said. 
  A contradiction in the Khmer Rouge's support for a proposal 
from King Norodom Sihanouk to end the conflict between the 
guerrillas and the government revealed their insincerity, the 
prince said. 
  "The simple proof is that, while declaring they accept all 
the elements of His Majesty the King of Cambodia's proposal, the 
Khmer Rouge do not want to recognise the Royal Government of 
Cambodia and at the same time they insist that they become 
members or advisors to that same government," the prince said. 
  In a clandestine meeting on December 17, the prince and the 
guerrilla leader agreed to set up a working group to discuss 
implementing the king's proposal where in exchange for ceasing 
all guerrilla activities, opening up their zones and merging 
their fighters with the national army, "acceptable" members of 
the Khmer Rouge would be given senior government posts. 
  In his statement, the prince dismissed Khieu Samphan's 
accusation that he had reneged on an agreement over the 
composition of the working group. 
  Khieu Samphan said the two leaders had settled on a formula 
where the group should either consist of representatives from 
just the Khmer Rouge and the royalists or if the Cambodian 
People's Party (CPP) were to be included, then the third party 
in the coalition government, the small Buddhist Liberal 
Democratic Party, had also to be represented. 
  But the prince -- who recently appointed just two 
representatives, cabinet ministers Veng Sereivut from FUNCINPEC 
[National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, 
and Cooperative Cambodia] and Sok An from the CPP -- said he 
told the guerrilla leader that the king's proposal "clearly 
referred" to talks between the "DK and Royal Government," not 
between the guerrillas and individual parties in the coalition 
government. [passage omitted] 
  The government has up to 2,000 troops poised ready for a 
final attack on the radical faction's key base at Anlong Veng 
near the Thai border in northern Siem Reap province, the 
minister said. 
  Meanwhile, a former prime minister of the 
Vietnamese-installed Phnom Penh regime, Pen Sovann, criticised 
the notion of bringing Khmer Rouge officials into the government. 
  "Their hands are soaked in the people's blood so we should 
ask the people whether we want to welcome them," Pen Sovann, who 
was ousted from his premier post in a 1981 internal party feud, 
said.

<F P=106> ["Full text of communique by National Army of Democratic </F>
Kampuchea spokesman on the failure of the 16th dry-season 
military operation of the Vietnamese communists, their puppets, 
and the U.S. entente against Democratic Kampuchea's [DK] 
liberated zone"; dated 10 January -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] I. It should be recalled that after the UNTAC [UN 
Transitional Authority in Cambodia] organized elections, the 
Vietnamese communists, their puppets, and the entente have 
staged a closed-door coup d'etat setting up this current 
two-headed government. In the meantime, in August 1993, the 
Vietnamese communists and the U.S. entente have mustered up 
their forces and launched attack against the Phnum Prah hill and 
Phnum Chhat in northern Sisophon, against Stoung in Kompong 
Thom, destroying everything, burning down houses, killing people 
indiscriminately, and plundering all sorts of property. The 
population fled their houses, farms, and rice fields while women 
were raped savagely. 
  What is the true nature of this act? 
  Firstly, it is actually the continuation of the Vietnamese 
aggression war against Cambodia. 
  Secondly, it is an act of flaming the war by the U.S. 
entente 
through the two-headed government set up by them. They have 
mustered up their destructive forces in order to fight against 
Democratic Kampuchea. 
  Therefore, who started the war at the end of 1978 and who 
continued to fan the flames of war by launching attacks against 
Phnum Chhat and Stoung last August? And who mapped out the 
so-called largest military operation ever against Anlung Veng in 
last September? 
  Presently, overexcited by their criminal feats in Phnum 
Chhat 
and Stoung, the Vietnamese communists, their puppets, and the 
entente hurriedly mounted a largest operation aimed at capturing 
Anlung Veng. In this regard, the puppet Hun Sen has shouted: 
"Fight, fight, fight. Fight against and totally exterminate the 
Khmer Rouge!." While in New York, he went so far as to declare 
that he would mobilize up to hundred thousand men and spend 
thousand lives to take over the Anlung Veng for Vietnam. Who is 
then responsible for the continuation of the current Vietnamese 
war of aggression? However, their large-scale military 
operation against Phnum Chhat in September 1993 met with 
crushing defeat. 
  II. Since November and December 1993, the two-headed 
government, Hun Sen, and others, have talked only about fight, 
fight, fight. They have called for launching military campaigns 
and making war against the Khmer Rouge. All these are 
Vietnamese communist slogans who have used them for a long time 
against the nation and people of Cambodia. They have not said a 
word about national reconciliation. They have overlooked and 
failed to notice the fact that Democratic Kampuchea has 
succeeded in defending and safeguarding the Cambodian nation and 
people because it forms part and parcel of the whole nation and 
people. In other words, because the nation and people have 
always been with Democratic Kampuchea in its struggle against 
the Vietnamese aggressors. 
  Specifically, since the end of October 1993, the Vietnamese 
communists, their puppets, and the U.S. entente have mapped out 
and prepared their military campaigns of the 16th dry season 
against Anlung Veng, Stoung, Malai, and Pailin. This is a large 
mobilization of forces of the Vietnamese communists and of the 
U.S.-financed forces. The U.S. and France are the financial 
backers. They, together with Australia, have also been 
responsible for the propaganda and psychological warfare 
campaign. They have done all this with the aim of destroying 
the Khmer Rouge, making it impossible to be part of a national 
army and in the government. Their goal is to force the Khmer 
Rouge, through military means, to accept their three-point 
conditions, namely laying down their arms, handing over the 
Democratic Kampuchea-held areas, and dissolving the National 
Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK]. 
  They have propagandized repeatedly about those conditions. 
They have opposed the king's five-point guideline for national 
reconciliation. The whole nation and people of Cambodia have 
welcomed and supported the king's five points. Still, they are 
adamantly oppose to them. In so doing, they aim at putting 
aside the king's five-point guideline, preventing the roundtable 
meeting or talks on national reconciliation and unity. 
  III. What are the concrete results of these military 
campaigns? 
  They have launched these large-scale operations since 
November 1993 but they met with crushing defeats in December 
last and this early January. What are the causes of their 
failure? 
  Firstly, they lack fighting forces. The people are strongly 
against them. They are against the war. Some who have been 
enlisted by force have deserted for lack of money, salaries, 
rice, salt, et cetera. The people need to care about their own 
lives. They refuse to be killed for the two-headed government, 
the Vietnamese communists, and the entente. They don't want to 
die and they don't want to see the nation and people disappear. 
  Secondly, they lack ammunition. So far, no one has agreed to 
sell them ammunition. Everybody wants peace and national 
reconciliation in Cambodia. 
  Thirdly, they have no economy, no food. In the course of the 
13th, 14th, and 15th years of the Vietnamese war of aggression, 
everything has been plundered. The country has been devastated. 
The people's land, water, and cattle have been destroyed. 
Moreover, the two-headed government has conscripted them into 
the army. As a result, the economy is in a shambles. In such a 
situation, they have been forced to put off their military 
campaigns again and again. They have postponed their initial 17 
December 1993 plan to early January 1994. 
  Their activities and failure can be summed up as follows: 
  1. Malai battlefield. They launched a three-pronged 
military attack on the 1 January 1994: the first prong along the 
Mongkolborei river; the second from Route 5 to Dong Aranh; and 
the third from Poipet into Thailand at Nang E, aimed at 
attacking from the rear. They deployed infantry along Route 5 
backed by several pieces of heavy artillery, multiple rocket 
launchers, and armored vehicles. 
  The forces in this campaign were the 12th Division at Nimit 
in charge of the Banteay Meanchey region; the 6th Division 
stationed along the Stoeng Mongkolborei river; and the 7th and 
8th divisions, respectively stationed along Route 69 and at 
Phnum Srok. All together, four divisions from the Vietnamese 
communist puppets, ANKI [National Army of Independent Cambodia], 
and Dien Del [Khmer People's National Liberation Front] forces. 
  The NADK and the people in the Malai region were aware of 
this scheme beforehand. Together, they foiled this so-called 
large-scale military campaign by displaying their high spirit of 
strong determination and responsibility toward the nation and 
people, preventing the enemy from carrying out their strategy 
and tactics to destroy the national forces and the people and to 
swallow up Cambodia. In the course of fighting which lasted for 
three days from 1-3 January 1994, the NADK and people 
successfully held the military campaign in check using mines, 
booby traps, and attacking from the front, the rear, and the 
flanks. This was combined with some heavy artillery along with 
political and economic activities. 
  During this campaign, Pol Saroeun, the puppet military 
commander in Phnom Penh; Hul Savoan from Battambang and Prum 
Moranak, the zone military commander, were shamefully beaten 
back. These Vietnamese puppets were defeated but their masters 
continued stubbornly to desperately carry out their strategy. 
  The Cambodian nation and people and the NADK living in the 
Malai region remain vigilant and prepare to struggle against the 
enemy. The latter must clearly realize that Democratic Kampuchea 
enjoys the support of the whole nation and people. Thus an 
attack against Democratic Kampuchea would amount to an attack 
against the whole nation and people. In the past, they have 
mounted countless attacks--large or medium or small--against 
Democratic Kampuchea. But they all failed. If they pursue 
their venture, the result would surely be the same, as in the 
case of the Vietnamese aggressors in the last 13 years. 
  2. Anlung Veng battlefield: They have prepared their 
military campaign against Anlung Veng and the Dangrek zone since 
November 1993. But they have failed to carry it out for lack of 
fighting forces, ammunition, and food. 
  At the end of December, they tried again by dividing their 
forces in three prongs: the first from Route 68, particularly 
from Samraong eastward; the second from Varin and Sre Noy in 
Siem Reap Province; and the third from Kulen in Preah Vihear 
Province. Their combined forces deployed in that campaign 
include those of the Vietnamese communist puppets, ANKI, and 
Dien Del under the command of many so-called generals based on 
Route 68. Among them were Pol Saroeun, (Chuon Sovantha), (Uy 
Sopheap), Long Sopheap, Keo Pisit, (Prak Sovanna), and Nhoek 
Bunchhai. All of them were in desperate straits. Thus, their 
forces were decimated by mines everyday, armored vehicles were 
destroyed, and corpses were left on the ground. 
  It is to be recalled that during their large-scale 
operations last September, their forces suffered a heavy loss by 
mines, malaria, and starvation. Besides, in order to attack 
Anlung Veng, they mobilized their forces in Ampil, Ku, Romchong, 
Thmar Puok, Kouk Mon, Kouk Khpos, Boeng Trakuon, and Banteay 
Chhma before sending them to Route 68 and Anlung Veng. But the 
NADK and the population have attacked their bases both on the 
east and west of Route 68 making them flee in disarray. 
  As a result, the Route 68 battlefield and the enemy forces 
were divided in two parts, causing serious harm to the 
Vietnamese puppet forces' Divisions 286, 179, and 3 at O Smach, 
the 9th Division on Route 68, the 8th at Phnum Srok, and the 7th 
on Route 69. 
  The present fighting causes panic among the two-headed 
government's forces. They desert daily in large numbers. Field 
commanders dare not show up in the field. Only the rank and 
file do so. But the latter refuse to die for their commanders, 
for the two-headed government, the Vietnamese communists, and 
the entente whose only objective is to exterminate the Cambodian 
nation and people. 
  In summary, one can say that the military campaign against 
Anlung Veng was transformed into the battlefields east and west 
of Route 68, that of Varin-Siem Reap and Kulen-Preah Vihear, 
which form a large and active fighting area directly affecting 
the Vietnamese puppet forces, the U.S.-supported forces, and the 
entente who are responsible for the continuation of the war in 
Cambodia. 
  It should be noted that in this battlefield, the people who 
have been angry since last September 1993 were actively 
participating in making the two-headed government's military 
campaign a failure. The enemy forces can be compared to people 
entering a bush fire which engulfs them from all sides. 
  3. Stoung battlefield in Kompong Thom Province. They have 
launched operations on the Stoung battlefield and Route 12 for 
quite some time. Their puppet commanders have been mobilized 
for that purpose. They began to seriously prepare their 
campaign in November and December 1993. However, they were 
successively checked by the NADK and the local population. 
  All people in Kompong Thom, soldiers, policemen, even 
foreigners, were fully aware of who attacked whom. The 
population and the NADK in Stoung, exercising their right to 
self-defense, fought back and put them to rout. The main causes 
for their defeat are: 
  A. The nation and people of Cambodia, as well as the 
peace-loving countries the world over, are opposed to the 
continuation of the Vietnamese war of aggression. 
  B. The people want national reconciliation and peace while 
they flame the war. 
  C. The enemy forces have committed mass killing destroying 
everything. As a result, people have fled their homes and 
villages and taken refuge in forests. These people have then 
become a people's force of hundreds of thousands of men and 
women fighting back both militarily and economically. They cut 
off the enemy's supply routes, laid mines and booby traps, and 
encouraged and called on their children to desert. 
  Therefore, the NADK has closely identified with hundreds of 
thousands of people and together fought against enemy forces 
everywhere like sparrows landing in a ricefield. 
  Democratic Kampuchea should not be looked (?alone) as a 
litter. It is closely linked and united with the people and all 
the national forces, making it an enormous force fighting for 
the defense and security of the Cambodian nation and people to 
this day. 
  One may ask whether the aggressors fighting against the 
whole 
Cambodian nation and people have lost or won their war. They 
cannot escape defeat before the nation and people of Cambodia, 
who are so oppressed by anger that they would fight [word 
indistinct] to the end. 
  IV. How to resolve the Cambodia conflict 
  The only way is to achieve national reconciliation based on 
the five-point guideline of Samdech Euv, His Majesty the King. 
This five-point guideline represents the profound aspiration of 
the nation and people of Cambodia and that of peace-loving 
countries in the world. 
  Whoever challenges these five points is against the 
Cambodian 
nation and people and against peace-loving countries in the 
world, in particular those in the region. Therefore, the trend 
of the Cambodian nation and people is leading toward national 
reconciliation in order to restore peace and provide opportunity 
for the rebuilding of the country and raising the people's 
standard of living. This would contribute to stability in the 
region as well. 
  Hence, the beginning of 1994 is the last occasion for the 
thorough assessment of the situation. The fighting has lasted 
for already 13, 14, and 15 years. It must end. What has 
happened to the Vietnamese aggressors who have been well-known 
for their fighting skills? All the people have already learned 
this lesson. They have to see clearly who is with Democratic 
Kampuchea, that is, the whole nation and people of Cambodia. 
  The five-point guideline of Samdech Euv is of paramount 
importance. Democratic Kampuchea has been now acclaimed as the 
one who holds the banner of national reconciliation and fights 
for that purpose. This is to say that the people and Democratic 
Kampuchea are one. Whoever opposes national reconciliation and 
continues the war would be doomed to fade away. 
  [Dated] 10 January 1994 
  [Signed] The spokesman of the NADK.

  [Excerpt] Certain Thai banks in Cambodia, which reportedly 
will have their contracts revoked, pioneered banking in that 
country and have no connections with the Thai banking sector. 
The Cambodian Finance Ministry is seeking to reorganize the 
commercial banking system. 
  Cambodian Finance Minister Sam Rangsi informed PHUCHATKAN 
that his ministry is in the process of issuing an order that 
will immediately close local and foreign commercial banks that 
did not bring any capital into the country for their operations. 
  An inspection of licenses the commercial banks received from 
the Cambodian national bank during the Hun Sen government's 
tenure reveals that 50 percent of the existing 21 banks did not 
operate like real banks. Some sell lottery tickets, while 
others were established for the purpose of laundering money. 
  The Cambodian national bank early this week sent a circular 
to all commercial banks to transfer $5 million in registered 
capital to the national bank within 30 days. Failure to comply 
will result in the termination of their licenses. 
  Sam said: "We must change commercial bank regulations. Banks 
that have not operated like real banks or have done notorious 
business will have to leave. We will only allow reputable banks 
with capital to support their functions to operate in Cambodia." 
  The Cambodian finance minister said the Cambodian national 
bank will withdraw its shares in all commercial banks so that it 
can fully control the operations of commercial banks. 
  The new regulations have greatly displeased commercial banks 
because the transfer of capital to the national bank will 
deprive them of operational funds. 
  According to a source in Phnom Penh, a loosely-formed 
association of commercial banks is negotiating with the 
Cambodian national bank and the finance minister to use the 
capital that is to be transferred for their banking operations. 
The outcome of the negotiations is not known at this time.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 10 (KCNA) -- World public and 
press strongly demand that the nuclear problem on the Korean 
peninsula be solved through DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  Luciano Pettinari, international secretary of the Italian 
Party for Communist Refoundation, said the United States is 
trying to justify its military threat to North Korea on the 
pretext of "preventing" the latter's "nuclear program," but 
could convince nobody of it. It is foolish of the United States 
to try to force "sanctions" on North Korea through the UN 
Security Council, he said, adding: 
  The point in question is that nuclear warheads aimed at the 
North and more than 40,000 U.S. troops present in South Korea 
pose a greater threat than a feasibility of North Korea's 
"nuclear program". 
  S.J. Mabulla, chairman of the Scientific and Technical 
Association of Tanzania, said that if the United States wants to 
save its face as a great power, it had better honestly respond 
to talks with the DPRK. 
  Noting that if the United States truly want a solution to 
the 
nuclear problem, it must sincerely accede to talks, the Radio 
Reloj Nacional of Cuba said that a peaceful solution of the 
nuclear problem depends entirely on the attitude of the United 
States. 
  The Swiss paper UNSERE WELT said that the United States 
should renounce its policy hostile to the DPRK and the nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula be settled through DPRK-U.S. talks.

<F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 12 January commentator's article: "We Warn </F>
Japanese Rightwing Reactionaries"] 
  [Text] The Japanese right-wing reactionaries' 
anti-Republic maneuvers are becoming more grave with each 
passing day. 
  By recently bringing to the front experts in Korean issues 
and the press, they are repeatedly waging smear and defamation 
against our socialist system, and are speaking ill of us by 
talking about our so-called economic difficulties and so forth. 
  Moreover, they are rashly acting to slander even our system. 
They also openly revealed the ambition for military reinvasion 
of our country. 
  The new state advocates [sin kukka chuuija], like Ozawa, 
representative of the Japan Renewal Party; and Nakanishi, former 
director general of the Japan Defense Agency, branded us as No.1 
imaginary enemy by maximizing our nuclear issue and missile 
threat. They said that in the event a state of emergency is 
created on the Korean peninsula, they will cope with it jointly 
with Japan, the United States, and South Korea as one. They even 
made absurd and bellicose remarks that a preemptive attack 
should be the basis of Japan's national strategy. Some media 
also joined this. 
  As soon as it greeted the new year, the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 
reported that because our country is a most dangerous and 
entirely unpredictable nation, Japan, as its neighbor, should 
not forget its existence, and that Japan would participate in 
war on the Korean peninsula. 
  As has been proven, the Japanese right-wing reactionaries 
and 
some media have lost their discretion and are maliciously 
slandering us. 
  Regarding such an act by the Japanese reactionaries as a 
challenge to us, we consider it a grave act. 
  The anti-Republic smear campaign of the Japanese 
reactionaries is a product of the consciousness of crisis of 
those who are struck with terror at the might and invincibility 
of the anthropocentric socialist system of our country. 
  In recent years, socialism was frustrated in some countries 
and capitalism was restored. Cheering this, the imperialists 
are scheming to eliminate socialism from the earth forever and 
their spearhead has been directed at our Republic. 
  Our people, however, are vigorously accelerating socialist 
construction by upholding the banner of chuche socialism and by 
overcoming repeated difficulties even amid political and 
military pressure, threat, and economic blockade of the enemies. 
  The superiority of ever-victorious socialism in our country 
and the might of chuche Korea have been fully demonstrated. This 
worked as encouraging might to the world's people who are 
fighting for the socialist cause--the cause of independence. 
  A number of reactionaries, who ran amok to smash our 
socialism, crumbled to the ground by themselves. 
  Nevertheless, the Japanese reactionaries are trying 
maliciously to detract from the attraction of our socialism and 
isolate and stifle us. This is one of the reasons they are 
stubbornly resorting to the hostile, false propaganda aimed at 
besmirching the dignity and authority of our Republic, while 
distorting facts and reversing black and white. 
  This proves that the Japanese reactionaries are the most 
atrocious enemy of socialism. It is no doubt that if they 
continuously resort to anti-Republic and antisocialist 
maneuvers, they will be subject to stern denunciation as the 
enemy of all of the world's progressive people who are advancing 
toward socialism. 
  If those who are regarded as quick-witted [yaksa pparuda] 
people act foolishly ignoring the solemn reality existing in 
front of them, they will only be reflected as pitiful existence 
to the people. 
  It is a nasty habit of the Japanese reactionaries to try to 
attain their sinister aims by vilifying others. Today prospects 
opened for the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  As has been reported, holding the third round of talks, our 
country and the United States agreed to settle in a package 
[ilgwal tagyol] the issues for the essential solution of the 
nuclear problem. 
  Many countries in the world and progressive people welcome 
such developments in the situation. 
  Even political quarters, social circles, and academic 
sectors 
in Japan raised voices demanding the solution of the nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula and improvement of DPRK-U.S. 
relations. 
  Nevertheless, only the Japanese right-wing reactionaries and 
their followers are opposed to this. The Japanese right-wing 
reactionaries are all militarists and revanchists obsessed with 
an irresistible zeal for reinvasion. They are stepping up their 
moves to turn Japan into a military power and arm it with 
nuclear weapons and have justified this by raising the fiction 
about our nuclear threat and missile threat. 
  If the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula is solved and 
DPRK-U.S. relations are improved, the Japanese reactionaries 
will be unable to use this fiction any more as an excuse. 
  This is the reason why the Japanese reactionaries are 
trying hard to hamper the solution of the nuclear problem on the 
Korean peninsula and the improvement of relations between the 
DPRK and the United States. 
  Japan's attempt to be a military power and to arm itself 
with 
nuclear weapons does not originate from someone's threat but 
entirely originates from the Japanese militarists' demand for 
realizing the ambition for overseas aggression. The Japanese 
reactionaries regard the Korean peninsula as their first target. 
This is actually proven by fact -- the Japanese right-wing 
reactionaries have not hesitated to say that if an emergency 
situation takes place on the Korean peninsula, a preemptive 
attack should be basic in the state's strategy and Japan will 
participate in the war on the Korean peninsula. 
  In the past, the Japanese imperialists occupied Korea for 
approximately 40 years and imposed innumerable miseries and 
sufferings on the Korean people. Our people have not forgotten 
the Japanese imperialists' atrocities of sanguinary slaughters 
and their cruel activities of exploitation and plunder. Our 
people cannot refrain from expressing wrath at the Japanese 
imperialists. 
  If the Japanese reactionaries have a bit of conscience, they 
should truly apologize to our people for the great miseries and 
sufferings and should compensate for them. Instead of 
liquidating the past full of crimes, however, the Japanese 
reactionaries are running wild through thick and thin in a bid 
to achieve the ambition for the great East Asia coprosperity 
sphere by reviving the past. 
  The Japanese reactionaries' way of thinking and position are 
not different from those of the Japanese imperialists at all. 
We cannot but point out that the Japanese right-wing 
reactionaries' false propaganda against the DPRK is aimed at 
making Japan's politics reactionary and fascist and at 
obstructing the improvement of DPRK- Japanese relations. On the 
pretext of the threat from North Korea, they are trying to 
pressure those who call for improvement of DPRK- Japanese 
relations. 
  Today's reality shows that if the Japanese Government 
authorities continue to leave alone the right-wing reactionaries 
to run wild recklessly, Japan would be made all the more 
reactionary and thereby the Japanese people themselves would 
suffer therefrom, and then, the neighboring countries would not 
be safe either. 
  The more the Japanese reactionaries adhere to the stratagem 
against the DPRK, the more this proves the validity of our 
socialist cause. No false propaganda and reckless military 
strength obliterate [malsal] the socialism of our own style 
centered on the popular masses, which brilliantly gives off its 
ray. 
  The Japanese reactionaries are conducting the activity to 
eliminate someone, without considering the single-hearted unity 
among the leader [suryong], the party, and the masses and the 
might of our socialist self-reliant national economy and the 
self- defense in the national defense. This reminds us of the 
saying, Fools rush in where angels fear to thread. The Japanese 
right-wing reactionaries should give up the foolish thought -- 
like breaking a rock with head. 
  Only fools can conduct excessive proud activity. Our people 
and People's Army are closely watching with a high degree of 
vigilance the Japanese reactionaries' anti-DPRK and 
antisocialist maneuvers. Our people will never pardon those who 
are trying to impair the national dignity. 
  We solemnly warn the Japanese reactionaries: If the Japanese 
reactionaries constantly persist in the reckless anti-DPRK and 
antisocialist maneuvers, they will not get good results. They 
must stop acting rashly.

  [Text] Tokyo, January 10 (KNS-KCNA) -- A central meeting of 
activists of the General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan (Chongnyon) was held here Monday to thoroughly implement 
the tasks facing Chongnyon in 1994 in hearty response to the New 
Year teachings of the great leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song. 
  A message of greetings sent by the great leader 
Generalissimo 
Kim Il-song to Han Tok-su, chairman of the Central Standing 
Committee of Chongnyon, on the new year was read out at the 
meeting. 
  Yi Chin-kyu, first vice-chairman of the Chongnyon Central 
Standing Committee, addressing the meeting, said one of the most 
valuable achievements made by Chongnyon in its work in 1993 was 
that officials of Chongnyon and compatriots in Japan came to 
cherish deep in mind as never before the pride and honor of 
having and following dear Comrade Kim Chong-il as their 
illustrious leader. 
  Noting that 1994 is indeed a meaningful year preceding the 
50th anniversary of August 15 national liberation, the 40th 
founding anniversary of Chongnyon and the 17th meeting of 
Chongnyon, he elaborated on the main tasks of the year. 
  He stressed that Chongnyon founded and built by the great 
leader should develop into an overseas Koreans organisation of 
chuche type unfailingly loyal to the dear leader, a more 
powerful and viable organisation which struck its roots deep 
among the Koreans in Japan, generation after generation. 
  He underscored the need to arouse all the compatriots in 
Japan in the work to defend their national rights and upgrade 
democratic national education and vigorously conduct a drive to 
implement the "10-point programme of the great unity of the 
whole nation for the Reunification of the country" as an 
all-compatriots one and decisively step up external activities 
to increase the ranks of supporters and sympathizers among the 
Japanese people. 
  Officials of Chongnyon expressed their determination on the 
new year at the meeting. 
  The meeting adopted a letter to Generalissimo Kim Il-song.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 12 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
carries an article titled "Scores Must be Settled With Fascist 
Regime." 
  Noting that though nearly a year has passed since the Kim 
Yong- sam regime made its appearance, styling itself a "civilian 
government," nothing has changed in South Korea, the author of 
the article says: 
  As for the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime, it is the 
"second-term 
fascist government of the Sixth Republic", an offspring of the 
"Sixth Republic" of No Tae-u who made himself infamous with 
treacheries, fascism and murder. 
  In advertising "civilian administration," Kim Yong-sam the 
traitor has sought to veil the ugly color of his regime, not to 
shape any civilian politics. 
  What the Kim Yong-sam group has done under the "civilian" 
veil has been to put the people under heavier yoke of colonial 
slavery and bind them tighter to fascist chains, to drive the 
economy and the people's living to the worst phase with 
deceptive "reforms" and bring the situation of the country to 
the brink of war. 
  With the traitorous and fascist nature of the "civilian" 
regime and the fictitious nature of the "reforms" advertised by 
it fully revealed, the South Korean people have nothing to 
expect from it. What they have to do now is to finally settle 
scores with the false "civilian" regime. 
  The crafty "civilian" dictatorship is more heinous than the 
brutal military dictatorship and the former's consequences are 
more serious. 
  Kim Yong-sam is a rare fascist, warmaniac and traitor who 
would unhesitatingly turn the whole of South Korea into a sea of 
blood and plunge the nation into a nuclear holocaust for his 
personal comfort and distinction and maintenance of his power. 
  The Kim Yong-sam fascist clique is destined to meet a 
disgraceful doom in face of the strong resistance of the 
pro-reunification democratic forces.

  [Text] Now, after one year has passed since it emerged 
under the veil of a civilian administration, the current South 
Korean regime has fully revealed its face as a group of civilian 
fascists after completely taking off their masks. 
  The paper of pannational workers in South Korea questioned 
if 
the Kim Yong-sam government is truly a civilian government, and 
wrote that if the Kim Yong-sam government is truly a civilian 
government, it should prove that it differs from the Chon 
Tu-hwan and No Tae-u military governments. However, it is not 
different from a military regime. The traitorous nature of the 
civilian regime has been intensively exposed. 
  It is not an accident that the South Korean people brand and 
condemn the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime as a fascist regime far 
surpassing the Fifth and Sixth Republics. If the South Korean 
ruling bunch wants to carry out genuine civilian politics, it 
should first abolish the National Security Law, which infringes 
upon and obliterates the people's political rights and poses an 
obstacle to national reunification. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, however, is maintaining 
intact the National Security Law -- a remnant of a 
confrontational era and military dictatorship that instigated 
anticommunism and confrontation -- and committed 
antireunification and antinational acts. By wielding this law, 
it is cruelly oppressing the people's struggle for independence, 
democracy, and reunification. 
  One example is that in May 1993 the fascist ring, by 
mobilizing more than 100,000 police forces, atrociously 
suppressed the struggle of youth, students, and citizens 
demanding revelation of the truth of the Kwangju incident and 
punishment of those responsible for the incident, and injured 
people three times more than that of the Sixth Republic. 
  At the end of May 1993, the civilian government viewed it as 
a crime that South Korean youth and students wanted to 
participate through an international telephone line in the first 
cochairmen delegation's meeting of the National Alliance of 
Youth and Students for the Country's Reunification 
[Pomchonghangnyon] and suppressed them by exercising the 
National Security Law. On 12 June, it mobilized more than 
12,000 combat police to block the northward road of South Korean 
youth and students advancing to Panmunjom in order to attend 
North-South student talks, and arrested more than 370 of them on 
the spot. 
  The civilian fascist regime claimed that the holding of the 
Fourth Pannational Rally in Seoul hosted by the South Korean 
reunification and patriotic forces is also a violation of the 
National Security Law and committed the criminal act of blocking 
the rally. 
  With the National Security Law still in force, numerous 
reunification and patriotic figures have been imprisoned and are 
moaning in 222 police stations, over 3,400 police branches, and 
hundreds of prisons across South Korea. According to the data, 
which was even reduced by the authorities, the South Korean 
prisons are overflowing with prisoners numbering 60,000 to 
70,000. 
  That the civilian regime is only in name is also proven by 
the fact that the Kim Yong-sam ring, like previous military 
fascist dictators, has not disbanded the Agency for National 
Security Planning [NSP] -- the general headquarters of fascist 
suppression -- despite the people's stern denunciation, but 
assumes it as a shield for its survival. 
  Although the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, forced by the 
people's resistance, publicized the reduction of the NSP, in 
actuality, it transferred some of the NSP's functions to various 
offices and agencies of the administration, and posted others in 
research institutes it newly organized. Moreover, it newly 
established the Anti-North Strategic Planning Bureau and 
reorganized and expanded the NSP's structure, thus committing a 
crime. 
  Presently in South Korea, the NSP exists as an oppressive 
organization supporting the civilian regime, which is in a 
crisis. The civilian regime is instigating confrontation between 
fellow countrymen, and works out smear incidents one after 
another. Thus, it is running amok to suppress the patriotic 
reunification forces. 
  The South Korean people will never tolerate the civilian 
regime, which follows the tracks of the Fifth and Sixth 
Republics, and will sternly punish it without fail.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "Undisguised Collusion With </F>
Former Dictators"] 
  [Text] According to a South Korean radio report, on 10 
January, the puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam, in the so-called 
capacity of president, met with Choe Kyu-ha, Chon Tu-hwan and No 
Tae-u, who were in the position of puppet president a long time 
ago, and exchanged views on so-called national administration. 
  In the meeting, the puppet traitor explained the so-called 
supreme goal of national administration and raved that he will 
continue pursuing change and reform in the future, that he will 
work in a fair and square manner, and so forth. Traitor Kim 
Yong-sam also asked for their active cooperation. 
  Expressing sympathy with this, traitors Chon Tu-hwan and No 
Tae-u said that they will not spare active cooperation and 
support and that traitor Kim Yong-sam's broad-mindedness will 
contribute to new political culture, thus praising him. 
  This illustrates that the puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam has 
not 
parted from dictators of the Fifth and Sixth Republics but has 
become the same gang member. This is unbearable mockery and 
challenge to the South Korean people who demand liquidation of 
the Fifth and Sixth Republics' dictatorship and realization of 
social democracy. 
  As is known to all, the South Korean people, only if they 
hear the names of traitors Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, become 
tense with indignation against intolerable crimes of massacre 
and fascist repressive maneuvers they committed against fellow 
countrymen. 
  Traitor Kim Yong-sam's meeting with Chon Tu-hwan and No 
Tae-u 
military hooligans, who are notorious as peerlessly atrocious 
murderers and fascist tyrants, itself evoked surging indignation 
of the South Korean people. 
  The puppet traitor's criminal act again proved that the 
reform drive he has been loudly talking about is a cunning trick 
to deceive the South Korean people. 
  To carry out reform in South Korea, one should, above all, 
eradicate dictators together with the military fascist rule, and 
should abolish fascist evil laws including the National Security 
Law, a remnant of the military fascist rule, as well as 
repressive organizations including the Agency for National 
Security Planning. 
  Nevertheless, traitor Kim Yong-sam further strengthened 
them, 
instead of abolishing them, and bestially oppressed the people's 
just struggle for independence, democracy, and reunification by 
wielding fascist evil laws and mobilizing repressive forces. Not 
satisfied with supporting and protecting the Fifth and Sixth 
Republic dictators, traitor Kim Yong-sam met with the rascals 
and asked for their cooperation, thus acting rashly. 
  A South Korean broadcast reported that during the meeting 
between Kim Yong-sam, No Tae-u, and Chon Tu-hwan, heart-to-heart 
dialogue and jokes were exchanged between them. 
  The fact shows that puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam came into 
collusion as one with the Fifth and Sixth Republic dictators, 
instead of parting from them, and again implemented the 
full-scale military fascist terrorist rule in South Korea under 
cooperation of former dictators from long ago. 
  Feeling very grateful to puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam, 
traitors Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u went so far as to talk about 
his broad- mindedness. 
  The filthy behavior of the puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam who 
fondly talked with Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, objects of the 
South Korean people's indignation and hatred, can be done by 
only a peerless political prostitute and expert betrayer, and it 
can never be tolerable. 
  The puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam said as if he had worked for 
something appreciable for the past 10 months and said he would 
work in a clean and dignified manner in the future, too. This 
is also a shameless deceit. 
  What the puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam has done for the past 
10 
months was nothing more than treachery and selling the county. 
It is traitor Kim Yong-sam that has pursued the North-South 
confrontation and war, not the fatherland's reunification that 
all fellow countrymen earnestly desire. It is also traitor Kim 
Yong-sam that cut off the life line of the six million South 
Korean farmers and South Korean agriculture and has pushed its 
overall economy into a catastrophic crisis by opening the rice 
market, which even preceding dictators could not dare to open. 
  Traitor Kim Yong-sam has been frenzied to bring a nuclear 
calamity to the nation, cruelly infringed upon the South Korean 
people's right to live, far from protecting their freedom and 
right to democracy, and pushed them into the greatest misery. 
It was a nonsense that he said as if he had worked for 
something and said he would work in a clean manner in the future. 
  Just like we cannot expect charity from a wolf, there is 
nothing to expect from traitor Kim Yong-sam who makes it his 
business to sell the country and the nation. 
  Traitor Kim Yong-sam is dashing into treachery harder and 
harder as days go by. 
  Realities show that the South Korean people cannot avoid 
their misfortune and tragedy but be driven to face a worse 
slavish destiny of a colony as long as they leave traitor Kim 
Yong-sam as he is. 
  The South Korean people will definitely deal a hard blow to 
traitor Kim Yong-sam who is trying to dash into a road of 
crueler fascist oppression in collusion with former dictators. 
  Traitor Kim Yong-sam should clearly be aware that the 
superficially attractive pretense of civilian government and 
honeyed words can no longer work. He had batter resign his post 
of power before being given a stern trial by the people.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 10 (KCNA) -- Foreigners who 
visited Korea were struck with wonder at the revolutionary 
spirit of self- reliance and fortitude of the Korean people. 
  Leetooraj Chandramun, president of the Mauritius Communist 
Party, said the Korean people have brought about great changes 
with the chuche idea and the revolutionary spirit of 
self-reliance. 
  Visiting Korea again some 20 years past, he said he never 
imagined that such great changes as he saw today could take 
place there. "I was really surprised at the great reality beyond 
imagination, at the high-rise buildings standing in a row, 
magnificent grand monuments, modern factories and rural 
villages," he said. 
  He stressed it is the unbreakable strength of the Korean 
people armed with the chuche idea and their revolutionary spirit 
of self- reliance that have enabled them to make such great 
achievements under the conditions of national division and in 
face of ever-more malevolent moves of the imperialists to 
isolate and stifle socialism. 
  Genaro Ledesma Izquieta, chairman of the People's Front of 
Workers, Peasants and Students of Peru, after visiting the 
Three- Revolution Exhibition, said the Korean people are making 
everything needed by their own efforts on the basis of the 
independent national economy. 
  P.C. Sharma, chairman of the International Study Centre for 
the Chuche-Oriented Mass Media in Nepal, had this to say: 
  The revolutionary spirit of self-reliance is an indomitable 
faith of the Korean people hardened through a long-drawnout 
struggle. 
  They manufactured lorries, tractors and machine tools by 
highly displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance in 
the difficult postwar period when everything was destroyed. 
  The West Sea Barrage, the May Day Stadium and other amazing 
world's level magnificent grand monumental edifices have been 
created by the Korean people themselves. 
  It can be said that the Korean people's history of creation 
and construction is a history of self-reliance. 
  The chairman of the February Revolutionary Party of Paraguay 
said that as they have an unshakable revolutionary spirit of 
believing in their own strength and living by their own efforts, 
the Korean people are vigorously advancing without the slightest 
vacillation in the present complicated international situation.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 11 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
carries an editorial headlined "Let us Dynamically Advance in 
the Spirit of Chollima Spurred on by the `Speed of the '90s.'" 
  What is important in effecting a new revolutionary upsurge 
in 
all sectors of socialist construction in hearty response to the 
New Year address of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is that 
all the officials, party members and working people make 
continued innovations and uninterrupted progress in the spirit 
of Chollima spurred on by the "speed of the '90s," the editorial 
says, and continues: 
  To make continued innovations and uninterrupted progress in 
the spirit of Chollima spurred on by the "speed of the '90s" -- 
this is an important militant slogan set by the Workers' Party 
of Korea. 
  The party set the next three years as a period of adjustment 
and put forward militant tasks to secure a new base for reaching 
higher levels of socialism by implementing its revolutionary 
economic strategy. 
  Each time they were faced with difficult and vast tasks in 
socialist construction, our people recorded the history of 
socialist construction with heroic feats, closely united around 
the party. In the postwar period when everything was destroyed 
and no bricks were left unbroken, our people brought about a 
great upswing of Chollima, producing what was lacking and 
finding out what was insufficient in the revolutionary spirit of 
self-reliance and hard struggle in reliance on themselves. In 
this way, they successfully built a socialist power independent, 
self-sufficient and self- reliant in national defence. 
  The spirit of Chollima spurred on by the "speed of the '90s" 
is a new speed of progress in socialist construction with the 
spirit of Chollima in the postwar period plus the revolutionary 
zeal and indomitable fighting spirit in the '90s. This reflects 
the noble intention and unshakable will of our party to make the 
first year of the period of adjustment an occasion of a great 
advance in socialist construction by successfully inheriting the 
tradition of the great upswing of our revolution.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 11 (KCNA) -- Coal miners of Korea 
are effecting a great upsurge in production from the beginning 
of the new year. 
  In his New Year address the great leader President Kim 
Il-song set forth a task to decisively increase production by 
making effective use of the existing production foundation and 
creating production capacity still more in the coal industrial 
sector which must advance ahead of the other sectors of the 
national economy. 
  In several days of the New Year alone coal miners in 
different parts increased results of capital tunnelling 1.2 
times, preparatory tunnelling 1.3 times, test drilling 1.4 times 
and coal production 1.2 times, compared with the corresponding 
time of the previous month. 
  The Anju District coal mining complex is overfulfilling its 
daily plan by more than 7 percent these days by operating mining 
equipment at full capacity. 
  The Sunchon District coal mining complex which last year 
tunnelled over 7,000 metres more than the previous year has 
given definite precedence to tunnelling from the beginning of 
the year. 
  The Sinchang coal mine of the complex has carried out its 
daily tunnelling plan at 130 percent in the New Year up until 
now. 
  The Tokchon and Pukchang District coal mining complexes have 
secured new reserve cutting faces and augmented the utility rate 
of mining equipment to boost coal production to a high level. 
  Especially, the Chenam coal mine of the Pukchang District 
coal mining complex this year set itself a goal of increasing 
coal production 50 percent up on last year and is conducting a 
vigorous high-speed tunnelling drive. 
  The coal miners there last year produced 120,000 more tons 
of 
coal than the previous year through the introduction of a belt 
conveyer line in transport and modernization of mining equipment. 
  The South Hamgyong Provincial, Saeppyol, Onsong, Myongchon 
and Kangwon Provincial district coal mining complexes are 
fulfilling their daily plans at 120 to 130 percent by highly 
displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and 
fortitude. 
  New coal mines and pits are under construction vigorously in 
Anju, Sunchon and Pukchang areas and North Hamgyong Province 
which have rich deposits and good mining conditions.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 10 (KCNA) -- Kangwon Province 
situated in central eastern Korea is changing its appearance. 
  In recent years, the province has seen the commissioning of 
the Kumgang motor joint venture company, the Wonsan export 
garment factory, the Anbyon granite factory and many other 
industrial establishments, the reconstruction of the Munpyong 
smeltery, the Tongchon export fisheries station and the Anbyon 
ceramic factory and the expansion of their capacities. 
  The industrial output has been on the yearly increase in the 
province. Last year's industrial output was 8.6 percent above 
the previous year. 
  It has consolidated the foundation of agricultural 
production 
in reliance upon its own farm machine production base capable of 
manufacturing tractors and motors. Grain output has risen 
systematically. The grain harvest last year was 30 percent up 
on the previous year. 
  A progress has been noticed in the fisheries which hold a 
big 
proportion in the economic structure of the province. The 
Wonsan and other fisheries stations have received more 3,750-ton 
stern trawlers and other fishing boats and the area of the sea 
culture has been largely expanded. 
  The cities and rural villages have taken on new looks. 
  The province built dwelling houses for nearly 7,000 families 
last year. 
  High-rise apartment houses of tower, folding screen and 
other 
styles have been built in Tokwon and Kalma districts and other 
places of Wonsan, the seat of the province, adding beauty to the 
port city of culture. 
  Multi-storied houses for hundreds of families and parks and 
recreation grounds have made their appearance in the seats of 
Kosan, Sepo, Tongchon and other counties. 
  Rural villages have changed beyond recognition as socialist 
modern villages. Pongsan-ri, Anbyon County, where multi-storied 
houses supplied with gas are standing in forests of persimmon 
trees looks like a canvas of picture. 
  The province with many beauty spots directs big efforts to 
the construction of tourist resorts. Last year, tourist hotels, 
cultural amusement and welfare facilities were built in scenic 
Mt. Kumgang, Songdowon seabeach and on the bank of lake Sijung. 
  The Wonsan-Mt. Kumgang express highway and other tourist 
roads are available in the province.

  [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- The International Committee of the 
Red Cross (ICRC) denied yesterday the allegation that it helped 
smuggle letters by convicted East Timor rebel leader Jose 
Alexandre "Xanana" Gusmao out of the country. 
  "We have no information on the concerned letters and we only 
found out about them just from reading newspapers," H. Fournier, 
chief ICRC representative in Indonesia, told THE JAKARTA POST. 
  Xanana, who is serving a 20-year jail term at the Cipinang 
Correctional Institution, reportedly wrote letters to Portugal 
and the International Court of Justice pleading for their 
intervention and demanding a new trial by the world court. 
  The letters, whose existence was first disclosed by the 
Portuguese press, have been the subject of an investigation by 
the Indonesian authorities. 
  Director General for Correctional Institutions Baharuddin 
Lopa said the letters were believed to have been sent by Xanana 
through his mother and an ICRC official who visited him at 
Cipinang last month. 
  Fournier said he had received no letters from Xanana's 
mother 
and other family members on a visit to the prison between 
December 8 and December 11, 1993. 
  "The family visit was under supervision of concerned 
authorities at the prison and several officials of the 
Indonesian Red Cross," he said. 
  He said it was true that the ICRC had jointly organized the 
visit to East Timorese detainees at the prison with the local 
Red Cross office, but that it knew nothing about the letters. 
  He said he had also clarified the matter with the Indonesian 
authorities to their entire satisfaction. 
  Armed Forces Commander General Feisal Tanjung said last week 
that he believed the letters to be genuine, but did not rule out 
the possibility that they had been written by someone other than 
Xanana.

  [Text] Jakarta, Jan 12 (OANA-ANTARA) -- President Suharto 
received a nine-member Dutch parliamentary delegation at the 
presidential palace here on Wednesday to discuss bilateral 
economic relations and human rights issues. 
  Wim Deetman, the head of the Dutch delegation, told 
reporters 
after a meeting with the president that the discussions on the 
implementation of human rights in the country were based on the 
principle that Indonesia and the Netherlands are sovereign and 
independent states. 
  "Yes", Deetman said when asked whether the two countries had 
different views on the implementation of human rights. 
  Commenting on Indonesia's decision to reject Dutch aid in 
1992 after the Netherlands' announced suspension of assistance 
to Indonesia in protest of November 12, 1991 incident in Dili, 
capital of East Timor, he said, "That's the fact." 
  The Indonesian Government has since then refused Dutch aid 
on 
the grounds that The Hague had intervened in the country's 
internal affairs. Indonesia considered a Dutch-sponsored 
financial consortium a tool to intimidate Indonesia on human 
rights questions. 
  Meanwhile, House Speaker Wahono told reporters after 
accompanying the Dutch legislators during the meeting with the 
president that the Netherlands remained to respect Indonesia as 
a sovereign and independent state despite the different views on 
the implementation of human rights. 
  They (Dutch legislators) are aware that the implementation 
of 
human rights depends on a number of things, such as the history 
and background of the nation," he said. 
  The head of state and Dutch legislators also discussed a 
possibility of using Rotterdam to serve as a gateway for 
Indonesian export commodities to Europe.

will be placed against Galvao de Mello compared to (Manuel 
Tillman), a Macau (?programmer) who was originally from East 
Timor and has been visiting Dili for the past week. 
  The regional commander hopes Galvao de Mello, who has been 
given the freedom to visit East Timor, will personally observe 
the existing situation there. He also hopes de Mello will then 
clarify to the Portuguese community what he observed without 
distorting any facts. 
  Meanwhile, after a meeting with the regional commander, de 
Mello said his current visit to East Timor has no specific 
bearing and that it was only aimed at further fostering ties 
between Indonesia and Portugal.

  [Text] The government negotiating panel has warned the 
Communist Party of the Philippines-National Democratic Front 
[CPP-NDF] that they may be left out in the government peace 
efforts if they continue to delay the peace process. Ambassador 
Howard Dee, chairman of the government panel, said they are 
still awaiting the response from the NDF leaders to the 
government's letter dated 27 December. Dee said the government 
has agreed in that letter to the holding of preliminary talks in 
Europe primarily to settle issues blocking the holding of 
exploratory talks in Vietnam. Earlier, the government proposed 
to hold the preliminary negotiations with NDF leaders middle of 
this month.

  [Text] Army Chief Arturo Enrile has appealed to the 
communist leaders in the provinces to return to the fold of the 
law and abandon their fugitive way of life in the mountains. 
Enrile issued this appeal following the arrest of communist 
leader Arturo Tabara and seven others in the town of Murcia near 
Bacolod City. Tabara and his group earlier had broken away from 
the group of communist leader Jose Maria Sison. Enrile said the 
arrest of Tabara will certainly have an effect on the ongoing 
peace process. 
  [Begin Enrile recording, in English] Hopefully it will 
create some kind of a bandwagon effect, so that the other 
commands in other areas of the country, hopefully, instead of 
allowing themselves to be captured considering, any way, they 
are really having a difficult time. We are inviting them to 
join the bandwagon already. [end recording].

<F P=106> [By Ramon Tomeldan] </F>
  [Text] The country's balance of payments (BOP) ended with 
a $92 billion deficit last year, a sharp reversal of the $353 
million surplus it posted in 1992, Bangko Sentral [Central Bank] 
Governor Gabriel Singson reported to President Ramos yesterday. 
  A burst of imports averaging 18.9 percent more than the 
previous year mainly eroded the gains from financial and 
non-trade dealings with the rest of the world, according to the 
Bangko Sentral report. 
  Despite this negative turn of events, the Bangko Sentral 
managed to beef up the gross international reserves (GIR) to 
$5.6 billion thus boosting its capability to meet another surge 
of importations this year, the report said. 
  Much of these dollar reserves came from foreign investments 
proceeds exceeding $2 billion. A sizable portion of these 
foreign funds had been placed -- in the stock market and the 
high-yield, zero-risk government securities. 
  Last minute inflows of foreign loans, likewise, augmented 
the 
GIR which peaked at $6.7 billion in April, the report said. 
Among these are the $480 million final tranche of a financial 
sector adjustment loan from the World Bank, with Japan's 
Export-Import Bank and Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) 
as co-financiers. 
  The Bangko Sentral also availed itself of $1.1 billion in 
short-term loans using its gold holdings and securities as 
collateral, to meet local dollar demand and discourage 
speculations. 
  These borrowings caused the foreign debt stock to pile up to 
$34.4 billion as of end-August, from $30.9 billion in 1992, the 
report said. 
  The debt stock picture, however, "remained well within 
acceptable international norms" considering that indicators 
point to the country's sound capability to service its foreign 
obligations, the report said. 
  The debt service ratio, for instance, reached 18.1 percent, 
meaning annual payments for loan principal and interest rates 
equalled that amount of dollar earned, according to the report. 
That would be within the ideal ratio of 20 percent. 
  Singson said in the report that Bangko Sentral's operations 
were marked by the following: 
  -- The financial restructuring of the defunct Central Bank, 
giving rise to the Bangko Sentral as a well-capitalized monetary 
agency; 
  -- Lifting of restrictions on dollar trade as part of the 
continuing deregulation of the foreign exchange sector to 
attract new investments; 
  -- A two percentage point reduction in the reserve 
requirements to ease banks' cost of handling money, and bring 
about a lower interest rate; 
  -- A sharp reduction in the loan rediscounting rate for 
exporters, from 12.8 percent in March to 9.4 percent, coupled 
with an increase in the loan fund to P10 billion [Philippine 
pesos].

  [Text] The Association of Job Placement Companies has 
reported that Thai workers are encountering difficulties in 
obtaining visas to reenter Libya. Those workers who have 
returned and are now applying for reentry visas are having 
problems. Libya has refused to issue visas to workers whose 
contracts have expired. New job seekers are also encountering 
many problems. They have to wait for a long time to get a visa 
to work there. Job placement companies have been waiting, but 
have not received an answer. This has disrupted the businesses 
of brokers who send Thai workers to work in Libya. The delay in 
issuing visas comes despite the fact that Thai workers are 
skilled and the companies that hired them want them to return 
and complete the projects they were hired for. 
  Thamrongsak Saengthong, owner of (Fa-ez) Thailand Company, 
admits that he can do nothing to help the workers because it is 
up to the Thai Government and the Foreign Ministry to solve the 
problem. He is waiting for the outcome of how the government 
will handle the problem. Job placement companies are confused 
on the issue of Libya. They hope Phaithun Kaeothong, the new 
labor minister, will be able to solve the problem effectively. 
  According to a source at the Labor and Social Welfare 
Ministry, Phaithun Kaeothong made a remark to some high-ranking 
authorities that he is concerned about the problem. The problem 
was discussed at a meeting of the committee in charge of helping 
Thai workers in Libya, chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai 
Wirawan. Phaithun has been informed by the brokers that they 
were told to send all Thai workers home by February, including 
those whose contracts have expired as well as those whose 
contracts are still valid. 
  "Workers whose permits have expired will not be given 
reentry 
visas. As for new workers applying for visas, Libya has not 
rejected their applications, but is just delaying issuing visas. 
As of 4 January, the Labor Ministry instructed its officials in 
Greece to check with Thai workers in Libya and report the facts 
they obtain back to the ministry. Therefore, a report is 
expected this week," the source said. 
  According to the same source, Labor Permanent Secretary 
Sawai 
Phrammani has discussed the matter with his deputy, and they 
agreed to send a team to negotiate with Libya once a report is 
received from the labor attache in Greece. They stressed, 
however, that the issue of Thai workers must be separate from 
that of international relations. 
  "The Libyan attitude is seen as a tactic to pressure 
Thailand 
into working actively to establish diplomatic relations between 
the two countries. The matter was discussed with Libya a long 
time ago, but Thailand has remained quiet about it, especially 
now that it has become a member of the Nonaligned Movement. 
Libya is serious about it. If Thailand makes its position 
clear on diplomatic relations, it is believed the problem of 
Thai workers will be settled," the source said. 
  The Labor Ministry's Job Placement Department reports that 
there are currently about 20,000 Thai workers in Libya. They 
are confused about the Thai Government's attitude. The 
companies say that workers were asking questions after a report 
said that Libya was unhappy with Thailand's policy of following 
America.

  [Text] Just before this newscast, Government House 
Spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa reported on the two major topics 
of discussions during the prime minister's visit to Cambodia. 
The topics concerned cooperation in establishing national 
reconciliation in Cambodia and setting up a mechanism to help 
Thai businessmen participate in Cambodia's economic 
reconstruction. 
  [Begin Aphisit recording] The Cambodian side thanked the 
Thai 
Government for supporting and playing a major role in the 
success of the peace process in Cambodia. The Thai side 
reiterated its desire and clear policy of supporting the 
legitimate Cambodian Government. It will not support any group 
that opposes this government. The government has a policy of 
not interfering in Cambodia's internal affairs. On this issue, 
both sides noted that there have been many claims and reports -- 
particularly by foreign press agencies -- that have led to 
uneasy feelings by both parties. They discussed the fact that 
although their objectives and policies are the same, 
implementation at the border -- which stretches a long way -- 
could be inconsistent. Both governments seek direct 
coordination with each other to achieve a correct understanding 
and avoid having minor events escalate into situations that 
might obstruct good overall relations. 
  On economic issues, the Cambodian side welcomed Thai 
businessmen who have played a role in economic development. It 
informed the Thai Government that it is in the process of 
creating mechanisms, organizations, and laws to govern business 
conduct. This will be the framework for future business 
functions. Regarding contracts that Thai businessmen have made 
with Cambodian parties, the Cambodian Government will not revoke 
them; it will honor its commitments. On those projects that are 
not supported by contracts, regulations will have to be followed 
and contracts will have to be negotiated. 
  The Thai prime minister informed the Cambodian side that in 
addition to existing aid, Thailand will approve imports of 
10,000 tons of soybeans from Cambodia in July and will grant 50 
scholarships. The prime minister pointed out that Cambodia and 
Thai businessmen reap mutual benefits from the activities of the 
businessmen. Those who have violated Cambodian law should be 
strictly prosecuted, while justice should be ensured for those 
who appeared to be involved in dishonest activities but were, in 
fact, innocent. 
  Both sides discussed possible mechanisms to facilitate the 
conduct of trade and business, including the promotion of trade 
at border crossings so that duties can be collected and the 
creation of a mechanism to oversee border problems and ore 
exploration in overlapping sea territories. Regarding the 
Mekong committee, both sides are pleased that China and Burma 
have joined. Both sides want quick implementation on these 
issues. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] THE Board of Investment (BOI) is willing to 
help Cambodia screen Thais wanting to invest in Cambodia, 
secretary-general Sataphon Kawitanon said yesterday. 
  Mr Sataphon made the offer on the eve of Prime Minister 
Chuan 
Likphai's visit to Cambodia this week. 
  The 56 Thai businessmen who will accompany the Premier on 
the 
three-day visit will participate in a seminar on regulations and 
prospects for trade and investment in Cambodia. 
  During the visit, the Foreign Ministry will sign an 
agreement 
to set up a joint commission on bilateral relations. 
  Mr Sataphon said the seminar is being held by the Cambodian 
Government in cooperation with the Thai Embassy and the BOI to 
attract Thai investors to Cambodia. The Government was formed 
in November last year. 
  It will give Thai investors "who have good intentions" an 
opportunity to learn more about new investment regulations in 
Cambodia. 
  He said he hoped the Prime Minister's visit would strengthen 
relations between Thailand and Cambodia and result in more 
investment cooperation. 
  He said the BOI is aware of Cambodia's concern about "Thai 
opportunists" who are taking advantage of Cambodians. He hoped 
that a new group of Thai investors will replace the bad ones. 
[passage omitted] 
  According to the Thai Commercial Counsellor's Office in 
Phnom 
Penh Thais had invested in 617 projects in Cambodia as of 
October last year. Hotels accounted for most of the projects, 
71, followed by 64 banking projects. 
  In the first quarter of last year, there were 589 foreign 
projects, of which Thais had 21.4 percent, Cambodians 16.1 
percent, Singaporeans 13 percent, Hong Kong people 11.9 percent, 
and joint ventures between foreigners and Khmer accounted for 
1.4 percent. 
  Mr Sataphon said the BOI has not yet signed agreements with 
the new National Investment Committee on investment cooperation 
because the Cambodian Government is improving its investment law 
and restructuring. 
  He said that if the Cambodian Government wants the BOI to 
help screen Thai investors, it is willing to do so. 
  Thai businessmen should explore partnerships with Cambodians 
and long-term investments to benefit both sides, he said. 
  The BOI and Cambodia's investment agencies have closely 
cooperated on investment for a long time. Cambodia sent 
officials to study the management and investment law of the BOI 
last year, and Phnom Penh is planning to offer investment 
privileges through a similar agency to Thailand's BOI. 
  The 56 businessmen who will accompany Mr Chuan include 
Ital-Thai Development Corp chairman Chaiyut Kanasut, C. Thong 
Phanit Ltd Part &amp; Group chairman Dilok Mahadamrongkun, Samat 
Corporation Plc managing director Thawatchai Wilailak, Chinnawat 
International Co chairman Phaibun Limpaphayom, and executives of 
Bangkok Bank, Bank of Ayudhya, Saha Phattana Phibun, PTT 
Exploration and Production Plc, 3M Thailand and Seagate 
Technology Thailand. 
  The BOI said the businessmen are interested in construction, 
hotels and tourism, cold storage and fisheries, furniture and 
wood products, telecommunications, jewellery cosmetics, real 
estate, rubber, steel, trading companies, automobiles, finance, 
household goods and electronics.

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak has 
formally asked his Malaysian counterpart to ease some 
restrictions on border trade in the spirit of the Economic 
Growth Triangle programme. 
  Dr Suphachai said he expects the next ministerial-level 
meeting of the Growth Triangle -- Thailand, Malaysia and 
Indonesia -- to formulate policies to enhance cooperation in 
cost saving, trade, investment, industry, energy, tourism and 
farming. 
  He said longer opening hours at border checkpoints and lower 
tariffs would be a first step towards better Thai-Malaysia trade. 
  Malaysia wants to shift some of its electronic industry to 
Chalung Industrial Estate in Thailand. But some Malaysian 
businesses say the estate is too small and land prices are too 
high, Dr Suphachai said. 
  Some Malaysian companies have been buying land in Sungai 
Kolok to build a parts factory, he said. 
  Turning to Indonesia, Dr Suphachai said he expected joint 
development in power plants, air services and joint fishing 
ventures.

  [Text] THE Cabinet yesterday endorsed a proposal to 
establish an Intellectual Property [IPR] and International Trade 
Court to improve intellectual property protection. 
  The court will oversee cases concerning violations of 
intellectual property rights in both the criminal and civil 
courts. 
  It will also help to speed up judiciary proceedings as it 
will rule on cases within one week of receiving testimony. The 
entire process will take six months. 
  The establishment of the new court under the Justice 
Ministry 
now only needs ministerial approval. 
  Among ways to speed up the judicial process in the proposed 
court are: 
  -- Sending a court notice through the post, which will be 20 
days faster than by handing it over by a limited team of 
messengers. 
  -- The court will have witnesses testifying every day 
instead 
of postponing cases. 
  The committee working on the new court is at present 
studying 
the process and the types of cases to come under the new court's 
jurisdiction. The qualifications of the judges are also being 
considered. 
  The Justice Ministry has already created a new division to 
oversee intellectual property rights cases.

  [Text] Suva, Jan 12 (AFP) -- Former Fijian prime minister 
Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara was appointed president here Wednesday by 
a unanimous vote of the Great Council of Chiefs, which holds 
paramount authority under the country's constitution. 
  Mara, 73, had been acting as head of state since December, 
when former president and high chief Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau 
travelled to the United States for leukaemia treatment. He died 
in Washington on December 16. 
  "Ratu Sir Kamisese, with all his experience in international 
politics, will continue where Ratu Sir Penaia left off," said 
Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, who chaired the chiefs' meeting 
as minister for Fijian affairs. 
  Mara was prime minister when Fiji gained independence from 
Britain on October 10, 1970 and held the position until 1987 
when his National Alliance Party was defeated by a coalition 
which had the support of the country's large ethnic Indian 
community. 
  Within weeks, the coalition, led by Timoci Bavadra, was 
toppled by troops led by then Brigadier Rabuka, who declared 
Fiji a republic in October 1987. 
  Mara was appointed head of an interim government and held 
the 
post until 1992, when parliamentary rule was restored in a 
general election. 
  The new president's only competition was his brother-in-law 
and high-chief Ratu Mosese Tuisowau, whose nomination did not 
surface at the meeting although his name had been forwarded by 
the rival Great Council of Viti Levu Chiefs. 
  The rival council is made up of chiefs on the main island of 
Viti Levu. 
  On July 25 1990, a new constitution was promulgated in Fiji 
giving indigenous Fijians the right to hold the prime 
ministership and a guaranteed majority of 37 seats in the 
70-member parliament. 
  Twenty-seven seats are reserved for Fijians of Indian 
descent, who first arrived from India as indentured labourers 
for the former British colonial powers in the late 19th century, 
and who are about as numerous as native Fijians. 
  The other six seats are held by Europeans and other small 
minorities.

third round of their official contacts to negotiate over the 
nuclear inspection issue on 13 January. 
  Regarding this, IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said that North 
Korea had not informed the IAEA of a date for the next contact, 
but he expected that they will have another contact in the 
weekend, at the latest. 
  As the North Korean position and the inspection targets 
demanded [sachal yogu hangmok] by the IAEA were clearly 
expressed to each side in writing during the first and second 
rounds of their contacts, they are expected to hold intensive 
negotiations to narrow the differences between the two during 
the third contact.

  [Text] The Japan-U.S. economic consultations are to face a 
major hurdle this week, with the vice ministerial-level meeting 
on automobiles and auto parts -- the issue of most concern in 
the economic framework talks -- to be held in Tokyo for four 
days from 11 January. 
  Jeffrey Garten, U.S. under secretary of commerce, who 
represents the U.S. Government, wants to meet with top 
executives of major auto manufacturers like Toyota Motor 
Corporation while in Japan, in order to talk directly with the 
industry on the question of buying U.S.-made parts--the question 
on which government-level talks are making no headway. The 
Japanese Government, on the other hand, wants to reaffirm its 
position of not adopting any plans on procuring U.S.-made parts 
for 1995 and thereafter. 
  Meanwhile, in the area of construction, while the deadline 
for the U.S. Government deciding whether to retaliate against 
Japan or not is drawing near to 20 January, informal 
working-level talks have started in Tokyo, and the Japanese 
Government will make final efforts to prevent eventual 
retaliation. 
  Under Secretary Garten will meet with Japanese Government 
officials like Sozaburo Okamatsu, deputy vice minister for 
international trade and industry, in the formal talks, but has 
also asked to meet with people like Tatsuro Toyoda, president of 
Toyota Motor, and Nobuhiko Kawamoto, president of Honda Motor 
Company. He claims the primary purpose of the meeting is to 
hear auto industry views, but it is possible he will personally 
ask the industry to expand the purchase of U.S.-made products. 
Specifically, the United States is hopeful that Japan's plan of 
buying "about $19 billion in 1994" will be continued into 1995 
and thereafter. 
  On the contrary, the Japanese Government is poised to reject 
continued setting of such a purchase plan in the vice 
ministerial-level meeting. Even on the question of setting 
objective criteria as a way of measuring the extent of market 
liberalization, the government will persist in the position: 
"Criteria that can lead to agreeing on targets cannot be 
accepted" (to quote an official of the Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry). 
  In fact, Under Secretary of State Spero, who is one of the 
U.S. officials in charge of the framework talks, arrived before 
Under Secretary of Commerce Garten; and during her 10-12 January 
stay, is due to meet with people from political and business 
circles like Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of 
Economic Organizations of Japan [Keidanren], as well as Deputy 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Hatoyama. In the meetings, she is 
expected to urge facilitation of the framework talks, while 
calling for prompt action to stimulate the economy. 
  Some people interpret this position of U.S. officials 
wanting 
to deal directly with Japanese industry, as a "revelation of 
mistrust in Japanese bureaucrats," and government offices like 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Finance are becoming 
alarmed. 
  One goal in the economic framework talks is to enable the 
Japan-U.S. summit--to be held in Washington on 11 February--to 
announce an agreement on the three top priority areas of 
automobiles and auto parts, insurance, and government 
procurements. Both the Japanese and U.S. Governments agree that 
"by all means, we must come to a successful conclusion" (to 
quote an official of the Foreign Ministry), but, so far, not 
much progress has been made even though only one month is left 
before the summit.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "A Weak Yen Gives Export Industries </F>
Breathing Space"] 
  [Text] The exchange rate of the yen against the dollar, 
which hit a record low of 100 yen per dollar last August, has 
maintained a level of 113 yen per dollar from the beginning of 
this year. The automobile, household electrical appliance, and 
steel industries, which suffered a heavy blow from the drastic 
appreciation of the yen, see the weakness of the yen as 
temporary, providing them some breathing space. Nonetheless, 
they show no signs of changing their restructuring plans to 
streamline their businesses, cut their employees, or increase 
their overseas production. 
<H5>  Automobiles </H5>
  The prevailing view in the automobile industry is that "even 
though the yen cannot be considered weak in terms of its current 
rate of exchange with the dollar, the exchange rate is working 
favorably for us" (Muneo Munekuni, vice president of Honda Motor 
Company). 
  The automobile industry is strongly hoping for a return to 
the level of 120 yen per dollar. From mid-December last year, 
when the exchange rate fell to 110 yen per dollar, Toyota Motor 
Corporation and Nissan Motor Company have announced their plans 
to raise the prices of their cars in the American market after 
suffering a fall in their export earnings. 
  The trend of a weak yen, although small in scale, is working 
favorably for the management of each automaker. Tatsuro Toyoda, 
president of Toyota Motor Corporation, says: "With the trend of 
a weak yen appearing, conditions are being created in which we 
can restore our business performance." 
  Each automaker has compiled its budget in anticipation that 
the yen will continue to appreciate against the dollar during 
the latter half of fiscal year 1993. While Toyota Motor 
Corporation has anticipated an exchange rate of 110 yen per 
dollar, Nissan Motor Company anticipates 105, while Mazda Motor 
Corporation foresees 108. For every unit the yen depreciates, it 
is possible for each automaker to reap earnings of 3-10 billion 
yen. 
  Whenever the yen has appreciated in the past, each automaker 
has overcome difficulties resulting from the appreciation by 
simply reducing exports and increasing overseas production. If 
the automakers stop exporting cars amid a decline in domestic 
production, employee redundancy and a surplus of production 
equipment will result. 
<H5>  Household Electrical Appliances </H5>
  Toshiba Corporation, which loses about 4-4.5 billion yen for 
each yen unit of appreciation, welcomes the weak yen, saying: 
"We feel helped a bit by the weak yen. The weak yen will 
increase our ordinary income. Our profits are expected to 
exceed our losses due to the difference in the quotations in our 
exchange contracts." Many household electric appliance 
manufacturers have compiled their respective budgets in 
anticipation that the dollar-yen exchange rate will continue to 
hover around 105 yen per dollar during the later half of this 
year. 
  Sony Corporation, meanwhile, is a bit pessimistic. The major 
consumer electronics maker says: "We have suffered a great loss 
from differences in quotations because we have concluded 
exchange contracts at about 108 yen per dollar. The current 
weakness of the yen will not generate an immediate effect of 
improving our performance." 
  President Takashi Kitaoka of Sanyo Electric Co. Ltd. said: 
"We expect that the weak yen will put an end to our sluggish 
exports; however, we are not supposed to fully boost exports 
because the latest appreciation of the yen was triggered by the 
growth of the nation's trade surplus." 
<H5>  Steel </H5>
  The current weakness of the yen is giving breathing space to 
seamless pipe makers in the steel industry. The drastic 
appreciation of the yen is expected to cause a loss of more than 
10 billion yen for each seamless pipe maker in its 1994 
January-March settlement of account. Therefore, seamless pipe 
makers have begun studying the possibility of lowering 
production while continuing their efforts to cut costs. An 
executive of NKK [Nippon Kokan Limited] Corporation says: "If 
the exchange rate between the yen and the dollar stands at 120 
yen per dollar, we can manage to withstand international 
competition. The yen has depreciated by 10 units from the time 
its appreciation peaked last year, and this will help us reap 3 
billion yen in profits. We hope the yen will depreciate a 
little more." 
<H5>  Chemicals, Textiles </H5>
  Chemical and textile industries are proceeding with their 
plans to move their production overseas. Asahi Chemical 
Industry Company, for example, is now promoting a project in 
China to produce nylon material, and is forging a partnership 
with Du Pont in the United States to produce chemical products 
in Southeast Asia. Reiichi Yumikura, president of Asahi 
Chemical Industry Company, says definitively: "A small 
depreciation of the yen cannot lead to a change in our business 
strategy." Now that Japan is committed to lowering tariffs on 
imported chemical products following the conclusion of the 
Uruguay Round (the multilateral trade negotiations of GATT), 
companies in the chemical industry find themselves in a 
situation where they cannot back away from plans to streamline 
their businesses and bolster their competitiveness.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 11 KYODO -- Visiting U.S. Sen. John 
Rockefeller, a Democrat from West Virginia, on Tuesday [11 
January] urged Japan to take concrete steps to ensure that 
Japan's chronic trade surpus with the United States is whittled 
down in coming years. 
  Foreign Ministry officials said Rockefeller, a veteran 
member 
of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, 
made the request in a meeting with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  Rockefeller pointed to the importance of the upcoming summit 
between President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa slated for February 11 for alleviating any irritants 
between the two countries, they said. 
  In reply, Hata said Japan recognized the "need to bolster 
the 
transparency" of bidding procedures for the construction market, 
to which the Clinton administration has been demanding greater 
access for American contractors, they said. 
  The minister also pointed out that Japan's plan to proceed 
with deregulation, loosening various curbs binding the hands of 
Japanese businesses and society will help improve the relations 
with the United States. 
  Rockefeller, a Harvard graduate who studied at International 
Christian University in Tokyo from 1957 to 1960, is noted for 
his familiarity with Japanese political affairs.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 12 (KCNA) -- The U.S. 
imperialists on January 9 staged a provocative electronic 
warfare exercise against the northern half of Korea in the sky 
above South Korea with an overseas-based "EA-6" [expansion 
unknown] electronic jamming plane, according to military sources. 
  That day, a Pacific-based electronic jamming plane of the 
U.S. Seventh fleet, flying above Suwon, Hoengsong and Chunchon 
of South Korea, jammed the areas. Synchronising with this, an 
"EH-60" [expansion unknown] electronic jamming plane based in 
South Korea created electronic jamming in the areas near the 
Demilitarized Zone along the Military Demarcation Line with the 
skies above Paju and Pochon as an operational theatre. In the 
wake of this, formations of Japan-based VTOL [vertical takeoff 
and landing] assault planes and pursuit-assault planes staged a 
drill of an intensive surprise attack on targets in the areas 
under electronic jamming. 
  This reckless war game reveals the bellicose nature of the 
U.S. imperialists as warmaniacs.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 11 (KCNA) -- A message came to 
the North side headquarters of the National Alliance for the 
Country's Reunification (Pomminnyon) on January 7 from the 
overseas headquarters of Pomminnyon, proposing to set 1994 as a 
year of great national unity for the reunification of the 
country. 
  The message says that when the allied foreign forces led by 
the United States invented a "nuclear suspicion" against the 
North and successively raised hysteric nuclear and war clamours 
one after another from the beginning of last year on that 
pretext in a bid to inflict the holocaust of a nuclear war on 
the territory of the homeland, Pomminnyon lifted up voices of 
anti-war and peace at home and abroad together with all the 
fellow countrymen, defending the banner of national independence. 
  The new year 1994 is a very meaningful year, one year to go 
till the first year of reunification which Pomminnyon declared 
before the nation when raising the anchor to set sail, the 
message says, and continues: 
  The new year has come, but reunification will not come by 
itself for us, and no outside forces will make a present of 
reunification to our nation. 
  The United States, on the pretext of the invented "nuclear 
suspicion" against the North, is creating an atmosphere of 
distrust and confrontation within our nation and increasing the 
political and military tensions. Taking advantage of it, the 
South side's authorities are resorting to all despicable means 
and methods like opening the rice market, on which the right of 
peasants to existence hinges, to the United States, while 
persistently trying to maintain an "international cooperation 
system" to harm and stifle the fellow countrymen. 
  The present-day situation requires that all our fellow 
countrymen vigorously advance along the patriotic road of 
reunification, more firmly united than before under the banner 
of great national unity. 
  The overseas headquarters of Pomminnyon respectfully 
proposes 
to the South and North sides to set 1994, the eve year of 1995, 
the first year of reunification, as a year of great national 
unity for national reunification and jointly conduct the 
movement to unite the whole nation as one. 
  We firmly believe that the call of the overseas side 
proposing the new year as a year of great national unity for 
national reunification will meet with full support and response 
from the Pomminnyon organisations in the South and North.

especially in the fields of infrastructure construction services 
and real estate. 
  Mr. Aldrich highly valued the achievements recorded by the 
Vietnamese Government and people in socio-economic development, 
especially in 1993. He expressed the US businesses' attention 
to the orientation of Vietnam's socio-economic development in 
the period of 1994-1995, and the role of the state economic 
sectors in the market-oriented economy and investment prospects 
when the US embargo is lifted.

would continue its multilateral, open foreign policy. Referring 
to the US-Vietnam relations, Vice Prime Minister Khai said that 
Vietnam would be ready to normalize the US-Vietnam relations, 
and Vietnam hoped that the US Government would do the same in 
the interests of the two peoples, as well as of peace and 
progress in the world as a whole.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 31 Dec -- Despite the socio-political 
difficulties which Mongolia is going through, Mongolian society 
is completing the fifth year of democratic reform, having 
preserved its unity and political stability, President 
Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat said. In his New Year address he said 
that the formation of the top state power structures have been 
completed on the basis of the new constitution and that 
foundations have been created for implementing the concept of 
division of functions between power structures, as recorded in 
the constitution. 
  However, many of the plans have not succeeded the president 
admitted. Therefore, the coming year should become "a turning 
point in the process of the stabilization and further 
development of the economy." The task of raising living 
standards is on the agenda, together with providing guarantees 
of their rights and freedoms to every citizen and ensuring peace 
and security. 
  As the process of reform in Mongolia is irreversible, so is 
its peaceful foreign policy, he said. It is our wish to 
continue developing mutually advantageous cooperation on equal 
terms with all states, including our neighbors - Russia and 
China. "As the president of Mongolia, I welcome the adoption of 
the new constitution by the citizens of Russia," he said.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, Jan. 12 KYODO -- Mongolia's economy 
contracted 8.1 percent last year from a year before as the 
country's shift to a market-oriented economy continued to create 
confusion, the government's statistics bureau said Wednesday [12 
January]. 
  The statistics compilers also cited as a factor in the 
economic ordeal a decline in supplies from Russia of materials 
used for manufactured goods. 
  Cattle breeding, the nation's key industry, suffered a bad 
year due to the unusually cold spring, with the number of 
livestock plunging 520,000 to 25.17 million. 
  Industrial production tumbled 13 percent, while the jobless 
rate rose to 8 percent. 
  Retail prices saw a 2.8-fold increase. The price level was 
18.4 times higher than 1991. 
  Last year's merchandise trade also shrank 10.5 percent from 
a 
year earlier to 722.4 million dollars in terms of value. 
  Exports totaled 360.9 million dollars and imports came to 
361.5 million dollars, leaving the nation with a slight trade 
deficit. 
  Borrowings from international institutions and other 
countries amounted to 38.1 million dollars and grants 55.7 
million dollars. Japan was the biggest donor, accounting for 
more than half of the borrowings and 37.7 percent of the grants.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 11 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's chief 
envoy for nuclear affairs leaves for Washington on Wednesday [12 
January] for bilateral consultations before the next North 
Korea- U.S. high-level nuclear talks, Foreign Ministry 
officials said Tuesday. 
  Amb. Kim Sam-hun and working-level aides will meet with 
Robert Gallucci, assistant secretary of state and top U.S. 
negotiator in the nuclear talks with Pyongyang, and other White 
House and administrative officials to tune their positions. 
  The next North Korea-U.S. high-level talks, expected soon 
after Pyongyang agrees to resume inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), will be the third 
round of such meetings. 
  Seoul and Washington officials have said this meeting will 
discuss overall issues related to completely solving the North 
Korean nuclear problem, including U.S. relations improvement 
with the Stalinist state. 
  North Korean Embassy officials in Vienna held a second 
contact with IAEA headquarters Monday [10 January] and are said 
to be nearing an accord on resuming the inspections, suspended 
in March last year. 
  Another set of working-level talks between North Korea and 
the United States will precede the high-level meeting, and Kim 
will coordinate stances for both of these talks during his 
Washington trip, officials said.

  [Text] This morning, some 50 citizens and students 
belonging to the Pusan Alliance for Democracy and National 
Reunification visited the American Consulate located in 
Taechong-tong, Chung-ku, Pusan and demanded that the United 
States apologize for the unfair ruling recently imposed by a 
U.S. court against Ilchin Company, an enterprise that produces 
synthetic diamonds, and that it suspend the implementation of 
super Section 301. 
  An open letter to the Clinton administration declares that 
the U.S. court's ruling ordering the Ilchin Company to suspend 
the production of synthetic diamonds and abolish its production 
facilities, as well as implementing super Section 301, is an 
economic aggression act against small and weak countries in an 
effort to ease the economic crisis of the United States, which 
the Pusan Alliance for Democracy and National Reunification 
decided to struggle against.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 (YONHAP) -- Pyongyang is unlikely to 
agree to resume talks with Tokyo on normalizing diplomatic 
relations because the North Korean leadership has a bad 
impression of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's cabinet, the 
YOMIURI SHIMBUN said Wednesday. 
  The daily quoted informed sources as saying that Pyongyang 
sees the Japan Renewal Party (JRP), the main force in Hosokawa's 
coalition government, as a lackey of the United States. 
  Further sullying Pyongyang's impression of the Japanese 
leadership was the failure of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), 
which had been friendly with North Korea, to form a coalition 
with the JRP. 
  YOMIURI quoted the sources as speculating that this is the 
reason Chochongnyon (Federation of pro-Pyongyang Korean 
Residents in Japan) did not attend the SDP national convention 
on Tuesday. 
  Negotiations between North Korea and Japan, suspended in 
Nov. 
1992, and exchanges between parties of the two nations were thus 
unlikely to resume in the near future, the article said. 
  It quoted a Foreign Ministry official as saying that it was 
an unexpected situation because the JRP and SDP had close 
relations with Pyongyang. 
  The two parties paved the way for the Pyongyang-Tokyo talks 
on normalization of ties after Shin Kanemaru, vice chairman of 
the then-ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), visited 
Pyongyang in the autumn of 1990. 
  YOMIURI said that its sources were two SDP and JRP officials 
who had met with senior North Korean officials in charge of 
diplomacy since the Supreme People's Assembly renewed the North 
Korean leadership last month. 
  They said that the North Korean leadership considers 
relations with Japan "below zero," compared to inter-Korean 
talks or to its negotiations with Washington. 
  They quoted a Pyongyang official as saying that the Hosokawa 
government was worse than its LDP predecessor and the SDP cannot 
be considered friendly to the Workers' (Communist) Party. 
  This official called JRP Chairman Ichiro Ozawa a puppet of 
the United States, which he said dresses in the clothes of the 
United Nations, the newspaper quoted the sources as saying.

  The Tokyo TOKYO SHIMBUN quoted a high-ranking official of 
the

was a secret because the contract was made under top secret 
instructions from the Moscow Navy Command.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has signed a 
contract with the Russian Far East-Pacific Fleet headquarters to 
purchase four Russian Fox-Trot-type submarines now in the 
Vladivostok naval yard, the Tokyo SHIMBUN here reported in a 
dispatch from Vladivostok on Wednesday [12 January]. 
  The paper quoted a senior Russian fleet official as saying 
that the contract was concluded at secret instructions from the 
Naval Headquarters in Moscow and that he couldn't disclose the 
price of the 2,500-ton submarines. 
  The official added that ostensibly North Korea is buying the 
vessels for use as scraps. 
  Another fleet official said, however, that North Korea could 
update the submarines and create a new submarine flotilla or 
dismantle them to salvage parts for use in repairing those they 
already have. 
  The four submarines were built in the 1960s. The Russian 
Navy is known to possess 38 Fox-Trot-type conventional attack 
submarines.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 11 (YONHAP) -- A South Korean 
Government official denied Tuesday [11 January] a report that 
North Korean Workers' Party Secretary for South Korean Affairs 
Kim Yong-sun has been replaced with Kang Chu-il. 
  "Kang Chu-il was appointed director of the Reunification 
Front Department last year, but not secretary for South Korean 
Affairs. Kim Yong-sun seems to be still in office," he said. 
  "Usually, the party secretary is also a member of the 
party's 
Central Committee," another official said. "But since 1980, 
there has been no report that Kang was appointed a full member 
or alternate member of the Central Committee." 
  Kim was retained as chairman of the Reunification Policy 
Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly Standing Committee, a 
post traditionally held by the secretary for South Korean 
Affairs, at the Sixth Meeting of the Ninth Supreme People's 
Assembly late last year, according to the second official.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 12 (YONHAP) -- Yi Ki-taek, chairman of 
the main opposition Democratic Party [DP], said Wednesday he is 
prepared to visit North Korea and meet with President Kim 
Il-song to help break the deadlock in inter-Korean relations. 
  "In the advent of the new world order, which will be 
dominated by new regionalism and economic hegemonism, the only 
way for the Korean people to survive is to attain early 
unification of their country," Yi told a New Year's press 
conference. 
  Declaring that South-North economic cooperation is the only 
way for both Koreas to survive in the world economic war, Yi 
urged the Seoul Government to pursue a parallel policy of 
resolving the North Korean nuclear issue and inter-Korean 
economic cooperation. 
  He suggested that South and North Korea open special areas 
for investment by both sides. 
  "The Democratic Party placed its overall goal for this year 
on preparing national systems for the era of 
internationalization," Yi said. 
  The party will work for political reform for clean 
politicking, reorganization of government agencies to cope with 
internationalization, reform for economic structural 
organization, stability in ordinary citizen's lives and measures 
for farmers and fishermen, he said. 
  It will also try to realize an "era of localization," 
prepare 
for unification, and establish educational, cultural and 
environmental policies for the 21st century, Yi said. 
  With regard to the reorganization of government agencies, Yi 
said that the country could no longer expect to boost its 
competitive strength under current economic policy, which is 
only preoccupied with statistics for economic growth. 
  In order to open the way for revitalizing the economy, the 
country has to reorganize and strengthen govenment agencies in 
trade, science and technology, education and information fields, 
he said. 
  Yi proposed the formation of an emergency "pan-national" 
economic conference to be participated in by the government, 
political parties and economic organizations to solidify 
national strength. 
  He placed the party's top priority on stabilizing consumer 
prices and recommended a freeze on utility costs and other 
public fees, a reduction of value added tax, improvement for 
commodity distribution systems and cuts in production costs. 
  Pledging the opposition party to try its utmost to block the 
opening of the rice market to imports, Yi demanded that the 
government cancel the uruguay round of trade talks and 
renegotiate agreements on agricultural and livestock trade. 
  The Democratic Party will never ratify the Uruguay Round 
agreement at the National Assembly, Yi said. 
  Commenting on a move to merge opposition parties, Yi said 
the 
Democratic Party will do its best to gather all opposition 
forces. 
  He also called for an extraordinary session of the National 
Assembly to discuss issues the legislature could not handle 
during the just-ended regular session. The issues include the 
so-called Dec. 12, 1979, coup d'etat-like incident, 
irregularities in the Yulgok military buildup program, and 
amendment of political laws.

good opportunity for helping solve the problem in Afghanistan. 
  Badawi added that the forthcoming foreign ministerial 
meeting 
of ECO states in Tehran would be a good occasion for 
collaboration with the association of South East Asian Nations

  The Malaysian official expressed hope that he would visit 
Tehran for the joint economic commission of Iran and Malaysia. 
  The Iranian official in response appreciated the positive 
attitude of the Malaysian Government towards the Islamic

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 12 (YONHAP) -- Yi Ki-taek, chairman of 
the main opposition Democratic Party, is reportedly taking steps 
to visit Pyongyang and meet with North Korean leaders on the 
nuclear issue and inter-Korean economic cooperation. 
  He is trying to get in touch with North Korea through a 
friend outside his party and studying the possibility of meeting 
with a North Korean representative during a visit to Beijing 
around Jan. 20, according to people close to him. 
  His announcement on Wednesday morning that he wanted to 
visit 
North Korea in the new year was not idle talk, they said, but 
the manifestation of a strong desire to improve inter-Korean 
relations by meeting with President Kim Il-song. 
  When the plan is ready for realization, he will consult 
fully 
with the government, they added. 
  "I understand that he has not yet discussed his plan with 
the 
North Koreans," one source said. 
  Another source said Yi was discussing with the Chinese 
Government a plan to visit Beijing next week. 
  "The date of the visit may change because the schedule for 
his meetings with Chinese leaders has not been set," he added. 
  Democratic Party Spokesman Pak Chi-won denied that Yi will 
visit Beijing around Jan. 20, but said a friend was in Beijing 
to arrange a trip to China. 
  Commenting on the reactions of some Democratic Liberal Party 
leaders to Yi's announcement that he wants to visit Pyongyang, 
Pak said that they did not understand the proper role of an 
opposition leader in the effort for national unification. 
  "I hope that the government and its party will remember that 
President Kim Yong-sam made a similar announcement when he was 
in the opposition," Pak said.

  [Excerpts] Kuala Lumpur, Jan 11 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Thailand 
has assured Malaysia that its purchase of aircraft carriers is 
for defence purposes, Deputy Defence Minister Wan Abu Bakar Wan 
Mohamed said Monday. [passage omitted] 
  We understand the defence requirements of the Thais as they 
have got to patrol both the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman 
Sea, he told reporters after discussions with the Thai top brass. 
  Purchased as part of the RTN's modernisation programme, one 
of the helicopter carriers is already being built in Spain and 
is scheduled to be delivered in 1997. This will make Thailand 
the first country in the region to have such vessels. 
  Wan Abu Bakar said Malaysia had also offered RTN the 
facilities of the naval dockyard in Lumut for their vessels 
passing through the Melaka Strait. 
  Both counties, he added, would work together to enhance the 
level of cooperation, especially in joint exercises and in 
anti-piracy operations. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Exclusive interview" with Yi Yong-tok, ROK deputy prime </F>
minister and minister of the National Unification Board, by 
MUNHWA ILBO reporter Kim Kyo-man; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Kim Kyo-man] How much of the work of the National 
Unification Board [NUB] have you been able to grasp since your 
appointment to head the NUB? 
  [Yi Yong-tok] I have grasped the entire organizational 
structure of the NUB and the work each department of the NUB is 
charged with. I am still studying the specific details of the 
policies and strategies related to the inter-Korean dialogue. 
  [Kim] Several days ago you mentioned the North Korean human 
rights issue, touching off some controversy. 
  [Yi] That confirmed for me, the fact that not enough of a 
national consensus about reunification strategy exists. Some 
newspapers supported my view in their editorials and columns 
which led me to think that this was the general opinion, others 
criticized my view. 
  [Kim] You have been a career educator throughout your life. 
How does your background reflect upon your appointment as NUB 
minister? 
  [Yi] Indeed education is my area of specialization. I have 
regarded education in schools as my minor and education in 
society as my major. With that in mind, I founded the Korean 
Educational Development Institute and served as its first 
director for 10 years. In the early 1960's I met Mr. So Yong-hun 
and was involved in Red Cross work. Then I became involved in 
educational broadcasting. These experiences led to my taking up 
of positions like the chair of the Broadcasting Deliberation 
Committee and the first director of the Broadcasting Development 
Institute. I think that this, in addition to my time as the 
South's delegate to the North-South Red Cross talks prior to my 
appointment may have been taken into consideration in my 
selection. 
  [Kim] How long were you in direct contact with the North 
while serving as senior delegate to the Red Cross talks? 
  [Yi] That was from 1984 when the two sides had contacts over 
the relief goods for the flood victims until December 1985 when 
the 10th round of full-dress North-South Red Cross talks were 
held. 
  [Kim] What lessons did you learn from that experience? 
  [Yi] At that time, our primary objective was to hold talks. 
We accepted the flood relief goods only because that would 
enable us to hold talks. The talks were held, but failed to 
result in the improvement of inter-Korean relations. North 
Korea should be held responsible for this. On our part, we 
tried hard not to cause a break up in talks in order to avoid 
being blamed for the break up of talks. Meeting with the North 
delegates then, however, we were led to doubt the usefulness of 
meetings. I think it is now time for the North and the South to 
hold practical and substantial talks in order to achieve real 
reconciliation and to head for reunification. This is why I 
have stated that the days of avoiding words that might displease 
the North Korean side have now passed. 
  [Kim] What reunification policy will you promote? 
  [Yi] I will emphasize two aspects. The first aspect is 
forming an image of a reunified state which we must attain. To 
achieve this South and North Korea must work to show change 
simultaneously. Reunification through absorption means that one 
side will perish. What is important is that the two sides must 
show change and develop according to the current situation. 
Reunification must not be achieved with the result of the 
demise of one side. The legal system and mode of living must 
also change in preparing for reunification. Even though the 
South and North are of completely different systems, with a 
common goal, we can become close. I believe that if this is 
carried out, reunification can be achieved and both sides can 
also survive. 
  Second is the resolution of the issue of separated families. 
South and North Korea are calling for reunification. Therefore, 
I believe that allowing families who have been separated for 
some 40 years without knowing if their families were alive or 
dead, is the most concrete and earnest way for reconciliation. 
If a plan for reconciliation is mapped out based on these two 
aspects, I believe that there will be no problem in the second 
and third stage of the government's three-stage reunification 
method. 
  [Kim] Many people are worried about the relationship between 
the NUB and the Agency for National Security Planning [NSP]. 
  [Yi] I believe there is no problem between the NUB and the 
NSP. We cannot say that one is doing a good job and the other is 
doing a bad job because both organizations are working hard to 
achieve reunification. Since the NUB has primary control of the 
work to achieve reunification, I believe that the NSP must 
cooperate well with the NUB. NSP Director Kim Tok has already 
telephoned me on several occasions and expressed that the NSP 
will cooperate fully. 
  [Kim] Dissidents of the reunification movement are turning 
their attention to what you are saying and doing. How will you 
maintain your relations with them? 
  [Yi] Dissidents are people with diverse opinions. If they 
recognize the direction the government is pursuing to realize a 
reunified state, I believe that dialogue will be able to solve 
everything. On the other hand, I believe that it will be 
difficult to hold talks with people who reject the government's 
reunification effort and who try to overthrow our system. If 
the dissidents agree with the direction of the government's 
effort for reunification, I believe that the difference in 
views, no matter how wide, can be breached.

  [Text] The government is working on a number of 
diversified ways to address the human rights situation in North 
Korea and will take them up step by step in the future, an 
official at the National Unification Board said yesterday [10 
January]. 
  In the initial stage, the source said, the government plans 
to call for improvement of human rights conditions in the North 
in cooperation with international organizations like Amnesty 
International and the International Red Cross. 
  "Through these bodies, Seoul would ask Pyongyang to allow 
visits by human rights inspectors and to stop torture and all 
other forms of maltreatment of prisoners," he said. 
  Another method is to have North Korea accept a human rights 
manifesto applicable to all member countries in return for 
economic cooperation when Northeast Asian multilateral security 
dialogue involving the North is set up, he continued. 
  "When inter-Korean exchanges and cooperation are promoted in 
earnest, the South could extend support to the North with 
emphasis on those areas which could be helpful in elevating the 
quality of North Koreans' lives," he said. 
  "At this stage, efforts could also be made to arrange the 
reunion of dispersed families by South and North Korea without 
linking it to political questions such as the nuclear issue," he 
added. 
  The source said that the Unification Board feels the need to 
think about a method to have the North Korean authorities 
release political prisoners and facilitate the reunion or 
meeting of dispersed families. 
  "Before their integration, West Germany paid 3,440 million 
marks in all to East Germany from 1963 until 1989 to get the 
communist regime to set free 34,000 political prisoners and 
allow the reunion of 250,000 displaced families," he noted.

  [Excerpts] Kota Kinabalu, Saturday -- Deputy Prime Minister 
Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim said today the Barisan Nasional [ruling 
coalition] was set to take over the administration of the Sabah 
state from Parti Bersatu Sabah [Sabah United Party]. Anwar said 
Sabah would have a bright future under a Barisan Nasional 
government. 
  He said the unity of the people would be maintained to 
strengthen the party so that it would be able to take over the 
state. 
  Anwar, who is also finance minister, said the Barisan 
Nasional would continue to safeguard the interests of the people 
of Sabah. 
  "The Barisan Nasional will continue to strengthen unity 
among 
all races in Sabah," he said when addressing a large gathering 
comprising Barisan Nasional leaders and members who braved the 
rain to welcome him at the old airport here this evening. 
  Anwar, who is also UMNO [United Malays National 
Organization] 
deputy president, said unity among the people in the state was 
vital towards ensuring victory over the Parti Bersatu Sabah in 
the next elections. 
  "I thank all of you for coming here to welcome me and I 
think 
the future of the state under the national coalition is bright," 
he said to applause from the crowd. 
  He said the Barisan Nasional wanted Sabah to be as developed 
as other states and that this would not be impossible if the 
people gave their undivided support to the Barisan Nasional. 
[passage omitted] 
  It was Anwar's first official visit here since he was 
appointed deputy prime minister on 1 December. Anwar will visit 
Tawau and Semporna tomorrow before returning to Kuala Lumpur in 
the evening. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Kim Tae-yong] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 12 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Japan are 
studying ways to cope with acid rain and sulfurous acid gas 
coming on the wind from China, and this issue will be on the 
agenda when the Korea-Japan joint committee on environmental 
cooperation meets Jan. 17 in Tokyo. 
  Foreign and domestic studies show that airborne pollutants 
from China account for 30 percent to 50 percent of the acid rain 
that falls upon Korea and Japan, and Seoul signed environmental 
protection pacts with Tokyo and Beijing in June and October last 
year, respectively, to improve environmental cooperation with 
its neighbors. 
  No Chae-sik, president of the Korea Environmental Technology 
Research Institute, has proposed to President Kim Yong-sam that 
there be strict examination of pollutants from China as research 
by domestic and foreign scholars shows that China accounts for 
30 percent of Korea's air pollution. 
  Sim Shang-ku, senior research scientist of the Environment 
Research Center in the Korea Institute of Science and Technology 
(KIST), says recent research by Japan's Central Research 
Institute for Electric Power Industries shows that at least 50 
percent of the materials causing acid rain in Japan are from 
China. 
  The Japanese institute published the results of its research 
on Chinese pollutants in November 1992. It traced the roots of 
sulfureted ions, which cause acid rain, observed at 20 measuring 
points in Japan and found that 50 percent of the ions were from 
China, 15 percent from South Korea and the remainder from Japan. 
  Professor Kim Chong-uk of Seoul National University's 
Graduate School of Environmental Study said in a paper last year 
that the sulfurous acid gas produced in Beijing and two other 
cities and 14 provinces on China's east coast has a great effect 
on the Korean peninsula. 
  "About 92 percent of the sulfurous acid gas from China 
becomes acid rain while the remaining 8 percent affects the 
earth in the form of gas," he wrote. "Shandong and Liaoning 
Provinces, where factories are clustered, especially affect this 
peninsula very much." 
  If the wind blows from China, the acidity of the rain 
falling 
on Paengnyong island off the west coast reaches PH 5.0, he said. 
  South Korea is studying exactly how much sulfurous acid gas 
and acid rain is coming from China, and how much damage they 
cause. 
  Seeking precise data, the National Institute of 
Environmental 
Research will begin a three-year examination of air pollutants 
blown from China and acid rain, using planes, from spring. 
[sentence as received] 
  Professor Yi Kyong-chae of Seoul City University says that 
acid rain appeared only in Seoul and some industrial areas until 
three to four years ago. But these days, acid rain also falls 
in rural areas, including Kwangneung in Kyonggi Province and 
west Kangwon Province. 
  "Unless the government devises countermeasures against acid 
rain caused by pollutants coming from China as soon as possible, 
most of South Korea's pine trees will suffer irreparable 
damage," Yi says. 
  The reason for China's acid rain is that 76 percent of its 
total energy comes from burning coal, which contains a lot of 
sulfur. In 1991, China discharged 16.22 million tons of 
sulfurous acid gas into the atmosphere, about 15 times as much 
as South Korea. 
  China made rapid economic progress in 1992 and 1993, and the 
consumption of coal, of which it has an enormous amount, soared. 
  Seoul National University's Graduate School of Environmental 
Study expects that until 2022, when China's per capita gross 
national product (GNP) will reach 4,000 U.S. dollars, the amount 
of sulfurous acid gas will keep increasing. 
  In contrast, the sulfurous acid gas generated in Korea has 
been dropping since 1990, when desulfurization facilities and 
clean energy were introduced by industry. 
  As time passes, the damage Korea suffers from Chinese 
pollution will grow, according to researchers. 
  To reduce the pollution from China, the Environment Ministry 
has held three Northeast Asian environment conferences, but 
China appears reluctant to do anything about its emissions lest 
economic growth suffer and says that it lacks the capital and 
technology to deal with the problem. 
  In Europe, where 50 percent of airborne pollutants migrate 
across national boundaries, 33 countries signed the convention 
on transboundary air pollutants in 1979. 
  Canada and the United States concluded an agreement to 
sharply reduce air pollutants causing acid rain in 1990.

  [Text] The Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) will be 
acquiring additional F-5 fighter aircraft to replace some of its 
older planes. 
  Mr. Teo Ming Kian, the Defence Ministry's permanent 
secretary 
(Defence Development), said Singapore Aerospace (SAe), which is 
now upgrading the RSAF's existing fleet of F-5 aircraft, will be 
sourcing for additional F-5s to replace some of the older A4-S 
Skyhawks and J65 Hawker Hunters. 
  These aircraft will be phased out in the near future, said 
Mr. Teo in a report in the latest issue of PIONEER magazine. 
  As the United States manufacturer of F-5s, Northrop, has 
stopped production of the aircraft, SAe will source for the 
additional planes from other countries that are planning to 
phase out their own F-5s. 
  Mr. Teo said this during a visit to SAe last month, where he 
was given an update of the progress of the F-5 upgrade project. 
  Apart from its use by the RSAF, the F-5 is still one of the 
front-line interceptors for the air forces of Indonesia, 
Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. 
  These air forces are reported to operate some 400 such 
aircraft. 
  Under the RSAF's upgrading project, which started more than 
four years ago, the first prototype of the upgraded F-5 is 
expected to take to the sky early this year. 
  During his visit, Mr. Teo viewed the prototype with its new 
radar and avionic systems. 
  The new air-intercept radar system gives the aircraft the 
ability to "look down" and detect low-flying targets against a 
stationary background. 
  The avionic systems will be fully computerised. With just 
small finger movements on the throttle, the pilot will be able 
to control all aircraft functions, from the weapons to the radar 
and communication systems. 
  The upgrading of the F-5s, which entered service with the 
air 
force in 1979, is one of Mindef's [Ministry of Defense's] life 
extension programmes, which give older weapon systems a new 
lease of life at a fraction of the cost of acquiring new systems. 
  Work on the F-5 is being jointly undertaken by the Defence 
Technology Group, SAe, and the Defence Ministry's Air Logistics 
Department.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan. 12 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and China 
will have another round of working-level aviation talks here in 
Beijing on Jan. 17-19 to discuss the issue of concluding a 
bilateral aviation agreement, an informed source here said on 
Wednesday [12 January]. 
  "Through their diplomatic channel, the two countries have 
substantially narrowed difference on the question of fixing an 
air control transfer point between them, which had in the past 
been a major obstacle to signing an aviation agreement," the 
source said. 
  The upcoming meeting, therefore, is expected to register a 
major progress, making it possible for the two countries to open 
a direct Seoul-Beijing air route within the first half of this 
year. 
  The source said that Seoul and Beijing have in effect agreed 
to draw the air control transfer point along 124 degrees of east 
longitude so far as the Seoul-Beijing route is concerned. 
  The 124-degree point was determined by the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 1960 and advocated by 
South Korea. But, Beijing had rejected it in the past on the 
ground that the transfer point was set by an ICAO participated 
by Taiwan. 
  For the Seoul-Shanghai route, the two sides have tentatively 
agreed to keep the control transfer point at 125.2 degrees of 
east longitude as now. 
  They also decided to fly chartered planes only, instead of 
regular flights, along the Seoul-Shanghai route, the source said. 
  An official close to Chinese civil aviation authorities said 
prospects are not necessarily bright because China has set forth 
various conditions in return for agreeing to these. 
  "But, since both Seoul and Beijing feel the need to open a 
direct Seoul-Beijing route early, there is much possibility that 
a major breakthrough will be made at the coming talks," the 
official added.

  [Text] Scheduled ferry routes between the ROK and PRC 
connecting Inchon and Dalian, and Pusan and Shanghai will be 
opened in April at the earliest. 
  According to the Korea Maritime and Port Administration and 
the related industry on 9 January, Choyang Shipping, 
representative company of the ROK consortium participating in 
the Inchon-Dalian ferry project, and (Dalian Deep Ocean 
Transportation Corporation), the PRC side's representative 
company, recently held a second-round working-level meeting in 
Seoul and agreed to open the route after deciding to establish 
the joint venture's head office, which was the biggest issue 
blocking the opening of the route, in the ROK while giving the 
PRC side the responsibility of financial manager. They also 
agreed to hold the third-round meeting within this month to make 
the final decisions on how to secure ships and when to begin the 
service. 
  The opening of scheduled ferry services between the ROK and 
the PRC had been agreed in the ROK-PRC maritime meeting held 
last year but it was delayed because the two countries insisted 
that the head office of the 50-50 joint venture should be 
located in their respective countries.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 10 (YONHAP) -- South Korean pollack 
fishing in Russian economic waters resumed Monday after a lapse 
of three years, with 32 vessels from 16 deep sea fishing 
companies casting their nets in the North Okhotsk Sea, off the 
North Kurile Islands and Southeast of Kamchatka peninsula, the 
fisheries administration said. 
  The resumption of pollack fishing will relieve the financial 
difficulties of the fishing companies as a smooth supply is 
expected. 
  The Russian Government approved a 30,000-ton quota for 
Korean 
fishermen in 1992 and a 150,000-ton quota in 1993, but prices 
were not agreed on at a Korea-Russia private meeting so fishing 
did not take place. 
  At a Korea-Russia private meeting in December in Moscow, 
both 
sides agreed Korean vessels would begin catching pollack on Jan.

  [Text] In preparation for the possibility of a large-scale 
oil spill in the territorial waters off the Korean peninsula as 
a result of the increasing amount of oil transport via the sea, 
the government has decided to make efforts to establish a 
Northeast Asian cooperative system to prevent ocean pollution. 
These Asian countries include the ROK, North Korea, Japan, 
China, and Russia. 
  The relevant ministries, including the Ministries of Foreign 
Affairs and Environment and the Korea Maritime and Port 
Administration, said on 9 January that for this end, the 
government would participate in the Northwest-Pacific Ocean 
protection program, a regional cooperative system jointly led by 
the UN Environment Program and International Maritime 
Organization, and that it is positively considering signing an 
agreement to prevent ocean pollution. 
  Accordingly, the government will participate in a meeting of 
the program led by those five countries. This meeting is 
scheduled to be held in May for the first time. In the meeting, 
the government will ask other participating countries to 
establish a comprehensive information management system 
regarding the maritime environment in the Northwest-Pacific 
region, including the East Sea and the Yellow Sea, and to 
formulate an inter-state cooperative plan to prepare for a 
large-scale oil spill. It will give a high priority to this 
project. 
  Also, the government will hold the first working-level 
contact with Japan in Tokyo next month and mainly discuss plans 
to cooperate with Japan to prevent oil spills. The discussions 
will include "the conclusion of an agreement, the exchange of 
technology and information, and the exchange of manpower and 
equipment between the ROK and Japan for the prevention of ocean 
pollution" in case there is a large-scale oil spill on the 
waters.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 12 (YONHAP) -- An international 
consortium whose members include a South Korean consortium, 
Mitsui Co. of Japan and Savage Co. of Australia won the 
exploration rights for a coal mine in Queensland from the 
Queensland State Government in bidding on Jan. 4, the Trade, 
Industry and Energy Ministry said on Wednesday [12 January]. 
  The four members of the Korean consortium are Yukong Ltd., 
Dongbu Industry Co., Hyosung Corp. and the Korea Mining 
Promotion Corp., and they own 33.3 percent of the international 
consortium in equal shares. 
  The mine is 15 kilometers from a railway line, has an 
estimated 770 million tons of soft coal and covers an area of 
475 square km. 
  It is the largest soft coal mine in the world in which 
Korean 
mining companies have a stake. 
  The Ministry predicted that the mine will produce between 4 
million and 5 million tons of coal a year. 
  The Queensland government drilled 105 holes and finished 
exploration at a depth of 18,810 meters. The international 
consortium will drill 200 holes in three to four years. 
  The coal is suited for power generation and steel 
production.

  [Text] The government is planning to establish a nuclear 
control center in preparation for the initiation of simultaneous 
South-North nuclear inspections on related facilities. 
  At the same time, it will push ahead with the export of 
construction, installation and operational technologies for 
nuclear furnaces to Southeast Asia and the development of new 
materials for aircraft. 
  These short- and long-term plans were contained in a 
Chongwadae [presidential offices] report submitted yesterday by 
Science and Technology Minister Kim Si-chung on his ministry's 
New Year policy programs. 
  According to Kim, South Korea has now emerged as the world's 
10th largest user of nuclear power and it is high time that it 
engages in effective "nuclear diplomacy." 
  Along this line, he said, the "Nuclear Control Center" will 
be set up under the umbrella of the Korea Atomic Energy Research 
Institute (KAERI) to initiate preparatory measures for 
South-North nuclear inspections. 
  "In an effort to become more responsible in the application 
of nuclear technology, the center will concentrate on 
formulating new and improved policies," Kim explained. 
  In the area of research and development, the minister told 
President Kim Yong-sam that a total of 322.4 billion won will be 
invested into the development of new materials and precision 
chemical technologies. 
  "One of the main areas of emphasis in research is to 
localize 
technologies which are critical to the enhancement of the 
international competitiveness of the domestic agricultural 
industry," he elaborated. 
  The development of new integrated materials for aircraft 
will 
be tested and put into the commercial market by next year after 
necessary testing procedures are completed. 
  Along with the tangible research, the minister said 221 
billion won will be invested until the year 2010 for the 
introduction of technologies which are on par with those in the 
world's seven most advanced countries. 
  Under the long-term plan, a total of 10 technologies related 
to bioengineering will be developed so as to help the nation 
gain a competitive edge in the international market, Kim 
observed. 
  He said his ministry will also focus on encouraging foreign 
research organizations to open up operations here so as to 
ignite joint research projects with local companies. 
  On the other hand, 40 of the nation's most qualified 
research 
personnel will be dispatched abroad to pick up advanced 
technologies for domestic application. 
  At the university level, the ministry will seek to increase 
the investment in basic sciences from the 7.6 percent last year 
to 12 percent in 1998, introducing such new areas of research as 
space technology. 
  Addressing issues surfacing as a result of the conclusion of 
the Uruguay Round negotiations of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Kim said the financing of research 
projects will be overhauled with particular emphasis on 
intellectual property rights. 
  The minister said a greater portion of the budget will be 
funnelled into the development of environment-related 
technologies such as alternative coolants to chlorofluorocarbons 
(CFCs) to halt further environmental pollution and assist in 
efforts to reverse the damage.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 11 (YONHAP) -- The Foreign Ministry is 
up for major self-surgery, but the doctors have different 
opinions on what to implant and what to excise. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu is said to be contemplating a 
restructuring to fit the Ministry more into the organizational 
mold of advanced countries. One close aide said that the idea 
was to "remove any bureau that no other country has and add new 
ones that most other countries have but we don't." 
  Two key proposals, prepared by different assistant 
ministers, 
agree on installing new bureaus while limiting staff overgrowth 
by reducing the number of superiors. 
  One of the proposals is to establish a diplomatic 
information 
bureau for more effective information gathering and in-depth 
analysis of developments around the world. 
  This proposal recommends what Foreign Ministry officials 
have 
long demanded -- trimming at the top and widening at the bottom 
-- by reducing the number of special-grade I and II ambassadors 
from the current 84. 
  The other proposal is to dramatically strengthen the 
Ministry's economic team by expanding from two bureaus into 
three. 
  Responsibilities will be divided to cover environment and 
technology issues, multilateral trade issues and bilateral trade 
matters. 
  To fill the added posts, the proposal recommends hiring 50 
to 
100 Koreans who have studied or reside abroad with high economic 
training backgrounds. 
  To balance out the bureau and staff increase, this proposal 
wants to merge the European Affairs Bureau with the Middle East 
and African Affairs Bureau. 
  The restructuring plan gained momentum soon after the 
foreign 
minister was retained in the cabinet reshuffle last month. It 
was one of the first things he said he will do after taking 
office in February last year. 
  But there is already opposition to both proposals, 
especially 
to the parts about merging the Regional Affairs Bureau and 
hiring overseas Koreans. The other recommendation, to diminish 
the number of special-grade ambassadors, has and will meet 
staunch opposition from high-level officials, according to 
insiders. 
  The Ministry tried doing this last year to pass the revised 
diplomat employment law by the National Assembly in the summer. 
But the plan was completely foiled when no agreement was 
reached within the Ministry. 
  "The suggestion of combining the European Bureau with the 
Middle East and African Bureau will be like a last blow to staff 
members who already feel neglected and dominated by their 
colleagues in the American and Asian Bureaus," said one 
working-level official. 
  Some insiders are extremely pessimistic about the proposal 
regarding overseas Koreans, educated and residing abroad, 
fearing that they will not only be unable to adapt to the work 
atmosphere but will build animosity with Korean staff who had to 
pass the highly competitive state exam to become diplomats. 
  "Some are saying, what's the point of taking all the trouble 
to pass the exam when foreign-educated people can easily enter 
without having to take the test and take away your career 
opportunities?" an official said.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 12 (YONHAP) -- The procedure for direct 
foreign investment in South Korea will be improved to require 
only the filing of an investment plan with the government, while 
tax breaks and financial support for foreign firms investing in 
high- tech and other specific industries will be greatly 
expanded this year. 
  At present, investors must obtain government approval of 
their investment plan. 
  The foreign exchange market will be further liberalized, 
with 
the exchange rate fluctuation range increased from the current 1 
percent of the previous day's average market rate. 
  To minimize farmers' losses due to market opening, a 
specific 
duty system will be introduced for cheap farm products whereby 
tariffs will be set on the basis of a fixed sum of money for 
each unit of quantity or weight. 
  These are among the salient points of the Finance Ministry's 
operating program that Finance Minister Hong Chae-hyong reported 
to President Kim Yong-sam on Wednesday. 
  Hong said the Citizens National Bank will be denationalized 
and equity totaling 688 billion won of four state-run banks, 
including the Korea Development Bank, in 29 firms will be sold, 
along with equity worth 211.2 billion won in 18 subsidiaries. 
  Ceilings on investment in foreign securities markets by 
institutional investors, such as securities, insurance and 
investment trust companies, will be lifted altogether for free 
investment abroad, and individual investors, now allowed to 
invest in foreign securities only through investment trust 
firms, will be free to invest directly in foreign equity markets. 
  The introduction of foreign commercial loans will be limited 
to importing equipment needed in infrastructure expansion 
projects, while terms of foreign exchange loans from the Bank of 
Korea will be eased for increased capital investment by 
corporations. These loans will be excepted from credit controls. 
  The tax credit system for investment in equipment and plant, 
where 10 percent of the investment cost is deducted from taxable 
profit for small firms and 7 percent for large firms, will be 
extended by the end of the year. 
  All listed firms in the manufacturing sector will be allowed 
to increase their capital by issuing new shares, if they meet 
certain requirements. 
  To stabilize prices and at the same time to ensure smooth 
flow of funds, growth of the total money supply (cash in 
circulation plus demand and time deposits) will be pegged at 
between 14 percent and 17 percent this year, Hong said. 
  Bank loans supporting government policies will be gradually 
reduced, while the Bank of Korea will impose ceilings on 
commercial banks when rediscounting notes they have already 
discounted. 
  Corporations will be allowed to set up sales finance firms 
overseas to help them increase exports, and companies developing 
their own trademarks and designs will be accorded tax breaks to 
encourage such development efforts. 
  Later, Construction Minister Kim U-suk revealed the creation 
of a Computer Data Bank on 25 million lots of land across the 
country by the end of the year in briefing the president on his 
ministry's operating program in 1994. 
  Private capital will be invited for construction of selected 
roads, tunnels and bridges, to make up for fund shortages in 
infrastructure expansion projects, he said.

  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Recently there has been a 
gentle tone in President Kim Young Sam's words (called YS 
hereinafter) often using rhetoric such as "future" and "advance" 
etc. This was rarely seen before. Did he think that he should 
now ease the warlike atmosphere derived from the sudden 
regulations and stringent audits and inspections and the like? 
  Last September 23, at the lunch table in the main building 
of 
the Blue House, YS talked with Chang Sang-tae, the head of the 
Dong Kuk Steel Industry group and the 17th person in a series of 
dialogues between YS and the various heads of financial cliques. 
  It is said that the dialogue between the two men of about 
the 
same age was very peaceful. While they talked about the monetary 
real name system and an economy-stimulating plan, etc., YS 
suddenly digressed from the conversation, striking newsmen's 
ears, "From my childhood I was bred in luxury in the home of an 
operator of a big fishery. Frankly speaking, at that time I 
lived so happily that I would not envy Mr. So-and-so. Why should 
a man like me not be a supporter of capitalism?...." Mr. 
So-and-so in his speech refers to the late head of a financial 
clique and a famous person synonymous of a rich man. 
  If reform opponents heard such a story, they might be 
displeased with him wondering why should he let the rich be 
denounced as moral offenders under his rule. But most ordinary 
people would think that from now on he might appease the rich 
who cowered before reform." 
  This is the first time since YS took office that he spoke 
such gentle words. [passage omitted] 
  He spoke especially to assemblymen Lee Sung-yun (the 
ex-Deputy Prime Minister) and Chung Ho-yong, among others, who 
had suffered from a slip of the tongue in the process of making 
public their personal assets. 
  After a long time, the high-spirited assemblymen began to 
appeal for improvements in the monetary real name system and 
special attention to economic recovery, etc. 
  Assemblyman Lee asked him to be more concerned about the 
economy, and assemblyman Chung appealed for the opportunity to 
talk with an open mind. He probably had much to tell as a person 
of the ruined TK group. This peaceful sight was also a first. 
  Would the flustered assemblymen standing in awe of the Blue 
House have touched YS's heart? In the evening of the 23rd, YS 
invited all the assemblymen of the Democratic Liberal Party to 
the Blue House, holding a similar event as with the Executive 
Members of the Party two days prior. 
  This event was not prepared in advance at all, but prepared 
on the spot, because YS was satisfied with the success of the 
meeting two days earlier. At the end of the talk, YS once again 
said such meaningful words that "thus far the rich might have 
been too criticized." 
  In the first few months after taking office, YS intended to 
spread a new sense of value saying that "anyone in our country 
should not want to have both wealth and honor, and should now 
select one alternative." Six months later, contrary to his 
previous actions, in the process of making public the assets of 
ranking public officials, YS presented a new philosophy that 
"the mere possession of many assets should not prevent anyone 
from becoming a public official." 
  Accordingly, as the assistant Public Prosecutor-General Kim 
Do-un becomes a prospective Public Prosecutor-General after Park 
Jong-chul resigned, YS heard from aides that "his only weakness 
was that he had too many assets" and asked how he got them. The 
aides answered that "there was not problem from a moral point of 
view because most of them were inherited." YS immediately 
promoted and appointed him, saying that "if this was so he was 
all right and this was no problem at all." 
  Judging from such facts, YS seems to be surely changing his 
mind or temporarily using new ways to distinguish his supporters 
and opponents. 
  Therefore those who have seen only the strict side of YS, 
they say, could not understand his present actions. Let's listen 
to a presidential aide. [passage omitted] 
  According to him, YS may be understood as follows. "They 
were 
whipped into shape. Because they realize the consequences, they 
will behave well from now. I will ease up." 
  Asked the same question, another aide commented in more 
simple terms. 
  "The same audit and inspection methods as he ordered in the 
early days after taking office will be no more. While up to now 
he has raised or lowered the standard of audit and inspection 
according to the times and circumstances, he has gradually 
lowered the standard. In short, he seems to intend liquidate the 
past by the end of the year and start with a new hope next year. 
This could be regarded as a period of transition." 
  If so, when would YS's appeasement policy have started? 
  Last August 12 when the monetary real name system was put in 
operation, YS's harsh style began to ease, many people believe. 
Even at that time there were a number of busy activities such as 
making out the audit and inspection schedule for the latter half 
of the year and giving an impetus to the next reform and so on. 
  But as the days went by, more and more people believed that 
the anti-reformers should soon be appeased. Such an opinion was 
originated in the belief that if increasing numbers of the rich 
and ranking public officials look on national policies with 
folded arms and object to the reforms, these reforms might fail. 
  Accordingly, the aides recommended that YS should surely 
talk 
with heads of financial cliques and lower the standard of the 
audit and inspection. 
  YS accepted his advisers' recommendations, because he had 
already blocked any possible evasion of the law by carrying out 
the monetary real name system blitz and making public ranking 
officials' personal assets. 
  He frequently talked with heads of financial cliques. After 
he had said that the government investment enterprises and the 
employers of funds would extensively be audited and inspected in 
the latter half of the year, he only examined in detail the 
assets of the high-ranking officials of the related 
organizations. 
  The talk about the tax investigation of the press companies 
also became disappeared. 
  The Blue House also demanded that even the audit and 
inspection of local indigenous unrighteousness should be 
immediately terminated. The revision of the Fair Trade 
Commission Law and the inquiry into the internal transactions, 
both detrimental to financial cliques, were greatly lessened. 
  The more crucial policy tolerating anti-reformers by YS is 
obvious by the fact that the Blue House dissuaded the Board of 
Audit and Inspection and the Opposition Parties from inquiring 
into the ex-Presidents Chon and No who were related to the Peace 
Dam and Yulgok Project, saying that "causing a sensation was not 
desired." [passage omitted] 
  Although the malfeasance and corruption was not yet all 
exposed, YS has chosen to tolerate and forget the gloomy past 
rather than be indignant and instead decided to move forward to 
a brighter future. What would have led him to change so? 
  Han Fei-zi's ruling techniques especially liked by YS are 
thought to have led him to do so. [passage omitted] 
  Interpreted in a modern version, it may mean that when the 
leadership of a country such as statesmen, ministers and heads 
of financial cliques, etc. do not voluntarily cooperate, the 
ruler should yield and choose the next best policy. 
  Recently YS said to Cardinal Kim Suh-wan who was accompanied 
by Cardinal Soka of the Vatican, "There is definitely resistance 
(in connection with the monetary real name system, etc.) in our 
society. But I think I could conquer such resistance." Once a 
financial institution repaid a deposit to a big creditor with 
forged documents, defying the import of the money real name 
system, YS angrily demanded that such an institution immediately 
be chastised as strictly as possible. Despite the proposed 
improvements of the monetary real name system, he demanded that 
"no additional complementary measures be taken." 
  But his recent policies are more appeaseable than expected. 
He admitted the issue of long term low interest bonds that he 
was said to have so stubbornly opposed and included it in the 
September 24 measure. 
  In taking off the thick overcoats of the resisters, he 
appears to have made use of the warmth of the sunlight instead 
of the strong wind. Therefore some do not think that "YS's 
policy change will be permanent." 
  Such a view is originated in the story that YS does not 
yield 
in carrying out his affairs. That is why many are afraid of YS. 
But it is obvious that the resistants of the reforms made YS 
angry. Even judging from his words of "resister so-and-so" when 
receiving Cardinal Soka, he seems to have had no intention of 
forgiveness. If his recent acts are a temporary strategic 
retreat for the purpose of avoiding any head-on clashes with the 
resisters, he will watch for a chance to strike back. As many 
denounce YS at a meeting of the ordinary assemblymen of the 
Democratic Liberal Party, those of the Democratic Faction of the 
Party pointed out, "Don't kick up a row without knowing the 
truth." This story may mean such a situation.

<F P=106> [By Cho Se-hyon: "Monday's Presidential Get-Together Has </F>
Symbolic Significance"] 
  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 8 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam has 
invited three former presidents for lunch at Chongwadae 
[presidential office] on Monday [10 January] in a symbolic 
gesture that signals an end to phase one of his reform campaign, 
aimed at settling past affairs. 
  Kim, the first civilian chief executive in more than three 
decades, spent the first year of his administration cleaning up 
irregularities and corruption, most committed during the two 
previous administrations led by Army generals. 
  In the second year, Kim obviously wants to embark on the 
construction of "a new Korea," through reconciliation and 
harmony through dialogue. Viewed from this angle, many believe 
Monday's presidential get-together will provide an auspicious 
and extremely well-timed beginning. 
  The luncheon, to be attended only by Kim and former 
presidents Choe Kyu-ha, Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, is expected 
to draw keen public attention as it could provide an opportunity 
for Chon and No to make up their personal animosity. 
  Asked the meaning of the meeting, presidential spokesman Chu 
Ton- sik said, "don't we all know without someone elaborating on 
it?" 
  Politicians are free, of course, to attach any significance 
they wish to the lunch, Chu added. 
  The invitation of Choe to the meeting can be viewed purely 
as 
a courtesy. 
  But with Chon and No, both former presidents were wrongdoers 
when Kim was leader of a democratization movement in the 1980s. 
  Even after the Democratic Liberal Party was formed in 1990 
through a merger of three political parties, including No's 
ruling Democratic Justice Party and Kim's Reunification 
Democratic Party, there was continuous friction between No and 
Kim, who was the DLP chairman, especially during the process of 
selecting the party's standard bearer. 
  Seen from this viewpoint, Monday's meeting is a gesture for 
reconciliation on the part of the current president. 
  Immediately following his inauguration, Kim defined the 
so-called Dec. 12, 1979, affair as "a coup d'etat-like 
incident," putting Chon in a tight position for leading a group 
of lower-ranking Army officers against their superiors and 
grabbing power. 
  Kim also ordered an investigation of the construction of the 
Peace Dam by Chon's administration and possible irregularities 
in the Yulgok military buildup program under No's administration. 
  In the process, many came to fear that a peaceful and 
amicable transfer of power from one president to the next may be 
impossible in this country, and the successor will always expose 
the misrule and irregularities of his predecessor. 
  It was during this process that close friends Chon and No 
became estranged, with Chon imposing exile on himself in a 
remote Buddhist temple and harboring bitter feelings against No 
for not protecting him and his administration from a public 
outcry. 
  As for Kim, the president must realize that he can no longer 
afford to cling to "past affairs" if his administration is to 
march forward and begin to show the "tangible benefits" of 
having civilian government to the people following a year of 
reform and anti- corruption campaigns. 
  Kim must also realize that he now stands at the point where 
he could and should recruit support and take advantage of "the 
experience" of the former presidents for effective execution of 
national policy. 
  Unless he shows the magnanimity by which to reconcile with 
his erstwhile persecutors and have harmonious relations with 
them, he will find it difficult to appeal to the people for 
reconciliation and unity, especially within his own party.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 10 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
had lunch with three former presidents at Chongwadae 
[presidential residence] on Monday, using the occasion to 
explain the policy of his government and seek their support for 
his efforts to strengthen the nation's competitiveness in the 
era of globalization. 
  The president's luncheon guests were former Presidents Choe 
Kyu- ha, Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u. 
  During the two-hour get-together, Kim explained details of 
the reform policy that he put into effect in the first year of 
his administration and told them that the country has to join 
the ranks of advanced nations by boosting its competitive 
strength this year, presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik said. 
  "His administration will continue to pursue changes and 
reform to attain the goal of his national policy," the spokesman 
said Kim told the former presidents. "In order to do so, 
revitalization of the economy, political reconciliation and high 
degree of morality on the part of the people is absolutely 
necessary." 
  Kim asked for active support from the former presidents for 
this goal, Chu said. 
  "I have given my all in the past 10 months," Chu quoted Kim 
as telling the former presidents, pledging that he will remain 
clean and work hard in the remaining four years. 
  The country recorded a trade surplus last year and, since 
there are signs of economic recovery, it is all the more 
important to maintain harmonious labor-management relations, Kim 
told them. 
  Kim also briefed them that the government set an export goal 
of 90 billion U.S. dollars for this year and in order to achieve 
this goal, national unity and solidarity are needed now more 
than any time before. 
  "The government has set aside 42 trillion won for investment 
in the farm and fishing industry as part of measures to cope 
with the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations," 
Kim said. 
  In addition, the country will try to raise another 1.5 
trillion won through a special tax to strengthen the nation's 
agriculture and fisheries, Kim told them. 
  All three former presidents expressed their agreement with 
the plans, Chu said. 
  The three also expressed their satisfaction to President Kim 
for making an opportunity to get together, Chu said. 
  The former presidents said that they believe Kim's broad- 
mindedness will contribute to the development of a new political 
culture and national reconciliation, according to Chu. 
  Monday's presidential get-together was seen as significant 
not only because of its symbolism but also because of perceived 
efforts on the part of President Kim to unify the country and 
reconcile the various factions, some of which could have hurt 
the civilian government's reform policy and anti-corruption 
campaign. 
  In addition, the luncheon attracted unusual public attention 
because it was the first encounter between Chon and No since 
they ran into each other at Kim's inauguration Feb. 25 last year. 
  There has been intense speculation on when, and whether, the 
two former presidents will reconcile. Animosity between the 
erstwhile friends and fellow Army generals developed after No 
succeeded Chon as president in 1988. 
  Chon was said to be angry over what he apparently perceived 
to be a failure by No to protect him when he had to go into 
exile in a remote Buddhist temple amid rising public outcy 
against misrule by his administration. 
  After the meeting Monday, the spokesman told reporters that 
Kim did not refer to "the problem of reconciliation between 
Presidents Chon and No." 
  "President Kim simply observed that it is undesirable for 
the 
public to talk about a good or bad relationship between two 
former presidents," Chu said. 
  Chon told reporters after he returned home from the lunch 
that Kim had suggested a reconciliation and he had replied that 
"it was a good idea." 
  Pressed further whether he intends to reconcile with No, 
Chon 
asked: "Do men like us who have been presidents need a (special) 
opportunity to reconcile? 
  "I believe we can reconcile naturally if we keep meeting at 
occasions like today's. 
  "There was nothing awkward about (my) meeting with President 
No," Chon said, discussing the atmosphere at Monday's meeting. 
"We talked a lot about the North Korean nuclear problem." 
  Chon said he had asked Kim to pay close attention to 
national 
security problems, and Kim was well aware of the importance of 
the security question. 
  No, upon arrival home from Chongwadae, did not talk to 
reporters. 
  An aide, Yi Su-chong, told reporters that No personally was 
very satisfied with Monday's get-together. Yi declined to go 
into the question of reconciliation with Chon.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 11 (YONHAP) -- Former President No Tae-u 
asked President Kim Yong-sam on Monday to "properly manage" the 
cases against former government officials accused of 
irregularities, including former Senior Presidential Secretary 
Kim Chong-in, who is charged with bribery. 
  Kim had lunch with former Presidents No, Chon Tu-hwan and 
Choe Kyu-ha at Chongwadae [presidential office] on Monday, and 
explained the policy of his government. 
  No said he was sorry his people had burdened Kim and blamed 
his own "lack of virtue" for their wrongdoings. 
  Kim did not respond in detail. 
  "The president's unchangeable firm belief is that there 
cannot be exceptions, according to the principle of equity, in 
dealing with those who are on trial for their irregularities and 
obviously violated the law," a member of the presidential staff 
said. "The cases of former government officials will be dealt 
with in strict fairness under the law and according to the 
principle of justice without sanctuary."

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 11 (YONHAP) -- The news media generally 
welcomed President Kim Yong-sam's meeting Monday with three 
former presidents and urged them to use the occasion to start 
working for national harmony and unity. 
  Former Presidents Choe Kyu-ha, Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u 
personify the conflict and yoke that stained the political 
history of South Korea for the last 15 years, some newspapers 
said. 
  Kim had invited the trio to Chongwadae [presidential office] 
for lunch and informal talks, but the news media and general 
public attached significance to the event and used words like 
"great reconciliation" and "great harmony." 
  In addition, Kim invited his predecessors to seek their 
support for his administration's efforts to boost competitive 
strength in the era of globalization through national unity. 
  But below this facade, the TONG-A ILBO could not help 
detecting Kim's political calculation. The daily said in an 
editorial Tuesday that through the last 10 months of 
anti-corruption campaigning Kim has alienated himself from Chon 
and No and must have felt a political burden. 
  In this respect, the presidential get-together could be 
nothing more nor nothing less than a meeting of pro-government 
forces, the TONG-A said, adding that this was why it could not 
but worry that the meeting may force a dispersal rather than a 
concentration of national strength. 
  The TONG-A nevertheless ended its editorial on a hopeful 
note, urging Chon and No to make efforts to make up their 
personal animosity so that the public no longer hears about 
their conflict. 
  Moreover, if the meeting was held to help gather national 
competitive strength within a big framework of reconciliation 
and unity, the newspaper said, the public suspicion or 
impression that Kim has been waging a political vendetta against 
his predecessors under the pretext of an anti-corruption 
campaign has to be cast off. 
  The SEGYE TIMES, in an editorial, said that it did not view 
the meeting as an occasion for simple reconciliation, for it has 
to be reconciliation and cooperation for the future through 
readjustment of personal attitude and self-reform. 
  It should not be a reconciliation that accepts past mistakes 
or wrongdoings as they are, but one based on a thorough self- 
examination and efforts to reborn for the future, it said. 
  A SEOUL SINMUN editorial said angry and fighting politics 
were replaced by politics where there are smiles. There was no 
better sign than that Korean politics have stabilized and 
matured, it said. 
  There were times when chief executives could not go out to 
the public freely and express their own opinions. 
  As one of the persecuted politicians during those 
unfortunate 
days, President Kim has extended his arms to former presidents 
based on his legitimacy and confidence, the SEOUL SINMUN said. 
  Kim's efforts to get the nation back to normal have to be 
evaluated highly, the newspaper added.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 10 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
receives the annual New Year's reports by ministries and 
agencies from Tuesday for the first time since his government 
was inaugurated in February 1993. 
  Chongwadae [presidential office] wants, however, to 
drastically reform the annual reports to better suit a civilian 
government and move away from past practice, which was almost 
ritualized and devoid of substance under the militaristic and 
authoritarian administrations of former Army generals. 
  Instead, the Kim administration wants to introduce "an 
efficient and effective" practice of reporting on annual plans 
by each ministry to the chief executive, Chongwadae officials 
said Monday. 
  The decision is in line with Kim's style, which has 
quickened 
the pace of operating government affairs, including the New 
Year's presidential press conference, the officials explained. 
Unlike previous presidents, Kim gave his press conference in 
the first week of the new year. 
  As a result, the administration plans to cut the period of 
the so-called national policy reports by half, winding them up 
before Jan. 31. In the past, reports to presidents had been 
dragged into February or even March sometimes. 
  The administration hopes to wrap up reports by mayors of big 
cities and provincial governors within February. 
  In order to save time and unnecessary complication, Kim will 
receive reports from two ministries a day, all in the morning, 
at Chongwadae, if possible. In the old days, presidents went 
out to the offices concerned. 
  Of the 28 ministries and agencies, Kim will probably go only 
to the Agriculture and Fisheries, Defense, Home Affairs and 
Education Ministries. The number of officials he will meet will 
also be reduced with heads of offices of planning, and bureau 
chiefs, in addition to, of course, ministers. 
  This year's reports will also rid of "militaristic" charts 
and slides and let ministries be brief and to the point with 
their new year plans, the officials said. 
  One Chongwadae official said that since Kim has already 
elaborated on the administration's goal for this year, which is 
internationalization of the country, the ministries are expected 
to place emphasis on ways to boost competitive strength. 
  Unlike past governments, the Kim administration will check 
the progress of each plan reported by the ministries on a 
quarterly basis, the official said.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 12 (YONHAP) -- The presidential 
secretariat, which appeared to be feeling its way around for the 
first year, is expected to become truely the "hands and feet" of 
President Kim Yong-sam as his civilian administration enters its 
second year. 
  To better assist the president, the secretariat reorganized 
itself Wednesday and created several senior presidential 
secretary positions, one of which will be in charge of 
agricultural and fisheries affairs. 
  Additionally, it merged several secretary posts with 
overlapping turf and changed the names of some of them. 
  To strengthen the planning and coordinating of the chief 
presidential secretary, it created the job of secretary to 
assist the chief aide, and it created the job of woman deputy 
spokesman in the office of the senior press secretary. 
  Under the new position of senior presidential secretary for 
agricultural and fisheries affairs will be three secretaries: 
In charge of farm and fishery policy, agricultural and fishing 
industry, and welfare of farmers and fishermen, respectively. 
  The No. 1 and No. 2 secretaries in charge of publicity under 
the senior secretary for political affairs were merged into one. 
The two secretarial posts in the office of petition and 
information and the two in the office of educational, social and 
cultural affairs were also merged. 
  On the other hand, the job of the secretary for 
party-government affairs under the senior secretary for 
political affairs was divided into two positions. 
  At the same time, Chongwadae changed some of the names. The 
secretary for defense administration in the office of the senior 
secretary for foreign and national security affairs, for 
example, is now the secretary for defense. 
  In addition, the No. 1 and No. 2 publicity secretaries under 
the senior press secretary have changed to the No. 1 and No. 2 
public information secretaries and the overseas information 
secretary to the overseas secretary. 
  Chongwadae has changed the temporary office of the social 
infrastructure planning group under the senior secretary for 
economic affairs into a permanent organization. The temporary 
office of administration reform office under the senior 
secretary of administration affairs will be abolished in April, 
as planned. 
  The secretary for overseas Korean affairs under the senior 
secretary for foreign and national security affairs will be 
concurrently the secretary of international security affairs for 
the time being. 
  As a result of the reorganization, the number of secretaries 
rose from 49 to 51 but the actual number of presidential staff 
will drop as some administrative officer posts were cut.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 12 (YONHAP) -- Deputy Prime Minister 
Chong Chae-sok said on Wednesday [12 January] he would reduce 
the number of rank-1 posts of the Economic Planning Board [EPB] 
by two to six from the existing eight to ensure an increase in 
administration productivity. 
  In a press conference, Chong who concurrently controls the 
board as its minister said the duties of the remaining six 
rank-1 officials will be readjusted after the reduction. 
  "As other offices are expected to ask for increases in their 
authorized manpower when they formulate their 1995 budgets in 
May, it would be difficult to turn their requests down unless 
the EPB scales down its organization first," Chong said. 
  He added that he would effect a reorganization of his board 
on the condition that his board's senior officials endorse it. 
"But, I will wind up the matter sooner or later without dragging 
it on through April," Chong said. 
  The deputy premier also said that the major goal of this 
year's economic operation is to bring about economic 
energization in stability. 
  "We will display our determination to ensure stability by 
pegging price rise down within 6 percent this year," he said.

  [Excerpts]"If you run, you get hurt." A self-preservation 
attitude is eating away at the civil service community. An 
aversion to work is becoming conspicuous among those in civil 
service. At one time able to make even the impossible possible, 
an increasing number of them observe, "Lately, even the possible 
is impossible." This is because they are scared. Even while 
dealing with such burdenless work as the issuance of resident 
registration cards in a comparatively friendly way, they 
hesitate to handle work for which they will be held responsible, 
such as authorizing licenses. It has gone so far that there are 
even people requesting service who offer to pay workers to 
handle their problems. [passage omitted] 
  It has been nine months since the civilian government's 
reforms began. With each sector of society changing at its own 
speed and intensity, the 870,000-strong civil service community 
too seems to have changed in various ways. Overall, it is busier 
and its treatment of even strangers has become comparatively 
friendly. Government workers even answer the phone differently 
than they did in the past. Compared to rural areas, Seoul and 
other urban areas in particular have changed a great deal. 
  One government official compressed the most characteristic 
of 
recent changes into six categories: three that have increased 
and three that have decreased. The so-called "Three Increases, 
Three Decreases". Audits, anonymous messages and group civil 
petitions have increased; the convictions of government workers, 
their supplementary income and desire to work have decreased. 
  The number of audits in particular have increased 
conspicuously. Several audits frequently happen at once, so much 
so that it is said they happen at the drop of a hat. [passage 
omitted] 
  Anonymous messages have also increased markedly. This is so 
much the case that this saying is circulating: "[The government] 
failed at economic revitalization, but succeeded at 
anonymous-message revitalization." Anonymous messages and 
written petitions from all over are pouring into the Blue House, 
Integrated Government Building, Public Service Center, Board of 
Audit and Inspection [BAI] and the Public Prosecutor's Office. 
"Stabbing-the-persimmon-you-can't-eat" style of groundless, 
anonymous messages intended to secretly hurt someone are also 
contributing to this flood. Not too long ago, a saying was 
circulating in one government office in which a bureau chief was 
sacked because of such anonymous messages: "Anonymous messages 
are more frightening than the anti-corruption campaign." 
[passage omitted] 
  Supplementary income has also decreased. The number of 
regularly visiting petitioners has markedly dropped. Contact 
with people who used to occasionally call officials out for food 
and drink has also become rare. The giving and taking of money 
envelopes, considered natural in the past, is now something to 
be done cautiously. Restaurants in the vicinity of government 
offices are starting to feel the pinch of economic hard times. 
[passage omitted] 
  The lack of enthusiasm is the same, regardless of rank or 
duties. Although there may be differences in degree between 
those in and out of government offices, and between central and 
regional offices, their problems are similar. The "season of 
ambition" during which workers were anxious to quickly do 
people's civil-petition paperwork for them appears to have 
passed. Now a new habit is forming in them, a habit of checking 
the regulations carefully one more time to make sure they do not 
get in trouble. 
  Lying low. Is this a byproduct of the reforms or resistance 
to it? 
  "Outwardly making justifications, inwardly asking, what am I 
getting out of it, bureaucrats put class and personal interests 
first. They consider the nation their possession. Their 
existence is of a different order, their consciousness full of 
controlling and interfering. In particular, as a result of their 
distorted political experience, they think taking bribes fair 
and proper and hate the prevention of this most of all." 
  These are the observations of one Seoul National University 
professor. He says bureaucrats by their very nature dislike 
reform. Although not organized, they show a passive resistance 
by not doing what they are told or by doing it slowly, he 
explains. This is a problem at both upper and lower levels, he 
says. 
  "Among office directors, many only answer the phone. They 
have those below them do all the work and do none themselves. 
This is in contrast with the bureaucrats of advanced nations, 
who sit in front of their computers, working diligently of their 
own accord. Because of such directors, administration becomes 
careless. What of those in the lower ranks? Their greatest 
objective is to get in a good position and make a profit for 
themselves. It does no good to tell bureaucrats to reform: all 
they will do is pretend." [passage omitted] 
  One Democratic Party lawmaker was even more critical: "Our 
country's bureaucratic system is a combination of surviving 
feudalistic thought, which puts the government above the people, 
and colonial bureaucracy. To this, add the barracks-style 
authoritarianism picked up during years of military 
dictatorship. Accustomed to this climate, most bureaucrats 
perceive reform to be a loss of their rights, as something 
inconvenient to themselves. Even while accepting--they have no 
other choice--the trend toward democratization and 
decentralization, they criticize it as inefficient every chance 
they get. Unless the scalpel of a large-scale operation is taken 
to the bureaucracy, we cannot hope for reform and 
democratization." 
  Not a few government workers strongly deny this, however. 
[passage omitted] 
  Insisted a secretary of the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and 
Energy [MOTIE] "Far from resisting it, the reform is what we 
want to pull forward." One assistant grade two official working 
in the Capitol Building said the following: 
  "Reform is the current of the times. Even if it weren't 
President Kim, there would have been reform. It may have speeded 
up a little because of him. Although there may be some 
government workers resisting it, they are few. I think most are 
not that way. It is only that they can't move quickly because of 
the nature of the bureaucracy. This actually guarantees the 
government's stability." [passage omitted] 
  Under the name of beautifying the environment, district 
office workers have to go around taking down advertisements off 
the streets. He says they even wash billboards and signs. Even 
worse, if a "civil petition" comes in that a drunk has vomited 
making a public place dirty, they have to go out to clean it, 
the worker says. One told a story about what he experienced 
while removing poster advertisements. 
  "Two of us were engrossed in removing an advertisement from 
a 
telephone pole. One little kid who was going along with his 
mother asked, Mommy, what do those people do?' Do you know what 
the mother answered, then? She said, If you don't study hard 
either, you'll end up being one of those people too.'" 
  He says it is at times like these that the doubt, what is 
the 
use in working hard, enters his mind. Recently, the number of 
public servants feeling this way is increasing. Let us listen to 
the words of one grade five official: 
  "Lately, in meetings between classmates or between juniors 
and seniors, you hear a lot of talk about how empty people feel. 
The greater a person's expectations of the civil service 
community, the greater the sense of emptiness. It's not because 
the profits of the past have disappeared with deregulation. It's 
because there is a great deal of criticism of the economic 
departments to which we have devoted ourselves, as if they were 
an obstacle to our country's economic development and because 
government workers are thought of as a group of criminals. There 
are not a few of my colleagues who feel the present government 
has sold us out for political objectives. It's to the extent 
that we go in twos and threes after work to comfort ourselves in 
the neighborhood bar." 
  The grade five official said, "When there were regulations, 
control was possible, so the work was easy. But as regulations 
were eased, it became less possible to predict, so everything 
must be checked and reviewed. Because of this, there's a lot 
more work to do. There may be those in the front-line windows 
who say they won't take money and they won't work, but here we 
have neither the time nor mental latitude to think like that." 
  Criticized by civil petitioners for saying they "won't take 
money and won't work," there are those who respond, "I have 
something to say to that." These are the words of one low level, 
district office worker: 
  "They say that we're saying, we won't take your money and we 
won't give you an authorization, but is it only the government 
workers who have been bad? It's not that the person in charge is 
finding fault, even though there is nothing wrong. There are 
many cases in which people come with something that cannot be 
done, "include an envelope [a bribe]" and beg you to do it for 
them. They ask you to look the other way; they whine and plead. 
It's giving a break to someone in these pitiable circumstances 
that is considered corruption." [passage omitted] 
  The attitude of government workers toward civil-petitioners 
is very negative. The words of one district office employee: 
  "Petitioners think if they only include a money envelope in 
their paperwork, then it will all go through. If you tell them 
to supplement this or that point, they just think they didn't 
put enough money in the envelope. If even then you don't take 
their money and demand supplementary measures, they apply 
pressure through higher-ups or send anonymous messages for 
totally unrelated reasons." 
  Of those around him, "Many have suffered this," he says, 
"unless the whole of society changes, there will be government 
worker corruption." "If petitioners don't get their way, they 
send anonymous messages," says a worker at another district 
office. [passage omitted] 
  The audits have played a big part in workers' decisions to 
"work according to the law." "You have to spend two weeks 
getting ready for one audit. There are a lot of cases in which 
people can't do other work because of this," said one junior 
official who works in a district office housing department, "You 
hesitate to issue a license because you don't know what 
indications are going to come out of the audit." Having watched 
inspections of workers below him several times, one municipal 
office manager takes a much stronger tone in his criticism of 
the auditing: 
  "Do you think the BAI [Board of Audit and Inspection] people 
are all clean? Some of them are robbers. In the past, they dealt 
with all high-level civil petitions. Our country can't work 
because of the BAI. Hardworking people all get hurt. They are 
the only ones who like inspections." 
  "There is a lot of disparity between service administration 
and inspections," says one district-office manager, until 
recently working in the Seoul municipal office. Contrary to 
service administration, which actively interprets legal 
statutes, standing on the side of civil petitioners, auditors 
end up interpreting the nature of the statutes in a passive way. 
"Unless they narrow this deviation in interpretation, service 
administration will become impossible," he said, "We are stuck 
with the absurdity of being disciplined more the harder we 
work." Is it not this absurdity which created the 
self-preservation attitude of the civil service community? 
  To the question, "What within your organization has changed 
with the reforms?" most government workers answer, "Nothing." 
There are many who respond, "It's become friendlier," "It's 
become cleaner" or "We try hard to do right." The observation 
that the reform is deepening is attributable to this. [passage 
omitted] 
  Although nine months have passed since the reform began, it 
is not progressing as it should. Concerning areas in which there 
were many irregularities and injustices in the past, only 
auditing is being done. No deep prescriptions for eliminating 
the causes of these irregularities are seen. [passage omitted] 
  "When the Blue House says `reform,' ministers and vice 
ministers hear this, come and gather the bureau chiefs together 
and say `reform.' The bureau chiefs gather those below them and 
talk of reform; those below them also repeat this talk of reform 
to the people below them. But they only said to carry out 
reform. Nobody knows what it is that we are supposed to reform. 
The same goes for the ministers who came in as a reform force. 
The minister has to designate something to reform, but to do 
this, he has to know the work of his ministry well. How many 
such persons are there among the present ministers?" 
  "It doesn't matter whether they are ministers, vice 
ministers 
or senior officials, they can't carry out reform because they 
don't know anything," asserts a person with the rank of bureau 
chief working at the Capitol Building. The Blue House is also 
within range of his criticism. 
  "The Blue House has been telling us to carry out reform, but 
not saying what to reform. All it does is repeat the vague 
slogan, Creating a New Korea. But it apparently has no concrete 
methodology on what and how to reform. It's just saying that 
government workers aren't moving, without presenting any 
particulars." [passage omitted] 
  A Blue House source says, "The civil service community has 
no 
choice but to be placed in a contradictory relationship: on the 
one hand, it suffers because of the anti-corruption drive, on 
the other hand, it must draft policy and implement the reform. 
Even for this, it cannot depend on the Blue House for 
particulars, but must find them itself. The direction of the 
anti-corruption drive concerning the government-service 
community is not against past offenders, but against those 
people who do not intend to change." 
  Is this really the direction the anti-corruption against 
public servants has taken up to now? Unfortunately, it does not 
appear so. The personal assets registration of public servants 
is a representative example of this. There were senior officials 
who in the morning heard from their minister, "Stay just as you 
are," only to hear, "At the Blue House, they say it doesn't look 
good," in the afternoon and then have to resign. There was also 
a figure of the legal profession who had to resign only because 
the land he bought with money he had received as an inheritance 
happened to be in Suji-myon, Yongin county. 
  The economic condition of a ministry became the standard of 
the anti-corruption drive. Too much interest in finances became 
a cause of misfortune. "Is it 500 million or a billion [won]?" 
became the line between the guilty and the innocent. People had 
to be anxious over whether they had left out their sons' 
accounts when registering personal assets. This has been one 
aspect of the anti-corruption drive up to now. The reality of 
the civil service community was that, during the time its 
members were supposed to be finding their own work, such as 
drafting policy for the particulars of the reform, they had no 
choice but to look after their futures and the concerns of those 
above them. 
  There will be many changes in the position held by the Blue 
House until now, predicted one senior Blue House official in 
connection with the anti-corruption drive in the civil service 
community. "It is true that until now we have mainly treated the 
problem's symptoms. In the future, however, we intend not to use 
these measures as far as possible. The symptoms suffered by the 
civil service community are so severe that by trying to excise 
some parts we could end up killing the patient. Its reform 
cannot help but be time-consuming." This shows us the 
considerable extent of the Blue House's distrust of the civil 
service. 
  Late last October, a conference of 
planning-management-office 
directors from each department of the Capitol Building was held 
for the first time in a long time. It was set up to discuss the 
problem of education for government workers, but in the middle 
of the meeting, it unexpectedly went off in a curious direction. 
The Blue House's method of reforming the government-service 
community came up in conversation. The words of one participant: 
  "Government employees feel their work is worthwhile because 
of four things: honor, promotion, remuneration and job security. 
That the recent reform wind stole all these away from them came 
up in conversation. Far from being honorable, the public servant 
is presently portrayed as a member of some criminal 
organization, resulting in this loss. Prospects are that the 
backlog in promotions will grow more severe as the years go by 
and, on top of this, pay is poor. It's bad enough as it is, but 
the cold wave of the anti-corruption campaign reduced both legal 
and illegal income by 30 percent. Job security for government 
workers is never knowing when your head is going to roll." 
  "For these reasons, government workers have become cynical," 
he said, "In order to cause a desire to participate in the 
reform to truly well up from within, we need to raise their 
morale. Since everything else is working out well, we concluded 
that each of us through our ministers should suggest to the Blue 
House that, at least, it often give official recognition to 
people who do well." [passage omitted] 
  The promotion backlog is now considerably severe. It takes 
an 
average of 12.7 years to be promoted from grade five to grade 
four and 10.4 years from grade four to grade three. In the 
finance ministry and Economic Planning Board, this still takes 
2-3 years more than other ministries. Prospects are that these 
periods will lengthen as time goes by. [passage omitted] 
  To relieve its severe promotion backlog, beginning last 
November the Ministry of Government Administration adopted a 
plural ranking system for the main chief clerk positions in its 
central departments. Through this, about 269 people were 
promoted to grade four, even while doing grade five work. The 
question is how long the effects of this will continue. 
  The promotion backlog is the same at the lower levels. 
Although there are some who started at grade nine and are now 
bureau chiefs in central departments, people in the lower ranks 
cannot even dream of this. At best, 18 years are required to go 
from grade nine assistant clerk to grade six junior official. 
Furthermore, in the future there is a high probability that the 
best one can hope for will be to retire as a junior official. 
With the best they can aim for being "eternal low rank," there 
is concern about whether talented people will come into 
government service at all. 
  Because of this promotion backlog, dissatisfaction is being 
concentrated on the problem of remuneration. They are asking to 
at least be given decent pay. The present pay of government 
workers is reportedly 87 percent of workers at government-run 
firms. During his campaign, President Kim promised to raise this 
to 100 percent within his term in office. There are no 
government workers who actually believe this, however. This is 
because every president has made the same campaign promise. 
There is a great deal of criticism over the freeze on government 
pay early this year. "Just because he's president, does that 
mean he can change what was put into the budget by last year's 
National Assembly?" ask some, saying that with the wage freeze 
the president went beyond his authority. 
  One MOTIE grade five official with 11 years in grade, said, 
"I take home about W1 million in months without a bonus and 1.7 
million in months with a bonus. I was shocked when I compared my 
salary to that of a man in his tenth year working for Samsung: I 
made over W600,000 less in the amount actually received." 
[passage omitted] 
  There are problems with the present pay system, which 
decides 
pay based on rank and number of years worked. Rather than 
increases in pay, it is geared more toward increases in rank, so 
all must depend on promotion. Some point to this as a stumbling 
block in the way of the move toward a specialized 
administration. Also, if the small government is achieved, the 
bureaucracy may have less appeal than previously. In preparation 
for this, pay needs to be raised more quickly, to continually 
entice a capable elite into the government. In an economic 
department of the Kwachon government building early this year, 
there was a disturbance when an elite, grade four official said 
he was going to the private sector and others tried to dissuade 
him. 
  It is very obvious that if the morale of the bureaucracy 
drops, it is difficult for the government to be managed as it 
should. Promotion and pay are not the only factors raising 
morale. Continuous encouragement is needed capable of awakening 
a sense of belonging and duty. One senior official used the 
chariot-race scene in the movie Ben Hur as an 
example. Ben Hur beat off innumerable competitors to win; there 
is a direct correlation between this and his handling of the 
reins, he says. If one looks closely, one can see that the 
others are whipping their horses, but, without a whip, he only 
keeps the horses in order using the reins, he points out. 
  It has been the whip of the anti-corruption drive centered 
around the Blue House which has characterized the YS [Kim 
Yong-sam] style of reform. Thus, people are heard to say things 
like, "The direction is different, but the method is the same as 
that of past authoritarian regimes," and use the newly-coined 
word, Taechi [presidential rule]. The underlying tone of the 
reform of the government-service community was also determined 
by this Blue House-centered, anti-corruption style. Because of 
this, the civil service community is frozen with fear and 
self-preservation attitudes are prevalent. A bureaucratic 
organization cannot be the faithful instrument of a reformist 
government. Unless the situation is changed, the reform may fail 
and fade away. But this does not mean that it is okay for civil 
service reform to stop. Reform must continue, but it must be 
done with the attitude of Ben Hur driving his chariot.

  [Text] The fifth round of Japan-U.S. economic talks on 
insurance will begin in Washington on 10 January. Japan and the 
United States are scheduled to bring a conclusion to this issue 
by the time that the Japan-U.S. summit talks are held on 11 
February. However, Japan-U.S. talks on this issue are still at 
odds. As it has done for other commercial sectors, the United 
States has been calling on Japan to establish a "numerical 
target" for opening up Japan's insurance market despite the 
Japanese Government's rejection of this. In addition, the U.S. 
Government has also called on Japan to delay its liberalization 
of some areas of Japan's insurance markets. In response, Japan 
has reacted strongly against the U.S. Government's call, 
stressing that the U.S. Government's call runs counter to the 
principle of talks that emphasize the "promotion of market 
opening." Therefore, such resistance by Japan has further 
increased the uncertainty of the future of the talks. 
  Since the first talks in Hawaii in September 1993, 
Japan-U.S. 
negotiations on insurance have been held once a month. 
Originally, Japan and the United States were scheduled to reach 
certain agreements in the upcoming talks. However, "in the past 
negotiations, both the Japanese and the U.S. delegates have just 
repeatedly stressed their own positions, and thus no concrete 
progress has been made so far in the talks" (according to a 
Finance Ministry source). For that reason, it seems that 
working-level meetings will be held sometime this month. 
  A Japanese official involved in the negotiations has said 
that it is still questionable why high priority is given to the 
negotiations on insurance together with government procurement 
and auto and auto parts among the nearly 20 sector-by-sector 
negotiations. A prevailing view is that, because it had been 
said that a draft bill on revising the law concerning the 
insurance sector would be submitted to the Diet as early as 
January 1994 by the Insurance Council, the United States tried 
to reflect its demands in the bill. However, the U.S. hopes have 
not been met so far because the council is falling behind in its 
work on drafting the bill. 
  Underlying the delay in the negotiations on insurance is 
Japan's strong opposition to the U.S. calls for allowing foreign 
insurance companies to join an organization composed of Japanese 
insurance companies and delaying the liberalization of the 
Japanese insurance market in the areas where foreign-capital 
insurance companies occupy a dominant position. 
  As one of its requests, the United States has called for 
freezing the liberalization of the so-called "third sector" of 
the insurance market -- which is coverage for casualty, disease, 
and nursing losses. 
  In the third sector of the insurance market, foreign 
insurers, including U.S. insurers, account for a greater market 
share. But a report submitted by the Insurance Council in 1992 
calls for allowing life insurers access the nonlife insurance 
market and nonlife insurers to make inroads into the life 
insurance market. 
  Taking into consideration foreign insurance companies, the 
report also calls for liberalizing by stages the third sector of 
the insurance market. The United States, however, has called 
for freezing for about five years the liberalization of the 
third sector. 
  The United States insists that, "because Japan's insurance 
market is closed to foreign firms, basic types of insurance such 
as fire insurance and auto insurance should be liberalized 
first. In this sense, it is not reasonable to single out the 
issue of liberalizing the third sector of the market." However, 
Japan intends to not change its stand of opposing the U.S. calls 
by saying that the United State's calls to shelve the 
liberalization of the third sector while calling for opening 
other areas of the market is an "opportunistic attitude." 
  Of course, work on reviewing Japan's insurance system has 
been under way based on the requests of the United States. 
Currently, foreign-capital insurers are not allowed to obtain 
membership in the Marine and Fire Insurance Association of 
Japan, Inc. [MFIA], but the MFIA is working on revising its 
articles of association with the aim of permitting them to join 
the MFIA. Moreover, the Housing Loan Corporation, in paying 
attention to foreign-capital insurers, took measures last fall 
to give foreign-capital firms more chances to win fire insurance 
contracts.

  [Text] U.S. officials have criticized Japanese bureaucrats 
for standing in the way of agreements in the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks. Commenting on this criticism at a news 
conference following an 11 January cabinet session, Minister of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI] Hiroshi Kumagai--who is 
renowned for "sacking a bigwig bureau chief"--refuted the 
criticism and defended Japanese bureaucrats, saying: 
"Bureaucrats and politicians share the same judgment." 
  The United States has been escalating its criticism of 
Japanese bureaucrats. In December last year, Bowman Cutter, 
special assistant to President Clinton for economic policy, 
said: "Japanese bureaucrats have a tendency to give more 
priority to the interests of their respective ministries than to 
the prime minister's intentions." U.S. Commerce Under Secretary 
Garten, who is in charge of handling the automobile and auto 
parts issue, has been shunning contacts with bureaucrats and 
increasing contacts with other people since he arrived in Japan. 
  The U.S. criticism against Japanese bureaucrats aims to win 
public support in Japan by shifting its spearhead to the 
bureaucrats instead of the Hosokawa cabinet which enjoys a high 
public approval rating, and to keep bureaucratic resistance to 
the cabinet in check. The relationship between politicians and 
bureaucrats has changed delicately since the coalition 
government was inaugurated and the resignation of former MITI 
Industrial Policy Bureau chief Masahisa Naito drew attention in 
the United States as a symbol of that change. 
  MITI Minister Kumagai criticized the bureaucrats shortly 
after taking office, saying, "The Japanese market is a lump of 
established interests. Government officials are unaware of this 
because they work at their desks." At the 11 January news 
conference, however, he defended the bureaucrats, saying, "MITI 
officials are working hard. They are not closeting themselves in 
the logic of government office." Stressing the need for the 
"unity of politicians and bureaucrats," he clarified his 
attitude that he will not yield to U.S. trade demands. It is 
believed that, mindful of smoldering distrust of him among MITI 
officials following the fuss over Naito's resignation, he made 
the comments in a bid to "mend fences" with them.

  [Text] On 11 January, Joan E. Spero, U.S. under secretary 
of state for economic and agricultural affairs, speaking on the 
Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, said: "There are priority 
areas such as government procurement, automobiles, and auto 
parts. After enactment of the political reform bills, we would 
like the Japanese Government to shift its attention and work on 
these priorities." She made the request during a meeting with 
Yukio Hatoyama, deputy chief cabinet secretary, at the prime 
minister's official residence on the same day. 
  In response, Hatoyama, while maintaining that setting 
numerical targets is unacceptable, said: "I feel that it is 
possible for Japan and the United States to hold talks to work 
out something that is acceptable to both sides."

  [Text] On 11 January, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata 
rejected U.S. demands in the framework trade talks that Japan 
try to increase the share of foreign products and foreign firms 
in its domestic market to the level of that in other major 
industrialized (G-7) nations. At a news conference following a 
regular cabinet meeting the same day, Hata said: "It is 
senseless to say that it is unfair that certain products are not 
selling well in a certain country although they are selling well 
in other countries. It is not proper to look at one figure and 
insist that things ought to be a certain way."

  [Text] In connection with the issue of expanding market 
access for U.S.-made cellular phones, the U.S. Government has 
asked the Japanese Government to "guide" the Japan Mobile 
Communications Company (JMCC) to build more ground stations for 
U.S.-made cellular phones. The request has been made by 
Charlene Barshevsky, deputy U.S. trade representative, to 
Masahito Tani, deputy minister of the Posts and 
Telecommunications Ministry. "The United States is said to have 
not indicated the specific number of ground stations for the 
U.S.-made cellular phones" (says a source at the ministry), but 
there is a possibility that the United Stats will ask Japan to 
set numerical targets in the future. The Japanese Government is 
refusing the request, saying, "This is not an issue to be 
handled between the governments of the two countries but rather 
is one to be handled between the private sector companies of the 
two countries." 
  The issue has existed since last December when the U.S. 
Trade 
Representative launched an investigation last December, claiming 
that "there is a possibility that Japan has not complied with an 
agreement on cellular phones which was concluded between Japan 
and the United States in December 1989" and dropping hints about 
sanctions against Japan in accordance with the Omnibus Trade 
Act. The results of the investigation will be released on 15 
February. 
  The main point of the Japan-U.S. agreement on cellular 
phones 
is that Japan will permit Motorola-style cellular phones to 
operate in the Tokyo area and in Japan's centers of population 
by allotting new frequencies to the phones. In complying with 
the agreement, the JMCC has begun a Motorola-style cellular 
phone service in addition to the conventional-style cellular 
phone service provided by the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone 
Corporation (NTT). 
  The Motorola-style cellular phone service covers smaller 
areas than the NTT-style cellular phone service because of the 
difference in the number of ground stations for the two cellular 
phone services. For this reason, about 300,000 cars subscribe 
to the NTT-style cellular phone service, whereas about 10,000 
cars subscribe to the Motorola-style cellular phone service. 
This unequal arrangement has triggered complaints by the United 
States. 
  According to the JMCC, the number of ground stations for the 
Motorola-style cellular phone service will be increased to 190 
by April, but this figure is less than half of 430 ground 
stations serving the NTT-style cellular phone service. The JMCC 
has announced plans to increase the number of ground stations 
for the Motorola-style cellular phone service after April by 100 
over the next two years. According to the Posts and 
Telecommunications Ministry, the U.S. Government has yet to 
express its satisfaction with the figure. Motorola said, "At 
the moment, we decline to make any comment, but we intend to 
observe how the governments of the two countries will negotiate 
on the issue."

  [Text] On 11 January, a senior official at the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI] referred to a plan to 
increase to $19 billion in fiscal year 1994 the amount of U.S. 
auto parts procured by Japanese automakers and said, "It would 
be difficult to carry out the plan." In bilateral framework 
trade talks on autos and auto parts, Washington has called on 
Tokyo to ask Japanese automakers to formulate programs for 
imports of U.S. auto parts beyond fiscal year 1995 so they that 
these can be used as "objective criteria" to gauge the openness 
of the Japanese market. Thus, the negative view expressed by the 
MITI official might affect the unofficial vice-ministerial-level 
talks on autos and the auto parts trade that are to start on 12 
January. 
  In January 1992, when former U.S. President George Bush 
visited Tokyo, Japanese automakers drew up programs for their 
procurement of U.S. auto parts under MITI's guidance. They 
imported or procured locally U.S.-made parts worth $7.24 billion 
in the first half of fiscal year 1993 (April-September 1993), a 
21.1-percent increase from the previous year. Despite this 
large increase, the senior MITI official thinks that "their 
procurement will decrease from now on," noting that the 
emergence of new models developed by the U.S. Big Three is 
casting a shadow over the sales of Japanese cars in the U.S. 
market, and that the ratio of parts procured locally by Japanese 
factories in the United States has already been very high, thus 
making it difficult for them to purchase more. 
  He believes that expanding the import of U.S.-made parts 
"will be more difficult than increasing local procurement" 
because car sales remain sluggish at home and Japanese 
automakers can no longer afford to buy expensive U.S. parts. 
  MITI has concluded that it is highly unlikely that the 
amount 
of U.S. parts procured by Japanese automakers, which is expected 
to reach about $15 billion altogether in fiscal year 1993, will 
increase appreciably in fiscal year 1994. 
  The Japanese Government is avoiding getting involved in the 
U.S.-made parts procurement plans, claiming: "What is 
demonstrated in the procurement programs are voluntary goals set 
by Japanese automakers on the condition that their production in 
the United States should increase by 50 percent." However, the 
U.S. Government views the procurement programs as Japan's 
"commitments" and considers them a good example of numerical 
targets. It is possible that MITI's negative view on the 
expansion of U.S.-made parts procurement will cause Washington's 
attitude to toughen in the auto and auto parts trade talks.

SHIMBUN in Japanese 13 January Morning Edition] 
  [Text] U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has said 
that the possibility of restoring the Super 301 provision of the 
1988 Omnibus Trade Act through a presidential decree is under 
consideration. He is believed to have made the remark to shake 
up the Japanese Government, which continues to take a hard-line 
attitude toward the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. 
  It is highly possible that the United States will restore 
the 
Super 301 provision through presidential decree if the 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks end in failure, but the 
United States is not necessarily confident it will have the 
desired effect. 
  A bill on restoration of the Super 301 provision is expected 
to be introduced to Congress in late January, when its recess 
ends, and it is widely believed the bill will be supported by 
Congress. 
  The U.S. Government has explored ways to restore the 
provision through presidential decree since last year, before 
Congress moved to enact the bill. It began to look at how to 
restore the provision in December when Japan and the United 
States were locked in confrontation over the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks and the multilateral trade negotiations [the 
Uruguay Round of GATT] reached their conclusion without some 
U.S. complaints having been addressed. 
  But the Japanese do not expect restoration of the provision 
to have the desired effect. A source traveling with the 
Japanese delegation said, "there is no need for Japan to be 
furious at all." If the United States restores this one-sided 
sanction so soon after conclusion of the Uruguay Round, it would 
lead European and Asian nations to criticize the United States. 
The U.S. Government must, therefore, be cautious about invoking 
the provision. 
  It could create a situation in which Japan and the United 
States come to a showdown on the eve of the scheduled Japan-U.S. 
summit talks in February. How will Prime Minister Hosokawa and 
ministers of the coalition government respond to the issue? If 
government leaders rush to instruct Japanese negotiators to make 
absurd concessions at the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, 
the United States will get what it wants. It goes without 
saying that whatever the U.S. attitude, the Japanese Government 
needs to decide on concrete measures on its own to fulfill the 
prime minister's public pledge to expand Japanese domestic 
demand and cut its current account surplus by opening the 
Japanese market.

  [Text] Sources well versed in Japan-DPRK relations 
disclosed on 11 January that the North Korean leadership had 
rapidly developed a bad impression of Japan since the 
inauguration of the Hosokawa government. They said the 
resumption of negotiations between Japan and the DPRK on 
normalizing diplomatic relations, which have been suspended 
since November 1992, "is unlikely unless relations improve 
greatly." The sources said Pyongyang sees Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party], a main force within the Hosokawa coalition 
government, as "a lackey of the United States" and it is unhappy 
with the alliance between Shinseito and the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ], which once had friendly relations with 
the Workers Party of Korea [WPK]. These are the reasons for 
DPRK's bad impression of Japan, the sources said. 
  Representatives of the General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) did not attend the SDPJ national 
convention and this seems to be the reflection of the opinion of 
the North Korean leadership. The SDPJ and Shinseito paved the 
way for normalization talks after Shin Kanemaru, (then) vice 
president of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], visited 
Pyongyang in the autumn of 1990. They were believed to have 
formed close relations with the DPRK. Therefore, a Foreign 
Ministry source said: "We have not expected that the DPRK has 
such a bad impression of Japan." 
  The sources met with Hwang Chang-ye [name as published] and 
other North Korean senior officials in charge of diplomacy since 
the Supreme People's Assembly renewed the North Korean 
leadership last month. The sources said the North Korean 
leadership considers "relations with Japan below zero, compared 
to the U.S.-DPRK and North-South talks." 
  The sources quoted a North Korean leader as saying: "The 
Hosokawa government is worse than the LDP government. The SDPJ 
has failed to establish its independece within the coalition 
government and it can no longer be considered friendly to the 
WPK. The SDPJ has joined hands with (Shinseito Chief Secretary 
Ichiro) Ozawa. Ozawa and (former Defense Agency Director General 
Keisuke) Nakanishi are puppets of the United States dressed in 
the clothes of the United Nations." They also quoted another 
North Korean leader as saying: "Pyongyang expects nothing from 
Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. We do not think he 
can do something in defiance of Ozawa's will." 
  The sources indicated that prospects for resuming 
normalization talks are dim and that it would be difficult to 
carry out a plan of promoting bilateral exchanges at a political 
party level.

  [Text] Beijing, 9 Jan -- Plans will be worked out for 
scheduling Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to China on 
20- 21 March, according to a source accompanying Tsutomu Hata, 
deputy prime minister and concurrently foreign minister, in the 
latter's Chinese visit. The source made this disclosure on 9 
January. Concerning Prime Minister Hosokawa's visit to China, 
Hata and Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart, had earlier 
agreed at their 8 January meeting in Beijing on working out 
plans for Hosokawa's visit at an early date. 
  In the backdrop of the prime minister's making firm his 
intention to visit China as early as March is the fact that 
although he has visited the United States and the ROK since his 
inauguration, he still has not visited China, which, along with 
the United States, is a focal point of Japanese diplomacy. 
Furthermore, Prime Minister Hosokawa plans to work out details 
regarding the total value of the planned yen loan to China -- 
the fourth such loan program -- which Foreign Minister Hata put 
on the rails during his visit there. 
  Regarding the schedule of Hosokawa's visit, Chinese 
officials 
have requested a 3-day visit starting 19 January. Japanese 
officials, however, are working primarily around a plan for a 
visit on 20-21 March, taking advantage of consecutive holidays. 
This plan also takes into consideration the schedule of Diet 
sessions, among other matters.

  [Text] Prime Minister Hosokawa has announced plans to move 
up the review of the "Guideline for the Defense Buildup Plan" 
one year and to reflect the review's results in the 1995 budget. 
In response, the Defense Agency [DA] is now examining the 
possibility of ending the Midterm Defense Buildup Plan (1991 to 
1995) in 1994. No decision, however, has been made about how to 
proceed with the review in the future because a coordination of 
views has yet to be carried out between the DA and the prime 
minister on the review, and DA is at a loss over how to deal 
with the review. 
  Prime Minister Hosokawa intends to inaugurate his private 
advisory body this spring with the mandate to study a new 
defense guideline to replace the current guideline and to come 
up with conclusions on the new defense guideline. The DA will 
start working on the new guideline after this summer in line 
with the conclusion. Because the current Midterm Defense Buildup 
Plan is designed to formulate the guideline, "The DA considers 
it natural to launch a new midterm defense buildup plan in 1995 
after ending the current Midterm Defense Buildup Plan in 1994" 
to reflect the new guideline in the 1995 budget (says a DA 
source). 
  It will be hard for the DA to get the cabinet to decide on 
the new guideline and the new midterm defense buildup plan 
during 1994 because of procedural difficulties and a heavy 
workload. As a last resort, the idea is surfacing that the new 
midterm defense buildup plan should be launched in 1996 as 
scheduled. 
  Nonetheless, the prime minister has yet to give the DA 
clear-cut instructions, including on the way to handle the new 
midterm defense buildup plan, and this appears to be heightening 
the irritation in the DA. DA Administrative Vice Minister 
Shigeru Hatakeyama told a news conference on 10 January that 
"(the prime minister's remarks) are his personal opinion, and 
his remarks cannot be considered to be his instructions."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Deepening Rift Between the Prime </F>
Minister and the Finance Ministry"] 
  [Text] The honeymoon that has lasted between the Prime 
Minister's Office and the Finance Ministry since the Hosokawa 
government was inaugurated last August is coming to an end, and 
now a deep rift is occurring between them. The power of the 
Finance Ministry within the Hosokawa government has grown so 
strong that the prime minister is now unable to control it. 
There are growing complaints from people around the prime 
minister who say "The Finance Ministry should be brought under 
control, by force if necessary," but it is also true that the 
prime minister cannot do much in the economic realm, such as 
stimulating the economy, without the cooperation of the Finance 
Ministry. The prime minister is growing increasingly irritated 
by this dilemma. 
  The prime minister recently expressed his strong discontent 
with the Finance Ministry to one of his acquaintances, saying: 
"They do not bring us any ideas. Nor they want to listen to 
what we tell them." The recent problem arises from the Finance 
Ministry's persistence in combining in a package the issues of 
reducing income taxes and raising the consumption tax. 
  The prime minister does not support taking care of these 
issues together in view of the condition of the ruling coalition 
parties, wherein the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is 
opposed to the idea of raising the consumption tax. He thinks 
that the government should implement the income tax cut first 
and put off acting on a consumption tax increase until later. 
His office has asked the Finance Ministry repeatedly to come up 
with a plan that supports this line of thinking. For a while, 
the Prime Minister's Office suggested as a compromise "making a 
promise to carry out a cut in the consumption tax in the future 
but proposing to make perishable foods tax-free and to impose 
high tax rates on table luxuries to enable the SDPJ to accept 
the consumption tax increase." But the Finance Ministry is said 
to have rejected this suggestion and instead to have insisted 
that "such a tax cannot be called a consumption tax, and that is 
tantamount to restoring the commodity taxes." 
  The reason why the Finance Ministry is so persistent about 
raising the consumption tax [while at the same time reducing 
income taxes] is not only because of the financial authorities' 
basic stand in quest of "balanced finance," but also because of 
the support for such stand by people like Ichiro Ozawa, general 
secretary of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. On the other 
hand, the prime minister himself has so far kept on saying, "We 
cannot pump out deficit-covering bonds." He now simply cannot 
declare that he has decided to go ahead with the income tax cuts. 
  Even the meeting of the Government-Ruling Parties Economic 
Issue Consultative Council, which the prime minister had hoped 
would play the role of an intermediary on the matter, broke up 
on 6 January, after the ruling parties revolted, saying: "When 
there is only one answer (that the consumption tax increase 
should be handled as a separate matter), the Finance Ministry 
persists on handling the two issues together. As long as that 
is the given condition, there is no use in continuing the 
talks." As a result, it has become very likely that the prime 
minister will not be able to make an announcement on economic 
stimulus measures in mid-January as he has publicly pledged he 
will do. 
  For the prime minister, if that happens, this setback will 
come on the heels of the one concerning his failure to formulate 
the 1994 budget before the end of 1993. As such, there are 
emerging voices among those around the prime minister which say, 
"We should emulate Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international 
trade and industry, and the Prime Minister's Office should show 
its leadership even if takes the tough step of firing some 
senior officials if necessary." 
  But if the relationship between the Prime Minister's Office 
and the Finance Ministry deteriorates further, there can be 
problems in adopting emergency economic stimulus measures and in 
formulating the third 1993 supplementary budget and the regular 
1994 budget. As for the question of how to handle the Finance 
Ministry, it may be said that the prime minister is now having 
his ability called into question.

University: "No Way Out Yet Seen for Heisei Recession"] 
  [Text] Frankly, forecasts for the Japanese economy for 
1994 are not bright in the least. Compared to the previous 
year, a 2-percent decrease is still seen in placement of orders 
for machinery and for construction, which are indicators of 
future capital investment, and there is no sign of recovery in 
consumption. After all, the Heisei recession has lingered on for 
almost three years, and there are not yet signs of its end. On 
top of this, prospects for future employment are seriously 
deteriorating. 
  In the past, the Showa depression [1920's] and the Great 
Depression of the United States were triggered by ruptures of 
giant bubbles in the economies of Japan and the United States. 
In both cases, several years were required to emerge from the 
effects of the ruptures. In the Great Depression, for example, 
the U.S. economy reached its worst condition in the fourth year 
following the big crash in stock prices. The slump started in 
1929, with stock prices plunging to one-eighth of their original 
value by 1933. The real gross national product was one-half of 
that of 1929, and the unemployment rate reached 25 percent. 
Capital investment fell from $40.4 billion in 1929 to $5.3 
billion in 1933. The economic growth rate finally became 
positive in 1934, the fifth year following the rupture. 
  The Heisei recession need not follow the same path as the 
U.S. Great Depression did, which would be a great calamity. But 
it bears many resemblances to the U.S. case in such phenomena as 
the following: financial institutions are confronting a large 
number of bad loans; transactions involving assets have greatly 
diminished; capital investment has been very low for a long 
time; and so on. Taking these factors into consideration, to our 
regret, the Japanese economy may yet face its worst period, but 
it is hoped that a light at the end of the tunnel may be found 
in 1995. 
  One bright prospect is that the foreign economic situation, 
led by the United States, is on the way to recovery. The U.S. 
growth rate is expected to rise to 4 percent in 1994. Its 
high-technology industries centering on automobiles and 
computers have regained confidence and its volume of capital 
investment has increased. In Europe, too, light has at last 
begun to shine. The United Kingdom has recovered, and Germany 
has apparently reached a state of recovery, though hovering at a 
low level. No doubt recoveries in foreign economies will 
favorably affect the Japanese economy. 
  Another bright factor is related to the exchange rate. 
Japanese export-oriented industries cannot make both ends meet 
with the exchange rate at a level of 100 yen to the dollar. As 
a result, the quantity of exports has rapidly decreased. Thus, 
the current account balance of payments surplus began to shrink, 
in terms of both the yen and the dollar. The exchange rate 
responded favorably to this, and began to move toward 
depreciation of the yen. The rapid U.S. business recovery may 
possibly serve to slow down moves toward curtailing the trade 
imbalance. In addition, disparities between foreign and 
domestic interest rates are beginning to widen, which is another 
factor helping to create a strong dollar and a weak yen. 
  The yen appreciation shock following the Plaza Accord was 
absorbed comparatively easily by greatly expanded domestic 
demand created immediately after the agreement. But the current 
strength of the yen came in the midst of a sluggish economic 
situation, and rational investments in automobile and 
electronics industries alone cannot mitigate the shock. If the 
yen rate returns to the level of 120 yen per dollar, 
export-oriented industries may yet fare very well. 
  Irrespective of these encouraging factors, the fact that 
1994 
will be a severe year for the Japanese economy must be faced. 
When the fact that employment statistics are lagging indicators 
of economic realities is taken into consideration, it may easily 
be predicted that the unemployment rate will reach 3 percent. 
  Therefore, it is necessary to implement structural economic 
reform based on a long-range view, in addition to taking 
short-term emergency economic measures. In order to prevent the 
current economic condition from deteriorating further, it is 
urgently required to put in force daring pump-priming measures 
to revitalize business conditions. In that case, an 
aggregate-demand policy such as simply reducing income taxes 
will not suffice. The effects of the rupture of the bubble 
economy linger on as burdens on the Japanese economy, and 
policies are needed to eradicate them. Such capital market 
activation measures as expediting depreciation of bad loans, tax 
reforms to solicit active land transaction and utilization, land 
procurement by public funds, and so on are inevitable. 
  After carrying out these short-term measures to the fullest 
extent possible, a bold restructuring with the 21st century in 
mind should be enforced in a daring manner. Tax reform, with 
adjustments in the ratio of direct and indirect taxes as the 
major element, should come first, followed by liberalization of 
controls and regulations. As for deregulation, the Hiraiwa 
report [by the Economic Reform Research Council] calls for 
"abolition of economic controls and regulations in principle" 
and a total review of all regulations within five years. This 
is an epoch-making proposal for Japan, which is bound by 
controls and regulations, and will depend for its success on 
actual implementation. 
  In addition, a sweeping expansion of social capital is 
necessary with the 21st century close at hand. So far, public 
investment has been lamentably insufficient to meet the the 
great needs of an aging society, as well as needs for skills and 
information. The current basic plan for public investment has 
to be reviewed in its entirety so that budget appropriations may 
be adjusted to meet the needs of the times, and at least 1 
trillion yen must be reserved and accumulated additionally for 
this purpose. In order to ensure further development, it is 
inevitable for Japan to actively build up social capital 
required for its future. This must be done within the next 15 
years, in which time Japan will still be able to reserve funds 
before the aging of its society begins in earnest. 
  Economic reform is an inevitable task for Japan, which must 
create an economic society of greater creativity and more 
vitality. I hope that the Heisei recession will be used as an 
opportunity to carry out that structural reform.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Atsushi Mamiya: "Corrupt Construction </F>
Structure--Second Shot at Belated Reform of Bidding System; But 
Bid-Rigging Has Not Disappeared"] 
  [Text] A review of the bidding system has hastily 
begun as bribery by one general contractor after another has 
been exposed. It is the designated bidding system that is 
considered the root of many evils. Will dango [bid-rigging by 
collusion] really be made to disappear? Only system theories are 
being advanced without a view to controlling economic crime. 
  "The element that includes the opinions of those making the 
designations is strong in designated bidding. It is necessary 
first to push for fairness all around, not whether this is a 
proper method (as a method for ordering public works 
construction)" (Mitsugi Madokoro, deputy mayor, Sendai). 
  A public announcement for construction bids for four public 
works proejcts was made on 2 September in Sendai, where former 
Mayor Toru Ishii was arrested and indicted on charges of 
accepting bribes as the beginning of a series of general 
contractor bribes. The bidding system is the first "restricted 
general competitive bidding" in the city. It was hastily 
introduced as the focus of measures to prevent impropriety. 
  However, they have balked at applying it from the very 
start. 
A total of 140 companies applied for the four projects. The 99 
companies that passed the qualifications screening of seven 
items such as operations record and examination of business 
particulars, were present at the bidding on the 15th. In the 
previous designated bidding in Sendai, four to 12 companies were 
designated as bidders for one construction project. With the 
sudden increase in companies applying to bid, "The amount of 
work tripled. We even worked on Saturdays. We will not be able 
to handle it if it continues this way" (Deputy Mayor Madokoro). 
  It is a system that was introduced without adequate study. 
The reform of the bidding system without preparation has started 
in chaos. 
  Since the exposure of bribery by general contractors 
commenced, general competitive bidding systems have been 
introduced in rapid succession by central and regional agencies 
ordering public works construction. On 2 July, three days after 
the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Special Investigation 
Department exposed the Sendai incident, Kishiro Nakamura, 
Minister of Construction (at the time) announced the study of an 
introduction of restricted general competitive bidding. Since 
September, actual trials have begun with 13 large construction 
projects of over 1 billion yen. 
  Local governments such as Chiba Prefecture, Hiroshima 
Prefecture, and including Sendai City and Ibaraki Prefecture 
where there have been incidents, have announced plans for 
introduction. Moreover, on 1 October, the Ministry of Home 
Affairs sent out an administrative vice minister circular notice 
seeking an early test of a restricted general competitive 
bidding system on public works construction for prefectures and 
government-ordinance designated cities. 
  The Ministry of Construction had just refused, considering 
that the U.S. demand for introduction of general competitive 
bidding was removed from the existing agenda in review talks on 
the U.S.-Japan Construction Conference during the middle of 
June. The actual situation was that they acted hastily in 
response to shock at the incidents and public criticism. The 
introduction of restricted (conditions) general competitive 
bidding is now being treated as a trump card for rectifying 
construction corruption such as dango [bid-rigging by collusion] 
and bid determination by "the voice of heaven" directed at a 
rigged system. 
  Indeed, much of the bidding corruption discovered so far has 
been related to the strong power of order placers in the 
designated competitive bidding system. However, has that alone 
invited bidding impropriety and is reform of the bidding system 
really linked to eradication of dango? There is no proof of that. 
  The series of system reforms has been put in motion without 
adequate debate. 
  "It is not that corruption will completely disappear if 
system A is replaced by system B" (Ministry of Construction 
bureau director level officer). Many people involved with 
construction view rather coolly the recent moves to reform the 
system. "Inherently, the bidding system is conducted for the 
purpose of ordering good-quality public works construction as 
cheaply as possible. Bidding impropriety is a problem in 
application of the system" (Tokonosuke Hasegawa, managing 
director of the Construction Economy Research Institute). 
  Compared to the United States and Europe, where penal 
servitude is applied to the crime of bid-rigging, penalties are 
light in Japan for economic crimes such as construction dango. 
Only discussion of an entrance system which lacks the concept of 
control is proceeding. 
<H5>  Actual State of Dango </H5>
  By what kind of system is dango, coordination by businesses 
in receiving orders, a common practice in public works 
construction orders in Japan, conducted? Let's look at the 
example of the "Saitama Doyokai," a bid-rigging organization in 
Saitama that was forced to dissolve in June 1991 when exposed by 
the Fair Trade Commission. 
  In Saitama Prefecture, qualifications to participate in 
designated competitive bidding is determined by the scale of the 
construction work ordered. A five-step ranking system of Circle 
A, A, B, C, and D is made by examination of business, etc. 
Members of the Doyokai are of the highest Circle A rank. There 
were 66 companies when it disbanded. All have home offices 
outside of the prefecture and are affiliated with major firms in 
the industry within the prefecture. It is operated with the 
objective of gathering together the persons responsible or 
semi-responsible at the branches or business offices and 
coordinating receipt of orders for all the civil engineering 
construction work ordered by cities, towns and villages in the 
prefecture. 
  "As a rule, the prospective winner is decided among members 
who want to receive the order for each construction project. In 
discussions for this purpose, every fiscal year the members 
submit to the Doyokai a document called the `PR memo' which 
lists about 15 plus 10 of the construction work orders wanted. 
Meetings are held depending on the necessity, and the 
prospective winner is determined by such evaluation criteria as 
whether a memo was submitted, time of submission, accuracy of 
details, and past construction record related to said 
construction work," testified a former member of the Doyokai on 
the method of operation at a hearing by the Fair Trade 
Commission. 
  Afterwards, the members who were designated by the order 
placer contacted each other on bid prices for each member 
participating in the bid to be certain of receiving the order. 
It is said there were no accidents where "a mistake was made" 
and a business other than the prospective winner successfully 
got the bid or acts of betrayal while this member was enrolled. 
  The officer of a business office of a different company 
which 
had become a member explains the motive for coordinating receipt 
of orders, "It is because we did not want to go so far as 
accepting orders at a loss by bashing each other in competition." 
  However, the officer of a major general contractor that 
participated in the Doyokai explains, "Even though they say 
there was coordination in receipt of orders, it was not done 
systematically. The actual situation in getting construction 
work orders is excessive competition everywhere, and though they 
say there is bid-rigging, there still is a fierce scramble for 
work." Naturally, a dango organization will not function 
perfectly just by a discussion among businesses on equal terms. 
  In the Doyokai, the officers controlled traffic in their 
role 
as elders. "When a member came with a memo for consultation, we 
provided information in advance and or instructed him to abandon 
it" (Doyokai officer). When a decision is not easily made after 
discussion, the officers arbitrate. "In arbitration on large 
construction projects such as dams, it seems there even were 
cases of a voice of heaven from the private secretary of the 
former governor, Yawara Hata" (Toshio Tajima, chief, 
Administrative Office, Saitama Doyokai Dango Resident Plaintiff 
Group). 
  The greatest part of the coordination is "relief aid" that 
is 
passed around in the form of subcontracts for a certain 
percentage of the construction work total from the construction 
work order received so as not to generate dissatisfaction among 
members because of bias in the record of receiving orders. This 
is equivalent to a contract violation if they are not publicly 
announced as a subcontracting business when the order is 
received and is generally called a surreptitious joint 
[venture]. This "relief aid" is considered more integral than 
coordination in receiving orders. 
  Jotaro Yabe, chief of the Economic Department, Federal Trade 
Commission, explains that, "In order for such dango 
organizations to function, naturally, information leaks from the 
order placer play a big role." As in the previous testimony, 
information about construction work that becomes the deciding 
factor in determining the prospective winner in the dango 
organization can only be known by the order placer before the 
bidding is publicly announced. 
  Furthermore, for the prospective winner to make certain that 
he will receive the order before the bidding, he invariably 
distributes a "chit" to the businesses designated to participate 
in the bidding along with him, being thoroughly clear in stating 
the respective amounts to be entered. It is something that 
cannot be done unless they know beforehand the estimated price 
calculated by the order placer and the lowest bid price. From 
the view of the order placer, an order can be placed within the 
price range estimated and it has merit in that administrative 
procedures become smooth. Thus, the dango organization has also 
involved the order placer. 
<H5>  Deeply Rooted Cartel Constitution </H5>
  Yabe, chief of the Federal Trade Commission Economic 
Department, views dango organizations in the construction 
industry as "being organized in most order-placing agency units 
nationwide." Furthermore, as a factor for dango becoming chronic 
in the construction industry, he explains that "cartels arise in 
industries where there is excessive competition as well as where 
there is only price competition and commodity differentiation is 
impossible. The construction industry is the greatest one of 
those." 
  Under industry protection policy, the number of construction 
businesses currently approved by the minister and governor has 
ballooned to 520,000 companies. Among these, it is estimated 
that at least 30,000 companies have received orders for public 
works construction in the form of a general contract. In Saitama 
Prefecture, there are 66 companies with the highest rank in the 
Doyokai membership alone. About 30 companies are in the A rank 
companies of the Ministry of Construction Regional Construction 
Bureaus. It is an industry with excessive competition not 
usually seen in other industries. 
  Furthermore, according to Director Etsusuke Masuda of the 
Tokyo Branch of Solomon Brothers Asia Securities who is 
knowledgeable about technical innovations in the construction 
industry, "For the most part, construction is now what is called 
a mature technology. Even in civil engineering, where there is 
great room for technical innovation, when new technology is used 
in public works construction, it must be disclosed to receive 
approval of the authorities. There is little advantage for 
technical innovation in the business aspect." When there is 
competition for orders, inevitably only price competition called 
"bashing each other" can occur. 
  For this reason, the construction industry spontaneously 
cultivated the habit of avoiding competition by dango. An 
officer of a midsized general contractor explains this process 
by dividing it into four steps. 
  "For construction work or construction areas that we have 
been involved in for some time or construction work in places 
where there are deep ties with that business, we are silent as 
the moral code of the industry and approve receipt of the order 
by a specified business. That is the first step. The second step 
is the method of deciding by discussion with fellow businesses 
who among them wants to do it. This is a method that is possible 
because bidding participants are limited by the designation 
system and we know who the competitors are. Coordination is made 
based on a performance sheet called the score sheet." 
  However, in many cases, because there is underlying 
excessive 
competition, coordination cannot be easily made just among the 
businesses. In that case, the existence of a high-ranking 
arbitrator becomes necessary. 
  "The third step is when industry big shots or bosses become 
the arbitrators. Until now, it has been independent coordination 
on receiving orders by businesses. In this case, the boss and 
the business negotiate directly. 
  "However, if a strong boss does not appear from among the 
businesses, ultimately an arbitrator is sought outside. It takes 
the form of calling on a person who has rather strong authority. 
This is the fourth step. Since the current dango system itself 
is premised on bid prices, construction work information, and 
designation, there is a high degree of dependence on the order 
placer. So, it calls for strong authority in placing orders. It 
is a Construction-zoku Diet member in a field such as river 
river control, or the head of a local government. You might say 
that they stand at the pinnacle of the dango system." 
  When there are many who want to receive the order for large 
projects, they issue the so-called voice of heaven; the dango 
system has become a form which accepts that, and the prospective 
winner is decided. Since the boss is a person outside the 
industry, it becomes a much more arbitrary decision than 
coordination on receiving orders. By seeking voice of heaven 
arbitration, a rebate battle spreads among businesses. Sendai 
and Ibaraki are typical forms of this. 
  In both Sendai City and Ibaraki Prefecture, the large 
construction work was crowded with the largest general 
contractors who staked their honor with the aim of receiving the 
orders. Moreover, in Sendai City, former Mayor Ishii was opposed 
to the boss of the business side in the large dango organization 
that spanned six Tohoku prefectures. Sendai City alone has 
broken away from this organization. Moreover, in Ibaraki 
Prefecture, dango organizations such as the "Ibaraki Doyokai" 
have disbanded and the system of coordination among businesses 
has weakened. 
  There was a large project with total project costs of 70 
billion yen, the moving of Ibaraki Prefecture government 
buildings, and in addition, the reconstruction of the 
prefectural medical university. Fujio Takeuchi, former governor, 
in December of last year, was asked to be a mediator for 
receiving orders at the Ibaraki Prefecture Public Hall by Teruzo 
Yoshino, former chairman of Shimizu Corp., and received 10 
million yen. After that, it is said that the voice of heaven was 
issued. 


Table 1. Steps for Dango 

Step 1                 Silent dango            1) In case of first-term 
                                               construction, to first-term 
                                               contracting company; 2) In 
                                               case of domains such as 
                                               roads, buildings, bridges, to 
                                               company possessing domain; 3) 
                                               In cases of there being a 
                                               company that has researched 
                                               that construction for several 
                                               years such as the Tokyo Bay 
                                               Tunnel, to that company. 

Step 2                 Score sheet             Companies who want to do it 
                                               among 10 designated companies 
                                               discuss it, if 2 companies, 
                                               then 2 companies. On those 
                                               occasions, the "score sheet" 
                                               of past discussions for those 
                                               2 companies carries weight. 
                                               In the case of 4 companies, 
                                               it is tournament style. 

Step 3                 Voice from heaven 1     Without discussion by the 
                                               aforementioned 2 companies to 
                                               4 companies, they 
                                               respectively negotiate with 
                                               rigging boss and boss 
                                               arbitrates. There are many 
                                               cases where boss is chosen 
                                               from industry group. 

Step 4                 Voice from heaven 2     Boss listens to talk from 
                                               designated companies and 
                                               arbitrates. Only the boss 
                                               knows which companies have 
                                               shown interest in doing it. 
                                               There are many cases where 
                                               boss is a politician, 
                                               headman, or their close 
                                               associate. 

Note: In any case, fairness is important so that it will be seen on a score 
sheet. However, there is construction work that they would like to do and 
construction work that they would not like to do, and the boss's authority 
on that point is absolute. In steps 3 and 4, there are many cases where the 
boss designates joint-venture partners. 


  The bidding system, which was a system to eliminate the 
arbitrariness of the order placer, has been completely wrecked 
at this stage. 
<H5>  Abuse of Designated Bidding </H5>
  Kunio Maeda, professor at Fuji University, an expert on the 
inside affairs of the construction industry, explains that "the 
designated competitive bidding system and political adhesion 
have gone hand in hand to shape current construction 
corruption." It has been previously pointed out that the 
designated competitive bidding system is deeply involved in 
forming the unfair structure of the structured construction 
bidding. 
  Exposure of general contractor bribery is continuing and 
almost all the measures to eradicate corruption are aimed at the 
single aspect of reviewing designated competitive bidding. 
  On 29 September, at the third meeting of the special 
committee of the Central Council on Construction Contracting 
Business, an advisory organ to the minister of construction, a 
hearing on expert opinions was conducted. Here, the Fair Trade 
Commission pointed out the problem areas of the current bidding 
system from its experience in investigating construction dango 
in cases of violation of the antitrust law. 
  They cited chiefly problems with application: 1) inability 
to 
regulate arbitrariness of order placer because designation 
criteria are not clear; 2) lack of thorough control of 
confidential information such as estimated prices on which dango 
is premised; 3) split orders, which easily invites sharing by 
businesses; 4) persuasion of being forced into construction work 
at a loss is becoming an element that invites dango; 5) 
excessive demand for formation of joint business entities easily 
invites rigging; 6) when a construction-completion guarantor 
system is required to be established by the other designated 
businesses, there will be no guarantors without participation in 
dango and it becomes a compelling force for dango organizations. 
  Furthermore, Economic Department head Yabe proposes 
approaching a general competitive bidding system as soon as 
possible, saying, "with the current designated competitive 
bidding system basis, the designated businesses are apt to be 
biased to a set scope of people and cooperation among the 
businesses is easily generated. It will be difficult to carry 
out dango if the participants are not fixed." 
  Managing Director Hasegawa of the Construction Economy 
Research Institute also points out that problems with the 
designated competitive bidding system are in its application. He 
stresses that "impropriety is generated from bad use of the 
system. It also can be called a problem of the social background 
and nature of those applying it. The starting point is to return 
to the inherent nature of the bidding system and ensure fairness 
and transparency." 
  "There has been debate about whether it will be resolved 
just 
by becoming general competitive bidding, but the system and 
impropriety should be grasped from different viewpoints. 
Moreover, looking at bidding systems worldwide, a complete 
general competitive bidding system does not exist. In public 
works construction bidding, there is the aspect of maintaining 
construction quality above a certain level as well as price. 
Some restrictions are necessary to ensure construction work or 
the quality of the construction business. The problem lies 
strictly in application, not the form of the bidding system." 
  Kunihisa Ono, director of the Construction Economy Bureau, 
Ministry of Construction, the person in charge of the job of 
reviewing the ordering system, explains that, "even if we 
conduct a general competitive bidding system, it will be 
necessary to attach various conditions. Ranking is another 
method. Transparency of the qualifications screening will be 
important. For example, it will be possible to eliminate the 
arbitrariness of order placers by disclosing the reasons to 
businesses that were left out because of designation or 
qualifications screening." 
  Currently, the limited general competitive bidding that has 
begun to be introduced by various ordering agencies first of all 
accepts applications of businesses desiring to bid, keeping the 
previous ranking, and later narrows the businesses participating 
in the bidding by applying screening criteria according to the 
construction work. There has been repeated study on making the 
screening transparent, but currently it is no more than the 
dimension of eliminating designation beforehand. Debate on the 
application aspect is still belated. 
  Furthermore, no study has been made about whether they were 
forced into a cartel constitution by the system and its 
application. There is the strong aspect that new systems have 
been hastily and prematurely introduced just by including the 
words "general competition." 
<H5>  Crime Is Offset </H5>
  A general contractor officer relates, "Dango inherently 
arises out of the cartel constitution. It will remain even if 
you change the form of the system." 
  "There is the opinion that current elaborate dango systems 
united with order placers will no longer be realized by changing 
the system and application. However, there is bid-rigging in the 
United States and Europe. It will continue to exist in some 
form." This seems to be the general feeling of those involved 
with general contractors. 
  Hiroshi Iyori, consultant to the Mitsubishi Research 
Institute and former chief of the Investigation Department of 
the Fair Trade Commission who exposed a violation of the 
antitrust law in a case of dango by the Shizuoka Construction 
Industry Association that included major general contractors in 
1982, stresses that "serious penalties must be levied, not just 
introduction of general competitive bidding." Hasegawa, director 
of the Construction Economy Research Institute, also points out 
that "The perception that rigging is a crime is weak among both 
businesses and the public. To curb economic crime, those acts 
must be made high risk." 
  The Saitama Doyokai was levied a fine as well as a 
recommendation to disband. The total amount was 1,006,670,000 
yen, a levy of 1.5 percent of the total order received by the 43 
companies considered to have received orders by dango. 
Currently, it has been raised to 6 percent of the total order 
received. This too is somewhat light compared to the penal 
servitude applied in the United States and Europe. 
  "This industry has been created so far by coordination and 
cooperation. It has been rumored that, due to public criticism, 
they will be unable to get public works construction orders 
after their suspension has been removed, but it seems that they 
will be able to occupy the same position as before in the world 
of order coordination in the future." It is Hazama whose 
unprecedented shameful conduct was exposed when the chairman and 
president were arrested in both the Sendai and Ibaraki cases. 
The officer of that influential lending bank coolly relates thus 
about the future. Hazama embraces bad debts due to the collapse 
of the bubble and if it had been another industrial sector, it 
would have fallen into plenty of financial difficulty. 
  However, although its target for orders received this term 
has fallen over 100 billion yen, its is not in a dangerous 
situation. In one case, suspension was two to four months. Even 
with Hazama, which seems to have incurred the greatest damage, 
it is possible that its performance will be restored in three 
years at the minimum. 
  Speaking of impropriety in public works construction 
bidding, 
economically it has become a matter of "fully offsetting the 
crime." That is because the risk of being exposed is too light. 
This fact has become one of the elements why the corrupt 
constitution has been pointed out for a long time, but not 
changed. 
  The case that points out that strengthened penalties will 
become a strong force to curb dango occurred in 1989. The United 
States demanded loss compensation in an amount uncommon in Japan 
of 5-15 billion yen from the members of the "Seiyukai" dango 
organization of businesses with access to Yokosuka Naval Base, 
who the previous year were ordered to pay a fine of 289 million 
yen as violation of the antitrust law. Ultimately, after 
negotiations, 99 companies agreed to pay 4.7 billion yen. 
  "This was powerful. Afterward, since 1990, it has weakened 
outward activities such as disbanding of dango organizations in 
various areas" (Fair Trade Commission source). 
  Being under excessive competition to win, no matter how much 
the system is changed, the conditions for cartels have not 
changed. There is nothing else to stop that activity except 
making the loss sustained from rigging exposure greater than the 
profits obtained from the rigging. Inherently, the order placers 
should have loss compensation for the high priced orders 
received due to rigging, but "that should not be desired in a 
situation where even the order placers are involved in the 
rigging system" (Fair Trade Commission source). 
  The recent review of public works bidding has begun to be a 
chance for reflection on construction corruption, but we are 
proceeding still lacking the most important elements of 
controlling economic crime and strengthening penalties.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Takemura Employs Risky Strategy </F>
Toward Reorganization of the Political World"] 
  [Text] Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura, representative of 
the Sakigake [Harbinger] Party, is employing a risky strategy 
anticipating reorganization of the political world. Since 
leaving the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], he has been in close 
contact with the LDP members who are in favor of political 
reform, such as ex-Prime Minister and Minister of Justice Gotoda 
and others. Recently, however, he is making himself conspicuous 
by making contacts at every strategic juncture with former Prime 
Minister Takeshita, Policy Research Council Chairman Hashimoto, 
and former Secretary General Kajiyama, who still bear resentment 
toward Ozawa, the representative secretary of Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party]. Against this, both Shinseito and Komeito 
expressed their revulsion, calling Takemura's move "an attempt 
to organize a big anti-Ozawa alliance." Thus, Takemura's move 
is creating discord within the coalition government. Distress 
over his move is being voiced even within the LDP's reformist 
group, his old home, that "Takemura is using a forbidden 
strategy," and there is a subtle feeling being created among 
them to distance themselves from him. 
<H5>  Takemura's Influence Is Being Weakened </H5>
  Takemura's fundamental strategy is to maintain friendly 
relations with Prime Minister Hosokawa through the formation of 
a "new new party" with a merger of Sakigake and the Japan New 
Party, and, at the same time, to unite the LDP's "reformist 
group" with the SDPJ's [Social Democratic Party of Japan] 
realistic group consisting of younger members who are to bring 
Yokomichi, governor of Hokkaido, forward as their leader. With 
this current as background, Takemura intends to draw a line 
between him and Shinseito and Komeito within the coalition 
parties, and to take the initiative in steering the government 
without being controlled by Ozawa and his associates. 
  Originally, the most important pillar of this strategy was 
to 
form an alliance with the LDP's reformist group. Takemura has 
been regarded as an important figure within the coalition 
government, comparable to Ozawa, because of his connection with 
Gotoda, who is his senior in the bureaucracy in charge of home 
affairs and to whom he pays respect as his teacher, and Masayasu 
Kitagawa, deputy secretary general, who is Takemura's intimate 
friend as a member of the Mitsuzuka faction before Takemura left 
the party. However, a subtle change has been taking place since 
the middle of November last year when the bills related to the 
political reform were approved by the House of Representatives. 
While lessening his contact with "the reformist group," he has 
been making himself conspicuous by publicly meeting with 
Hashimoto. 
  In dealing with the heiritsu system of single-seat districts 
and proportionally represented districts, Takemura arranged to 
make a compromise proposal allocating 280 seats to the 
single-seat districts, which he reported to the prime minister, 
and tried to obtain preliminary consent within the LDP through 
Gotoda, who is also President Kono's guardian. After all, 
however, both the prime minister and Kono did not give their 
consent. A leading member of the LDP's "reformist group" says: 
"Actually, his proposal was not taken up as a main subject of 
discussion between the ruling parties and the opposition 
parties," and points out that, with this incident partly to 
blame, the influence of the Takemura-Gotoda line has declined. 
<H5>  Takemura Keeps Contacts With Hashimoto </H5>
  The Kitagawa group, which is the leading group within the 
"reformist group," has been regarded as "pro-Sakigake." 
However, it is rather likely that Takemura's side has been 
frequently casting sheep's eyes at the Kitagawa group urging the 
group "to take action promptly." Yet the Kitagawa group is not 
moving as Takemura expects. Persons related to the Kitagawa 
group emphasize: "By all means, we are to act independently. 
Although we may be allied with [Sakigake] on equal conditions 
in the course of reorganization of the political world, it is 
impossible for us to join the Sakigake." 
  After all, Mitsuzuka, chairman of the political reform 
headquarters, on whom Takemura has been relying, and Secretary 
General Mori are not as influential within the party as 
expected. Under the circumstances, Takemura's contact with 
Hashimoto has become frequent not only regarding political 
reform, but also in dealing with such significant matters as the 
liberalization of the rice market and countercyclical measures. 
Now, people know that "Takemura calls Hashimoto whenever an 
important political problem takes place," thus laying a hotline 
between his official residence and the LDP. 
  It is not only Hashimoto with whom Takemura is making 
contacts. He has reportedly talked with Kajiyama, whom he 
opposed in dealing with political reform, several times in an 
attempt to restore their relationship. Even after formation of 
the coalition government, Takemura is supposed to have kept up 
private contacts with Takeshita, who has been his intimate 
friend since he entered the political world, and has received 
Takeshita's advice from time to time. The fact that Takemura is 
making contacts with Hashimoto can be regarded as an indication 
that relations between Takemura and Takeshita's line are being 
tightened. 
  Also, we may understand the situation that Takemura has 
given 
up his reliance on "the reformist group," which is not working 
as he would like, and has clearly expressed his opposition to 
Ozawa by availing himself of the "pro-Ozawa" versus "anti-Ozawa" 
structure that has been in existence since the split of the 
former Takeshita faction. It is certain that Ozawa, who has 
recently been pretending to be taking "a rest," is unhappy about 
such an underhanded move. 
<H5>  Discord Is Being Amplified </H5>
  The prime minister, whom Takemura trusts as his intimate 
friend, also tends to follow the Ozawa line in dealing with the 
political situation. Such being the situation, Takemura is 
certainly in a fix, and it seems inevitable for him, in order to 
secure his influence within the coalition parties, to employ a 
strategy to check Ozawa and his associates by suggesting the 
formation of "a big alliance of anti-Ozawa groups." Yet, as a 
leading member of the LDP's reformist group expressed his 
anxiety that "it will not work if the chief cabinet secretary 
makes contacts with the LDP alone," it is true that Takemura's 
move is amplifying the discord within the coalition government. 
  There is also a feeling within the LDP's reformist group 
that 
"we do not want to be involved in the antagonistic pro-Ozawa 
versus anti-Ozawa structure." It is partly because of this 
feeling that the Kitagawa group and others tend to distance 
themselves from Takemura, who clearly expresses his "anti-Ozawa" 
attitude. Though Takemura has expressed his "anti-Ozawa" line 
by staking his political life on the line in reorganizing the 
political world, it might create a crack in the framework of the 
government if the antagonism between the chief cabinet 
secretary, who is the key person of the government, and the man 
of influence within the coalition parties becomes decisive.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, January 12 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- An 
information came from the competent sources near to the 
Mongolian Government that the Mongolian prime minister is going 
within the next few days to make decisive changes in his 
government. According to them, many ministries will be 
abolished, re-organized on the basis of merging with others. 
This project aims at radical changes in the government 
structure, reduction of expenses on maintaining bureaucratic 
apparatus, and the saved means will be directed to the increase 
of wages and pays of state servicemen. 
  According to these sources, this project is actually solved 
it remains only to wait for a decision of the parliament, which 
will consider this project. P. Jasray has presented his project 
at the government sitting, and also to the steering council of 
the ruling Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party. 
  Running across resistance in both cases, the prime minister 
gave to understand that he is going to realize his project 
within the framework of his powers granted by the Constitution. 
  An issue about expediency of re-organization of the 
government, reduction of the number of ministries is raised in 
Mongolia not for the first time. This issue has been raised not 
once by the Mongolian president, the oppositional forces, and 
also by independent economists.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, January 12. (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
State Great Hural (SGH) session set to consideration of the 
draft law on statistics of Mongolia in the first reading. As it 
was noted at the session of the Mongolian parliament, the task 
of the law on statistics is to define the basic principles of a 
single system of statistical information in Mongolia, regulate 
relations connected with information and statistical research. 
In the draft law reflected are an idea about official and 
unofficial statistics, about official and unofficial 
information, which was not reflected before in the legal acts in 
this respect. According to the draft law, the state and public 
organizations, private economic units and individual citizens of 
the country can carry out official and unofficial statistical 
activity. 
  Discussion of the draft law on statistics continues.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, January 12 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
Constitutional Court of Mongolia, considering the complaints of 
the group of Mongolian citizens on the issue about 
contradictions of many provisions of the law on relations of the 
state and church with the country's Constitution, a number of 
international treaties, including the General Declaration on 
Human Rights, the International Convention on Civil and 
Political Rights, made today a decision, which, as it can be 
said, has satisfied the plaintiffs that much the complaints 
concerned the articles of the law, which, in view of the 
plaintiffs are restricting the human rights on religious 
liberty, on holding a prayer freely, spreading their religious 
convictions, acting on behalf of church, holding religious 
ceremonies; also are discriminating other religions in the 
country, except Buddhism, Islam, Shamanism; are violating the 
rights of foreign citizens to act on the territory of Mongolia 
in accordance with their religious views. 
  As the Constitutional Court considered, the provision of the 
law on leading place of Buddhism is up to the spirit of the 
Constitution about the unity of the Mongolian society, national 
security, and has just a declarative and symbolic character, 
concerning the provision on ban of organizational spreading of 
religion from outside, the judges considered that this also does 
not contradict both the country's main law and international 
rights and duties of Mongolia. 
  But the Constitutional Court gave a commentary to this 
decision, stating that this provision applies only to 
reactionary religions and currents. 
  As far as the provisions of the law, by which a ban is 
imposed on spreading, propagating of religions outside church, 
except Buddhism, Islam, Shamanism, and also on organization of 
any religious actions on the Mongolian territory by foreign 
citizens arrived in the country not on the church line, are 
concerned, the constitutional judges recognized these provisions 
as not corresponding to both the country's Constitution and 
international agreements. 
  The chairman at the court session, after passing a verdict 
of 
the court, officially addressed the foreign citizens present at 
the court examination, gave explanations on some decisions, drew 
their attention to the fact that this is not the last word, the 
verdict of the Constitutional Court will be considered by the 
Mongolian parliament, it was said about a possibility of 
revision by law-makers of some provisions, on which the 
complaints were made. 
  The law on relations of the state and church, which was 
adopted at the end of 1993, has aroused arguments not only in 
the Mongolian society, but, in all probability, had an 
international repercussions. Participation of many foreign 
citizens in the court examination, who represented in the main 
the representatives of Christian churches, and some of whom 
arrived in Mongolia specially on this occasion, is indicative of 
this fact. 
  It has become known from the reliable sources that the 
ambassador of Great Britain to Mongolia at his recent meeting at 
the Mongolian parliament paid attention to the fact that 
consequences of this law would affect not only mutual relations 
between Mongolia and England, but also the international arena, 
as this restricts the human rights and liberties.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, January 12. (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
newspaper ARDIYN ERH informs that the State Great Hural (SGH) 
session finished in the second reading consideration of the 
draft law on struggle with hard drinking, the session discussed 
an issue about revision of pay of high officials in accordance 
with the government resolution on measures on ensuring social 
guarantees of the population. 
  Yesterday the session set to consideration in the first 
reading of the draft law on statistics. 
  Answering questions of the newspaper correspondent, the 
Minister of Health P. Nyamdavaa notes that from August last year 
the law on health insurance of citizens came into force. As the 
minister says, the granting of certificates on health insurance 
to citizens was delayed because of unsatisfactory preparation 
for realization of the law. The minister notes that the local 
authorities should pay attention to the involvement of the 
population in health insurance. 
  The newspaper informs that Major N. Tumurhuyag is appointed 
a 
representative of the press service of the Central State 
Security Department. In an interview with the newspaper 
correspondent N. Tumurhuyag announces that the press 
representatives can get from him information on all issues, 
concerning activity of the department. This does not mean, he 
notes, that it is obligatory for press organs to resort to his 
assistance for direct contact with the leadership of the State 
Security Central Department. N. Tumurhuyag has graduated from 
the Moscow University, he is a lawyer by profession, earlier he 
was engaged in problems of rehabilitation of those suffered on 
political charges. 
  The newspaper publishes the law on legal status of cities 
and 
villages and the State Great Hural resolution on measures on 
realization of this law. 
  The MONTSAME agency newspaper IL TOBCHOO publishes an 
article 
by its political observer L. Purebdorj about the outcome of the 
parliament elections in Russia, including a victory of the 
leader of the Liberal Democratic Party V. Zhirinovskiy at these 
elections. The observer notes that V. Zhirinovskiy's success was 
connected with the still existing maniacal great-power Russian 
chauvinism. As the observer considers, Russian generals and 
communists pin definite hopes on V. Zhirinovskiy. (They hope to 
use him for climbing to the top of power. The observer notes 
that possible success of V. Zhirinovskiy at presidential 
elections can excite definite apprehensions. 
  We hope, writes the observer, that the Russian people will 
not support a striving of the fascist figure for power. 
  The newspaper carries an article about history of foundation 
of the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia in the PRC. In the 
article it is noted that with the downfall of the Manchurian 
Empire in 1911 the Inner Mongols were striving for independence. 
But they failed to gain independence because of machinations of 
communists, writes the author of the article. 
  The newspaper gives a political portrait of the leader of 
the 
Palestine Liberation Organization Yasir 'Arafat. It is noted in 
the article, as 1993 was a significant year in regulation of the 
Middle East crisis. The signing of the agreement between Israel 
and Palestine opened an opportunity for this, and for foundation 
of the Palestinian state.

  [Text] Washington, Jan. 12 KYODO -- The United States and 
Japan may hold a ministerial meeting to address the bilateral 
framework trade talks if no breakthrough is reached at 
subcabinet-level negotiations, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor said Wednesday [13 January]. 
  The two governments have scheduled at least two rounds of 
framework negotiations at deputy ministerial level prior to the 
summit meeting between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and 
President Bill Clinton on February 11. 
  So far, neither Tokyo nor Washington has raised the 
possibility of a ministerial meeting. 
  But Kantor told a news conference Wednesday that "there will 
be probably discussions at the ministerial level" following the 
deputies' meetings. 
  Meanwhile, Japanese officials reported progress on framework 
talks on financial services held in Washington Wednesday. 
  A Japanese official who took part in the negotiations said 
he 
expects an interim report on financial services to be completed 
by the time the first deputies' meeting takes place in 
Washington on January 24. 
  The official warned, however, that conclusion of an interim 
report does not mean that the two sides have settled their 
differences on substantive issues, since the document contains 
primarily a wish list of market access issues that both sides 
want to be addressed. 
  According to the framework accord concluded last July, the 
two countries have until July this year to complete negotiations 
on financial services.

program] 
  [Text] Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura 
commented this morning at a news conference on U.S. Trade 
Representative Michael Kantor's remark that the U.S. Government 
is studying the possibility of reviving the Super 301 provision 
of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act. 
  The provision stipulates retaliation against trading nations 
that refuse to liberalize their markets or discriminate against 
U.S. exports. 
  Insisting that such action would go against the spirit of 
Japan- U.S. economic consultations, Takemura said he would urge 
prudence on part of the United States. 
  [Begin Takemura recording] Our agreement is that we should 
maximize our efforts at dialogue. I think what they are 
proposing would go against the spirit of dialogue. I would like 
to ask that they be prudent as far as remarks on exercising the 
Super 301 provision are concerned. [end recording] 
  Takemura's comments indicated the government would ask the 
United States to be cautious about reviving the Super 301 
provisions.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- Japan voiced concern on 
Thursday [13 January] over a possible move by the United States 
to revive the "Super 301" trade measure through an executive 
order. 
  Saying Tokyo and Washington have agreed to do their utmost 
to 
achieve progress in bilateral framework trade talks, Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference that 
the resurrection of the U.S. measure would run counter to the 
accord. 
  "We want the U.S. to act cautiously," the top government 
spokesman said. 
  "Super 301," in effect from 1988 to 1990, required the U.S. 
Government to conduct an annual review of trade barriers abroad 
and impose trade sanctions if those barriers were not removed 
within a year. 
  Takemura's comment came after U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor said Wednesday the administration of President 
Bill Clinton may renew the punitive measure through an executive 
order in connection with bilateral trade "framework" 
negotiations. 
  "That would be an option," Kantor told a group of Japanese 
reporters. 
  Touching on the framework talks, Kantor said Washington will 
insist on setting quantitative criteria to gauge the openness of 
Japanese markets. 
  Japanese and U.S. negotiators have become bogged down on how 
to define and set "objective criteria" in the negotiations, 
which are being held under the bilateral trade framework accord 
reached last July. 
  Washington wants to use the level of imports in other group 
of seven major industrialized nations as the "norm" for Japan to 
follow. 
  Japanese officials call the U.S. position unacceptable, 
saying such measures would amount to setting aside a specific 
market share for foreign goods and services, tantamount to 
managed trade. 
  Earlier Thursday, a government source also expressed 
displeasure about the potential revival of "Super 301." 
  "Negotiations will be impossible if they are based on 
retaliatory actions," the source said. 
  Stressing that Tokyo will continue efforts to further open 
the nation's markets, the source said Japan and the U.S. should 
talk with each other on the principle of an equal partnership. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will meet Clinton on 
February 11 in Washington to assess progress in the framework 
talks.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- A senior Japanese Foreign 
Ministry official on Thursday [13 January] rapped U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor for hinting at reviving the "Super 
301" trade retaliation clause. 
  "There should not be unilateral measures under the framework 
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade," the official 
said. 
  He criticized Kantor for making "inappropriate" comments in 
the middle of Japan-U.S. trade framework negotiations. 
  Kantor told Japanese reporters in Washington on Wednesday 
that revival of the clause is "an option" for the United States.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
will hold emergency talks next Wednesday in Tokyo about the 
foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor market, the vice 
trade minister said Thursday [13 January]. 
  Vice International Trade and Industry Minister Hideaki 
Kumano 
told a press conference that the Japanese side will seek the 
understanding of their U.S. counterparts by explaining the 
circumstances surrounding a recent fall in the share of foreign 
microchips in Japan. 
  Although the ratio has dropped the absolute quantity of 
foreign microchips sold in Japan has increased, Kumano said. 
  The foreign share of Japan's microchips market during the 
July-September period of 1993 fell below 20 percent for the 
third consecutive quarterly drop. 
  Dissatisfied with the results, U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor asked Japan for an emergency meeting on the matter 
in January. 
  The 20 percent is cited in a 1991 bilateral semiconductor 
trade pact as the share level of foreign-made microchips in 
Japan expected to be achieved by the end of 1992. 
  Under the pact, emergency meetings are provided for if the 
objectives of the arrangement are not being achieved. No such 
consultations have been held so far. 
  The share of foreign microchips in Japan, as calculated by 
the U.S. formula, reached 20.2 percent in the last quarter of 
1992, heading off U.S. sanctions, but has fallen since, to 19.6 
percent in the first quarter, 19.2 percent in the second 
quarter, and 18.1 percent in the third quarter of 1993.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- Bobby Ray Inman, picked as 
the next U.S. defense secretary to replace Les Aspin, is seeking 
to meet his Japanese counterpart Kazuo Aichi as soon as he 
receives the senate confirmation, U.S. Ambassador Walter 
Mondale said Thursday [13 January]. 
  Mondale conveyed Inman's wish to Aichi when he visited the 
Japanese Defense Agency chief, officials said. 
  Aichi also expressed the hope of meeting with Inman at an 
early stage, the officials said. 
  On Aichi's hope for an early visit to the United States, the 
Defense Agency is now trying to arrange a trip but it could be 
delayed until March or later because of Japanese Diet affairs 
and the compilation of the fiscal 1994 budget, official sources 
said. 
  Last December, President Bill Clinton named Inman, a former 
top Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) official, to succeed Aspin 
as defense secretary.

Hata may accompany Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to the 
United States in February, a top Foreign Ministry official said 
Thursday [13 January]. 
  Hosokawa is scheduled to hold a summit meeting in Washington 
with U.S. President Bill Clinton on February 11. 
  Hata has not yet visited the U.S. capital after becoming 
foreign minister last August. 
  Ministry sources said if Hata makes the U.S. trip, he is 
likely to hold talks with U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher to discuss problems involving North Korea's 
suspected development of nuclear weapons, the two nation's 
policies toward Russia in the wake of December's parliamentary 
elections, and policies toward China. 
  Hosokawa is scheduled to visit Washington from February 10 
to 
12 for talks with Clinton to assess the progress of bilateral 
trade framework talks under an accord reached last July.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- Nissan Motor Co. will 
shift to the United States all its manufacturing operations for 
the Sunny model which is sold there, the company's head said 
Wednesday [12 January]. 
  Upon unveiling the new Sunny model, Nissan President 
Yoshifumi Tsuji said the switch was prompted by the appreciation 
of the yen. 
  Nissan has already started to locally manufacture about 70 
percent of Sunny cars sold in the U.S. market. 
  Just less than 120,000 vehicles of 165,000 Sunny cars sold 
in 
the U.S. last year were locally made, with the remainder 
imported from Japan. 
  Tsuji said its new manufacturing plant in Tennessee will be 
in charge of production of all Sunnys from late this year. The 
cars produced there will be put on the U.S. market starting 
1995. 
  Nissan's Zama plant in Kanagawa Prefecture will continue 
making Sunnys for the domestic market, but its production will 
be phased out, as the operation is gradually moved to the Kanda 
plant in Kyushu as part of the company's restructuring program.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- Japan and Russia will 
indefinitely postpone planned working-level talks on a bilateral 
territorial dispute originally set for late January, a top 
Foreign Ministry official said Thursday [13 January]. 
  The meeting, scheduled in Moscow as the first talks on the 
territorial row between the two sides since Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin visited Japan last October, is being postponed at 
Russia's request, the official said on condition of anonymity. 
  The official quoted Russian officials as citing as an 
obstacle mobility of personnel in the wake of Russia's 
parliamentary elections in December. 
  Japan claims four Russian-held islands off the northernmost 
main island of Hokkaido. The islands -- Shikotan, Kunashiri, 
Etorofu and the Habomai islets -- were seized by the former 
Soviet Union at the end of World War II.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- The head of the 
Export-Import Bank of Japan urged Russia on Thursday [13 
January] to carry out more economic reforms in order for the 
country to receive export credits from the semigovernmental bank. 
  The bank is now looking for appropriate fields to which 
export credits could be applied for the country, President 
Mitsuhide Yamaguchi told a press conference. 
  He added quickly, however, that the step is conditional on 
smooth implementation of economic adjustment policies in the 
country. 
  Yamaguchi said Russia's economic reforms need to advance to 
a 
level where it is entitled to receive stand-by credits under an 
economic stabilization scheme by the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF). 
  In October 1991, Japan pledged to provide to Russia 200 
million dollars in export credits by the Export-Import Bank of 
Japan as part of a 2 billion dollar program to promote trade and 
economic activity in the country. 
  Yamaguchi voiced hope that Russia will be fully eligible for 
the IMF's special facility set up for Russia and other nations 
struggling to shift to a market economy. 
  Stand-by credits can be extended only under the new 
facility, 
called the Systemic Transformation Facility (STF). 
  Russia has already received 1.5 billion dollars in the first 
portion of the STF that the IMF pledged last June. 
  Talks are now under way over disbursement of the remaining 
portion of the credit, which does not demand strict criteria as 
imposed under ordinary loans, such as inflation control and 
budget deficit cuts.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- The Paris Club of official 
creditors appears likely to agree on deferring 1 billion dollars 
or so in Russian debt payments falling due in March or April, 
government sources said Thursday [13 January]. 
  The agreement is expected as early as January 17 when the 
Paris Club holds a meeting, the sources said. The Paris Club is 
an informal grouping of creditor nations which meet regularly in 
the French capital. 
  Russia's official creditors so far have agreed to reschedule 
some 15 billion dollars of the country's foreign debt falling 
due last year for 10 years, with a five-year grace period for 
interest payments. 
  They are also to defer Russian debt payments falling due in 
1994 on condition that Russia and the International Monetary 
Fund agree on economic reforms needed for IMF loans. 
  But a majority of Paris Club members now believe that a debt 
rescheduling deal for Russian debt payments falling due by April 
is needed unconditionally as a temporary measure because Russia 
faces slow progress in economic reforms due to political unrest, 
the sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- Japan is opposed to having 
Taiwan President Li Teng-hui attend an informal Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit meeting in Indonesia in 
November, a top Foreign Ministry official said. 
  The official said Japan thinks there is no need to change 
the 
summit format from that of the Seattle meeting last year, and 
added that other APEC member countries are of the same opinion. 
  At China's insistence, the U.S. Government did not invite Li 
to the first summit in APEC's four-year history in Seattle on 
November 20. 
  Instead of Li, Taiwan's top government economic planner 
Vincent Siew attended the 17-member APEC economic forum before 
the summit meeting. 
  The original members of APEC, founded in 1989, are 
Australia, 
Canada, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, the United States, and 
the six members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN) -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, 
Singapore and Thailand. 
  China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan joined the consultative forum 
in 
1991. Papua New Guinea and Chile were also granted admission at 
the Seattle summit.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- Ruling coalition parties 
came up with a proposal Thursday [13 January] to increase 
transparency in Japan's construction market and secure greater 
access for foreign firms, an official said. 
  The coalition parties asked Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
through the Cabinet Secretariat to use the plan in its program 
to help improve the nation's public works bidding systems, said 
Seiji Maehara of the Japan New Party. 
  A project team from the ruling parties on bidding systems 
for 
Japan's public works projects, headed by Maehara, came up with 
the proposal and won approval from coalition policymakers 
Thursday. 
  The ruling parties' proposal calls for an open bidding 
system 
for large-scale public works projects and "objectivity, 
fairness, equality and openness" in bidding for smaller projects 
that would not be subject to open bidding, Maehara told a news 
conference. 
  He said the ruling parties' panel thrashed out its proposal 
in time for cabinet approval of the government's action program 
expected next Tuesday before the January 20 deadline of 
potential sanctions from the United States. 
  "Given the situation, we had to ask the government to 
include 
the ruling parties' views (in the action program)," he said. 
  The ruling parties' project team did not specify the size of 
public works projects that are subject to open bidding. 
  It also failed to show any proposal on a possible halt to 
preferential treatment for U.S. construction firms in bidding 
for Japan's major public works projects. 
  But the panel acknowledged the need to eliminate 
discrimination against foreign participants in public works 
bidding in Japan, Maehara said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- Japan will have to 
shoulder about 15 percent of the United Nations' budget for 1995 
to 1997, up from the current 12.45 percent, following a routine 
rate revision, Foreign Ministry sources said Thursday [13 
January]. 
  Japan will either shoulder 15 percent from 1995, or 13.5 
percent in 1995 and raise it to 15 percent by 1997, the sources 
said. 
  The new rates for the U.N. members' contribution for 1995 
through 1997 will be decided at the U.N. General Assembly next 
fall after a working group on the financial contribution 
compiles a report by around August, they said. 
  It has already been decided that a new method of calculating 
the new rates will be adopted, they said. 
  The U.N. members' contribution rates to the world body's 
budget are revised every three years based on each country's 
economic indicators such as gross domestic product, per capita 
national income and foreign debt. 
  The U.N. budget, compiled for two-year periods, stands at 
2.58 billion dollars for fiscal 1994 and 1995. 
  Japan's U.N. budget share of 12.45 percent currently ranks 
second after the United States, which provides 25 percent. 
  The U.N. is in serious financial difficulties because many 
member countries are in arrears with their contributions and due 
to expanded peacekeeping activities.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- The Rice Price Council on 
Thursday [13 January] approved a Farm Ministry plan to set the 
government selling prices of imported table-use rice at 60 to 84 
percent of the average selling price of standard Japanese rice, 
ministry officials said. 
  The approval came when the Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fisheries Ministry briefed the government advisory council on 
the plan at an informal council meeting, the officials said. 
  They said the ministry is likely to make an official 
decision 
next week on the prices of imported rice, which is scheduled to 
go on sale nationwide in Japan next month. The imported rice 
will be blended with Japanese rice for sale to consumers. 
  Japan is importing rice on an emergency basis due to a bad 
crop in 1993. 
  The prices will be based on two categories of rice -- 
long-grain and short- or medium-grain -- and on the country of 
origin, the officials said. 
  Among the imports, rice from the United States and top-grade 
rice from China, both short- or medium-grain, will be sold for 
16,898 yen per 60 kilograms, 84 percent of the average selling 
price of standard Japanese rice. 
  Long-grain non-glutinous rice from Thailand will be sold for 
11,992 yen per 60 kilograms, 60 percent of the Japanese rice 
price. 
  Major supermarket chains, meanwhile, have started studying 
plans for selling imported rice to consumers. 
  Daiei Inc. said it plans to sell blends of imported and 
domestic rice and expects to eventually replace 100 percent 
top-grade domestic rice with blended rice. 
  Daiei officials said 100 percent imported rice is likely to 
be sold at prices 30 to 50 percent lower than domestic rice. 
  Ito-Yokado Co. said it plans to test-market imported rice at 
limited outlets, beginning in February. 
  Restaurant chain Skylark Co. declined comment on the 
possibility of cutting menu prices by using imported rice. 
  Frozen food manufacturer Nichirei Inc. also declined comment 
on possible price cuts for its products through the use of 
imported rice. The company last year raised its prices for 
frozen rice-based foods.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- The government and the 
ruling coalition plan to compile a budget plan for the next 
fiscal year by February 10, government sources said Thursday [13 
January]. 
  According to their budget-drafting schedule, the ruling 
coalition will work out guidelines on February 3 for compilation 
of the budget and tax reforms for fiscal 1994, starting in April. 
  Based on this, on February 5 the Finance Ministry will 
announce its budgetary plan, which is likely to be adopted as a 
government proposal with few changes on February 10, just in 
time for the summit meeting in Washington between Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  Government sources said the biggest point for debate will be 
how to finance a planned reduction in the income tax. 
  The Social Democratic Party [of Japan], an important force 
in 
the coalition, has been opposed to raising the current 3 percent 
consumption tax rate to offset the income tax cut, an idea 
pushed by the Finance Ministry.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- The seven parties in Prime 
Minister Morihiro hosokawa's coalition government agreed 
Thursday [13 January] to allow owners of inherited property to 
pay the inheritance tax on them in property itself, party 
officials said. 
  The tax relief measure, agreed upon at a meeting of the 
parties' policymakers, is intended for those who inherited land 
between 1989 and 1991 when land prices skyrocketed amid a real 
estate investment boom and plan to pay the tax in installments, 
the officials said. 
  The coalition parties intend to implement the tax relief 
measure as part of tax reforms for fiscal 1994, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP) members held secret talks with the Fair Trade Commission 
(FTC) in February and March of 1992 to broker a deal on a new 
maximum fine for firms violating the Antimonopoly Law by 
bid-rigging, informed sources said Wednesday [12 January]. 
  Those who attended the meetings were members of the LDP's 
panel on the Antimonopoly Law, including former Construction 
Minister Kishiro Nakamura, as well as FTC officials headed by 
former Commission Chairman Setsuo Umezawa, the sources said. 
  On several occasions at a Tokyo hotel and the headquarters 
of 
the LDP, then the ruling party, both sides discussed the size of 
the maximum penalty and decided to raise it to 100 million yen 
from 5 million yen, the sources said. 
  Nakamura, who was the panel's deputy chairman, is facing 
allegations that he received 10 million yen in dubious 
contributions in January 1992 from major construction firm 
Kajima Corp. 
  The negotiations were reportedly tough since the LDP had 
strongly opposed the FTC's proposal in 1991 to raise the penalty 
to several hundreds of million yen. But when the meetings 
started, the LDP relaxed its stance, the sources said. 
  They quoted one participant as suggesting that there must 
have been an arrangement within the LDP on settling the issue 
beforehand. 
  Nakamura reportedly acted as an agent of former political 
kingpin Shin Kanemaru, who has been indicted on charges of 
evading income tax on secret donations from the construction 
industry. 
  Kanemaru and Nakamura are known for having close connections 
with the nation's construction industry and have therefore 
become the center of the current corruption scandal involving 
the industry. 
  It has also been reported that Umezawa explained Nakamura's 
role in a meeting with Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobuo 
Ishihara. 
  After reaching the agreement with the LDP, the FTC announced 
the 100 million yen penalty figure on March 12, 1992.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- A panel of Diet members 
from several political parties drafted a bill Wednesday [12 
January] to establish within parliament an organization that 
will work to streamline the administration, panel members said. 
  The group led by Naoto Kan, a House of Representatives 
member 
of the United Social Democratic Party (Shaminren), will submit 
the bill to the next ordinary session of the Diet beginning on 
January 31, they said. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa serves 
as adviser to the group. 
  Under the panel's plan, the organization would hear 
complaints from the public about the administration, check such 
opinions and report the outcome of the study to the House of 
Representatives speaker or the House of Councillors president. 
  The commission would also advise the lower house speaker or 
the upper house president on enacting or abolishing laws for the 
purpose of cutting administrative organizations. 
  The planned organization would have the right to demand 
administrative bodies to submit documents and to open hearings. 
  The Management and Coordination Agency plans to set up a 
similar organization in the Prime Minister's Office, but the 
group led by Kan doubts the administration can make the 
appropriate cuts on its own, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- The Steering Committee of 
the House of Councillors voted Thursday [13 January] to confirm 
the January 17 date set for a public hearing on the government's 
political and electoral reform bills. 
  The vote in the committee was 12 for and 12 against, and the 
motion was carried with Akira Omori, the committee chairman, 
exercising his casting vote. 
  The public hearing, to be held in Tokyo, is a prerequisite 
to 
putting the bills to a vote in an upper house plenary session. 
  The bills are aimed at revamping the electoral system for 
the 
House of Representatives and tightening political fund-raising 
controls. 
  The upper house's Special Committee on Political Reform 
voted 
Monday to set the date for the public hearing for January 17. 
  The reform bills cleared the more powerful lower house on 
November 18 but have become bogged down in the upper house in 
the face of stiff opposition from the Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP) and the Japanese Communist Party (JCP). 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has vowed to pass the 
package during the current Diet session, which expires January 
29. 
  Several upper house members of the Social Democratic Party 
[of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], one of the ruling coalition parties, 
have expressed opposition to the bills and could vote against 
them or abstain. 
  In the upper house, the ruling coalition has 131 seats, the 
LDP 99, the JCP 11, the Niin Club five, and independents five. 
  At a session of the special committee Thursday, the JCP 
submitted a motion demanding the coalition let Hosokawa's former 
political funds manager Masatoshi Miyama testify before the Diet 
as a sworn witness. 
  The JCP wants Miyama to testify about 100 million yen 
Hosokawa said he received as a loan from the scandal-ridden 
Sagawa Kyubin trucking group and later paid back.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa denied press reports Thursday [13 January] that he is 
considering reshuffling the cabinet immediately after the 
expected passage of political reform bills at the end of this 
month. 
  Hosokawa told reporters that he is "not at all considering" 
a 
cabinet reshuffle. 
  The premier also said the government plans to retain the 
post 
of a state minister in charge of political reform after the 
expected passage of the political reform bills. Sadao Yamahana, 
former chairman of the Social Democratic Party, currently holds 
the post. 
  The YOMIURI SHIMBUN reported Thursday that Hosokawa 
discussed 
the plan to reshuffle the cabinet with Shinseito (Japan Renewal 
Party) co-leader Ichiro Ozawa at the end of last year and is 
studying the timing and scale of the change. 
  The YOMIURI said the reshuffle would be on a limited scale, 
though it was intended to replace Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura and a few other ministers. 
  Takemura, who advocated concessions to the opposition 
Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) on the bills, is likely to be retained in 
the cabinet with a new post, the YOMIURI said. 
  Ozawa, former LDP secretary general, takes an uncompromising 
stance to the LDP. 
  Shinseito is offering cabinet posts to [Social Democratic 
Party of Japan] SDP [SDPJ] executives calling for tightening 
control on party members, sources said. Several SDP[J] House of 
Councillors members have expressed opposition to the bills and 
could vote against them or abstain. 
  The government-proposed package that Hosokawa has vowed to 
push through the Diet during its current session is pending 
before the upper house.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- A group of Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) legislators on Wednesday [12 January] 
blasted two key forces within the coalition government of Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for their alleged "fascist nature." 
  "We must see through and fight the fascist trend that has 
been clearly emerging in politics for the past half year since 
the inauguration of the Hosokawa cabinet," the group said in a 
statement. 
  All group members are legislators of the powerful House of 
Representatives. 
  The 22-member group of the main opposition asserted that 
Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and Komeito, major components in 
the seven-party coalition, want political reform to be achieved 
so as to gain absolute power. 
  A change in the system for House of Representatives 
elections, a centerpiece of the government-sponsored reform 
package, "is a weapon definitely necessary for a political bloc 
forged by Shinseito and Komeito." It described the two parties 
as having a "fascist nature" in their lust for power. 
  "We are saying what nobody else has said, though he or she 
has noticed the signs," lower house member Katsuhiko Shirakawa 
told a news conference. 
  Calling Shinseito and Komeito "authoritarian and autocratic" 
forces, another lower house member, Minoru Noda, said the two 
parties will continue to threaten the nation's parliamentary 
democracy. 
  The coalition and the LDP have been at loggerheads over the 
course of political reform aimed at ending rampant corruption in 
Japanese public life. 
  Hosokawa has staked his political fate on enactment of 
necessary legislation by the January 29 close of the current 
Diet session. 
  Shirakawa and other LDP lower house legislators told 
reporters that they will ask lower house and House of 
Councillors legislators of other political parties to join the 
parliamentary group, temporarily called "The Association of 
Solidarity for Freedom." 
  Shinseito's co-leader, Ichiro Ozawa, is one of the most 
powerful politicians in the coalition and was apparently 
instrumental in establishing the coalition government last 
August after dislodging the LDP from a 38-year-old grip on power 
following the general elections a month earlier. 
  Ozawa is believed to have still exerted strong influences 
behind the scenes and have a strong tie with Komeito Secretary 
General Yuichi Ichikawa. 
  Political analysts said Shinseito and Komeito may unite as 
the next stage of rallying political forces comes around.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- A group of Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) lawmakers on Thursday [13 January] 
accused the ruling coalition of having a "fascist" political 
stance and called for the protection of democracy. 
  "The governing coalition's management of parliamentary 
affairs and its political stance are extremely autocratic and 
authoritarian, and it is undeniable that it is moving in the 
direction of fascist politics," the group said in a statement. 
  "This is a crisis of democracy, and it is now an urgent 
political task to launch an antifascism and prodemocracy 
movement," it said. 
  The group led by House of Representatives member Yoshinobu 
Shimamura issued the appeal after a meeting that brought 
together 32 LDP legislators, one former LDP lawmaker and 31 
proxies of politicians. 
  It also sought advance enactment of anticorruption measures 
without changing the electoral system for the lower house. 
  The lower house election system should be amended along with 
the systems for House of Councillors and local government polls 
after ruling and opposition parties reach a consensus, the group 
said. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has staked his political 
fate on enactment of a reform package featuring electoral 
changes and stricter controls on campaign funding before the 
current extraordinary Diet session ends on January 29.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- Ruling party Shinseito 
(Japan Renewal Party) co-leader Ichiro Ozawa will resume his 
press conference Monday [17 January] for the first time in more 
than two months, his office said Wednesday. 
  The resumption apparently means that Ozawa has agreed to 
Shinseito officials' requests that he meet with reporters. 
  "We hope to respect and understand each other by resuming 
the 
press conferences," the office said. 
  Ozawa had refused to hold press briefings since early 
November as negotiations between him and the media organizations 
deadlocked over his ban of journalists of two major dailies -- 
the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN and the SANKEI SHIMBUN -- from his 
press meetings. 
  Ozawa, a powerful figure of the coalition government led by 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, in late October began 
excluding the two papers' reporters from his news conferences, 
saying their news coverage on him had been inaccurate. 
  Ozawa's office said the two papers will be allowed to attend 
the Monday meeting. 
  The Monday meeting will be held for the first time since 
November 8, when Ozawa held a press conference to tell reporters 
that he had accepted 5 million yen from scandal-plagued Kajima 
Corp. as a legal political donation. 
  The Tuesday edition of the South Korean daily TONG-A ILBO 
carried an interview with Ozawa, in which he was quoted as 
saying that the Japanese mass media are mean and inhuman hordes 
that only criticize.

Burma (DAB) to the negotiating table have always been rejected 
by Slorc. [passage omitted] 
  The Karen general said he would consult the DAB before 
meeting Slorc representatives and he hoped a DAB meeting 
tomorrow would come up with a resolution on the issue. 
  He blamed the failure of previous peace negotiations between 
the Karen and Rangoon--in 1949, 1962 and 1963--on successive 
Burmese governments and said "the Karen do not want to see 
disunity among all ethnic minorities. Instead they want to help 
to create democracy, human rights and freedom in the country." 
  Bo Mya later told reporters that the Karen National Union 
decided to enter talks with Slorc at the junta's invitation. 
The meeting, he said, has to take place in a country that 
recognises the negotiations and not inside Burma. He declined 
to disclose conditions of talks but said the forum would 
concentrate on political aspects. 
  Informed sources in the All Burma's Students Democratic 
Front 
said the Burmese military attache to Thailand, Col Thein Swe, 
told Gen Bo Mya in a brief meeting arranged by Thai mediators 
and officers early this month in Mae Hong Son that Slorc was 
willing to meet the Karen but not the DAB. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The coordination meeting between the visiting 
working group from the Development of Border Areas and National 
Races [DBANR] and the Kachin Independence Organization [KIO] for 
regional development in Kachin State Special Region No. 2 was 
held at 0800 on 12 January at the Meeting Hall in the office of 
the chairman of the Kachin State Law and Order Restoration 
Council [LORC] in Myitkyina. 
  In his address, Major General Saw Lwin, chairman of Kachin 
State LORC and commander of northern military command, explained 
that the meeting was held so that personnel of the local KIO and 
the DBANR groups could meet and hold talks in order to increase 
the momentum of development in the region. He said economic, 
social, and other development activities in the Kachin State 
could not be carried out as in other states due to climatic and 
transportation difficulties. The commander reiterated that 
development activities have been carried out nationwide since 
1988, when the State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC] 
took over the responsibilities of the nation. They are being 
implemented with cooperation and coordination from regional 
organizations at various levels. 
  Saw Lwin added that, in implementing regional development 
activities for the development of border areas and national 
races, and in accordance with SLORC guidelines, development 
programs will be conducted in three stages. The first stage 
involves activities directed from the central level; the second 
stage involves Kachin State level activities; and the third 
stage concerns district level works. Maj. Gen. Saw Lwin then 
asked to be excused if any weaknesses or imperfections occurred 
in implementing the development works and noted that every 
effort will be made to the best of the ability of those involved 
to ensure the projects are a success. 
  He requested that local KIO personnel regroup villagers who 
have vacated their villages and places of abode for various 
reasons due to insurgency and told them about the need to 
nurture the education, health, and economic development of 
villagers. Continuing, the commander noted that villages must 
be systematically reorganized according to their prevailing 
needs, and the chosen localities should have suitable regional 
and climatic conditions. Maj. Gen. Saw Lwin added that 
long-term and long-term plants and fruit trees should be planted 
for the benefit of future generations, with preference given to 
commercial and important plants. He then explained that the 
main transportation routes for commercialization are being built 
by the Kachin State LORC with cooperation from higher 
departments. He noted the need for cooperation by the KIO in 
building these roads, and explained the frankness and goodwill 
in implementing development activities for the benefit of future 
generations; that they can be proud of. Finally, Maj. Gen. Saw 
Lwin urged cooperation and coordination in fulfilling the 
development tasks, keeping in mind the love of country and 
patriotism. 
  The commander then introduced KIO leader U Lamung Tugyaing 
and his party to personnel from the DBANR working group and 
Kachin State departmental officials. The commander then 
presented the KIO leaders with gifts -- 400 pieces of clothing 
-- for the local people in the Kachin Independence Army [KIA] 
First Brigade region.

<F P=106> [By Patrick Lescot] </F>
  [Excerpts] Bangkok, Jan 11 (AFP) -- The future of a unified 
opposition in Burma and the opening of talks with its ruling 
military junta are the key points of discussion at a meeting of 
the Democratic Alliance of Burma (DAB), officials said here 
Tuesday. 
  The meeting, which opened Monday in Mannerplaw, the DAB's 
headquarters at the border between Burma and Thailand, comes as 
joint pressure from China and Thailand has already resulted in 
part of the opposition negotiating a separate ceasefire with the 
junta in Rangoon. 
  "We are scared of a border closure by Thailand, which would 
mean no more medical supplies for us," Em Marta told AFP. 
  Marta is in charge of the foreign affairs department of the 
National Karen Union (KNU), the oldest and most powerful 
insurgent group fighting the Rangoon junta and whose positions 
lie right on the border with Thailand. 
  According to Marta, the probability of the border's closing 
is something "we very much worry about and is the main reason" 
that the KNU has asked the DAB for a mandate to negotiate with 
the junta on behalf of all the opposition's various factions. 
[passage omitted] 
  Marta said the "the SLORC doesn't matter so much, but with 
Thailand, it is another story. We feel the pressure is coming 
[words indistinct]. He was referring to recent measures by the 
Thai Government to limit and control the Burmese opposition 
operating in Thailand. 
  The Burmese armed forces in December attacked positions held 
by Karens, killing five and injuring three, and suffering 20 
dead and 30 injured in their own ranks, according to a Karen 
spokesman. [passage omitted] 
  A founding principle of the movement was the refusal to 
negotiate as separate factions with the junta. 
  "We need a mandate, or at least the support of the DAB, to 
negotiate," Marta said, adding that the first priority would be 
to obtain a ceasefire. 
  "We feel that Burma needs peace," Marta said. "At this 
point, 
there are no more preconditions." 
  The DAB had sought the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, winner 
of 
the Nobel Peace Prize and opposition leader, who has been under 
house arrest since 1989, but this may no longer be a term, he 
said. 
  He cautioned, however, "if there is no political concession 
(by the SLORC), such a ceasefire would only be temporary."

  [Text] Cambodia has reassured Prime Minister Chuan Likphai 
it does not believe Bangkok is supporting the Khmer Rouge and 
that it will honour all previous business agreements that are 
judged "fair". 
  The reassurance from Cambodia's first Prime Minister Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh came after Chuan, making his first official 
visit to Phnom Penh, reaffirmed that Thailand does not help any 
group not a part of the legitimate government of Cambodia. At 
the same time, Chuan and his official delegation sought 
assurances that Phnom Penh would protect legitimate Thai 
investment in Cambodia while weeding out business people seen to 
be exploiting the country. 
  Prince Ranariddh spoke to reporters after meeting with 
Chuan. 
  "The meeting has made progress and smoothened our 
relationship," Prince Ranariddh said. Also present at the 
meeting was Cambodia's second Prime Minister Hun Sen. 
  Chuan told the Cambodian premiers that as Bangkok does not 
want anyone to interfere in its internal affairs, it has never, 
and will never, intervene in Cambodia's domestic issues, 
especially as far as the Khmer Rouge is concerned. 
  Chuan's closed-door meeting with Prince Ranariddh and Hun 
Sen 
was also attended by Thai Defence Minister Gen Wichit Sukmak, 
his Cambodian counterparts Gen Tie Banh and Gen Tea Chamrat, 
Thai Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri and Cambodian Foreign 
Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut. 
  Prince Sirivut had recently demanded that Bangkok state 
specifically which group, the Cambodian govemment or the Khmer 
Rouge, it supported. 
  Thai government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa said the 
Cambodian officials told Chuan they were grateful to Thailand 
for playing a major role in helping to restore peace and for 
assisting in full reconstruction and reconciliatiun. 
  Both sides agreed to more direct contact in the future to 
avoid misunderstandings from escalating into major problems. 
  An informed source at the meeting said Prince Sirivut blamed 
the media for exaggerating his demand for clarification from 
Chuan. 
  Meanwhile, Chuan asked Phnom Penh to take tough action 
against Thais involved in illegal activities in Cambodia, but 
demanded fair treatment and protection for legitimate businesses. 
  "Cambodia reaffirmed it had no intention of revising 
agreements that Thais have signed with previous Cambodian 
governments for any benefit. 
  "It reiterated it would honour the agreements," he said. 
  Chuan raised the issue at the meeting with Prince Ranariddh 
and Hun Sen. Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan, Finance 
Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin and Wichit Suphinit, governor of 
Bank of Thailand, were at the meeting. 
  Chuan said there were some companies operating in Cambodia 
without an agreement. But Phnom Penh had promised to discuss 
some arrangements with the companies based on mutual interest. 
  Cambodia's Economic and Finance Minister Sam Rangsi said his 
government would honour "good" agreements. 
  Chuan said this confirmation would create more confidence 
among Thai investors in Cambodia. 
  Because Cambodia was still in the transition stage of its 
reconstruction and rehabilitation, it had yet to set up an 
organization to handle economic and trade issues. 
  Cambodia agreed in principle to a Thai proposal to upgrade a 
temporary border checkpoint in the Sa Kaeo-Poipet area to 
permanent checkpoint. 
  However Cambodian officials asked for more time to study the 
details of the proposal. 
  National Security Council Gen Charan Kullawanit said 
Cambodia 
needed more time because it did not have enough qualified 
customs and immigration personnel to man the checkpoint. 
  Officials are still being trained, he added. 
  Aphisit said the two governments agreed that permanent 
checkpoint would boost trade and help each country to collect 
trade taxes. 
  The meeting agreed to conduct more studies into the Thai 
proposal to have 11 body to oversee the boundary, and another 
body to coordinate border issues.

  [Text] Senior Cambodian military officers have denied that 
they made accusations about Thailand's support of the Khmer 
Rouge. They believed the accusations were made by groups wanting 
to create disputes between Thailand and Cambodia. 
  Cambodian Defense Minister General Tie Chamrat said the 
following at an interview during his visit to a Thai Supreme 
Command unit in Chachoengsao. He said the reports about Thai 
support for the Khmer Rouge's attack against Cambodian 
government soldiers were manufactured by the media, which used 
his name to give credence to the reports. The reports were 
absolutely untrue. 
  [Begin Tie recording in Cambodian] The reporters asked good 
questions. They were young and beautiful and asked good 
questions. I, the defense minister, have never talked about the 
Khmer Rouge issue. Reports were written by reporters. For 
myself, I have never written such reports. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, General Yim Savi, the director of the Cambodian 
Defense Ministry's Logistics Department, confirmed during a 
function in Sa Kaeo Province to receive delivery of 9,999 Army 
uniforms from the Thai Government that the Cambodian Government 
has never accused Thailand of supporting the Khmer Rouge. He 
said the reports were written by people who wished to see 
disputes between the two neighboring countries.

  [Excerpts] Poipet, Cambodia, Jan 12 (AFP) -- The Khmer 
Rouge blew up a new bridge along Cambodia's national Route 5 as 
guerrillas burned tracts of ricefield, government and military 
officials said Wednesday. 
  The guerrillas attacked government troops guarding the 
bridge 
along Route 5 at Phum O Snguot, south of Sisophon, in Banteay 
Meanchey province, a military official in the capital Phnom Penh 
said. 
  A government officer told reporters on the Thai-Cambodian 
border that one government soldier was killed and three injured 
in the 30-minute firefight -- one guerrilla was also killed. 
  The guerrillas proceeded to use landmines to destroy a 
5-meter (16.5 foot) stretch of the bridge, the military official 
said. 
  The bridge was renovated by Thai military engineers and is 
just some 60 kilometers (37 miles) south of another bridge at 
the Thai- Cambodian border, which Thai Prime Minister Chuan 
Likphai will official open Thursday, the government officer 
said. [passage omitted] 
  The ceremony would not be affected by Wednesday attck as 
Chuan, along with co-premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun 
Sen, were scheduled to arrive here by helicopter. 
  Tanks and armoured personnel carriers were moved into Poipet 
as protection for the visit, a government officer at the border 
said. 
  As preparations were being made to boost protection for the 
visiting dignitaries, fresh fighting erupted in Phum Takong Krao 
about 18 kilometers to the south, the latest in a series of 
clashes between the government troops and the Khmer Rouge in the 
area. 
  In northern Preah Vihrear province, Khmer Rouge guerrillas 
burnt more than one thousand acres (400 hectares) of ricefields, 
Ministry of Information spokesman Sieng La Presse said. 
  "This is the harvest season and they try to sabotage the 
economic system of the royal government by burning rice, 
threatening the lives of peasants and cutting the roads so they 
cannot move their produce to the market," he said. 
  Sieng La Presse said guerrillas were operating a "hit and 
run" strategy, attacking a village at night and burning the 
houses, killing livestock and destroying paddies. [passage 
omitted] 
  Earlier, Prince Ranariddh said he had "a very good meeting" 
with the Thai premier, commenting: "There's progress when the 
Thai side says they never provide any support for the Khmer 
Rouge." [passage omitted]

  [Text] A seminar on investment and the Cambodian economy 
was held at the Cambodiana Hotel this morning. At the seminar, 
Sam Rangsi, Cambodian economy and finance minister, said the 
Cambodian national budget faces constraints and financial 
reserves are dwindling. The Cambodian Government has attempted 
to undertake economic restructuring in order to become 
self-reliant. Two measures have been planned to achieve this: 
Economic policy must be continuous, laws must be transparent, 
and foreign investors must be screened; and also the Cambodian 
Government will soon devalue the riel to make the currency 
stronger. According to the Cambodian finance minister, six 
months have passed since the formation of the new Cambodian 
Government, but the economy has not yet reached a stage that 
will attract investors. The government does not have enough 
money to pay the salaries of officials. This could lead to 
demonstrations. For this reason, the Cambodian Government has 
accelerated the targeted collection of taxes to stabilize the 
country's economic position.

"Deliberate Maneuvers To Aggravate Tension"] 
  [Text] The South Korean puppets continue, in the new year, 
to conduct daily war exercises with the U.S. imperialists 
against the North, thus straining the situation on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  As was reported, on 9 January, the U.S. imperialists 
conducted electronic jamming by flying electronic intercept 
planes in the skies above Suwon, Hoengsong, Chunchon, Paju, and 
Pochon and conducted an aerial electronic war exercise against 
the North with a huge number of combat planes mobilized from 
overseas bases and air corps belonging to the U.S. occupation 
Air Force based in South Korea. 
  Since the beginning of the new year, South Korean puppets 
have conducted joint aerial war exercises against the North with 
the U.S. imperialists, and on ground, have conducted night 
attack operation exercises aimed at breaking through the 
Military Demarcation Line [MDL]. On 6 and 7 January, they drew 
hundreds of armed rascals in an area near the MDL and the DMZ 
and fired hundreds of shots from large-caliber machine guns and 
automatic rifles, thus agitating us extremely. 
  They then mobilized squadrons of the puppet army's combat 
planes to support ground-attack units and squadrons of armed 
helicopters flying at very low altitudes to conduct 
missile-firing convergence exercises aimed at striking targets 
in the area along the coast of the northern half of the Republic 
and frantically engaged in war exercises. All this is a 
deliberate and planned game of playing with fire [puljangnan] 
aimed at driving the situation to the brink of war by 
aggravating tensions on the Korean peninsula. It is a very 
alarming move. 
  As has already been reported, the puppet defense minister 
said on 3 January that the Army, Navy, and Air Force should 
maintain a strong combat posture this year, too. The chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff also made bellicose remarks that 
the military should adopt a posture ready to cope with someone's 
war threat, to assume prompt counteraction, and the like. 
Meanwhile, in a so-called New Year's press conference, traitor 
Kim Yong-sam noisily talked about modernization of the puppet 
army and establishment of a security posture. Judging from the 
recent series of warmongers' bellicose outbursts and war 
exercises from South Korea, we can clearly predict that the 
puppet Kim Yong-sam clique will dash even harder this year, into 
a war provocation against the North. 
  A year remains before our people face the 50th anniversary 
of 
national division by outside forces. This sorrowful reality 
urgently demands that our people unite firmly as one by 
overcoming differences of ideology and systems to launch 
ourselves onto the road of reunification and patriotism. In 
response to this urgent demand of the times and the national 
aspiration, all fellow countrymen in the North, the South, and 
overseas are vigorously advancing toward unity and 
reunification, not confrontation and division. 
  The situation around us is also developing in a favorable 
way 
for fatherland reunification as a breakthrough for resolving the 
nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula has been found through 
DPRK-U.S. contacts. 
  At this time, the South Korean puppets are aggravating 
tensions by conducting war exercises against the North in an 
obsolete way. Again this clearly shows that they pursue 
South-North confrontation without any interest in peace or 
reunification. This also intolerably challenges the national 
aspiration for peace and reunification. The South Korean 
puppets conduct war exercises against the North like fools 
rushing in where angels fear to tread. Their maneuvers are 
nothing more than thoughtless and foolish acts. If they dare to 
provoke us, we will sternly punish the provokers. 
  The puppet Kim Yong-sam clique will gain nothing by driving 
the tensions on the Korean peninsula into a state of acute 
confrontation. The only thing it can gain is its ruin. The 
South Korean puppets should look straight at the situation and 
had better not run wild recklessly.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 13 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Yong- sam, a puppet, a few days ago invited the traitors Chon 
Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, dictators of the "Fifth and Sixth 
Republics", to "Chongwadae" [presidential office] and solicited 
their "active cooperation". And the two military dictators 
expressed "thanks" for his "magnanimity" and accepted the 
request. 
  The fact that the traitor Kim Yong-sam kissed the dictators 
of the "Fifth and Sixth Republics" at the beginning of the new 
year bespeaks that he chose to openly collude with his 
predecessors, say press commentaries here today. 
  A news analyst of NODONG SINMUN says: 
  Kim Yong-sam the puppet is a born fascist and traitor. That 
is why he, while talking about "liquidation of the past" and 
"reforms", has defended and protected the chief culprits in the 
Kwangju massacre and is now taking the road of treachery, 
fascism, confrontation and war by succeeding to the military 
dictatorial system of the "Fifth and Sixth Republics" without 
any reform. 
  It is crystal clear that the traitor Kim Yong-sam who came 
to 
power through his political marriage to the dictators of the 
"Fifth and Sixth Republics" can neither part with them nor 
enforce reforms in South Korean society. 
  The puppet Kim Yong-sam is intending to find a way out in 
openly joining hands with the military dictators of the "Fifth 
and Sixth Republics" who have been forsaken by the people, but 
it is a foolish dream. 
  A commentary of MINJU CHOSON says the traitor Kim who has 
been driven to a tight corner, isolated from and rejected by the 
people at home and abroad, is trying to prolong his remaining 
days at any cost with the help of the successive military 
fascist dictators. This is the last-ditch effort of the doomed, 
notes the commentary.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 13 (KCNA) -- The spokesman of the 
General Federation of National Peasants Associations of South 
Korea (Chonnong) at a recent press conference denounced traitor 
Kim Yong- sam's policy of killing farmers, according to a report 
of a South Korean newspaper. 
  He said Kim Yong-sam's promise in his election "commitments" 
to adopt a policy for the farmers was a lie to fool them. 
  Noting that Kim Yong-sam, disclosing his true color, has 
taken today the road of totally sacrificing agriculture and 
farmers with the measure of rice market opening, he declared 
that Chonnong would resolutely turn out in the struggle to 
defend "our rice, our agriculture".

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 12 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
puppets on January 8 worked out what they call "timetable for 
establishing an agricultural policy" regarding rice market 
opening and are making quite a noise as if the "committee for 
the development of rural and fishing villages" which will be 
formed by the end of this month would "increase the competitive 
power of agriculture and fisheries" and "improve living 
conditions in the rural and fishing villages." 
  Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says: 
  What they are doing is a disgusting act of a political 
charlatan who causes illness and then administers medicine. 
  Since the puppets declared rice market opening, they must 
take measures to block the unrestricted flooding of American 
agricultural products such as building a higher customs barrier, 
if they want to prevent losses from it. But a "meeting of 
ministers concerned" of the puppet administration did not 
discuss such active measures but put on the order of the day 
"support" to agriculture through the collection of a new 
"special tax" and establishment of an "advisory body". What 
effect would such "measures" of the puppets have? In fact, this 
is an act to cut the lifeline of the 6 million peasants by 
market opening and kill all the people by forcing a "special 
tax" on them under the pretext of "support" to them. 
  It is impossible that the traitor Kim Yong-sam, a top- class 
flunkeyist who did not hesitate to open the rice market of South 
Korea to win the favour of his U.S. master, takes a measure to 
defend the South Korean peasants and agriculture in disregard of 
the interests of his master. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group's talk about "measures" and the like 
is aimed at creating the impression that it is concerned over 
the peasants suffering losses and thus lulling their 
ever-growing grievances and bridging over the worsening crisis 
of its rule.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 12 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
people and overseas Koreans are voicing support to "10-point 
programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the 
reunification of the country" put forward by the great leader 
President Kim Il-song. 
  A dissident pack in Seoul said he believed that only when 
the 
70 million Koreans were closely united as one under the banner 
of the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole 
nation, could great national harmony and the historic cause of 
national reunification, the desire of the Korean nation, be 
achieved despite the grim situation caused by continued acute 
confrontation between the North and the South. 
  A student of Korea University surnamed Yi said: "The supreme 
task facing our nation is to reject foreign forces and reunify 
the country through a great unity of the whole nation. The 
programme of the great unity of the whole nation put forward by 
President Kim Il- song clearly indicates the way of representing 
and defending the common will and interests of the nation as 
well as the interests of every member of the nation, 
transcending the differences in ideology and ideal, religious 
belief and social system." 
  A certain Ri, a journalist of SEOUL SINMUN, said: 
"Intolerable is the attitude of the South Korean authorities who 
oppose fellow countrymen and refuse reunification because of 
their `ideology- first' cold war mode of thinking. The 10-point 
programme must be welcomed and supported as a great charter 
opening the way for great national unity and indicating the road 
to reunification." 
  The Canadian headquarters of the National Alliance for the 
Country's Reunification and the Consultative Conference for the 
Promotion of the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland issued 
a joint statement, praising the 10-point programme. They said 
the programme closely combined democracy with the reunification 
issue, thus confirming that reunification and democracy are 
inseparable from each other and the unified country must be a 
democratic state.

<F P=106> ["Unattributed talk": "Our Party's Economic Strategy Is </F>
Revolutionary Line for Effecting New Upsurge in Socialist 
Construction"] 
  [Text] In his New Year address, the great leader Comrade 
Kim Il-song proudly summed up achievements in last year's 
struggle and put forward militant tasks that our party and 
people should adhere to in the new year. Thus, he called on 
them to thoroughly implement our party's economic strategy. 
  We should thoroughly carry to accomplishment the 
agriculture- 
first, light industry-first, and trade-first policy in socialist 
economic construction during the upcoming three years, which 
were designated as an adjustment period at the 21st plenary 
session of the Sixth Party Central Committee. 
  At the same time, we should give precedence to the coal 
industry, electric power industry, and railway transport -- the 
priority sector in the national economy -- and should 
continuously develop the metal industry. 
  Our party's economic strategy is a just policy put forward 
based on a deep analysis of changed circumstances and practical 
demand of socialist construction in our country, and is a 
revolutionary line for effecting a new upsurge in socialist 
construction. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: During the 
adjustment period of socialist economic construction, we should 
thoroughly implement our party's revolutionary economic 
strategy. Thus, we will firmly consolidate the foundation of the 
nation's self-supporting economy and will more satisfactorily 
ensure the people's living according to the demand of socialism. 
We will hold a new position of attack to attain the higher goal 
of socialism. 
  Our party's economic strategy will, above all, enable us to 
consolidate rock-firm the foundation of the nation's 
self-supporting economy. 
  We registered a great advance in the development of the 
national economy during the Third Seven-Year Plan period. We 
further consolidated our nation's economy to be a socialist 
self-supporting national economy in which all domains, including 
industry and rural economy, were armed with modern equipment and 
which have sufficient segmental structure [pumun kujo]. 
  The party's revolutionary economic strategy has elucidated 
ways for strengthening self-reliance and the might of our 
economy in every way while consolidating our achievements. 
  During the adjustment period of socialist economic 
construction, we will further perfect segmental structure so 
that the self- reliance of the nation's economy will be 
strengthened. 
  In particular, we will continuously direct efforts to the 
coal industry, electricity, and railway transport -- the 
priority fields in the national economy -- and will more 
satisfactorily resolve the problems of fuel, energy, and 
transport. By implementing the revolutionary economic strategy, 
we will be able to epochally develop our economy by depending on 
the unbounded potential of our self-supporting economy and on 
abundant natural resources. We will more vigorously accelerate 
economic construction without wavering in the face of an 
economic blockade by the imperialists and the worldwide economic 
crisis. 
  Another economic strategy of our party is to more smoothly 
guarantee the people's living standard in accordance with the 
socialist demand. Endlessly enhancing the people's living 
standard is the supreme principle of our party's activities. 
During the recent years, our party took great interest in 
enhancing the people's living standard even under the difficult 
condition of carrying out the acute political and military 
confrontation with the imperialists. 
  Our party's revolutionary economic strategy is anticipating 
that the state investment will be increased in the agricultural, 
light industrial, and foreign trade sectors, which are directly 
related to the people's living, and that development in these 
sectors will be vigorously accelerated. Therefore, if this 
strategic policy is embodied, our people's century-old desire of 
everyone eating rice and meat soup, wearing silk clothes, and 
living in tile-roofed houses will be brilliantly realized, and 
our people's material and cultural life will be all the more 
abundant in accordance with the intrinsic demand of socialism. 
  As such, our party's revolutionary economic strategy makes 
it 
possible to more vigorously accelerate socialist construction by 
consolidating, like bedrock, the country's self-supporting 
economic basis and more smoothly guaranteeing the people's 
living standard in accordance with the socialist demand. 
  The superiority of socialism of our own style will be more 
vigorously displayed when thoroughly implementing our party's 
revolutionary economic strategy, and we will also occupy a new 
offensive camp to possess a higher ground of socialism. 
  Today we are faced with the task of highly upholding the 
military task presented by the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song's New Year address and of thoroughly implementing our 
party's revolutionary economic strategy. 
  This year is a significant year marking the passing of 30 
years since the socialist rural theses was announced. We must 
first of all vigorously carry out the struggle to complete the 
historical task of the agricultural theses so that a new turning 
point can be achieved in the development of the rural economy. 
To achieve this, irrigation and electrification work must be 
consolidated in the farms, mechanization and chemicalization 
must be realized at a high level, and the chuche farming method 
must be thoroughly implemented so that all sectors of 
agricultural production, including food grain crop can be 
further developed. 
  Next, the light industry revolution must be vigorously 
accelerated so that a great innovation can be achieved in the 
production of mass consumption goods. To achieve this, the 
light industry plants must be put in good order, reinforced, 
modernized, and active measures must be established to 
strengthen the production of raw materials of the light 
industry, including synthetic fiber and synthetic resins so that 
all the light industry plants will operate at full capacity and 
normalize production at a high level. Along with this, various 
mass consumption goods must be produced at a large scale in all 
sectors and units, the variety of consumer goods must be 
increased, and their quality must be decisively enhanced. 
  Also, foreign trade must be developed to thoroughly 
implement 
our party's revolutionary economic strategy. To develop foreign 
trade in accordance with the changed environment, foreign 
markets must be actively sought and thoroughly maintain good 
credit. 
  The production bases of export products must be firmly 
consolidated in various sectors of the people's economy, the 
production of export products must be increased, and their 
quality must be enhanced. Along with this, the source of 
exports must be actively investigated and mobilized in all 
sectors and regions so exports can be increased and processing 
trade can be developed. 
  Efforts must be put into the coal industry, electric 
industry, and the metal industry to develop agriculture and the 
light industry and vigorously accelerate the country's overall 
economic construction. Also, rail transportation must be 
carried out more smoothly. 
  All the functionaries, party members, and workers must 
highly 
uphold the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year address 
and thoroughly implement our party's revolutionary economic 
strategy so that socialist construction can be more vigorously 
accelerated.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Complete Implementation of the </F>
Agriculture-Is-First Policy Is an Important Demand in Realizing 
Our Party's Revolutionary Economic Strategy"] 
  [Text] In his New Year's address, the great leader Comrade 
Kim Il-song explained the need to completely implement our 
party's revolutionary economic strategy and stressed that we 
should make a new turning point in developing our rural economy 
this year by adhering to the agriculture-is-first policy. 
  Our party's revolutionary economic strategy is a 
revolutionary policy of economic construction that reflects our 
party's intent to enhance the superiority of socialism of our 
own style by effecting a new upsurge in economic construction 
and to consolidate the national economic power by further 
strengthening our economic independence and self-reliance. 
  The implementation of the agriculture-is-first policy is the 
most important demand in realizing our party's economic strategy. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught: This year is 
meaningful because it is when the 30th anniversary of the 
presentation of the socialist rural theses is marked. We should 
make a new turning point in developing our rural economy by 
vigorously carrying out the struggle to accomplish the historic 
tasks of the rural theses. 
  The year 1994 is a meaningful one in which the 30th 
anniversary of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's 
presentation of the socialist rural theses is marked. 
  Our people have stoutly carried out the struggle to 
implement 
the socialist rural theses under the wise leadership of the 
party and the leader. By vigorously advancing along the road 
presented in the rural theses, our people have been able to 
correctly solve the socialist rural problems without a slightest 
deviation and an improvement close to a complete realization 
[wanjonhan silhyone kajang kakkaun kaesone chopkun] of the rural 
theses is drawing near today. 
  Thus, the rural areas of our country have turned into 
socialist, cultural rural areas with good living and working 
conditions, and increasing agricultural production has made it 
possible to solve the people's food problems more smoothly. 
  With this great result we have already achieved, we should 
vigorously carry out the struggle to accomplish the historic 
tasks of the rural theses this year, when the 30th anniversary 
of its presentation is marked, and completely implement our 
party's revolutionary economic strategy. 
  Complete implementation of the agriculture-is-first policy 
is 
considered to be an important demand in realizing our party's 
revolutionary economic strategy because it enables us to greatly 
enhance the superiority of socialism of our own style by 
improving our people's living conditions. 
  Food problems are the most imminent in the people's material 
life, and how to solve the problems is one of the important 
questions that influence the result of socialist, communist 
construction. 
  With our party's people-oriented policy to smoothly solve 
the 
people's food problems, our country supplies sufficient food to 
our people, who enjoy happy lives without food problems [mogul 
kokchongul morugo]. 
  The people, however, demand more and more abundant living as 
their living conditions improve. When we do farming well by 
implementing the party's agriculture-is-first policy, we can 
meet the people's ever-increasing demand and can ultimately 
guarantee the people's happy lives in accordance with the 
socialist demand. 
  In particular, the thorough implementation of the 
agriculture-is-first policy is an important demand in fully 
displaying the superiority of socialism of our own style. The 
true superiority of socialism can be displayed in various fields 
of social life, but it can be shown practically in the people's 
happy, abundant, and material lives. 
  Without properly solving the people's food problems, we can 
neither talk about the true superiority of the socialist system 
nor firmly keep it against the enemies's various offensives and 
denouncements. To highly display the superiority of the 
socialist system of our own style, we must therefore achieve a 
century-old desire of our people who want to eat rice and meat 
soup, wear silk clothes, and live in tile-roofed homes. 
  When we thoroughly implement the agriculture-is-first 
policy, 
we can have the people eat plenty of rice and meat soup as well 
as lead them to constantly raise their standard of living. As a 
result, we can highly display the superiority of the socialist 
system. 
  The thorough implementation of the agriculture-is-first 
policy is regarded as an important demand in carrying out our 
party's revolutionary economic strategy. This is because we can 
strongly solidify the country's economic might by strengthening 
the chuche character and self-reliance of the economy. 
  As are cases in all other sectors, we cannot achieve the 
self- reliant economy when we depend on other countries 
regarding food problems. 
  Food problems are very important and essential to the 
people's material lives. In the people's material lives, 
starvation is the most difficult to put up with. Therefore, 
solving the food problems of the people is very important in 
strengthening the self-reliant economy. 
  Also, agriculture provides various raw materials to the 
light 
industry to strengthen its self-reliance and to satisfy the 
demands of workers for various industrial products. When people 
have many things to eat, including rice and meat, their 
consciousness can become much better and everything will be 
fine. As a result, they can vigorously accelerate the socialist 
economic construction. 
  To thoroughly implement our party's agriculture-is-first 
policy, we must successfully promote electricity and irrigation 
in rural communities and adequately introduce machines and 
chemicals. Also, we must further develop all sectors of 
agriculture, including grain production, by thoroughly 
implementing the chuche farming method. 
  Our working class must produce more modern agricultural 
machines, including tractors and automobiles, and various 
farming chemicals, such as chemical fertilizers and agricultural 
chemicals, and supply them to rural communities. 
  Farmers of cooperative farms and agricultural working people 
throughout the country must assiduously carry out all 
agricultural works in a position of being befitting to masters 
responsible for the nation's rice granaries. As a result, they 
must surely reach this year's grain production goal put forward 
by the party.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 12 (KCNA) -- A great upswing has 
been noticed in production in different domains of the national 
economy of Korea in the new year. 
  The Musan mining complex, a major iron headings producer of 
the nation, set itself the goal of producing 1.5 million more 
tons of iron headings this year than last year and has 
overfulfilled daily quotas since the beginning of the new year. 
  The Songjin steel complex topped the first-day's assignments 
of the new year 3.4 percent in steel and 5.1 percent in rolled 
steel. It has since kept a high and steady rate of production. 
  Coal mines in North Hamgyong Province has lifted the daily 
amount of tunneling and coal output more than 20 percent by 
introducing a rational coal cutting method. The Sunchon and 
Anju district coal mining complexes also have overfulfilled 
their daily assignments on all indices since the beginning of 
the year. 
  The east Pyongyang thermal power station generates 80 
percent 
more electricity and produces 2.4 times more hot water for 
central heating on a daily average this year than at the end of 
last year. 
  At the Kaesong textile mill, the daily output of fabrics is 
40 percent up and that of yarn 30 percent up on the daily 
average of last year.

  [Text] The Japanese YOMIURI SHIMBUN reported on 13 January 
that North Korea is planning to merge North Hamgyong Province's 
Najin city and Sonbong County, which are close to the border 
with the PRC and Russia, and upgrade the region to a city 
directly controlled by the central government as part of its 
plan to begin full-scale work for the partial opening of its 
economy, including the construction of ports. 
  Quoting a related Seoul source, the YOMIURI SHIMBUN pointed 
out that the move to merge Najin and Sonbong is thought to 
symbolize North Korea's strategy to ease the economic 
difficulties it faces by partially opening its economy. 
  The Najin and Sonbong region is the core region of the Tumen 
River Development Plan launched by the UN Development Program. 
In December 1991, North Korea named the region a "free economic 
and trade zone," North Korea's equivalent to a special economic 
zone.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Pak Ui-chun on the research report, </F>
"Analysis of Negotiation Style and Activity in the Era Moving 
Away from the Cold War," by the Foreign Ministry-affiliated 
Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security; first three 
paragraphs are introduction] 
  [Text] Since North Korea withdraw from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) in March last year, North Korea 
has held talks and behind-the-scenes negotiations with the 
United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
over the nuclear issue, thus playing a steady tug-of-war with 
them. 
  Through several rounds of North-South dialogue, including 
the 
North-South high-level talks, North Korea's negotiation style 
toward the South was revealed. However, North Korea's 
negotiation style over the nuclear issue, which is compared to a 
"long-distance race," has not been nearly revealed. 
  In this connection, in a recent research report, "The 
Analysis of the Negotiation Style and Activity in the Era Moving 
Away From the Cold War," the Institute of Foreign Affairs and 
National Security analyzed that "North Korea's external 
negotiation capacity on the nuclear issue is compared both to 
`the style of Zhuge Kongming' and to `an acrobat dancing on the 
rope for the first time.'" According to the analysis, North 
Korea's diplomatic style concerning the nuclear issue is as 
follows: 
  Regarding the international trends as a "struggle between 
socialist and imperialist power," North Korea has recognized 
external negotiations as a means for realizing socialist 
ideology and smashing the imperialist forces. 
  Regarding its purpose as an absolute line, North Korea does 
not hesitate to employ any means and method to attain its 
purpose of external negotiations. 
  North Korea's basic consciousness about external 
negotiations 
is mainly affected by a way of thinking which seeks a socialist 
equality, the characteristics of the closed Kim Il-song system 
based on the chuche idea, independence, and the patriarchal 
Confucian culture obedient to the supreme authority. As a 
result, North Korea's diplomatic negotiation style has an aspect 
different from the Western style of diplomatic negotiations. 
  In particular, because North Korea has the historical 
experiences of being plagued by neighboring powerful countries 
for a long time, it distrusts external forces. On the other 
hand, it has the consciousness to take advantage of foreign 
forces. 
  As to the nuclear issue, which has a complex and technical 
aspect compared with other general negotiations which were 
handled during the North-South high-level talks, the 
characteristics of North Korea's diplomatic negotiation style 
and activity are as follows: 
<H5>  The Consciousness as a Means for Resisting Foreign Forces </H5>
  North Korea adheres to attaining the target of its 
negotiations. North Korea has steadily demanded that U.S. 
nuclear weapons be withdrawn from South Korea, that U.S. nuclear 
threat against North Korea be removed, that the Team Spirit 
exercise be discontinued, that the U.S. nuclear umbrella for 
South Korea be removed, and that U.S.-North Korean direct 
negotiations be held. 
  North Korea has repeatedly put forward such conditions. 
Prior to adopting the denuclearization declaration, through the 
government's official statements, mass communications, and 
various conferences, North Korea has repeatedly declared that 
without the withdrawal of U.S. nuclear weapons and the removal 
of nuclear threat against North Korea, it could not conclude the 
nuclear safeguards accord with the IAEA. North Korea has 
created the atmosphere that if the preconditions are not met, it 
cannot respond to nuclear negotiations and nuclear inspections. 
  In the long run, North Korea responded to North-South 
nuclear negotiations correctly after former U.S. President Bush 
took steps to remove tactical nuclear weapons and former ROK 
President No Tae-u announced the nonexistence of nuclear weapons 
in South Korea. 
  North Korea does not seem to prepare in advance to 
specifically implement details agreed upon by the North and 
South. In early December 1991, North Korea agreed to start 
nuclear negotiations during the North-South high-level talks 
and, just within 20 days after this agreement, it agreed on the 
principles put forward by the South. These principles included 
"denuclearization on the Korean peninsula" and "the start of the 
inspections in June after formulating regulations in May." In 
the stage of nearly carrying out this agreement, North Korea 
refused to discuss the regulations of the nuclear inspections, 
but instead maintained that the root of the nuclear issue is due 
to South Korea's introduction of U.S. nuclear weapons. Under 
this pretext, it has deadlocked a meeting of the Joint Nuclear 
Control Committee for a long time. This is a good example 
showing that North Korea does not prepare in advance to 
implement agreements between the North and South. 
  North Korea makes efforts to obtain its target for 
negotiations by presenting additional proposals to South Korea. 
When we accepted all conditions made by North Korea in December 
1991 regarding the IAEA's request for inspection, North Korea 
put forward the simultaneous inspection of North and South Korea 
as a new condition for accepting IAEA inspections. When we 
accepted the simultaneous inspection of the North and South, 
North Korea called again for the "adoption of an agreement for 
the implementation of inspection" featuring the logic of 
converting the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free zone after 
the North and South forge a denuclearization declaration. Also, 
it has delayed discussing the inspection regulations. 
  North Korea regards propaganda as important in negotiations. 
Before entering negotiations, North Korea has created 
international opinion by conducting a political propaganda that 
the fundamental root is caused by U.S. nuclear weapons deployed 
in South Korea and it is being threatened by U.S. nuclear 
weapons, and by holding the "international conferences for peace 
and denuclearization on the Korean peninsula." 
<H5>  A Threat With an Extreme Diplomacy </H5>
  North Korea invites famous foreign figures who can speak for 
its position in the process of negotiations. By using them, it 
tries to dispel the suspicion of its nuclear development and 
obtains information from them regarding the other party. Also, 
it uses them as a way to grasp the limit that the other party 
can compromise and, at the same time, to strengthen its demands. 
  High-ranking North Korean military officials show, however, 
that they are still reluctant to meet foreign figures. As a 
result, officials of the State Administration and the party can 
mainly deal with them. Foreign figures who are believed to be 
highly useful for propaganda works are be selected as to meet 
with Kim Il-song. 
  In addition, in the course of nuclear negotiations with the 
United States, North Korea has shown its strategies, such as "a 
threat of extreme diplomacy, the change of agenda items in 
negotiations by presenting either new conditions or proposals, 
and the presentation of uncompromising demands." 
  Through an extreme step of the so-called declaration to 
withdraw from the NPT, North Korea has escaped from the pressure 
to accept special inspection [tukpyol sachal] from the IAEA for 
the time being and led the United States to regard the issue of 
making North Korea remain in the NPT as a more important agenda 
than the IAEA inspection issue in the negotiations. As a 
result, North Korea has come to hold its long-wished-for direct 
negotiations with the United States. 
  In North Korean-U.S. negotiations, particularly, North Korea 
has strongly called for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from South 
Korea and for the establishment of diplomatic relations with the 
United States, while the United States has demanded that North 
Korea remain in the NPT. It is the current situation that the 
United States, by presenting irresistible demands, checks North 
Korea's will concerning nuclear inspections.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Order of Power As Means 
of Systemic Perpetuation 
  Naturally, the changes in order of political power in North 
Korea do not make up the forecast chart of probability with 
absolute certainty. There are instances in which someone once 
dropped from the order yet was not completely eliminated from 
the system. Because some of those once dropped had been 
reinstated after a certain period, although there had been 
others who were totally eliminated once and for all. 
  An example of this is the case in which Im Chun-chu and 
others had been purged at the (Pyorori Meeting) in December 
1950, in the midst of the Korean War; the party Central 
Committee accused him, by name, of being a traitor charging that 
he `retreated abandoning the party leadership, the party members 
and the people all together.' However, Im Chun-chu was saved 
and reinstated as he promoted idolization of Kim Il-song as the 
`The Sunshine of Human Race,' and `The Matchless Great Man.' 
  Not only that, he was the main architect of Kim Il-song 
dynasty as the foremost political ideologue and theorist with 
regard to the system of political succession and secured himself 
a position as a sort of chief of staff for Kim Chong-il faction. 
  Another example is O Chin-u, firmly in the third position of 
the political order following Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il. 
  He worked for Kim Il-song since the partisan days and was 
quite a bit junior to Kim Il and Choe Hyon as a party cadre and 
was merely a reginmental commander during the Korean War, but 
since then he solidified his political power base in the 
military, having sided with the group in power at a given point 
in time during every change of the North Korean political power 
structure with the reputation as an outstanding strategist and 
purger of adversaries. And he keeps his position today by the 
same method, once again as the chieftain for sustenance/security 
of the Kim Chong-il order. [passage omitted] 
  There has been little change even after the 6th Party 
Congress (October 1980) which was the turning point for Kim 
Chong-il's ascension as the official successor and the only 
change that came out of the Congress in the characteristics and 
the order of political structure was the shift in its direction 
toward solidification of the Kim Chong-il order. 
<H5>  Mass Promotion of Kim Chong-il Faction </H5>
  This was clearly observed in the substantial changes in the 
list of candidates for delegate to the Congress where anti-Kim 
Chong-il personnel were demoted or dropped all together and the 
noticeable promotion of Kim Chong-il supporters took place. 
  Colonel General Kim Chol-man, in charge of special military 
operations on South Korea, was dropped as a Political Bureau 
candidate member and Kye Ung-tae dropped to candidate- from full 
member which in turn dropped his ranking dramatically to 27th 
from 16th. Vice Premier Kang Hui-won, whose ranking rapidly rose 
to 32nd from 75th, was newly added to the Political Burau as a 
candidate member, increasing the number of candidate members to 
16. 
  Some other examples: Pak Su-tong, the secretary in charge of 
labor organizations and the director of the party organizational 
guidance department, and Hong Si-hak, the secretary in charge of 
economy, were discharged from their positions, while Hyon 
Mu-kwang, a Political Bureau candidate member, rose to 20th from 
31st. Hyon Mu-kwang, a deputy premier and the chairman of the 
Agriculture Committee, rose to 37th from 38th. Ho Chong-suk, the 
chief of the Secretriat Bureau of the Democratic Front for the 
Reunification of the Fatherland, rose to 36th from 54th while 
being newly appointed as a party secretary. This increased the 
number of party secretaries to 11. 
  The WPK eighth session of the 5th plenum held February 11 to 
13, 1974 secretly selected Kim Chong-il as a member of the WPK 
Political Committee and, during the period (1974-78), some 
figures such as Kim Tong-kyu (deputy director), Yu Chang-sik 
(party Political Committee candidate member and secretary), Kim 
Chung-nim (party secretary), Yi Yong-mu (Chief of the General 
Military Political Bureau), Kim Chol-man (First Deputy Chief of 
the General Staff), Kim Ik-hyon (Minister of the People's Armed 
Forces), Pak Su-tong (Director of party Organizational 
Department), and Han Ik-su (Political Committee member and 
secretary) had either disappeared or been ignored for a time. 
  Although some of them had been back in the party high 
ranking 
positions, others such as Kim Tong-kyu, Yu Chang-sik, and Chang 
Chong-hang (Deputy Minister of People's Armed Forces) had 
completely disappeared from the stage of political power. 
  These occurrences were the series of events the party 
political establishment carried out to sustain Kim Chong-il 
succession order and indicate that the nucleus of the party 
political power now consists of the partisan veterans, major 
general level personnel of the partisan origin, and the second 
generation of partisans. 
<H5>  Kim Chong-il Leads Political Power Pack </H5>
  During the period, the core of North Korea's power structure 
consisted of partisan veterans such as Kim Il (Premier, 
deceased), Choe Yong-kon (Deputy President, deceased) O 
Paek-yong (Commander of Red Worker-Peasant Militia, deceased), 
Kim Tong-kyu (Political Committee member, fate unknown), So Chol 
(party Inspection Committee Chairman, deceased), Im Chun-chu 
(Political Committee member, deceased) and O Chin-u (People's 
Army Chief of the General Staff, Political Bureau Standing 
Committee member and Minister of People's Armed Forces), and the 
major general level personnel of partisan origin such as Chon 
Mun-sop (commander of Security Guards and National Inspection 
Committee Chairman), Paek Hang-nim (Deputy Minister of Public 
Security, Minister of Public Security and a vice marshal), Yi 
Tu-ik (commanding general of First Army, party Military 
Committee member and a vice marshal), Chu To-il (commander of 
Army Group, commander of Pyongyang Defense Forces and a vice 
marshal), and Cho Myong-nok (Commander of Air Force and a 
general) and others such as So Yun-sok, Kim kuk-tae, Yi 
Chang-son, Choe Tae-pok, Chon Kum-son, Chon Pyong-ho, Choe 
Yong-nim and Han Song-nyong. 
  The order of North Korea's political structure is revealed 
primarily in the official reports listing the names, in the 
order of importance, seated at the speakers' platform during an 
entire party congress or major national celebrations such as 
anniversaries of the regime and the party and also the names of 
attendants such as anniveraries of the regime and the party and 
also the names of attendants to the funeral of a high ranking 
cadre. 
  As of last year's 44th anniversary of the North Korean 
regime, the party Political Bureau had 13 full members, reduced 
from 14 due to the death of So Chol and 8 candidate members and, 
thus, a total of 24 members, who make up the nucleus of 
political power. 
  Among them, three Political Bureau Standing Committee 
members, Kim Il-song, Kim Chong-il and O Chin-u, make up the 
core within the nucleus of political power. 
  There has been no change in the positions of those three 
which were fixed at the 6th Party Congress in 1980. 
  Excepting those three and, thus, the fourth position on 
down, 
there have been some up's and down's; the current order being 
Deputy President Yi Chong-ok 4th, Deputy President Pak Song-chol 
5th, Yon Hyong-muk (Premier of the Administration Council) 6th, 
Kim Yong-nam (Minister of Foreign Affairs) 7th, Choe Kwang 
(armed forces Chief of the General Staff) 8th, Kye Ung-tae 
(party secretary) 9th, Chon Pyong-ho (party secretary) 10th, Han 
Song-yong (party secretary) 11th, So Yun-sok 12th and Kang 
Song-san 13th positions. 
  Among them, Yon Hyong-muk once rose to the 4th position 
during the 43rd anniversary ceremony in September of 1991 but 
fell back to his original 6th position in 1992. Except for Yon 
Hyong-muk's moves, there has been no change in the order through 
the 7th position held by Kim Yong-nam. 
  Choe Kwang, purged in 1969 and resurrected in 1977 and 
became 
the Armed Forces Chief of the General Staff in 1988, together 
with some others such as Kye Ung-tae, Han Song-yong and Chon 
Pyong-ho has experienced changes now and then, though not 
extensive, in his ranking within the order. 
<H3>  No Changes in Political Power Structure Expected Unitl 7th 
Party Congress </H3>
  So Yun-sok and Kang Song-san alternately held the last 
position among the Political Bureau full members but, then, So 
Yun-sok rose one notch up to the 12th position. Yet, there has 
been no change in the May 1990 roster except the omissions of Ho 
Tam who died in May of 1991 and So Chol who died in September 
[of the same year]. 
  In view of the fact, particularly, that Kye Ung-tae, Chon 
Pyong-ho and Han Song-yong, all of whom are considered the core 
personnel of Kim Chong-il order are dual-hatted as party 
secretaries in addition to being Political Bureau members, it 
seems the political power structure is being firmed up for the 
Kim Chong-il succession order. 
  This observation is further supported by the fact that, as 
the Political Bureau Standing Committee decides on the ranking 
and the changes of political power structure order, Kim 
Chong-il, the Secretary in Charge of Organization, rather than 
Kim Il-song is currently taking the leading role, and that there 
has been no purge and have only been minor changes which were 
due not to any compelling reasons but to accommodate various 
factions such as partisans, party officials and government 
bureaucrats, which was strongly indicated as characteristic of 
the changes, and that there has been little change in the 
Political Bureau candidate membership from the political power 
structure of May 1990, except the omissions of Hyon Mu-Kwang who 
died in February of this year and Cho Se-ung who disappeared 
from the roster having been discharged from the position of 
Responsible Secretary of the party for North Pyongan Province. 
  Of course, the 20th session of the 6th plenum of the party 
Central Committee held in December 1992 saw the discharge of Yon 
Hyong-muk from the position of Premier of the Administration 
Council and the promotion of Kang Song-san, who was the 
responsible Secretary of the party and the Chairman of People's 
Committee for North Hamgyong Province, as his successor, having 
elected Kim Tal-hyon (Deputy Premier and Chairman of External 
Economic Affairs Committee), and Kim Yong-sun, a party 
secretary, to Political Bureau candidate members, and having 
selected Kim Kuk-tae (Superintendent of Kim Il-song Advanced 
Academy of the party) and Kim Ki-nam (Director of Propaganda and 
Agitation Department) as party secretaries. 
  Also nine candidate members such as Choe Pong-man (party 
Central Committee candidate member) and Chang Song-taek 
(Director of Youth Work Department) have been elevated to 
Central Committee membership and nine such as Pak Myong-chol 
(Chairman of National Athletic Committee) have been elected to 
candidate membership. 
  Kang Song-san, who grew up within the party system since the 
late 60s and is a Russian expert and an economics specialist and 
for North-South relations, is considered more conservative than 
Yon Hyong-muk. His promotion indicates that Kim Chong-il is 
concerned about economic reforms and North-South relations. 
  This year's speakers' platform for the (Central Report 
Congress) for the 45th anniversary of the North Korean regime 
consisted of, in addition to Kim Il-song, Kim Chong-il and O 
Chin-u, Kang Song-san (Premier of the Administration Council) as 
the 4th ranking, and, in the order, Pak Song-chol (Deputy 
President), Kim Yong-nam (Deputy Premier and Minister of Foreign 
Affairs), Choe Tae-pok (party secretary), Kim Yong-sun (party 
secretary), Choe Yong-nim (Deputy Premier), Hong Song-nam, Kang 
Hui-won, Kim Tal-hyon (all Deputy Premier), Kim Chung-nim (party 
secretary, Yun Ki-pok, So Kwan-hui, Hwang Chang-hwa, Pak Nam-ki 
(all party secretaries), Yong Hyong-sop (Chairman of the Supreme 
People's Assembly), and Chon Mun-sop (Chairman of National 
Inspection Committee). 
  There appears to be little change in the fundamental 
composition of the political power structure, even though minor 
cosmetic changes were observed, and most of them are younger 
generation of the revolution who are close to Kim Chong-il and 
foreign educated pragmatists or technocrats who have strong 
minds of their own. 
  According to our analysis, it appears that there would be 
fundamentally few effectuating and epochal changes on the 
current North Korean political power structure up until the 7th 
Party Congress even though there might be some cosmetic ones 
such as the case of Yon Hyong-muk for an immediate problem at 
hand, in view of the fact that the change surrounding Yon 
Hyong-muk in December of last year, changing his status from a 
member of Political Bureau to a candidate member and 
transferring him from premiership to the (Responsible Secretary 
of the party and the Chairman of People's Committee for Chakang 
Province), was due to the determinant fact that he was a Kim 
Il-song's man.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 13 (YONHAP) -- The National Unification 
Board (NUB) said Thursday it has given the Korean National 
Council of Churches (KNCC) permission to contact North Korean 
citizens but has made no decision on allowing KNCC to invite 
North Korean Christian leaders to visit South Korea. 
  "Our approval is limited to an exchange of letters or a 
meeting in a third country to find out if North Korean leaders 
are willing to visit Seoul, and does not extend to their actual 
visit," an NUB official said. 
  If Pyongyang shows it is sincere about settling the nuclear 
problem, Seoul is said to be willing to seriously consider 
allowing North Korean Church leaders to visit the South. 
  KNCC applied for a permit to contact North Koreans to invite 
church leaders from the communist country to attend its general 
assembly on Feb. 21 and various religious events.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 13 (YONHAP) -- Another group of 19 
Chinese tourists, presumably all ethnic Koreans, fled their 
hotel in Seoul on Jan. 7 apparently to find jobs in the country, 
it was learned on Thursday. 
  This was seventh of such escapes involving 187 tourists from 
China since last September. 
  In the first and largest group escape, 115 Chinese 
participating in a group tour organized by the Aju Travel Co. 
fled their hotel in group on Sept. 6 last year. 
  Of the 187 who had fled, only 29 were caught in Suwon and 
forcibly flown back to China, with the whereabouts of the 
remainders having been unknown. 
  A police source said the latest 19 escapees were part of the 
24 Chinese of a group tour organized by the Tongbo Travel Co. in 
the Jilin Province, part of the ethnic Koreans' autonomous area 
in northeastern China. 
  The remaining five of the group were deported on two 
occasions by Tuesday. 
  After group escapes by Korean-Chinese were reported often 
late last year, the government has been controlling group visits 
by ethnic Koreans from China. 
  In the latest case, the 24 visitors produced passports that 
described them as ethnic Chinese and spoke Chinese only. 
  Immigration officials suspect they were in effect ethnic 
Koreans who somehow forged their papers to make themselves 
appear to be ethnic Chinese so as to get entry into Korea.

  [Text] New Russian Ambassador Georgy Kunadze met with 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu for half an hour yesterday [12 
January] to give him a copy of the letter of credentials he will 
formally present to President Kim Yong-sam later. 
  Kunadze is no stranger to Han as the two have met several 
times as researcher and professor at academic conferences while 
the former was serving at the IMEMO (Institute of World Economy 
and International Relations). 
  He expressed a hope to learn the Korean language during 
talks 
with Minister Han, according to a ministry official who was 
present at the meeting. Majoring in Japanese at Moscow 
University, Kunadze is a fluent Japanese speaker. 
  The Russian envoy was quoted as saying that his government 
plans to send more diplomats to Seoul, adding that the Russian 
embassy is a little small. Touching on his official residence 
south of Mt. Namsan, he also said that the house is good as 
living quarters but small for social functions, as if suggesting 
early settlement of the ownership of the former Russian legation 
site in downtown Seoul, according to the ministry official. 
  Former ambassador Alexander Panov has started working as 
vice 
foreign minister in charge of Asia-Pacific affairs covering 
Korea, China, Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand, Kunadze 
was quoted as saying. 
  While serving as vice minister, Kunadze was responsible for 
personnel and administration affairs in addition to Asia-Pacific 
and southwest Asian affairs. 
  He also met with Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong for 
about 35 minutes. Vice Minister Hong had served as ambassador 
to Moscow for one year before he became vice minister last March. 
  He is expected to present the letter of credentials to 
President Kim late this month or early next month along with 
three other new ambassadors, the ministry official said.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 13 (YONHAP) -- The Agency for National 
Security Planning (NSP), once a secretive intelligence 
organization, is trying to readjust its role and function to 
keep abreast of the country's efforts for openness and 
internationalization. 
  The immediate reason for the change is a recent revision of 
the law governing the Agency, curtailing its right to 
investigate cases involving anti-communist activities and 
establishing a watchdog committee in the National Assembly. 
  But the Agency appears to have realized that it has reached 
the point where it has to switch from the practice of 
supervising domestic politics to boosting the nation's 
competitive power by gathering information overseas. 
  In other words, the Agency has to internationalize itself if 
it is to serve the nation in the world arena. 
  Director Kim Tok set the goal for the Agency in his New 
Year's message: "Let's become an international intelligence 
organization in tune with the general trend for 
internationalization." 
  Accordingly, the Agency is now in the middle of the 
processes 
to strengthen the functions of collecting information, 
especially on business in foreign countries, after abolishing 
the department that was in charge of political affairs. 
  Kim Tok specifically prohibited NSP agents from meddling in 
domestic politics. 
  The Agency is also training its officials to specialize in 
various fields while stepping up foreign language education for 
its agents. It has already began sending NSP officials abroad 
for one- year study of language and political and social 
backgrounds of a country they are to be assigned to later. 
  The NSP is also encouraging officials to develop 
associations 
with Korean businessmen and intelligence agents of their 
assigned countries, sources say. 
  Moreover, the Agency made the use of computers a requirement 
for all agents and the ability to use a computer is a must for 
promotion. 
  In addition, the NSP is working out measures to handle the 
"enormous amount" of information being collected by vast 
networks of Korean big businesses operating overseas and to 
prevent foreigners from siphoning off Korea's own economic 
information for foreign interests. 
  The Agency is also faced with the necessity of strengthening 
its department in charge of affairs related to the National 
Assembly since it no longer is be able to take advantage of the 
confidentiality of Agency work under the revised law on the NSP. 
  What irks the Agency more than anything else in the passage 
of the revised law is the abolition of the Agency's right to 
investigate persons accused of not informing the authorities of 
communist activities despite their knowledge or those who praise 
the North Korean political system. 
  Initially, there was "some opposition" in the agency when 
those rights were abolished, but most NSP officials have now 
accepted the revision as part of "unavoidable" action on the 
part of the civilian government of President Kim Yong-sam, 
sources say. 
  Under the revised law, the Agency is barred from auditing 
the 
security matters of every government agency. It has also lost 
the right to "coordinate business" of other governmental 
agencies. As a result, it is faced with shifting some personnel 
in charge of those affairs elsewhere.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 13 (YONHAP) -- The Defense Ministry has 
lost a classified document that it sent to Rep. Cho Sun-hwan of 
the United People's Party during the National Assembly's regular 
session last year, and is trying to find it. 
  Investigators from the Defense Security Command searched the 
homes of Rep. Cho's aides -- Yi Un-chae, 38, and Chong Chu-hun, 
31 -- for the "secret" paper Thursday but came up empty handed, 
a ministry spokesman said. 
  The document contains details of the operating budget for 
the 
ministry for 1994 and could benefit Korea's enemies, he said. 
  The ministry prepared the document in September and, through 
the National Assembly Secretariat, gave a copy to each member of 
the defense and the budget and accounts committees for their 
deliberations on the defense budget. The copy sent to Cho, a 
member of the budget and accounts committee, was not returned. 
  Pressed for its return, the secretariat told the ministry in 
a letter Jan. 3 that it had no way of finding the document 
because the aide who had kept it had been fired. 
  In January 1992, Hwang In-o, the leader of a North Korean 
spy 
ring, obtained a classified Defense Ministry document through Yi 
Kun-hui, a lawmaker's secretary, and handed a photocopy to North 
Korea through Japan.

  [Text] Despite poor domestic sales, the nation's machinery 
industry saw its exports exceed the $20 billion mark last year. 
  Prospects for the machinery sector this year are brighter as 
a strong recovery in domestic demand and sustained exports are 
expected. 
  Domestic demand for machinery, excluding electronics and 
shipbuilding, edged down 0.7 percent to $84.4 billion in 1993 
from a year ago, but overseas shipments surged 21.8 percent to 
$20.6 billion. 
  The rise in exports increased the ratio of overseas 
shipments 
to total demand for machinery to 25.7 percent, up from 22 
percent in 1992. 
  The Korea Association of Machinery Industry (KOAMI) 
attributed the surge in exports to the nation's efforts to 
diversity the machinery market. 
  China and other developing countries in Southeast and 
Southwest Asia have emerged as the nation's new export markets 
for Korea's machinery items following the United States. 
  Korea's import sources have shifted from Japan to Germany, 
Italy and other European Community countries. 
  Machinery production in 1993 was estimated to have grown to 
$80.3 billion, representing a year-on-year rise of 4.1 percent, 
but machinery imports dropped 0.3 percent to $24.7 billion last 
year. 
  The decline, mainly due to sluggish facility investments by 
domestic businesses, is the first in 11 years. Korea recorded a 
7.2 percent drop in machinery imports in 1992. 
  The KOAMI predicted that domestic sales of machinery would 
grow 11.7 percent to $94.3 billion in 1994 and exports would 
increase 19.9 percent to $24.7 billion. 
  "A good showing in domestic demand and exports would hike 
the 
ratio of overseas shipments to total demand of machinery to 27 
percent," one KOAMI official said. 
  He, however, forecast that machinery imports would jump 11.3 
percent to $27.5 billion this year. "The machinery trade 
deficit would decline from a shortfall of $4.1 billion in 1993 
to a deficit of $2.8 billion this year." 
  Korea suffered a machinery trade deficit of $7.8 billion in 
1992 and a shortfall of $9.5 billion in 1991. 
  Despite a big improvement in the machinery trade balance, 
the 
nation's trade shortfall with Japan widened to $8.1 billion last 
year, up from a deficit of $7.7 billion in 1992. The comparable 
deficit figures with Japan were $8.6 billion in 1991, $6.7 
billion in 1990 and $6.3 billion in 1989, according to data 
released by the KOAMI. 
  Machinery exports to Japan increased $100 million to $1.4 
billion, but machinery imports jumped 5.4 percent to $9.5 
billion. 
  The share of Japanese-made items in machinery imports 
increased to 38.5 percent in 1993, up from 36.6 percent in 1992, 
showing Korea's heavy dependency on Japan in machinery imports. 
  Machinery production would increase 13.9 percent to $91.5 
billion in 1994, the official forecast. 
  Of the machinery sector, the KOAMI official predicted, 
general machinery would register an export growth of 16.7 
percent to $8.4 billion in 1994, up from $7.2 billion in 1993. 
  Imports of general machinery would jump 11.2 percent to 
$14.9 
billion this year, compared with $13.4 billion in 1993. 
  General machinery accounted for about 17 percent of total 
machinery exports and about 40 percent of total machinery 
imports in 1992. 
  "Sluggish domestic facility investments last year kept the 
growth rate in production of general machinery down to a rise of 
2.1 percent to $20.4 billion from a year ago, but it is expected 
to rise 13.2 percent to $23.1 billion this year," the official 
said. 
  General machinery saw its facility investments decline 0.4 
percent to 548.4 billion won last year because of slow economic 
recovery at home. 
  Facility investments for the machinery industry overall 
stood 
at 3.88 trillion won in 1993, up 19.4 percent from the previous 
year. Transportation equipment saw facility investment jump 28.4 
percent to 2.45 trillion won last year. 
  The official also predicted that domestic demand for general 
machinery would surge 11.3 percent to $29.6 billion in 1994. 
The comparable figure for 1993 was $26.6 billion, which was 
down 5.9 percent from the previous year.

  [Text] Exiled communist leader Jose Maria Sison yesterday 
said the peace efforts between the government and the National 
Democratic Front (NDF) would be endangered if the Ramos 
government is found to be behind the murder of Victor Martinez, 
an alleged former commander of the New People's Army. 
  In a statement where he expressed his condolences to the 
family of Martinez, Sison also rejected the suggestion by a 
rebel faction opposed to him that the current leadership of the 
Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) could be behind the 
killing. He said the murder was most likely carried out by the 
government to sow "bloody intrigue" between the two conflicting 
sides within the communist movement. "There are prevalent 
indications that this killing is the deed of certain men who 
enjoy the authority and protection of the Ramos regime and who 
seek to sow intrigue against the national democratic movement," 
Sison said. 
  He warned that unless the government desists from pitting 
one 
group within the rebel movement against the other, there would 
be "absolutely no basis for any kind of talks between the Manila 
government and the NDF." Although Sison denies being the CPP 
chairman, he admits to being a consultant to the NDF in its 
current peace efforts with the Ramos administration. 
  In saying that the CPP had no hand in the murder of 
Martinez, 
Sison said the former rebel commander "was known to have served 
well the revolutionary movement and to have distanced himself 
from the group of Arturo Tabara." Tabara was one of four former 
CPP officers now facing possible trial before a "people's court" 
for various charges. The other three are Romulo Kintanar, 
Filemon Lagman and Ricardo Reyes. They have been accused of 
"serious crimes" such as gangsterism, gross malversation of 
party funds and instigation of a bloody witch hunt within the 
movement that led to the death of hundreds of suspected 
government agents. 
  Sison said Martinez was never in the list of those accused 
by 
the CPP of serious crimes. Apart from having distanced himself 
from Tabara, Sison said Martinez was subsequently suspected by 
the former of turning against his group. 
  "It is highly probable that a military and police group in 
combination with the Tabara group killed Martinez as the 
sacrificial lamb in the Ramos regime's scheme," he said. Sison 
reiterated that Tabara is known to have been a government agent 
since 1988. 
  Explaining why the CPP could not have been behind the 
killing, Sison said, even those facing charges "are not subject 
to summary execution." They are guaranteed the right to due 
process, the very same principle which they trampled upon in 
committing their crimes in torturing and killing suspects in the 
course of the anti-informer campaigns," he said. 
  Martinez was killed in front of his wife and three children 
last 2 January by men introducing themselves as government 
agents.

  [Text] A colleague of the slain former rebel leader 
Vicente Martinez yesterday accused exiled communist Jose Maria 
Sison and the military of "muddling" the circumstances 
surrounding the killing. 
  A statement from the Alex Boncayao Brigade sent to the 
INQUIRER office yesterday, meanwhile, pointed to the military as 
the "direct perpetrator" of the killing, but also held the Sison 
led faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) 
responsible for "opening the door for (the military's) bloody 
intrigue." 
  Ricardo Reyes, former secretary general of the CPP, added 
that Sison and Armed Forces Chief of Staff Lisandro Abadia are 
using the victim for "self serving purposes." 
  Sison's group was earlier implicated by Martinez's comrades 
in the underground movement in Visayas in the killing, but Sison 
reversed the accusations, saying that Martinez must have been 
killed by the communist opposition in connivance with the 
military and the police. 
  "Martinez was known to have distanced himself from the 
(opposition group)," Sison said, adding that "he (Martinez) was 
subsequently suspected by the (opposition) of turning against 
it." 
  But Reyes, who has now joined the open legal struggle 
refuted 
Sison's statements. 
  "Vic Martinez has unequivocally and steadfastly stood for 
the 
opposition," he said. "I know it because we are co-workers in 
the (Philippine Ecumenical Action for Community Empowerment 
Foundation)," he added. 
  "Sobrang kawalanghiyaan na ito [This is notoriously 
shameless]," Reyes said, describing alleged "twisting of facts." 
  In criticizing the military, Reyes said that Abadia has 
exonerated the military "with indecent haste... relying on 
something as dubious as intelligence reports." Because of this, 
he said the military's impartiality has therefore been 
compromised in the investigation. 
  Sergio Romero, ABB [Alex Boncayao Brigade] commanding 
officer, said that the "bloody intrigues" were sparked by 
Sison's group when it issued last month "charge sheets" against 
four ranking leaders in the CPP opposition who are to be tried 
in "people's courts." 
  These are Reyes, former NPA [New People's Army] chief Romulo 
Kintanar, Metro Manila CPP head Felimon Lagman and CPP Visayas 
chair Arturo Tabara. 
  The ABB called on Sison's group to "repair the damage they 
have done." Likewise, he demanded the withdrawal of the charges 
against the opposition leaders and to stop Sison's personal 
attacks against these people. 
  Meanwhile, Luis Jalandoni, vice chairman of the National 
Democratic Front (NDF), yesterday condemned the killing of 
Martinez and warned that such "bloody intrigues" would frustrate 
the peace talks. 
  "Any attempt of the Ramos regime to carry out bloody 
intrigue 
against the revolutionary movement will render impossible 
further talks between the NDF and the (government)," Jalandoni, 
who represents the NDF in the peace talks, said in a statement 
from Utrecht, The Netherlands.

  [Text] The Moro Islamic Liberation Front [MILF] is ready to 
sign an agreement with the Philippine Government for the 
implementation of separate cease fires. Government panel member 
Eduardo Ermita made this announcement after receiving hints from 
the MILF headed by Hashem Salamat. Earlier, government panel 
Chairman Manuel Yan disclosed that the government will hold 
separate peace talks with the MILF after the negotiation with 
the MNLF [Moro National Liberation Front] headed by Nur Misuari. 
  [Begin recording, in English, in progress] [Ermita] ... and 
MNLF. 
  [Unidentified reporter] But what about the cease-fire 
processes? 
  [Ermita] When we came from Jakarta, we got word that they 
[MILF] are considering signing a separate cease-fire agreement, 
but we have never been able to confirm that. 
  [Reporter] Will the cease-fire agreement depend on what took 
place during the talks with MNLF? 
  [Ermita] No, it is independent of the MNLF. We are still 
awaiting, lahat eh.... [changes thought], we have not gotten any 
final word from the MILF whether indeed they will sign a 
separate cease-fire agreement with the Philippine Government.

  [Excerpt] Zamboanga City -- A cease fire agreement between 
the government and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) 
will be signed in Cotabato City today or tomorrow, depending on 
the availability of Nur Misuari, MNLF chairman who is reportedly 
still in Jolo, Sulu. 
  The joint cease fire committee, led by Marine Brig. Gen. 
Guillermo Ruiz and Maj. Gen. Abdul Sarim of the MNLF, drew up 
the agreement after three days of meeting here last 5 to 7 
January. 
  Both panels agreed that a joint cease fire monitoring office 
will be set up here to monitor, review, and evaluate violations 
of the cease fire pact. 
  Sub-monitoring offices will be set up in the 13 provinces of 
Mindanao where the cease fire is in effect. 
  Ruiz said "the ground rules of the accord will be in effect. 
The MNLF will not be allowed to recruit fighters. It will also 
be banned from training fighters during the cease fire. MNLF 
rebels will be prohibited from carrying guns outside identified 
MNLF areas." 
  He added "there will be no acts of terrorism or violence 
while the cease fire is in effect." 
  "On the other hand, government forces will not be allowed to 
conduct military operations against MNLF rebels. There will no 
naval gunfire or shelling of pinpointed rebel areas. However, 
Philippine National Police (PNP) operations against criminals 
will continue," Ruiz said. 
  If criminals hide in MNLF areas, the Armed Forces of the 
Philippines (AFP) will pursue them -- with the MNLF's help, he 
added. 
  The cease fire agreement will be signed by the joint peace 
panel represented by Manuel Yan, former ambassador to Thailand 
and AFP chief of staff, representing the government and Misuari 
for the MNLF. 
  The AFP and the PNP will provide security for Misuari when 
he 
and his group will travel to Cotabato and other provinces of 
Mindanao. [passage omitted]

Defense Subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee, 
paid a visit to Vietnam with four aides. 
  The delegation was received by Dang Quan Thuy, National 
Assembly vice chairman and chairman of the National Assembly 
Defense Committee. The delegation also met Deputy Foreign 
Minister Le Mai, Deputy Trade Minister Ta Ca, and Nguyen Nhac, 
deputy minister chairman of the Cooperation and Investment State 
Commission. During the meetings, Senators Inouye and Stevens 
affirmed that it was time to close the sorrowful page of the 
past in U.S.-Vietnamese relations in order to build a better 
future for the two peoples. They also said that the long-term 
relationship between the two countries should be based on mutual 
understanding, respect, and benefits. 
  The senators also wished that U.S. businessmen would soon 
have opportunity to do business in Vietnam. The delegation also 
expressed concern about the fate of American servicemen missing 
in the war, and thanked the Vietnamese Government and people for 
their positive cooperation in this issue, thus contributing to 
reducing the agony of the American families who have relatives 
missing in the war. The delegation promised to report this 
situation to the U.S. Senate. 
  The delegation left for home on the afternoon of 11 January.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA Jan 13 -- Dialogue between nations on 
common issues of the world has the effect of narrowing down 
disagreement while promoting mutual understanding, said Deputy 
Foreign Minister Le Mai on Thursday. 
  This trend is growing in present-day international 
relations, 
he said in an interview granted to VIETNAM NEWS AGENCY. 
  Le Mai said each nation has the responsibility of 
guaranteeing human rights within its territorial boundaries. He 
also acknowledged that human rights were the concern of the 
world community as a whole. 
  He said Vietnam agreed to talk with other countries on human 
rights because it wanted those countries to understand that the 
people of Vietnam had given so much for man's sacred fundamental 
rights on this land, and were making tremendous efforts in all 
fields -- political, economic, cultural and social -- to ensure 
human rights in their country. 
  "We will talk with other countries", Le Mai said, "so that a 
correct understanding can be had on the fundamental principles 
of an international law on human rights, namely respect for 
national independence and national sovereignty, respect for the 
right of nations to self-determination, particularly the right 
for each to choose its own path of development, respect for 
national, community of individual rights, respect for political, 
civil, economic and social right of the citizen and respect for 
the right of nations for development which is now a topical 
problem of the world". [sentence as received] 
  Le Mai dismissed recent press reports about dialogue on 
"certain aspects of human rights in Vietnam". "Vietnam and 
other countries have agreed that their exchanges of views will 
be conducted on the basis of equality, mutual respect and 
non-interference", he stressed. 
  Le Mai said he believed the talks would be positive and 
constructive. "If our interlocutors can say concretely where 
and how our law does not conform strictly to international law 
we will [words indistinct] seriously and refer them to 
Vietnamese competent bodies for consideration". 
  "At the same time we will try to make other countries share 
our views that man's most fundamental rights are national self- 
determination and development, which must be strictly 
respected," Le Mai added. 
  He said he hoped the world community, through dialogue, 
would 
gradually establish mutual respect and [words indistinct] and 
equal, mutually beneficial cooperation on human rights. 
  "Human rights should not be used as a tool for one country 
to 
impose on, or interfere in, another country", Le Mai concluded.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA Jan. 13 -- The Vietnamese Embassy in 
Cambodia on Jan. 11 strongly condemned the Khmer Rouge for 
kidnapping two Vietnamese residents when they were fishing in 
Kompong Chhnang Province of Cambodia on Dec. 29, 1993. 
  In a note lodged to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and 
International Cooperation of the Royal Cambodian Government, the 
Vietnamese Embassy quoted a source from the Overseas Vietnamese 
Association in Kompong Chhnang as saying that on Dec. 29, 1993 
Khmer Rouge troops kidnapped Mrs Le Thi Hung, 45, and her 
brother Mr Le Van Sen, 33, while they were fishing on a river 
near the town of Kompong Chhnang. 
  The note strongly condemned that criminal act taken by the 
Khmer Rouge against the Vietnamese residents in Cambodia, and 
requested the Cambodian Government to immediately take drastic 
measures in order to bring the criminals to trial and stop such 
actions of the Khmer Rouge to ensure the lives, property and 
normal life for all Vietnamese residents in Cambodia.

  [Text] In Ho Chi Minh City recently, the Tank and Armored 
Force [TAF] Command held a seminar on its building and training 
tasks during the past period. General Doan Khue, member of the 
party Central Committee Political Bureau and minister of 
National Defense attended the seminar. 
  The TAF commander delivered a report on the activities of 
the 
force during the past few years. He pointed to its great 
efforts in improving its organization and personnel to meet the 
requirements of localities, military regions, and key strategic 
areas. 
  Despite numerous difficulties in equipment, budget, and 
facilities, the TAF has closely coordinated with the army corps, 
military regions, and localities to build and strengthen its 
units, improve training, and maintain combat readiness. The 
force has also striven to recruit and train new cadres, 
specialized personnel, and workers. Various units of the force 
have consistently improved training and fulfilled all their 
assigned tasks. They have closely combined the task of building 
firm and comprehensively strong units with that of modernizing 
and standardizing the army. 
  The seminar provided ample time for delegates of the army 
corps, military regions, and military units to discuss and 
exchange experiences on training and maintaining the spirit of 
combat readiness, military and joint operations, and other tasks 
related to national defense. 
  Speaking at the seminar, the minister stressed: In building 
and training, the TAF should implement the motto: firmly 
maintain basic principles and effectively apply past combat 
experiences. Cadres of the force must carefully study the 
enemy's capabilities while formulating concrete plans and 
projects to enhance the quality of training at various units. 
They must also strive to fulfill their tasks in order to attain 
standardization, build comprehensively strong units, set up firm 
and strong defense zones, and step by step advance toward 
modernizing the army. These are essential tasks for making the 
TAF units strong and firm so that they can fulfill new tasks and 
meet the requirements under all circumstances for the cause of 
national defense and construction.

talks among the so-called "Quad" countries and region on trade, 
a senior Foreign Ministry official said Wednesday [12 January]. 
  The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, 
"Japan cannot agree to such an idea while they neglect to do 
what they should do and are trying to wrench something from 
Japan." 
  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and EU Commissioner 
in charge of External Economic Affairs Leon Brittan have called 
for the opening of negotiations with their counterparts in Japan 
and Canada on market access issues. 
  The official, however, said, "it is another thing if they 
are 
willing to really seriously discuss trade rules."

  [Text] His Excellency [H.E.] Tie Banh, co-minister of 
national defense of the Kingdom of Cambodia, separately met with 
the Malaysian ambassador to Cambodia and a U.S. congressional 
delegation at the Army Foreign Relations Department on 10 
January. 
  After discussing with Malaysian Ambassador H.E. Deva Mohamed 
Ridzam cooperation in the aviation sector, H.E. Gen. Tie Banh 
briefed his guest on some events concerning the security problem 
in the Kingdom of Cambodia. He said that tranquility is 
prevailing across the country, except in some remote areas along 
the northern border where the Khmer Rouge continue to conduct 
their military activities and cause insecurity among the people. 
  H.E. Deva Mohamed Ridzam said from 1957 until it recovered 
full independence and peace, Malaysia, like the Kingdom of 
Cambodia, encountered the same security problem. The Malaysian 
Government, however, adopted stringent measures against border 
bandits until the country achieved genuine peace. 
  H.E. Gen. Tie Banh underlined that the insecurity problem in 
the Kingdom of Cambodia is insignificant and that many countries 
in Asia have also encountered this kind of problem. He said he 
hoped that this problem would be settled in the near future. 
  Later, H.E. Gen. Tie Banh received Mr. Staffdel Wilson, vice 
chairman of the U.S. Congressional Foreign Relations Committee. 
[name and title as heard] 
  H.E. Charles Twining, U.S. ambassador to Cambodia, was also 
present at the audience. 
  H.E. Gen. Tie Banh answered many questions posed by Mr. 
Wilson, who wanted to become acquainted with the situation in 
Cambodia. He particularly wanted to know about the outcome of 
the process of merging the armed forces and about the Khmer 
Rouge problem. 
  H.E. Gen. Tie Banh underlined that the Khmer Royal Armed 
Forces, which is the merger of the troops of the three former 
Cambodian parties, are continuing to carry out their tasks. 
This constitutes a result that we have received with pride and 
national reconciliation spirit. Soon, the Royal Government of 
Cambodia [RGC] will arrange for some uniforms and settle the 
remaining problems once and for all. 
  With regard to the Khmer Rouge issue, H.E. Gen. Tie Banh 
pointed out that the RGC will allow them to join the government 
if they correctly implement the three points requested by the 
government. 
  Mr. Wilson thanked H.E. Gen. Tie Banh for his briefing and 
expressed his pleasure with the political stability and security 
in the Kingdom of Cambodia. 
  As for Ambassador Twining, he said that with the consent of 
the U.S. Congress, the United States will give some materials to 
the RGC; the latter will then give them to the groups of Khmer 
Rouge which have returned to the national community and have 
respected the Kingdom of Cambodia's Constitution. The United 
States will also help restore some damaged roads. Mr. Twining 
promised that he would continue to envision and provide aid 
needed by the Kingdom of Cambodia.

  [Text] Vientiane, January 13 (KPL) -- Counselor Tim Wirth 
talked about prisoners of war [POW] and U.S. soldiers missing in 
action [MIA] in a news briefing held in Washington, U.S.A., on 
January 11, according to a press release of the United States 
Information Service (USIS) issued here on January 12. 
  When asked if there were any U.S. POWs left behind in Laos 
and if Laos is doing enough on the POW/MIA issue, he said that 
this issue had received extensive review in both the legislative 
and executive branches. Following its year-long investigation 
into the POW/MIA issue, the Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA 
affairs noted in its final report: "American officials did not 
have certain knowledge that any specific prisoner or prisoners 
were being left behind." The counselor added that cooperation on 
the POW/MIA issue is a priority in the U.S. relations with Laos. 
The U.S. will continue to press for additional cooperation and 
progress on this issue. 
  505 Americans remain unaccounted for in Laos. Last year, the 
U.S. and Laos conducted six joint field activities. However, 
more than 80 percent of the persons unaccounted for in Laos were 
actually lost in areas under the control of the North 
Vietnamese. This demonstrates the importance of the first-ever 
trilateral operation with Vietnam, which was completed on 
December 20, said the release. 
  The release also added that the first field activity for 
1994 
was scheduled to begin later this month.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 12 (KCNA) -- The Seoul-based 
radio Voice of National Salvation published a communique on the 
external activities of the South Korean National Democratic 
Front [SKNDF] (Hanminjon). 
  According to the communique, a delegation of Hanminjon led 
by 
vice-chairman of its Central Committee Hong Chi-yong visited 
Belgium in late November last year and held two rounds of talks 
with a delegation of the Belgian Labour Party led by chairman of 
its Central Committee Ludo Martens. 
  At the talks, Hanminjon expressed support and solidarity for 
the Belgian party's struggle for the interests of the working 
class and other working masses, social progress and world peace 
and noted with appreciation that the Belgian party was striving 
to implement the Pyongyang declaration after signing it. 
  The Belgian Labour Party recognised Hanminjon guided by the 
chuche idea as the organisation representing the desire and will 
of the South Korean people and the patriotic vanguard of the 
movement for a change in South Korea and highly estimated the 
South Korean people's struggle for independence, democracy and 
reunification. It also urged the South Korean authorities to 
stop their acts of dependence, fascism, division and war. 
  The Belgian Labour Party recognised "10-point programme of 
the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the 
country" put forward by the great leader President Kim Il-song 
as the best way of removing the danger of catastrophic war and 
tragic division and achieving peace and reunification on the 
Korean peninsula, and expressed support and solidarity for the 
struggle of Hanminjon and the South Korean people to realise the 
10-point programme. 
  Hanminjon and the Belgian Labour Party published a joint 
statement expressing their will to support and closely cooperate 
with each other on the principles of independence, mutual 
respect and non-interference in other's internal affairs and 
further develop inter-party relations through expanded mutual 
contacts. 
  The Hanminjon delegation also visited Switzerland where it 
held talks with a delegation of ohe Workers' Party of 
Switzerland led by President Josef Zisyadis and with former 
mayor of Geneva Roger Dafflon who is Politburo member of the 
Workers' Party of Switzerland, president Edith Ballantyne and 
the general secretary of the International League of Women for 
Peace and Freedom, and others.

  [Text] With regard to the Japan-U.S. summit talks 
scheduled in Washington in February, U.S. Under Secretary of 
State Wirth stated on 11 Janaury that "the summit talks would be 
held on both 11 and 12 February," and that "the talks would 
probably be also held in the late hours of 10 February." 
According to the accord reached last July, the summit talks 
would be held on 11 February only. A Japanese Foreign Ministry 
source has stated that "no proposal has been made for extending 
the schedule for the talks." However, it is observed that due 
to the rough going at the Japan-U.S. new economic consultations, 
the U.S. Government has strengthened its position of "arranging 
sufficient time for the summit talks so as to bring the 
consultations to a conclusion." 
  At the news conference held on 11 January, Under Secretary 
Wirth stated: "Our most urgent objective is arranging the 
Clinton-Hosokawa talks on 11 and 12 February so that they may 
discuss the economic consultations currently under way between 
Japan and the United States. We hope that the results of these 
consultations will be announced on these two days. (Depending 
on the political itinerary of the Japanese side,) the summit 
talks may even start in the late hours of 10 February." 
  It is observed that the U.S. side intends to extend the 
summit talks, which were orignally scheduled for only one day, 
to over two days so that the summit talks themselves -- rather 
than prior talks at the vice ministerial level as originally 
scheduled -- would become the final stage for consultations.

  [Text] Washington, 11 Jan -- The Governments of Japan and 
the United States in their economic framework talks held the 
fifth working-group meeting on the insurance sector in 
Washington on 11 January, but failed to make any headway with 
them continuing to differ over the question of objective 
criteria. They will meet in Washington once again before the 
vice ministerial-level meeting set for 24 and 25 January. The 
insurance sector belongs to the priorirty area in the framework 
talks, and the two governments are required to come up with a 
report on it before the Japan-U.S. summit on 11 February, but it 
is likely that the negotiations will drag on till the last 
moment. 
  The two countries confronted each other over three points: 
1) 
the substance of the objective criteria; 2) the participation of 
Japanese firms in the U.S. market; and 3) the scope of areas 
where the government power is supposed to reach. The three 
points are all those related to the countries' basic stands in 
the framework talks. Even though the United States insists it is 
"not seeking to set market-share targets on the premise of 
taking retaliatory actions," it demands that shares comparable 
to those in the industrialized nations (G-7) be cited as one of 
the accepted objective criteria, while Japan is opposed to it. 
  The Japanese delegation insisted that the "cited market 
share 
will become de facto numerical targets." Japan also insists 
that the Japanese companies' access to the U.S. insurance market 
should be included in the talks, but the United States is 
opposed to it.

  [Text] "Negotiations with Japan are always concluded after 
having all-night sessions for about three days on final days. 
Japanese negotiators like to work overnight. Probably, they 
always camp out to be trained for all-night negotiations." 
  With Japan-U.S. summit talks just ahead, U.S. negotiators 
are 
strengthening their criticism of Japanese bureaucrats over 
Japan-U.S. comprehensive trade talks, where progress is hardly 
being made. However, Joan Spero, U.S. under secretary of state 
for economic and agricultural affairs, sarcastically criticized 
Japan's slow negotiation style at a news conference held at the 
Japan Press Club on 12 January. 
  Spero "analyzed" Japan's negotiation attitude, saying, "When 
they play judo, Japanese always assume the defensive position. 
She said: It seems that they think there are steps they have to 
go through in negotiations, too." At the initial stage, they 
flatly refuse our demands, saying "there is absolutely no 
discrimination against foreign companies and the markets are 
open to all." But, they would say "let's talk a little" if the 
United States makes counterarguments by citing data and 
examples. Thus, the second stage of discussions starts. 
  She added that Japanese "hardly show their hand." In this 
way, she made a cutting remark at negotiation technique of 
Japanese bureaucrats. 
  She said that unlike "Americans, who immediately reveal 
their 
intention because they are good-natured people," Japanese 
negotiators start to bring all-night discussions to a settlement 
at midnight on the very last day of negotiation period. 
  As she said this, reporters at the news conference burst 
into 
laughter. But, Spero explained the current situation, saying: 
"(The trade talks) are still at the first stage and we are 
arguing whether the Japanese markets are open or closed to 
foreign companies." She concluded the news conference by saying 
that "we are trying to get enough sleep now to be ready for the 
final all-night sessions" so that we will not be beaten by the 
tough Japanese bureaucrats.

  [Text] U.S. Under Secretary of State Joan E. Spero, who is 
currently visiting Japan, gave an interview in Tokyo on 12 
January. Touching on the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, Spero 
stated: "No progress has been noted in the talks on different 
sectors. It seems that there are situations in which Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will be asked to handle issues on the 
basis of his political responsibility." 
  In this way, Spero disclosed her expectation that Prime 
Minister Hosokawa would make political decisions on the final 
settlement of various issues in such priority sectors as 
automobiles and auto parts, government procurement, and 
insurance, over which the two countries are currently locked in 
tough negotiations.

  [Text] At his meeting with top leaders of four economic 
groups held on the afternoon of 12 January, Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa touched on new economic discussions between 
Japan and the United States and said: "At the Japanese-U.S. 
summit talks set for February, I will say again that the 
Japanese Government cannot set numerical targets for the private 
sector." In this way, he clarified his view that he will not 
accept the U.S. demand to set concrete figures as objective 
criteria to measure the degree of Japan's market liberalization. 
  Japan and the United States are facing rough going in 
discussions over the three sectors: insurance services, autos 
and auto parts, and government procurement. As for the 
establishment of the objective criteria in particular, the 
opinions of the two countries are sharply divided. 
  In the 12 January meeting, Prime Minister Hosokawa stated: 
"I said at the summit talks held last November in Seattle in 
the United States that I could not accept numerical targets. I 
would like to confirm this again at the upcoming summit talks." 
  Moreover, saying that "multilateral actions are needed to 
prevent the United States from invoking Article 301 of the 
Omnibus Trade Act," Hosokawa clarified his plan to use the World 
Trade Organization (WTO), which will be formed in 1995 as a 
result of an agreement reached at the Uruguay Round (new 
multilateral trade negotiations of the GATT), to prevent 
sanctions between the two countries. 
  As for the issue of financial resources for an income tax 
cut, which will be a pillar of his economic measures, Prime 
Minister Hosokawa stated: "The Social Democratic Party of Japan 
understands the need to carry out a fundamental reform of the 
tax system. However, it has a different understanding when it 
comes to the consumption tax." In this way, he stressed the 
difficulty of ironing out the differences of opinion within the 
ruling parties over the issue of increasing the consumption tax 
rate. 
  Moreover, he commented on the Finance Ministry, which wants 
to limit a lead period of a tax cut to 15 months, and stressed: 
"I do not know if it [15 months] is enough to convince the 
people. We have to study how we can cut spending and accomplish 
fairness in the tax." He also said that "some kind of political 
decision will be needed" after the government's investigatory 
council for tax reform reaches its conclusions on a reform of 
the tax system for fiscal year 1994.

  [Text] An unofficial session of the Japan-U.S. 
construction talks started in Tokyo on 12 January. The United 
States has set 20 January as the date on which it will impose 
sanctions unless agreement is reached. With the deadline close 
at hand, the Japanese Government has sought the understanding of 
the U.S. Government by working out an action program, including 
a plan to introduce the general competitive bidding system for 
public works in April. 
  For those projects sponsored by prefectural governments that 
will be eligible for the bidding system, the Japanese Government 
has set the cost of projects at "more than about 2.3 billion 
yen." The U.S. Government, however, has demanded that this 
ceiling be lowered. 
  Moreover, although the Japanese Government intends to 
abolish 
in April the major project arrangement (MPA), which was 
exclusively worked out to help American companies, the U.S. 
Government wants it continued. It is expected there will be 
some tough talking before an accord is reached.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 14 January Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] A government source disclosed 13 January that Japan 
and the United States had basically reached an accord at the 
Japan-U.S. construction talks on Japan opening its public works 
projects to foreign countries. Agreement had been reached 
because the U.S. side had indicated it basically accepted the 
action program suggested by the Japanese side at the unofficial 
talks that started in Tokyo at the beginning of the week. 
  The action program looks to introduce a general competitive 
bidding system for large-scale public works projects beginning 
fiscal 1994. Under the program foreign companies will be 
treated on equal terms as Japanese companies. The action 
program will be officially approved by the cabinet meeting 
scheduled for 18 January. 
  The two countries have also agreed to exchange data on the 
number and cost of projects for which orders have been given to 
foreign companies, in an attempt to measure the degree of market 
opening. The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) has indicated it 
will support the imposition of sanctions against Japan if no 
accord is reached by 20 January. However, with agreement now 
reached, it has become certain that sanctions can be avoided. 
  According to the action program agreed on by two countries 
the scale of projects to be sponsored by the central government, 
and for which the general competition bidding system will be 
introduced, will be set at more than 4.5 million SDR's (special 
drawing rights, approximately 700 million yen). 
  The level has been set at 15 million SDR's [about 2.5 
billion 
yen] for projects sponsored by local governments, including 
prefectures and special municipalities, and the 84 state-run 
corporations government, including Eastern Japan JR [Japan 
Railways], Japan Highway Public Corporation, and NTT [Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone].

<F P=106> [JIJI report] </F>
  [Text] New York, 10 Jan -- At a seminar held at a hotel in 
New York City on 10 January under the auspices of JIJI, Takakazu 
Kuriyama, Japanese ambassador to the United States, said that 
Japan needs to introduce economic measures soon to successfully 
conclude the Japan-U.S. comprehensive economic talks. Moreover, 
he stressed that Japan and the United States should return their 
economic relations to a stable foundation by overcoming a sense 
of mutual distrust over such issues as an introduction of 
objective criteria and by holding constructive discussions 
within several weeks (prior to the Japanese-U.S. summit talks 
scheduled to be held in February). 
  On overall Japan-U.S. relations, the ambassador explained 
that both countries are focusing their attention only on 
economic competition and that light is not being shed on 
cooperation that both countries are carrying out in various 
areas, including aid to Russia, the peace process in Cambodia, 
and environmental issues. He said that tension exists between 
the two countries because they are unable to maintain a balance 
in their relations. He also pointed out that an important task 
is how to create a balance in their "competitive and 
cooperative" ties. 
  The ambassador then pointed out that a growing number of 
people in the United States no longer "feel that Japan poses a 
threat" and that they are becoming optimistic about Japan-U.S. 
relations thanks to noticeable changes in which the "United 
States regained confidence but Japan lost confidence" following 
the U.S. economic recovery in the past six months under the 
Clinton administration. He explained his belief that Japan-U.S. 
relations have started to change. 
  Moreover, Ambassador Kuriyama said that Japan is also to 
blame for the economic tension that exists between Japan and the 
United States. He added that he has no choice but to admit that 
Japan's insufficient structural reform during the time when the 
yen was strong created a big gap between purchasing power parity 
and the market exchange rate.

  [Text] A reversal in the balance of power between Japan 
and the United States in international stock investments has 
become evident. U.S. foreign stock investments (buying on 
balance) in 1993 was 2.5 times that of the previous year, 
totalling more than $120 billion. This surpassed Japan's 
investments at its peak (in 1989; $120 billion). Backed by low 
interest rates in the United States, capital from pension funds 
and personal investment trust funds flowed into the stock 
markets in Asia, Europe, and Latin America. On the other hand, 
Japanese investment in foreign stocks (buying on balance) was 
around $36 billion from January to November 1993, equivalent to 
less than one-third of the U.S. investments. This switch of 
leading player in international stock investments reflects the 
change in the balance of power in the international financial 
market brought about by the economic recovery in the United 
States and the prolonged recession in Japan. 
  According to statistics compiled by the U.S. Federal Reserve 
Board (FBR), stock investments of U.S. residents in foreign 
countries for the whole of 1993, estimated from figures for 
January to September, exceeded $120 billion. Until 1988, U.S. 
foreign stock investments had been less than $10 billion yearly. 
This started to increase in the second half of 1989, and has 
grown rapidly in the 1990's. Behind this increase is the 
expansion of investment funds from the pension funds and 
investment trust funds. 
  With the increase in available capital, U.S. pension funds 
began to turn to stock markets in Europe, Asia, and Latin 
America, where the United States used to take a more cautious 
approach. Moreover, personal funds withdrawn from bank accounts 
due to low interest rates have also gone into overseas markets 
through investment trust funds. 
  According to the U.S. investment trust association ICI 
[Investment Company Institute], net capital flow into overseas 
investment trust funds from January to October 1993 was $26.6 
billion, about four times that of the comparable period in the 
previous year. 
  In 1993, the upheaval in the foreign exchange mechanism of 
the European Monetary System (EMS) subsided, and stock markets 
in the European countries enjoyed stable growth. This added 
fuel to investments from the United States. Furthermore, "the 
flow of capital into the Mexican market in anticipation of the 
signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and 
the Southeast Asian countries, which continued to enjoy high 
economic growth," was subtantial (according to the Nomura 
Research Institute). 
  On the other hand, while Japanese investments in overseas 
stock markets maintained a high level at $80-100 billion 
annually from 1986 to 1988, and "Japan money" had great 
influence in the international financial market, this has 
declined rapidly since investments peaked at $120 billion in 
1989. According to Finance Ministry statistics, investments in 
overseas stocks from January to November 1993 amounted to only 
$35.9 billion, or less than one-third of the volume during the 
peak period. Not only has financial speculation through 
overseas stock investments decreased since the bursting of the 
bubble economy, life insurance companies and other institutional 
investors have also taken a more cautious attitude toward 
foreign stock market investments involving exchange rate risks 
with the progressive appreciation of the yen, and the decline in 
latent profits from domestic stockholdings. 
  The Japanese private sector, which used to be the leading 
player in international stock investments, now avoids the risks 
involved in such investments due to the prolonged economic 
recession. The private sector in the United States, which has 
overtaken Japan in economic recovery, now replaces Japan as the 
source of capital in the Asian and European markets. Analysts 
say that "the second half of the 1980's was the era of Japan 
money, while the first half of the 1990's will see the dominance 
of American money" (according to the Mitsubishi Bank's 
International Capital and Foreign Exchange Division).

  [Text] Beijing, 10 Jan -- Hiroshi Hirabayashi, chief of 
the Foreign Ministry's Economic Cooperation Bureau, met with Wu 
Yi, Chinese minister of foreign economic relations and trade, on 
10 January to ask her to speed up the work of listing projects 
intended for the fourth yen loan. He also indicated five fields 
that Japan believes should be considered important in providing 
the fourth yen loan. 
  The five fields are: 1) preservation of environment; 2) 
economic infrastructure, such as transportation and 
communications; 3) city infrastructure, such as water supply and 
drainage; 4) agriculture; and 5) assistance to economically 
undeveloped areas in inland of China. The bureau chief 
expressed his hope to emphasize the northeast region among other 
regions in providing aid, saying: "We would like to place 
emphasis on the northeast region which is close to Japan." 
  Moreover, because the fourth yen loan will be the major 
focal 
point during Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to China 
in March -- the visit is now under coordination between Japan 
and China, Hirabayashi called on China to include "projects that 
could become a symbol of friendship between Japan and China" in 
lists of China's requests for the yen loan. Hirabayashi said 
Japan "would like to decide on projects for aid, which will be 
provided in three years, as soon as possible." 
  Minister Wu said: "China regards Japan as the largest 
partner in economic cooperation. We agree to the Japanese idea 
of emphasizing preservation of environment."

<F P=106> [By special correspondent A. Portov] </F>
  [Text] Vladivostok, 12 Jan -- A senior officer in the 
Pacific Fleet Command in the Russian Far East revealed on 12 
January that the Pacific Fleet Command plans to export four 
Foxtrot-class submarines -- now deployed at Vladivostok Naval 
Base -- to North Korea and that the contract on their sale has 
already been been signed with North Korea. 
  The contract has been pushed on top secret instructions from 
Navy headquarters in Moscow, and the price remains a secret. 
Officially, North Korea says it will dismantle the submarines 
and use the steel materials therefrom. But a source at Fleet 
Command said North Korea could repair the submarines to create a 
new submarine flotilla or use their parts to repair other 
submarines. 
  The submarines were built in the 1960's. At present, they 
belong to the Submarine Training Brigade and are docked in 
Ussuri Bay.

  [Text] The government has decided to increase official 
development assistance (ODA) for joint projects with other 
advanced nations. With the growing number of ODA recipients, it 
has become increasingly difficult for Japan to undertake 
assistance alone due to linguistic or technical problems. Japan 
will, therefore, aim at more effective aid through joint 
international ODA projects. It will discuss new joint projects 
in African and Asian countries with Canada, Sweden, South 
Africa, Israel, and the EC Commission, while also increasing 
existing joint international ODA efforts with the United States, 
Britain, and other countries. 
  Japan's ODA has again surpassed the United States in 1993, 
becoming the world's top aid donor for three consecutive years. 
While ODA from the Western nations has leveled off, Japan's ODA 
has been increasing not only in Asia, but also in Africa and 
Latin America, where it used to give minimal assistance. Plans 
for ODA in East Europe and the Central Asian states of the 
former USSR have also come up for consideration since 1993. 
  However, there are problems such as the shortage of Japanese 
technicians who can speak the local languages. Japan will 
attempt to solve these problems by cooperating with other 
advanced nations. Furthermore, this will also ensure more 
efficient management of ODA, the appropriations for which have 
not been increased as expected due to Japan's financial 
difficulties. 
  Japan is considering a joint aid program with South Africa 
for the economic reconstruction of Mozambique, Lesotho, and 
other neighboring countries of South Africa. Such a joint aid 
program with South Africa will also express the Japanese 
Government's approval of the democratization efforts in South 
Africa, which has succeeded in instituting a general election 
with black participation for the first time in history. 
  Joint ODA efforts in Africa are also being considered with 
Sweden and Canada, while joint projects will be implemented in 
Africa or Vietnam with Canada. Sweden and Canada are advanced 
nations in terms of ODA. Japan also hopes to acquire ODA 
knowhow from these countries. 
  Cooperative efforts in the area of refugee relief in the 
Philippines, and agricultural development in Thailand have 
already been undertaken with the United States. Japan wants to 
cooperate with the United States in a wildlife conservation 
program in Indonesia.

  [Text] In an effort to help Asian countries and other 
nations beef up their export control of arms and arms-related 
technology, Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] 
is scheduled to establish an "export control support center" on 
10 January within the security trade information center, which 
is MITI's auxiliary organ. Underlying MITI's establishment of 
the support center is its conclusion that as a result of the 
scheduled reorganization of the Coordinating Committee on Export 
Controls (Cocom) in late March as a new organ designed to 
prevent the spread of arms to "strife-potential countries," it 
will be more important to strengthen export control systems of 
countries other than the advanced nations. 
  Three staff members will be working at the support center on 
a full-time basis, and its planned activities will include the 
holding of export control seminars for Asian nations and former 
Soviet republics including Russia, and the dispatch of experts 
to these nations. MITI, in its budgetary requests for fiscal 
1994, has appropriated 40 million yen for the support center. 
It held an export control seminar for Asian nations last 
October for the first time, but from now on, such activities 
will be conducted by the support center.

  [Text] Several government sources disclosed on 11 January 
that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has decided to coordinate 
opinions within the government and the ruling parties to form a 
consensus on the implementation of income and residential tax 
cuts worth more than 8 trillion yen [Y] in fiscal year 1994. 
The tax cuts are the main feature of the government's 
pump-priming package. To fund the cuts, Hosokawa plans to issue 
stopgap government bonds whose repayment period is clearly set. 
However, he will not mention a consumption tax hike in tax 
reform bills to be submitted to the ordinary Diet session, which 
will be convened at the end of January, the sources said. If 
the bills are approved, the tax cuts will be implemented 
retroactive to 1 January. The sources said that two years after 
the implementation of the tax cuts, Hosokawa hopes to reach a 
conclusion on a drastic tax reform to cope with the aging 
society, while remaining mindful of a consumption tax hike. 
  Prime Minister Hosokawa has decided to implement large-scale 
tax cuts as prospects for having four political reform bills 
approved around 20 January have become bright. After the 
passage of the bills, Hosokawa will convene a meeting of the 
Economic Affairs Council to resume discussions on tax reform. 
The council, which has long been inactive, is chaired by Tsutomu 
Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, and is 
composed of government and ruling party officials. Hosokawa 
hopes to make a final decision based on council discussions, the 
ruling parties' policies, and public opinion. 
  After deciding on outlines for tax reform for fiscal year 
1994, Hosokawa hopes to begin compiling the third supplementary 
budget and the draft fiscal year 1994 budget. With these two 
budgets, which cover a 15-month period, the government will make 
an all-out effort to shore up the economy. 
  The prime minister considers tax cuts to be "a shot in the 
arm" for the economy and believes it is necessary to implement 
income and land tax cuts that are as large as possible. 
Accordingly, he has decided to carry out tax cuts of more than 
Y8 trillion, larger than the initially proposed Y6 trillion-Y7 
trillion in tax cuts. In addition to the income and land tax 
cuts, Hosokawa plans to abolish a special corporate tax which 
was introduced during the Gulf war to cope with the crisis, to 
increase the total amount of tax cuts to about Y10 trillion. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton wants the Japanese Government to 
carry out drastic pump-priming measures. To meet his 
expectations, Hosokawa will disclose the tax cut plans during 
the Japan-U.S. summit talks to be held in Washington on 11 
February. 
  Up to this point, Prime Minister Hosokawa has said that "the 
government will not irresponsibly issue deficit-covering bonds" 
to fund income and land tax cuts. However, his recent decision 
indicates that he will not oppose issuing government bonds if 
they are stopgap bonds whose repayment period is clearly set. 
  To make up for the stopgap bonds, the government will need a 
consumption tax hike. But Hosokawa will avoid mentioning the 
tax hike in tax reform bills. Instead, he will just note the 
need for a "drastic reform of the tax system" and "a review of 
the direct-indirect tax ratio."

  [Text] Now that political reform-related bills are 
expected to pass the current Diet session, the idea of 
reshuffling the cabinet as early as immediately after the 
enactment of the bills in late January has suddenly cropped up 
within the government and ruling parties. This was revealed by 
senior members of the ruling parties on 12 January. The idea is 
based on the belief that, after the passage of political reform 
bills, the government needs to portray its image as a 
full-fledged administration which is capable of dealing with 
domestic and diplomatic political tasks, including economic 
pump-priming measures, a new emergency task, and at the same 
time, it needs to create conditions for tackling the regrouping 
of political parties while maintaining the current framework of 
the ruling coalition parties. It is expected that the cabinet 
reshuffle will occur on a small scale. For example, State 
Minister for Political Reform Sadao Yamahana is expected to 
leave the office, and some cabinet members in charge of the 
economy are also expected to be replaced. There is a plan to 
transfer Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura 
(representative of Sakigake [Harbinger]) -- who has taken an 
opposing stance with Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], over handling of the 
reorganization of the political world -- to another post. 
However, the situation is fluid due to such factors as pressing 
time for compilation of the fiscal 1994 draft budget. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa discussed a plan to 
reshuffle the cabinet with Ichiro Ozawa at the end of last year, 
and he is considering the timing and scale of the plan. 
  So far, it has been reported that the most probable plan 
under consideration within the government and ruling parties was 
to reshuffle the cabinet immediately after the passage of a 
draft budget for the next fiscal year through the upcoming 
ordinary Diet session. And, the prime minister had reportedly 
agreed on the plan basically. However, now that political 
reform bills are expected to be enacted and the government needs 
to speed up efforts to create conditions for tackling the 
political situation after the passage of the bills, the idea of 
reshuffling the cabinet as early as at the end of the current 
Diet session has cropped up. There will be no change in posts 
which party leaders are now holding. The main points of the 
reshuffle will be: 1) to appoint an economic expert to be chief 
of the Economic Planning Agency; and 2) to strengthen chief 
cabinet secretary's functions of coordination among cabinet 
members, as well as between the government and the ruling 
parties. 
  Mr. Takemura and Mr. Ozawa have different views on the 
handling of political reform bills. While Mr. Takemura had 
moved to compromise with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], Mr. 
Ozawa has taken a hard-line stance vis-a-vis the LDP. There was 
also a confrontation between Mr. Takemura and some members of 
the government and ruling parties over the timing of compiling a 
draft budget for the next fiscal year. For this reason 
especially, both Shinseito and Komeito have demanded that Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Takemura be replaced with a person who will 
devote single-heartedly to a coordinating role. 
  Faced with such circumstances, there is speculation that Mr. 
Takemura will be transferred to another cabinet post. However, 
he and members of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], 
who have different views from Mr. Ozawa on a strategy for 
regrouping the political parties, will inevitably oppose the 
plan. Although the prime minister is reportedly reluctant to 
dismiss Mr. Takemura as the chief cabinet secretary, some people 
think if Mr. Takemura is relieved at the same time as changes of 
some economic ministers and political reform minister, this will 
soften the cushion that the prime minister "dismisses Mr. 
Takemura" as the chief cabinet secretary. 
  Moreover, Mr. Yamahana himself has indicated an intention to 
resign as political reform minister if political reform bills 
are enacted, since he resigned as SDPJ chairman in September 
last year. Therefore, if the cabinet is reshuffled, there is the 
possibility that political reform minister will be changed, or, 
the post will be abolished. In this case, it is expected that 
the prime minister will ask SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama to 
join the cabinet in order to establish a cooperative 
relationship among all the ruling parties. 
  However, there are views that it is inappropriate to change 
economic ministers immediately before the budget compilation and 
that the issue of how to deal with Mr. Takemura's post may cause 
a crack in the foundation for the Hosokawa administration. For 
this reason, the prime minister intends to be cautious in making 
the final decision.

  [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in a luncheon 
meeting with top leaders of the four major economic 
organizations on 12 January talked about the outlook on the 
House of Councilors' deliberations of the political reform 
bills, and said, "Enactment of the bills on 19 January will be 
difficult." 
  Following the luncheon meeting, an official of the four 
organizations told reporters, "the prime minister said he wants 
to have the bills passed on 19 January and to have the next Diet 
session revise them." But in answer to reporters' question at 
the prime minister's mansion in the evening, Hosokawa denied the 
story, saying: "That is not what I said. They asked me if I 
expected the bills to be passed on 19 January. I told them that 
will probably be difficult."

  [Text] The government and ruling parties held a meeting on 
8 January to discuss political reform bills being deliberated by 
the upper house. At the end of the discussion, they affirmed 
their intention to work to pass the bills without revising such 
key portions of the bills as the constituency unit for the 
proportional representation system and the distribution of the 
fixed number of seats between single-seat constituency seats and 
proportional representation seats. The government and ruling 
parties believe that the opposition Liberal Democratic Party 
[LDP] is seeking a joint revision of key portions of the bills 
with the ruling parties after giving up its filibuster in the 
upper house, and the government and ruling parties view the 
LDP's moves as an attempt to buy time. The Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ] has vehemently opposed amending the bills, 
and the government and ruling parties are believed to have 
decided not to amend the bills after concluding that respecting 
the SDPJ's opposition to amending the bills is indispensable for 
their passage in the Diet. The ruling parties, which decided on 
10 January to hold public hearings on 19 January which are a 
prerequisite for adopting the bills in the special committee on 
political reform of the House of Councillors, intend to pass the 
bills at a plenary session of the House of Councillors. 
  The ruling parties plan to amend such nonkey portions as the 
"3-percent clause," which bans political parties with less than 
3 percent of the total vote from receiving seats in the Diet, 
and the clause that lifts a ban on house-to-house campaigning by 
candidates. The bills are set to be forwarded to the lower house 
for their passage during the current Diet session after being 
amended in the upper house. 
  The government and ruling parties have taken the position 
that if the LDP cooperates with deliberations of the bills in 
the upper house, they will comply with any LDP call for a 
certain amendment of the bills. The LDP decided on 7 January 
that if it reaches an agreement with the ruling parties on 
amending the key portions, it would will the passage of the 
bills in the Diet. The LDP's decision has created a situation 
wherein the ruling parties are forced to come up with ways to 
deal with the opposition party's decision. 
  Some LDP members are asserting that: 1) The 
government-introduced bill sets the constituency unit for the 
proportional representation system as a nationwide unit but that 
the constituency unit should be divided into about 10 
constituency blocs; and 2) The distribution of the fixed number 
of seats between single-seat-constituency seats and 
proportional-representation seats is set at 280 and 274 seats, 
respectively, but that the distribution should be revised. What 
the ruling parties are loath to accept is any demand for an 
amendment which provides for certain regulations which would 
permit the continuation of political contributions by businesses 
and organizations. The SDPJ has strongly argued that "if the 
clause is amended, we will have no choice but to leave the 
coalition government." 
  Conclusions drawn by the ruling parties are that it is 
necessary to win a full guarantee from the LDP that the LDP will 
support the passage of the bills in the Diet if they go along 
with the LDP's demand for an amendment to the key portions, and 
that if they brush aside the SDPJ's resistance without such a 
guarantee from the LDP, this would endanger the passage of the 
bills. It has been observed that there would be little room for 
both the ruling and opposition parties to reach a compromise 
unless the LDP takes a clear-cut stand of supporting the bills 
after drafting compromise proposals acceptable to the ruling 
parties and deciding on them. It has also been observed that in 
the present situation, it is highly risky for the ruling parties 
to promote a quick deal with the LDP on amending the key 
portions in a way that might cause a change to the framework of 
the coalition.

<F P=106> [Interview with LDP President Yohei Kono by unidentified </F>
YOMIURI SHIMBUN reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Reporter] How do you assess the coalition 
government? 
  [Kono] After the new government was inaugurated, a lot 
changed on the surface. But rather than make any new decisions, 
it has put off addressing difficult problems. I also sense a 
dual power structure. 
  [Reporter] How has the Diet been run in the beginning of the 
new year? 
  [Kono] The ruling parties forced deliberations on political 
reform to begin by insisting that "the Diet move quickly to open 
its session." They did not even allow us to have one hour to 
meet to make arrangements. We have insisted that the Diet 
should discuss not only political reform but also pump-priming 
measures, and we have called for the convening of a meeting of 
the budget committee. The ruling parties' position of not 
complying with our request is the same as the stand taken by the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] when we boycotted deliberations 
(in the upper house special committee on political reform). 
  [Reporter] Is the LDP considering overthrowing the cabinet? 
  [Kono] The main issue before the cabinet is how to protect 
the living standards of the people. If we find the cabinet 
incapable, we will have to consider overthrowing it. 
  [Reporter] Will you accept an offer to hold summit talks 
between yourself and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa? 
  [Kono) The ruling parties tend to refuse to consult in the 
final stage. They did so when they pushed through the extension 
of the Diet session. While running the Diet in such a fashion, 
they are calling for "summit talks." They are full of 
inconsistencies between their words and deeds. 
  [Reporter] Is the LDP considering drawing up a compromise 
political reform plan? 
  [Kono] It is important for us to organize our thoughts about 
a compromise political reform plan based on deliberations in the 
upper house and public hearings. 
  [Reporter] Some senior members in the ruling coalition have 
proposed a compromise plan of dividing the nation into electoral 
blocs for proportional representation voting. What do you think 
of this? 
  [Kono] I referred to electoral blocs when I asked Prime 
Minister Hosokawa during the last summit talks whether he 
intended to introduce a cross-prefecture electoral bloc system 
for proportional representation. In response, he said, "I have 
no intention of introducing that system." I do not think that 
the plan you mentioned will be discussed as a compromise 
measure. Moreover, many LDP members prefer prefectural 
electoral blocs. 
  [Reporter] The idea has surfaced within the LDP and the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] that a bill to prevent 
corruption should be separated from the other political reform 
bills to enact that one first. What do you think about this? 
  [Kono] Only a handful of LDP members advocate the idea. From 
the start, the LDP has called for enacting the four bills as one 
package. I do not think that the separation (of one bill from 
the others) is a good idea. But I support the idea of dealing 
with economic recovery and political reform at the same time. 
Each cabinet has a different capacity. The present cabinet 
seems to think that it can only handle political reform, but it 
must also deal with the economy. It is natural for us to ask 
the cabinet to direct part of the energy it is spending on 
political reform to the economy. 
  [Reporter] How will you operate the LDP "when some LDP 
members are prepared to leave the party?" 
  [Kono] In this difficult situation, four members have left 
the party. But the LDP as a whole is moving in the same 
direction. It is true that there is a proreform group and a 
group that takes a cautious approach toward political reform. 
Nevertheless, I hope that all LDP members will reach the goal 
of political reform together. I believe that once the political 
reform issue is settled, the LDP will be able to display its 
innate ability.

<F P=106> [Interview With LDP's Seiichi Ota by Shinzo Oshima, editor </F>
in chief; in Tokyo on 12 August: "Does the Liberal Democratic 
Party Have a Future?"] 
  [Text] Seiichi Ota, Member of the House of 
Representatives and Representative Sponsor for Creating a New 
LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] 
  [Oshima] I see you are tall. What are your height and 
weight? 
  [Ota] Height is 186 centimeters and weight is 84 kilograms. 
  [Oshima] Come to think of it, Former House of 
Representatives 
Yoshio Sakurauchi was also tall. 
  [Ota] Yes. For his generation, he was on the tall side. 
  [Oshima] I would assume you inherited your tallness from 
your 
mother's side. 
  [Ota] My mother (who was named Toshiko and was the younger 
sister of former Speaker Sakurauchi of the House of 
Representatives) was 168 centimeters. And, that was on the tall 
side for someone born in the Taisho era. 
  [Oshima] By the way, how many years did you spend as a 
college instructor? 
  [Ota] Six years, since I worked in universities from the age 
of 28 to 34. 
  [Oshima] Had you hoped to become a college professor from 
your younger days? 
  [Ota] I did not feel that way when I entered college. When I 
finished college, I felt I did not want to restrict my lifetime 
outlook and went on to graduate school. Once you proceed to 
graduate school, you become restricted to a teaching career. The 
more time you spend in graduate school, the harder it becomes to 
find employment. 
  [Oshima] Did you have your eye on potential future career 
paths when you decided to teach at Fukuoka University in your 
hometown? 
  [Ota] I accepted a job there because the chairman of the 
Economics Department strongly urged me to take the job at the 
school. It was a case where I did not have the luxury of 
selecting the university I would teach at. 
  [Oshima] For someone who later became the action group 
leader 
of the LDP, I admire you for having tolerated research work for 
as many as six years. 
  [Ota] Oh, but I never disliked working in a college 
environment. Even now, I feel that I would like to return to the 
college environment if my political career were to come to an 
end. Given a preference, I feel that my real place in life is to 
engage in economic research. 
<H5>  Strict Assistant Professor </H5>
  [Oshima] What was your specialty in the area of economics? 
  [Ota] Economic theory. I taught economic theory. Another 
name 
for economic theory is mathematical economics, but I did not 
treat the study of this discipline as something trivial but as 
the starting point for my career. 
  [Oshima] Did you feel you were popular among your students? 
  [Ota] No. I was not popular among my students. I was strict 
with my students. Roughly 40 percent of the students failed my 
courses. Of special note is that 60 percent of the students 
failed the test that immediately preceded my candidacy as a 
member of the House of Representatives. Thus, the students that 
I graded in my final year at the college held ill feelings 
towards me. The situation was such that the students formed a 
"group to demand the firing of seiichi Ota" (laugh). 
  [Oshima] Why is it that an assistant college professor 
changed careers to the political world which is a maelstrom of 
Machiavellianism? 
  [Ota] Economics involves the construction of models of the 
real world and attendant analysis of results emanating from 
their prescribed manipulation. The discipline is a world in 
which one performs a constant check on the accuracy and 
realistic traits of the model. I would imagine that anyone 
specializing in economics will at one time or another hope that 
he could participate in the real economic world. He should 
aspire to join the political world, if the opportunity were to 
present itself. 
  [Oshima] Would I be correct in saying that politics was one 
of your career options from your younger days? 
  [Ota] During my college days, I used to journey to Shimane 
Prefecture for each House of Representative election to make 
roadside speeches on behalf of my uncle (former Speaker 
Sakurauchi of the House of Representatives). I always held in 
the back of my mind the idea that life does provide that 
particular career option. 
  Once he became a Diet member, Mr. Ota began to 
demonstrate himself to be a combative type far removed from 
scholarly characteristics. He consistently attacked the Tanaka 
and Takeshita forces. His attacks were such that they were not 
typical of a member belonging to the "noble members" of the 
Miyazawa faction. When former Prime Minister Tanaka was found 
guilty in his initial trial, an LDP consensus was formed to 
"remove Tanaka" which was led by Mr. Ota. 
  When suspicions were directed at Prime Minister Noboru 
Takeshita in connection with the Recruit scandal, Ota joined 
Shizuka Kamei, Takeo Hiranuma, and Katsuhiko Shirakawa to form 
the "Jiyukakushindoshikai" and initiated a movement to overthrow 
the Takeshita cabinet. In this connection, when Prime Minister 
Takeshita designated Mr. Sosuke Uno as his successor, this group 
reacted by attempting to promote the candidacy of Mr. Ganri 
Yamashita. Further, this interview was hurriedly conducted, 
after 1600 hours, 12 August immediately following the plenary 
session, in Room 432 of the House of Representatives Members 
Building No. 2. 
  [Oshima] I was following the activities of the 
"Jiyukakushindoshikai" which was formed by Mr. Ota and others 
with interest because of its lively activities, but it seems the 
organization is no longer active. 
  [Ota] Of the four leaders, Mr. Katsuhiko Shirakawa later 
lost 
an election, although he has since been reelected. And, Mr. 
Shizuka Kamei and Mr. Takeo Hiranuma have been appointed 
responsible positions in the Mitsuzuka faction and no longer 
participate in antiestablishment movements (laugh). That leaves 
me all by myself. 
  In the past, there were very few LDP Diet members who 
assumed 
a clear-cut critical stand against Mr. Kanemaru. During the 
broadcasting of my political views during the last House of 
Representatives election, I gave a speech on the theme that we 
must eliminate the two-tier power structure. At least until the 
first half of last year, I was the only one that assumed an 
unequivocal stand against the Keiseikai (Takeshita faction). 
  [Oshima] What sort of position did your next-door associate 
take? 
  [Ota] Mr. Shokei Arai (Room 433 of the House of 
Representatives Diet Members' Building No.2) assumed a clear-cut 
anti-Keiseikai position from the summer of 1992. 
  [Oshima] Were any threats posed by the Keiseikai? 
  [Ota] Various things happened, but they were not of a nature 
that would prompt me to become discouraged about my ideas. Even 
now, some politicians do harbor Keiseikai-type concepts. 
  Waging struggles against such concepts is one of my life 
philosophies. Even Mr. Kanemaru and Mr. Ichiro Ozawa know that I 
am that type of individual. 
<H5>  We Are the True Reformists of the Founder </H5>
  [Oshima] As I recall, it was the fall of 1992 that you 
initiated a move to impeach Kanemaru. 
  [Ota] We formed the "Group To Recover Confidence in the LDP" 
for the purpose of impeaching Mr. Kanemaru. We started out with 
a group of seven, but by the time Mr. Kanemaru resigned, it had 
grown to about 20 members. 
  [Oshima] I understand that group evolved into the "Group To 
Create a New LDP." How many members do you have now? 
  [Ota] Forty-six. 
  [Oshima] I see that does not equal the 47 warriors of the 
feudal days, but was there not a time when the various political 
incidents prompted the group of 45 to secede from the party? 
  [Ota] What point in time are you speaking of? 
  [Oshima] I was thinking of the middle of June of this year, 
just before and after the vote of no confidence was cast against 
the Miyazawa cabinet. 
  [Ota] At that time, both myself and Shokei Arai had no 
perception that a problem existed. It was a time when the 
situation was in great turmoil. At that time, the issue did not 
concern an overall political reform, but simply the issue of 
election system reform. Both myself and Mr. Arai are of the 
opinion that election system reform should be implemented, but 
we cannot agree with the position that that alone will cover the 
entire issue. I also cannot logically understand the creation of 
a new party on the premise of election system reform. 
  The term reformist is used too lightly. They say that 
reformists are involved in the revision of the election system, 
but the question arises as to how things stood if we turn the 
clock back to the fall of last year. At that time we were the 
reformists. At that time our foremost political reform issues 
concerned the proposed resignation of Mr. Kanemaru who was the 
unquestioned symbol of money corruption, breakup of the 
Keiseikai, and an end to control of Diet members by factional 
alliances. 
  [Oshima] So I see. The members of Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party] were sustaining Mr. Kanemaru. 
  [Ota] It was not a case of sustaining Mr. Kanemaru, but 
acting as if they were Mr. Kanemaru himself. 
  Further, young politicians such as Shigeru Ishiba of the 
"Group Calling for the Establishment of Political Reform" did 
not utter one word during the Kanemaru incident. That particular 
reformist group failed to play any role in connection with the 
Kanemaru incident or the breakup of the Keiseikai. 
<H5>  Era of Political Parties Is Gone </H5>
  [Oshima] Many things have happened, but I get the impression 
that party politics stands at a crossroad. 
  [Ota] I believe the era of political parties has ended. I 
believe it would be detrimental to allow the political party 
known as the LDP to remain in control of the situation. The 
Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is detrimental and so 
is the Japan New Party (JNP). In essence, the struggle between 
socialism and liberalism has ended. The significance of having 
established political parties no longer exists. 
  [Oshima] Oh. 
  [Ota] Why was the LDP formed in 1955? The right and left 
factions of the Socialist Party combined and the Liberal Party 
and Democratic Party combined as if to follow suit. It was a 
case of the SOPJ creating the LDP. Now that the reason for 
existence of the SDPJ no longer exists, the same is true with 
the LDP. A middle-of-the-road political party was created 
because the confrontation between the two parties was not a 
desirable situation. Once the significance of LDP-SDPJ existence 
is gone, the significance of a middle-of-the-road party is also 
lost. 
  [Oshima] Then, what happens to the political world? 
  [Ota] We should organize the Diet into an organization that 
respects the independence of individual Diet members, because 
differences in opinions among individual Diet members do exist 
in the final analysis. Political parties can be left in ruin, 
but political actions should be taken on the merits of the 
visions and convictions of individual Diet members. 
  I believe the parliamentary democracy found in the United 
States would be a good format. Members of the U.S. Democratic 
and Republican Parties are not restricted by party decisions. 
Individual congressmen cast their votes based on their own 
responsibility and then seek a showing of confidence from 
individual constituents. Although they belong to a party, the 
system provides for a very high degree of independence on the 
part of the congressmen. 
  [Oshima] In Japan, it appears little consideration is given 
to the independence of Diet members. 
  [Ota] Differences in views between Diet members are greater 
than differences in views between political parties. As an 
example, differences in opinion between Mr. Koko Sato, formerly 
of the LDP Executive Department, and me were greater than those 
between me and SDPJ Diet members of the same age group. This 
fact becomes readily obvious when individual comparisons are 
made. 
  When a majority vote is sought in the Diet, the individual 
parties begin to pressure their members and the situation is 
wrought with complications. Individual executive departments 
establish ties with any one to protect their predominant 
positions. The result is Diet decisions which are biased. I 
believe an entirely different outcome would result from a true 
majority decision. 
  [Oshima] I will pose a vulgar question, but relative to 
orders from LDP President Yohei Kono, orders from Kochikai 
leader Kiichi Miyazawa, and the will of the Group To Create a 
New LDP, where do you place your priorities? 
  [Ota] The LDP president is not allowed to issue orders. The 
LDP acts only on the basis of consensus. The question becomes 
one of how much of a role I play in the creation of a consensus 
for the LDP. Even Mr. Miyazawa does not issue orders. When the 
Kochikai is in the process of forming a consensus, I make a 
variety of statements in an attempt to reflect my opinions. 
  [Oshima] If Mr. Masayoshi Ohira were still alive, you would 
have complied with his orders. I believe you're saying that no 
such person exists at the present time. 
  [Ota] No, you're in slight error. Each individual Diet 
member 
enjoys the confidence of the general public. If I were required 
to comply with orders from Mr. Miyazawa, you would think that 
constituents of the Third District in Hiroshima ranked higher 
than the constituents of the First District in Fukuoka. I 
believe we should not be placed in the position of being issued 
orders. 
  Needless to say, I do compromise and make concessions in 
order to form a consensus, but if I were placed in the position 
of receiving unilateral orders from someone, I would be guilty 
of a breach of trust in relation to my constituents. 
  [Oshima] I understand there are a number of political 
parties 
where rank-and-file Diet members are unilaterally issued orders 
(laugh). 
  [Ota] The LDP has some value because it does not act in 
compliance with someone's orders as they do in Shinseito, 
Komeito, and the Japan Communist Party (JCP). They speak of 
strict control by the faction or strict control by the Executive 
Department, but in comparison to other parties, the LDP is 
relatively free of strict control. 
  [Oshima] Yes, that seems to be the case. Now that you say 
so, 
I understand the situation. 
  [Ota] I believe the highest estimate of those LDP Diet 
members who can say the party did something for them in the 
process of becoming politicians is 10 or 20 percent. That gives 
you an idea of how small a role the party plays in the creation 
of a single LDP Diet member. I was fortunate in being officially 
recognized from the very beginning, but there are very few 
junior Diet members who waged their first election campaigns 
with the blessing of the party. 
<H5>  Diathesis of Shinseito and Komeito </H5>
  [Oshima] Have you ever met a senior politician who was 
willing to sacrifice himself for a cause? 
  [Ota] Never. I have done a number of things in the 
establishment of the Miyazawa government, thinking that it would 
be a good cause, but without his orders. Even in connection with 
the Kanemaru scandal, his downfall should have provided for 
conditions conducive to placing Miyazawa in a position to more 
easily exercise leadership. We took action for the downfall of 
Kanemaru, but Miyazawa failed to assume leadership in forming a 
second cabinet. I was very disappointed because of his failure 
to act. 
  I will not say that I was the only one to continuously 
advise 
Mr. Miyazawa within the Miyazawa faction to run in elections for 
party president, but there were only a few who did so. In fact, 
there were more individuals who according to the circumstances 
then prevailing advised him that it was not the right time and 
that he should side with someone with more potential. 
  [Oshima] What do you fear most about the Hosokawa 
government? 
  [Ota] I believe the Hosokawa government is in reality the 
Shinseito government. Very strong leadership is being exercised 
by Shinseito and Komeito. I am very concerned about this 
situation. 
  Although this may sound just like the criticism addressed 
relative to the Keiseikai at one time, the reason is that 
Keiseikai was not a place for healthy debate within the faction. 
It was of the same diathesis as the Communist Party and Komeito. 
In previous times, when Mr. Kanemaru or Mr. Ozawa said, "Face 
right," everyone faced right without any discussion whatsoever. 
  If one were to speak of the strong unity, the flip side of 
the coin would have revealed that particular situation. It was a 
unified group in which individualism was suppressed, giving 
birth to such a situation. The faction was plagued by those 
circumstances from the days of Mr. Tanaka. I for one rebelled at 
the situation. Both Komeito and the Shinseito are plagued by 
such a diathesis. 
  [Oshima] True. They have much in common. 
  [Ota] Yes. They are similar. I believe that organizations 
that do not allow for open debate by individual Diet members are 
a very detrimental existence to the principles of democracy in 
this nation. 
  Even Mr. Morihiro Hosokawa first said, "I will follow a 
third 
path," next spoke of "cooperation from outside the cabinet" and 
then became prime minister. He went through three stages. 
  In effect, he took advantage of Shinseito and Komeito. 
Leadership is being exercised from and everything is influenced 
by pronouncements from these two parties. I believe that 
situation makes for a very frightening future. 
  [Oshima] Both Shinseito and Komeito are formidable 
opponents. 
  [Ota] And, they are able to wage strong election campaigns. 
Setting aside the question of whether one should join Shinseito 
or Komeito, there is an atmosphere that indicates individuals 
who are not sympathizers will not be able to survive. If the 
situation remains unchanged, they'll be able to win 70 percent 
of the Diet seats. If one were to think of the future, he might 
visualize fascism. If an election were to be held under the 
single-seat constituency system under current conditions, I 
believe we will see the creation of Japanese politics controlled 
by fascism. The general public will probably awaken to reality 
when that happens, but then it will be too late. 
  [Oshima] You are speaking of a loud victorious laugh coming 
from Ichiro Ozawa and Taisaku Ikeda. 
  [Ota] Yes. 
  [Oshima] How do you view the relationship between these two 
prominent individuals? 
  [Ota] I believe an agreement had been reached before [Ozawa] 
left the LDP. He was able to leave the LDP with confidence 
because an agreement had been reached beforehand. 
  [Oshima] Is this a case of a two-phased material and 
psychological alliance? 
  [Ota] I cannot address the material facet because I have not 
seen the evidence, but reality shows evidence of a monolith. 
Agreement on this point had been reached way back, because 
before the Shinseito was established, there was constant 
agreement in utterances by Hata, Ozawa, and the Komeito from the 
time the duo became public information. 
  [Oshima] How would you respond if one questioned you about a 
future for the LDP? 
  [Ota] At the present time, we have seven parties and one 
faction or eight parties, depending on how you count, but if the 
various non-LDP parties and factions were to unite, the LDP 
probably has no future. If the small electoral district system 
is approved, there is a strong possibility that our party will 
go from 40 percent to 30 percent of the Diet seats. If that 
happens, I feel we're not going to be able to make a recovery. 
Even if a recovery were possible, it'll probably take 10 years. 
  [Oshima] The statement that there is no tomorrow for the LDP 
reflects some degree of reality. 
  [Ota] You are right. Regaining control of the government 
will 
require fundamental change. I believe doing so is the mission of 
our particular generation. 
  [Boxed item: Representative Seiichi Ota was born 30 
October 1945 in Fukuoka city. He is currently 47 years old. His 
father Seinosuke was chairman of the Hakata Daimaru Department 
Stores. He was graduated from Keio High School and Keio 
University Economics Department and earned a doctorate in 
economics from the Keio University's Graduate School. He served 
as assistant professor in the Economics Department of Fukuoka 
University and visiting assistant professor at Brown University 
in the United States before being elected to the House of 
Representatives in June 1980. He has since been reelected five 
times from the First District of Fukuoka and is a member of the 
Miyazawa faction. 
  He has served as parliamentary vice minister of finance 
and chairman of the House of Representatives Finance Committee 
and is currently chairman of the LDP Finance Committee. As this 
background suggests, his next career objective would be to 
become minister of Finance (under the condition that the LDP 
resumes control of the government). Between himself and his wife 
Yasuko, eldest daughter of Former Fukuoka Prefecture Governor 
Kamei, he has two daughters. Among books published are 
coauthored "Summary Theory Concerning Macroeconomics" and 
jointly translated "Samuelson's Economic System." On 25 June 
1993, he formed a group to create a new LDP and became its 
representative sponsor.] 
  [Interview Postscript] The name and face of 
Dietman Seiichi Ota became known throughout the nation on 26 
July [1993], when he quickly announced himself as candidate for 
LDP president. As I watched the tall Mr. Ota announce himself 
for the candidacy with the words, "I am resolved to sacrifice 
myself for the position," I could not understand why such a 
young leader would want to take such a step. Frankly speaking, I 
asked for this interview because I wanted to seek an answer to 
that question. 
  I was able to dispel myself of the question in my own 
peculiar way as a result of that interview. I can cite as one 
factor the sympathy that he inspired among young politicians 
because of his consistent actions against Kakuei Tanaka and Shin 
Kanemaru. In essence, there is an aura about Mr. Ota. 
  Just as absurdly amicable relationships formed among 
politicians because of being in the same initial election year 
group or next door neighbors in the Dietmen's office building 
lead to unusually important factors, this aura about Mr. Ota can 
play a decisive role in determining whether he becomes a leader. 
However, future prime ministers will probably be determined on 
the basis of intellectual capacity. Sooner or later, Mr. Ota may 
just be called upon to fill that position.
