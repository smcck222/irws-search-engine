  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- Japan and the United 
States are not likely to bridge a gap over U.S. calls for 
Tokyo's setting targets for its imports of U.S.-made cars and 
auto parts until after the bilateral summit meeting in February, 
a senior trade official suggested Thursday [13 January]. 
  Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice minister for international affairs 
at 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said at a 
press conference, "there remains a gap and both sides have to 
make efforts to bridge the gap." 
  Subcabinet-level trade officials of the two countries began 
talks Wednesday on auto trade, a priority sector in the 
bilateral framework trade negotiations agreed to last July. 
  Okamatsu said he will continue talks with his U.S. 
counterpart Jeffrey Garten until Saturday and will then have 
another meeting with him late next week in Washington. 
  The vice trade ministers of the two countries will also 
discuss the issue again on January 24 and 25 in Washington and 
on February 3 to 5 in Tokyo, Okamatsu said. 
  It is necessary to have a balanced package accord when Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton meet 
in Washington on February 11, he said. 
  Okamatsu said the U.S. side is sticking to its call for some 
sort of numerical target for Japan's purchases of U.S.-made 
automobiles and auto parts, though it has changed its 
terminology to "indicators" to measure progress and results. 
  Japan rejected the U.S. demand for future benchmarks and 
instead offered criteria to assess the implementation of 
measures and policies already taken, as provided in the 
framework agreement, trade ministry officials said. 
  "Regrettably, we need wisdom to recover a trustworthy 
bilateral relationship," Okamatsu said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 14 KYODO -- Japan has yet to reach an 
accord with the United States on the opening of its construction 
market to foreign competition, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura said Friday [14 January]. 
  "I have not heard yet that an agreement was reached in 
principle," the top government spokesman told a news conference. 
"I don't think we have reached an accord." 
  Takemura's comment followed a report in Friday's edition of 
a 
leading business daily, the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN, saying that 
Washington has agreed in principle to accept an action program 
Japan will finalize possibly on Tuesday. 
  The action program will feature the introduction of an open 
bidding system for state-ordered public works projects to 
eliminate any discrimination against foreign participants in 
bidding. 
  The U.S. has threatened to impose sanctions if Japan fails 
to 
take steps to increase the openness of its construction market 
and secure greater foreign access by January 20. 
  Earlier this week, four cabinet ministers reaffirmed that 
the 
projected action plan should be designed to boost transparency, 
objectivity and free competition in Japan's construction market. 
  Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi, meanwhile, expressed 
hope that Japanese and U.S. negotiators would reach an agreement 
in the negotiations before the January 20 deadline for possible 
U.S. sanctions against Japan. 
  "Both Japan and the United States are engaged positively in 
negotiations and therefore sanctions will be avoided," he said. 
  The government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is 
scheduled to endorse the action program at a cabinet session 
Tuesday. 
  Government sources said the program features opening 
biddings 
for public works projects, allowing foreign contractors to 
participate. 
  To be opened to foreign bidders will be national projects 
exceeding 700 million yen and those of local governments worth 
more than 2.7 billion yen, they said. 
  The sources said Washington raised no objection to the 
Japanese plan during the recent informal market access 
negotiations in Tokyo.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 14 KYODO -- A senior U.S. trade 
negotiator said Friday [14 January] that the United States and 
Japan are miles apart on what the fundamental objectives are in 
their bilateral trade framework talks. 
  Jeffrey Garten, U.S. undersecretary of commerce for 
international trade, told the Foreign Correspondents' Club of 
Japan, "It is no secret that these negotiations are moving 
slowly, no secret that the U.S. and Japan are extremely far 
apart on virtually all the issues." 
  Garten said that while the U.S. is looking for ways to 
measure progress and concrete results in the opening of Japan's 
markets, Japanese negotiators want to focus on process and 
further studies, resisting the setting of any measuring criteria. 
  He said the question of measurement, however it is defined, 
is certainly seen differently by Japanese negotiators and the 
U.S. side. 
  As to auto trade, a priority sector of the framework talks, 
Garten said, "There is not even an agreement on the nature of 
the problem." 
  "We haven't moved an inch," he said, indicating 
subcabinet-level talks this week have not made any progress. 
  The U.S. side has taken up trade imbalance and the question 
of market access as the main problems, but Japanese negotiators 
have insisted that Japan's markets are open and the problem is a 
lack of effort by American companies, Garten said. 
  Garten said, however, there will be maximum effort on both 
sides to make the negotiations a success since the results in 
February will color U.S.-Japan relations for some time. 
  "This is for the (Bill) Clinton administration a first real 
sort of benchmark of U.S.-Japanese trade relations," he said. 
  He said he was not sure how the negotiations will turn out, 
but expressed hope that the pieces fall into places as they get 
close to the deadline of February 11 when Clinton and Japanese 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa meet on the issue. 
  "The history of U.S.-Japan negotiations that I know shows 
that there's a lot more progress if the top leaders get 
involved," he said.

  [Text] Washington, Jan. 13 KYODO -- Top Japanse and U.S. 
military leaders discussed North Korea's alleged nuclear arms 
development program as they met in Washington Thursday [13 
January], a visiting top Japanese military leader said. 
  Gen. Tetsuya Nishimoto, chairman of the Joint Staff Council 
of Japan's Self-Defense Forces, paid a courtesy call on Gen. 
John Shalikashvili, chairman of the U.S. joint chiefs of staff, 
at the Pentagon. 
  Nishimoto later told reporters that he discussed North 
Korea's nuclear program and other matters with Shalikashvili, 
and got the impression that "the U.S. has been negotiating very 
patiently" with Pyongyang over the nuclear issue. 
  The United States is formulating a comprehensive policy 
approach toward North Korea that focuses not only on the nuclear 
issue but also takes into account North Korea's missile 
development program, its vast military power and possible 
involvement in international terrorism, he said. 
  Nishimoto is currently on a three-day visit to the United 
States as Shalikashvili's official guest.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 14 KYODO -- The Tokyo Metropolitan 
Police Department on Friday [14 January] launched a probe into 
the suspected export of a military-related, high-tech device to 
North Korea, police sources said. 
  Police suspect a Kanagawa Prefecture-based trading company, 
specializing in deals between Tokyo and Pyongyang, exported a 
spectrum analyzer which can be converted to military use. 
  Export of the device is regulated by the Paris-based 
Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom), 
which tries to control the sale of strategically important goods 
to communist countries. 
  The spectrum analyzer can be used to improve the aiming 
precision of weapons, authorities said. 
  Police also suspect the trading firm applied to the Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry for permission to export the 
analyzer using false information, the sources said. 
  Although the device was allegedly exported to Pyongyang by 
the Kanagawa-based trading firm, the Tokyo-based maker of the 
device was not informed to which country the analyzer would be 
sent, police added. 
  The manufacturer was also not told for what purpose the 
analyzer would be used, the sources said. 
  They did not identify either the manufacturer or the trading 
firm. 
  The sources said police will question persons concerned for 
alleged violation of foreign exchange and foreign trade control 
law. 
  The YOMIURI SHIMBUN reported Friday that North Korea may use 
the analyzer for development of the intermediate-range missile 
called "Nodong-1." 
  The national daily said the spectrum analyzer is able to 
measure more precisely the distance between a missile launcher 
and a target by analyzing the rebounding of a radar beam. 
  North Korea last May successfully test-launched a Nodong-1 
missile, which has an estimated range of 1,000 kilometers.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 14 KYODO -- Police searched a small 
Yokohama-based machinery trading company on Friday [14 January] 
and questioned its officials on the firm's suspected exporting 
of military-related high-tech devices to North Korea, police 
sources said. 
  Police suspect the trading firm, specializing in deals 
between Tokyo and Pyongyang, violated the foreign exchange and 
foreign trade control law by exporting spectrum analyzers which 
can be converted to military use. 
  The company, Yokohama Machinery Trading Co., is also 
suspected of having applied to the Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry (MITI) for permission to export the analyzers 
using false information, the sources said. 
  Since a spectrum analyzer is a precision device used to 
measure the character of an electric wave, a high-efficiency one 
can be used to improve the aiming precision of weapons. 
  Exports of the device are therefore regulated by the 
Paris-based Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export 
Controls (Cocom), which controls the sales of strategically 
important goods to communist countries. 
  The analyzers, priced at about 3 million yen, were 
manufactured by an electronics maker based in Tokyo and 
allegedly exported to Pyongyang through the trading firm around 
in 1989. 
  But the maker was not informed to which country the analyzer 
would be sent and for what purpose it would be used, the sources 
said. 
  MITI Minister Hiroshi Kumagai told a press conference that 
he 
has already instructed ministry officials to investigate the 
case and deal with the situation. 
  Japan prohibits exports of weapons to the communist bloc and 
countries engaged in military strife. It is also necessary to 
receive authorization from the MITI minister before exporting 
weapons abroad. 
  Military analysts said it is possible that North Korea might 
have used the analyzers to develop the intermediate-range 
missile called "Nodong-1." 
  North Korea last May successfully test-launched a Nodong-1 
missile, estimated to have a range of 1,000 kilometers and 
therefore being capable of reaching most parts of Japan. 
  In May 1987, an Osaka-based trading firm was found to have 
illegally exported to North Korea integrated circuits and 
equipment to measure electric waves. 
  Officials of the electronics maker that manufactured the 
analyzers told reporters Friday that the firm is not to blame 
for the incident, saying the export impinges on the contract. 
  At a press conference held at its head office, an executive 
said the company sold the analyzers, set to be exported to 
China, to the trading firm in 1989. 
  The manufacturer's official in charge of trading received a 
document from the trading house that promised it would not 
violate Cocom regulations and confirmed the Chinese company 
issued the order on the analyzers, the executive said. 
  The maker, which believed the devices would go to China, is 
a 
"victim" of the plot, the executive said. 
  A Japanese Government source, meanwhile, said the analyzers 
would not have been used in the Nodong-1 missile, which the 
source said has an unsophisticated guidance system.

  Japan will also continue to back Russian reform efforts in 
cooperation with other Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized 
nations, Hata said. 
  He also gave high marks to the scheduled signing of an 
agreement among the U.S., Russia and Ukraine which is expected 
to pave the way for Kiev to scrap nuclear missiles, saying the 
accord would contribute to the world's security and that Japan 
will continue to cooperate in it. 
  Clinton and Yeltsin are due to sign the historic accord with 
Ukrainian leader Leonid Kravchuk later in the day.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- Talks between the 
Transport Ministry and Russian aviation authorities have reduced 
delays to Europe-bound flights using Siberian air space after 
several weeks of long delays imposed by the Russian side, 
Japanese officials said Thursday [13 January]. 
  Russia imposed restrictions on flights over Siberia late 
last 
year causing hefty delays for many Europe-bound passenger 
flights from Japan and South Korea. 
  Airlines experienced delays of over an hour to their 
scheduled departures from Narita Airport. 
  Russian aviation authorities said the flight restrictions, 
sent as a formal "notice to airmen" on December 28, were a 
safety measure following a deterioration in the reliability of 
radio communications equipment and would last until March 27. 
  The restrictions limited the number of civilian flights out 
of Japan and passing near Khabarovsk to a maximum of six flights 
per hour, one-third of the previous frequency. 
  Between 40 and 50 flights use this route into and out of 
Narita each day but each was obliged to await clearance from 
Russian authorities even if all passengers were on board. 
  As a result of the negotiations, the restrictions were eased 
from January 7, allowing six flights per hour from Narita alone 
and resulting in a 50 percent reduction in the average delay to 
between 30 minutes and one hour.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- Japan and Russia will 
discuss bilateral cooperation on environmental protection in 
Tokyo from January 26 to 27, Japanese Government officials said 
Thursday [13 January]. 
  Among topics are prevention of air and water pollution, 
disposal of harmful waste and preservation of Siberian forests 
to help prevent global warming, the officials said. 
  The talks are aimed at working out concrete projects for 
bilateral cooperation, they said. 
  In Russia's Far East region, about 800,000 hectares of trees 
are cut down annually, posing a threat to forests which are said 
to keep global warming in check. 
  Also part of the frozen soil in Siberia has melted recently 
to release methane gas, a substance said to promote global 
warming. 
  Japan has carried out a joint survey since 1992 to measure 
the density of methane in the air above Siberia. 
  The Japanese team at the talks will consist of officials of 
the Foreign Ministry, the International Trade and Industry 
Ministry and the Environment Agency. The Russian delegation 
will be from the Environmental Protection and Natural Resources 
Ministry. 
  The meeting will be the first on cooperation on the 
environment since Japan and the former Soviet Union signed an 
agreement on such deals when then Soviet President Mikhail 
Gorbachev visited Japan in April 1991, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- Japan and South Korea will 
hold a meeting in Tokyo next Monday to discuss bilateral 
cooperation to protect the environment, the Foreign Ministry 
said Wednesday [12 January]. 
  The meeting is the first to be held under a treaty on 
cooperation to preserve the environment signed between the two 
countries last June. 
  Japanese officials from the Foreign Ministry, the 
Environment 
Agency, the Science and Technology Agency and the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry will attend the meeting, the 
ministry said. 
  The South Korean delegation includes officials from the 
Foreign, Science and Technology and Environment Ministries. 
  The participants will discuss each nation's environment 
polices and bilateral and multilateral cooperation on 
environmental problems, it said. 
  Japan is expected to propose joint projects including 
monitoring acid rain, apparently caused by emissions from China, 
and research on pollution in the Sea of Japan, such as that 
caused by Russia's dumping of nuclear waste, Japanese officials 
said. 
  Tokyo and Seoul will also discuss South Korea's request for 
Japan to help in the recycling and disposal of industrial waste, 
the officials said. 
  The Japan-South Korea accord covers research on acid rain, 
air pollution, global warming, the preservation of ecosystems 
and biodiversity. 
  Under the agreement, the conference will be held annually, 
alternating between Japan and South Korea.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 14 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Friday [14 January] indicated his intention to visit 
China in late March for talks with Chinese leaders on bilateral 
and international issues. 
  Hosokawa made remarks to this effect in a meeting with a 
group of reporters at his official residence. 
  Asked about his travel plans following his visit to the 
United States in February to meet President Bill Clinton, 
Hosokawa said he has no alternative but to visit Japan's 
"neighboring country," taken to mean China because the premier 
visited South Korea last November. 
  In reply to a question on the timing of his possible visit, 
Hosokawa indicated it would be around March 21.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- A major Vietnamese trade 
exposition, the first of its kind ever held in Japan, will open 
in Tokyo on January 19, officials of the Japan External Trade 
Organization (JETRO) said Thursday [13 January]. 
  Officials said the exposition, aimed at enhancing trade ties 
between the two countries, will be sponsored by Jetro and the 
Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry and supported by both 
the Japanese and Vietnamese Governments. 
  It will last through January 27 and precede the holding of a 
Japanese industrial product trade fair in Hanoi next March. 
  Representatives from 25 Vietnamese companies will be 
exhibiting such potential export items as marine products, 
coffee, handicrafts, furniture and clothing. 
  According to Finance Ministry figures, Vietnamese exports to 
Japan have skyrocketed in recent years, from 196 million dollars 
in 1988 to 870 million dollars in 1992. 
  Vietnam had a whopping trade surplus with Japan of 419 
million dollars in 1992. Mineral fuels accounted for 62.2 
percent of Japanese imports from Vietnam in that year, followed 
by foodstuffs and industrial products.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- Japan is likely to resume 
extending official yen loans to Cambodia as early as this year 
after nearly 25 years of suspension, Foreign Ministry [MOF] 
sources said Thursday [13 January]. 
  The Japanese Government plans to provide the loans in 
cooperation with the World Bank to ease Cambodia's international 
balance of payments problem, the sources said. 
  The amount of the loans, however, remains undetermined, they 
said. 
  Japan last extended a 1.5 billion yen loan in March 1969. 
  The government is likely to decide on resumption of the 
loans 
after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) assesses the 
Cambodian economy in February, they said. 
  It is not clear whether Tokyo will be able to make an 
announcement on the new loans at the International Committee on 
the Reconstruction of Cambodia (ICORC) scheduled to be held in 
March, because a meeting of Paris Club creditor nations is to be 
held in April, the sources said. 
  The ICORC was set up in June 1992 at a ministerial meeting. 
At its first meeting in Paris last September, donor nations 
pledged 119 million dollars in new aid in addition to the 880 
million dollars pledged at the ministerial meeting. 
  Cambodia is estimated to owe Japan some 2.6 billion yen. The 
accumulated debt is an obstacle to Japan's resumption of yen 
loans. 
  Japan has been offering Cambodia grant-in-aids for projects 
to improve the war-torn country's infrastructure. Japan 
extended 6.12 billion yen in fiscal 1992 and 8 billion yen in 
fiscal 1993.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 15 KYODO -- The Japanese Government on 
Friday [14 January] offered its condolences to Norway over the 
sudden death of Foreign Minister Johan Holst on Thursday and 
said it will send telegrams expressing its sympathy. 
  The death of Holst, who played a pivotal role in the Middle 
East peace process, was "a great shock," said Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Sadaaki Numata, adding it is a loss not only for 
Norway but the whole world. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata and other Japanese Government officials will send telegrams 
of condolence later in the day, the spokesman said. 
  Holst, 56, who was instrumental in brokering the historic 
agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization (PLO) last Septmeber for limited Palestinian 
self-rule in the occupied territories, died after reportedly 
suffering a stroke. 
  He visited Japan last October and held talks with Hosokawa 
and Hata.

  [Text] Fukuoka, Jan. 14 KYODO -- Twenty-four men found 
hiding on a cargo ship that docked in Kyushu on Thursday night 
[13 January] are being questioned on suspicion of trying to 
enter Japan illegally, maritime safety officials said Friday. 
  They said the men, all Thais, were hiding on the 8,854-ton 
Thai-registered cargo ship Jutha-Pariyanat, which docked at 
Miike Port in Omuta, Fukuoka Prefecture, at 8 P.M. Thursday. 
None of the 24 were crew members, the officials said. 
  The ship is owned by the same Thai company whose cargo ship 
the Jutha-Jessica brought 19 Thais illegally to a port in 
Kumamoto, south of Fukuoka, without proper visas on January 5, 
they said. 
  The 19 were arrested at a railroad station in Kumamoto early 
Thursday morning for not having passports with them, along with 
two crew members suspected of helping them get ashore. 
  The officials said they are investigating the 24 found 
hiding 
on the Jutha-Pariyanat, which left Bangkok on January 4, on 
suspicion of trying to enter Japan in violation of the 
immigration law.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- Nongovernmental 
organizations (NGOs) will discuss problems resulting from the 
growing world population at a symposium from Saturday in 
preparation for a United Nations Conference on Population and 
Development in Cairo, Egypt, later this year, organizers said 
Wednesday [12 January]. 
  The symposium, which will be held at Waseda University in 
Tokyo, is co-organized by the "Peoples' Forum 2001," an NGO 
umbrella organization, and "Japan's Network for Women and 
Health," which aims at increasing women's representation at the 
Cairo conference. 
  Panelists will include Makoto Ato, head of the Health and 
Welfare Ministry's Institute of Population Problems, Assistant 
Prof. Chizuko Ueno of Tokyo University and representatives of 
the U.N. Population Fund. 
  The symposium will adopt an appeal urging the Japanese 
Government to include NGO and women representatives in its 
delegation for the Cairo conference. The suggestions will be 
submitted to the government-organized "Tokyo Wise Men's 
Conference on Population and Development," which will be held on 
February 26 and 27. 
  "Population growth in developing countries is a result of 
environment destruction by developed countries. There the 
Japanese bear responsibility too," said Shunsuke Iwasaki, 
assistant professor at Tsukuba University and head of the 
Peoples' Forum 2001. 
  "This problem is not that simple that it could be solved by 
just providing means for birth control. As the Cairo conference 
is drawing closer, we want to make the first step to give 
ordinary people a say (in these matters)," Iwasaki said in 
explaining the objectives of the symposium. 
  The U.N. holds its international Conference on Population 
and 
Development every ten years. This year's conference, from 
September 5 to 13, will adopt an action program seeking to 
establish a sustainable balance between the soaring population, 
scarce resources and an increasingly damaged environment. 
  The U.N. estimates that the world population will grow by a 
record 93 million to over 5.7 billion in 1994, with the majority 
of the growth occurring in developing countries.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 14 KYODO -- Japan's chief economic 
planner Friday [14 January] hinted at a "little" delay in 
releasing the government's additional economic stimulus package 
originally expected January 20. 
  "I can't deny the possibility of a little delay," Manae 
Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning Agency [EPA] 
told reporters after the regular morning cabinet meeting. 
  Her agency is working on the package as instructed by Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for compilation by "mid-January," 
Kubota said. 
  But she indicated the chances of delay while citing the need 
for further discussion among coalition parties and some 
uncertainties still remaining over political reform, Hosokawa's 
previously stated "top priority" for his administration. 
  Kubota said there were no questions or comments over the 
stimulus measures at the cabinet meeting. 
  Meanwhile, the Economic Planning Agency chief quoted Bank of 
Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno as saying that the recent rally in 
Japanese stock prices stems from "bargain-hunting" against 
strongly rising overseas stocks. 
  Mieno was speaking at a meeting of economic ministers held 
before the cabinet meeting. 
  On the dollar-yen exchange rates, Mieno stressed the dollar 
has recovered "half" of its losses against the yen since January 
last year with the weakening of the yen since December to the 
range of 110 to 112 yen to the dollar, Kubota said. 
  She also quoted Mieno as saying that interest rates have 
fallen to record levels, but bank lending has remained sluggish.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 14 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Friday morning [14 January] that recent movements 
in the yen's rate and share prices have been stable, though he 
said the economic situation is still severe. 
  Hosokawa made the comment in response to reporters' 
questions 
on market developments in connection with the government's 
monthly economic report, released earlier in the day. 
  The report said the nation's economy remains at the worst 
stage of the recession. 
  The dollar opened the day at 111.80 yen in Tokyo, down 0.50 
yen from Thursday's close, and the 225-Nikkei stock average, a 
key barometer on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, fell 90.91 points to 
18,486.35 in early trading.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 14 KYODO -- Japan's economy continues 
to wade through its worst stage of recession, the evidence of 
which can be seen in many areas, the Economic Planning Agency 
(EPA) said in a monthly report Friday [14 January]. 
  An agency official briefing reporters on the monthly report 
on the state of Japanese economy said the situation is severe 
and the recession is lagging on. 
  In the report, the EPA simply stated that the state of the 
economy is "overall sluggish." 
  Asked if the agency is using its gloomiest words possible to 
describe the situation, the official answered "yes." 
  The EPA pointed out that consumer spending remained 
lackluster, while the weakness of plant and equipment investment 
is spreading from manufacturers to the nonmanufacturing sector. 
  The report noted the plodding process of inventory 
adjustments and said industrial output remains stagnant. 
  The official said business conditions of private enterprises 
are worsening. He said he can no longer attribute the situation 
merely to the yen's appreciation, admitting the overall 
situation is simply "bad." 
  Job offers continued to decline, while the unemployment rate 
continues to increase, the report said. 
  The EPA said the government is hence currently working to 
compile another comprehensive pump-priming package to spur the 
economy, in addition to steady implementation of past 
stimulation programs. 
  Exports are down with effects of the yen's appreciation 
gradually appearing and because of an adjustment of the economic 
growth in China after a heated period, the official said. 
  Meanwhile, implementation of public works spending improved 
and housing starts were also solid.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 14 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii on Friday [14 January] denied reports that the Finance 
Ministry will compile a draft budget for fiscal 1994 on February 
5. 
  Speaking at a regularly scheduled news conference, Fujii 
said 
he has not heard about a specific schedule for next year's 
national budget. 
  Major newspapers reported the ruling coalition parties, at 
Thursday's meeting of their leaders in charge of policy affairs, 
decided to announce a tax reform plan for next year on February 
3 and the Finance Ministry's draft budget two days later. 
  The ministry wants to begin compiling the next year's budget 
"as soon as possible" while closely watching developments in 
Diet debate over political reform bills, Fujii said. 
  Fujii denied the United States has proposed holding a 
ministerial meeting as a way to break through stalled 
"framework" trade talks with Japan. 
  The comment came after U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor on Wednesday recommended holding such a meeting between 
the two countries before U.S. President Bill Clinton and 
Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa meet in Washington on 
February 11.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Tokyo Asahi Television Network in 
Japanese at 0148 GMT on 9 January, in its 105-minute "Sunday 
Project" talk show which begins at 0100 GMT, carries a 26-minute 
live interview with Akira Yamagishi, chairman of Rengo (Japanese 
Trade Union Confederation). He answers questions from economic 
commentator Soichiro Tawara at the Asahi Television studio in 
Tokyo. 
  Yamagishi is first asked how he rates the performance so far 
of the coalition government. 
  He says: "I would give it 70 percent." To get higher marks, 
he adds, the need for the government to discontinue 
bureaucrat-led politics. 
  He says: "At this juncture, the ruling coalition has no 
choice but to implement large-scale income tax cuts. But they 
should not carry out both the cuts and a consumption tax hike at 
the same time as one package, as the Ministry of Finance (MOF) 
proposes." 
  He believes, like the leaders of the ruling coalition 
parties, that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa also hopes to 
separate the income tax cuts from the consumption tax rise and 
implement large-scale income tax cuts. 
  He notes, however: "Bureaucrats in the MOF are preventing 
the government from doing so." 
  He thinks differences within the ruling coalition on tax 
reform are also hampering Hosokawa's attempts to make a decision. 
  Tawara points out that disunity among members of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ) is an obstacle to the formation 
of a consensus on political reform within the ruling coalition 
and asks Yamagishi how the party should act. 
  He refers to speculation the SDPJ might split or leave the 
ruling coalition following its party convention on 11 and 12 
January. 
  Yamagishi says: "I do not think this will happen. I do not 
think the SDPJ would do anything so ridiculous." 
  Asked what he thinks of moves to form new groups within the 
SDPJ, Yamagishi says: "I think that would be acceptable. The 
party will not be able to cope with the second phase of 
political realignment if it sticks to its current organization." 
  Yamagishi then begins to discuss his idea of a two-party 
system composed of a conservative party and an non-conservative 
party and notes the need for the SDPJ to lead the 
non-conservative forces. 
  Tawara asks Yamagishi what he discussed with Hokkaido 
Governor Yokomichi when he met him on 20 December. Yokomichi is 
considered likely to play a pivotal role in strengthening the 
unity of the SDPJ in the future. 
  Yamagishi says: "We shared the same views on the idea of 
realizing a two-party system composed of a conservative party 
and an non-conservative force, not a two-party system composed 
of two conservative parties. We agreed that the SDPJ, as a 
non-conservative party, should join with centrist, liberal, and 
other forces to form a large political party." 
  Asked whether Yokomichi intended to enter the national 
political arena, Yamagishi says: "I feel he will be ready to 
return to the national political scene once his tenure as 
governor expires in April 1995. This was only an impression, 
though, because he did not say so." 
  During discussions on Rengo's hopes for the non-conservative 
force Yamagishi is asked about tax reform. 
  Yamagishi says: "I strongly oppose the idea of implementing 
income tax cuts and a consumption tax hike as one package, but I 
do not oppose raising the consumption tax. It is just that I do 
not see it as necessary to have a timetable for its 
implementation. 
  Turning to the issue of economic recovery, Tawara asks 
Yamagishi what he thinks the government should do to stimulate 
the economy. 
  Yamagishi says: "I think the government has no alternative 
but to implement large-scale tax cuts worth about 10 trillion 
yen separately from raising consumption tax." 
  Yamagishi is then asked to comment on Nikkeiren (Japan 
Federation of Employers' Associations) Chairman Nagano's remarks 
that his group would this year try to secure employment by not 
pushing for wage rises. 
  Yamagishi approves of the idea of securing employment, but 
notes the need for Nikkeiren to try to increase wages as well as 
secure employment. 
  The interview ends at 0214 GMT.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 14 KYODO -- The ruling coalition is 
poised to decide next Monday [17 January] to call a January 19 
vote on the government's political reform bills in the House of 
Councillors' special committee on political reform, coalition 
sources said. 
  Ruling and opposition parties of the upper house committee 
failed Friday to agree on a timetable for voting on the 
government's political reform package, which cleared the House 
of Representatives last November. 
  Senior members of the upper house committee from both ruling 
coalition and opposition parties will meet again Monday to 
discuss the schedule after a public hearing on the political 
reform process is held that day in Tokyo, officials said. 
  Ruling parties threatened Friday to table a motion calling 
for a committee vote on the political reform bills on January 
19, as the January 29 scheduled close of the current 
extraordinary Diet session is drawing near. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who failed to legislate 
political reform bills by the end of last year as he pledged 
last August, has vowed to enact them during the parliamentary 
extension, staking his position on the renewed pledge. 
  The ruling coalition postponed the closure of the 90-day 
Diet 
session for 45 days beyond December 15 in order to achieve 
Hosokawa's target. 
  In Friday's steering committee wrangling, the coalition for 
the time being retracted the threat of forcing a vote when 
agreement was reached to hold public hearings in five cities 
outside Tokyo on Tuesday, in addition to Monday's hearing in the 
capital. 
  Public hearings are a prerequisite to putting the bills to a 
floor vote in an upper house plenary session. In the hearings, 
knowledgeable persons recommended by the ruling and opposition 
parties, respectively, express their views on the bills. 
  After Monday's public hearing in Tokyo, the coalition will 
urge the opposition camp to agree to conclude deliberations on 
the bills on Wednesday. 
  If the opposition refuses to accept the proposal, committee 
chief Yubun Ueno will decide on the schedule, exercising his 
prerogative as chairman, coalition sources said. 
  In such a case, the opposition is expected to table a 
noconfidence motion against Ueno. 
  The government's political reform bills are designed to 
replace the current multi-seat constituencies for the more 
powerful lower house with a combination of single-seat districts 
and proportional representation, as well as to tighten curbs on 
political fund-raising activities in a bid to stem repeated 
corruption. 
  The existing electoral system is believed to be a major 
cause 
of lavish campaign spending because of competition among 
candidates of the same party in single districts, while the 
current Political Funds Control Law is seen as having loopholes 
that make it possible for politicians to escape punishment for 
wrongdoing. 
  In the 252-seat upper house, the ruling coalition has 131 
seats, while the Liberal Democratic Party holds 99, the Japanese 
Communist Party (JCP) 11, the Niin Club five, and independents 
five. 
  Several upper house members of the Social Democratic Party 
[of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the largest bloc in the alliance, have 
expressed opposition to the bills and could vote against them or 
abstain, greatly weakening the coalition's chances of passing 
the bills in the upper house.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- NEC Corp. said Thursday 
[13 January] it has developed a technique to enhance the memory 
capacity of a magneto-optical disc by eight times as much as the 
current method. 
  The technique makes it possible to store data equivalent to 
some 80,000 Japanese newspaper pages or two hours of VHS-format 
video movie pictures on a magneto-optical disc which measures 13 
centimeters in diameter, the same size as a music disc, the 
company said. 
  A magneto-optical disc is based on a recording method that 
combines laser and magnetic technologies to create high-density 
erasable storage discs. Its surface is made of a magnetic 
recording material that records magnetic spots or bits using a 
laser to pinpoint them. 
  NEC's new technique combines a signal-processing technology 
called the partial response maximum likelihood (prml) method 
with a red-color data-reading laser. 
  NEC said it plans to develop products using the technique 
for 
commercial use as it can be applied to a range of multimedia 
equipment.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 14 KYODO -- The Federation of Economic 
Organizations (Keidanren) will name Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman 
of Toyota Motor Corp., as its next chairman, federation sources 
said Friday [14 January]. 
  Current chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa, 79, who completed his third 
year in the post last month, has expressed a strong wish to step 
down, the sources said. 
  The change of leadership will be proposed at a top 
officials' 
meeting of the federation on February 7, and will be formally 
approved at its regular general meeting on May 27, they said. 
  Toyoda, 68, was selected to be the eighth chairman of the 
most powerful lobby of Japanese business leaders because he is 
the head of the nation's top automaker and is well known 
internationally. 
  Also, Hiraiwa felt that Toyoda, who is 11 years his junior, 
would be able to rejuvenate the organization and eventually the 
entire business community of Japan, the sources said. 
  Toyoda, a member of the founder family of Toyota Motor, 
joined the automaker in 1952. He assumed the company's 
presidency in 1982 and became chairman in 1992. He has served 
as Keidanren's vice chairman since 1990. 
  Hiraiwa originally expected Sony Corp. Chairman Akio Morita, 
who was a vice chairman of the federation, to be his successor, 
according to the officials. 
  Morita, 72, announced his retirement from all business 
activities in early December, however, after suffering a stroke.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 14 KYODO -- A Labor Ministry advisory 
panel urged the government Friday [14 January] to ease 
restrictions on private agencies that supply temporary labor so 
as to provide wider job opportunities for workers aged 60 years 
or over, ministry officials said. 
  The officials said the appeal was contained in a report 
submitted to Labor Minister Chikara Sakaguchi by the Central 
Employment Security Council. 
  The report called for widening the scope of job categories 
from the current 16, including secretaries and interpreters, 
that such agencies are allowed to handle. 
  The report also called on the government to provide 
subsidies 
to corporations which improve working conditions for senior 
workers. 
  The recommendations include a call for the establishment of 
a 
center to help workers over 60 find jobs, the officials said. 
  They said the ministry plans to submit to the next ordinary 
session of the Diet a bill to revise a job security law to 
incorporate the proposed measures and make it mandatory for 
corporations to set the retirement age at 60 in principle.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 12 (KCNA) -- Many foreign mass 
media say that pressure and "sanctions" can never be a solution 
to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  The Vietnamese Paper NHAN DAN said although the United 
States 
threatens "economic sanctions" against the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea, none of the Asian countries want in actuality 
to see "sanctions" taken against this country as demanded by the 
United States. 
  The Nepalese Paper NEPAL NEWS noted that South Korea takes 
an 
anti-national, bellicose confrontation attitude, entreating the 
United States to set up an "international cooperation system" 
against North Korea. As a matter of fact, South Korea has no 
justification or qualification to meddle in the nuclear issue on 
the Korean peninsula, added the paper. 
  The Zairean Paper UMOJA said: The United States does not 
know of its dialogue partner. The Korean people and People's 
Army are not those who would yield to anyone's pressure. They 
are fully prepared for any event. The United States can get 
nothing from "sanctions" and pressure. 
  The Jordanian Paper AL SHAAB in a commentary said that North 
Korea, which has a staunch and self-sacrificing spirit to defend 
the sovereignty and other legitimate rights with a means of 
self- defence, can turn into a volcano destroying the "new world 
order" of the U.S. 
  The Tanzanian Paper WATU said: 
  The DPRK has turned into a powerful socialist state, 
independent, self-sustaining and self-reliant in national 
defence. So no "international sanctions" can work on this 
country. 
  The Swedish Magazine RIKTPUNKT said the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula can be settled only through DPRK-U.S. talks 
because the issue arose when the United States deployed nuclear 
weapons in South Korea and began threatening the DPRK with them.

<F P=106> ["`Civilian' Fascist's Scheme To Suppress Labor Movement" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 14 (KCNA) -- Kim Yong-sam the 
traitor told a new year's meeting of the "Economic Planning 
Board" on January 11 that precedence should be given to the 
"settlement of industrial peace" and "stabilization of payment" 
to "increase competitiveness" and that ministries and agencies 
concerned should promote "active cooperation and measures" to 
this end. 
  Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says: 
  It has become all the clearer that the "civilian" fascist, 
the "civilian" dictator who has pursued an anti- popular labour 
policy defending the privileged circles intends to totally 
stifle the labour movement this year by brandishing the fascist 
bayonet more desperately. 
  The analyst further says: 
  As for "industrial peace" cried for by Kim Yong-sam, it was 
invented by the traitor No Tae-u, the military fascist dictator 
of the "Sixth Republic," in a bid to stifle the labour movement 
by shifting the responsibility for the economic crisis of South 
Korea onto the workers. 
  With this anti-popular slogan, the Kim Yong-sam group 
attempts to categorically turn down the vital demands of the 
workers and obliterate the labour movement itself, fooling 
people into believing that the economic catastrophe is 
attributable to the "labour- management dispute" and wage hike, 
as the preceding dictators did. Stripped bare is the fascist, 
anti-popular nature of Kim Yong-sam who is trying to suppress 
and stifle the struggle of the workers by adding new methods to 
all the fascist laws and means of suppression employed by the 
successive military dictatorial regimes. 
  That day, Kim Yong-sam cried for "measures to control 
prices," saying the "vicious cycle of price hike must be 
checked" this year. This is really a shameless sophism. 
  The traitors would be well advised to act with discretion, 
well aware of their position.

<F P=106> ["Japanese Reactionaries Warned Not To Act Rashly" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 14 (KCNA) -- The DPRK Government 
and people resolutely denounce the ever-more undisguised 
anti-DPRK, anti-socialist campaign of the Japanese reactionaries. 
  The Korean people will sharply watch the campaign with high 
vigilance. We warn the Japanese reactionaries not to act rashly. 
  This warning is served by today's issue of MINJU CHOSON, the 
organ of the DPRK Government. 
  The author of the commentary titled "Don't act rashly" says: 
  The Japanese reactionaries have defined the DPRK as 
"potential enemy no.1" and "most dangerous country" and declared 
that Japan would involve itself in an emergency on the Korean 
peninsula, should it arise. This is an open revelation of their 
hostile policy. 
  They raised again the "nuclear issue" and "missile threat" 
from the beginning of the year in an attempt to justify their 
military power buildup and nuclear armament on that pretext and 
realise their ambition for overseas aggrandizement. 
  The DPRK and the United States have recently agreed to solve 
the problems for a fundamental solution of the nuclear issue on 
the Korean peninsula in a package deal at the third round of 
talks. So Japan is not requested to obtrusively make a fuss 
over the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. 
  Japan must not take issue with the peaceloving DPRK but make 
a sincere apology and compensation to the Korean people for its 
past crimes and refrain from further acts obstructive to peace 
and peaceful reunification of Korea.

  [Text] Tokyo, January 12 (KNS-KCNA) -- Chairman of the 
Association of Koreans in Japan for Peaceful Reunification Kim 
Chong-su published a statement on January 11 supporting the 
policy of national reunification reclarified by the great leader 
President Kim Il-song in his New Year address. 
  "The policy of achieving the country's reunification through 
confederacy on the three principles of independence, peaceful 
reunification and great national unity, clarified once again by 
the great leader in his New Year address, fully conforms to the 
will and interests of the whole nation and serves as a highly 
important guideline in accomplishing the cause of national 
reunification by the efforts of the nation itself," he said. 
  "The 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole 
nation is a great charter for national reunification reflecting 
the ardent desire of all the fellow countrymen to achieve unity 
and national reunification transcending differences in ideology, 
ideal and system," he said, and stressed: 
  "The Kim Yong-sam `regime' must refrain from obstructing a 
fair solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula 
through DPRK- USA talks and take the road of national 
reconciliation and unity in response to the 10-point programme. 
  "The Association of Koreans in Japan for Peaceful 
Reunification will wage a more vigorous struggle to make 1994 a 
historic year in which a new phase of national reunification 
shall be opened for founding a pan-national unified state of 
confederacy form in the 90s," he said.

<F P=106> ["Work That Made Undying Contribution To Development of </F>
Chuche-based Theory of Party Building" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 14 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN in a 
by- lined article today says that "Let Us Bring About 
Revolutionary Turn in Party Work To Meet the Requirement of the 
Present Situation", a classical work published by the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il on January 14, 1983, is a famous 
work which has made an undying contribution to a fundamental 
turnabout in the party work conforming to the requirements of 
the obtaining situation and the advancing revolution and 
development of the chuche-based theory of party building. 
  The most important idea propounded in the work is to 
continue 
to deepen the work of establishing the monolithic ideological 
system of the party and make the unity and cohesion of the party 
and the revolutionary ranks more unbreakable. 
  In the work, the dear leader expounded that to establish the 
monolithic ideological system of the party is a fundamental 
principle of building a working-class party and a permanent work 
which all the party organisations should always regard as its 
cardinal task. And he laid down questions of principle arising 
in further deepening the work of establishing the monolithic 
ideological system of the party. 
  He also indicated tasks and ways of closely rallying all the 
party members, cadres and working people around the party and 
the leader by intensifying the work with the people and stressed 
the need to strengthen party leadership over socialist economic 
construction. 
  The work emphatically urges all the officials to learn from 
the great leader's work method, which requires them to go down 
to the lower units constantly and share sweets and bitters with 
the masses, and thoroughly apply it to practice. 
  Recalling that the validity and vitality of the idea, theory 
and policies laid down in the work have been fully proved in the 
revolutionary practice in the past, the author of the article 
says: 
  The work of establishing the monolithic ideological system 
of 
the party has been further deepened, the fighting capacity and 
leading role of the party have increased remarkably and the 
singlehearted unity of the revolutionary ranks with the 
illustrious leader at the centre has been consolidated further 
still in keeping with the requirements of the developing 
revolution in which the modelling of the whole society on the 
chuche idea has developed to a new, higher stage.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 13 (KCNA) -- Songs of 
unquestioned trust in and loyalty to the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il have been created and widely disseminated in the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
  Nearly 400 songs including "Kim Chong-il, He Is Our Destiny" 
and "Comrade Kim Chong-il Is Our Supreme Commander" are edited 
in collections of songs recently issued by the literature and 
art press group. 
  "We Will Win Because You Are Leading Us," a poem dedicated 
by 
Yi In-mo, the incarnation of faith and will, to dear Comrade Kim 
Chong- il last year, was composed as a song. 
  In the poem Yi In-mo emphasizes the unshakable ideological 
conviction that as long as there is the leadership of dear 
Comrade Kim Chong-il the revolutionary cause of chuche, the 
cause of socialism, shall not perish. 
  Today the Korean people are filled with revolutionary 
optimism and conviction that as long as they are under his wise 
leadership, they are sure to win victory, no matter what ordeals 
and difficulties may crop up in their way. 
  A song "Single Heart" sings of the indomitable spirit and 
determination of the Korean people to carry their revolutionary 
cause through to accomplishment, united around the illustrious 
leader in one mind and will. 
  "Comrade Kim Chong-il Is Our Supreme Commander," "Let Us 
Uphold Our Supreme Commander With Arms" and other songs tell 
about the national pride and honor of holding in high esteem 
Comrade Kim Chong-il, an outstanding military strategist and 
ever-victorious iron-willed brilliant commander, as chairman of 
the National Defence Commission of the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea and supreme commander of the Korean People's 
Army, and about the unshakable faith and will of the People's 
Army and people to resolutely defend him with arms. 
  Many songs including "We Will Hold Comrade Kim Chong-il in 
High Esteem Forever," "Kim Chong-il, He Is Our Destiny," and 
"Long Live Comrade Kim Chong-il, Great Brilliant Commander" 
reflect the unanimous mind and will of the Korean people to 
follow with loyalty and filial piety the illustrious leader who 
takes care of and protects the destiny of the nation and its 
future and hope.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 13 (KCNA) -- The Swiss committee 
for supporting Korea's reunification published Korea-bulletin 
"Korea Is One". 
  The bulletin carries a photograph of the great leader 
President Kim Il-song receiving bereaved families of 
anti-Japanese revolutionary martyrs and introduces his 
reminiscences "With the Century". 
  In an article titled "For Nuclear-Free Korea", the bulletin 
notes that the purpose sought by the United States in its 
clamour about "nuclear inspection" is to detract the world's 
attention from its nuclear weapons in South Korea. 
  Saying that there is no ground for the DPRK to allow 
inspection of even the military base which has no nuclear 
facilities, it stresses that all the anti-imperialist 
peace-loving forces must extend support to the Korean people who 
are striving to realise the denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula, get the U.S. forces withdrawn from South Korea and 
achieve the independent and peaceful Reunification of the 
country.

  [Text] The 27th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of 
the General Federation of Trade Union of Korea [GFTUK] was held 
in Pyongyang on 12 and 13 January. The plenary session was 
attended by members and candidate members of the GFTUK Central 
Committee and chairmen of the trade unions of major plants and 
enterprises in provinces and cities. 
  The plenary discussed the task elucidated by the great 
leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song in this New Year's address, the trade union 
organizations' task to thoroughly implement the decision of the 
21st plenary session of the Sixth party Central Committee, and 
the trade union organizations' task to thoroughly implement the 
dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's recent remarks. 
  Chu Song-il, chairman of the GFTUK Central Committee, made a 
report on the first agenda item. Following this, discussions 
were held. 
  The reporter and those who participated in the discussions 
stressed: In this New Year's address and in the 21st plenary 
session of the Sixth party Central Committee, the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song summed up the brilliant victory won by our 
people in socialist construction by firmly uniting around the 
party as one mind to repel all kinds of imperialists' challenges 
and, thus, safeguarding and defending socialism of our own style. 
  They noted the fact that in the Third Seven-Year Plan period 
the might of our working class' and working people's loyalty to 
the party and the leader [suryong], that is, the might of the 
singlehearted unity of the leader, the party, and the masses was 
more clearly proven and that thanks to the promotion of the work 
of making the national economy chuche-oriented, modernized, and 
scientific the economic and material foundations of our own 
style socialism have been firmly deepened and the vitality of 
our self- reliant national economy has been demonstrated. 
  Noting that in this period the GFTUK outstandingly performed 
the honorable mission and duty as the reliable supporter and 
defender of the party, the reporter and those who participated 
in the discussions mentioned the successes registered in the 
GFTUK's work under the wise leadership of the party. They 
stressed that today the trade union organizations are faced with 
the honorable work of contributing to safeguarding and defending 
socialism of our own style and to further adding luster to it. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: We should 
consolidate and develop the successes already registered in 
socialist construction and achieve a new greater victory so that 
we cannot only add luster to the popular masses-centered 
socialism of our country, but also fly higher the banner of 
socialism of chuche. 
  The reporter and those who participated in the discussions 
stressed that the trade union organizations at all levels should 
vigorously struggle to implement the party's strategies of 
pursuing the agriculture-first, light industry-first, and 
trade-first policies in socialist economic construction while 
designating two to three years to come as an readjusting period. 
  Saying that the ideological revolution should be 
strengthened 
among trade union members, the reporter and those who 
participated in the discussions presented detailed measures to 
wage ideological indoctrination work, including indoctrination 
in the principles of the chuche idea, indoctrination in the 
greatness of the idea, indoctrination in the revolutionary 
traditions, and indoctrination in the class character, through 
various forms and methods and in a substantial manner. They then 
stressed that all trade union members should deeply master the 
greatness of the respected and beloved leader's and the leader 
comrade leader's ideologies and theories, the greatness of their 
leadership, and greatness of their features and should be loyal 
to the party and the leader [suryong] under all circumstances. 
  They also stressed the need for trade union organizations to 
vigorously organize and mobilize working class and trade union 
members into the implementation of the party's revolutionary 
economic strategies. They noted that members of the trade unions 
at all levels should vigorously wage economic propaganda 
activities and carry out mass movements, including the socialist 
emulation movement, in a substantial manner, and, thus, should 
see to it that trade union members can vigorously advance in the 
spirit of adding the speed of the battle of Chollima so that all 
plants and enterprises can overfulfill this year's national 
economic plans. 
  The reporter and those who participated in the discussions 
stressed the need for trade union members to contribute to 
further strengthening the singlehearted unity of the leader 
[suryong], the party, and the masses by enhancing the function 
and role of their organizations and to effect a new upsurge in 
socialist construction. 
  A report and discussions were made on the second agenda 
items 
at the plenary session. 
  The reporter and those who participated in the discussions 
noted that the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has recently 
elucidated the task that public organizations should further 
grasp human remolding work and the methods for its 
implementation. They stressed that functionaries of all trade 
union organizations should properly carry out ideological 
indoctrination work among trade union members in conformity with 
specific circumstances. 
  Saying that indoctrination to influence people by positive 
example is a mighty indoctrination method in line with the 
essence of the socialist society, the reporter and those who 
participated in the discussions stressed the need to strengthen 
indoctrination work through the examples set by forerunners in 
the laudable communist virtues. They also stressed that [words 
indistinct] should become a work with trade union members, the 
guidance of the organizational and ideological life of trade 
union members should be further strengthened, primary 
organizations of the GFTUK should be firmly built, and the 
movement to create model primary GFTUK organizations should be 
strengthened so that the ranks of trade unions can be further 
strengthened. 
  The reporter and those who participated in the discussions 
noted that by cherishing boundless loyalty to the party and the 
leader [suryong] and more properly carrying out human remolding 
work in conformity with the demands of the developing realities, 
all trade union functionaries should inspire revolutionary zeal 
and creative positiveness among the masses so as to achieve high 
successes in the implementation of the decision of the 21st 
plenary session of the Sixth party Central Committee. The 
session adopted a relevant decision.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 13 (KCNA) -- The fisheries of 
Korea has entered a new stage of development. 
  In the period of the third seven-year plan (1987-1993), the 
number of the fishing boats including stern strawlers of and 
above 3,750 ton class increased by more than 1,100 and the 
modernisation of aquatic products processing facilities was 
energetically pressed ahead. And a powerful drive was launched 
to expand sea culture, resulting in a considerable increase of 
its area. Thus the material and technical foundations of 
fisheries were consolidated and a prospect was opened for a 
radical boost of aquatic production. 
  The fisheries of Korea made a fast development in the '60s, 
reinforced with mother ships of above 10,000 ton class and many 
5,000-ton refrigerator transports, 3,750-ton stern trawlers and 
other kinds of fishing boats. In the decade, the bases of ship 
repair and fishing tackle production, fishing ports and aquatic 
products processing bases were streamlined on an overall scale 
and bases of sea culture were built to round off the 
departmental structures of fisheries and increase its 
independence. 
  In 1970 the aquatic output increased 236 percent, the total 
tonnage of fishing boats 409 percent and the output of frozen 
products 319 percent above 1960. 
  Large-size, modern and universal-purpose fishing boats were 
widely introduced in the period of the six-year plan 
(1971-1976), too, to increase the HP [expansion unkwown] per 
ship 1.5 times and the number of scientific and technical 
apparatuses installed in them 2 times. In that period modern 
plate-shape refrigerating factories were built at major fishing 
ports to additionally create a daily fast-freezing capacity of 
10,000 tons and cold storage capacity of 220,000 tons. The 1.6 
million-ton target of aquatic production envisaged in the 
six-year plan was fulfilled one year and seven months ahead of 
schedule. 
  The independence of fisheries was immensely increased in the 
period of the second seven-year plan (1978-1984). 
  The aquatic products processing bases were markedly expanded 
and many large refrigerating factories and storages built at 
fishing ports and consumer areas such as Pyongyang, Sinpo, 
Yukdae, Wonsan, Chongjin and Nampo. 
  The aquatic output augmented 2.2 times during the fulfilment 
of the plan. 
  Today the nation's fisheries with complete departmental 
structures is developing constantly on the basis of the latest 
science and technology.

  [Excerpts] The coordination meeting No. 1/94 of the Work 
Committee for the Development of Border Areas and National Races 
[WCDBANR] was held in a new hall of the Ministry of Defense 
Services at 1430. Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt, chairman of 
the WCDBANR and secretary-1 of the State Law and Order 
Restoration Council [SLORC] attended the meeting and delivered 
an opening address. 
  In his opening speech, he said today's meeting is the work 
committee's first meeting in 1994. He added responsible 
personnel of the work committee have held coordination meetings 
whenever it is necessary even though the work committee does not 
want to hold meetings very often. He continued and said he 
coordinated development activities for Kachin Special Region-2, 
which are to be implemented by joining hands with the Kachin 
Independence Army [KIA] -- an armed organization, with the 
chairman of the WCDBANR subcommittees. He said it has been 
nearly five years since the implementation of the development of 
border areas and national races began in May 1989. He noted 
that the implementation of development activities in the regions 
now have to be expanded for jungle-based organizations who are 
going to return to the legal fold. He continued that border 
areas and national races development activities are not the sole 
responsibility of the Ministry of Development of Border Areas 
and National Races and said all the ministries have to carry out 
these activities as if they are their main tasks. He said the 
implementation of border areas and national races development 
activities is actually the fulfillment of the three cardinal 
causes. [nondisintegration of the union, nondisintegration of 
national solidarity, and perpetuation of national sovereignty]. 
[passage omitted] 
  He then added that preparations must be made now to 
introduce 
for substitution crops for opium in the respective regions. 
When this is accomplished, the substitution crops can be 
cultivated effectively during opium growing season. That is why 
preparations are necessary to ensure the needed supply of seeds, 
saplings, machinery, fertilizer, and other equipment. [passage 
omitted] 
  Continuing, he said the state government has been carrying 
out border area development activities effectively and with 
genuine goodwill. One can see the gradual growth in urban and 
rural development when compared to the previous situation. The 
jungle- based armed organizations have realized their activities 
are not benefiting the country and local native people, and they 
also believe that the state government is really working for the 
benefit of national races in border areas. That is why, they 
are offering to hold peace talks. If the armed insurgencies 
subside in various border regions, these regions will become 
calm and the state government will be able to carry out more 
development activities than what is currently being done. 
[passage omitted] 
  He then added that we should look at the work being carried 
out to eradicate narcotic drugs in border areas. The 
destruction on 27 October of an old opium refinery and equipment 
by local natives near (Aunglankhet), (Khinpunlon) Village Tract, 
Kokang region should be hailed and documented. He noted that 
the state considers the eradication of narcotic drugs a national 
duty. This is the reason the creation of business enterprises, 
which will aim to completely eradicate the cultivation of 
narcotic drugs, was mentioned in the objectives of the Law on 
the Development of Border Areas and National Races. The law was 
proclaimed on 13 August 1993. He spoke next about the 
eradication of narcotic drugs in border areas. He said the 
state has reached an agreement on short- and long-term plans, a 
six-year plan in Kokang region and a 10-year plan in Wa region, 
with local leaders. That is why, regional work committees must 
keep a close eye on the annual reduction in narcotic drugs and 
their destruction drugs in their respective regions. [passage 
omitted] 
  He concluded his opening speech by saying that one can see 
the state leaders' goodwill for national brethren by looking at 
the amount spent for the development of national brethren. 
[passage omitted]. 
  Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt said in his closing speech that even 
though SLORC intends to carry out development activities in 
every state, priority has been given only to the poor states. 
The SLORC has realized that national development activities can 
only be carried out effectively and ultimately when there is 
national solidarity. The SLORC discussed and coordinated the 
return of jungle-based armed organizations to the legal fold to 
ensure national unity. Due to this invitation, some jungle-based 
armed organizations have made contact regarding their return to 
the legal fold. Some are holding discussions and coordinating 
at the lower level. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The oldest, most powerful Burmese guerrilla 
group will probably win the support of the rest of the 
opposition for negotiations with the military junta in Rangoon, 
the group said yesterday. 
  "We are optimistic," said Karen National Union (KNU) 
spokesman Arthur Shwe. 
  The spokesman was referring to the Democratic Alliance of 
Burma meeting in progress at Mannerplaw, the headquarters of the 
KNU, in the Karen state across the Thai border. [passage omitted] 
  At the meeting, expected to end today, Shwe said, the KNU 
intends to obtain the Democratic Alliance's support for opening 
a dialogue with the SLORC, which should begin with a ceasefire. 
  "I think there will be no problem," he said. [passage 
omitted] 
  Analysts say the possible opening of negotiations between 
the 
KNU and the SLORC is the clearest indication of the beginning of 
a thaw between the dictatorship and the opposition. [passage 
omitted] 
  Negotiations with the SLORC are in progress at Loi-Kaw, 
capital of the state of Kayah, home of the Karen's "cousins", 
the Karennis, who have also been fighting Rangoon, Shwe said. 
[passage omitted] 
  Dissident Burmese students who fled a bloody crackdown 
against democracy to join ethnic minority rebels vowed yesterday 
to press on with their war against Rangoon's junta. 
  The students were reacting to a decision of their allies to 
enter peace talks with the generals. 
  "Even if the Karen and other rebel organisations reach 
agreements with the regime we will continue our struggle because 
our goals are different," Kyaw Kyaw, 29, vice chairman of the 
All Burma Students Democratic Front (ABSDF) told reporters at a 
jungle camp on the Thai-Burmese border. 
  "The ethnic minority rebels have been fighting for their 
autonomy but we students are fighting for democracy throughout 
Burma," he said. 
  Another pro-democracy dissident said they would never 
abandon 
efforts to free Burma's detained opposition leader Aung San Suu 
Kyi.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jan 14 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia and 
Singapore Friday agreed to expedite efforts to realise the East 
Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC), and they did not rule out the 
possibility of seeing the caucus formed this year, Foreign 
Minister Abdullah Haji Ahmad Badawi said Friday. 
  He said Singapore, a party committed to the concept, 
understood the need to realise the caucus in the very near 
future in the light of the conducive atmosphere both inside and 
outside the region. 
  Obstacles are no longer there, more so with the change of 
Washington's stand (on the matter) and that of Tokyo's, he told 
reporters after a 90-minute meeting with Singapore Foreign 
Minister Professor S. Jayakumar who arrived here this morning on 
his first visit to Malaysia. 
  We like to see EAEC taking shape this year itself, he said, 
adding that the ASEAN Secretariat in Jakarta was working towards 
it. 
  He said Prof. Jayakumar agreed that given the present 
circumstances, there was no reason for the caucus not to be 
realised soon. 
  Abdullah said he hoped that the working relationship between 
Kuala Lumpur and Singapore need not be too formal and that the 
cordial ties should also be enhanced down the line, especially 
at the officials level. Being neighbours, Ablullah said, a 
good relationship between the officials was vital to further 
maintain the long-standing bilateral ties.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jan 13 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Malaysia is 
disappointed that Israel is deliberately delaying transfer of 
power to the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and Jericho on the 
West Bank, Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Thursday. 
  Malaysia hoped Israel would be sincere and committed to the 
peace agreement which it signed on Sept 13 with the Palestine 
Liberation Organistion (PLO) giving limited self rule in the two 
areas, he said. 
  The new year has come and a Palestinian government should 
have been in place in the two areas, he told reporters before 
giving a cheque for RM13.6 million (about U.S. $5 million), 
being a donation from the Government of Malaysia, to Palestinian 
Ambassador Ahmad al- Farra, here. 
  Malaysia hoped the agreement would be implemented as soon as 
possible, he said. 
  He said Malaysia would continue to support the aspirations 
of 
the people of Palestine to have their own independent homeland 
with Jerusalem as the capital. 
  Abdullah said Malaysia was the first country to give direct 
financial aid to the Palestine National Council authority to 
develop the Gaza Strip and Jericho when the two areas were 
returned to the Palestinians. 
  The donation represented Malaysia's fulfillment of a pledge 
to the PLO to help it redevelop the two areas, he said. 
  Malaysia is also ready to give all necessary aid to 
Palestine 
in the development of its human resources and institutions under 
its technical cooperation programme, he said. 
  Ahmad al-Farra said the financial aid reflected Malaysia's 
strong support for the Palestinian cause. 
  He said there were four main factors which had stalled the 
transfer of power in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
  The factors were related to the side of the area in Jericho 
to be turned over to the Palestinians, who is to administer the 
border area between Jericho and Jordan and the Gaza Strip and 
Egypt, security for the Jewish community in Gaza Strip and the 
question of Jerusalem.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jan 14 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia 
assured China Friday that its relationship with Taiwan is 
strictly economic, saying it would not do anything to harm Kuala 
Lumpur-Beijing ties. Recognising the one China policy, Malaysia 
was exercising its right as a business partner to hold talks 
with Taipei, one of its major investment and trading nations. 
  We understand Beijing's sensitivity over the China-Taiwan 
policy and we want them to know that we are aware of it, 
Abdullah told reporters after meeting Singapore Foreign Minister 
Professor Jayakumur at Foreign Ministry here. 
  Abdullah was responding to China's warning to Malaysia (and 
Singapore) Thursday for hosting a private visit by Taiwanese 
Premier Lien Chan which, it claimed, had overstepped the mark of 
approved contacts with the nationalist island. 
  China Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin yesterday 
claimed 
that countries which have dilpmmatic relations with Beijing had 
gone beyond non-governmental contacts with nationalist Taipei. 
  Abdullah said that Beijing should also understand that 
Taipei 
was an economic entity with which Malaysia has been having good 
relations over the years. 
  Malaysia is a good friend of China's, he said, adding that 
it 
would never bo anything detrimental to the relationship. 
  Abbullah said there had been no official protest from 
Beijing 
over the visit two weeks ago which was the first since 1974. The 
premier visited Singapore later. 
  Malayia severed diplomatic relations with Taipei 20 years 
ago 
after it recognised China under the so-called one China policy

  [Text] Jakarta, Jan 14 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- President Suharto 
has offered a Super Puma helicopter used by the presidential 
palace to Malaysia for the use of Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir 
Mohamed and his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim; 
  The offer was made by Suharto when Anwar paid a courtesy 
call 
on him yesterday in conjunction with his two-day visit here, 
Anwar told Malaysian reporters Friday. 
  The offer is very touching indeed, he said before leaving 
for 
home in an RMAF [Royal Malaysian Air Force] aircraft. 
  Malaysia bought a Super Puma from Industri Pesawat Terbang 
Nusantara (IPTN) [National Aircraft Industry] in 1989 for VIP 
use. 
  The helicopter crashed in Sungai Petani, Kedah, two weeks 
ago 
while on its way to pick up Anwar in Kangar. 
  Science, Research and Technology Minister B.J Habibie, who 
heads the IPTN, also offered to provide the crew for the 
aircraft. 
  Anwar said Habibie felt that initially, the Indonesian crew 
might be useful. 
  He said he informed Suharto and Habibie that the offer was 
very touching and Malaysia welcomed it. 
  Anwar said he would brief Dr. Mahathir on the offer for 
follow up action.

  [Text] A major review of laws will be conducted by the Law 
Ministry and the Attorney-General's [A-G] Chambers to provide 
adequate legal infrastructure to support Singapore's drive to go 
regional. 
  They will, when appropriate, adopt international conventions 
and model laws which harmonise and facilitate international 
trade and dispute settlements. 
  In his addendum to the President's Address released 
yesterday, Law Minister S. Jayakumar said commercial laws will 
be reviewed and modified where necessary to create a "more 
predictable legal environment" for businesses to operate. 
  He also cited two priorities in law reform: patents and 
bankruptcy. 
  New laws will be introduced to upgrade the current patent 
system and make it more convenient for Singaporeans to obtain 
patent protection for their inventions. 
  The ministry plans to change the current requirement that 
Singaporeans must first have patent protection in the United 
Kingdom before their inventions can be protected here. 
Singaporeans will instead be allowed to file applications for 
patents locally. 
  On bankruptcy, laws will be introduced to improve the 
administration of the affairs of bankrupts, and to protect 
creditors' interests without stifling entrepreneurship. 
  "We will strike a fair balance between the interests of the 
debtor, the creditor and society," he said. 
  There will be greater accountability of bankrupts in the 
administration of their estates on the one hand, and speedier 
discharges of bankrupts on the other. 
  He said the ministry will review other Acts of Parliament 
which rely on English law. This follows the enactment of the 
Application of English Law Act 1993, which makes Singapore's 
commercial law independent of future legislative changes in the 
UK. 
  Legislation will also be introduced to abolish all appeals 
to 
the Privy Council, a move announced by Chief Justice Yong Pung 
How on Saturday. 
  The Registry of Land Titles will convert all lands from the 
common law to the land titles registration system. It will also 
computerise the Land Titles Register to handle more land 
transactions and public searches. 
  Finally, the A-G's Chambers will provide better legal advice 
to ministries and government departments by centralising 
services in its civil division.

Majesty [H.M.] King Norodom Sihanouk, good health, longevity, 
and happiness. 
  3. During the visit H.E. Chuan Likphai and delegation laid 
wreaths at the independence monument and visited many important 
cultural and historic centers in Phnom Penh City and in Siem 
Reap Province. H.E. Chuan Likphai and H.E. Hun Sen presided 
over the opening of National Route 5 between Poipet and Sisophon 
which was repaired and restored by the Royal Thai Government. 
  H.E. Chuan Likphai and H.E. Hun Sen also took part in 
inaugurating the friendship bridge at Khlong Loek-Poipet, which 
was funded by the British Government and built by the Royal Thai 
Government. 
  4. The official talks between the delegation of the Royal 
Thai Government led by H.E. Chuan Likphai and that of the RGC 
led by Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and H.E. Hun Sen were 
held on 12 January at the prime ministers' office. 
  The talks went on in an atmosphere of friendship, mutual 
understanding, and cooperation. 
  5. The Cambodian side welcomed the first official visit to 
Cambodia by the Thai prime minister and noted the importance of 
this visit, which opens a new page in the two countries' 
relations. The Thai side expressed its admiration for the warm 
welcome and the cordiality offered by the Cambodian side. 
  6. The Thai side congratulated H.M. King Norodom Sihanouk on 
the occasion of his accession to the throne and highly valued 
his leading role in contributing to the development of peace and 
national reconciliation in Cambodia. 
  7. The two sides noted that the end of the cold war has 
brought an atmosphere that increases mutual understanding and 
cooperation among nations in Southeast Asia. 
  8. The Thai side welcomed and voiced strong support for the 
establishment of a new democratic Cambodian Government. The 
Thai side praised the RGC's continued efforts aimed at bringing 
about genuine national reconciliation in accordance with the 
lofty initiative of H.M. King Norodom Sihanouk. 
  9. The Cambodian side expressed gratitude to the Thai people 
for their firm and constant support for the peace process in 
Cambodia and the constructive role in the successful 
implementation of the Paris peace agreement. 
  10. The Thai side informed the Cambodian side that for the 
1993-94 fiscal year, the Royal Thai Government has provided 30 
million baht to assist Cambodia, particularly to develop human 
resources and technical assistance in various fields such as 
public works, public health, agriculture, vocational training, 
education, banking, civil aviation, science, and technology. 
  The Cambodian side thanked the Thai side for providing this 
assistance. 
  11. The two sides expressed satisfaction at the current 
situation of relations betwen the two countries and reaffirmed 
their determination to constantly and concretely heighten 
bilateral relations on the basis of mutual interest and respect 
for each other's independence, sovereignty, and territorial 
integrity, and noninterference in each country's internal 
affairs. 
  12. With the aim of promoting trade and investment, the 
Cambodian side reaffirmed its policy to respect all legitimate 
contracts signed between Thai businessmen and the Cambodian side 
and by Cambodian businessmen with the Thai side. 
  In cases of unclear trade contracts, the Cambodian side 
informed that it will properly reexamine those contracts without 
bias. While waiting for changes to be made to them, discussions 
will be held with relevant Thai businessmen aimed at ensuring 
legitimacy and mutual benefit for all sides. 
  Responding the Cambodian side's request, the Thai side 
agreed 
that the Cambodian side will export 10,000 tonnes of soybeans 
until July 1994. 
  13. The two sides exchanged views on expanding bilateral 
relations and agreed that potential for broad cooperation rests 
on aquatic products, joint development of the coast, and tourism. 
  Criminal and illegal activities by individuals or armed 
groups along the Cambodian-Thai border, which affect the two 
countries' security, will be seriously dealt with. In this 
sense, an agreement on the establishment of a joint commission 
for Cambodian-Thai bilateral cooperation was signed by the two 
countries' foreign ministers. The two side also agreed to set 
up a joint Cambodian-Thai committee on boundary at an 
appropriate time. 
  14. The two sides agreed in principle that the royal visit 
to be made by H.M. King Norodom Sihanouk to the KOT will expand 
the existing close and happy relations between Cambodia and 
Thailand. The date and the agreement on this visit will be 
communicated through diplomatic channels. 
  15. The two sides welcomed the results of the visit to the 
KOC by the Thai Prime Minister, which is an important basis in 
the history of good relations between the two countries. The 
two countries also welcomed regular exchanges of visits by the 
two countries' leaders, which will promote and heighten the 
bilateral relations. The two sides also agreed to increase such 
visits in the future.

  [Excerpts] Thailand and Cambodia yesterday set up a 
general framework for bilateral cooperation and put on record 
their agreement in principle to work toward a specific mechanism 
for dealing with boundary issues. 
  The general framework, the Joint Commission, was set up 
under 
an agreement signed by Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri and his 
Cambodian counterpart Prince Norodom Sirivut. 
  Agreement in principle to set up a "Joint Committee on 
Boundary" was recorded in a joint communique signed by Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai and Cambodian co-prime ministers Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen. 
  The Joint Commission is expected to hold its first meeting 
later this year in Bangkok, according to a delegation source. 
  It remains unclear at this point whether the Joint Committee 
on Boundary will come under the umbrella of the Joint 
Commission, the source said. 
  But the boundary committee will deal specifically with 
questions of borderline by land and sea, he said. 
  The boundary committee was proposed by Thailand in a bid to 
stem future border problems. 
  "The Joint Boundary Committee will provide an opportunity 
for 
both sides to make direct contact at all levels if problems 
arise," said the source. [passage omitted] 
  Cambodian Defence Minister Tie Banh emphasised the 
importance 
of reaching a fair agreement on sharing resources such as gas 
and oil. 
  Fisheries so far have caused "minimal conflict" but 
authorities from both countries should try to prevent any 
deterioration, he said. 
  Issues involving the land boundary he said, were more 
difficult to settle at this stage because some areas remained 
beyond control. 
  He argued for better roads linking remote areas, saying 
"when 
(we) have routes, all things will follow, including trade and 
public health". 
  "But this needs a lot of money, tools and human resources. 
It's not very easy for a poor country like ours to talk about 
much money," he said. 
  Gen Tie Banh also noted that a permanent checkpoint between 
Klong Luek and Poipet would be declared open "very, very soon". 
In the way are technical details on customs and immigration. 
  Customs procedures are important to the transfer of logs, 
including those in Khmer Rouge zones, to Thailand, a source 
said. But the Cambodian government is not expected to extend the 
March 31 deadline for the transfer of felled logs. 
  "They are more interested in joint ventures with foreign 
logging companies after the deadline expires," said the source. 
  Gen Tie Banh said permanent checkpoints between Klong Yai 
and 
Koh Kong, further south, and Chong Chom and Chong Anma, further 
north, were also under consideration. [passage omitted] 
  The Joint Commission with Cambodia follows similar 
frameworks 
for cooperation with Laos and Vietnam. 
  Under a Thai Foreign Ministry proposal approved by Cabinet, 
the Joint Commission with Cambodia is designed to facilitate 
consultation and cooperation for mutual benefit in matters of 
trade, science and technology, and social issues. 
  The Joint Commission is to meet once yearly in alternate 
capitals and the agreement will be valid for five years.

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai says foreign 
investors should steer clear of short-term ventures that unduly 
exploit Cambodians. 
  "Investment should be based on mutual interest with no 
exploitation and it must be in line with the direction and the 
interests of the people who own the country," he told more than 
200 Cambodian officials and Thai businessmen at a seminar on 
investment in Cambodia. 
  The seminar, entitled New Dimension of Cambodia's Investment 
and Environment, is organised by the Board of Investment and the 
Thai Embassy. It is the first major seminar since the formation 
of the elected Cambodian Government. [passage omitted] 
  Mr Chuan, accompanied by a large delegation of public and 
private sector officials, arrived on Wednesday for what embassy 
officials called an "historic visit" aimed at boosting the often 
troubled relations between the two neighbouring kingdoms. 
  The visit was to focus primarily on trade, which the premier 
said had "expanded rapidly from around $600,000 in 1988 to $183 
million in the first half of 1993". [passage omitted] 
  He said more than 10,000 million baht had been invested by 
Thais in Cambodia and this showed they had great interest in 
Cambodia. [passage omitted] 
  "We want to see the good investors drive out the bad." 
  The deputy governor of the National Bank of Cambodia said 
the 
Khmer Government did not control money transfers and foreigners 
were free to transfer their profits. 
  Companies have to pay 20-30 percent income tax. The 
Government will waive it for four years starting from when the 
company makes a profit and waive import duty on materials and 
machinery for export- oriented projects. 
  Federation of Thai Industries president Chokchai Aksaranan 
called on the Cambodian Government to have a clear-cut policy on 
trade and investment. 
  "The policy must be clear and transparent and must not be 
changed so often," he said.

<F P=106> [By Romy Tangbawan] </F>
  [Text] Jose Maria Sison, exiled leader of the Communist 
Party of the Philippines (CPP) yesterday accused the Ramos 
administration of "coddling (party) renegades" and threatened to 
pull out of the peace talks unless such "reprehensible" act is 
stopped. 
  "There are glaring indications that they (renegades) are 
being manipulated for a scheme of bloody intrigue," Sison said 
in a statement faxed to media outfits in Manila from the 
National Democratic Front (NDF) International Office in Utrecht, 
The Netherlands. 
  The statement named the renegades as Romulo Kintanar, Arturo 
Tabara, Filemon Lagman, and Ricardo Reyes, who are all facing 
criminal charges before the party for allegedly committing acts 
inimical to the interest of the movement. 
  Sison claimed that the NDF international office has received 
information that the four "renegades" use firearms and 
bodyguards provided by the government. 
  It said the four, under the supervision of military 
intelligence officers, have been holding caucuses and other 
activities in Metro Manila since September 1992 with the goal of 
"decapitating, discrediting, disintegrating and destroying" the 
movement. 
  Kintanar, alias Daniel Bagani or Dan, was the former chief 
of 
the New People's Army; Tabara, alias Victor del Mar, Pol, and 
Piloy, used to head the CPP Central Visayas Commission; Lagman 
also known as Carlos Forte and Popoy, heads the breakaway CPP 
Manila-Rizal Regional Committee; Reyes was former deputy 
secretary-general of the CPP-Mindanao Commission. 
  Kintanar, in particular, is being blamed by the CPP-NPA of 
introducing "gangsterism" in the movement in Davao City in 1984, 
"abuse of authority," and corruption within some party units. 
  Sison expressed concern that the four ex-rebel chiefs have 
been "openly and freely" operating in Metro Manila and 
"misrepresenting" themselves as CPP leaders despite the fact 
their expulsion from the party had been made public. 
  Sison hinted that Malacanang may not have sanctioned such 
scheme, pointing out that there are military and police 
officials who have been overruled by their superiors but who 
continue to disagree with the policy of "condoning, arming and 
funding criminal elements who have committed random killing of 
military and police officers, mass murders [sentence as 
published]." 
  But he said the "U.S.-Ramos regime cannot escape 
responsibility for any crime of intrigue committed by its 
military personnel and its Balweg-type assets against the 
patriotic and progressive forces in the Philippines." 
  Sison reminded the president, whom he addressed by his 
former 
military title "General Ramos," that similar tactics were 
applied by past administrations using the "Lava revisionists," 
"Kumander [Comrade] Melody," "Kumander Pusa," and rebel priest 
Conrado Balweg against the movement but all have failed. 
  Sison first threatened to withdraw his group from the peace 
talks after assassins killed Vicente Martinez, another former 
NPA chief, at his house in Antipolo, Rizal last week. The CPP 
described the slaying as an attempt to spark killings within the 
movement. 
  Partisans loyal to Lagman's group have blamed Sison's 
faction 
for the killing but sources from the mainstream movement said 
there is no reason for them to want Martinez killed since he is 
not among the renegades. 
  Sison suspected that government forces were behind the 
killing.

  [Excerpt] First Army Commander Chettha Thanacharo 
yesterday played down a comment by a Cambodian Information 
Ministry spokesman that there were still "bad seeds" in the Thai 
military who continue to support the Khmer Rouge. 
  "If he wants to speak, let him do so. But I believe in the 
truth. The world knows it is not possible for us to still 
support the guerrillas," Chettha said. 
  Spokesman Sieng Lapresse attacked Thai military recently in 
the Phnom Penh press, which quoted him as saying that some Thai 
military officers were against the government's stated policy 
not to support the Khmer Rouge. 
  "They have a bad Thai military (element) in there that 
supports the Khmer Rouge against Thai policy. Let's get the bad 
seeds out of there," Sieng said. 
  Chettha said the government and the military have made it 
clear that they stopped providing arms to the Khmer Rouge after 
the Paris peace accords were signed in 1991. 
  Thailand, instead, had played a vital role in restoring 
peace 
to the beleaguered country. 
  "We always assist the legitimate government. But they still 
dig up the past. We can't stop them from rnaking such 
comments," he said. 
  Chettha expressed confidence that Cambodian criticism and 
suspicions would cease as a result of Prime Minister Chuan 
Likphai's current trip to Phnom Penh. He urged the public to 
put its trust in the govemment. 
  He also called on the press to understand Thailand's 
position 
and help boost understanding. He said Thailand had made many 
contributions to Cambodia, including building infrastructure and 
schools. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan yesterday also 
insisted that the Thai military had stopped providing assistance 
to the Khmer Rouge. 
  "All branches of the armed forces have confirrned to me that 
they no longer support the Khmer Rouge. Once such an assistance 
was given. But now it is an old issue," said Banyat. [passage

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai is currently on the 
second day of his official visit to Cambodia, scheduled for 
12-14 January. At the beginning of the visit, certain senior 
Cambodian officials, during separate interviews, spoke on 
Thai-Cambodian relations in a negative way. In the latest 
incident, the spokesman of the Cambodian Information Ministry, 
Sieng Lapresse, made an observation to the media on the support 
by some Thai military officials for the Khmer Rouge. 
  On this issue, Rawi Hongpraphat, the deputy director of the 
Foreign Ministry's Information Department and deputy ministry 
spokesman, said that he did not wish to make a rebuttal, adding 
that the prime minister's visit clearly demonstrated Thailand's 
stand: that is, Thailand wanted Cambodia to be confident in the 
former's attitude toward it, and it wanted to further strengthen 
relations with the Cambodian Government. 
  To date Thailand has displayed its sincerity, Rawi said. 
Therefore, he could not understand the reason for the repeated 
negative news. If there was anything Cambodia had wanted to 
know, it could have made inquiries through the Thai Embassy, as 
agreed upon by both sides concerning the dissemination of 
information and news conferences. 
  In any event, the deputy foreign ministry spokesman is 
confident that the prime minister's visit will promote a good 
climate and provide direction for Thai-Cambodian relations. 
This is because support for the Khmer Rouge is not the policy 
of the Thai Government or a basis of operations of the Thai 
armed forces. If there are allegations about any involvement by 
Thai military officials without the knowledge of the armed 
forces, it is the duty of the armed forces to investigate.

  [Text] Deputy Foreign Ministry Spokesman Rawi Hongpraphat 
yesterday rejected suggestions that Saudi Arabia had reopened 
its door to Thai workers. 
  Lt Rawi's comment followed a report from a government MP 
early last month that Saudi Arabia would offer 60,000 jobs to 
Thai workers. 
  At about the same time, Saudi Arabian Charge d'Affaires 
Mohamed Said Khoja said Thai workers were welcome to apply for 
visas to go to his country. 
  Riyadh has stopped issuing visas to Thai workers since 
relations soured some four years ago following the murder of 
three Saudi embassy staffers and a businessman in Bangkok as 
well as the theft of jewels from the Saudi royal palace. 
  According to Lt Rawi, no clear-cut policy on Thai workers 
has 
emerged from Riyadh, where two separate ministries--Home Affairs 
and Labour-- deal with questions of visas and work permits. 
  Lt Rawi also noted that wages in Saudi Arabia had dropped 
significantly, with workers from India, Pakistan and the 
Philippines being paid only half the amount that Thai workers 
used to earn.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 14 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government, trying to decide what to do about imported rice, is 
studying the possibility of selling it to North Korea, which is 
said to be suffering a food shortage. 
  South Korea is expected to open its rice market to imports 
under the Uruguay Round agreement, but as imported rice will 
have an adverse effect on the nation's farmers, the government 
has been considering using foreign rice to make rice wine or 
other products such as rice cookies for export. 
  Government officials said Friday [14 January] that although 
South Korea is self-sufficient in rice, it is forced to import 1 
percent of the nation's rice consumption, or 50,000 tons, a year 
from 1995 under the Uruguay Round agreement. 
  The government has already decided not to sell imported rice 
on the domestic market. 
  One senior government official said that the Economic 
Planning Board, Foreign Ministry and Agriculture-Fisheries 
Ministry are actively debating problems, including the method of 
imports and the uses of foreign rice. 
  Since the Seoul government regards transactions with North 
Korea as internal trade and the amount of imported rice is 
small, it believes that there is no problem under international 
trade regulations, the official said. 
  South Korea exported 5,000 tons of rice through a private 
company, Chonji Trading, in July 1991.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Yi Myong-hwa] </F>
  [Text] The National Unification Board (NUB) has been 
undergoing subtle but significant changes with the arrival of 
new Deputy Prime Minister and Unification Minister Yi Yong-tok 
last December. 
  Unlike his predecessor Han Wan-sang, who was criticized for 
being a "sentimental unification proponent," Yi is voicing his 
negative opinions on North Korea, especially on human rights 
conditions there. 
  Yi, 68, seems fully aware of the hardships Han faced during 
his 10-month-long tenure. Former Unification Minister Han was 
frequently criticized by conservatives within the government and 
the National Assembly for his sympathetic posture toward the 
North and was finally dropped from the new cabinet lineup. 
  "So far, the new deputy prime minister is doing a fine job, 
coordinating the views of the NUB, the Foreign Ministry, and the 
Agency for National Security Planning on inter-Korean issues," 
an NUB official said. 
  Opposition lawmakers and some government officials, however, 
expressed deep concern over Yi's hard-line stance on North 
Korea, especially concerning his recent remarks on the North 
Korean human rights situation. 
  Early this month, Yi told reporters that it's about time 
North Korea recognized universal values, such as respect for 
human rights and welfare, raising the possibility that Seoul 
will take up the matter when inter-Korean dialogue resumes. 
  "North Korea must also ride the global trend of 
reconciliation and co-prosperity, and for this we must tell the 
North Koreans things that may sound harsh to their ears," Yi 
said firmly in his first message to the public as unification 
minister. 
  Noting that the most important human rights problem facing 
both South and North Korea is the issue of separated family 
members, he said it is shameful for all Koreans that these 
people still do not know whether their beloved are alive or not. 
  "Meetings alone are no longer enough, we must make this 
relationship move forward to a higher goal," he said. "If they 
don't agree on our principle, we won't respond unconditionally 
to their proposal for a meeting." 
  Since then, Yi has faced sharp criticism from opposition 
lawmakers and the press, who fear his remarks might over-shadow 
the ongoing nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang, now 
seemingly near a conclusion. 
  Rep. Cho Sun-sung of the main opposition Democratic Party, a 
well-known expert on international affairs, accused Yi of having 
"acted counter to common sense" by making the remarks, that 
would be of no help for improving South-North relations at this 
sensitive time. 
  Rep. Han Kwang-ok, a member of the party Supreme Council, 
asserted that Yi's statement put in doubt his desire to achieve 
national unification. 
  Yi again echoed the importance of change on the part of 
North 
Korea Jan. 11. During his visit at the Office of Five Provinces 
of North Korea, located in downtown Seoul, he asserted that it 
is high time for the North to change. "Unification will be 
realized only after North Korea becomes different," he said. 
  Yi further said if he met North Koreans in near future, he 
would describe to them the future unified Korea with respect for 
personal rights, guarantee of freedom and flow of justice, and 
ask them to make efforts to achieve making it. 
  The NUB under Yi's leadership is reportedly studying 
multi-prong ways to address to the human rights conditions of 
North Korea step by step in the future. 
  In initial stage, according to the NUB sources, the 
government plans to call for improved human rights conditions in 
the North in cooperation with international human rights 
organization like the Amnesty International and the 
International Committee of the Red Cross. 
  Through these organizations, Seoul would ask Pyongyang to 
allow, for example, visits by human rights inspectors and to 
stop torture and all other forms of maltreatment of prisoners. 
  On this stage, efforts could be made to resolve the 
dispersed 
family question on a priority basis without linking it to 
political questions, the sources said. 
  But some NUB officials complained the new unification 
minister puts "too much emphasis" upon the resolution of the 
dispersed families problem. They feared that the NUB might end 
up as an agency dealing with personnel and commodities exchanges 
between the two sides, if Yi continues such policy. 
  They say that Yi, a native of Kang-so, South Pyongan 
Province, now in North Korea, who himself was separated from his 
family during the 1950-53 Korean War, appears too personally 
involved with the dispersed family issue. 
  Taking issue with Yi's recent remarks, North Korea strongly 
warned Jan. 7 that inter-Korean relations will fall into 
critical condition if Unification Minister Yi repeats such 
remarks. 
  North Korea insisted that the South has tried to heat up 
confrontation between the South and the North by newly raising 
the issue of human rights in North Korea. It even threatened 
that the new unification minister of the South will never be 
allowed to set foot inside the North. 
  Estimates on Yi's moves may vary but most people seem to 
agree the human rights situations in North Korea would be a main 
topic in inter-Korean negotiations in the not too distant future.

  [Text] Washington, Jan. 13 (YONHAP) -- The Clinton 
administration's willingness to accept North Korea's offer of a 
one- time inspection of seven out of nine identified nuclear 
sites only emboldens North Korean leader Kim Il-song, a 
conservative think-tank said Thursday [13 January]. 
  The U.S. Government's agreement with North Korea on the 
nuclear inspection leaves America's Asian allies wondering 
whether U.S. security assurances are reliable, Seth Cropsey, the 
director of the Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center, said. 
  The Clinton administration should make no more concessions 
at 
the negotiating table, Cropsey said. 
  Instead, it should inform North Korea that if it does not 
allow full international inspections of all its nuclear sites on 
a regular basis by Feb. 1, the United States will ask the U.N. 
Security Council for economic sanctions the following day, he 
said. 
  The Clinton administration has already erred by postponing a 
diplomatic confrontation in the U.N. Security Council, where the 
issue of sanctions against the Kim regime should be raised, 
Cropsey said. 
  "North Korea now realizes President Bill Clinton suffers 
from 
lack of nerve, yielding to the apparent implacability of an 
armed tyrant demonstrates vulnerability," Cropsey said. 
  "It can only lead to more North Korean evasion, excuses, 
delaying tactics and in the end aggression -- perhaps nuclear 
aggression." 
  Even worse, he said, "By placing two North Korean nuclear 
sites beyond the reach of international inspectors, the 
compromise leaves the way open for Kim to continue his 
weapons-building program." 
  The compromise also abandons Washington's reasonable 
expectations that North Korea will allow regular inspections as 
set forth in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, he said. 
  Cropsey, a former high-ranking U.S. Defense Ministry 
official, recommended that the United States seize the 
initiative in Asia with a number of bold steps. They include: 
  -- Lift the trade embargo against Vietnam to demonstrate to 
North Korea that Americans are magnanimous to former foes. 
  -- Increase pressure on Japan to reduce the flow of funds -- 
at least 600 million U.S. dollars a year -- from Korean 
residents in Japan who send desperately needed hard currency to 
North Korea. 
  -- Promise more favorable terms to China as a means to 
enlist 
Beijing's help in putting economic pressure on Pyongyang. 
  -- Hold a naval military exercise in the western Pacific to 
remind Kim Il-song how quickly America can move military forces 
over a long distance.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 14 (YONHAP) -- The Korea Maritime 
Institute (KMI) said Friday it has accepted a proposal by the 
Chinese State Planning Commission's Institute of Comprehensive 
Transportation for a joint study of traffic and transportation 
in Northeast Asia. 
  Experts from the two institutes will discuss details of the 
study of transportation of cargo between South Korea and China 
and developing transportation networks in inland China in 
Beijing this month. 
  Effective transportation by air, sea and land between the 
two 
countries, and the development of a better transportation system 
in China are the aims. 
  China will hand necessary materials to KMI, which will share 
the experience that Korea has with economic development since 
the 1960s. 
  Seoul has a deep interests in expanding the shipment of 
cargo 
to Europe via the trans-China railroad and in building a rail 
link between Korea and China after unification of the Korean 
peninsula. 
  Korean and Chinese experts agree that a satisfactory traffic 
system does not exist in Northeast Asia, unlike Europe, so a 
joint study is necessary, KMI researcher Chong Pil-su said, and 
the joint study on traffic between Korea and China should be 
expanded to all Northeast Asia. 
  The Institute of Comprehensive Transportation, built in 
1959, 
is the largest transportation research institute in China and 
has nearly 100 researchers.

  [Text] Cheju, South Korea, Jan. 14 (YONHAP) -- The island 
province of Cheju will exchange a memorandum of understanding on 
a meeting to establish friendly relations with the Chinese 
province of Hainan, officials said Friday. 
  A delegation of nine officials and 13 businessmen from the 
Chinese province arrived in Cheju on Friday afternoon to discuss 
the establishment of sisterhood relations. 
  Governor Sin Ku-pum and Vice Governor Wang Sufeng, head of 
the delegation, discussed ways to form sisterhood relations 
between the provincial governments on Friday afternoon. 
  Wang plans to visit the provincial government office on 
Saturday to meet with Vice Governor Yi Man-ni to sign and 
exchange the memorandum. 
  The memorandum says that the two provincial governments 
agree 
that maintaining friendly and cooperative relations between the 
governments and populations and promoting mutual relations based 
on the principle of equality and reciprocity will be profitable 
for both governments. 
  The two sides decided to form sisterhood relations at an 
early date after recognizing the necessity of such relations.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 14 (YONHAP) -- Korea Telecom and Indosat 
Co., an Indonesian communications firm, have signed an agreement 
on joint projects, a company spokesman said Friday. 
  Telecom President Cho Paek-che and Indosat President 
Tjahjono 
Soerjodibroto signed the agreement at a Pacific partners' 
meeting in Hawaii. 
  They will form a consortium to participate in an 
international tender to be placed by the Indonesian Government 
for installing 2 million telephone lines on a build, operate and 
transfer (BOF) basis. 
  Under its sixth economic development plan, the Indonesian 
Government plans to install 5 million lines. 
  Developing countries prefer BOF, by which foreign firms 
operate invested facilities for a time and hand them over after 
gaining a preset profit. 
  If the consortium succeeds, it will help build Korea 
Telecom's reputation in the area, the spokesman said. 
  Telecom has consulted on two projects in Indonesia. One on 
communication technology at 3.9 million U.S. dollars and the 
other on building a communications network at 1.3 million 
dollars.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 13 (YONHAP) -- The half of major South 
Korean export companies fear they would suffer setbacks in 
exports to the United States due to the effectuation of the 
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). 
  The Korea Trade Promotion Corp. (KOTRA) reported on Thursday 
a survey it recently held of 150 leading export firms showed 
that 75 firms, just half of the companies surveyed, said they 
fear their exports would be adversely affected by the NAFTA. 
  Only 19 firms or 12.7 percent of the total said they expect 
no impact at all. On the other hand, 13 companies (8.7 percent) 
said they believe NAFTA would have a favorable effect on their 
exports. 
  As major factors behind negative effect, 69.6 percent of the 
firms questioned gave tariff removal among three NAFTA 
countries, 25.6 percent "country of origin" rules, and 4.8 
percent the opening of investment and service. 
  Of the firms surveyed, 30.1 percent replied they believe the 
country's exports would decline by 1-5 percent due to NAFTA, 
28.2 percent by 5-10 percent, and 19.4 percent by more than 10 
percent.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 13 (YONHAP) -- South Korea needs stable 
industrial relations if it is to become an advanced country, 
President Kim Yong-sam said Thursday after he received a report 
from the Labor Ministry at Chongwadae [presidential office]. 
  Kim told the Labor Ministry to do its best to make this year 
the first year of labor-management cooperation" and make efforts 
to keep the peace in industrial relations and encourage low wage 
demands. 
  "Pay raises reached 12 percent in stagnation last year. This 
pace of increase will weaken the competitiveness of industry," 
Kim said. 
  The ministry should see to it that unions obey the law when 
they exercise their rights and encourage district labor 
administration offices to do their best to prevent industrial 
disputes, Kim said. 
  It should also study the welfare of workers, including the 
expansion of stock-sharing for employees and of housing for 
workers, he said. 
  Preventing industrial accidents is important because of 
respect for human life and stabilization of occupation, he said. 
  "Enterprisers should have the mind that they are putting 
their own children to work," the president said. 
  In a separate briefing session later in the day, Kim 
instructed the Communications Ministry to make creation of a 
super high speed information network, the communications system 
of the future, its top priority project in 1994. 
  "Carry out the matters of primary concern, including selling 
stocks of communications businesses and selection of the 
business that will take the second cellular phone project justly 
and without any suspicion," he ordered. 
  He instructed the ministry to internationalize the 
communications industry and privatise communications companies 
to introduce competition in the field, most of which is 
currently state- controlled.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 13 (YONHAP) -- Five of the country's top 
10 business groups said Thursday they have decided on their 
three leading lines, but others still find the decision-making 
hard. 
  The Daewoo Group named automaking, heavy industries and 
service; Hanjin chose transportation, heavy industries and 
construction; Ssangyong picked automaking, non-metal mineral and 
energy; Kia opted for automaking, heavy industries and steel; 
and Hanhwa selected energy, chemical and service. 
  Among groups ranked from 20 to 30, Keumho, Daelim, Dongah, 
Hyonsung, Halla, Dongbu, Keukdong, Woosung, and Miwon have 
announced their two choices. 
  Other conglomerates, who face a Jan. 18 deadline to name 
their mainstay industrial fields, are said to be watching the 
moves of their rivals before making any decisions. 
  The Hyundai Group is reportedly set on automaking and 
electronics and is weighing chemical and heavy industries for 
its third choice. Samsung has picked electronics and heavy 
industries and is scrutinizing the chemical and service sectors. 
  Lucky-Goldstar is firm on electronics and chemicals, but is 
picky over energy and service, while it is easier for Daewoo as 
it became unnecessary to designate Daewoo electronics a mainstay 
firm since it was named a blue chip company for stock 
diversification. 
  Lotte is expected to choose construction over chemicals as 
it 
will be no match for Hyundai or Samsung if they name chemicals. 
  Sunkyong has decided on energy and chemicals and will choose 
another from electronics and service, but it is most likely to 
select the latter sector as its main subsidiary (SKC) can handle 
electronics and chemicals. 
  Haitai is set on beverages and food and will select the 
second field from electronics and service. The choice is said 
to be hard as it depends much on service, but must grow an 
electronics arm for the future.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 13 (YONHAP) -- Companies with a history 
of bad labor relations will be discriminated against in the 
doling out of state support as punishment for breaking 
industrial peace under a policy being drawn up by the Labor 
Ministry in consultation with other ministries, Labor Minister 
Nam Chae-hui told President Kim Yong-sam in a briefing on his 
Ministry's new year operating program Thursday. 
  Noting that labor relations at three strike-plagued Hyundai 
Group Companies -- Hyundai Motor, Hyundai Precision and 
Industries and Hyundai Heavy Industries -- in 1993 are being 
examined by the Korea Labor Research Institute, Nam said the 
government would see to it that they improved their labor 
relations on the basis of the recommendations to be made by the 
institute. 
  Companies in four booming sectors -- automobiles, 
shipbuilding, steel and electronics -- will be encouraged to pay 
special bonuses from their profits in shares, not in cash. 
  Easing of rules barring employees from selling shares 
obtained in employee stock ownership plans for five years is 
being discussed with the Finance Ministry, Nam said. 
  Under the proposed changes, the ban will be shortened so 
that 
employees in the four sectors may sell their shares after a year. 
  The four sectors will be induced to peg pay hikes at the 
level set by wage guidelines to be agreed on between the 
Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU) and the Korea 
Employers' Federation (KEF) and to invest their profits in 
research and development and expansion of welfare facilities for 
employees. 
  The government will ensure that collective pay bargaining is 
finished according to the FKTU-KEF guidelines by April or May in 
all industrial sectors. 
  Nam recommended that Kim call a government-labor-management 
meeting to celebrate and promote industrial peace after 
collective bargaining is completed. 
  He said his Ministry would study when and how labor-related 
laws should be amended after pay negotiations are settled in all 
areas. 
  Illegal labor disputes, especially involvement of a third 
party in a labor dispute, will be dealt with strictly by law, 
Nam said.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 13 (YONHAP) -- Nearly 9 billion U.S. 
dollars flowed into South Korea last year, making it hard to 
control the money supply or stabilize exchange rates, the Bank 
of Korea said Thursday. 
  Net inflow last year was 8.91 billion dollars, up 28.6 
percent from 6.92 billion dollars in 1992 and the highest figure 
so far, the central bank said. 
  The financial sector drew 1.07 billion dollars, down from 
2.65 billion dollars in 1992 because of a decline in bank loans, 
the private sector attracted 9.88 billion dollars, up from 5.22 
billion dollars, and the public sector got 2.04 billion dollars, 
up from 950 million dollars, by paying loans in advance. 
  The sharp rise in the private sector was caused by three 
factors: One: Foreign funds to invest in the stock market rose 
from 2.06 billion dollars to 5.75 billion dollars, two: Euro 
bonds floated by Korean companies soared from 1.8 billion 
dollars to 2.93 billion dollars, three: Deposits for export on 
deferred payment term jumped from 1.75 billion dollars to 1.81 
billion dollars because of a drop in global interest rates and a 
rush of shipbuilding orders. 
  The Korea Development Institute has predicted this year's 
inflow at 18 billion dollars and advised the government to take 
measures to curb the side-effects.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 14 (YONHAP) -- Little money has flowed 
out of the stock market since introduction of the real-name 
financial system in August last year, while large deposits have 
increased, Daewoo Securities Co. said Friday. 
  In a comparative survey in April, June, September and 
November last year, Daewoo found a drop in the total number of 
accounts at its branches after it became mandatory to use real 
names, but a fast rise in large deposits. 
  Accounts totaled 605,717 in April, rose 3.91 percent to 
629,422 in June, fell 13.66 percent to 543,470 in September and 
sank 6.29 percent to 509,289 in November. 
  Large deposits, above 100 million won (123,304 U.S. 
dollars), 
totaled 4,207 in April, rose 6.99 percent to 4,501 in June, 
dropped 6.51 percent to 4,208 in September and, immediately 
after introduction of the real-name system, recovered 9.13 
percent to 4,592 in November. 
  Large deposits accounted for 0.69 percent of the total 
accounts in April, 0.72 percent in June, 0.77 percent in 
September, and 0.9 percent in November. 
  They made their way to the stock market because they had 
little choice of places to go after the real-name system took 
effect, a Daewoo official said. 
  Large deposits grew 59 each in Kangnam and Kangpuk, both in 
Seoul, 47 in Pusan, and 44 in South Kyongsang Province during 
September-November.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 14 (YONHAP) -- Prices crashed on the 
Korea stock exchange on Friday after the government announced 
that it was preparing measures to take some of the heat out of 
the market. 
  The all-share composite stock price index was nearing 900 
points on a three-day rebound when the announcement that the 
government wanted prices to drop sent it nosediving 15.85 points 
to 882.81 as of 2:15 p.m. 
  It had diagnosed signs of overheating in the market, the 
government said, and so decided to cool things off by letting 
securities companies lend shares, making institutional investors 
put down deposits on stock like small investors, and encouraging 
banks and other financial institutions not to buy shares. This 
is to take effect on Monday. 
  There was little change on the surface at first as the flood 
of sell offers generated by the rebirth of share loans and 
selling by the stock stabilization fund was absorbed, but the 
selling got the upper hand toward the end of the morning session. 
  Just a few high PER (price/earnings ratio) shares such as 
Taekwang Industrial Co. and large manufacturing issues such as 
Pohang Iron and Steel Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. rose by 
the daily ceiling.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 13 (YONHAP) -- South Korea exported 280 
strategic commodities for 102,285,000 U.S. dollars in the final 
quarter of 1993, the Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry said 
Thursday. 
  Korea joined the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral 
Export Controls (COCOM) in October after establishing a system 
according to a memorandum of understanding on exports of 
strategic commodities and technical data signed in September 
1987. 
  The exports comprised 100,912,000 dollars of 
telecommunications equipment, including computers, 963,000 
dollars of machinery, including navigation systems, and 410,000 
dollars of materials, including carbon fiber. 
  Exports to former or current communist countries, including 
China, Poland, Russia, Vietnam and Hungary, were less than 19.8 
million dollars, or 19.4 percent of the total. The remaining 
exports of strategic goods were to Singapore, Germany, Malaysia, 
Hong Kong, the United States and Taiwan. 
  Import certificates issued by the government reached 1,962 
million dollars. 
  The certificates are promises by a company not to export 
strategic items that it has purchased, and must be sent to the 
seller before he can ship the goods.

they are unified, Communications Minister Yun Tong-yun said 
Thursday. 
  Companies with their own communications networks, like Korea 
Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO) and Korea Highway Corp., will be 
able to take part in exclusive circuit projects such as cable 
television from next January, Yun told reporters after reporting 
his communications agenda to the president earlier in the day. 
  The fences between general and specific communications 
sectors will be torn down, paving the way for all the 
telecommunications companies to jump into other communications 
businesses, Yu said.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 14 (YONHAP) -- The Defense Security 
Command Friday questioned two former aides of Rep. Cho Sun-hwan 
of the United People's Party about a missing classified 
document, grilling them about how they had handled the material. 
  The two are former assistant Yi Un-chae, 38, and former 
secretary Chong Chu-hun, 31. 
  Noting that Chong made three visits to Japan between 1987 
and 
1993, the interrogation focused on whether he had any connection 
with Chochongnyon, the pro-Pyongyang Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan, a spokesman said. 
  Chong lived in Japan between July 18, 1987, and Nov. 17, 
1990, for study; and between Nov. 21, 1990, and April 13, 1993, 
for further study. He visited Japan from Sept. 30 to Oct. 3, 
1993, on business. 
  Chong and Yi were summoned for interrogation on Thursday 
afternoon after a tip that he planned to visit Japan again.

  [Text] North Korea is likely to respond on 14 January to 
the IAEA checklist that was delivered to the North on 10 January 
for inspection of the seven nuclear facilities [haek sisol]. 
  On 13 January, Yun Ho-chin, counselor of the North Korean 
Embassy in Vienna, who is the chief North Korean delegate to 
working-level contacts with the IAEA, said that North Korea 
would respond to the IAEA demand soon and that its response was 
delayed because there were many things to review carefully due 
to differences in basic positions [kibonjogin ipchang chairo] 
between North Korea and the IAEA. 
  He also hinted that North Korea will not completely meet the 
IAEA demand despite an agreement with the United States, 
stressing that there is no change in their position that the 
nuclear issue should be resolved through negotiations between 
North Korea and the United States.

  [Text] At quadrilateral trade talks among the United 
States, Japan, Canada, and European nations, the United States 
and European nations have called for starting renegotiations on 
some portions of agreements reached under the (Uruguay Round of 
GATT's) multilateral trade talks. In this connection, speaking 
at a news conference on 13 January, Vice Minister Kyogoku of the 
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries [MAFF] 
criticized the moves of the United States and European nations, 
saying: "This is outrageous, and we cannot accept their 
requests." 
  Regarding trade issues involving the ministry, the United 
States is calling on Japan to make further concessions to lower 
a tariff rate for wood products. Vice Minister Kyogoku said "we 
have already confirmed with the United States that negotiations 
were concluded," thus reiterating that Japan has no intention of 
renegotiating the trade issues.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 14 KYODO -- Japanese Trade Minister 
Hiroshi Kumagai ruled out Friday [14 January] a new round of 
quadrilateral ministerial trade talks on market access under the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  Kumagai, minister of international trade and industry, made 
the remark in response to recent news reports that the United 
States and the European Union (EU) have agreed to call for 
ministerial talks among the four trading partners of Canada, the 
EU, Japan and the U.S. next month. 
  "There is no possibility of a new round of talks since 
negotiations have already been concluded," he said. 
  Working-level talks will be enough if they want to confirm 
agreements reached under the GATT negotiations, he added. 
  Kumagai also said no ministerial talks are required for 
Japan 
and the U.S. at this stage to break an impasse in their talks on 
a "framework" for bilateral trade. 
  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor suggested both sides 
hold high-level talks to straighten out differences. 
  The two parties should continue negotiations strenuously, 
rather than setting the stage for higher-level talks, he said.

  [Text] Wakayama, Jan. 13 KYODO -- The Wakayama District 
Court on Thursday [13 January] sentenced 26 Chinese accused of 
illegally entering Japan to eight months in prison with the 
sentences suspended for three years. 
  The 26 Chinese were the first group to be sentenced among 78 
people from China's coastal province of Fujian who were charged 
with illegally entering Japan. 
  Presiding Judge Yoshimichi Takigawa handed down suspended 
sentences, saying there was room for sympathy although they 
entered Japan for the purpose of working illegally in the 
country. Prosecutors had demanded prison terms of eight months. 
  The 78 Chinese were among a group of 104 who arrived in 
Shirahama, Wakayama Prefecture, on November 22 aboard a 
Taiwanese-registered fishing vessel. 
  Prosecutors did not charge the seven crew members and 19 
other Chinese were not indicted because they are minors. 
  The group left China on November 8 after paying about 30,000 
renminbi (about 400,000 yen) to Chinese brokers.

this morning that Japanese-made frequency analysis devices 
[chupasu punsoggi], which have been strictly controlled by the 
Coordinating Committee for Exports to Communist Areas as 
strategic materials, have been illegally flown into North Korea, 
and that it is possible that North Korea has used them as spare 
parts for missiles. 
  The paper reported that the devices, which have been 
illegally flown into North Korea, are being mainly used for 
military purposes to increase the accuracy of ballistic 
missiles, and that it is more possible that North Korea has used 
them as spare parts for the Nodong No. 1 missile. 
  The security department of the Japanese Police Office has 
obtained such information and is secretly investigating the 
route of the illegal flow into North Korea, the corporations 
that illegally transported them, and the enterprises which 
exported them to North Korea.

  [Text] Australia has announced a new aid package to 
Ethiopia, coinciding with the visit to the African country by 
Foreign Minister Gareth Evans. The package totals Australian $6 
million and will go toward refugee and relief activities to help 
rebuilding the country after three decades of civil war and 
drought. 
  Announcing the package in Australia, development assistance 
minister, Gordon Bilney, described Ethiopia as one of the 
world's poorest countries. In a statement, Mr. Bilney said that 
while the Ethiopian Government had set medium-term goals of 
rehabilitation and development, there were immediate needs for 
food and health and farm assistance. 
  Australia's overseas aid agency, AIDAB [Australian 
International Development Assistance Bureau] will spend most of 
the new aid on buying and distributing Australian wheat through 
the world food program. The remainder of the money will be 
spent on an immunization program and construction of sustainable 
rural water supply systems in the Tigre region to help prevent 
health problems associated with poor water supplies. 
  Foreign Minister Evans is set to hold talks in Ethiopia with 
goverment ministers and senior officials.

31,000. That means around 937,500 Australians were officially 
out of work in the month. 
  Most Australian states mirrored the downward trend in 
unemployment. The figures show 22,000 people nationally found 
jobs during the month, partly attributable to the usual 
pre-Christmas increase in available work. But the number of 
people officially looking for work appears to have dropped -- 
typically a sign of disillusionment with the continuing poor job 
outlook. The better overall outlook though continues a steady, 
if slow, trend of serveral months. 
  Unemployment will be a major policy focus this year with the 
Keating government preparing a final paper on addressing 
long-term unemployment. [end recording]

  [Text] A former leadership rival to Fiji's Prime Minister 
Sitiveni Rabuka has begun his rebel party election campaign with 
a bitter attack on the government's record. Former Deputy Prime 
Minister Josefata Kamikamica, expelled from the Fijian Political 
Party last month, said the rebirth of the Fiji Association was a 
political necessity. Mr. Kamikamica accused Mr. Rabuka's 
coalition government of ineptitude, deception, and dishonorable 
behavior. Mr. Kamikamica was one of seven government dissidents 
expelled from the governing Fijian Political Party after helping 
to defeat the 1994 budget in parliament last November. Mr. 
Rabuka called a snap election for February. 
  The Fiji Association plans to contest 27 of the 37 seats set 
aside for Fijians under the racially-biased 1990 constitution. 
If it gained enough support in those seats in the 33 seats open 
to Fiji Indians and other racial minorities, it could threaten 
Mr. Rabuka's hold on power.

  [Text] Papua New Guinea [PNG] Government officials have 
arrived in the nation's Western Province to investigate report 
that Indonesian troops crossed into PNG recently and burned down 
the village of (Kwa). The party of officials is expected to 
return to Port Moresby next week with the report on the incident 
for the provincial affairs and village services minister, John 
Nikare. 
  The environment minister and member of Parliament for (South 
Fly), Perry Zeipi, claims that Indonesian troops torched (Kwa), 
but the allegation was being dismissed by Jakarta. 
  Other reports at present being examined by Mr. Nikare 
suggest 
that guerrillas associated with the Free Papua Movement, OPM 
[Papua Freedom Operation], may have been responsible for the 
destruction of the village. 
  The investigating team now in the Western Province is 
scheduled to have talks with (Kwa) villagers before returning to 
the capital.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 18 KYODO -- Japan cannot accept a U.S. 
proposal to introduce a multiple set of yardsticks to measure 
import penetration of Japanese markets, a government source said 
Tuesday [18 January]. 
  The United States made the proposal in bilateral "framework" 
trade talks held earlier this month in Washington, but Japan 
rejected it. 
  The source said the proposed targets would lead to managed 
trade, at a time when the world is moving toward free trade. 
  It is "now up to the U.S. to make concessions" in the 
stalled 
talks, the source said. 
  The source also said Japan cannot accept a U.S. proposal to 
hold a quadrilateral ministerial meeting on market ccess in 
advance of the Japan-U.S. summit in Washington between Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton on 
February 11. 
  The proposal "is out of the question," the source said. 
  Washington had proposed the talks among the United States, 
the European Union, Canada and Japan under the auspices of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 18 KYODO -- Japan's trade minister on 
Tuesday rejected U.S. criticism that Japanese bureaucracy has 
blocked the bilateral trade framework negotiations. 
  International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai 
said at a press conference that his ministry's role is to 
prepare the environment for the private auto industry to 
cooperate with their U.S. counterparts in expanding exports to 
Japan. 
  "It is not bureaucrats that are impeding the negotiations," 
Kumagai said. 
  "The government of (Prime Minister Morihiro) Hosokawa 
intends 
to enhance transparency of Japanese markets, while the private 
sector is hoping for a balanced expansion," of the auto trade, 
he said. 
  "Understanding on these points has deepened," the minister 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 17 KYODO -- Japan has no knowledge of 
a meeting reportedly slated for February of finance ministers 
and central bankers of the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized 
nations, a senior Finance Ministry [MOF] official said Monday 
[17 January]. 
  "I haven't heard of that," Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito 
told a regular press conference. 
  He was referring to newspaper reports that Germany has 
proposed holding such a G-7 meeting in late February. 
  Saito, however, confirmed that a meeting of finance 
ministers 
from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum on March 
18 and 19 in Hawaii will take place as disclosed earlier Monday 
by U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. 
  The meeting will be for "exchanging views informally" on 
cooperation in the region and "not for negotiations," Saito said. 
  Turning to domestic issues, he denied reports of an 
agreement 
among the coalition parties for the government to compile the 
fiscal 1994 budget around February 10, with the Finance Ministry 
to announce its budget plan on February 5. 
  The ministry has not received any instructions on the 
timetable, Saito said. 
  But the ruling parties are to hold a meeting of their 
policy-making forum, he said. 
  Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic 
Party 
[of Japan], the largest of the coalition parties, said Saturday 
that the parties have agreed on the budget schedule.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 18 KYODO -- Japan has not received any 
notice of a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers of 
the Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations in February, Finance 
Minister Hirohisa Fujii said Tuesday [18 January]. 
  "I haven't heard...and don't know," about such a meeting, 
Fujii told reporters after a regular cabinet meeting. He was 
referring to reports of a German proposal to hold a G-7 meeting 
in late February. 
  Fujii also denied reports that he would be talking with U.S. 
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen on Sunday in Tokyo, saying, "I 
have absolutely not heard of it...I learned of his (Bentsen's) 
schedule for the first time through newspapers." 
  Concerning a meeting of finance ministers of the 
Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, Fujii said it will be held in 
Hawaii on March 18 and 19 as disclosed by Bentsen on Monday. 
  The APEC meeting will be for "exchanging wide-ranging 
views...and not for negotating policies," he said. 
  Turning to domestic issues, Fujii repeated that the timing 
and size of an increase in the consumption tax must be included 
in a package of tax reform bills for cutting income tax. 
  That is the "collateral" for issuing "bridge bonds" to 
finance the tax cut, Fujii said, reiterating his strong 
opposition to an issuance of "untreated" deficit-financing bonds. 
  The finance minister has retracted his objection to cutting 
income tax before raising the consumption tax as a stimulus 
measure on condition that repayment of bonds is guaranteed. 
  On Friday, disputes surfaced between the Finance Ministry 
and 
the Tax Commission over the sensitive issue of tax reform. 
  Kan Kato, head of an advisory panel to the prime minister, 
told reporters that a simultaneous cut in income tax and 
increase in the consumption tax rate is "not necessary," 
apparently opening the way for further objections to such a move 
by the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] and some other parties 
in the ruling coalition which oppose a tax increase. 
  But later Friday, Kato called a press meeting to retract his 
comments after they drew strong objections from the ministry. 
  Meanwhile, Fujii welcomed decisions by the coalition parties 
to drop a proposal to use public funds to purchase land as a way 
to stimulate the real estate market. 
  "I believe the decisions are correct...because the 
government 
can't win public support," he said, pointing to the easing of 
regulations as one of a number of measures and saying his 
ministry is still studying what actions can be taken. 
  He also rejected any changes in the land tax.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 17 KYODO -- The resignation of Russian 
First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar, who spearheaded 
Russia's market reforms, will not affect relations between Japan 
and Russia, Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito said Monday [17 
January]. 
  "If Gaydar's resignation weakens Russia's reform efforts, it 
would be very regrettable," Saito told a press conference. 
  But Japan-Russia relations, and Japan's policy toward Russia 
will not change because of the resignation of the reformist, 
Saito said. 
  Japan has a policy of "adequately" supporting Russia's 
efforts for democratization and its shift toward a 
market-oriented economy and that policy will remain unchanged, 
he said. 
  The Japanese Government hopes the Russian Government will 
continue doing its utmost to achieve reforms, he said. 
  Gaydar, 37, announced Sunday he was leaving the government 
over disagreements with its recent decisions.

supported the Mideast talks on a multilateral arena and has

will continue such support.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 14 KYODO -- Japan will contribute 3.6 
million dollars to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) to help repatriate Myanmar [Burma] refugees from 
Bangladesh, Foreign Ministry officials said Friday [14 January]. 
  The contribution is in response to a UNHCR appeal in 
December 
for a donation of about 34 million dollars in total for the 
repatriation program, the officials said. 
  The fund will be used to transport some 200,000 Myanmar 
refugees, provide goods for daily use and implement small-scale 
projects on agriculture, health, water and sanitation in support 
of resettlement of the repatriated people, they said. 
  Islamic residents account for about 3.8 percent of Myanmar's 
population of 42 million people, according to Foreign Ministry 
statistics. 
  Since 1991, Islamic Myanmar residents began moving to 
Bangladesh citing oppression, with the number of Myanmar 
refugees in Bangladesh reaching 250,000 by March 1992, they said. 
  But based on an agreement between foreign ministers of both 
countries, the refugees began returning to Myanmar and more than 
52,000 people have returned to date, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 14 KYODO -- The government on Friday 
[14 January] formulated a final draft for the planned action 
program aimed at boosting foreign access to Japan's construction 
market, government sources said. 
  The action plan, worked out at a meeting of senior officials 
of concerned ministries, calls for introducing an open bidding 
system on public works projects ordered by both the central and 
local governments. 
  Currently, only designated contractors are allowed to 
participate in bidding for most public works projects. 
  According to the final draft, the open bidding system will 
be 
introduced for state-sponsored works projects worth 4.5 million 
special drawing rights [SDR's], or 700 million yen, or more. 
  One SDR is currently valued at 190 yen, but the Finance 
Ministry plans to change the rate to 160 yen from April. The 
plan is based on the new exchange rate. 
  If the works are ordered by the country's 47 prefectures, or 
12 designated cities, and 85 public corporations like the Japan 
Highway Public Corp., the threshold is 15 million SDRs, or 2.4 
billion yen. 
  The plan will come into force in April. 
  The action plan will be approved at a cabinet meeting 
scheduled for next Tuesday, in time for the January 20 deadline 
for threatened U.S. sanctions. 
  The United States originally threatened to retaliate if 
Japan 
failed to come up with effective measures for opening the 
construction market by October 31. 
  It extended the deadline to January 20 in October, 
responding 
to a Japanese pledge to draft an action program on the matter 
early this year. 
  The sources said the draft plan has already received basic 
approval from U.S. negotiators in bilateral construction-market 
talks. 
  Open bidding will also start for design consulting services 
for public works projects. Such services for state projects are 
put to open bidding if they are worth 450,000 SDRs or more and 
those for local governments 1.5 million SDRs. 
  As for a 1988 Japan-U.S. pact on preferential treatment for 
foreign contractors in 40 major projects, the government has 
decided not to immediately abolish it and agreed rather to phase 
it out by applying open bidding on those projects.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 18 KYODO -- The government decided 
Tuesday [18 January] on an action program aimed at boosting 
foreign access to Japan's construction market. 
  The program calls for introducing an open bidding system on 
public works projects ordered by central and local governments 
and 84 public corporations. At present, only designated 
contractors are allowed to participate in bidding for most 
public works projects. 
  Under the new program, the open bidding system will be 
introduced for central government-sponsored public works 
projects worth 4.5 million special drawing rights (SDR), or 
about 720 million yen, or above. One SDR is presently valued at 
160 yen. 
  On eligibility to take part in open tenders, the program 
makes it clear that construction firms, whether Japanese or 
foreign, will be treated in a nondiscriminatory manner. 
  Projects, valued at 4.5 million SDRs or above, will be 
opened 
for bidding to foreign enterprises. 
  If public works are ordered by the country's 47 prefectures, 
12 designated major cities and 84 public corporations like the 
Japan Highway Public Corp., the threshold will be 15 million 
SDRs. 
  For public works worth less, the existing designated 
competitive bidding system will be applied, on condition that 
the ordering body ensures greater transparency and objectivity 
in designation and other related formalities. 
  The government drew up the action program to be in time for 
the January 20 deadline for threatened U.S. sanctions. 
  The United States initially threatened to retaliate if Japan 
failed to come up with effective measures to open the 
construction market by October 31, 1993, but in October extended 
the deadline to January 20. 
  On design and consulting services concerned with public 
works 
projects, too, the designated bidding system has so far been 
applied. 
  But the new program introduces a system for choosing 
participants from among those wishing to get orders which will 
apply to such services worth 450,000 SDRs or above to be ordered 
by the central government and public corporations, and services 
valued at 1.5 million SDRs or above ordered by prefectures and 
designated major cities. 
  The existing construction procurement checking committee 
will 
act as an agency for disinterested parties in taking up 
complaints relating to open bidding. 
  To prevent bid-rigging practices and bribery, a plan to make 
the guidelines for supervising and dealing with those found to 
have engaged in such acts much more severe than at present will 
be drawn up by the end of March. 
  The Fair Trade Commission will also lay down guidelines by 
this summer to prevent bid-rigging in public works projects. 
  The existing "construction guidelines" which are notorious 
for their numerous loopholes will be abolished.

  -- For projects undertaken by any of the nation's 47 
prefectures or 12 designated major cities, these measures will 
apply to construction works worth 15 million SDRs (2.4 billion 
yen) or more and design and consulting works valued at 1.5 
million SDRs (240 million yen) or more.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 18 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Tuesday [18 January] a fresh action program to 
open large-scale public works projects to foreign bidders will 
have a "historic" impact on Japan's social and economic 
structures. 
  "The just-formulated measures are intended for a sweeping 
change of our public works bidding system and are historic in 
light of their effect on our social and economic structures," 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura quoted the premier as 
telling a cabinet meeting. 
  Hosokawa also sought further cooperation of cabinet 
ministers 
in smoothly implementing the action program to open Japan's 
large-scale public works projects to foreign bidders, the top 
government spokesman told a news conference. 
  Takemura said he believes the scheme marks a major shift in 
the collusive nature of some practices in Japan, such as illegal 
prearranged bidding for public works projects.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 18 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata called at a regular cabinet meeting Tuesday [18 January] 
for "sincere" enforcement of the just-approved action program 
for improving Japan's public works bidding system. 
  "The new bidding systems and contract procedures laid out in 
the action program are internationally appropriate," in line 
with the agreement reached at the Uruguay Round of world trade 
talks, Hata said. 
  He then asked for support from all the government ministers 
for "sincere" implementation of the program. 
  The program calling for introducing an open bidding system 
on 
public works projects to boost foreign access to Japan's 
construction market, was approved at the morning cabinet meeting.

  [Excerpts] As the U.S. imposed deadline for taking action 
to open the Japanese construction market neared, and the threat 
of sanctions loomed larger, the cabinet held a meeting today to 
approve a construction industry action program. The program is 
Tokyo's final proposal for concluding Japan-U.S. construction 
talks. 
  The United States has made strong demands that Japan open 
its 
construction market, saying it would impose sanctions against 
Japan unless it presented satisfactory measures for the opening 
of its construction market by 20 January. 
  In response the government has mapped out the action 
program. 
[passage omitted on Hosokawa's comment on action program]. 
  Commenting on the action program this morning at a news 
conference after the cabinet meeting, Construction Minister Kozo 
Igarashi said: The action program will further promote the 
opening of Japan's construction market, which is what the United 
States and other countries have asked. I am convinced that they 
will rate the action program highly. I hope the program will 
lead to a smooth settlement of Japan-U.S. construction talks.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 18 KYODO -- The Japanese construction 
industry will make all efforts to head off unfair practices and 
recover trust by acting in line with a new action program for 
improvement of bidding and contract procedures, an industry 
federation said Tuesday [18 January]. 
  The Japan Federation of Construction Contractors Inc. issued 
the comments in a written form after the cabinet Tuesday morning 
approved the action program to make bidding for public works 
more open. 
  In the statement, the federation said, "It is necessary for 
the Japanese industry as a whole to tackle seriously the problem 
of averting unfair practices." It noted that the program 
includes stronger penalties for those involved in illicit deals. 
  Japan's construction industry has been shaken by a series of 
major bribery and bid-rigging scandals in the past year.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 17 KYODO -- Prosecutors are 
investigating major contractor Obayashi Corp. on suspicion that 
it gave 10 million yen to former Sendai Mayor Toru Ishii to 
secure favorable treatment in a bid for a public works contract, 
sources close to prosecutors said Monday [17 January]. 
  The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office has questioned 
Obayashi Corp. officials, including a 66-year-old vice 
president, and Sendai City officials on a voluntary basis, the 
sources said. 
  Investigators believe the Osaka-based company gave 10 
million 
yen to Ishii, then Sendai mayor, in October 1992 after asking 
him for favorable consideration in its bid for a 8.2 billion yen 
project to construct a waste incineration plant, they said. 
  Ishii allegedly proposed to city officials that they 
separate 
the bids for the building and other parts of the plant in 
response to the firm's request. 
  Obayashi Corp., Japan's fourth-largest construction firm, 
wanted to contract only the building, but the bid was held in 
June last year as one lump package in spite of Ishii's efforts, 
they said. 
  The concern subcontracted part of the project from 
Osaka-based plant maker Hitachi Zosen Corp., which won the 
contract for the whole project to build the Kuzuoka Waste 
Incineration Plant, scheduled to be completed by September 1995. 
  No official of Obayashi Corp. has been arrested or charged 
in 
the current wave of bribery scandals involving mayors and 
governors, in which officials of seven major construction firms 
and a paper manufacturer have been indicted since last summer. 
  Ishii, 68, is on trial for allegedly taking a total of 130 
million yen in bribes from six general contractors including 
Hazama Corp., Shimizu Corp., Taisei Co., and Nishimatsu 
Construction Co.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 18 KYODO -- Prosecutors arrested a vice 
president and a director of major contractor Obayashi Corp. on 
Tuesday [18 January] on suspicion of giving a 10 million yen 
bribe in 1992 to then Sendai Mayor Toru Ishii. 
  Vice President Koreaki Hagihara, 66, and Director Juichi 
Konishi, 59, allegedly conspired to give the money to Ishii, 69, 
as a reward for favorable treatment in the awarding of public 
works projects, informed sources said. 
  Investigators from the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors 
Office also raided the Osaka and Tokyo headquarters of Obayashi 
and other related sites in a search for evidence of suspected 
illicit payments. 
  Obayashi President Takao Tsumuro apologized for the 
controversy but denied the company's involvement in the scandal. 
  Obayashi is Japan's fourth largest construction firm in 
terms 
of sales, following Shimizu Corp., Kajima Corp. and Taisei Corp. 
  The sources said the Osaka-based company is suspected of 
giving Ishii 10 million yen in October 1992 after asking him for 
favorable consideration in its bid for an 8.2 billion yen 
project to construct a waste incineration plant in Sendai, the 
capital of Miyagi Prefecture. 
  The alleged bribe was also intended as a reward for his 
efforts in awarding such projects as building a subway station, 
the sources said. 
  The money is believed to have been received on Ishii's 
behalf 
by his aide Mitsuo Moriya, deputy secretary general of the 
Miyagi Prefectural chapter of the Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP), who is under indictment in a separate bribery case 
involving former Miyagi Gov. Shuntaro Honma. 
  Investigators suspect that Ishii, as mayor of Sendai, may 
have received a total of 140 million yen in payments from eight 
construction companies, including Obayashi, for alleged 
favorable consideration on project bids, the sources said. 
Ishii resigned as mayor soon after he was arrested last June. 
  In a related development, informed sources said Obayashi's 
wholly owned subsidiary allegedly paid some 30 million yen in 
rental payments for a Tokyo office of senior LDP politician 
Hiroshi Mitsuzuka. 
  The subsidiary shouldered about 500,000 yen a month for five 
years starting from December 1983, the sources said. 
  Mitsuzuka, former chairman of the LDP's Policy Affairs 
Research Council, has been elected as a House of Representatives 
member from a constituency in Miyagi Prefecture. 
  Commenting on the arrest of Obayashi's executives, 
Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi said he thinks the series of 
arrests of top executives of general contractors represents "a 
structural problem" in the country's construction industry. 
  Igarashi stressed the need for fundamental reform of the 
industry. 
  After the arrests of the senior Obayashi officials, several 
municipal and prefectural governments announced they will 
suspend nominating the company as a bidder in public works 
projects. 
  Kanagawa Prefecture and the city of Yokohama, south of 
Tokyo, 
decided to suspend nomination of Obayashi as a bidder for three 
months until April 17. 
  Okayama Prefecture and Kitakyushu City, western Japan, 
imposed a four months' ban on the company's participation in 
public works bids.

  [Text] Kagoshima, Jan. 15 KYODO -- The coalition government 
of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will compile the fiscal 1994 
state budget around February 10, a senior ruling party official 
said Saturday. 
  Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] Secretary 
General Wataru Kubo told reporters the Finance Ministry will 
reveal its budget plan on February 5. 
  Parties in the ruling coalition have already agreed on the 
budget schedule, said Kubo, the No. 2 man in the SDP, the 
largest among the seven ruling parties. 
  Kubo also said the government needs to prepare a third 
supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 in parallel with the 
compilation of the fiscal 1994 budget. 
  Japan's fiscal year starts April 1 and lasts through March 
31 
the following year. 
  In Japan, the government makes it a rule to compile budgets 
in late December. But this time, Hosokawa's cabinet put 
priority on the passage of political reform bills and postponed 
compilation of the fiscal 1994 budget to February. 
  Kubo reiterated the SDP's argument to implement an income 
tax 
cut as part of efforts to shore up the long sluggish Japanese 
economy. He called for issuing short-term, deficit-covering 
bonds to finance the tax reduction. 
  Kubo said the Hosokawa cabinet may resign en masse if it 
fails to gain Diet approval of the political reform bills during 
the current extraordinary Diet session ending January 29. 
  "On my forecast, the possibility of (the cabinet's) 
resigning 
en masse is strong," Kubo said. 
  The package of bills, designed to introduce single-seat 
electoral districts and impose antigraft measures, have been 
pending in the House of Councillors since November. 
  Hosokawa has staked his premiership on enacting the bills 
before the end of the current extended session of the Diet.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 17 KYODO -- The coalition government 
of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa plans to formulate an 
austere state budget for fiscal 1994 to cope with straitened 
finances resulting from the recession, government sources said 
Monday [17 January]. 
  The sources said the general account budget for the year 
beginning April 1 will be about 74 trillion yen, up about 3.0 
percent in nominal terms over the original program for the 
current fiscal year. 
  The actual scale of the budget after complicated accounting 
adjustments, will fall substantially short of the original 
fiscal 1993 budget totaling 72.35 trillion yen, they said. 
  The government will be forced to issue deficit-covering 
national bonds for the first time in five years if proposed 
income tax cuts are implemented, they said. 
  The Finance Ministry plans to finalize its draft budget for 
fiscal 1994 by around February 5, with the government adopting 
its budget plan around February 10, the sources said. 
  The ministry at the same time is working out another 
pump-priming supplementary budget for fiscal 1993, the third in 
a series, they said. 
  The ministry estimates tax revenues in the coming fiscal 
year 
at around 58 trillion yen, compared with 55.68 trillion yen 
estimated for the current year. 
  It plans to issue 8 trillion to 9 trillion yen worth of 
construction bonds to make up for the revenue shortfall, the 
sources said. 
  The Finance Ministry plans to slash budgetary requests by 
government ministries and agencies by more than 700 billion yen 
to keep total expenditures to just under 50 trillion yen. 
  It will approve budgetary requests of some 8.9 trillion yen 
for public works projects in the new fiscal year, the sources 
said. 
  The budget for servicing outstanding national bonds will be 
held to around 15 trillion yen, down from 15.44 trillion yen for 
fiscal 1993, because of lower interest rates, they said. 
  Local governments will be requested to repay interest-free 
loans from the central government worth about 2.2 trillion yen 
ahead of schedule in fiscal 1994. 
  To ease the impact on finances of local entities, the 
central 
government will offer an equivalent amount of loans with funds 
raised through construction bond issues, the sources said. 
  Construction bonds worth a total 11 trillion yen will be 
issued during the new fiscal year, they said. 
  The total amount of national bonds to be issued will hit a 
record 15 trillion yen if bonds to cover income tax cuts are 
floated.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 14 KYODO -- An income tax cut will 
stimulate the economy even if a consumption tax hike is included 
in the same tax reform law for later implementation, a 
government advisory tax panel said Friday [14 January]. 
  "A tax cut might have been ineffective last year, but would 
be effective this year" with the economy "starting to show signs 
of hitting bottom," Kan Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission 
told reporters. 
  Against this backdrop, he reiterated that a tax hike would 
not undermine consumption, and the government and politicians 
should clearly state "a consumption tax hike and its timing" in 
the same law to guarantee repayment of "bridge" bonds to fund 
the tax cut. 
  But the rate of the new consumption tax, currently at 3 
percent, does not necessarily have to be mentioned because the 
situation changes, said the head of the advisory panel to the 
prime minister. 
  Referring to opinions that an economic recovery with the tax 
cut will lead to increased tax revenues, Kato said such a 
scenario has already proved wrong in the United States under the 
administration of President Ronald Reagan. 
  "Bridge bonds are for repayment in the short term, and it's 
irresponsible... to borrow without any scheme for paying back," 
Kato said. 
  "Politicians may not win votes with a consumption tax 
hike... 
but those who correct public views instead of just following 
them are the true politicians," he said. 
  Kato stressed that "last-minute" spending can be expected 
before a sales tax hike as in the case of China. The panel is to 
study the Chinese case, he added. 
  The argument that a tax hike would dampen consumption is 
"absolutely a fiction" especially in Japan where savings are 
still high compared with other countries, Kato said. 
  As for signs of the economy hitting bottom, he cited 
recovering spending mainly on housing resulting from lower land 
prices, the impact of the yen's appreciation changing favorably 
for Japanese companies, and an expected increase in automobile 
purchases from the tax cut. 
  He also said the bribery scandals involving general 
contractors that have stymied progress in public works are near 
settlement, and the agreement on multilateral trade talks may 
lead to lower prices. 
  Meanwhile, a senior tax panel member told reporters the 
panel 
cannot support any issuance of deficit-covering bonds and wants 
the government to carry out the tax cut and hike in a single 
package. 
  But the panel, which resumed to discuss fiscal 1994 tax 
reform on Friday after suspension since mid-December, confirmed 
its stance of "leaving the decision to the government and the 
coalition parties," he told reporters after the meeting. 
  The member said the panel decided to discuss such reforms as 
methods to increase liquidity in the land market and corrections 
of unfair levy systems on nonprofit institutions, he said. 
  As for a new timetable, he said members will meet on Tuesday 
and Friday next week, and hold meetings almost every day from 
the following week.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 14 KYODO -- The government should 
include the rate to which the consumption tax will be hiked in a 
measure to cut income and other taxes, the head of a government 
tax panel said late Friday [14 January], correcting remarks he 
made earlier in the day. 
  "Future consumption tax must be indicated... and should be 
stated in a package of tax reform bills" on cuts in income tax 
and taxes levied by local authorities on their residents, Kan 
Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission, told a press conference 
called to correct his comments. 
  Earlier, the head of the advisory panel to the prime 
minister 
told reporters, "It's not necessary now" to include the 
consumption tax rate as long as the package includes the timing 
of the hike. 
  The consumption tax, currently 3 percent, is levied on 
practically all goods and services. 
  Kato's earlier statement was apparently aimed at mollifying 
members of the ruling coalition -- most notably the Social 
Democratic Party [of Japan] -- who are strongly opposed to 
raising the consumption tax rate. 
  His retraction came after the Finance Ministry objected that 
his comments could be interpreted as virtually allowing a tax 
cut to be carried out separately from hiking the consumption tax. 
  Kato said the tax cut will stimulate the economy even if a 
consumption tax hike is included in the package for later 
implementation. 
  "The tax cut might have been ineffective last year, but 
would 
be effective this year" with the economy "starting to show signs 
of hitting bottom," he said. 
  A consumption tax hike would therefore not undermine 
consumption, and the government and politicians should clearly 
state the "consumption tax rate and its timing" in the proposed 
tax law to guarantee repayment of "bridge" bonds to fund the tax 
cut, Kato said. 
  He said the argument that a consumption tax hike would 
dampen 
consumption is "absolutely a fiction," especially in Japan where 
savings are still high compared with other countries. 
  "Last-minute" spending can be expected, as happened in China 
when the government there announced in December a new 
consumption tax, he said, adding the panel is to study the 
Chinese case. 
  Many computer simulations show that the economy may "suffer 
sluggish consumption for six months to a year" after the 
spending spree subsides, but will "recover in the following 
year," he said. 
  Japanese politicians and U.S. Government officials have 
voiced concerns that a tax cut would be ineffective if linked to 
a future consumption tax hike. 
  Referring to opinions that an income tax cut would spur 
economic recovery, leading to increased tax revenues, Kato said 
such a scenario has been proven wrong in the United States under 
the administration of President Ronald Reagan. 
  Concerning deficit-covering bonds, he said, "Bridge bonds 
are 
for repayment in the short term, and it's irresponsible... to 
borrow without any scheme for paying back." 
  "Politicians may not win votes with a consumption tax 
hike...but those who correct public views instead of just 
following them are the true politicians," he said. 
  As for signs of the economy hitting bottom, he cited 
recovering spending mainly on housing resulting from lower land 
prices, impact of the yen's exchange rate changing favorably for 
Japanese companies, and an expected increase in automobile 
purchases because of a cut in the tax on automobile sales. 
  He also said the bribery scandals involving general 
contractors that have held up public works projects are "near 
settlement," and the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of 
multilateral trade talks may lead to lower prices. 
  Meanwhile, a senior member of the tax panel told reporters 
the panel cannot support any issuance of deficit-covering bonds 
and wants the government to launch the tax cut and hike in a 
single law. 
  But the panel, which resumed discussing the tax reform 
Friday 
after a break since mid-December, confirmed its stance of 
"leaving the decision to the government and coalition parties," 
he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
  As for a timetable, the panel will meet on Tuesday and 
Friday 
next week and hold meetings almost evevy day from the following 
week with a target of issuing final proposals by the end of 
January, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 18 KYODO -- The government's economic 
pump-priming package will be unveiled next Monday [24 January] 
at the earliest, Japan's top economic planner said Tuesday. 
  The seven ruling coalition parties are trying to coordinate 
their views on "the one pending issue" in writing the package, 
Economic Planning Agency [EPA] Director General Manae Kubota 
told a regular press conference. 
  Kubota was referring to a dispute among the seven parties 
over whether a consumption tax hike should be included in the 
package to cover proposed income tax cuts. 
  The Social Democratic Party [of Japan], the largest of the 
seven, has been strongly opposed to raising the consumption tax 
rate from the current 3 percent. 
  The coalition parties are prepared to "do all they can" 
toward this weekend in order to prevent a further delay in 
formation of economic steps, Kubota said. 
  She said a third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 to 
finance the new economic package will be formulated along with 
the announcement of the economic measures.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 18 KYODO -- Japan's top labor leader 
called Tuesday [18 January] for income tax cuts of nearly 10 
trillion yen as part of the government's economic stimulus 
package. 
  Akira Yamagishi, chairman of the Japanese Trade Union 
Confederation (Rengo) with eight million members, made the 
appeal in a speech at a seminar hosted by the Federation of 
Employers Associations (Nikkeiren) in Urayasu, Chiba Prefecture. 
  Yamagishi said the political survival of the ruling 
coalition 
government under Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa may be at a 
risk if it fails to implement the major tax cuts.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 17 KYODO -- A project team formed by 
the seven parties in Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
coalition government proposed Monday [17 January] that real 
estate taxes be eased to stimulate land transactions, officials 
said. 
  The proposal was contained in a report submitted to a 
policy-adjustment panel of the ruling parties by the project 
team on real estate and housing, the officials said. 
  The report proposes easing taxes on real estate dealings and 
on real estate held for use for public projects, they said. 
  It also calls for promotion of real estate purchases by 
government agencies for housing projects and an increase of 
funds for housing loans by the government-financed Housing Loan 
Corp., the officials said. 
  Relaxation of restrictions on housing construction are also 
proposed, they said. 
  The policy-adjustment panel will take into account the 
proposals in working out a program for tax system reforms for 
fiscal 1994, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 18 KYODO -- An advisory panel in the 
Posts and Telecommunications Ministry on Tuesday [18 January] 
approved rate cuts for mobile telephone services proposed by 
telecom firms, ministry officials said. 
  The officials said applications for rate reductions for 
automobile, portable and other mobile telephone services have 
come from 27 companies, including NTT Mobile Communications 
Network Inc., a subsidiary of domestic telecom giant Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. 
  The applications were approved by the Telecommunications 
Council, an advisory panel to the posts and telecommunications 
minister, they said. 
  The officials said the proposed rate cuts will amount to 
about 40 percent for basic monthly subscription fees and about 
15 percent for initiation charges. 
  The rate reductions will take effect in April, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 14 KYODO -- The government will relax a 
restriction that works as a virtual ban on companies buying back 
their own shares, government sources said Friday [14 January]. 
  The government has been studying the move as a means to help 
absorb excess shares in the market and boost sluggish share 
prices, they said. 
  The surplus shares, issued during the "bubble economy" 
period 
in the late 1980s, have been blamed for keeping the stock prices 
depressed. 
  According to the government's plans to revise the commercial 
code, companies hoping to buy back their own shares will be 
first required to change their articles of association with 
approval from more than two-thirds of their shareholders. 
  So far, such a change has required approval from all the 
shareholders, a rule that has served as a major obstacle. 
  Then they will have to put a buyback proposal to another 
vote 
that would require approval by more than half of the 
shareholders. 
  The shares to be bought back will have to be purchased on 
the 
stock market with the companies' own funds. No borrowing will 
be allowed for that purpose. 
  Up to 3 percent of the outstanding shares is the ceiling set 
for such purchases. 
  In addition, the shares so bought cannot be sold to third 
parties and must to be sold to in-house shareholding 
organizations of employees within one year, the sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 17 KYODO -- The Transport Ministry on 
Monday [17 January] added an additional 130 items to the list of 
its deregulation program, ministry officials said. 
  The 130 items, all concerning permits and licenses, came on 
top of 400 items for deregulation the ministry submitted last 
November. 
  The ministry officials said the total of 530 items, if 
realized, will help reduce the ministry's work on permits and 
licenses by about 15 percent compared with the end of March 1992. 
  The additional list, which the ministry submitted to the 
Management and Coordination Agency on Monday, includes the 
scrapping of 50 permits and licenses and easier regulations on 
80 permits and licenses. 
  For instance, a regulation regarding the changing of names 
of 
ships will be done away with, while airlines and other transport 
firms will not have to seek government approval but only report 
when they want to introduce discount tickets. 
  The latest deregulation plans require revision of about 10 
laws. The ministry plans to present bills for the legal revision 
in the next ordinary session of the Diet starting late this 
month for implementation in the summer.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 18 KYODO -- Japan should allow domestic 
telecommunications firms to provide both domestic and overseas 
services, a government advisory panel said Tuesday [18 January]. 
  In a report submitted to Posts and Telecommunications 
Minister Takenori Kanzaki, the Telecommunications Council also 
recommended scrapping restrictions on foreign ownership of 
telecommunications concerns. 
  The ministry is expected to implement the proposals as early 
as this summer. 
  Under the existing rules, domestic telecommunications firms 
are prohibited from offering both domestic and overseas services 
at the same time regarding satellite communications. They also 
limit foreign ownership of telecommunications companies to less 
than one-third. 
  But Japan has been under growing pressure from abroad to 
relax rules on foreign telecommunications concerns, as foreign 
enterprises step up satellite telecommunications services.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 14 KYODO -- The 1993 crop of rice 
inspected for sale under government control at the end of last 
year fell 36 percent from a year earlier to 4,005,000 tons, the 
food agency said Friday [14 January]. 
  The decrease rate was steeper than the 26 percent fall in 
the 
national rice harvest, which totaled 7,834,000 tons, the agency 
said. 
  This shows a large portion of the harvest is being marketed 
freely outside government channels, with rice prices surging due 
to the poorest rice crop last year since World War II, officials 
said. 
  Of the total of unpolished nonglutinous and glutinous rice 
inspected, paddy-grown nonglutinous rice decreased 37 percent to 
3,778,000 tons.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 17 KYODO -- Ichiro Ozawa, the 
governing coalition's chief tactician, on Monday [17 January] 
ended his two-month-long, all-out war with the media and resumed 
his regular news conferences. 
  "Today I resume my press conferences as were held 
previously," Ozawa told a crowd of reporters, breaking silence 
for the first time since November 8 last year. 
  Reflecting Ozawa's political clout, a number of reporters 
asked the Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) secretary general for 
comment on wide-ranging issues. 
  Ozawa said nothing new, however, sidestepping all questions 
on his alleged entanglement in a widening money scandal 
involving the nation's leading general contractors. 
  Concerning 5 million yen he accepted from scandal-ridden 
Kajima Corp. in December 1992, the coalition's key strategist 
repeated his earlier statements that he took the cash as a legal 
political donation, not as a back-door fund. 
  In the November 8 press briefing, he acknowledged the 
acceptance of the money but stated he received the 5 million yen 
in accordance with the law. 
  Ozawa had since refused to hold news conferences following 
the clash between him and the press, which first broke in 
October. 
  The row erupted after Ozawa barred the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 
and the SANKEI SHIMBUN from his regular press conferences, 
accusing the national dailies of carrying inaccurate stories 
without asking him for comment. 
  Ozawa dismissed demands by journalists from the two news 
organizations and 14 others to lift the ban, insisting his news 
conferences were "a service to the press" rather than a duty to 
the public. 
  The lawmaker, who is said to have masterminded the ouster of 
the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) from power last August, had 
scrapped the practice of holding briefings with reporters on his 
beat and met the press only at his "open" news conference. 
  The journalists from 16 major Japanese news organizations 
insisted Ozawa's action ran counter to his policy of opening his 
press conferences to all media, including magazines and foreign 
media. 
  At the outset of Monday's 30-minute press briefing, Ozawa 
said he decided to resume his news conferences because he and 
the 16 news organizations reached an accord that they will try 
to resolve future differences through dialogue. 
  On the issue of political reform, he voiced confidence in 
the 
passage of a package of government-sponsored political reform 
bills before the current Diet session ends January 29. 
  Ozawa said that after the passage of the reform legislation, 
on whose enactment Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has staked 
his political fate, economy-spurring measures and administrative 
reform would be high on the agenda. 
  He declined comment on a reported shakeup of the Hosokawa 
cabinet after the passage of the reform package, saying only 
that the premier has the authority to reshuffle the cabinet. 
  Last June, Ozawa broke away from the LDP with his loyalists 
to create Shinseito, which subsequently joined hands with six 
other parties to deprive the LDP of its 38-year hold on power.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 17 KYODO -- Three outside experts 
recommended by the ruling and opposition parties to give their 
views on political reform bills urged the Diet on Monday [17 
January] to enact the measures during the current session. 
  They made the plea to the House of Councillors on the first 
day of hearings in which members of the public give their views 
on the issue -- a prerequisite before the bills can be out to a 
vote on the floor of the upper chamber. 
  The bills, designed to rid politics of corruption, cleared 
the more powerful House of Representatives last November. 
  The ruling coalition last month extended the current Diet 
session by 45 days until January 29 to achieve Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's target to get the reform bills into law by 
the end of the parliament session. 
  Osamu Nishi, a professor at Komazawa University, Miyagi Gov. 
Shiro Asano and former upper house member Mitsuyoshi Yajima 
expressed their views on the issue at the morning session of the 
public hearing held in Tokyo prior to Tuesday's hearings in five 
provincial cities. 
  Nishi, recommended by the main opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP), said that if the Diet fails to legislate the bills, 
which could be enacted with a little more effort, the people's 
distrust in politics will deepen. 
  Nishi urged both ruling and opposition parties to move 
closer 
to each other, saying, "it is important to find a compromise." 
  Asano, recommended by the ruling coalition, said "there is 
no 
system that is 100 percent perfect, but if (the bills) have an 
ounce of ideals, I want (the Diet) to enact them during the 
current session." 
  Yajima, also recommended by the coalition, rapped movements 
in the Diet against the bills. 
  On amending the bills, however, Yajima urged the Diet to 
take 
enough time to make whatever improvements are possible, 
suggesting the next regular Diet session, slated to start in 
late January, should tackle the matter. 
  The bills call for replacing the current multiseat 
constituencies for the 511-member lower house with a mixture of 
274 seats elected through single-seat districts and 226 through 
nationwide proportional representation, as well as tightening 
curbs on fund- raising activities. 
  The existing electoral system is believed to be a major 
cause 
of lavish campaign spending because of competition among 
candidates of the same party in single districts, while the 
current political fund control law is seen as having loopholes 
that make it possible for politicians to escape punishment for 
wrongdoing. 
  Meanwhile, the coalition reaffirmed Monday that it will call 
a vote on the bills at Wednesday's session of the upper house's 
political reform committee, a crucial step prior to a vote of 
the full house. 
  At a meeting of leaders from the government and coalition 
parties, Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the largest coalition 
member, the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], 
reaffirmed a desire to conclude upper house debate on political 
reform on Wednesday, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio 
Hatoyama said. 
  Kubo, who heads the coalition's task force on political 
reform, was quoted as saying the date to put the reform measures 
through the upper house panel should be decided Monday even if 
the opposition disagrees. 
  The coalition will have to set the date by submitting an 
emergency motion to the upper house panel, Kubo was quoted as 
saying. 
  The LDP, on the other hand, will propose to the coalition 
the 
holding of a meeting aimed at amending the bills so that the two 
sides can come closer on the political reform process, LDP 
officials said. 
  Senior LDP members of the upper house committee are expected 
to make the proposal to their coalition counterparts on Monday 
evening, they said. 
  The ratio of single-seat districts in the dual system, the 
electoral unit for proportional representation, and corporate 
political donations are major contentious issues between the two 
sides. 
  In the 252-seat upper house, the ruling coalition has 131 
seats, while the LDP holds 99, the Japanese Communist Party 
(JCP) 11, the Niin Club five and independents five. 
  Several upper house members of the SDP have expressed 
opposition to the bills and could vote against them or abstain, 
greatly weakening the coalition's chances of passing the bills 
in the upper house.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 17 KYODO -- The main strategist of 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition on Monday [17 
January] expressed confidence that four government-sponsored 
political reform bills will become law in the current Diet 
session. 
  "I do not expect the legislation to be voted down," Ichiro 
Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], 
said at a news conference, referring to the voting on the reform 
bills at a House of Councillors plenary session expected later 
this week. 
  Ozawa said most people must long for the enactment of 
political reforms in the current extraordinary Diet session, 
which ends January 29. 
  On possible talks between the ruling coalition and the main 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to seek a compromise 
on the final shape of the reform legislation, he said the LDP 
should prepare its own compromise plan before seeking 
negotiations with the coalition. 
  "Discussion for modifications should be premised on the 
LDP's 
pledge to achieve reform during the current Diet sitting and its 
presentation of specific areas for possible fine-tuning," he 
said. 
  The government package, featuring a rearrangement of the 
electoral system for the House of Representatives and stricter 
curbs on campaign funding, cleared the lower house in 
mid-November. 
  Hosokawa has vowed to achieve political reform by the close 
of the current Diet session. 
  Obstacles to passage of the bills remain, however, with some 
upper house members of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] 
the largest force in the ruling coalition, opposed to certain 
aspects of the package. 
  Ozawa, a former LDP secretary general, is said to have 
masterminded the formation of the seven-party coalition last 
August after he and his followers quit the LDP and inaugurated 
Shinseito in June. 
  He said he believes additional pump-priming measures and 
administrative reform will be two major tasks for the Hosokawa 
government in the event of passage of the political reform 
package. 
  Monday's news conference was Ozawa's first in about two 
months. He had refused to speak to the media on the grounds that 
two national dailies carried inaccurate reports of his press 
conferences.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 17 KYODO -- The chairman of a House of 
Councillors political reform committee said Monday [17 January] 
he will wrap up debate on a package of government-proposed 
political reform bills on the committee floor Wednesday. 
  Yubun Ueno's comment paves the way for voting on the bills 
by 
the committee later the same day. 
  "I decided to hold a panel session on January 19 prior to a 
final vote," Ueno said. 
  The government and the seven-party ruling coalition have 
been 
trying to force the bills through the committee by Wednesday and 
through the House of Councillors by Friday at the latest. 
  The opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) proposed a 
plan 
to modify 10 points in the government's bills as a condition for 
endorsing them, but the coalition rejected them and is ready to 
get the bills through the committee and an upper house plenary 
session without any revision. 
  The bills cleared the more powerful House of Representatives 
on November 18. 
  Two of the 10 points demanded by the LDP are a continuation 
of donations by enterprises and groups to individual politicians 
and a ban on visits by candidates to the homes of voters. 
  The LDP also called for revising the system whereby votes 
are 
counted by treating the whole of Japan as an electoral district 
for proportional representation in lower house elections. 
  The government bills allow candidates to visit voters' homes 
for 12 hours from 8 A.M. during campaign days and bar firms and 
groups from donating money to individual politicians. 
  The government wants 274 single-seat districts and 226 seats 
decided by proportional representation, cutting the current 
total of 511 seats in the lower house to 500. 
  The lower chamber killed the LDP-proposed bills on November 
18. 
  The bills, designed to revamp Japan's corruption-tainted 
politics, set the amount of public money available annually for 
political activities at 30.9 billion yen, a figure proposed by 
the LDP, down from the coalition's initial proposal of 41.4 
billion yen. 
  The upper house delayed deliberation of the government's 
bills after they cleared the lower house, and the Diet voted 
December 15 to extend for 45 days beyond the deadline of the 
90-day session to January 29.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 18 KYODO -- The main opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) formulated on Tuesday [18 January] its 
1994 draft action program that lambastes the ruling coalition 
and shows the party's desire to recapture the reins of 
government. 
  The draft action program, subtitled, "Let's Win Back Power 
and Do Our Best To Boost the Economy so as To Protect the 
National Life," is scheduled to be adopted at the LDP's annual 
convention on Friday. 
  According to the draft plan, the LDP, toppled from power 
last 
August after 38 years in power, describes the government of 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa as "a weird government filled 
with deception and contradiction." 
  The LDP asserts its fall from power is not attributable to 
its mistakes on policy matters but to its defectors' move to 
join hands with other parties in their lust for power, the draft 
says, referring to an LDP splinter, Shinseito (Japan Renewal 
Party). 
  It says the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], 
the largest force in the seven-party coalition, is remote from 
other partners on its stance on basic policies such as 
diplomacy, national security and the partial opening of Japan's 
rice market. 
  In the plan, the LDP also slams coalition member party 
Komeito for its alleged violation of the Constitution which 
stipulates the separation of religion and politics. Komeito is 
backed by a Soka Gakkai, a Buddhist lay organization. 
  The presence of the SDP and Komeito in the coalition "puts 
the Hosokawa cabinet in imminent danger," the draft argues. 
  In a thinly disguised reference to Shinseito Secretary 
General Ichiro Ozawa, who is said to be controlling Hosokawa 
from behind the scenes, it says the coalition has shown the 
"dictatorial nature" through its management of political and 
other issues. 
  On political reform, the draft action program says the 
now-deposed LDP will seek further modifications of a package of 
government-sponsored reform measures in its favor and push them 
through in the current extraordinary Diet session, due to end on 
January 29. 
  The reform legislation, aimed at rooting out rampant 
political corruption, cleared the House of Representatives in 
mid-November and is pending in the House of Councillors. 
  The LDP and the coalition still remain apart on the final 
shape of the bills, including the balance between single-seat 
constituencies and the proportional representation system for 
new lower house elections. 
  To ensure its comeback to power, according to the draft, the 
LDP should repent from its lawmakers' involvement in an array of 
past scandals, boost its self-cleansing power and give strong 
discretion and power to the party president and party 
organizations. 
  The draft program calls for the LDP to continue its stance 
against turning Japan into a military superpower in favor of 
amendments to the Constitution. 
  Noting Japan should occupy a permanent seat on the United 
Nations Security Council, the LDP will raise awareness of 
Japanese people on the matter, the draft says.

  [Text] Yangon [Rangoon], Jan. 17 KYODO -- Myanmar's 
[Burma's] ruling military junta may release opposition leader 
Aung San Suu Kyi, under house arrest since July 1989, in July 
this year, a Myanmar official said Monday [17 January]. 
  Khin Nyunt, first secretary of Myanmar's State Law and Order 
Restoration Council, told Japanese reporters that the legitimate 
period of her house arrest will expire in July. Myanmar's law 
limits the period of house arrest to a maximum of five years. 
  Aung San Suu Kyi, 48, a Nobel peace prize laureate, led the 
National League for Democracy (NLD) to a landslide victory in 
the 1991 general election but was denied the power to head the 
government.

<F P=106> [Dispatch from correspondent Larry Jagan] </F>
  [Text] According to news from the Thai-Burma border, the 
Karen National Union [KNU] has detained Moe Thee Zun and 11 
members of his group which had split from the Burmese students 
movement. According to the report, the students were invited to 
a meeting by Karen leaders at a place 45 minutes by boat on the 
river from their camp. When they arrived in Manerplaw, Karen 
soldiers took the students to a guerrilla training camp near 
their headquarters. 
  KNU leader, General Mya, in the presence of top-level KNU 
officials, told the students group that the KNU would hold 
cease- fire talks as planned with the Burmese Government. 
Furthermore, Gen. Mya informed the student group not to 
obstruct or protest against the talks in any way and told them 
to watch from the sidelines. The students on their part had 
consistently opposed peace talks with the Burmese Government. 
  According to an opposition source at the border, the 12 
students are still being detained. The KNU spokesman in Bangkok 
has denied the report on the above incident. He said the 
incident was merely a repercussion of the split within the ABSDF 
[All Burma Students Democratic Front] since 1991. There has 
been tension between the DAB [Democratic Alliance of Burma] and 
the students group in recent months. The DAB, which was formed 
with 15 opposition organizations, includes the 
goverment-in-exile headed by Dr. Sein Win. 
  According to reports received in the past week, the students 
group had been openly voicing their criticism following the 
agreement by four major armed ethnic organizations and the 
Burmese Government to hold peace talks. The group was reported 
to have severely criticized the Karen organization for its talks 
at the DAB emergency meeting held in Manerplaw this week. At 
the same time, some members of the armed students organization, 
the All Burma Students Democratic Front [ABSDF], were reported 
to have left Karen territory with their weapons without 
informing the Karens. KNU officers have told the students to 
return the weapons they have armed them with. 
  According to an additional report, the Karenni Progressive 
Party is reported to have disarmed the ABSDF faction which had 
been staying with the Karenni organization.

<F P=106> [Declaration issued at an emergency meeting of the </F>
Democratic Alliance of Burma Central Committee in Manerplaw on 
14 January] 
  [Text] The secretary-1 of the SLORC [State Law and Order 
Restoration Council] expressed the SLORC's desire to meet with 
jungle-based armed organizations in Loikaw, Kayah State, on 17 
November 1993. The DAB [Democratic Alliance of Burma] believed 
that this desire to meet with jungle-based armed organizations 
would be worthwhile if it was intended to establish internal 
peace in Burma. That is why DAB Chairman General Saw Bo Mya 
proposed holding an official meeting between the DAB and the 
SLORC in a letter to SLORC Chairman Senior General Than Shwe 
dated 1 December 1993. The SLORC responded to this letter 
verbally, saying it would not meet or hold discussions with the 
DAB or the NDF [National Democratic Front]; it would only meet 
and hold discussions with individual jungle-based armed 
organizations. In this regard, the DAB Central Committee's 
emergency meeting, held from 11 to 14 January, has issued the 
following declaration to the local and international community: 
  1. The underlying problems -- the civil war and the lack of 
peace and stability in Burma -- are directly related to the 
political forces, national peoples, and public in the country. 
These problems are also directly related and connected to the 
state's constitutional system and the state's fundamental 
political policies. Separate and secret meetings between the 
SLORC and certain organizations will not produce the correct 
solution to these problems. Such separate and secret meetings 
will not produce a nationwide cease-fire or a genuine and firm 
internal peace. They will only produce a more dangerous 
situation for the country. 
  2. At the moment, there is a serious need to establish 
genuine national solidarity in Burma. In order to establish 
genuine and firm national solidarity, a plenary session of all 
political forces is required so that free, frank, and fair 
discussions can be held. Separate and secret meetings run 
completely counter to genuine and firm national solidarity; they 
are an abnormal act. 
  3. The DAB has no desire whatsoever for civil war. [Word 
indistinct], the DAB believes that the political issues that 
create and augment civil war need to be removed. The DAB deeply 
believes that the process of removing these political issues has 
to be based on the basic political interests and desires of the 
national peoples and the entire populace, and that the problems 
have to be resolved by political means. That is why the DAB has 
honestly struggled and is still struggling to achieve genuine 
internal peace. 
  4. The SLORC's excuse that it cannot meet with the DAB 
because of the different political objectives among the DAB's 
members is not a strong or valid reason. The DAB has one basic 
political objective. It is not just the DAB; the majority of 
political forces, all national peoples, and the entire public in 
the country -- regardless of organizational affiliation, race, 
religion, or region -- have the same political objective. This 
objective is to establish a genuine, democratic, federal union 
[federal pyidaungsu thamada naing-ngan]. The whole country is 
opposed to the SLORC and is fighting against it. Therefore, it 
is clear that not only the DAB, but the [word indistinct] people 
have the same political objective. 
  5. Meetings and discussions, as well as any internal peace, 
that overlook the fundamental political interests of the 
national peoples and the public have no meaning. Only the 
concerted effort and struggle of all peace-loving forces can 
produce a genuine internal peace and resolve political problems 
by political means. Therefore, the DAB will continue its 
struggle for a genuine and firm internal peace that can 
guarantee the fundamental political interests of the national 
peoples and the public by firmly joining hands with all people 
and patriots. 
  [Signed] Central Committee, Democratic Alliance of Burma; 
Central Headquarters, Manerplaw. 
  [Dated] 14 January 1994.

  [Text] Not long after Bosnia erupted into civil war 21 
months ago, the international community gambled that if it could 
fudge its commitment to peacekeeping long enough, the conflict 
would sooner or later fizzle out and be forgotten. It has not 
paid off; instead, with each passing day the stakes have 
increased to a point where the poverty of conscience is 
bordering on ennui. The impatience of the major powers in the 
shambolic [as published] Bosnian peacekeeping operation to 
consign the tragedy to remote memory has left them questioning 
themselves about how little they can get by with in dealing with 
the Bosnias of the future. With their default over Bosnia more 
or less a done deal, the NATO countries at their summit last 
week hastened to reassure themselves that the Atlantic alliance 
could still uphold lofty principle on elaborate pretense alone. 
  For while the post-Cold War world resolves its geopolitics 
in 
the absence of a clear definition of friend and foe, it is 
pretentious to assume that self-interest is anything less than 
paramount. Both France and Britain, the main participating 
nations in the Bosnian peacekeeping presence, have hinted that 
that interest would not be further served by exposing their 
troops in an inconclusive conflict. Those troops might be 
withdrawn if no agreement is reached by the spring -- it would 
be pointless to stay on when the injustice of the carve-up plan 
has been conceded as a given. The Bosnian Government cannot 
accept the residue of their country as offered so far, and have 
no choice but to keep on fighting. With its back against the 
wall, it had been prepared to yield up to two-thirds of its 
territory in return for a face-saving and economically viable 
peace. Between immolation and a humiliating vestige of their 
former sovereignty, the Bosnian Muslims are making the only 
dignified choice. Having stayed neutral on the terms of a peace 
settlement, the Europeans see no point in turning their token 
gestures into sitting ducks. 
  Apart from the extremist elements, the Bosnian Muslims know 
that they cannot win back all that they have lost. The realists 
hope to regain the bulk of central Bosnia and wrest by force the 
minimal concessions that they had thus far failed to obtain by 
negotiation. The greatest irony of the West's dereliction over 
the Bosnia issue is that the basis for their inaction has not 
come to bear -- the conflict did not end quickly. It is now 
safe to conjecture that had the arms embargo been lifted, the 
fighting would have taken less time to come to a truce, with an 
eventual deadlocked armistice. No matter how tense such an armed 
stand-off might have been, it would have been wrought at less 
suffering. Ethno-religious rivalry exacts greater attrition the 
longer it is left to fester. The sooner an impasse is reached 
with reasonable grounds staked out, the more amenable will the 
combatants be to a practical detente. 
  Such "what if's" will no doubt keep historians busy in time 
to come. What would make them busier still is the external and 
incidental costs of the international community's betrayal of 
principle. It is already obvious to most Muslims worldwide that 
their interests are incompatible with those of that community's 
Western leaders, vaunted principles notwithstanding. The scale 
of Bosnia's neglect might be small enough to be easily 
forgotten. But the religious sectarianism with which that 
conflict was fought will be remembered for a long time yet.

  [Text] Kota Kinabalu, Jan 17 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- The High 
Court here Monday fined Chief Minister of the eastern Malaysian 
state Joseph Pairin Kitingan 1,800 ringgit (U.S. $660) in 
default six months' jail after finding him guilty of using his 
position to award a shophouse project in his constituency of 
Tambunan to a company in which his brothers-in-law had interests. 
  Justice Denis Ong Jiew Fook of the Miri High Court passed 
the 
sentence after hearing mitigation from Pairin's counsel, Raja 
Aziz Adruse, and a reply from senior federal counsel Abdul Gani 
Patail. 
  He took about an hour and 21 minutes to decide on the 
sentence which was greeted with loud applause from the public 
gallery. 
  The charge under Section (1) of the Emergency (Essential 
Cases) Ordinance 1970, carries a maximum fine of 20,000 ringgit 
or a jail term not exceeding 14 years, or both upon conviction. 
  Pairin, 53, was found guilty of using his position as the 
chief minister to commit a corrupt practice by approving a 
1.48-million ringgit contract for the Sabah Economic Development 
Corporation's shophouse project in Tambunan to Rimkaya Co. Ltd., 
in which his relatives were the directors-cum-shareholders. 
  He committed the offence at his office in the Sabah 
Foundation building in Likas here, on September 11, 1985. 
  During the trial, which lasted 96 days, the prosecution 
witnesses testified that Justin Alip and Jude Edward Kessy were 
Pairin's brothers-in-law and Rimkaya's 
directors-cum-shareholders. 
  Pairin, in his defence, said he was not aware that any of 
his 
brothers-in-law was involved with Rimkaya which was given the 
second phase of Tambunan shophouse contract. 
  He was defended by Anthony Scrivener, QC [Queen Counsel], 
Raja Aziz Addruse, Douglas Primus, Datuk Chau Chin Tang, and 
James Tsai, while Gani prosecuted, assisted by Ahmad Bache.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur -- Foreign Minister Professor S. 
Jayakumar yesterday said that both Singapore and Malaysia should 
find ways of expanding contacts at all levels. 
  Speaking to THE SUNDAY TIMES before flying home after a 
two-day visit, he said that such a move was necessary because of 
the changed circumstances. 
  In the past, he said that many Malaysians and Singaporeans 
studied together at Raffles College and the University of Malaya 
in Singapore. 
  As this was no longer happening, he said that it was 
important for the two countries to make concerted attempts to 
build new links. 
  Prof. Jayakumar said that his Malaysian counterpart, Datuk 
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, whom he met on Friday also agreed on the 
need to step up contacts. 
  Both felt that bilateral ties were very good and that 
outstanding issues between the two countries could be resolved. 
  As an example, he said that they noted that discussions 
between both countries were being conducted on two issues on the 
same day as their meeting. 
  They were the disputes over the ownership of Pedra Branca, 
on 
which stands the Horsburgh Lighthouse and which Singapore has 
administered for the past 150 years, and the delineation of the 
Straits of Johor. 
  "We were both optimistic that such issues could be 
resolved," 
he said. 
  Datuk Abdullah, who was present to bid farewell to Prof. 
Jayakumar, interjected that the current approach was the best. 
"Leave it to the present mechanism," he added. 
  Prof. Jayakumar took the opportunity of stressing to his 
Malaysian counterpart the value he attached to the 
Singapore-Malaysia relationship. 
  "With good relations, it will be easier to view in 
perspective the occasional hiccup that may erupt from time to 
time," he added. 
  Prof. Jayakumar, who is also law minister, was on his first 
overseas trip since he took over the portfolio in a cabinet 
reshuffle earlier this month. 
  He said that his visit was in line with the tradition for a 
newly appointed minister to call on his ASEAN counterpart and to 
establish personal rapport. 
  Prof. Jayakumar, who first met his Malaysian counterpart 
about 10 years ago, said that he attached great importance to 
personal ties as they formed a vital ingredient in establishing 
a good working relationship. 
  Datuk Abdullah has accepted an invitation from his Singapore 
counterpart to visit the republic later this year. 
  Other Malaysian leaders whom Prof. Jayakumar met were Law 
Minister Datuk Syed Hamid Albar and Deputy Home Affairs Minister 
Datuk Megat Junid Megat Ayub.

<F P=106> ["Nuclear Issue on Korean Peninsula Can Be Solved Only </F>
Through DPRK-U.S. Talks" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 16 (KCNA) -- The nuclear issue on 
the Korean peninsula is a matter which can be solved only 
through talks between the DPRK and the United States in view of 
its background or its character, says NODONG SINMUN today. 
  The nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula has been raised 
since the United States deployed nuclear weapons in South Korea 
against the DPRK and it has become all the more grave matter 
with continued nuclear threat to the Korean people from the 
ground, sea and sky with South Korea as the largest nuclear 
forward base in the Far East, the paper points out, and 
continues: 
  The United States is the very one who creates nuclear threat 
on the Korean peninsula and the DPRK is the victim who is 
exposed to the nuclear threat for scores of years. 
  The DPRK and the United States are the parties concerned who 
are mainly responsible and have authority to settle the nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula. This matter, therefore, can be 
solved through dialogue and negotiations between the United 
States, maker of nuclear threat against us, and the DPRK, a 
victim. 
  At the first round of the talks, both sides discussed and 
agreed on the matters of principle in the solution of the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and made public a joint 
statement, and at the second round of the talks, the sides 
discussed practical steps to implement the principles agreed 
upon in the joint statement. But the third round of the talks 
has been long deadlocked by moves of the Western insound [as 
received] forces and their followers. 
  Out of the desire to fundamentally solve on an equal and 
fair 
basis the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula, the DPRK side 
put forward a formula of package dealing and has consistently 
made efforts for an agreement at working-level contacts between 
both sides. 
  At the 18th DPRK-U.S. contact held on December 29 last year, 
the sides agreed to discuss in a package deal the issues for a 
fundamental solution of the nuclear problem. 
  The DPRK-U.S. contacts show that the nuclear problem on the 
Korean peninsula can be solved in a fair and peaceful way when 
both sides display the spirit of mutual understanding and 
cooperation. 
  A fair solution to the nuclear problem on the Korean 
peninsula favours the interest of the U.S. itself. 
  The lesson of the DPRK-U.S. contacts since the second round 
of the talks is that the matter can never be untangled by means 
of resorting to delaying tactics or putting pressure, placing 
unreasonable precondition and, moreover, the threat and hostile 
act infringing upon the dignity and sovereignty of the partner 
of dialogue will lead the situation to a catastrophe. 
  If the principles already agreed upon between the DPRK and 
the United States are observed and implemented, the nuclear 
problem on the Korean peninsula would be solved fairly.

<F P=106> ["Imprudent Utterances of Nuclear War Servant" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 16 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Yong-sam, when he met the U.S. assistant secretary of state a 
few days ago, said that suspicion of nuclear production in the 
North cannot be removed by such a mere fact as continuity of 
safeguards, and a spokesman of the puppet Foreign Ministry 
rattled that though there was progress in the DPRK-US contact, a 
solution cannot be found overnight and that they cannot hastily 
believe the North. 
  NODONG SINMUN today says they uttered this from a 
cantankerous intention to lay hurdles in the DPRK-U.S. talks 
and hinder the settlement of the nuclear problem, not satisfied 
with the fact that the DPRK and the United States agreed to hold 
the third round of the talks and discuss in a package deal the 
issues for a fundamental solution of the nuclear problem. 
  The news analyst goes on: 
  If the Kim Yong-sam clique really wants the denuclearization 
of the Korean peninsula for the sake of the nation, it should 
welcome the successful progress of the DPRK-U.S. talks and do 
favourable for it. However, the South Korean puppets are 
misbehaving themselves, not satisfied with the DPRK-U.S. talks 
because their attempt to realise an "international cooperation 
system" and take sanction against the fellow countrymen may 
fail. Furthermore, it stems from a criminal attempt to obstruct 
the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and 
leave South Korea to the mercy of the United States as a nuclear 
base. 
  As to the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula, it was 
raised as the United States shipped nuclear weapons into South 
Korea. 
  If the traitor Kim Yong-sam worries a little about the 
destiny of the fellow countrymen and really wants the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, he should not make 
much ado about the settlement of the fictitious nuclear issue in 
the North but take issue with the U.S. nuclear weapons and 
bases in South Korea and talk about the question of their 
withdrawal and dismantlement. 
  He is making a noise about the fictitious nuclear issue of 
the North in a bid to find a pretext for putting out of argument 
the U.S. nuclear weapons in South Korea to keep them and 
justifying his move to develop nuclear weapons. 
  He should keep in mind that it precipitates his self-ruin to 
keep North-South relations in a state of sharp confrontation and 
rupture, taking issue with the unfamiliar "nuclear problem of 
the North" at other's beck and call though he has no actual 
power to resolve the nuclear problem.

<F P=106> [Press statement (tamhwa) issued by Yang Hyong-sop, </F>
alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Workers Party of 
Korea Central Committee and chairman of the Supreme People's 
Assembly, on 15 January; place not given -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Today our nation is faced with the important task of 
advancing the cause of the fatherland's reunification through 
the united strength of the whole nation. 
  In his historical New Year's address, the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song taught that all Korean fellow countrymen of 
the North, South, and overseas must unite as one under the 
banner of the great national unity to carry out the nationwide 
struggle so that a new phase can be opened this year in the 
fatherland's reunification. 
  Currently, our people are infinitely encouraged by the great 
leader's New Year's address and are vigorously carrying out the 
struggle to achieve the country's socialist construction and the 
fatherland's reunification starting with the beginning of the 
year. The South Korean people and fellow countrymen overseas are 
also actively taking part in the struggle to achieve 
reunification in the nineties embraced with the new enthusiasm 
for the fatherland's reunification. 
  Right at this time, in his New Year's news conference on 12 
January, Yi Ki-taek, executive chairman of South Korea's 
Democractic Party [DP], expressed concern over the current 
South-North relations and the will to meet the great leader by 
personally visiting Pyongyang to improve South-North relations, 
which are at a stalemate. 
  I recognize that Executive Chairman Yi Ki-taek's will to 
visit Pyongyang is motivated by his ardent patriotic sentiment, 
which is naturally possessed by people who worry over the fate 
of the country and nation. I express support for and welcome it. 
  Our Republic's Government has for a long time transcended 
differences in ideology, ideas, and systems to promote great 
national unity. With the desire of reunifying the fatherland, 
our Republic's Government put forth bilateral and multilateral 
negotiations of responsible politicians of the North and South 
and, thus, exerted sincere efforts to realize it. 
  I believe that now is the time when responsible politicians 
of the North and South must gather together to dissolve the 
acute confrontational relations within the nation and jointly 
seek ways to open a new phase in the country's peace and 
peaceful reunification. 
  If South Korea's DP Executive Chairman Yi Ki-taek visits 
Pyongyang with this purpose, we will welcome him with all our 
hearts and will open-mindedly discuss with him the nation's 
matter of grave concern. I express the hope that Executive 
Chairman Yi Ki-taek will visit Pyongyang as his first trip this 
year for national reconciliation, unity, and the country's 
reunification in line with the desire of the whole nation.

against the North in the skies above Kunwi, Koesan, Yoju, 
Uijongbu, Yongwol, Pyongchang, Yechon, Kapyong and Chunchon, 
South Korea, Wednesday and Thursday [12, 13 January] with the 
mobilization of overseas-based fighter-bombers, pursuit assault 
planes and observation planes such as F-16s, A-10s and FA-18s as 
well as warplanes belonging to the U.S. Seventh Air Force, 
according to military sources. 
  A total of 350 warplanes were involved in the exercises. 
  In another development, ground units of the puppet army held 
a ground attack exercise for a surprise breakthrough on the 
military demarcation line in Cholwon County, South Korean 
Kangwon Province, Thursday with the support of fighters and 
helicopter gunboats. 
  A group of puppet army tanks deployed in Paju County 
advanced 
up to the bank of the Imjin River together with infantry units, 
firing scores of shells. 
  Large-calibre artillery units and armed bandits of the 
puppet 
army went off into war hysterics, firing shells and bullets in 
Yonchon, Paju and Cholwon counties. 
  The war exercises of the U.S. imperialists and the South 
Korean puppets were premeditated provocations to deliberately 
aggravate the tensions on the Korean peninsula.

<F P=106> [Statement by the spokesman for the Committee for the </F>
Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland in Pyongyang, 17 
January--read by announcer] 
  [Text] A Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the 
Fatherland [CPRF] spokesman has issued a statement in connection 
with the bellicose, absurd remarks made by the South Korean 
puppets as soon as the New Year began in order to aggravate 
tensions while seeking a large-scale war rehearsal. 
  A statement of the CPRF spokesman: 
  With the start of the new year, the South Korean puppets are 
making bellicose, absurd remarks aimed at further expanding 
provocative war rehearsals and thus aggravating tensions this 
year. According to a report, South Korea's so-called hardliners 
toward the North and military warmongers said that even if the 
Team Spirit joint military exercise were to be suspended this 
year, they would expand another kind of South Korea-U.S. joint 
military exercise to fill the gap created. In the SEOUL SINMUN, 
a paper produced and patronized by the government, they said 
that they would conduct a large-scale war rehearsal combining 
the two military exercises, Ulchi and Focus Lens, in August in 
case the Team Spirit exercise should be suspended. 
  Prior to this, the South Korean ruler and military leaders, 
in a so-called New Year news conference and New Year opening 
ceremony, picked on us again and made bellicose, absurd remarks 
without hesitation, referring to complete combat readiness and 
establishment of an emergency combat posture. While all fellow 
countrymen are resolved with high aspirations to make the year 
of 1994 a year of achieving national reconciliation and unity 
and bringing a turning point for peace and peaceful 
reunification, the South Korean authorities are agitating 
confrontation and war in their attempt to conduct a new 
large-scale war rehearsal in place of the Team Spirit joint 
military exercise. This shows that they intend to seek 
confrontation and war rather than national reconciliation and 
unity again this year. 
  The CPRF sternly denounces the South Korean puppet clique's 
war frenzy of seeking a large-scale war rehearsal against us in 
order to aggravate the North-South relations and lead the 
situation on the Korean peninsula to a grave catastrophe, with 
the start of the new year, and brands it an open challenge to 
the entire nation that desires alleviation of tension, peace, 
and peaceful reunification. 
  As has been known, as a measure to resolve the nuclear issue 
on the Korean peninsula, the issue of suspending the Team Spirit 
joint military exercise in South Korea is on the order of the 
day. At a time like this, the South Korean authorities are 
scheming to conduct another kind of large-scale joint military 
exercise to replace the Team Spirit joint military exercise, 
thus attempting to put a brake on the progress of the DPRK-U.S. 
talks and to lay a new grave obstacle to resolving the nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  Even if the Team Spirit joint military exercise is suspended 
in South Korea, if another joint military exercise is conducted, 
the suspension of the Team Spirit nuclear war rehearsal will in 
fact become meaningless. If things turn out this way 
[ironsiguro nagandamyon], the nuclear issue cannot be resolved 
on the Korean peninsula, nor can the alleviation of tensions or 
peace be realized, and a more dangerous war situation will 
prevail instead. The South Korean ruling bunch should never 
miscalculate [opan] our demand to suspend the provocative 
large-scale war rehearsal. 
  We are not only prepared for dialogue but are well prepared 
for war as well. No matter how precious peace may be, we will 
never beg for it. We will resolutely counter [taecho] reckless 
acts of provokers. 
  Confrontation, war, and civilian democracy [munmin] are 
incompatible. If the South Korean authorities that claim 
themselves to be advocates of civilian democracy, continue to 
follow the road of confrontation and war in collusion with 
foreign forces, ignoring fellow countrymen who desire 
reconciliation, unity, detente, and peace, they will certainly 
pay a dear price for the nation. 
  [Dated] 17 January 1994, Pyongyang.

<F P=106> ["War Hysterics From Beginning of the Year" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 18 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam 
puppet clique declared that they would stage in summer an 
integrated drill of the "Ulchi" and "Focus Lens" exercises which 
had been held as annual functions in league with outside forces. 
  Branding this as a premeditated and deliberate move to push 
the North-South relations to a more acute phase of confrontation 
and war from the beginning of the year, a MINJU CHOSON news 
analyst says: 
  It goes without saying that the suspension of the "Team 
Spirit" joint military exercises will lose its meaning in case a 
greater war game than the "Team Spirit" is staged. If things go 
like this, the "nuclear problem" will remain unsolved on the 
Korean peninsula indefinitely, to say nothing of detente and 
peace. 
  By more desperately resorting to war moves, the Kim Yong-sam 
group reveals once again that it is a group of warlikers and 
traitors outdistancing the preceding military dictators. 
  Politics is in confusion in South Korea. Through several 
working contacts between the DPRK and the United States, the 
third round of talks was put on the order of the day and it was 
agreed to settle the issues in a package deal as proposed by the 
DPRK. 
  Driven to a miserable position under such situation, the 
traitor Kim Yong-sam is getting hysteric in North-South 
confrontation and staging feverish war games from the beginning 
of the year and is scheming to stage a war game surpassing the 
"Team Spirit" joint military exercises in summer. This is 
intended to threaten the DPRK and put a spoke in the wheel of 
the DPRK-USA talks, the key to the solution of the nuclear 
problem and peace on the Korean peninsula. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique must look straight at the 
reality and act with discretion.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 17 (KCNA) -- The Korean computer 
centre, which stands on a bank of the Taedong River in 
Pyongyang, is a promising export centre of computer software. 
  In the past three years since its inauguration, the centre 
has developed many softwares for the computerization of 
production processes and control of machine devices including 
lathes by various computers, an aggregation of advanced 
technology. 
  Last year, the researchers of the centre developed Pyongyang 
word processing programme "Sogwang", a production process 
automation system, an office automation programme, a pattern 
designing software, an architectural designing system, an expert 
system and other softwares. 
  These softwares are available for personal computers, the 
most popularized one in the world. 
  Many systems and programmes have proven effective in the 
computerization of factories and enterprises in different 
domains of the national economy and some of them are exported. 
The softwares developed by the centre are in great demand 
externally. The educational Taegwon-to programme enjoyed high 
popularity among the participants in the first World Junior 
Taegwon-to Championship held in Moscow last year. 
  The employees of the centre are developing programmes of 
wide 
variety to meet the growing external demand, while receiving 
orders from foreign countries.

<F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 14 January editorial: "Let Us Vigorously </F>
Advance, Upholding the Banner of Self-reliance"] 
  [Text] The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, in his New 
Year's address, set forth a militant slogan, "Let us vigorously 
accelerate the general onward march of socialism with the 
revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle," and 
called on the entire party and all the people to continue on for 
the great victory. 
  The revolutionary slogan reflects the intent of the party 
and 
the leader [suryong] who wish to make 1994 a year of historic 
upturn in our country's revolution and construction by lifting a 
strong wind of self-reliance in the entire country. Today, the 
revolutionary slogan of self-reliance and hard struggle grabs 
the hearts of our people and encourages them to march toward a 
new feat. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has noted: The 
prevailing situation demands us more than ever before to highly 
display the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard 
struggle. Our people's history of socialist construction is the 
history of self-reliance. Because our people have a strong 
revolutionary spirit of rising from the ruins with their own 
strength, believing in only the party and the leader [suryong], 
they were able to effect the great Chollima upsurge in the 
difficult postwar days and firmly adhere to the socialist cause 
by smashing all sorts of the imperialists' obstructionist 
maneuvers. Self-reliance is the only road to existence and to 
displaying the dignity of the nation; this is the truth that our 
people have learned by paying a dear price. 
  All party members and working people should now advance by 
upholding the militant slogan of self-reliance. This is an 
important requirement for thoroughly implementing the party's 
revolutionary economic strategy and brilliantly carrying out the 
tasks of the adjustment period for socialist economic 
construction. 
  Our party's revolutionary economic strategy is the wisest 
formula of economic construction aimed at satisfactorily 
guaranteeing the people's living condition in conformity with 
socialist requirements and dislodging a new position of attack 
to occupy a higher land of socialism. This economic strategy 
calls for displaying limitless economic potentials. It is our 
party's strategic plan, out of the principle of self-reliance, 
to rapidly develop light industry, agriculture, and foreign 
trade with our own strength, technology, and resources so as to 
highly enhance the people's living condition in the near future. 
  This year is a first year of the adjustment period. The 
success of this year's struggle depends on how all the people 
will display the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard 
struggle. When everyone fights with the same strong spirit of 
self-reliance that once filled the thick forest of Mt. Paektu 
and the same spirit of hard struggle with which we shoveled for 
the first time after the war, the flame of great revolutionary 
upsurge will be kindled again in every domain of the socialist 
construction. 
  Everyone displaying the spirit of self-reliance and hard 
struggle comes as a decisive factor in consolidating the might 
of self-dependent economy and smashing the imperialists' 
maneuvers of isolation and obliteration. 
  The might of the people who fight with a firm conviction in 
their own strength is infinite and no enemy can match the power 
of such masses. The achievements of last year's struggle that 
brilliantly adorned the final year of the Third Seven-Year Plan 
in a sharp political, military confrontation with the 
imperialists prove this eloquently. 
  Today's prevailing situation in which the imperialists beef 
up suppression and blockade as never before and a great change 
takes place in the country's external economic relations demands 
that we further strengthen a self-dependent economy in any 
condition. In order to do so, the principle of self-reliance 
should be firmly adhered to. No one can touch us when the 
foundation of a self- dependent economy is firm. The slogan of 
self-reliance is the most reasonable slogan that totally 
corresponds to the basic interest of our revolution and 
construction and is a revolutionary slogan that turns misfortune 
into fortune. 
  All party members and working people should bring about a 
constant innovation and continue to advance, upholding the 
party's slogan, "Let us accelerate the general onward march of 
socialism with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and 
hard struggle." 
  Above all, we, with a firm conviction in our strength, 
should 
keep in our hearts the chuche-oriented point of view and 
position that we will only live in our own way. The 
chuche-oriented point of view and conviction are ideological and 
spiritual foundations of self-reliance. A strong mettle that 
anything can be accomplished with one's own strength in whatever 
circumstances and an inexhaustible creative power that creates 
something out of nothing all stem from the chuche-oriented 
conviction. 
  All party members and working people should vigorously 
advance with the firm confidence in the great leadership of our 
party which leads our socialist cause into the single road of 
invincibility; the might of our revolutionary ranks which is 
being single-heartedly united by the masses, the party, and the 
leader [suryong]; and the might of our self-independent economy 
which does not vacillate in whatever storm. 
  When the party members and working people keep in their 
hearts the strong conviction in victory that we will surely win 
as long as the dear comrade leader leads our socialist cause, 
the revolutionary ethos of self-reliance and hard struggle will 
be even more displayed in any place. 
  For those who have the firm chuche-oriented point of view 
and 
position, there will be no incident of looking at others and 
relying on others' strength. We believe in our own strength and 
should vigorously press ahead with production and construction 
with our own technology, materials, and natural resources. 
  Our party members and working people, when manufacturing a 
single part of a machine or a single necessary item of life, 
should make them of good quality and strive to develop science 
technology that matches the current situation of our country. 
In order to demonstrate the revolutionary spirit of 
self-reliance and hard struggle, it is important for our party 
members and working people to have a strong will and mettle to 
implement revolutionary tasks presented by the party without 
fail. 
  At a time when a grand march to adorn this year as a year of 
revolutionary upturn is being waged, what we need is the spirit 
of absoluteness and unconditionality of patriotic forefathers of 
the anti-Japanese revolution who strived with the conviction 
that they have no right to die unless there is an order from the 
comrade supreme commander and the indefatigable revolutionary 
spirit of heroic fighters of the Fatherland Liberation War who 
defended a height of the nation, sacrificing their lives. 
  All party members and working people should surely carry out 
their revolutionary tasks presented by the party with their 
strength, wisdom, and devoted struggle, upholding the party's 
slogan, "When the party decides, we will act." 
  In all domains of the national economy, this year's national 
economic plan should be unconditionally fulfilled by the day, by 
the month, by the quarter, and by the indicators by mobilizing 
all possible efforts, resources, and equipment. In particular, 
major domains of the national economy, such as the light 
industry, agriculture, foreign trade, the coal industry, the 
power industry, transport by railway, and the metal industry, 
should boldly carry out a struggle to fulfill the party's 
revolutionary economic strategy by highly displaying the 
revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle. 
  In all sectors and units, the production and conservation 
struggle should be waged to mobilize internal reserves to the 
maximum. This is an important requirement for thoroughly 
embodying the principle of self-reliance in the economic 
construction. 
  Our country's socialist self-independent economy has a great 
production potential. The question lies in searching all sorts 
of internal reserves by buckling down with firm resolve. Just 
as work to mobilize internal reserves were vigorously waged in 
every place to create the speedy advance of Chollima by 
upholding the decision made at the plenary session in December, 
1956, the entire party and all the people should turn out in the 
effort to strengthen the production and conservation struggle. 
  All domains and units should satisfactorily carry out 
maintenance and supplementary work for production facilities, 
management of facilities and manpower, and the work of supplying 
materials so that all facilities are fully operated and 
production is normalized at a high level. 
  Today's circumstances demand that all domains carry out the 
nation's housekeeping in a frugal manner and more highly raise 
the beacon of struggle for conservation. 
  All party members and working people should unanimously rise 
in the work for conservation of fuel, energy, raw materials and 
other materials, including electricity and coal. 
  Those who save even a watt of electricity, a handful of 
coal, 
and a piece of grain can be called genuine patriots who live and 
struggle with the spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle. 
  For the guiding functionaries to thoroughly embody the 
revolutionary slogan of self-reliance and arduous struggle in 
all fields of socialist construction, they should properly carry 
out the combat organizational work with staunch revolutionary 
spirit. 
  The position on which the commanding members should stand in 
this year's tense struggle is in the vanguard of the ranks. All 
guiding functionaries should boldly break through all 
difficulties they face with their own strength with ardent 
passion and revolutionary determination to carry to 
accomplishment without fail the party's revolutionary economic 
strategy. They should inspire production masses to the struggle 
to actively mobilize internal reserves and to increase 
production. 
  The functionaries with a strong revolutionary spirit of 
self-reliance are the people who, without exception, make 
tenacious efforts to constantly revolutionize and classicize 
themselves. 
  Rejecting stagnation and stalemate, the guiding 
functionaries 
should always live with the spirit of crossing the blazing river 
and bog. They should deeply mingle with the masses, sharing the 
same food with them, and should learn from them our people's 
excellent trait of struggling for self-reliance. 
  It is important in making the whole nation overflow with the 
revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and the arduous struggle 
to enhance the political functions and role of party 
organizations at each level. 
  Party organizations should strengthen organizational and 
political work so that all party members and working people 
unanimously rise in the struggle to strengthen the 
self-supporting nature and might of our economy by upholding the 
great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year's address and 
decisions of the 21st plenary session of the Sixth Party Central 
Committee. 
  Party organizations should make all working people keenly 
realize that self-reliance is the only way for survival and is 
the road to victory, through brilliant realities in our country 
and the situation in the countries where socialism was 
frustrated. 
  The revolutionary spirit of self-reliance displayed during 
the postwar period of the great Chollima upsurge is a driving 
force which will vigorously push ahead with our revolution and 
construction today and in the future. 
  Party organizations should actively lead all party members 
and working people so that they live and struggle with the 
spirit cherished during the difficult postwar period when they 
produced more steel material and even manufactured trucks and 
tractors. 
  Assuming our party's revolutionary slogan of self-reliance 
and arduous struggle as the guideline and principle in their 
struggle and life, all people should more vigorously fight to 
glorify history of socialist construction in our country forever 
as the proud history of self-reliance.

<F P=106> [Article by Nate Thayer: "Govt, KR Jockey for Political </F>
Power; Battlefield Strategies Tied to Peace Talks' Goals"] 
  [Exerpts] Siem Reap -- Cambodian government forces are 
trying to launch a major military offensive against the Khmer 
Rouge (KR) to bolster their leverage during peace negotiations 
to include the guerrilla faction in the government. [passage 
omitted] 
  But the government has been forced to postpone a major push 
against KR strongholds at Pailin and Anlung Veng because of a 
lack of ammunition and difficulties in adequately preparing 
field operations. 
  KR, government and diplomatic sources agree that the 
government hopes to concentrate initially on a major assault on 
Anlung Veng, the northern headquarters of the guerrilla faction 
under the command of Gen. Ta Mok. 
  The assault on Pailin has been put on hold for fears they 
would not be able to successfully capture the KR stronghold 
without more ammunition. 
  "There is no panic. They are going on with their plans for 
the offensive as normal," said a western military source. "They 
are waiting for the ammunition and when they get it they will 
attack Anlung Veng. For Pailin, they decided to cancel their 
plans for the moment, they don't speak about Pailin anymore." 
  Both sides acknowledge the imminent fighting is a test of 
strength that is designed to influence the leverage each seeks 
during peace talks over how to include the KR in the government 
and the army. [passage omitted] 
  But both sides see the military push -- expected to begin 
this month -- as designed to gain political advantage and 
neither side contends that the offensive, no matter how 
successful, could wipe out the KR as a military force. 
  What is clear is that peace has been postponed for at least 
another dry season in Cambodia and war is seen as inevitable, by 
both sides, to achieve their longer term political objectives. 
  For the KR, this means a desire for a maximum power sharing 
role in the new government and the army. For the government the 
objective is to weaken the guerrilla faction to be in a position 
to give up less at the negotiating table. 
  "No negotiation is successful at the negotiating table 
alone," one KR official said. "What we get depends on the 
fighting. Of course we want the maximum but it depends if we 
can defend ourselves." 
  KR sources acknowledge they may be able to hold Pailin or 
Anlung Veng in the face of a well organized and equipped 
government attack. 
  "They will fight, we will defend the territory but not at 
any 
cost. We may lose some areas during the dry season but we will 
take it back in the rainy season. At the end we will come out 
on top. If they want to try, let them try," he said. [passage 
omitted] 
  Senior government and diplomatic sources say government 
officials have officially requested military aid from China, 
Russia, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos and North 
Korea but have come up mostly empty handed. 
  Russia is said to have given ten million rounds of AK-47 
ammunition and small token contributions from Malaysia and 
Singapore may have been acquired. China may also provide some 
equipment. 
  "We want to start now on Anlung Veng but we are waiting for 
ammunition. We don't have enough, we hope we will have ammo in 
a few short days," said Gen. Toan Chhay in an interview on Jan. 
7. 
  He is the governor of Siem Reap province and military 
commander of the 4th Military Region which is in charge of the 
key provinces of Kompong Thom, Preah Vihear, Siem Reap and parts 
of Oddar Meanchey. 
  It is here that KR commander Ta Mok, in control of 12 
Divisions, has his headquarters. He is said to control at least 
3,000 regular troops, plus militia and until recently was based 
at Anlung Veng. 
  Government forces claim to have 16,000 men under arms in 
Military Region four. 
  Gen. Toan Chhay outlined the strategy of the two sides in 
the 
coming weeks: "As a whole, the KR know we are about to launch 
the operation against Anlung Veng for our self-defense. In the 
meantime they want to occupy and capture the district at Choam 
Khsan in Preah Vihear to set up a bridge from a new headquarters 
near the tri-border area. 
  "Once they capture Choam Khsan, they will launch to capture 
the whole of Preah Vihear... We want to attack Anlung Veng so 
that they will withdraw their troops, to draw them away from 
Siem Reap, Preah Vihear, Oddar Meanchey and Kompong Thom to 
defend Anlung Veng. If we leave Anlung Veng intact they will 
send their front-line further," he said. 
  In Battambang province, the other major military theater, 
commanders spoke of similar problems. 
  At the government Division 12 headquarters located along 
Route 5 near the Thai border, troops engaged in heavy clashes 
after attacking KR positions along Phnum Malai, north of Pailin. 
More than 100 people were killed or wounded in the first five 
days of the month, according to commanders. 
  "We do not have enough ammunition. They said, maybe we will 
get more this week," said Gen. Em Saray, deputy commander of the 
12th Division. 
  "Our objective is to destroy the 450 Division but it depends 
on the weapons supply. Plans for the attack on Pailin are not 
clear yet. The general staff in Phnom Penh has not given us a 
clear decision yet." 
  The first week of January also saw significant fighting in 
the area between Samraong and the Thai border in northern Oddar 
Meanchey province. 
  KR forces captured the former FUNCINPEC [National United 
Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative 
Cambodia] military base at Koam Chong and burned at least nine 
villages long under FUNCINPEC influence. Government forces 
recaptured the base but the "situation is not calm and remains 
unclear," said Gen Toan Chay. 
  However, both government and KR sources say the fighting in 
this area reflects ongoing local anger over the government 
attack and capture of the KR base at Phnum Chhat last August. 
It is not part of the current, centrally coordinated government 
offensive. 
  "It was a big mistake of the government to attack Phnum 
Chhat," said a senior government military official who asked to 
remain anonymous. "It made the local people very angry, not just 
the KR but the villagers." 
  Phnum Chhat was the headquarters for KR Division 519 and 
served as a civilian base for diplomatic and other personnel and 
their families. 
  Perhaps the most important battle theater may be in Preah 
Vihear province, which both government and KR sources say will 
be a focus of fighting. 
  Ta Mok has established a new headquarters north of the 
border 
district of Choam Khsan, after abandoning Anlung Veng in 
preparation of the expected government assault. 
  In an interview on Jan. 7, Preah Vihear governor and 
military commander Gen. Mean Sarin said his province was under 
daily attack by the KR. He said 500-600 KR have surrounded 
Choam Khsan, cut all roads and are "attacking us every day." 
  He said the morale of the KR troops was strong and they were 
well armed. KR reinforcements had been brought from Kompong 
Cham, Kompong Thom and Preah Vihear to participate in the 
assault. 
  "The KR really want to fight because they believe in their 
leaders. They are not new, but the old cadre," said Gen. Mean 
Sarin. 
  He said 300 KR had defected in his area but they were mainly 
recruits from the 1980s. 
  "The defections reflect their desire for peace. The old 
cadre are waiting for orders. Those that have been with the KR 
since 1970 are sticking to the position that the winner of the 
election should take control of the government according to 
international standards," said the general. 
  "They say that the KR should get 20 percent of the army, 
FUNCINPEC 20 percent, CPP [Cambodian People's Party] 20 percent 
and the KP [Khmer People's National Liberation Front] 20 percent 
while 20 percent should be divided among civilian administration 
and state bureaucracy," he added. 
  Preah Vihear is effectively cut off from government access 
by 
land, and 300 government soldiers are currently trying to open 
up Route 12 from Kompong Thom to Choam Khsan. 
  Equipped with bulldozers, a single mine detector and earth 
moving equipment, the troops are clearing 36 kilometers of 
heavily mined road that military commanders say must be opened 
within a month to save Preah Vihear from KR capture. 
  Gen. Toan Chay said: "We are trying to repair Route 12, 
otherwise we cannot save Preah Vihear. Our main objective is to 
defend Choam Khsan and Preah Vihear, not to capture Anlung Veng." 
  Gen. Mean Sarin said he has 1,970 soldiers in Preah Vihear 
but currently they are lacking food, ammunition, medical 
supplies and other necessities. 
  Government officials say the morale of KR troops remains 
high 
in the north. 
  Gen. Toan Chay said: "Morale of their troops is still very 
good. They are united to defend themselves. If they are not 
united they will die together. In the field they are willing to 
achieve the orders from their commanders." 
  "The KR are very confident," he said. "They are launching a 
political campaign designed to hang the government by the throat 
economically. They count only on their forces and finally no 
one loses, no ones wins. The suffering falls on the whole 
country." 
  "For us to lose is very easy, to win very difficult and to 
maintain victory, even more difficult," said the general. 
  While both sides agree the outcome of the fighting will be 
crucial to what is finally decided at the political negotiating 
table, it is not likely to deal a mortal blow to the KR 
militarily. 
  The KR are prepared to give up fixed bases and have made 
contingencies to revert to guerrilla tactics if they lose their 
main rear sanctuaries. 
  But more importantly, many analysts say the KR threat 
remains 
primarily a political one. Military assaults can only disperse 
them into large tracts of jungles and remote villages that are 
virtually impossible for the government to bring under central 
control by force. 
  "Our military attacks are important as a demonstration of 
strength," said Gen. Toan Chay. "But it is not as important as 
economic development. We can spend millions of dollars on tanks 
and artillery to kill ten KR. Why?" 
  More alarming to many officials in the government controlled 
provinces and other observers, is the deteriorating security 
because of crime, widespread corruption by military and local 
officials, and the difficulty in implementing rural economic 
development to improve the lives of the peasantry. 
  They say the people had unrealistic expectations for change 
after the UN operation in Cambodia and the government conduct so 
far has done little to engender faith that things will improve 
soon. 
  It is the KR who will reap the political benefit of 
continuing popular frustration, they say. 
  A KR official said: "Politically and in terms of morale, 
they 
(the government) have no forces in the country side." 
  "If we didn't have popular strength, they wouldn't even give 
us the time of day. But if we are weak militarily, we will 
never get anything at the negotiating table. But this is not 
about the military it is about politics. 
  Despite KR confidence that they can withstand a government 
assault, people everywhere are afraid of what the faction really 
wants and hatred runs deep for the killings and suffering during 
the KR years in power.

  [Text] Report on the attack to destroy an offensive of the 
communist Vietnamese's lackey puppets on Route 68 Battlefield: 
  1. The puppets of the communist Vietnamese have mustered a 
number of their lieutenant generals, major generals, and 
brigadier generals to launch new offensives along Route 68. 
Moreover, they also called up the previously defeated troops 
from Kompong Thom Province as reinforcements, and General Prum 
Samen was personally sent from the Phnom Penh headquarters to 
command troops on the battlefield. 
  2. During the two-day battle from 15 to 16 January, the 
National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] attacked them with 
gunfire and land mines, destroying five army vehicles and two 
tanks. The NADK also killed over 20 enemy soldiers and 
seriously wounded more than 30 others, including Prum Samen, an 
envoy of the Phnom Penh headquarters who had previously been 
posted to Stoung Battlefield in Kompong Thom Province. 
  The enemy commanders and their rank and file were in panic 
but the Phnom Penh headquarters was then not able to find a 
replacement for Prum Samen. Finally, it ordered [Gen.] Long 
Sopheap of Siem Reap Province's Military Region 4 to replace the 
wounded general. Long Sopheap, however, said he did not yet want 
to go and that he needed to wait and look at the situation for a 
little while. 
  3. Afraid of being killed, the commanders of the ranks of 
captain, major, and colonel have fled the battlefield one after 
another. Hundreds of soldiers who had been forcibly recruited 
in various villages as well as troops in diverse units have also 
deserted in force.

<F P=106> [Message from PDK president Khieu Samphan to FUNCINPEC </F>
chairman Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh in reply to the 
latter's 8 January message issued on 15 January; place not given 
-- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Most humbly to Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, 
chairman of the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an 
Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] party, 
Phnom Penh: 
  Highness, I would like to express sincere thanks to you for 
graciously sending me a cable dated 8 January. In the spirit of 
promoting a prompt process, I ask your permission to inform you 
of the following: 
  1. In the message dated 8 January 1994, you wrote that you 
support the five-point initative of his majesty the king and 
that all five points should be simultaneously implemented. 
However, the other side has not yet accepted his majesty the 
king's five-point guideline. 
  A. The Phnom Penh faction continues to demand that the party 
of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] fulfill its three preconditions 
first, which are cease-fire, surrender of the liberated zones, 
and dissolution of the army. Moreover, they have demanded that 
the PDK be integrated into their military and civilian 
structures which, basically, are the communist Vietnamese 
structures set up since 1979. 
  B. Their so-called need for constitutional amendments is 
merely a deception, and it means that they have already imposed 
a condition on the negotiations. 
  C. On the battlefields themselves, they have launched 
large-scale offensives in an attempt to crush the forces of 
Democratic Kampuchea [DK] and block genuine national 
reconciliation and they have talked about nothing but fight, 
fight, and fight. 
  Such actions cannot promote genuine national reconciliation 
because they are not a genuine rallying of national forces but 
an attempt to force the PDK into the cage that the communist 
Vietnamese have prepared since they first invaded Cambodia and 
to make the PDK commit suicide. 
  I would like to take this opportunity to inform your 
highness 
that the PDK is supporting the five-point guideline of high 
majesty the king not to get this or that position for its own 
benefit within the government or in this or that ministry. The 
truth is that the serious situation facing our nation and people 
at the present calls for all national forces, including DK, to 
take part in solving it by playing a role in the government and 
in an army that truly belongs to the nation known as the Khmer 
Royal Armed Forces. 
  The five-point initiative of his majesty the king stems from 
his wisdom, sagacity, and years of political experience, and he 
clearly understands that the situation requires that there be a 
solution not just by giving this or that position to this or 
that personality without according him any possibilities or 
rights to contribute to solving the nation and people's serious 
problems. 
  2. Concerning the technical group, I would like to propose 
that under the current circumstances it is desirable to allow 
the technical group to function as soon as possible without 
giving it any name, just as your highness graciously proposed to 
me on 17 December 1993, and with the participation of a 
representative of the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party. This 
is not just for form's sake. It also bears a political 
significance. If the technical group functions according to any 
formulas other than that described on 17 December 1993, even if 
it uses his majesty the king's five-point initiative as the 
basis for discussions, the spirit and the wishes of his majesty 
the king would not be fulfilled. Only by proceeding in the 
manner agreed upon between your highnness and I on 17 December 
1993 can we meet and discuss ways to bring about early and 
lasting peace. 
  3. I sincerely inform your highness of the above because the 
desire and wishes of the PDK and myself are to see your highness 
and the FUNCINPEC party, along with other national resistance 
forces, enjoy full capacity and right to perform the work in 
accordance with your patriotic ideal. The overwhelming majority 
of our nation and people who gave their votes to your highness 
and the FUNCINPEC party also have these same desire and wishes. 
  Very humbly yours. 
  [Dated] 15 January 1994 
  [Signed] Khieu Samphan, president of the PDK

<F P=106> ["Communique" by the spokesman of the National Army of </F>
Democratic Kampuchea; dated 12 January; place not given -- read 
by announcer] 
  [Excertps] I. Of late, the Vietnamese puppets within the 
two-headed government have again employed an obsolete, 
despicable maneuver by misleadingly proclaiming that the 
National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] has used Thai 
territory. 
  II. The NADK spokesman has already rejected this kind of 
unsubstantiated accusation with unscrupulous political motives 
many times. 
  III. It is asked why the two-headed government painstakingly 
proclaimed and systematically hurled this accusation at other 
people? 
  A. The government made this tumultuous accusation to conceal 
its shameful defeat in the so-called large-scale offensive 
against Phnum Malai from 1 to 3 January. During the offensive, 
they employed all-out efforts; they even infiltrated Thai 
territory in the Nang Ean area for the purpose of attacking the 
people and the NADK from behind. They made this clamorous and 
false statement with the aim of camouflaging its own intrusion 
into Thai territory. This is the communist Vietnamese's 
obsolete trick of a thief shouting 'stop thief.' 
  B. They made this false statement to conceal activities 
conducted by the warmongering communist Vietnamese and its 
alliance -- they were hurriedly drawing up a plan and shipping 
invading forces, ammunition, tanks, and cannons in an attempt to 
attack the people and the DK [Democratic Kampuchea] resistance 
forces in western and northern Cambodia for the purpose of 
hindering national reconciliation. 
  C. Their blatant statement is aimed at pressuring Thailand 
and the Royal Thai Government into giving up their support for 
national reconciliation and peace in Cambodia. [passage omitted]

  [Text] On 14 January His Excellency [H.E.] Khieu Samphan, 
chairman of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK], sent a 
telegram to His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk, king of Cambodia, 
expressing respect and admiration for the latter's 5 January 
1994 editorial entitled "Human Rights in Cambodia and the Rights 
of the Cambodian People To Live Permanently in Peace Within 
Cambodia's Internationally Recognized Legitimate Land and Sea 
Borders of 1963-69." The telegram reads as follows: 
  Humbly to His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, king of 
Cambodia. 
  His Majesty has composed an editorial dated 5 January 1994 
entitled "Human Rights in Cambodia and the Rights of the 
Cambodian People To Live Permanently in Peace Within Cambodia's 
Internationally Recognized Legitimate Land and Sea Borders of 
1963-69." 
  We would like to express our great respect and admiration 
for 
the resourcefulness of His Majesty, who is always concerned 
about national and social problems facing our Cambodian nation 
and people. Our people are delighted to praise you for this 
prowess. 
  The editorial is encouraging our people to join hands to 
resolve currently unresolved problems, both big and small, and 
to follow you in your crusade, like the one you launched between 
1952 and 1953. Our nation and people pin their hopes on His 
Majesty, the only great leader capable of leading the country 
and preventing our Cambodian nation and people from disappearing 
as was the case in Kampuchea Kraom. Our nation and people are 
well aware of the great dangers since several western powers and 
UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia] implemented a 
policy of opening up Cambodia for millions of ethnic Vietnamese 
to enter freely and systematically. 
  For our compatriots -- the children of His Majesty, who is 
the father of the nation and the father of national independence 
-- the editorial is vitally important. For this reason, I have 
ordered the Voice of the Great National Union Front of Cambodia 
[VGNUFC] radio to broadcast the article several times for the 
attention of our nation and people. 
  Availing myself of this opportunity, I would like to wish 
His 
Majesty a speedy recovery, zealous physical strength, and high 
spirits. I would like to extend best wishes to the respected 
queen as well. 
  Your Majesty, please forgive any inappropriateness. 
  [Dated] 14 January 1994

burned people's rice fields. 
  2. The NADK spokesman totally rejects this accusation by the 
ancillary spokesman of the two-heads-three-eyes government. 
  3. The NADK spokesman wishes to clarify that the NADK is the 
defender of the nation, people, and peasants. It is also the 
peasants' helper and liberator opposing aggressors who oppress 
them. This is the NADK's longstanding tradition which cannot be 
distorted. 
  On the contrary, it is only the communist Vietnamese 
aggressors and the communist Vietnamese puppets as well as their 
foreign cronies who have exploited the nation and people. They 
are pocketing foreigners' money and colluding with them to 
oppress and destroy the nation, people, and peasants. This is 
why they have no support from the peasants' force. 
  As for NADK and Democratic Kampuchea [DK], they have 
support. 
This is because the DK and NADK are defenders of the nation and 
people and liberators of the peasants.

  [Excerpts] While meeting with reporters on the morning of 
15 January at the opening of a vocational training course on 
journalism organized by UNESCO, Ek Sereivoat, state secretary in 
the National Defense Ministry, said that the Khmer Rouge issue 
will certainly be resolved within a year at most. [passage

  On the same occasion, he answered questions from local 
reporters on the influx of Vietnamese immigrants and the anarchy 
among some of the armed forces. He said that the Royal 
Government is focusing on and paying attention to problems at a 
number of border passes, particularly passes along waterways, 
where ministers and deputy ministers in the Ministry of National 
Defense are vigorously striving to solve problems. So far, 
hundreds of Vietnamese boats have been prevented from continuing 
their journey into Cambodia. Concerning the anarchy among the 
armed forces, he stressed that an appropriate army structure 
will be set up very soon. As for other aspects of the anarchy, 
such as unauthorized checkpoints, the Royal Government has 
firmly assigned tasks to commanders of operational zones and 
police chiefs in cities and provinces, who must absolutely 
eliminate this problem.

  [Text] Jakarta, Jan 17 (OANA-ANTARA) -- President Suharto 
here on Monday called on regional journalists to rectify the 
imbalance in world news which mostly disadvantages developing 
countries. 
  "We are nowadays often flooded with news which, on the one 
hand, are beneficial to the interest of advanced countries 
while, on the other hand, destroy the image of developing 
countries," he said, opening the 18th general assembly of the 
Confederation of ASEAN Journalists and International Press 
convention. 
  Suharto stated the striking disparities, inequalities, and 
injustices in the relations between the developed and developing 
countries did not occur only in the economic sphere but also in 
other fields, including the press. 
  "It is incumbent upon us to spare the responsibilities of 
changing these inequalities and injustices," he said. 
  Touching on human rights issues that draws international 
attention lately, Suharto said that the improvement on and 
protection of the human rights should be seen as a whole and not 
separately. 
  He reiterated that the implementation of human rights was 
dependent and colored by the different economic, social, and 
cultural conditions of individual countries, saying that human 
rights is the right of every nation to have its own national 
characteristics and culture, as well as the right to determine 
its own social and political systems. 
  There should not be an excessive evaluation or emphasis on 
one right over others, he said. 
  "As a nation that was colonized for 350 years, the 
Indonesian 
nation fully understands the meaning and essence of human 
rights," he added. 
  Suharto also said the press should also bear in mind that 
there were regional and national differences on the 
understanding, institutionalizing, and implementation of human 
rights. 
  "The differences in the level of progress and living 
standard 
brought a meaningful impact on the practice of human rights. 
Hopefully these issues also draw the attention of the press," he 
added. 
  President Suharto warmly welcomed the conference's choice of 
theme of North-South and South-South dialogues, saying that in 
the current globalized world, solution to the world's problems 
should be sought and implemented jointly by both developed and 
developing countries. 
  "Therefore, only through constructive dialogue between North 
and South countries based on partnership, mutual interest, 
shared benefit, and responsibility, can the world free itself 
from the present apprehensive situation," he said. 
  He also expressed the hope that a sound, free, and 
responsible press would assist the press and other media in the 
region in encouraging the development of the society.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Development of the Nation's Legal System </F>
and National Discipline"] 
  [Excerpt] Several legal experts gave their opinions at a 
seminar on "The Prospects for the PJPT II [next 25-year 
development plan]" in Jakarta last week. They concluded that 
economic and political interests in Indonesia have made the 
nation's legal system subordinate to these two fields. The 
experts also concluded that law has never been the determining 
factor in decisions. The seminar was attended by Professor Dr. 
Sunaryati, a legal expert; Professor Dr. Sri Sumantri, dean of 
the Law Faculty at Pajajaran University; and Dr. T. Mulya Lubis, 
a legal expert. 
  The legal experts told the seminar that the legal system in 
Indonesia has been tampered with from time to time. They said 
that the government, professional institutions, businessmen, and 
the people must show the political will to strengthen the 
national legal system. At the seminar, the legal experts cited 
several concrete examples to support their allegation that the 
country's archaic legal system is no longer suitable for the 
present situation. The experts agreed, however, not to point 
out the unsuitable laws in the existing legal system, but 
instead discussed ways to seek the best replacement for those 
regarded obsolete so that future generations can observe the new 
laws. 
  Sunaryati said that we do not have to blame the old laws 
which the nation inherited from the Dutch colonial masters. 
Instead, we should think of a way to establish our own national 
laws that are free from political dominance and applicable to 
the present situation. Mulya Lubis said the current legal 
system has made the judicial institutions ineffectual purveyors 
of justice. He singled out the courts' failure to uphold 
justice when dealing with the nation's economic and business 
laws had resulted in the non-repayment of loans. In other words, 
there is no political will to settle the bad debts problem even 
though there is a clause in the law that will allow the problem 
to be settled comprehensively. 
  Actually the practice of dispensing one's own rules is not 
something new in this country. Several cases of contempt for 
the law have been discovered and efforts to uphold justice have 
been carried out by the legislative and executive branches. 
This could be seen from several documents that date back to the 
formation of the Republic of Indonesia. 
  It is interesting, however, to note the outcome of the 
seminar. This is because the topics of discussion were 
highlighted at a time when the nation is at the take-off stage 
for entry into the PJPT II. At this stage, the legal system is 
one of the most important factors in efforts to implement the 
national development targets. Definitely, every aspect of the 
legal system should be guided by the national discipline which 
is the driving factor behind the people's obedience and loyalty 
to the laws. National discipline is a norm that exists in a 
society. 
  To cite an example, the MPR [People's Consultative Assembly] 
always places national discipline as one of the dominant factors 
in the Broad Outline of State Policies [GBHN]. This means we 
have to abide by the national discipline to ensure that the our 
national development goals are achieved. [passage omitted

<F P=106> [By Romie A. Evangelista and Joe Macabalang] </F>
  [Text] The on-going peace talks between the secessionist 
Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the government may be 
stalled further as the latter stood pat on its stand not to 
allow MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari to move around Mindanao with 500 
armed bodyguards. 
  The problem could be compounded by the military's claim that 
it has uncovered an alleged plot by the MNLF to mount terrorist 
attacks in the region aimed at expanding the granting of 
autonomy to 13 provinces envisioned in the 1976 Tripoli 
Agreement. 
  Armed Forces Intelligence reports claimed that during a 
meeting in Maimbung, Sulu last December, MNLF Chairman Nur 
Misuari allegedly issued "secret orders" to his top lieutenants 
directing them to resume hostilities against the government. 
  The instructions were allegedly to spare the provinces under 
the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao composed of Basilan, 
Sulu, Maguindanao and Lanao del Sur. 
  Ambassador Manuel Yan, the government chief peace negotiator 
said they had not received such reports. 
  In yesterday's press conference at Camp Aguinaldo, Yan said 
the government will not allow Misuari with a brigade of armed 
MNLF men. 
  In Cotabato City, meanwhile, a top MNLF leader said Misuari 
"will definitely come" to pursue the stalled signing of his 
front's formal cease fire agreement with the government. 
  "Ang pagdating dito ni Chairman Misuari ay medyo naantala... 
lang dahil hindi nagkasundo ang MNLF at gobyerno sa proposal 
namin tungkol sa security escorts niya [The arrival of Chairman 
Misuari here is slightly delayed because of the disagreement 
between the MNLF and the government with regards our proposal on 
the size of the chairman's security escorts]," Al Fattah 
Abubakar, chairman of the MNLF cease fire committee said. 
  Abubakar was referring to the MNLF proposal for Misuari to 
bring a 500-man armed escort to the city for the duration of the 
scheduled signing of the truce in time with the three day 
meeting here of the RP [Republic of the Philippines]-MNLF joint 
defense and security committee. 
  The military rejected the proposal and instead endorsed 40 
Marines and 40 rebel armed escorts for the government and MNLF 
panels, respectively. This amended an alleged standing rule 
that allows only 15 armed escorts for each camp. 
  Sources said such rejection prompted Misuari not to show up 
at the compound of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao 
(ARMM), meeting venue, and forced the RP-MNLF joint defense 
committee members to shorten their three day meeting (from 
Monday to Wednesday) to two hours last Tuesday, they said. 
  But Abubakar expressed optimism that "higher authorities" 
will reconsider the MNLF original proposal because, he said, it 
was verbally agreed in Zamboanga City last week by him and DND 
[Department of National Defense] Undersecretary Feliciano Gacis, 
GRP [Government of the Republic of the Philippines] defense 
committee chairman. 
  On the basis of such optimism, Abubakar said "Chairman Nur 
Misuari will definitely come" for the signing of the truce, 
which contains detailed provisions of the cease fire pact agreed 
by the peace panels in Indonesia last November.

<F P=106> [By Frank Longid Jr. and Nelson Bagaforo] </F>
  [Text] Discussions between the working committees of 
government and Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) negotiating 
panels went smoothly last Tuesday, contrary to reports that the 
peace talks had hit a snag, government negotiators said 
yesterday. 
  There was no "failure" to sign a cease-fire agreement, they 
said, because the signing of the document was not scheduled for 
this week in the first place. 
  Government chief negotiator Manuel Yan said both sides were, 
still studying the proposed agreement, although he said it might 
be signed in the near future. "The guidelines and ground rules 
are still being studied, and after we agree on them, then that's 
when the signing will take place," Yan said. 
  What was scheduled for this week, according to Defense 
Undersecretary Feliciano Gacis, was a meeting in Cotabato City 
of joint support committee number one of which he is the 
government co-chairman." The MNLF co-chairman is Dr. Tham 
Manjoorsa. 
  The meeting, Gacis said, did not need the presence of MNLF 
Chairman Nur Misuari, as the media had reported. Misuari, 
sources in the panel said, only wanted to be present during the 
discussions, but his absence would make no difference because 
"these discussions are at the level of the support committees, 
which are `below' him (Misuari)." 
  Support committee number one is concerned with defense and 
security matters. There are four other such committees tackling 
discussions on the educational system, the financial and 
economic system, the judiciary and the administrative system. 
  The committees, Gacis pointed out, thresh out issues of 
contention in the Tripoli Agreement. 
  Gacis said the worst incident which occurred was that his 
discussions with Manjoorsa were delayed for one day "because of 
site preparation." 
  He said his meeting with Manjoorsa was cordial, and that 
they 
exchanged position papers on the topics they were scheduled to 
discuss. "After perusing the documents, we agreed that we both 
needed time to study and respond further so both sides agreed to 
meet again two weeks from now," he told a press conference in 
Camp Aguinaldo. 
  He refused to reveal the contents of the papers, saying only 
that the MNLF's was a slight modification of what they had 
submitted during the formal talks in Jakarta last year. 
Developments with regard support committee number one are 
particularly crucial since they represent what are believed to 
be the most controversial sections in the Tripoli Agreement: 
paragraphs two and eight. 
  Paragraph two, Gacis said, "states that defense matters 
shall 
be the concern of the national government provided that the 
joining of the MNLF forces with the Armed Forces of the 
Philippines will be discussed later -- so that's why we are 
discussing it." 
  "Paragraph eight says special regional security forces will 
be set up in the area of autonomy in southern Philippines 
provided that the details will be discussed later," he said. 
  "What has caused so much trouble," said an official who 
requested anonymity, "is that some have assumed that this merger 
of the MNLF and AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] and the 
setting up of regional security forces can be taken for granted 
when it's very clear that these are subject to discussion." 
  Nevertheless, Gacis said, he had already found "possible 
points of agreement" in the position papers. 
  He conceded "there are also points where we have to close 
the 
gap," and this was why both sides agreed to study the matter 
more closely before meeting again. 
  As for Misuari's reported wish to enter Cotabato City with 
500 armed bodyguards, Yan said: "In the cease-fire agreement it 
is clearly provided that both will refrain from provocative 
acts." 
  Although the agreement has yet to be signed, Representative 
Edgardo Ermita, a government negotiator, said it was already 
being observed informally by both sides. 
  Yan refused to categorically call Misuari's request as 
"provocative" saying only that "we see no need for a large 
number of (MNLF) men to secure chairman Misuari, when we have 
taken responsibility for his safety."

  [Text] The influential Organization of Islamic Conference 
(OIC) will keep its commitment to convince its member-countries 
and allies to invest in Mindanao despite the rash of terrorist 
acts in the area which may discourage foreign investors, foreign 
affairs officials said yesterday. 
  According to sources at the foreign affairs department, the 
OIC will not renege on its vow to help Mindanao on its path to 
economic recovery, since it was convinced that President Ramos 
is sincere in peacefully settling the decades-old Muslim 
secessionist movement in the southern Philippines. 
  Earlier, a high-ranking OIC official, Secretary-General 
Hamid 
al- Gabid, had committed to the president during a meeting at 
Malacanang that the 52-nation OIC would bring in investments to 
Mindanao. 
  Officials said OlC's commitment to the Ramos administration 
was a giant step in helping improve Mindanao's economy. The 
commitment is also doubly significant, according to officials, 
since the government's previous bids to seek the support of the 
OIC to assist Mindanao, were fruitless. 
  Al-Gabid, however, has committed to the president the OIC 
leadership's strong support for the Philippines' investments' 
pitch during the annual OlC foreign ministers meeting which will 
be held in Tunisia this April. 
  According to officials, al-Gabid had been satisfied during 
his visit here in seeing for himself that the president was 
committed to Mindanao's economic development and the grant of 
autonomy to Muslim-dominated areas in the region. 
  Foreign affairs officials said this view has not changed 
despite the bombings in recent weeks in Mindanao, particularly 
in Christian and Muslim religious sites. 
  Last December, the San Pedro Cathedral in Davao City was 
bombed leaving scores of people killed and hundreds injured. 
The cathedral bombings was followed by explosions which rocked 
two Muslim mosques. 
  Aside from supporting the Ramos' administration's economic 
programs for Mindanao, the OIC had also assured the government 
that it will not tolerate any moves to violate the territorial 
integrity of the Philippines.

<F P=106> [By Romy Tangbawan] </F>
  [Text] Jose Maria Sison, exiled leader of the Communist 
Party of the Philippines (CPP) yesterday accused the Ramos 
administration of "coddling (party) renegades" and threatened to 
pull out of the peace talks unless such "reprehensible" act is 
stopped. 
  "There are glaring indications that they (renegades) are 
being manipulated for a scheme of bloody intrigue," Sison said 
in a statement faxed to media outfits in Manila from the 
National Democratic Front (NDF) International Office in Utrecht, 
The Netherlands. 
  The statement named the renegades as Romulo Kintanar, Arturo 
Tabara, Filemon Lagman, and Ricardo Reyes, who are all facing 
criminal charges before the party for allegedly committing acts 
inimical to the interest of the movement. 
  Sison claimed that the NDF international office has received 
information that the four "renegades" use firearms and 
bodyguards provided by the government. 
  It said the four, under the supervision of military 
intelligence officers, have been holding caucuses and other 
activities in Metro Manila since September 1992 with the goal of 
"decapitating, discrediting, disintegrating and destroying" the 
movement. 
  Kintanar, alias Daniel Bagani or Dan, was the former chief 
of 
the New People's Army; Tabara, alias Victor del Mar, Pol, and 
Piloy, used to head the CPP Central Visayas Commission; Lagman 
also known as Carlos Forte and Popoy, heads the breakaway CPP 
Manila-Rizal Regional Committee; Reyes was former deputy 
secretary-general of the CPP-Mindanao Commission. 
  Kintanar, in particular, is being blamed by the CPP-NPA of 
introducing "gangsterism" in the movement in Davao City in 1984, 
"abuse of authority," and corruption within some party units. 
  Sison expressed concern that the four ex-rebel chiefs have 
been "openly and freely" operating in Metro Manila and 
"misrepresenting" themselves as CPP leaders despite the fact 
their expulsion from the party had been made public. 
  Sison hinted that Malacanang may not have sanctioned such 
scheme, pointing out that there are military and police 
officials who have been overruled by their superiors but who 
continue to disagree with the policy of "condoning, arming and 
funding criminal elements who have committed random killing of 
military and police officers, mass murders [sentence as 
published]." 
  But he said the "U.S.-Ramos regime cannot escape 
responsibility for any crime of intrigue committed by its 
military personnel and its Balweg-type assets against the 
patriotic and progressive forces in the Philippines." 
  Sison reminded the president, whom he addressed by his 
former 
military title "General Ramos," that similar tactics were 
applied by past administrations using the "Lava revisionists," 
"Kumander [Comrade] Melody," "Kumander Pusa," and rebel priest 
Conrado Balweg against the movement but all have failed. 
  Sison first threatened to withdraw his group from the peace 
talks after assassins killed Vicente Martinez, another former 
NPA chief, at his house in Antipolo, Rizal last week. The CPP 
described the slaying as an attempt to spark killings within the 
movement. 
  Partisans loyal to Lagman's group have blamed Sison's 
faction 
for the killing but sources from the mainstream movement said 
there is no reason for them to want Martinez killed since he is 
not among the renegades. 
  Sison suspected that government forces were behind the 
killing.

<F P=106> [By Chit Estrella and Eric Loretizo] </F>
  [Text] Exiled communist leader Jose Maria Sison yesterday 
branded the capture of Arturo Tabara, a former ranking communist 
party official, as a fake and reiterated the charge that the 
latter had turned military agent a long time ago. 
  In faxed message where he reacted to reports that the 
military had arrested Tabara and four other dissidents, Sison 
said, "The so called capture of Arturo Tabara is not a real 
capture because he has been a military asset since 1988, the 
year his wife was arrested and released upon Tabara's agreement 
to cooperate with the ISAFP (Intelligence Service of the AFP 
[Armed Forces of the Philippines]). 
  Sison, however, said it was possible the four others were 
truly captured by the military and were trapped into being so by 
Tabara. 
  "There are strong indications that Tabara surrendered his 
henchmen to the enemy. They were supposedly armed and yet did 
not offer any resistance," the CPP [Communist Party of the 
Philippines] founder said. 
  Because he believes the capture was merely staged, Sison 
said 
he would not be surprised if Tabara is soon released. 
  Moreover, "we should not be surprised if Tabara and his 
henchmen shall continue to speak and act as counterrevolutionary 
agents of the U.S.-Ramos regime and are given all the 
opportunities to do so while they are supposed to be in military 
custody," he said. 
  Tabara was one of four former CPP officials expelled from 
the 
party late last year. They were opposed to the leadership of 
Sison and have been identified as leaders of the "rejectionists" 
faction in the underground leftist movement. 
  In an interview after his capture, Tabara dared Sison to 
come 
home and lead the rebellion himself. 
  He called Sison a megalomaniac and discounted the 
possibility 
of a reunification with Sison's group. Tabara added that his 
group is forming a new "proletarian people's party" with armed 
struggle and political work as the basis of their existence. 
  Meanwhile, former Ambassador Howard Dee, head of the 
government panel negotiating with the communist groups yesterday 
admitted that he is getting impatient with the "dilly dallying" 
attitude of the communist leaders adding that delay in the talks 
will only put their group at a disadvantage. 
  "The more they make us wait, the more they can be 
marginalized," Dee said. 
  President Ramos earlier said that after 25 years of 
existence, the Communist Party of the Philippines have failed to 
successfully push their ideology and even resulted in party rift. 
  Dee said the talks is now temporarily stalled since the CPP 
leaders have yet to answer government demands that the 
preconditions to the preliminary talks pushed by CPP head Jose 
Maria Sison be removed. 
  Dee said Sison is proposing that the preliminary talks be 
held in Europe, either in Brussels, Netherlands or Luxembourg so 
that Sison who is in exile in Utrecht will have no difficulty in 
getting travel documents. 
  Dee stressed that the preliminary talks which they both 
agreed should precede the exploratory talks in Vietnam should 
tackle only the ground rules and physical arrangements for the 
talks. 
  He said the contentious issues which Sison and his groups 
want resolved before the preliminary talks should instead be 
included as agenda during the exploratory talks.

  [Text] U.S. Secretary of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen, 
accompanied by financial advisers, had a meeting with Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai at Government House for about half an 
hour today. 
  Reporting on the meeting, Finance Minister Tharin 
Nimmanhemin 
said that the subjects discussed during the meeting include 
preparations for an unofficial meeting of the finance ministers 
of the members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or 
APEC, which will be held in Hawaii, the United States, on 18-19 
March. The U.S. treasury secretary proposed that a meeting of 
senior APEC officials be held prior to the ministerial meeting. 
Tharin said Thailand will be represented by Fiscal Policy 
Office Director Somchai Ruchuphan. The meeting will discuss 
financial and monetary matters within the framework of an 
earlier discussion held by APEC leaders in terms of the economic 
development of the Asia and Pacific region with a view of 
achieving a stable, high growth rate. Discussions will also 
stress bilateral cooperation. 
  Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen said 
after an official consultation with the Thai prime minister that 
the United States is interested in expanding cooperation with 
the Asia and Pacific region. He said the United States is 
interested in reaching a conclusion with Thailand about the 
financial service sector -- Thailand is at a disadvantage from 
the conditions of the just-concluded GATT round of trade talks 
and seeks to begin talks at a bilateral level. It is believed 
that future negotiations will help Thailand settle the problems. 
He said the United States adheres to the principle of trade 
expansion, which equally benefits its trading partners in Asia. 
  Asked by the mass media about U.S. assistance and 
cooperation 
for Asian countries, the U.S. secretary of treasury said 
Thailand and Indonesia can play an important role in expanding 
cooperation to other countries within the framework of trade 
liberalization which is supported by the United States.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The spokesman of the Cambodian 
Information Ministry, Sieng Lapresse, made an observation to the 
media on the support by some Thai military officials for the 
Khmer Rouge. 
  On this issue, Rawi Hongpraphat, the deputy director of the 
Foreign Ministry's Information Department and deputy ministry 
spokesman, said that he did not wish to make a rebuttal, adding 
that the prime minister's visit clearly demonstrated Thailand's 
stand: that is, Thailand wanted Cambodia to be confident in the 
former's attitude toward it, and it wanted to further strengthen 
relations with the Cambodian Government. 
  To date Thailand has displayed its sincerity, Rawi said. 
Therefore, he could not understand the reason for the repeated 
negative news. If there was anything Cambodia had wanted to 
know, it could have made inquiries through the Thai Embassy, as 
agreed upon by both sides concerning the dissemination of 
information and news conferences. 
  In any event, the deputy foreign ministry spokesman is 
confident that the prime minister's visit will promote a good 
climate and provide direction for Thai-Cambodian relations. 
This is because support for the Khmer Rouge is not the policy 
of the Thai Government or a basis of operations of the Thai 
armed forces. If there are allegations about any involvement by 
Thai military officials without the knowledge of the armed 
forces, it is the duty of the armed forces to investigate.

  [Excerpt] First Army Commander Chettha Thanacharo 
yesterday played down a comment by a Cambodian Information 
Ministry spokesman that there were still "bad seeds" in the Thai 
military who continue to support the Khmer Rouge. 
  "If he wants to speak, let him do so. But I believe in the 
truth. The world knows it is not possible for us to still 
support the guerrillas," Chettha said. 
  Spokesman Sieng Lapresse attacked Thai military recently in 
the Phnom Penh press, which quoted him as saying that some Thai 
military officers were against the government's stated policy 
not to support the Khmer Rouge. 
  "They have a bad Thai military (element) in there that 
supports the Khmer Rouge against Thai policy. Let's get the bad 
seeds out of there," Sieng said. 
  Chettha said the government and the military have made it 
clear that they stopped providing arms to the Khmer Rouge after 
the Paris peace accords were signed in 1991. 
  Thailand, instead, had played a vital role in restoring 
peace 
to the beleaguered country. 
  "We always assist the legitimate government. But they still 
dig up the past. We can't stop them from rnaking such 
comments," he said. 
  Chettha expressed confidence that Cambodian criticism and 
suspicions would cease as a result of Prime Minister Chuan 
Likphai's current trip to Phnom Penh. He urged the public to 
put its trust in the govemment. 
  He also called on the press to understand Thailand's 
position 
and help boost understanding. He said Thailand had made many 
contributions to Cambodia, including building infrastructure and 
schools. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan yesterday also 
insisted that the Thai military had stopped providing assistance 
to the Khmer Rouge. 
  "All branches of the armed forces have confirrned to me that 
they no longer support the Khmer Rouge. Once such an assistance 
was given. But now it is an old issue," said Banyat. [passage

  [Excerpts] Thailand doubts whether the proposed East Asia 
Economic Caucus (EAEC) will be of any benefit since many of its 
prospective members already have a strong organisation in the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) [passage omitted] 
  Sources at the Commerce and Foreign Affairs ministries said 
that besides Malaysia, only Japan appears enthusiastic about the 
idea. 
  The Commerce source said that since the conclusion of the 
Uruguay Round of world trade talks Japan has favoured an 
organisation to counter what it sees as Washington's increased 
bargaining power. 
  The ASEAN Secretariat was assigned last October to sound out 
whether other countries outside ASEAN would support the 
establishment of EAEC. But discussions with officials in China, 
Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea have revealed neither strong 
support nor outright rejection of the proposal. [passage omitted] 
  "EAEC is in the middle between ASEAN and APEC but it is 
still 
doubtful how members would benefit from EAEC as some already 
have a strong organisation in ASEAN, so why not expand ASEAN to 
cover other countries?" asked the Commerce source. 
  He said he thought that the visit of a Malaysian delegation 
led by International Trade and Industry Minister Dato' Seri 
Rafidah Aziz to Thailand and other ASEAN countries this week was 
meant to lobby for the establishment of EAEC. [passage omitted] 
  But he said there was no guarantee that EAEC would 
strengthen 
the region's bargaining power -- that would depend on the 
direction APEC takes. If APEC evolves into a bona fide trade 
bloc, EAEC would become irrelevant since all its prospective 
members would prefer to cooperate under the APEC umbrella. 
  EAEC would have better prospects if it included non-APEC 
members such as the Indochinese countries, the source predicted.

  [Excerpt] THE Government has refused to sell some 200,000 
tons of 100 percent white rice to Iran and has asked Iranian 
representatives to contract with the private sector instead, 
according to Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon. 
  Mr Uthai made the comment yesterday after meeting with the 
chairman of Iran's Government Trading Cooperative, Mahmoud 
Ardakani. 
  Iran proposed to buy the rice on credit from the Thai 
Government with delivery scheduled for March but Mr Uthai said 
the authority to do that now rests with the Rice Policy 
Committee chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan. 
  Mr Uthai said does not want to intervene in the 
private-sector rice market. He said the Government has not 
entirely ruled out government-to-government sales but he 
believes the private sector should have the first opportunity to 
make deals. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Deng Nan, daughter of the Chinese paramount leader 
and vice minister of the Chinese state Science and Technology 
Commission, said yesterday that China considers Thailand and 
other Southeast Asian countries an important area for developing 
scientific and technological cooperation. 
  Deng Nan, who is on a visit to Thailand, made the above 
remarks during a meeting with Thai Foreign Minister Prasong 
Sunsiri. Prasong agreed with Deng Nan's views. 
  Deng Nan said that the Joint Chinese-Thai Scientific and 
Technological Commission has held 12 meetings since its 
establishment. Technological cooperation and exchange items 
carried out by the two countries have achieved remarkable 
success. 
  She said that China and Thailand have their own strong 
points 
in the field of science and technology. They should strengthen 
cooperation in this area. She hoped that the two countries will 
further strengthen their cooperation in the fields of high and 
new science and technology and in applied science and 
technology, which will be beneficial to the economic development 
of both countries. 
  "China carries out scientific and technological cooperation 
not only with developed countries, but also with developing 
countries," Deng Nan said. 
  During a recent meeting of senior ASEAN officials in 
Bangkok, 
they agreed that ASEAN will expand its scientific and 
technological cooperation with China this year. 
  Deng Nan is on a visit to ASEAN countries to strengthen 
scientific and technological exchanges with ASEAN. 
  Prasong said that Thailand and other ASEAN countries are 
willing to conduct further scientific and technological 
cooperation with China. Prasong also asked Deng Nan to convey 
his regards to Deng Xiaoping. He wished Deng Xiaoping good 
health and a long life. He also expressed his hope that China, 
under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's blueprint, will achieve 
even greater success in national construction. 
  Deng Nan will call on Prime Minister Chuan Likphai today. 
Deng Pufang and Deng Lin, Deng Xiaoping's eldest son and eldest 
daughter, also visited Thailand late last year.

  [Text] The prime minister said the cabinet decision 
requiring the Defense Ministry to buy weapons through barter 
deals involves only certain possible cases, and this is meant to 
benefit the national economy. 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said that the policy on weapons 
purchases is just a matter of principle involving certain cases 
where it is possible for Thailand to negotiate with its trading 
partners to sell its products in exchange. The prime minister 
thinks that the Commerce Ministry should be allowed to take part 
in the negotiation since the Defense Ministry is not very good 
at it. 
  [Begin recording] [Chuan] The minister in charge of the 
deal, such as the defense minister when it concerns the Defense 
Ministry, would look after the matter. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Was the decision adopted by the 
cabinet motivated by the issue of commissions? 
  [Chuan] Not directly. It was not directly aimed at barring 
the business of brokers. It rather concerns the case of the 
Defense Ministry buying weapons from a country which, we think, 
can buy our products in exchange. 
  [Reporter] Did the Defense Ministry bring up possible 
problems which may arise? 
  [Chuan] The Defense Ministry often told us that it is not 
enthusiastic about trade. 
  [Reporter] Even though it could prevent the paying of 
commissions [words indistinct]? 
  [Chuan] I think that is a different matter. [end recording]

  [Text] PRIME Minister Chuan Likphai has endorsed a 
National Security Council [NSC] request to transform 5.6 million 
baht worth of budget allocated for this year's spending into a 
secret fund. 
  Government sources said the Cabinet would be informed to 
acknowledge the change. 
  The NSC had told the Premier it wanted to use the money for 
secret operations because the projects to which the money had 
been originally allocated were no longer necessary or had been 
completed. 
  Of the money involved, 603,500 baht had been allocated for 
public relations work. 
  The other five million baht had been earmarked for solving 
southern banditry problems, the sources said.

  [Editorial Report] Two Bangkok Chinese-language dailies -- 
XING XIAN RIBAO and ZHONG HUA RIBAO -- carry two reports and a 
congratulatory message identifying some prominent members of 
local Chinese associations from 31 December 1993 to 11 January 
1994 
  Bangkok XING XIAN RIBAO on 31 December 1993, in a report on 
page 4, says former U.S. President George Bush received a group 
of U.S. businessmen from Hong Kong financial circles and some 
overseas Chinese businessmen during a recent stopover in Hong 
Kong. Yao Zongxia [1202 1350 0204], honorary chairman of the 
Tae Chiu Association of Thailand, honorary chairman of the Jie 
Shou Foundation, and president of the Tai Lian Machinery Company 
was on a business trip in Hong Kong. He had a chance to meet 
with the former U.S. president during a party. The report says 
that during the talks, Bush praised Thailand's rapid economic 
development. 
  Bangkok ZHONG HUA RIBAO on 10 January 1994, on page 12, 
publicizes a congratulatory message by the 23d Executive 
Committee of the Hainanese Association of Thailand. According to 
the message, some prominent figures of the executive committee 
are as follows: Ou Zongqing [2962 1350 3237] -- [Bangkok Bureau 
records show he runs a real estate business], Ye Shizhong [0673 
0013 1813], and Pan Yi [3382 3015] are advisors of the 
association's 23d executive committee; Zheng Youying [6774 2589 
5391] -- [Bangkok Bureau records list his Thai family name as 
Chirathiwat and he is the president of the Central Department 
Store group; his family also runs the Central Plaza Hotel 
Company, real estate, and other businesses] -- is the chairman; 
Wu Duolu [0702 1122 4389] -- [Bangkok Bureau records list his 
Thai name as Dilok Mahadamrongkun; his family is a major 
shareholder of the Saim City Bank and also is engaged in the 
watch business], Chen Xiubing [7115 0208 3521], and Chen Mingan 
[7115 2494 1344] are the vice chairmen. 
  Bangkok XING XIAN RIBAO on 11 January 1994, in a report on 
page 5, says that the Fujianese Association of Thailand held a 
special party for its members on 9 January, during which the 
55th executive committee officially took office. According to 
the report, Huang Yonglin [7806 3057 2651] is the permanent 
honorary chairman of the association's 55th executive committee. 
Su Guoshi [5685 0948 0013] -- [Bangkok Bureau records list his 
Thai family name as Sosothikun; his family runs the Seacon 
Company and shoe, monosodium glutamate manufacturing, and real 
estate businesses] is honorary chairman. Zhang Jianlu [1728 
1696 4389] is the chairman. Cai Zhiwei [5591 1807 0251] --

  [Text] Deputy Foreign Ministry Spokesman Rawi Hongpraphat 
yesterday rejected suggestions that Saudi Arabia had reopened 
its door to Thai workers. 
  Lt Rawi's comment followed a report from a government MP 
early last month that Saudi Arabia would offer 60,000 jobs to 
Thai workers. 
  At about the same time, Saudi Arabian Charge d'Affaires 
Mohamed Said Khoja said Thai workers were welcome to apply for 
visas to go to his country. 
  Riyadh has stopped issuing visas to Thai workers since 
relations soured some four years ago following the murder of 
three Saudi embassy staffers and a businessman in Bangkok as 
well as the theft of jewels from the Saudi royal palace. 
  According to Lt Rawi, no clear-cut policy on Thai workers 
has 
emerged from Riyadh, where two separate ministries--Home Affairs 
and Labour-- deal with questions of visas and work permits. 
  Lt Rawi also noted that wages in Saudi Arabia had dropped 
significantly, with workers from India, Pakistan and the 
Philippines being paid only half the amount that Thai workers 
used to earn.

<F P=106> ["Press Communique" by the spokesman of the National Army of </F>
Democratic Kampuchea dated 12 January; place not given -- read 
by announcer] 
  [Text] Press communique by the spokesman of the National 
Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] condemning the two-headed 
government, which is a foreign lackey, for using a MiG warplane 
and rockets to attack the houses of the inhabitants at Chreh 
village, Reang Khvay commune, Leach Disrtrict, Pursat Province: 
  1. On 8 January at 1100, a MiG warplane fired many rockets 
on the houses of the inhabitants in Chreh village, Reang Khvay 
commune, Leach District, Pursat Province. As a result, many 
houses were damaged, and a number of cattle were killed. 
  2. The NADK wishes to join our nation and people in 
vehemently denouncing and condemning the criminal activities 
against the aforementioned people committed by the two-headed 
government whose masters are the communist Vietnamese and an 
alliance. 
  3. The action by the two-headed government constitutes a 
continuation of the communist Vietnamese aggressors' policy of 
eradicating the Cambodian race and an action against the king 
and the Cambodian nation and people, who have repeatedly called 
for national reconciliation to restore peace in accordance with 
the five-point initiative of his majesty. 
  For more than six months, the two-headed government group 
has 
done nothing but stubbornly continue the war to destroy the 
nation and people at will. Also, it has given Vietnam a free 
hand to ship its people to Cambodia -- the Vietnamese in the 
country now number nearly 4 million -- and to cut off and seize 
part of Cambodia's maritime territory and some of the country's 
islands. Their crimes are extremely serious. The people in 
both the rural and urban areas and those living abroad are 
judging their crimes and sentencing them. 
  No force is more vigorous than the people's force. 
Aggressors, old and new alike, have already tested the 
Cambodian people's force. The latter have no intention 
whatsoever to eliminate anybody; they only want to achieve 
national reconciliation in compliance with the five-point plan 
of the king so that the nation can regain peace and the people 
can have the opportunity to earn a living, look after their 
families, and rebuild a Cambodia with genuine independence, 
unity, and territorial integrity as in the epoch preceding 1970. 
  [Dated] 12 January 1994 
  [Signed] NADK spokesman

  [Text] JAKARTA, Jan 14 (AFP) -- The Indonesian navy has 
deployed four ships, including three frigates, in a two-month 
naval operation to safeguard the waters near Natuna islands in 
South China Sea, a navy spokesman said here Friday. 
  "The operation is aimed at maintaining security in the area 
and to anticipate the possible visits of Cambodian and 
Vietnamese boat people who are often found visiting the 
islands," Indonesian West Fleet Spokesman Lieutenant Colonel 
Sunarto Wibow told AFP by telephone. 
  "Although we do not receive any more reports on piracy in 
the 
past 12 months we have to stay alert," he said, adding the 
operation would end in February. 
  Sunarto said the "Natuna Jaya Operation" involved three 
frigates and a supporting tanker ship.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA Jan 13 -- Dialogue between nations on 
common issues of the world has the effect of narrowing down 
disagreement while promoting mutual understanding, said Deputy 
Foreign Minister Le Mai on Thursday. 
  This trend is growing in present-day international 
relations, 
he said in an interview granted to VIETNAM NEWS AGENCY. 
  Le Mai said each nation has the responsibility of 
guaranteeing human rights within its territorial boundaries. He 
also acknowledged that human rights were the concern of the 
world community as a whole. 
  He said Vietnam agreed to talk with other countries on human 
rights because it wanted those countries to understand that the 
people of Vietnam had given so much for man's sacred fundamental 
rights on this land, and were making tremendous efforts in all 
fields -- political, economic, cultural and social -- to ensure 
human rights in their country. 
  "We will talk with other countries", Le Mai said, "so that a 
correct understanding can be had on the fundamental principles 
of an international law on human rights, namely respect for 
national independence and national sovereignty, respect for the 
right of nations to self-determination, particularly the right 
for each to choose its own path of development, respect for 
national, community of individual rights, respect for political, 
civil, economic and social right of the citizen and respect for 
the right of nations for development which is now a topical 
problem of the world". [sentence as received] 
  Le Mai dismissed recent press reports about dialogue on 
"certain aspects of human rights in Vietnam". "Vietnam and 
other countries have agreed that their exchanges of views will 
be conducted on the basis of equality, mutual respect and 
non-interference", he stressed. 
  Le Mai said he believed the talks would be positive and 
constructive. "If our interlocutors can say concretely where 
and how our law does not conform strictly to international law 
we will [words indistinct] seriously and refer them to 
Vietnamese competent bodies for consideration". 
  "At the same time we will try to make other countries share 
our views that man's most fundamental rights are national self- 
determination and development, which must be strictly 
respected," Le Mai added. 
  He said he hoped the world community, through dialogue, 
would 
gradually establish mutual respect and [words indistinct] and 
equal, mutually beneficial cooperation on human rights. 
  "Human rights should not be used as a tool for one country 
to 
impose on, or interfere in, another country", Le Mai concluded.

Cambodia on Jan. 11 strongly condemned the Khmer Rouge for 
kidnapping two Vietnamese residents when they were fishing in 
Kompong Chhnang Province of Cambodia on Dec. 29, 1993. 
  In a note lodged to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and

brother Mr Le Van Sen, 33, while they were fishing on a river 
near the town of Kompong Chhnang. 
  The note strongly condemned that criminal act taken by the 
Khmer Rouge against the Vietnamese residents in Cambodia, and 
requested the Cambodian Government to immediately take drastic 
measures in order to bring the criminals to trial and stop such 
actions of the Khmer Rouge to ensure the lives, property and 
normal life for all Vietnamese residents in Cambodia.

  [Text] In Ho Chi Minh City recently, the Tank and Armored 
Force [TAF] Command held a seminar on its building and training 
tasks during the past period. General Doan Khue, member of the 
party Central Committee Political Bureau and minister of 
National Defense attended the seminar. 
  The TAF commander delivered a report on the activities of 
the 
force during the past few years. He pointed to its great 
efforts in improving its organization and personnel to meet the 
requirements of localities, military regions, and key strategic 
areas. 
  Despite numerous difficulties in equipment, budget, and 
facilities, the TAF has closely coordinated with the army corps, 
military regions, and localities to build and strengthen its 
units, improve training, and maintain combat readiness. The 
force has also striven to recruit and train new cadres, 
specialized personnel, and workers. Various units of the force 
have consistently improved training and fulfilled all their 
assigned tasks. They have closely combined the task of building 
firm and comprehensively strong units with that of modernizing 
and standardizing the army. 
  The seminar provided ample time for delegates of the army 
corps, military regions, and military units to discuss and 
exchange experiences on training and maintaining the spirit of 
combat readiness, military and joint operations, and other tasks 
related to national defense. 
  Speaking at the seminar, the minister stressed: In building 
and training, the TAF should implement the motto: firmly 
maintain basic principles and effectively apply past combat 
experiences. Cadres of the force must carefully study the 
enemy's capabilities while formulating concrete plans and 
projects to enhance the quality of training at various units. 
They must also strive to fulfill their tasks in order to attain 
standardization, build comprehensively strong units, set up firm 
and strong defense zones, and step by step advance toward 
modernizing the army. These are essential tasks for making the 
TAF units strong and firm so that they can fulfill new tasks and 
meet the requirements under all circumstances for the cause of 
national defense and construction.

<F P=106> [Report on a news conference by U.S. Admiral Charles Larson </F>
with foreign and domestic correspondents in Hanoi on 17 January] 
  [Text] Dear friends: Admiral Charles Larson, commander of 
U.S. forces in the Asia-Pacific region, paid a visit to Vietnam 
from 16 January with the aim of seeking more knowledge and 
accelerating the cooperation between the U.S. and Vietnam in 
solving the Americans missing in action [MIA] during the Vietnam 
War. 
  Admiral Larson held an international news conference in 
Hanoi 
after his meetings with Vietnamese leaders. The following is 
the report from a Vietnamese radio correspondent on the contents 
of the news conference: 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent] A committee to investigate 
MIA cases during the Vietnam War was formed in January 1992 and 
an office in Hanoi was opened. The committee has been in 
operation for two years. In the past two years, this committee 
of five American soldiers -- including Naval, Marine, and Air 
Force personnel -- conducted 26 joint searches with the 
Vietnamese side to seek information about American soldiers 
dying and missing during the war. 
  From 6-28 March this year, the committee will form four 
search teams and four recovery teams with 84 people to conduct 
the 27th joint search -- the biggest search ever. Admiral 
Charles Larson, commander of U.S. forces in the Asia-Pacific 
region, paid a visit to Vietnam on 16 January in view of the 
importance of this search. He directly met with Vietnamese 
leaders to deal with the settlement of the MIA issue. He also 
directly met with American and Vietnamese, who have taken part 
in the searches and directly inspected the search sites. He was 
the highest U.S. military official to visit Vietnam since the 
end of the Vietnam War. 
  After two days, Admiral Larson held an international news 
conference on 17 January in Hanoi to disclose the results of his 
Vietnam visit and offer his opinions on the search activities in 
Vietnam. Speaking to correspondents, he said: 
  [Larson, in English fading into Vietnamese translation] We 
have conducted 846 searches and 59 excavations in Vietnam since 
the formation of our special force in January 1982. And we have 
learned many things. I am pleased to say that our country sent 
5,600 notices to MIA families over the last year in a program 
that provides information to MIA families. I am also pleased at 
the efforts of the five people working on the sites. This 
requires good leadership, planning, and great effort. I can 
promise that I will try my best to achieve the possible in the 
search for missing people. I come here to witness the 
cooperation and effort from both sides. I met high-ranking 
Vietnamese leaders, specialists, and archivists. 
  [Correspondent] In response to a Chinese reporter's question 
about his assessment of the Vietnamese cooperation in this 
aspect, Mr. Larson said: 
  [Larson, in English fading into Vietnamese translation] I 
would say two things: First, we have found ever-increasing 
cooperation over the past two years since the task force began 
its work here. Second, if this cooperation was not good, I 
would not be here and would not appear in this uniform to see 
those people whom I have met. My assessment is that there has 
been very good cooperation. 
  [Correspondent] Answering a question about the U.S. plan to 
search for servicemen missing in action, Mr. Larson said: 
  [Larson, in English fading into Vietnamese translation] It 
needs to take into account all issues. We will do all we can, 
ranging from the evaluation of information on American 
servicemen, who are reported to be alive, to disinformation and 
other efforts. So far, throughout various searches and all the 
things we have done, we do not find any evidence indicating that 
there are American servicemen alive in Vietnam and Southeast 
Asia. However, we cannot and will not rule out that possibility 
until we have checked all the information available. 
  [Correspondent] A Radio Voice of Vietnam correspondent 
asked: 
Do you have any idea about the assistance the U.S. Government 
will give to Vietnam in resolving its humanitarian issues? 
  Mr. Larson said: [Larson, in English fading into Vietnamese 
translation] I think that the humanitarian issue exists and that 
just like us, they view the humanitarian issue as a very 
delicate matter. I think that our two countries have realized 
this is an issue and the two sides are cooperating to resolve 
it. I am very pleased to see that my government has realized 
this and it knows how to undertake it. During his visit to 
Vietnam in December 1993, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State 
Winston Lord took with him a large dossier which I had the 
opportunity to read this morning at the joint archive center. 
We hope that this dossier will be useful in providing some 
information to those families with missing relatives. We will 
try to do what we can to help Vietnamese families concerned and 
we hope that we will receive reciprocal assistance from the 
Vietnamese people. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Relations between Vietnam and the United States of 
America are witnessing diversified activities that make many 
international observers question whether the two countries are 
entering a new stage. Here is our radio review of U.S.-Vietnam 
relations: 
  Many reports about the visits to Vietnam by six American 
delegations have emanated from Hanoi this month. The first 
visit was by Washington senators [word indistinct] the most 
senior U.S. active-duty office to visit Vietnam, Admiral Charles 
Larson, commander-in-chief of the U.S. Pacific Command. 
Meanwhile, the latest search for the remains of American 
servicemen missing in action is now underway in 15 provinces and 
cities throughout Vietnam. And American politicians continue to 
voice positive remarks about Vietnam. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher recently said: 
Considerable information on the MIA issue has been achieved. 
This was due, he said, to positive cooperation and goodwill 
from Vietnam. 
  Senator John Kerry, a leading player in the search for 
American soldiers missing in action said last week: Vietnamese 
Government and people have done their best in cooperating with 
the U.S. to settle the issue. Pending issues were created by 
the U.S., not Vietnam. He further noted that the U.S. should 
continue the internal struggle to dismantle obstacles that 
hinder the normalization of relations between the two countries. 
  A significant number of American politicians and people now 
want to lift the embargo against Vietnam and to normalize 
relations with Vietnam. 
  In a recent Gallup poll held in the USA last year, among 
over 
1,000 questioned people, 58 percent supported normalization with 
Vietnam. And the NEW YORK TIMES commented that the most legal 
reason to lift the sanctions was that it was no more in 
conformity with the interests of the U.S. itself. While the 
whole world was now having free-trade ties with Hanoi, the 
embargo punishes American businessmen. It would be much better 
if the U.S. lifts the embargo. Nevertheless, if the U.S. still 
keeps its outdated attitude, Vietnam will continue to develop 
its cooperative relations with other countries. Now the ball 
[is] in the American court. The question is whether the U.S. is 
breaking up [words indistinct] proposals raised by American 
politicians, people, and businessmen.

Van Kiet received at the government office Senator Kerry, member 
of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who came for a 
courtesy call. 
  Also present were Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai and a 
representative of the Government Office. 
  Senator Kerry briefed the prime minister on the purposes of 
his visit to Vietnam, and greatly appreciated the results of his 
meetings and the meetings of other U.S. delegations with senior 
officials of the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and some 
offices concerned. He viewed these meetings as discussions of 
important significance aimed at contributing to strengthening 
the mutual understanding and promoting the normalization of the 
U.S.- Vietnamese relations. 
  The senator noted that on the MIA issue, the two countries 
had engaged in a process of perfect cooperation, and that 
cooperation is developing its effect. The government and people 
of Vietnam, he also noted, have tried their best to cooperate 
with the U.S. side in the search for American missing in action 
[MIA] as well as in the supply of information on the American 
MIAs in Vietnam. The issue now is not in the Vietnamese court 
but rather on the American side. 
  His excellency the senator said: Enduring untold suffering 
in 
the past, the Vietnamese people are now cooperating with the 
U.S. side. They have, however, not been compensated 
appropriately for what they have done. The U.S. side will 
continue to struggle within its own ranks to overcome the 
obstacle -- the MIA issue -- in the normalization of 
U.S.-Vietnamese relations, trying to achieve rapid progress in 
the U.S.-Vietnamese relations. 
  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet hailed Senator Kerry and other 
Americans of goodwill for having expressed their views and 
working actively to support the normalization of U.S.-Vietnamese 
relations for the sake of peace, stability, and development in 
Southeast Asia as well for their cooperation in the MIA issue, 
thus helping press ahead with gradually-improving 
U.S.-Vietnamese relations. 
  The prime minister affirmed: It is Vietnam's consistent 
policy on the MIA issue to do its utmost for humanitarian 
purposes. Satisfactory resolution of the MIA issue will create 
mutual understanding and mutual trust with which to resolve 
other issues related to the interests of the two nations. 
  The prime minister said: Although each country has its own 
difficulties and advantages, while resolving their domestic 
difficulties, the two countries should strive to avoid creating 
impact on each other. Vietnam has been and is doing that, and 
hopes that the U.S. side will do likewise in order to contribute 
to creating favorable conditions for the process of normalizing 
U.S.-Vietnamese relations 
  The prime minister asked his excellency the senator to 
convey 
to the U.S. President Vietnam's view that it was time for the 
two countries to make a new decision on bilateral relations, and 
the earlier that Vietnam-U.S. relations are normalized, the more 
favorable will be the conditions created for the development of 
cooperative relations in various fields in conformity with the 
interests of both countries. 
  The prime minister also asked his excellency the senator to 
convey his New Year greetings to the U.S. people. 
  Also, on the afternoon of 14 January, Chairman of the 
National Assembly Nong Duc Manh received Senator Kerry at his 
office. 
  Senator Kerry expressed his pleasure over the meeting with 
the National Assembly chairman and considered that event very 
important, ushering in opportunities for cooperation between the 
Vietnamese National Assembly and the U.S. Congress. He also 
thanked Chairman Nong Duc Manh and the Vietnamese authorities 
for their hospitality to him and his party, and said that his 
Vietnam visits had left him with fine impressions of the land 
and people of Vietnam. 
  Chairman Nong Duc Manh expressed his hope that the results 
of the visit would contribute to strengthening the mutual 
understanding between the two legislatures and the two peoples. 
Prompted by the humanitarian spirit and profound sympathies 
toward the families of Americans missing in action, the 
Vietnamese National Assembly and people would continue their 
cooperation with the U.S. side for the settlement of the MIA 
issue. 
  The U.S. delegation also had working sessions with Foreign 
Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and representatives of the Vietnam MIA 
Office. 
  On the afternoon of 15 January, the delegation left Hanoi 
for Ho Chi Minh City and Danang prior to its departure for home.

said, will contribute to the promotion of their bilateral 
relations. The Vietnamese leader reaffirmed that Vietnam's 
consistent policy on the MIA issue was to do its best for the 
humnitarian purpose. He held that should the MIA issue be 
settled well, it would create mutual understanding and trust for 
the settlement of other issues relating to the interests of the 
two countries. 
  P.M. Vo Van Kiet asked Mr. Kerry to convey to the U.S. 
President Vietnam's viewpoint that it was time for the two 
countries to have a new decision on bilateral relations, and the 
earlier the Vietnam-U.S. relations are normalized the more 
favourable conditions would be created for the development of 
the cooperative relations in various fields in conformity with 
the interests of the two countries.

hope that the results of the visit would contribute to 
strengthening the mutual understanding between the two 
legislatures and the people of Vietnam and the U.S. Prompted by

continue their cooperation with the U.S. side in the settlement 
of the MIA issue.

  [Text] Hanoi, Jan 17 (AFP) -- The Vietnamese Communist 
Party's Central Committee began a 48-hour extraordinary session 
Monday to prepare for the party's national conference which 
opens Thursday, well-informed Vietnamese sources said. 
  During the meeting, the party's highest authorities are 
expected to discuss Secretary General Do Muoi's political report 
and Central Committee personnel changes, the sources said. 
  Both issues were discussed at the sixth Central Committee 
plenum last November and taken up again at the National 
Assembly's second annual session in December in Hanoi. 
  According to an official Vietnamese source, 15 of the 145 
Central Committee members will be replaced during the 
conference, the first time one has been held between two 
Congresses. 
  Politburo personalities and government officials might also 
be replaced, the informed sources said. In addition to the 
replacement of political personnel, the task of this 
"mini-Congress" is to make a political point of "doi moi" or 
renovation, promised since 1987, by discussing the rhythm of 
economic reforms and defining the direction to take until the 
eighth Congress in 1996. 
  The 649 delegates who will attend the six-day party 
conference include Central Committee members and representatives 
of the army, the provinces, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and 
organizations such as the Homeland Front, the Women's Union and 
labor unions. 
  Observers say it is unlikely that the regime will slow the 
pace of economic reforms. However, some leaders have called for 
a slowdown, even a pause, in the economic liberalization process 
out of fear that opening the economy to the outside world could 
lead to social unrest and political destabilization. 
  On Monday, the army's daily newspaper QUAN DOI NHAN DAN, 
considered close to conservative circles, called for 
"maintaining and consolidating political stability" while 
reaffirming "the choice of economic reforms along socialist 
lines." 
  "The painful lessons of the Soviet bloc have shown that 
social turmoil would lead to a political crisis," the newspaper 
said after launching a new warning against "hostile forces" that 
seek to "overthrow the socialist regime, sabotage the 
modernization work and destroy the party's leading role." 
  "Political modernization is a very sensitive question that 
must be conducted in a progressive and wise manner," the 
newspaper said, adding that "it is not absolutely necessary to 
sacrifice political interests to benefit economic development." 
  "We are determined to maintain the party's leading role, and 
we will accept neither pluralism nor multi-partyism, the 
newspaper stressed, saying that "revolutionary gains can only be 
defended by political stability." 
  Former party members, close to dissident intellectuals, have 
recently criticized the single-party system and called for a 
change in the Communist Party's leadership.

Committee's Ideology and Culture Department recently held a news 
conference to announce the mid-term party conference. 
  The Seventh CPV Central Committee decided to hold the

the party statutes. Empowered by the party Central Committee, 
the Political Bureau decided that the mid-term national party 
conference will open in Hanoi on 20 January 1994 and will meet 
until 25 January 1994.

implementation of the Seventh Party Congress resolution, sum up 
the actual results of the renovation process obtained since the 
Sixth Party Congress, and define major policies and measures 
aimed at successfully implementing the Seventh Party Congress 
resolution. 
  The conference will hold a by-election to chose a number of

649 delegates, three advisers to the CPV Central Committee, and 
10 former Political Bureau members. 
  The Political Bureau affirms that the mid-term national 
party 
conference will be a major party conference and an important 
event in the political life of our party and people and that it, 
however, is not a party congress. The conference will be 
organized in a solemn fashion, but it should bear the character 
of an internal meeting. Its activities should be carried out in 
a practical, effective, and thrifty manner without any showy 
displays and ceremonies.

  [Text] The Border Defense Corps Command recently held a 
conference in Hanoi to review its five-year (1989-94) emulation 
movement to maintain national security. 
  Over 250 delegates, who are either heroes or outstanding 
combatants and who represented various hero units and those

  Despite the complex situation, the border defense force has

in maintaining border security and carrying out border patrols. 
  Comrade Bui Thien Ngo, minister of interior, addressed the 
conference and hailed the achievements and the many great 
contributions made by the Border Defense Corps over the years to 
maintaining our security and sovereignty at various border areas. 
  The comrade urged the cadres and combatants of the Border 
Defense Corps to overcome training difficulties, maintain and 
improve their militancy, remain always vigilant against new 
enemy schemes, remain united to build and consolidate their 
force so it will become increasingly stronger; and hold their 
arms firmly to defend various border areas of the fatherland. 
  Comrade Bui Thien Ngo availed himself of the opportunity to

Certificates of Commendation to many units and individuals with 
achievements in the maintenance of national security.

  [Text] Senior General Doan Khue, minister of national 
defense, recently visited a number of units stationed in Ho Chi 
Minh City [HCMC], such as the Ba Son enterprise and a computer 
center under the Institute of Military Technologies. He also 
visited Infantry Officers School No. 2 -- where he inspected 
academic and scholastic activities -- and the X-51 Naval 
Machineworks. 
  The senior general was accompanied by Vice Admiral Mai Xuan 
Vinh of the Naval Command and other comrades representing 
various offices in the Ministry of National Defense. 
  The comrade director of the X-51 Machineworks briefed the 
comrade senior general on the growth of his machineworks. He 
said that the naval ship-repair and ship-building plant, which 
serves as a main technical maintenance base for ships from the 
Spratly archipelago and the DK-1 special zone in the southern 
part of the country, has achieved rapid growth over the past 18 
years. Having started by building wooden boats, metal landing 
craft, and river and sea-going ships between 200 and 350 
deadweight tons [dwt], the machineworks can now build 500-dwt 
ships capable of operating for many days at sea. 
  Senior General Doan Khue was shown around. He visited a 
naval cargo ship built by the X-51 machineworks, a pier, and 
various workshops of the machineworks. He hailed the cadres and 
workers of the machineworks for trying hard to overcome 
difficulties and ensure the satisfactory implementation of 
national defense tasks. In 1994, he said, the Ministry of 
National Defense will provide the machineworks with financial 
assistance so it can buy modern equipment and achieve further 
growth to serve the army and national defense.

  [Text] Bangkok, Jan 18 (AFP) -- The head of the main 
association of Burmese students in exile, Moe Thee Zun, has been 
arrested along with 11 comrades by their allies in the Karen 
National Union (KNU), a communique received here Tuesday said. 
  The communique, issued by the All Burma Students Democratic 
Front (ABSDF), said the 12 had been detained Sunday in 
Mannerplaw, the headquarters of the ethnic Karen insurrection, 
located on the Thai border. 
  It also accused the KNU of handing down an ultimatum to all 
students in the area to hand over their weapons to the KNU. The 
ultimatum reportedly expired at dawn Monday. 
  An official with the KNU said he was unable to confirm or 
deny the report. 
  The ABSDF said the 12 had been detained "without any 
apparent 
reason" and demanded their release. The KNU is the oldest and 
most powerful opposition group battling the ruling junta, or 
State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), which holds 
power in Rangoon. Other opposition groups came together last 
week to support the KNU in opening peace talks with the SLORC. 
  The KNU has around 1,500 and 1,700 students in its ranks. 
  Sources in the Burmese opposition in Bangkok said the 
arrests 
were aimed at blocking these students from leaving with their 
weapons and teaming up with the remnants of the Burmese 
Communist Party (BCP). 
  The BCP disbanded in 1989 after an internal squabble.

<F P=106> [Address by Lieutenant General Myo Nyunt, chairman of the </F>
National Convention Convening Commission, to the National 
Convention Plenary Session at Rangoon's President House compound 
on 18 January -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts][passage omitted] National Convention delegates: 
Let us review the current situation. The current situation is 
very delicate as SLORC is striving to achieve national unity. 
It will not be necessary to elaborate on the achievements of 
SLORC during its term of office in improving national security, 
economic, social affairs, education, health, preservation of 
national culture, border region development, and infrastructure 
improvement nationwide. On the political front, there is 
special success in regard to national unity. 
  There is peace and security in areas where insurgency 
prevailed for over 45 years since independence. Most of the 
country's territory is now peaceful and tranquil and we still 
have to strive to bring about peace and tranquility to the 
remaining areas, sooner or later. It is now the time for all 
our fraternal national people to work hand in hand to ensure our 
country, which we love and cherish, is fully peaceful and 
becomes a developed and modern nation. Currently, we are giving 
priority to bringing about the highest level of national unity. 
Therefore, I urge all national people, including the delegates 
and organizations, to have genuine goodwill and to put the 
interests of the nation ahead of one's own and one's group. 
  The delegates at the National Convention had discussed and 
presented suggestions to obtain basic principles on which the 
fundamental principles of the state should be based in drafting 
the State Constitution. The delegates still have to hold 
discussions on details of the basic principles for each chapter 
to fully implement these basic principles. There may be 
differences of opinion or identical opinions on holding 
discussions and consultations. It is important not to be 
dissatisfied when opinions are not the same. It is important 
that one's view and that of others serve the interests of the 
nation and that it is viable. Only the views and methods which 
serve the basic interests of the national people at the highest 
level in the most practical way is desirable. 
  Presently, various indigenous people are living together in 
our nation. As the indigenous people become more aware and 
developed, they have an increasing desire to manage their 
regions themselves. Therefore, we should be magnanimous in 
helping the indigenous people, as that is in accordance with the 
prescribed basic principles, to get the right to the management 
they deserve. [passage omitted] 
  It is important that the structure of the state upholds the 
three cardinal causes [nondisintegration of the Union, 
nondisintegration of national unity, and the perpetuation of 
national sovereignty] as its essence. It is important to strive 
to further strengthen the Union. It is important for parts of 
the Union -- divisions, major regions, and states -- to jointly 
strive for the perpetuation of the Union; a prestigious place 
for the country in the community of nations; and the emergence 
of a modern, developed, and strong nation. It is especially 
important for parts of the Union to strive to ensure the 
interests of the Union are not violated and to contribute its 
welfare. 
  The basic principles for the chapter on the head of state is 
to be discussed at the National Convention. The basic 
principles with the president as the head of state and the 
system of administration with the president as the chief 
executive have been obtained. Details concerning the 
qualifications of the president, who elects the president, and 
the president's rights and responsibilities are to be discussed 
at the convention. 
  In considering the special needs of the state administrative 
system, it should be noted that the world communications and 
transportation are not like before; they are developing fast. 
The international political, economic, social, and military 
situation is changing every moment. Taking these changes into 
account, it has become necessary to have a fast and effective 
administrative machinery. The future system of administration 
must be modern and effective to safeguard the interests of the 
nation, to ensure the perpetuation of national sovereignty, the 
defense of the country's land, air, and maritime territory, and 
the prevention of violations against the country's prestige and 
interests. 
  Our delegates from the Defense Services will take on the 
responsibility we deserve and give our assistance to the best of 
our ability in electing the president. This is to ensure the 
administrative system with the president as chief executive is 
fast and effective and meets the nation's defense requirement in 
the fast changing international situation. It has become 
necessary to give such assistance because we want to defend the 
country in a timely manner, in today's fast changing 
international situation that has repercussions on our nation's 
interests to a certain extent. 
  While I have the opportunity, I would like to speak on the 
third cardinal cause -- the perpetuation of national 
sovereignty, which is crucial to a country. No one should 
attempt to undermine and weaken the country's sovereignty. We 
shall not tolerate the undermining of national sovereignty in 
any way. We shall not tolerate external threats to our national 
sovereignty, and we shall not tolerate threats to our national 
sovereignty from internal minions. Sovereignty, which belongs to 
the people, is the highest [power] and it should be exercised by 
a central body according to constitutional provisions. 
Therefore, it will be necessary for other organizations not to 
infringe upon the rights of the central body. National 
sovereignty belongs to all the indigenous people who have the 
responsibility to respectfully safeguard the sovereignty with 
their lives. 
  National Convention delegates: The environment we are 
currently experiencing provides a very valuable lesson for our 
future journey. The conditions are alerting us to be vigilant. 
Some of those who are opposing national interests are still 
striving to obtain power through a short cut. They are ignoring 
the concrete conditions in the country marked by progress and 
are espousing a pessimistic outlook in making false accusations 
against the state. 
  In accordance with international norms, international 
governmental organizations are not interfering in our internal 
affairs. However, some organizations under the influence of 
imperialists are busy interfering in the internal affairs of 
others and we hear about them daily. It will be irresponsible 
to ignore the threat from this neocolonialist group and those 
opposing national interests. 
  National Convention delegates: The six objectives which we 
should all strive for without fail are: nondisintegration of the 
Union; nondisintegration of national unity; perpetuation of 
national sovereignty; the promotion of genuine multiparty 
democracy; the promotion of Lawkapala [universal] principle of 
justice, liberty, and equality; and the participation of the 
Defense Services in the leading role in future national 
politics. I conclude here by urging the delegates to give good 
suggestions and hold discussions and consultations for the 
emergence of a state constitution which is in accordance with 
these six objectives and contribute to the promotion of the 
essence of the 104 basic principles that we have obtained for 
prescribing the fundamental principles of the state.

  [Excerpt] THAILAND told the United States yesterday that 
by April it would improve its offer for foreign companies to 
gain access to the Thai financial market under the Uruguay Round 
of world trade talks. 
  April is when the Uruguay Round agreements are due to be 
signed formally in Morocco. Thai Finance Minister Tharin 
Nimmanhemin said he told visiting US Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen that the new offer to be submitted in April would 
include allowing foreign brokerages to own up to 49 percent of 
Thai securities companies once these have been separated from 
finance companies. 
  The new foreign ownership rule has already been agreed by 
the 
Cabinet. Its importance in the Uruguay Round deal would be the 
commitment under a new General Agreement on Trade in Services 
not to backtrack. 
  Thailand's previous offer, which also covers banking, 
insurance and other services, did not make the 49 percent 
ownership commitment for securities companies. 
  Other revisions could also be included in the new offer, 
such 
as permission for US banks to set up automatic teller machines 
around the country. But Mr Tharin told reporters yesterday that 
this would have to be considered before a commitment is made. 
  Mr Tharin stressed yesterday that the discussions with Mr 
Bentsen were under the multilateral umbrella of the Uruguay 
Round and were not bilateral. 
  The question of financial services liberalisation was one of 
four major topics discussed when Mr Bentsen met Prime Minister 
Chuan Likphai, Mr Tharin and Bank of Thailand Governor Wichit 
Suphinit yesterday. 
  The other three were a request from Mr Bentsen for ideas on 
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group's finance 
ministers meeting in Hawaii in March, bilateral negotiations on 
a double taxation treaty, and a US request for Thailand to enact 
a law against money laundering -- the latter a less 
controversial issue according to Thai ministers. 
  In the morning he visited the Stock Exchange of Thailand, 
but 
SET president Seri Chintanaseri said the question of access to 
the Thai market for foreign stock brokers was not raised.

  [Text] FINANCE Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin told US 
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen yesterday that Thailand will 
improve its financial market access, but this does not mean that 
foreign brokers will have full freedom to enter the country. 
  Not, that is, unless the law is revised so that the 49 
percent limit on foreign ownership of securities firms is lifted. 
  Some Thai brokers point out that even Thai companies face 
restrictions in share trading because of limits on licences 
issued for stock market members. 
  Sa-ngad Sataphattana, Baring Research's director, does not 
see full broker status for foreign companies in the next couple 
of years because, not only foreign firms, but also securities 
companies in the country cannot easily get brokerage licences. 
  There are 40 full brokers in Thailand, while a bigger number 
are subbrokers which have been coveted to gain broker status. 
[as published] 
  The Stock Exchange of Thailand [SET] recently announced that 
it would grant another four broker licences to sub-brokers. The 
new brokers will be chosen from sub-brokers which have a good 
track record. 
  "Whether or not the securities business will be opened to 
foreign countries depends on the readiness of securities houses 
in Thailand and the securities market size of the country," said 
Mr Sa-ngad. 
  He added that few local brokers were in a position to 
compete 
with foreign firms. The development of the Thai capital market 
is not sufficient to cope with the entry of foreign securities 
firms. 
  "Thailand has only one secondary market for stock trading. 
An over-the-counter market has not been established yet. Debt 
instruments, which lack liquidity, are at the fledgling stage," 
said Mr Sa-ngad. 
  He said US securities firms did not have a commitment in 
Thailand's market. The demand by the US Treasury Secretary for 
the liberalisation of the securities business is only aimed at 
paving the way for the entry of US firms in the future. 
  "The US securities business in Thailand is tiny when 
compared 
to that of European countries. Normally, US securities firms 
will send a team to handle big underwriting deals in Thailand, 
such as the recent underwriting of Bangkok Bank's debt 
instruments by Morgan Stanley," said Mr Sa-ngad. 
  Seri Chintanaseri, the Stock Exchange of Thailand's 
president, who met with Mr Bentsen yesterday morning, said the 
US Treasury Secretary did not discuss anything about the 
possibility of foreign firms operating securities businesses in 
Thailand. 
  Mr Seri said Mr Bentsen just wanted information about the 
SET 
index, listed companies and member companies of the SET and its 
computer trading system. 
  Whether or not local securities firms are ready to compete 
with foreign companies, Mr Seri said, is a matter for the 
Government to decide in consultation with the SET. He said the 
liberalisation of the securities industry would have to be 
harmonised with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
  Rapi Sucharitkun, the Securities and Exchange Commission's 
spokesman, said Thailand had to revise regulations to liberalise 
the securities industry. 
  "The maximum limit on foreign holdings in securities firm in 
Thailand is 49 percent. The limit has to be boosted to enable 
foreigners to be major shareholders before seeking broker 
seats," noted Mr Rapi who added that this would take a long time. 
  A source at the Finance Ministry said the ministry was 
studying ways to liberalise the country's financial industry, 
including the securities business. 
  "The possibility of securities liberalisation is still far 
away. But the US may apply pressure to liberalise financial 
services at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation group, which 
will have a (finance ministers') meeting in March," said the 
source who added that most ASEAN countries did not want to open 
their financial markets to the US.

  [Text] The blockage of the Tokyo Bay by a U.S. fleet under 
the command of Commondore Perry to force Japan to open its 
market was the first chapter of Japan's modern history. Now the 
United States is sending Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen to 
visit China, Indonesia, and Thailand with a specific mission of 
prying open their markets for the major U.S. service sectors so 
that they can earn money freely in this region. The treasury 
secretary's maneuvers are being closely observed and many wonder 
if Bentsen is the second Commondore Perry. 
  As Thailand is one of the three targets of his mission, 
Bentsen is determined to unlock the services market, 
particularly the capital and financial market which involves the 
operation of commercial banks, stock brokerage firms, and 
insurance companies. Besides civil aviation, he will discuss 
with Thai officials ways to solve the double taxation problem 
left unsettled on the negotiating table for two decades and ask 
Thailand to pass a law dealing with money laundering. 
  We believe that what the United States wants most is the 
opening of the Thai financial market, probably the part 
involving banking services and stock trading. Statistics shows 
that the total value of the stock trade value last year was over 
2.053 trillion baht, an average of 8.597 billion baht per day. 
Trading by foreign investors amounted to 581.869 billion baht 
or 14.10 percent. Since late last year, more U.S. capital has 
been flowing into the stock market. Therefore, the United States 
must try to play a role as large as possible in the Thai 
financial sector. 
  We want the officials concerned to think thoroughly and 
avoid 
yielding to all Bentsen's demands because that could lead to the 
collapse of Thai commercial banks and brokerage firms, not 
because the U.S. banks and brokerage firms have more expertise 
in this field. If we open our market for the United States, we 
will have to do the same with all other countries. Hence, we 
will have to face strong competition with banks from other major 
financial powers like Japan, the European countries, Australia, 
and Canada. 
  Liberalization of our financial market is a good thing. But 
if it means the death of Thai businesses, we must avoid it 
altogether or try to do it gradually. We want to remind 
everyone concerned that the United States has clearly announced 
that its financial market will remained closed until next 
September, even after the new GATT rule takes effect. In other 
words, the United States has said frankly that it will not open 
its financial market. Thailand can at least cite this as an 
excuse for doing the same thing. 
  Thai commercial banks and stock brokerage firms should be 
aware of the fact that we can no longer block U.S. banks and 
brokerage firms. So, we must prepare ourselves for competition 
through the merger of banking and brokerage services in advance.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA Jan 13 -- Dialogue between nations on 
common issues of the world has the effect of narrowing down 
disagreement while promoting mutual understanding, said Deputy 
Foreign Minister Le Mai on Thursday. 
  This trend is growing in present-day international 
relations, 
he said in an interview granted to VIETNAM NEWS AGENCY. 
  Le Mai said each nation has the responsibility of 
guaranteeing human rights within its territorial boundaries. He 
also acknowledged that human rights were the concern of the 
world community as a whole. 
  He said Vietnam agreed to talk with other countries on human 
rights because it wanted those countries to understand that the 
people of Vietnam had given so much for man's sacred fundamental 
rights on this land, and were making tremendous efforts in all 
fields -- political, economic, cultural and social -- to ensure 
human rights in their country. 
  "We will talk with other countries", Le Mai said, "so that a 
correct understanding can be had on the fundamental principles 
of an international law on human rights, namely respect for 
national independence and national sovereignty, respect for the 
right of nations to self-determination, particularly the right 
for each to choose its own path of development, respect for 
national, community of individual rights, respect for political, 
civil, economic and social right of the citizen and respect for 
the right of nations for development which is now a topical 
problem of the world". [sentence as received] 
  Le Mai dismissed recent press reports about dialogue on 
"certain aspects of human rights in Vietnam". "Vietnam and 
other countries have agreed that their exchanges of views will 
be conducted on the basis of equality, mutual respect and 
non-interference", he stressed. 
  Le Mai said he believed the talks would be positive and 
constructive. "If our interlocutors can say concretely where 
and how our law does not conform strictly to international law 
we will [words indistinct] seriously and refer them to 
Vietnamese competent bodies for consideration". 
  "At the same time we will try to make other countries share 
our views that man's most fundamental rights are national self- 
determination and development, which must be strictly 
respected," Le Mai added. 
  He said he hoped the world community, through dialogue, 
would 
gradually establish mutual respect and [words indistinct] and 
equal, mutually beneficial cooperation on human rights. 
  "Human rights should not be used as a tool for one country 
to 
impose on, or interfere in, another country", Le Mai concluded.

  [Text] The establishment of the Vietnamese-Dutch Trade 
Joint Venture Limited Company has initiated investment 
cooperation in bilateral transport and communications. The 
joint venture is between the Vietnamese Ministry of Transport 
and Communications and the Port and Gas Consortium of the 
Netherlands. 
  The Netherlands is one of the largest investors in Vietnam. 
At present, it has nine projects with total capitalization of 
$227 million, ranking it eighth among 42 countries in investment 
capital. It follows Taiwan, Hong Kong, France, Australia, South 
Korea, Japan, and Britain. 
  Most of the Dutch investment is in oil and gas, light 
industry, and tourism. 
  Speaking to the media in Hanoi on October 12, Dutch 
Transport 
Minister Maij-Weggen said that under the agreement on air 
services signed with Vietnam Airlines, KLM will operate two 
flights weekly from Amsterdam to Ho Chi Minh City and expand 
services to Hanoi. 
  Maij-Weggen said: Developments in Vietnam are taking place 
rapidly. In the next few years, it will be faced with difficult 
choices with which we, in Holland, are all too familiar, 
especially in your densely populated coastal areas. The 
available water is used in many different ways. In densely 
populated areas, for drinking water, for industry, and for 
fishing. On the other hand, water forms an invaluable transport 
artery. [Word indistinct] water management is therefore 
essential in order to allow all of these typical activities. 
Without being immodest, I think I can say that Holland has 
something to offer here. 
  Vietnam is striving to draw more investment capital for 
infrastructure construction, primarily for transportation and 
postal services. 
  By October 1993, the State Committee for Cooperation and 
Investment has granted licenses to 22 transportation and postal 
services projects with total capitalization of $432 million.

<F P=106> [Unattributed essay] </F>
  [Excerpts] Dear friends: Every year when the traditional 
Tet New Year arrives, those who manufacture and trade imitation 
goods pour large amounts of goods into the market to hoodwink 
consumers. 
  Incomplete statistics reveal that 19 large provinces and 
cities in the country have, over the past nine months, 
discovered and taken legal action against the more than 600 
cases involving the manufacture of and trade in imitation goods. 
It is certain that this figure is far below reality. 
  The Hanoi market control sector lately has inspected various 
liquor stalls at the Hang Da Market and on Tran Xuan Soan Street 
near the Duc Vien Market. Initial reports show that seven 
stalls were found selling imitation whisky. Currently, there 
are only small quantities of preserved fruits presently on sale 
for consumption during the Tet New Year. But intense 
preparations are being made by counterfeiters of preserved 
fruits with famous brand names. The places from which 
counterfeit goods are produced are located mainly in suburban 
blind alleys or in provinces adjacent to Hanoi. An example is 
the case where the Ba Dinh Precinct Security Police captured 
red-handed Nguyen Van Che of Phu Lo Village in Dong Anh, a 
suburban district of Hanoi, as he -- together with three other 
accomplices -- was canning fake Beer 33. Two thousand 
counterfeit beer cans, 100,000 metal top pieces, and a pressing 
machine were seized on the spot. The offenders testified that 
they had counterfeited and marketed 20,000 cans of Beer 33 over 
the past three months. 
  Last week, Hanoi market control forces arrested three 
counterfeiters in Phuc Tho District of Ha Tay Province and Dinh 
Bang District of Ha Bac Province. The forces seized nearly 
5,000 packs of counterfeit brand name cigarettes. 
  Not long ago, the Vung Tau Customs Office discovered 106 
bales of imported goods. These imports, weighting 4,000 tons, 
were found to be sub-assemblies for wrist watches. The wrapping 
paper shows these products were manufactured in Japan, but an 
inspection of the contents found that they were low-quality 
watch sub-assemblies manufactured in another territory. [passage 
omitted] 
  At present, as many as 50 percent of production 
establishments have not registered their trademarks, qualities, 
and copyrights. [passage omitted] 
  The state currently does not have any policies available to 
encourage market control forces to strive harder to fight 
imitation goods. Funds allocated to this kind of operation are 
still too small. Almost all of the imitation goods confiscated 
should be destroyed or recycled. Moreover, efforts to verify 
imitation goods are facing difficulties because of a lack of 
cooperation among laboratory testing organs, the trade firms 
concerned, and the imitation goods control force. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Bui Thien Ngo, Politburo member and interior </F>
minister, by Hong Vinh; date and place not given] 
  [Text] [Hong] Could you please give an overall evaluation 
of recent important changes in the struggle against corruption 
and smuggling? 
  [Bui] In implementing Directive No. 15 dated 20 November 
1992 
issued by the CPV Central Committee Political Bureau and the 
Decision No. 114 dated 21 November 1992 by the prime minister on 
suppressing and eliminating corruption and smuggling, the 
government has tried to direct the ministries, sectors, and 
localities in carrying out various important measures and has 
achieved significant initial progress. The determination of the 
party and state in radically suppressing corruption and 
smuggling received widespread support from the cadres and 
people. There have been more corruption and smuggling cases 
detected and handled strictly than before. 
  [Hong] But, Dear Minister, our cadres and people still have 
a 
lot to worry about in regard to these problems. 
  [Bui] That is correct. Although the direction has been more 
resolute than before, our achievements were still very limited, 
and in some areas the number of corruption cases even grew. 
Areas of great concern are basic construction, real estate, and 
illegal automobile and motorcycle imports through the ports and 
southwestern borders. These activities occur mainly in major 
economic sectors like trade, construction, communication and 
transportation, marine products, agriculture, and the food 
industry. Many agencies and authorities have allowed individual 
traders to use their power to engage in smuggling activities. 
In the first 10 months of this year, we discovered 918 
corruption cases involving 285 billion dong, 95 percent more in 
terms of the number of cases and 244 percent higher in terms of 
the money involved compared with the same period last year. 
Corruption was detected, not only in economic and business 
agencies, but also in law enforcement agencies or in agencies 
directly charged with preventing and fighting corruption and 
smuggling, such as customs, taxation, public security, 
inspection, courts, and so forth. 
  [Hong] What are typical recent examples of corruption? 
  [Bui] Analyzing the cases detected, we can list some general 
types of corruption activities as follows: 
  Violating laws and regulations relating to budget 
expenditure and income. 
  Abusing joint business ventures by colluding with foreign 
partners to cheat in import-export activities. 
  Violating state regulations on real estate management and 
basic construction. 
  The most serious situation was the popular trend of 
wrong-doing among leading cadres at some ministries, sectors, 
and localities, who only care about their sector's benefit and 
ignore the laws and regulations. They even go beyond their 
authority to set up economic and financial regulations 
themselves, thus assisting corruption and smuggling activities 
and worsening the already complicated situation. 
  [Hong] Dear Minister, what are the noteworthy features of 
the 
struggle against smuggling? 
  [Bui] There was a reduction of smuggling directly involving 
state authorities and economic agencies under social and 
political organizations. The implementation of verification and 
control measures, though still bearing many shortcomings, has 
begun to help the concerned agencies recognize those 
professional smugglers, punish them severely, and repress the 
haughty and challenging attitude of the smugglers towards the 
government. 
  The smuggling situation, however, is still very serious, 
because it has become so complicated and diversified in various 
regions and localities, at different points of time, with some 
hot spots being the southwestern border, the northern border, 
and at sea. These are some emerging issues: 
  violations of lumber export regulations are common 
  smuggling of foreign cigarettes along the west and 
south-west borders is on the rise, even more openly than before 
  automobile smuggling through the southwestern border is 
still serious 
  for items whose importation is prohibited, or whose import 
permits are cancelled temporarily, the smugglers still find ways 
to elude control measures and investigation 
  smuggling at sea has become more complicated 
  Most major smuggling activities (via sea, air, and inland 
routes) involved using state-owned vehicles and ships, by either 
arrangement by the people in charge of the media with the 
smugglers, or the state economic agencies directly carrying out 
the smuggling themselves. The concern is that there has been 
collusion among smugglers, corrupt people, and degenerate cadres 
in the forces directly in charge of smuggling suppression. 
  [Hong] Could the minister please outline the policies and 
measures to suppress corruption and smuggling? 
  [Bui] The report of the government to the fourth session of 
the Ninth National Assembly has outlined the following policies 
and measures: 
  1. Reorganize, adjust, and complete the current system and 
policies relating to the suppression of corruption and smuggling. 
  The government will soon issue documents to distinguish the 
state management authority with production and business 
management functions of ministries and sectors. For the near 
future, the government is going to issue preliminary documents 
on public service regulations, government employee awards, and 
on a number of urgent issues such as regulations on receiving 
gifts and bonuses, expenditure of public fund, and so forth. 
  2. Heighten responsibility of leaders of all agencies in 
fighting corruption and smuggling. 
  3. The law enforcement authorities will concentrate on 
regions and areas where conditions allow smugglers and corrupt 
people to make connections with degenerate cadres, in order to 
fight corruption and smuggling effectively. 
  4. The law enforcement agencies will take up resolute 
measures to consolidate and cleanse the organizations. They 
also have to promote clean and just cadres for this campaign. 
  5. The ministries, sectors, and localities should 
regularly scrutinize the implementation of government decisions 
on anti-corruption and anti-smuggling work. 
  6. Consolidate the ancillary anti-corruption and 
anti-smuggling bodies within ministries, sectors, and 
localities. Determine clearly the responsibility and power of 
these bodies to ensure their effective operation. 
  [Hong] Thank you, Dear Minister.

  [Excerpt] Hanoi VNA Jan. 17 -- The Long Xuyen quadrangle 
covers an area of 500,000 ha, half of them in An Giang Province. 
The land, which was left almost waste for quite a long time, as 
it was subjected to droughts for six months and floods for the 
other six months of a year. A few people settled down in this 
area. Every year they just came in November to harvest floating 
rice which grew naturally during flood seasons. 
  In order to turn that quadrangele into arable lands, the 
province implemented a five-year programme 1988-1992 with the 
total investment capital of 400 billion dong contributed by both 
the central and the local governments. Roads were upgraded, 
canals and ditches dredged and many rural areas supplied with 
electricity. As a result more and more poeple came and settled 
down in the quadrangle, bringing its population to 1.5 million. 
  Farmers began farming double rice crops and got an average 
yield of 9.8 tonnes/ha/year, making An Giang the biggest rice 
producer in the country in 1993 with an output of nearly 2 
million tonnes. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In Ho Chi Minh City recently, the Tank and Armored 
Force [TAF] Command held a seminar on its building and training 
tasks during the past period. General Doan Khue, member of the 
party Central Committee Political Bureau and minister of 
National Defense attended the seminar. 
  The TAF commander delivered a report on the activities of 
the 
force during the past few years. He pointed to its great 
efforts in improving its organization and personnel to meet the 
requirements of localities, military regions, and key strategic 
areas. 
  Despite numerous difficulties in equipment, budget, and 
facilities, the TAF has closely coordinated with the army corps, 
military regions, and localities to build and strengthen its 
units, improve training, and maintain combat readiness. The 
force has also striven to recruit and train new cadres, 
specialized personnel, and workers. Various units of the force 
have consistently improved training and fulfilled all their 
assigned tasks. They have closely combined the task of building 
firm and comprehensively strong units with that of modernizing 
and standardizing the army. 
  The seminar provided ample time for delegates of the army 
corps, military regions, and military units to discuss and 
exchange experiences on training and maintaining the spirit of 
combat readiness, military and joint operations, and other tasks 
related to national defense. 
  Speaking at the seminar, the minister stressed: In building 
and training, the TAF should implement the motto: firmly 
maintain basic principles and effectively apply past combat 
experiences. Cadres of the force must carefully study the 
enemy's capabilities while formulating concrete plans and 
projects to enhance the quality of training at various units. 
They must also strive to fulfill their tasks in order to attain 
standardization, build comprehensively strong units, set up firm 
and strong defense zones, and step by step advance toward 
modernizing the army. These are essential tasks for making the 
TAF units strong and firm so that they can fulfill new tasks and 
meet the requirements under all circumstances for the cause of 
national defense and construction.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 19 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii said Wednesday [19 January] he hopes to meet U.S. Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who is scheduled to stop over in Japan 
on Sunday for refueling on his way back to the United States 
from his tour of Asia. 
  Denying reports that Japan had rejected U.S. requests for 
the 
meeting, Fujii said, "We have not received such a request yet." 
But he said he considered the proposed meeting "positively" and 
he told a press conference he wanted to "take the opportunity" 
to meet Bentsen, indicating that Japan may propose the meeting. 
  Fujii declined to comment on what they might discuss, but 
said he is "not in the position to negotiate" for the Japan-U.S. 
"framework" trade talks in reference to recent U.S. demand to 
meet with officials who can make political decisions instead of 
bureaucrats. 
  Turning to domestic issues, Fujii indicated that the 
government's new economic stimulus package will be launched by 
month-end, but hinted that an income tax cut may not be 
included. The compilation of the package is progressing 
"substantially," and the completion will not be "so far away," 
he said. 
  Considering the tax issue, he said, "it's separate" from the 
package that is now being formed by the Economic Planning Agency 
because the decision is left to a joint economic problem forum 
of the government and the coalition parties. But Fujii noted 
that he wishes tax cuts to be included as an economic measure, 
saying "that's more favorable." 
  Given the package, his ministry will compile a third fiscal 
1993 supplementary budget along with fiscal 1994 budget, he said.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 19 KYODO -- A government advisory panel 
Wednesday [19 January] blasted a U.S. policy seeking numerical 
trade targets as "bid rigging" between exporting and importing 
countries. The policy is designed to guarantee a fixed portion 
of trade profits by imposing import goals in "a compulsory 
manner," said the head of the Industrial Structure Council, an 
advisory body to the minister of international trade and 
industry. 
  The practice would serve nobody's interests in the long run 
because it would eventually erode the competitiveness of 
exporting countries as well, panel chairman Mitsuo Matsushita 
told a press conference. 
  The panel said, "an exporting country should not call on the 
government of an importing country to implement a `numerical 
target-based trade policy.' Nor should the government of an 
importing country accede to such a request." 
  Voluntary plans for U.S.-made auto parts purchased by 
Japanese car makers and U.S. expectations in its chip trade 
accord with Tokyo were "abused" in the past and treated as if 
they were government commitments, which they were not, the panel 
said. 
  Japan must dismantle numerical trade policies already in 
place by "as early a date as possible" while it should ensure 
that the private sector does not take similar measures in the 
future, the panel said. 
  Matsushita, professor at the University of Tokyo, dismissed 
a 
U.S. call for Tokyo's introduction of numerical targets as a way 
to further open up Japan's markets. 
  There is no relationship between market shares and the 
degree 
to which the market is closed, Matsushita said, noting foreign 
shares in a given country are determined by various factors such 
as differences in competitiveness, business efforts by exporters 
and consumer preferences. The United States would contradict 
itself by saying the Japanese chip market is closed because of a 
U.S. chip share in the market of less than 20 percent against 
its 40 percent share in the global market, Matsushita said. 
  Japanese-made chips command a 40 percent global market share 
while their share in the U.S. is only 20 percent, he explained. 
  To oblige a user to buy more than they require is tantamount 
to "abandoning the principles of a market economy," Matsushita 
said. He also said a numerical trade target policy represents a 
"complete disregard of normal selection criteria such as quality 
and prices," noting the policy would result in a "waste of 
taxpayers' money" and "a loss of economic benefits" for them. 
  He said the policy is also "completely" against the 
principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), 
which is aimed at "strict adherence to the rules of 
international trade." Matsushita said preferential treatment of 
certain countries under the policy violates Article I of the 
GATT provision, which calls for most-favored-nation treatment 
among countries.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 19 KYODO -- The United States called 
Wednesday [19 January] for new action to boost the share of 
foreign semiconductors in the Japanese market but Japan rejected 
the request, officials said. Both sides said Tokyo does not 
view as serious recent declines back below the 20 percent goal 
for foreign share of the Japanese microchip market, a level 
reached last year after high-profile talks that prompted 
criticism as managed trade. 
  "We were disappointed," said a U.S. trade official, citing 
Japan's "lack of willingness to take the measures necessary" to 
prevent the microchip issue from reemerging as "a point of 
contention" before a bilateral summit on February 11. 
  A Japanese Trade Ministry official said Tokyo rejected the 
call for new steps because, despite recent share declines, 
foreign access to the Japanese market has steadily expanded and 
efforts in the area were being rewarded. 
  "You don't have to alternate between hope and despair over 
quarterly figures," the Japanese official told reporters, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. But the U.S. official told 
a separate briefing, also on condition his name not be used, 
that last year witnessed "a continuous decline for foreign 
market share." 
  Noting that broad-based bilateral talks that aim at 
agreement 
before the meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and 
Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa include a review of 
existing accords, he said the microchip issue will likely be 
"another problem to be dealt with." 
  But, touching on an area of strong Japanese objections, the 
U.S. official said the specific target-setting used in 
semiconductors "is not necessarily the right approach for all 
products or for all areas we have problems with." He also 
expressed hope that Wednesday's "emergency consultations," which 
Washington requested, will lead Japan to "take a more 
forthcoming and activist approach to the issue." 
  No date was set for further semiconductor talks. 
  The U.S. made no specific proposals but asked Tokyo to craft 
a plan to boost foreign microchip use in autos, 
telecommunications and video games, increase "design-in" 
opportunities and consider reviving some earlier steps, the U.S. 
official said. 
  The U.S. reckons that the foreign share of Japan's microchip 
market fell to 18.1 percent in the quarter through September 
from 19.2 percent in the preceding three months and 19.6 percent 
in the first quarter of 1993. Japan, which includes in its 
calculations "captive" microchips sold by foreign makers to 
their subsidiaries in Japan, says the July-September figure was 
19.7 percent, after 21.6 percent and 21.5 percent, respectively, 
in the previous two quarters.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 19 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
Wednesday [19 January] ended two days of working-level talks on 
government procurement of medical equipment, a priority sector 
of the bilateral trade framework negotiations, without progress, 
government sources said. 
  Japan offered a new concession by lowering a minimum value 
of 
medical equipment to be bought through open tenders to 100,000 
special drawing rights (SDRs), or about 15 million yen, from 
130,000 SDRs, while the U.S. side stood pat on its demand for 
cutting the minimum value to 5,000 SDRs, the sources said. 
  Among other outstanding points was how to revise Japan's 
procurement procedures with a view to improving market access 
for foreign medical technology, they said. 
  U.S. negotiators asked Japan to increase transparency and 
openness of its government procurement market by introducing 
American systems, which Tokyo claimed are not necessarily 
applicable to the Japanese systems, they said. Both sides will 
continue discussing the issue at a subcabinet-level meeting 
scheduled for January 23 and 24 in Washington, which could be 
followed by a working-level meeting, they said. 
  The working-level talks did not take up the matter of 
"objective criteria," which is a main issue on the agenda of the 
subcabinet-level negotiations, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 19 KYODO -- A Japanese proposal to 
invite Australia to a job summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) 
industrialized nations in March is being dropped because of 
strong U.S. opposition, Japanese Government sources reported 
Wednesday [19 January]. Japan wanted to ask Australia to the 
summit as a way to ease criticism from the United States and 
Europe that exports from Asia are responsible for growing 
unemployment in their countries. 
  Washington strongly opposed the proposal, though the reasons 
were not known, the sources said. 
  The summit, to be held in the suburbs of Washington on March 
14 and 15, will be attended by cabinet ministers in charge of 
labor affairs from the G-7 members -- Britain, Canada, France, 
Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. 
  The meeting was originally proposed by Japan in 1991, but 
failed to materialize earlier because of a lukewarm response 
from the administration of then President George Bush. The U.S. 
changed its stance, however, after President Bill Clinton came 
to power, they said. 
  The summit has been scaled down from Clinton's idea of 
gathering of prime ministers and presidents of the G-7 
countries. Employment will also be a major item on the agenda 
at the annual G-7 summit to be held in July in Naples, Italy, 
they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 19 KYODO -- Japan does not intend to 
dispatch Self-Defense Forces (SDF) personnel to the former 
Yugoslavia to join UN peacekeeping operations there, Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said Wednesday [19 January]. 
  The commander of the UN Protection Force in Macedonia 
suggested to a Japanese delegation last week that Japan could 
dispatch SDF personnel to the region to serve as unarmed 
military observers. The mission, which left Japan on January 7 
and returned January 17, investigated possible areas for an 
expanded Japanese contribution to the international peacekeeping 
efforts under way in the former Yugoslavia. 
  Takemura told a news conference that mission head Shunji 
Yanai reported that the commander told him "in a general manner 
of speaking" that "it would be good if he could have (personnel) 
dispatched from Japan." Yanai, director general of the Foreign 
Ministry's foreign policy bureau, reportedly did not immediately 
respond to the request. 
  Takemura said he had instructed Yanai to "respond with 
discretion so as not to cause misunderstanding." 
  Yasushi Akashi, the Japanese national who heads UN 
peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia, also asked the 
mission to send personnel to the UN mission in the region. 
Yanai said Akashi did not specify whether he sought military or 
civilian personnel.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 19 KYODO -- Japan has not yet decided 
whether it is legally possible to send peacekeepers to the 
former Yugoslavia, a senior Foreign Ministry official said 
Wednesday [19 January]. Shunji Yanai, who headed a Japanese 
survey team to the former Yugoslavia, told a press conference 
the ministry has to study various requests made during the 
mission's trip to decide what kind of contributions Japan can 
make. 
  The ministry will then ask for a judgment from the foreign 
minister, the chief cabinet secretary and the prime minister, 
Yanai said, adding that there have not been any "specific 
instructions" from them. 
  Yanai, director general of the ministry's Foreign Policy 
Bureau, said Tokyo has to study the legal aspects of whether it 
is possible to send unarmed military observers to Macedonia as 
requested by the commander of the United Nations Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) in Macedonia last week. Yanai said he did not 
immediately respond when Brig. Gen. Saermark Thomsen [name as 
received] made the request in person. 
  Yanai's remarks followed comments by Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura earlier in the day that Japan does not intend 
to dispatch Self-Defense Forces (SDF) personnel to join U.N. 
peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia. Takemura told 
a press conference he had instructed Yanai to "respond with 
discretion so as not to cause misunderstanding." 
  On Sunday, Yanai said in Budapest after wrapping up his 
nine-day survey mission that it is "worth considering" Thomsen's 
request and that Japan could send peacekeepers to Macedonia if 
the nation agreed to the dispatch since no military conflict has 
broken out there. 
  Japan's law on U.N. peacekeeping cooperation bans any 
deployment of peacekeepers in a nation that rejects them. 
  Yanai explained at Wednesday's press conference that he was 
pressed to present his personal view in Budapest. He also said 
Yasushi Akashi, head of the UNPROFOR, has asked Japan to 
participate in consultations among major countries at the 
UNPROFOR headquarters in Zagreb, Croatia, to discuss problems in 
the region. 
  Akashi reportedly said he wants to set up a consultation 
system because such a system was effective in U.N. Transitional 
Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) activities. In Cambodia, 
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, Indonesia, 
Japan, Australia and ambassadors of other nations in Phnom Penh 
held talks whenever problems occurred, Akashi was quoted as 
saying. 
  Akashi said he wants Japan to participate in the proposed 
consultation system because it is not directly participating in 
UNPROFOR activities and because it is in a position to consult 
on problems of great international interest, according to Yanai. 
  Yanai also said that during his trip, officials of Croatia, 
Slovenia and Macedonia strongly called for strengthening ties 
with Japan at both the government and private sector levels. 
Macedonia also asked for economic assistance and cooperation to 
solve its debt problem, he said. 
  International organizations engaging in humanitarian 
activities in the former Yugoslavia cited the lack of facilities 
to accommodate refugees and also medical and other goods, he 
said. 
  In a related move the same day, Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata 
said Japan has appointed a Foreign Ministry official as 
political officer to assist Akashi, as part of Japan's 
contributions there. Tomiko Ichikawa, assistant director of the 
U.N. Administration Division in the ministry's Foreign Policy 
Bureau, is the first woman among five Japanese political 
officers dispatched in connection with U.N. peacekeeping 
operations.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 15 KYODO -- Japan will assure other 
Asian states at July's security forum for the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) that it will never become a 
major military power, Foreign Ministry sources said Saturday [15 
January]. The sources said Japan will do its best to dispel 
such concern among Asian nations and to gain their confidence. 
  Japan's occupation of many Asian countries before and during 
World War II still keeps ASEAN nations nervous about the 
country's military intentions. 
  Foreign ministers from six ASEAN member countries and their 
dialogue partners agreed at a 1993 session to set up the forum 
to discuss security matters in the region. Representatives from 
18 countries and international organizations will attend the 
forum's first session at the foreign minister level in Bangkok. 
  At the session, Japan will reaffirm the importance of the 
U.S. presence in the region, and brief participants on its 
defense policy in an effort to boost their trust and strengthen 
relations with them as key partners, the sources said. 
  As part of efforts to dispel Asia's concern, Japan will 
explain its policy of continuing to shoulder the costs for U.S. 
forces in Japan, they said. 
  China's military modernization and concerns over North 
Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons are also likely 
to be taken up as topics at the forum. 
  ASEAN links Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, 
Singapore and Thailand. Among the 18 other countries and 
organizations attending the session will be the European Union, 
Japan, Russia and the United States.

  [Text] Osaka, Jan. 17 KYODO -- The Export-Import Bank of 
Japan will make no change in its financial support to Russia 
despite the resignation of the nation's economic reform leader, 
the bank's governor said Monday [17 January]. 
  Mitsuhide Yamaguchi said at a press conference in Osaka that 
the Ex-Im Bank will basically maintain its stance on financial 
aid to Russia despite the resignation of First Deputy Prime 
Minister Yegor Gaydar on Sunday from President Boris Yeltsin's 
government. 
  Yamaguchi made the comment after growing speculation that 
Russian economic reforms may be delayed because of Gaydar's 
resignation. He said, however, that the bank needs to take a 
careful look at the development of Russia's economic policy. 
  Some analysts said Gaydar's resignation may have an adverse 
effect on relations between Russia and international financial 
bodies like the International Monetary Fund.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 17 KYODO -- Japan urged India to join 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) to sweep away 
international concern about its development of nuclear weapons, 
Foreign Ministry officials said Monday [17 January]. Japan made 
the call during bilateral talks in Tokyo on nuclear 
nonproliferation, the second of their kind between the two 
nations, the officials said. 
  Japan is greatly concerned about India's nuclear development 
problem in view of its guidelines on implementing official 
development assistance (ODA), they said. 
  The guidelines require Japan to take into account, when 
extending ODA, the recipient nation's military expenditure and 
development, production, import and export of weapons, missiles 
and mass-destruction weapons. 
  Japan also called on India to accept inspections of certain 
nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) to improve the transparency of its nuclear development 
plans, the officials said. 
  The Indian delegation, pointing out that India's basic 
policy 
is the total abolition of nuclear weapons worldwide, called on 
nuclear power nations to make commitments to abolish nuclear 
weapons by presenting specific schedules, they said. 
  India also told Japan it basically supports the nuclear test 
ban treaty and a treaty to ban production of fissionable 
materials, they said. 
  India will be able to meet Japan's demand to improve 
transparency of its nuclear plans if the treaty to ban 
production of fissionable materials takes effect, the Indian 
delegation was quoted as saying. 
  Also in the talks, Japan pointed out the importance of 
holding multilateral talks to discuss security in Southwest 
Asia, including nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and 
missiles. India told Japan that if such talks are held, it is 
necessary to invite all nations that could influence security in 
Southwest Asia and ensure that all nations shoulder equal 
obligations, the officials said. 
  Touching on India's relations with Pakistan, the Indian 
delegation explained that the ties are still tense despite talks 
between vice foreign ministers of both countries, they said. 
  Japan and India held their first bilateral meeting on 
nuclear 
nonproliferation last March in Delhi. The Japanese and Indian 
delegations agreed to hold a third round of talks this year, the 
officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 19 KYODO -- A major Vietnamese trade 
exposition opened in Tokyo on Wednesday [19 January] with Hanoi 
officials expressing hope for vastly increased exports to Japan 
into the future. 
  "Japan is a very important market for our exports," said 
Duong Ky Anh, a senior official of the Vietnam Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry, which cosponsored the exposition along 
with the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO). Duong said 
he hoped the exposition and other events like it to follow will 
help to vastly increase Vietnam's exports to Japan, the 
country's largest export market. 
  According to Japanese Finance Ministry figures, Vietnam's 
exports to Japan registered 870 million dollars in 1992 compared 
with 196 million dollars in 1988. 
  Duong estimated his country's exports to Japan rocketed up 
to 
1.2 billion dollars in 1993. He expressed hope the figure will 
rise as high as 1.6 billion dollars in 1994. 
  The exposition, supported by both the Japanese and 
Vietnamese 
Governments, is the first of its kind ever held in Japan 
focusing on Vietnamese goods. It lasts until January 27 and 
precedes the holding of a major Japanese industrial product 
trade fair in Hanoi next March. 
  Representatives from 25 Vietnamese companies are exhibiting 
such potential export items as shrimp, coffee, handicrafts, 
furniture and clothing. 
  Duong said Vietnam wants in 1994 to double the amount earned 
last year when mineral fuels, mostly crude oil, made up over 
half of the value of Vietnam's exports to Japan. He said 
Vietnam anticipates increasing the value of marine products 
exported to Japan from the 350 million dollars earned in 1993 to 
500 million dollars in 1994. 
  Exports to Japan of marine products, including frozen 
shrimp, 
fish, and squid, have already almost doubled over 1992. 
  Duong called for more Japanese investment in Vietnam, 
especially in infrastructure. He said there is a particular 
need for equipment from Japan that can be used to improve the 
quality of Vietnamese products for export. 
  The official also said his country must endeavor to attract 
greater numbers of Japanese tourists to earn badly needed hard 
currency. 
  Assessing the "privileges and shortcomings" in Vietnam's 
trade relationship with Japan, Duong said the privileges include 
their relative geographical proximity and their dramatically 
improved political ties. He said the shortcomings include 
problems with the quality of processed Vietnamese products. 
  "To some extent we cannot meet the strict requirements of 
this market," he said. "We have to improve our quality 
drastically, otherwise we cannot enter." 
  Duong pointed to "keen competition" from other countries 
like 
China, Thailand and Indonesia which export similar products.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 18 KYODO -- Japan gave on Tuesday [18 
January] a guarded welcome to Myanmar's [Burma's] resumption of 
its national convention to discuss a new constitution. Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada said Japan wants to closely 
watch the deliberations at the convention, which resumed Tuesday 
after adjournments four times. 
  The Japanese Government hopes that progress will be made in 
the deliberations and that democracy will be achieved as soon as 
possible, he said. 
  Myanmar's military junta, the State Law and Order 
Restoration 
Council (SLORC), has nullified the results of a 1990 election in 
which Nobel prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's National League 
for Democracy won a landslide victory, and has said elections 
will be held after a new constitution is adopted.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 17 KYODO -- Japanese investment in 
Europe dwindled by 24.7 percent to 7.06 billion dollars between 
June 1992 and July 1993 and Europe's share of overall Japanese 
overseas investment has slipped, too, according to a study 
released Monday [17 January]. 
  The report by the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry in 
Japan said that while 22.5 percent of Japanese overseas 
investment in the previous survey period, which covered 14 
months, went to Europe -- including Turkey and the successor 
states to the former Soviet Union -- Europe's share this time 
shrank to 20.7 percent. Europe will remain an important 
investment market, however, the survey forecasts. 
  "The drop in investments is not caused by a declining 
interest (in Europe) or lesser competitive pressure among 
Japanese enterprises, but reflects a certain investment 
saturation and the current economic slump," it said. 
  As in previous years, Britain received the lion's share of 
Japan's European investment, some 2.95 billion dollars, followed 
by the Netherlands with 1.45 billion dollars, Germany with 769 
million dollars, and France with 456 million dollars. 
  Of a total of 538 investments, some 378 or 70.8 percent were 
in the manufacturing industry. Car production ranked top with 
92 investments, followed by the electronics industry with 89 
projects, and the chemical and pharmaceutical industries with 54. 
  Japanese companies concentrate their investment activities 
on 
those sectors where the Europeans hold a substantial market 
share, such as environmental technology, chemicals and 
pharmaceuticals as well as car manufacturing, the survey says. 
  In response to an increasing international pressure on Japan 
to cut its trade surplus, the high yen and stricter regulations 
on local content, Japan's internationalization will continue, 
the survey predicts. 
  "Taking into account that a relatively low 7 percent of 
Japan's production occurs abroad compared with 25 percent for 
the United States, another investment offensive might just be a 
matter of time," it said.

  [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in 
Japanese at 2230 GMT on 15 January, in its regularly-scheduled 
"News 2001" program, carries a 34-minute interview with Yoshiro 
Mori, Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] secretary general, and 
another 34-minute interview with Keigo Ouchi, health and welfare 
minister, on political reform issues. 
  The live interview with the LDP's Mori begins at 2238 GMT. 
When asked about the LDP's attitude toward upper house debates 
on the political reform bills, Mori notes the coalition 
government should accept the LDP's opinions on three major 
points of the reform bills. Mori says: "The first question is 
about the quota and allotment of lower house seats. Under the 
LDP proposal, seats of the lower house should be reduced to 471 
-- 300 for single-seat constituencies and 171 for proportional 
representation constituency... [pauses] Second, the size of the 
proportional representation constituency should also be 
reviewed. If the proportional representation election for the 
lower house is conducted under a single nationwide constituency, 
there will be no difference in style between the upper and lower 
houses. Countries which have the parliamentary cabinet system 
and two houses cannot adopt the same election system in both 
houses. In this regard, we are insisting that each prefecture 
must have a constituency for the proportional representation 
election. And finally, we must provide legal control over 
individual politicians' fund management organizations, which 
have been left untouched. The coalition government says 
individual politicians do not have to receive money in the 
future, and all political donations must be concentrated to 
political parties. That is the ideal situation, and it may be 
possible to enforce the rule on Diet members. However, not all 
local-level politicians belong to specific parties. For 
example, 95 percent of mayors and governors are independent from 
any parties. It is impossible to take all funds from them." 
  In response to a question asking if the LDP will seek a 
positive settlement of the political reform issue through the 
summit meeting between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and LDP 
President Yohei Kono, Mori says: "I have been saying that, if 
the ruling parties really want to enact the bills, they have to 
make proposals acceptable to us." Referring to the previous 
Hosokawa-Kono talks held immediately before the lower house's 
approval of the political reform bills, Mori questions 
Hosokawa's leadership in the coalition parties, saying: "During 
the previous meeting with the president, he made no compromise 
on major points of the bills. It may be very rude to say this, 
but it is questionable if he had decisionmaking authority. I 
think he had no decision at that time." 
  The moderator asks Mori about the possibility of another 
political regrouping this year, and Mori says he thinks there is 
a "fifty-fifty" chance. 
  Following Mori, Ouchi, Health and Welfare Minister who 
concurrently serves as chairman of the Democratic Socialist 
Party [DSP], begins to speak at 2313 GMT. 
  Asked if the coalition government is seeking the enactment 
of 
the political reform bills during the ongoing extraordinary Diet 
session without further revision, Ouchi says: "Generally 
speaking, that is true. If the bills are revised further in the 
upper house, they will again be placed under discussions in the 
lower house. Probably, we will not have time to do so. Under 
such circumstances, we are planning to enact the bills without 
further revision as a stopgap measure, and to discuss necessary 
revisions at the next ordinary Diet session. However, I 
personally have some questions about the appropriateness of such 
a methodology." 
  In reply to a question on the DSP's future partner when the 
political regrouping takes place again, Ouchi says: "We will 
join forces with democracy-oriented parties or politicians. 
Also, our partners must have the completely same stance as us 
toward policies on Japan's fundamental systems." Regarding the 
possibilities of another political regrouping, Ouchi says "I am 
over 80 percent certain."

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 19 KYODO -- The ruling coalition and 
the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) began talks 
Wednesday [19 January] to try to strike a deal on the final 
shape of political reform. The discussion came after leaders in 
the House of Councillors from both sides agreed in a preliminary 
meeting that they will negotiate on possible amendments to 
government-sponsored political reform bills. 
  Juro Saito, chairman of LDP members in the upper house, told 
reporters that the coalition and the LDP agreed to search for a 
compromise in the upper chamber rather than through a proposed 
summit between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and LDP 
President Yohei Kono. 
  The government bills, aimed at weeding out rampant political 
corruption, cleared the House of Representatives in mid-November. 
  Upper house debate on the package, which features changes to 
the electoral system for the lower house and tighter curbs on 
campaign funding, is to be concluded on Wednesday, paving the 
way for a vote by an upper house panel and a final vote at a 
plenary session of the upper chamber. 
  Representatives of the coalition and the LDP in the upper 
house are discussing the LDP's compromise proposals, one of 
which calls for a change to the balance between single-seat 
districts and the proportional representation system for lower 
house elections. 
  On the possibility of a summit between Hosokawa and Kono, 
Saito said only, "it depends on developments in our talks." 
  Hosokawa has staked his political future on enactment of 
necessary reform legislation in the current Diet session, which 
ends January 29.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 19 KYODO -- The eleventh-hour talks 
between the ruling coalition and No. 1 opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) went on and off Wednesday [19 January] to 
strike a compromise over LDP demands to modify a 
government-proposed political reform package, legislators said. 
The bargaining continued among Juro Saito, chief of the LDP's 
House of Councillors members, Manso Hamamoto, Saito's Social 
Democratic Party counterpart, and Hiroshi Tsuruoka, his Komeito 
[Clean Government Party] counterpart, they said. 
  The package of four bills are designed to completely 
redesign 
the mechanism of electing members of the House of 
Representatives of the two-chamber Diet, while unifying 
politicians' funds-raising channels into the coffer of a 
political party. 
  So far, the three have failed to reconcile a gulf between 
the 
two camps over the three demands, including the one calling for 
a raise from 274 to 280 the number of lower chamber seats to be 
contested at single-seat constituencies in an LDP-proposed, 
500-seat chamber, they said. 
  Coalition officials said Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
will seek to alleviate the remaining differences in a summit 
talk with LDP President Yohei Kono in a bid to secure the 
parliamentary passage of the package. The package cleared the 
lower chamber's plenary session on November 18. 
  The second of the three demands calls for splitting up the 
single nationwide electorate for the proportional representation 
portion of the 500-seat chamber into several regional blocs. 
  The third calls for authorizing businesses to donate up to 
240,000 yen annually to the two funds-raising organizations of 
individual politicians, while pegging the number of such 
organizations at two for a politician. 
  This compares with the government-proposed bill that would 
place a ban on donations to individual politicians, while 
obligating would-be corporate donors to donate to the coffer of 
each political party, which would be entrusted with distributing 
the money to party members. 
  Meanwhile, the two camps hammered out a few accords to 
effect 
minor modifications of the package, the party officials said. 
One such modification calls for softening a proposed legal 
requirement that only political parties that mustered more than 
3 percent of valid votes cast in the most recent general 
election or upper house election be recognized as a legitimate 
party. 
  The accord lowered the threshold of qualifications of a 
party 
to 2 percent, they said. Unless a party met the requirement, 
the package would not qualify it to receive a government subsidy 
to finance its activities to be appropriated out of a proposed 
30.9 billion yen fund. 
  The coalition and opposition camps are likely to end up 
accepting compromise proposals to create a 510-member lower 
chamber, at which 280 seats would come from single-seat 
districts and the remaining 230 seats be appropriated by 
proportional representation, Diet sources said. 
  The two camps are also likely to accept another compromise 
to 
authorize the legislators of prefectural and city assemblies to 
accept donations in person from businesses, while keeping a ban 
on acceptance of donations by Diet members except for by way of 
a party coffer, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 19 KYODO -- The ruling coalition and 
the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party failed Wednesday 
[19 January] to narrow differences over the government's 
political reform bills. 
  The coalition was poised Wednesday night to vote on the 
package at the House of Councillors Special Committee on 
Political Reform. 
  LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori said his party will not 
resume talks with the coalition Wednesday over possible 
revisions of the package. 
  Eleventh-hour talks between the coalition and LDP took place 
earlier in the day in an attempt to compromise on LDP demands to 
modify the bills. The talks involved Juro Saito, chief of the 
LDP's House of Councillors members, Manso Hamamoto, Saito's 
Social Democratic Party counterpart, and Hiroshi Tsuruoka, his 
Komeito [Clean Government Party] counterpart. 
  The government package cleared the lower chamber on November 
18. 
  The coalition holds a slim majority in the upper house. Some 
dissent in the Social Democratic Party, the largest force in the 
coalition, and the LDP have made the passage of the package 
unclear. 
  Hosokawa has staked the fate of his six-month administration 
on the passage of the package during the current Diet session, 
which ends on January 29.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 19 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa indirectly acknowledged Wednesday [19 January] that a 
large portion of the 100 million yen payment in 1982 which he 
claims was a loan from the scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin 
trucking firm was to secure his election funds for a Kumamoto 
gubernatorial election one year later. Hosokawa made the 
remarks at a meeting of the House of Councillors Special 
Committee on Political Reform. 
  Responding to a question from Liberal Democratic Party 
member 
Minao Hattori about 77 million yen of the 100 million yen from 
Sagawa Kyubin, Hosokawa said the money "was not directly for 
election," but that he "had to secure my own assets to prepare 
for the gubernatorial election." 
  On the use of the 77 million yen, Hosokawa had said he used 
the money to purchase a condominium in central Tokyo. As for 
the remaining 23 million yen, the premier has said he used the 
money to repair the front gate and wall of his residence in 
Kumamoto, western Japan. 
  Hosokawa has said he repaid the loan by January 31, 1991, 
using part of his retirement allowance, after stepping down as 
governor of Kumamoto, in addition to using the proceeds from the 
sale of a plot of land in Tokyo. 
  Hosokawa served as governor of Kumamoto Prefecture for two 
consecutive terms from 1983 until February 1991. 
  Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, one of the Sagawa Kyubin Group firms, 
was the central firm in the 1992 money-and-mob scandal. Former 
kingpin Shin Kanemaru was forced to resign from politics after 
admitting he had received 500 million yen in undeclared 
donations from the firm.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 19 KYODO -- Prices of popular brands of 
domestic rice sold from outlets outside government control have 
been rising as retailers are stepping up purchasing such rice, 
industry sources said Wednesday [19 January]. 
  The retailers have begun actively buying popular brand rice, 
fearing imported rice, which will be on sale in March, will have 
more low-quality Thailand-made long-grain rice as medium- and 
short-grain rice imports from China will be reduced due to bad 
crop. 
  The price of Koshihikari, the most popular brand of rice 
harvested in Niigata Prefecture, for instance, has been renewing 
its record high. It is traded at near 40,000 yen per 60 
kilogram in a free market. 
  The government has decided to import more than one million 
tons of foreign rice to make up for a shortage in supplies 
caused by last year's poor harvest, the worst during the postwar 
period. 
  The Food Agency told rice retailers that 30 percent of 
imported rice to be on sale from March to June will be Thai 
long-grain rice. 
  The prices of Koshihikari harvested in Ibaraki Prefecture 
and 
Akitakomachi of Akita Prefecture were 36,000-37,500 yen 
Wednesday, up 3,000-4,000 yen from the previous week.

  [Text] Nagoya, Jan. 17 KYODO -- The president of Nissan 
Motor Co. indicated Monday [17 January] that the major automaker 
may keep the wage scale of its workers this spring unchanged, 
although he ruled out a possible wage cut. 
  Yoshifumi Tsuji told a news conference in Nagoya that the 
company has no intention of cutting wages, but freezing the wage 
scale is one option. 
  Tsuji added that the company has no plan to review the 
present system for negotiating summer and year-end bonuses in a 
package. It will continue production cuts in the early part of 
fiscal 1994, starting April 1, as it is doing in the latter half 
of fiscal 1993. 
  His remark indicated that the company will give five to 
eight 
extra days off to workers during the April-September period.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "The Traitor's Shirking of </F>
Responsibility"] 
  [Text] According to a report, puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam, 
at a meeting of receiving reports on the so-called work plans 
for this year on 13 January, babbled that industrial peace 
should be maintained and an atmosphere for restraining wage 
hikes should be made to prevail this year, thus pretending that 
this would be measures to win in international competition. 
  This is a cunning, shameless tactic which only the traitor 
turning away from the people, a filthy flunkyist nation-seller, 
can mention. As everyone knows, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique 
promised the U.S. masters toward the end of last year to totally 
open the South Korean rice market. At the Uruguay Round 
negotiation as well, the clique agreed to all the demand for 
opening markets. 
  The grave consequences of the nation-selling treachery which 
the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique committed, including the 
opening of the rice market, will come not only in rupturing the 
South Korean agriculture and leading the 6 million peasants to 
destruction. It will seriously affect other sectors of the 
economy as well, bringing about catastrophic results. 
  The Daewoo Economic Institute said that with the settlement 
of the Uruguay Round negotiation, the small and medium 
industries, whose competitiveness is fragile, could go bankrupt, 
and that unemployment will become a major social problem. The 
Samsung Economic Institute also predicted that imports will 
increase in such areas as foodstuff, textile, and machinery, 
bringing about grave consequences. These economic institutes 
had good reason to make such predictions. 
  The market opening will thus lead the South Korean economy 
to 
irreversible catastrophe, increasing unemployment and leading 
the lives of workers to further destitution. Traitor Kim 
Yong-sam raved about the maintenance of industrial peace and 
restraining wage hike as if they were some effective measures to 
win in international competition. However, it is impossible for 
the South Korean economy to win international competition, for 
the South Korean economy has nothing of its own worth mentioning 
but consists of the vulnerable colonial subjugated economy in 
which it can carry on only such a thing as bonded processing 
trade with others' capital, technology, facilities, and 
materials. 
  The puppets are raving about international competitiveness 
only to shirk responsibility for the catastrophic crisis that 
will result from opening markets. The Kim Yong-sam clique raved 
about maintenance of industrial peace and restraining wage hikes 
with a sinister purpose of forcing obedience and sacrifice upon 
the workers and further stepping up suppression of the labor 
movement so as to stabilize its power. The puppet traitor on 
that day stressed the need to persuade the labor unions of the 
major business groups, which lead the labor movement for wage 
hikes. Before this, he stressed the need for the relevant 
departments to actively cooperate for the settlement of 
industrial peace. He also said that although the workers' 
strike is not against the law, he will have the right of 
emergency coordination exercised. All this proves his said 
sinister purpose. 
  Traitor Kim Yong-sam is a rare fascist tyrant who does not 
hesitate anything if it serves to fill his personal greed for 
power. He is a politico, a filthy impostor who habitually 
deceives and mocks the people. He disguises himself under the 
mask of a civilian regime and pretend to do something for the 
people, but he is a more cunning and shameless person than his 
predecessor military dictators. 
  It is expected that the workers will wage a more vigorous 
struggle in South Korea this year resisting the puppets' 
flunkyist nation-selling economic policy and antipeople labor 
policy. Fearing this, the puppets are attempting to prevent 
their struggle by means of temptation, coercion, appeasement, 
and deception. This, however, will not work. The South Korean 
workers will not move off from the struggle out of fear of 
suppression. 
  The criminal will be punished according to the crime he 
committed. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, which is habitually 
engaged in nation-selling treachery and suppression of the 
people, turning away from the country and the nation, will 
certainly be subjected to the people's stern judgment.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "Challenge to the Aspiration </F>
for Reunification"] 
  [Text] The Kim Yong-sam ring's fascist oppression maneuvers 
become more vicious as the days go by. 
  According to Seoul radio, on 17 January the Seoul Police 
Administration arrested Ho Hyon-chun, a senior at the Chonbuk 
University, who was involved in the August 1993 Pan-National 
Rally as vice chairman of the South side's Headquarters of the 
National Alliance of Youth and Students for the Country's 
Reunification [Pomchonghangnyon], and took him into custody on 
charges of violating the National Security Law. 
  Student Ho Hyon-chun was wanted by the puppet police on the 
charge of attempting to make a telephone call to a 
representative of the Korean Student Council of the northern 
half of the Republic, who was in Beijing, China, during the 
inauguration ceremony of the Korea Federation of University 
Student Councils held at the Koryo University last 28 May. 
  The puppet police arrested the vice chairman of the South 
side's Pomchonghangnyon Headquarters at a time when the 
aspiration for the fatherland's reunification has been 
increasing among fellow countrymen in the North, the South, and 
overseas since the beginning of the new year. This is a vicious 
challenge to the fellow countrymen's aspiration for 
reunification as well as an open fascist oppression of South 
Korean youth and students' rightful struggle for the 
fatherland's reunification and has caused a burning national 
indignation. 
  As everyone knows, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song 
taught in his historical New Year's address that all Korean 
compatriots in the North, the South, and overseas should open a 
new phase of the fatherland's reunification this year by 
carrying out a nationwide struggle, united in one under the 
banner of the great unity of the whole nation. 
  Greatly encouraged by the great leader's New Year's address, 
the people in the northern half of the Republic have been 
vigorously carrying out the struggle for socialist construction 
and for the fatherland's reunification since the beginning of 
the new year. The South Korean people and overseas compatriots 
are also actively struggling to achieve the reunification in the 
nineties, with a new aspiration for the fatherland's 
reunification. 
  Reflecting this trend of the time, the South Korean 
Democratic Party leader Yi Ki-taek held a New Year's news 
conference and expressed his concern about the current 
South-North relations and his willingness to visit Pyongyang and 
meet the great leader in order to improve the deadlocked 
South-North relations. Yang Hyong- sop, chairman of the DPRK 
Supreme People's Assembly, supported and welcomed Yi's 
willingness to visit Pyongyang, saying it is a natural 
expression of intense patriotism by a person who is concerned 
about the destiny of the country and the nation. 
  Now is the time for all fellow countrymen in the North, the 
South, and overseas to launch into the struggle to achieve the 
great national unity after overcoming ideological and systemic 
differences. At this time, the South Korean puppets put a South 
Korean student on the wanted list and finally arrested him 
simply because he had attempted a telephone call to the North's 
youth and students. This was like throwing cold water on the 
South Korean students' and people's fervent aspiration for the 
fatherland's reunification, and clearly showed the rascals' real 
nature as the enemy of the reunification and fascist tyrants who 
does not have the slightest will for reunification. 
  If the Kim Yong-sam ring really practiced civilian politics, 
which they have noisily been advertising, how on earth could 
they consider it a crime to attempt a telephone call to the 
North's students for the fatherland's reunification that all 
fellow countrymen earnestly desire and could they impute an 
awful charge of violation of the National Security Law on him. 
  This act can be done only by those who pursue a permanent 
division of the country, not its reunification; and national 
confrontation, not its unity. In fact, the Kim Yong-sam ring 
has not abolished the fascist evil laws and suppressive 
organizations, such as the National Security Law and the Agency 
of National Security Planning, while talking about reform. They 
use them rather rashly to brutally oppress the South Korean 
people's struggle for independence, democracy, and reunification. 
  Their ignorant and cruel fascist oppression maneuver of 
considering it a crime to attempt to make a telephone call to 
youth and students in the northern half of the Republic and of 
punishing it shows that it is impossible for the South Korean 
youth, students, and people to enjoy their democratic freedom, 
to exercise their right to democracy, or even to discuss with 
fellow countrymen over the reunification issue while leaving the 
ring of civilian dictator Kim Yong-sam and the National Security 
Law, a vicious fascist evil law and anti-reunification law, as 
they are. 
  If the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique believes that they can 
break the people's will for reunification by oppressing the 
South Korean students' reunification movement, they are making a 
wrong assumption. 
  The fatherland's reunification is the national task that 
cannot be delayed any further and the South Korean people's 
struggle for it is intensified more than ever. 
  The Kim Yong-sam ring should look straight at the 
development 
of the situation in South Korea, act discreetly, and resign from 
power immediately.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "Fascist Oppressive </F>
Maneuvers Under the Pretext of Eliminating Crime"] 
  [Text] According to a radio report from Seoul, the puppet 
police on 13 January held an expanded meeting attended by 
chiefs of the crime prevention sections of police offices in 
cities and provinces throughout South Korea and formulated a 
so-called detailed plan to prevent crimes in connection with the 
second 180-day cleanup operation. 
  On 12 January, the puppet Ministry of Home Affairs set the 
period from 12 January to 11 July as the second planning period 
to ensure the stabilization of public welfare and ordered the 
police offices in cities and provinces throughout South Korea to 
keep intensive control over violent crimes. 
  During the 13 January meeting, the puppet police decided to 
maintain an emergency duty system by mobilizing 65 percent of 
police forces and, at the same time, decided to crack down on 
crime by conducting surprise operations once every three or five 
days, thus babbling about the so-called perfect crime prevention 
system. 
  Also, they have decided to arrest criminals by establishing 
a 
special task force against four major crimes, such as organized 
violent groups and robbers, and to take strong steps against 
commanding officers in charge of areas where violent crimes take 
place frequently by removing them from their posts, thus 
applying the regional responsibility system. 
  South Korea seems to have taken steps to root out crimes, 
but, actually, it intends to suppress more brutally the just 
struggles of South Korean youth, students, and people who aspire 
for independence, democracy, and reunification under the pretext 
of rooting out crime. This has been clearly proven in the 
180-day operation to root out crime, which the puppet Kim 
Yong-sam clique started last year after he took office. 
  The Kim Yong-sam clique set the period from 1 April to 
September 1993 as the 180-day operation period to cleanup crime 
and oppress the people, thus loudly talking about the operation 
as if it would remove crime from South Korea. 
  The rate of crime has not decreased, but rather further 
increased. Also, more vicious methods have been employed in 
crime. 
  The South Korean paper TONG-A ILBO reported some time ago 
that murder, rape, robbery with violence, violence, and theft, 
which are called the five major crimes in South Korea, are being 
committed every 125 seconds; fraud, which is called an economic 
crime, every 296 seconds; embezzlement, every 18 minutes and 36 
seconds; and traffic crime every 64 seconds. It also reported 
that robbery and rape cases in South Korea have increased by 500 
times over the past ten years, which is a world record. 
  Despite the Kim Yong-sam ring's raving about crime 
eradication operations, the crime rate has been rising 
continuously in South Korea because they used their suppressive 
force to suppress the people's struggle for independence, 
democracy, and reunification under the pretext of such 
operations. 
  Last year as well, the Kim Yong-sam ring mobilized all their 
suppressive force to suppress the South Korean people's just 
struggle -- such as the struggle calling for the clarification 
of the truth of the Kwangju massacre and the punishment of its 
main culprits, which was waged on the occasion of the 13th 
anniversary of the Kwangju popular uprising,and the meeting to 
launch the Korean Federation of University Student Councils and 
the struggle to realize the 12 June North-South student talks in 
Panmunjom. On 20 July, the Kim Yong-sam ring even exercised the 
right of emergency coordination, which the preceding dictators 
dared not mobilize, and brutally suppressed the labor dispute of 
the Hyundai Motor Company workers. 
  Thus, the Kim Yong-sam ring did not use the police force to 
crack down on crime, but mobilized it to suppress the people's 
just struggle, thus allowing a steady increase of crime in South 
Korea. The crime eradication they rave about is after all an 
excuse to suppress the South Korean people's just struggle. The 
Kim Yong-sam ring has been conducting a 180-day campaign for the 
eradication of crime since early this new year in an attempt to 
block the South Korean people's intensifying struggle for the 
country's reunification and to suppress the South Korean 
students' antigovernment struggle, which will be stepped up this 
spring. 
  Through the Kim Yong-sam ring's fascist terrorist rule for 
nearly one year, the South Korean people have become aware that 
as long as the ring remains in power, it is impossible to 
realize the country's reunification or the democratization and 
independence of South Korean society. They, therefore, are 
launching themselves into the antigovernment struggle against 
the ring. In particular, the traitorous act of the traitor Kim 
Yong-sam, who opened up the rice market, breaking his promise 
not to open up the rice market under any circumstances, is 
causing surging indignation among the South Korean people. 
  At the same time, it is expected that the South Korean 
students and people will further step up their antigovernment 
struggle on the anniversaries of the April popular uprising and 
the Kwangju popular uprising. Hence, the Kim Yong-sam ring set 
aside the period from 12 January to 11 July as a 180-day crime 
eradication campaign period and is frantically engaged in 
fascist suppression of the people. 
  However, fascist suppression cannot be a measure for their 
survival. Rather, it will hasten their own ruin. The Kim 
Yong-sam ring, which claimed to be a civilian regime, is walking 
along the way of fascist suppression in open cooperation with 
his predecessor military fascist dictators. This is a 
last-ditch effort of one who is destined to meet with his doomed 
end. The Kim Yong-sam ring should squarely see the developments 
in South Korea, act with discretion, and step down from power 
without delay as demanded by the people.

<F P=106> ["`Civilian' Regime Not Different From Successive Military </F>
Dictatorial Regimes"-- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 18 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam 
regime which was born of the military dictatorship of the "Sixth 
Republic" under the "civilian" veil in February last year has 
loudly trumpeted about "changes" and "reforms" for nearly one 
year. But it is not different at all from the successive 
military dictatorial regimes. 
  NODONG SINMUN says this in an article today. 
  The author of the article goes on: 
  The Kim Yong-sam group has committed crimes, selling off the 
national dignity and interests further to outside forces, far 
from defending the dignity of the nation and exercising its 
sovereignty. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam allowed the United States to freely 
use the South Korean port facilities "in case of emergency" 
under the "war time host nation support agreement" and he let 
the U.S. Seventh Airforce use most of the U.S. Airforce setups 
which had been to be returned to South Korea. 
  It is the Kim Yong-sam group that begged for a permanent 
presence of the U.S. Forces in South Korea, at the "summit 
talks" and "annual Security Consultative Meeting" with the U.S. 
master [as received] flatteringly promising to the U.S. master 
to increase the annual burden share of South Korea for the 
maintenance of the U.S. Forces to more than three billion 
dollars, and got the U.S. troop cutback shelved. And it is 
again the Kim Yong-sam traitor clique which totally opened the 
South Korean rice market to the United States at the expense of 
the farmers. The Kim Yong-sam clique renounced the claim for 
the liquidation of the colonial past by the Japanese 
imperialists and their compensation to the "comfort women for 
the Army" and unilaterally declared economic opening to Japan, 
thus flinging open the door to the Japanese reactionaries who 
are pushing forward a military power building and nuclear 
armament and seeking overseas expansion. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group has trampled upon the desire of the 
people for democracy with the bayonet, maintaining the 
anti-democratic fascist dictatorial system. Leaving intact the 
"National Security Law", an anti-democratic fascist law, the 
abolition of which is demanded so strongly by the people and 
keeping such repressive tools as the "Security Planning Board" 
and the "secret affairs command", it is totally blocking the 
movement of popular masses of all walks of life with the "new 
security-oriented rule" which puts the "security-oriented rule" 
of the "Sixth Republic" military dictatorship into the shade. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group claims that the "Democratic Liberal 
Party", as the ruling party, is leading "changes and reforms" in 
the van. But it is a small group of privileged men propping up 
the colonial fascist dictatorship in South Korea. 
  "Civilian" fascist dictatorship little different from the 
successive military dictatorship has been established in South 
Korea today. 
  In the "unification policy" the Kim Yong-sam group, just as 
the successive military dictators did, is trampling underfoot 
the desire of the people for reunification and pursuing 
North-South confrontation, not national unity. 
  Turning down the magnanimous proposals of the North, it 
completely stopped the dialogues and cooperation between 
authorities of the North and the South, which had been kept 
going even under the dictatorship of the "Fifth Republic" and 
"Sixth Republic," under the pretext of "suspicion of nuclear 
development by the North". Moreover it committed crimes against 
reunification by blocking at the point of the bayonet 
North-South student talks and the fourth pan-national rally in 
Seoul, which were being promoted at the civilian level. It has 
frequently staged large military exercises against the North in 
league with foreign forces and is leading the North-South 
relations to the dangerous brink of war under the pretext of the 
"nuclear issue" of the North, crying for "a military 
countermove" and "an international cooperation system". 
  As a result, after Kim Yong-sam the traitor took office, the 
national independence has been further violated, with the 
humiliating policy of depending on outside forces stepped up, 
and the democratic civil rights of the people have been stamped 
out, with "civilian" fascistization stepped up, and the desire 
of the people for reunification has been trampled upon with the 
intensification of North- South confrontation. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam must act with discretion, clearly 
knowing that it is not a means of prolonging his days to resort 
to fascist repression and treacheries under the false "civilian" 
slogan.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Warmongers Who Are Only Pursuing </F>
Confrontation and War"] 
  [Text] The puppet Kim Yong-sam clique, which had noisily 
said it would practice civilian politics, ceaselessly have been 
playing with fire against fellow countrymen with outside forces 
last year, challenging peace and [word indistinct], thus pushing 
the situation of the Korean peninsula onto the brink of war. 
  The resumption of the Team Spirit nuclear fire game, which 
is 
known as the largest-scale joint military exercise in the world, 
was followed by various war exercises in South Korea named 
Ssangyong, Ulchi, Ulchi Focus Lens, Hwarang, and Eagle. This 
turned South Korea into a virtual land of gunsmoke, where the 
roar of guns and smell of gunpowder were ceaseless last year. 
  Under the pretext of the North's nuclear threat, the 
warmongers with war frenzy did not hesitate to even have the 
wild outburst of virtual declaration of war by saying that they 
were prepared to take military countermeasures. 
  Traitor Kim Yong-sam, who had been proud of being in 
civilian 
clothes, unlike the preceding military dictators, visited 
frontline troops at the end of last year, wearing combat attire 
of the puppet Army, and bolstered the war mood of northward 
invasion. This enables everyone to easily guess the level of 
the civilian warmongers' war mania. 
  The puppet Kim Yong-sam clique has extremely aggravated 
North-South relations and pushed the situation of the Korean 
peninsula onto the brink of war by conducting adventurous war 
disturbances with outside forces, ignoring the fellow 
countrymen's peace proposal for achieving national 
reconciliation and unity. This is an intolerable, antinational 
crime. 
  The puppet Kim Yong-sam clique's indiscreet playing with 
fire 
aimed at invoking a fratricidal war did not bring them good 
results. The appearance of those who were mobilized to war 
disturbances staged by the civilian warmonger was pitiful. 
  A helicopter of the puppet Naval Command of Operations 
crashed in Kumsu-myon, Songju County, North Kyongsang Province 
last year, and some 10 puppet soldiers died in vain in this 
accident. 
  Another tragedy occurred in Chungwon County, North 
Chungchong 
Province. An F16 fighter plane of the puppet Air Force exploded 
in mid-air during a war disburbance and fell on a mountain in 
the county. 
  The destiny of those who were frantically engaged in a 
provocation against fellow countrymen in the air faced a 
disastrous end. This reminds us of the maxim that those who 
show mercy to others shall enjoy mercy from others. 
  According to the material presented by the South Korean 
puppet Defense Ministry to the National Assembly last year, many 
puppet soldiers died during war exercises against the North. 
Many soldiers died during the merciless and harsh disciplinary 
training in the South Korean puppet military or committed 
suicide, unable to endure any longer their lives of employed 
soldiers. 
  South Korea's Chungang University gazette carried an 
editorial, which pointed out that the Team Spirit exercise is a 
U.S. war disturbance that has no relation to the national 
interest and that South Korea is in bad shape for willingly 
providing the United States with a place for it. The editorial 
also noted that the meaning of this exercise became clear under 
the situation, in which the right to control operations, a key 
element of sovereignty, has been handed over to the United 
States, and denounced the exercise of pointing guns at fellow 
countrymen, saying such a thing can never happen. 
  The South Korean people have branded the puppet Kim Yong-sam 
clique as a group of civilian warmongers. The puppet Kim 
Yong-sam clique has expressed its plan to continue the nuclear 
war disturbance this year, too. 
  It would be quite absurd, however, if the puppet Kim 
Yong-sam 
clique intends to gain something by staging fire games and 
lighting the fuse of war of northward invasion. The South 
Korean puppets should better act discreetly, being clearly aware 
that the nuclear war disturbance will only result in their own 
ruin.

  [Text] According to a report, the South Korean hardliners 
toward the North and military warmongers have recently babbled 
that if the Team Spirit joint military exercise is suspended 
this year, they will conduct other types of military exercises 
that can easily fill the vacuum. 
  The warmongers also said they would conduct a large-scale 
war 
exercise--a combination of Ulchi and Focus Lens exercises--in 
August, if the Team Spirit joint military exercise is suspended. 
  The puppet clique's remarks--which deteriorate North-South 
relations and aggravate tensions on the Korean peninsula--is a 
clear expression of their criminal attempt to stimulate the 
atmosphere of war instead of peace and to continue to embark 
upon the road of confrontation and war instead of conciliation 
and unity. 
  As is known, during the DPRK-U.S. contacts at the end of 
last 
year, the U.S. side officially expressed its willingness to 
suspend the Team Spirit joint military exercise in an effort to 
eliminate a nuclear threat to us. Therefore, we decided to 
allow the necessary inspections to guarantee the continuity of 
the basic safeguards [sunsu tambo]. As a result, we brought 
about a breakthrough for the progress of the talks. 
  At a time when there are positive prospects for the 
settlement of the nuclear issue, the South Korean puppets are 
viciously maneuvering to conduct a new joint military exercise 
by babbling about other kinds of military exercises. This is a 
shameless plot to apply, by any means, the brakes on the 
progress in the DPRK-U.S. talks and to create a new grave 
obstacle to the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  This shows that the puppets actually do not want the 
fundamental settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula even if they talk about denuclerization and 
preconditions, and that they only pursue division and 
confrontation. 
  With the beginning of the new year, the South Korean puppets 
are showing their intention to pursue arms confrontation, while 
talking about the assumption of the combatant posture and the 
immediate countermeasure posture. Also, the fact that they are 
going to conduct a large-scale war exercise this time clearly 
shows such intention. 
  If another large-scale joint military exercise is conducted 
again in South Korea instead of the Team Spirit joint military 
exercise, this means, indeed, that they would continue to 
conduct the Team Spirit joint military exercise. Even if the 
large-scale joint military exercise had another name, it would 
be, in essence, similar to the Team Spirit joint military 
exercise. Therefore, if they continue the joint military 
exercise like the Team Spirit exercise, the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula will neither be resolved nor the relaxation of 
tension and peace be achieved. Also, they will create more 
dangerous war situations on the Korean peninsula. 
  We are ready for either dialogue or war. If the puppet 
clique provokes a reckless war, we will resolutely counter fire 
with fire [purun pullo tasurilkkosimnida]. The South Korean 
puppets must be clearly aware that aggravating tensions on the 
Korean peninsula, turning them into an acute situation of 
confrontation, will only bring destruction to them. They must 
not act recklessly.

<F P=106> ["Warlikers' Moves for Division and Confrontation" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 19 (KCNA) -- The "hard-liners 
toward the North" and warmaniacs of the military of South Korea 
have reportedly blared these days that "another form of drill 
could be enlarged to fill the gap without difficulty, if the 
`Team Spirit' joint military exercises were suspended this year." 
  They also prattled that they would stage in August this year 
a large-scale war game by integrating two military drills 
codenamed "Ulchi" and "Focus Lens", in case the "Team Spirit" 
was suspended. 
  Those remarks worsening the North-South relations and 
carrying the situation of the Korean peninsula to the extreme 
pitch of strain are an open manifestation of their criminal 
intention to continue to run headlong towards confrontation and 
war, not reconciliation and unity, inciting an atmosphere of 
war, not of peace. 
  The South Korean puppets are making desperate efforts to 
stage another joint war game, crying for "expansion of another 
form of drill", at a time when a positive prospect is in sight 
for the solution of the nuclear problem between the DPRK and the 
United States. This is a sinister move to block the progress of 
DPRK-U.S. talks at any cost and lay another grave obstacle in 
the way of the solution of the nuclear problem on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  If another large-scale joint military drill were staged in 
South Korea to replace the suspended "Team Spirit" it would 
mean, as a matter of fact, its continuation. 
  Should they stage another joint military drill which would 
be 
equal to the "Team Spirit" in essence, though different in 
codename, the nuclear problem could never be solved on the 
Korean peninsula nor detente and peace be expected but a more 
dangerous situation of potential war would prevail. 
  We are ready both for dialogue and for a war. If the puppet 
clique recklessly provoked a war, we would determinedly control 
them with fire. 
  The South Korean puppets must not act rashly, mindful that 
their leading the situation of the peninsula to a phase of 
confrontation will only result in their own destruction.

<F P=106> ["Duet of Anti-Communist Conspirators" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 19 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
accuses the South Korean puppets and the Japanese reactionaries 
of connecting "missing of military secret document" and "export 
of a spectrum analyzer" with the DPRK in a far-fetched way. 
  It was reported in South Korea January 14 that the secret 
affairs command of the puppet Army launched an investigation, 
"assuming that the recently lost military secret document 
might be handed over to the General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan (Chongnyon)." On the same day, reports 
provoking the DPRK and Chongnyon were set afloat in Japan, 
which said the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department was 
suspecting that a Kanagawa Prefecture-based trading company, 
specializing in deals with Pyongyang, exported a spectrum 
analyzer which can be converted to military use so that the 
DPRK may use it for missile development. 
  Commenting on this, an analyst of the paper says: 
  It is not an accidental coincidence that the South Korean 
puppets and the Japanese reactionaries launched a smear campaign 
against the DPRK and Chongnyon. It is another premeditated 
smear campaign they launched in conspiracy to spread a new 
rumour giving rise to an "international suspicion" against the 
DPRK and impair its image. 
  Although the South Korean puppets and the Japanese 
reactionaries talk about "possibility" and "suspicion," there is 
no ground to suspect the DPRK's involvement. 
  The South Korean puppets allege that a military secret 
document which was sent to Cho Sun-hwan, "national assemblyman" 
from the United People's Party, disappeared. The "assemblyman," 
however, said he did not know that such document was sent to him 
from the "Defence Ministry" and nobody told him to return the 
document. Nevertheless, the puppets say they have begun an 
investigation "on the premise that the document may be handed 
over to Chongnyon." How ridiculous they are. 
  The South Korean puppets and the Japanese reactionaries are 
trying to create a new "suspicion" against the DPRK in an 
attempt to attach "credibility" to their hitherto fuss over 
"nuclear threat" and "missile threat," bring their "danger" into 
bolder relief and put a new spoke in the wheel of the third 
round of DPRK-U.S. talks which is now on the order of the day. 
  Lurking behind their anti-communist campaign is also a 
sinister intention to impair the prestige of the dignified DPRK 
in the international arena and stretch suppression to Chongnyon, 
a dependable bulwark of the overseas Koreans movement. 
  They had better refrain from rash acts.

<F P=106> ["`Spectrum Analyzer Export' Case, Sheer Fabrication" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 19 (KCNA) -- The Japanese 
reactionaries are slinging mud at the DPRK over the faked case 
of "export of a spectrum analyzer". 
  They allege that the spectrum analyzer which a trading firm 
in Yokohama exported to the DPRK through a third country may be 
used for the development of a ballistic missile. 
  The Japan Defence Agency expressed "deep concern" over the 
case and the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department made a fuss, 
probing into "suspected" trading firms and manufacturers of 
telecommunication devices. 
  The socalled "export of a spectrum analyzer" is an utterly 
groundless fabrication against the DPRK. 
  It is impossible that the spectrum analyzer, which is used 
for the development of television and other telecommunication 
apparatus, was exported to the DPRK through a third country. 
Still more preposterous is the argument that the DPRK may use 
the device for the development of a ballistic missile. 
  The case faked up by the Japanese reactionaries is a product 
of their chronic habit of fabricating every possible case to 
slander the DPRK. It is a revised version and extension of the 
rumour about "hi-tech leakage" they had spread some time ago. 
  They had spread the rumour that their technology had been 
used for the "development of nuclear weapons" in the DPRK. As 
it turned out to be a false rumour, they have concocted the case 
of "export of a spectrum analyzer" this time. 
  Judging from the fact that the Japanese authorities 
fabricate 
such rumours and cases one after another, it is easy to guess 
that they in actuality do not intend to establish 
good-neighbourly relations with the DPRK, but, on the contrary, 
are intensifying the anti-DPRK campaign, although they call for 
"resumption of DPRK-Japan talks". 
  By inventing the case of "export of a spectrum analyzer," 
they foolishly seek to impair the image of the peace-loving 
DPRK and put "sanctions" and pressure on it through "an 
international cooperation system." 
  Unbiased public opinion is angered at the false case because 
lurking behind it is a criminal intention to step up their 
military power buildup under a faked pretext, stage a comeback 
to Korea and, further, bring Asia under control. 
  The Japanese authorities must look straight at the trend of 
the times and immediately stop their futile anti-DPRK campaign.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 18 (KCNA) -- It is a firm stand 
of China to strengthen and develop the China-Korea friendship 
and no one can change it. China would, as always, do its utmost 
for the development of traditional ties between China and Korea 
and make tireless efforts toward the consolidation and 
development of the exchange and cooperation between the two 
countries in different domains. 
  Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Central Committee of 
the Communist Party of China and president of China, made the 
remarks in a meeting with Hwang Chang-yop, secretary of the 
Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, and his 
entourage in Beijing Monday. 
  Noting that the ties between the two countries of China and 
Korea is different from that between other countries, he said 
the China-Korea friendship was tied with blood and founded and 
fostered by Comrades Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai together with 
Comrade Kim Il-song.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 17 (KCNA) -- World public 
expressed full support to the New Year address of the great 
leader President Kim Il-song. 
  Meetings supporting the New Year address took place in 
Moscow, Russia, and Peru and Denmark. 
  Yuri Vashin, a section chief of the Institute of Oriental 
Studies of the Academy of Sciences of Russia, in his speech at a 
meeting of representatives of Russian public circles said the 
New Year address of respected Comrade Kim Il-song, president of 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, gives scientific and 
philosophical conclusions to all questions and clarifies the 
principled stand of Korea. 
  Noting that the "10-point programme of the great unity of 
the 
whole nation for the reunification of the country" put forward 
by respected Comrade Kim Il-song clarifies the idea of achieving 
Korea's reunification, the greatest national desire of the 
Korean people, in a peaceful way on the basis of the confederacy 
formula, he said there is no other alternative but this. 
  Vasim Rozanov, chief secretary of the Graduates Federation 
of 
Moscow State University of International Affairs said he fully 
supports the policy of peaceful reunification of the country and 
all principles of external policy set forth by Comrade Kim 
Il-song in his New Year address. 
  Victor Platov, vice-chairman of the Central Council of the 
Russian Association of Friendship and Cultural Cooperation with 
the DPRK, charged that the United States has not yet withdrawn 
its nuclear weapons from South Korea. The association will 
thoroughly expose the aggressive design of the United States and 
fully support the socialist construction line of the Korean 
Government, he said. 
  Jorge Raso Arrasco, chairman of the Peruvian National 
Association for the Study of the Chuche Idea, speaking at a 
meeting held in Peru, held that the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula must be settled through DPRK-U.S. talks on the 
principle of impartiality. 
  Anders Kristensen, chairman of the Denmark-DPRK Friendship 
Association, in his speech at a joint meeting held in Denmark, 
stressed the need to more actively conduct movements for 
solidarity with the Korean people.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 15 (KCNA) -- A Pyongyang meeting 
was held at the Grand People's Study House Friday to mark the 
550th anniversary of the creation of Hunminjongum (Korean 
alphabet). 
  The meeting was attended by Yi Chong-ok, Politburo member of 
the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] and 
vice-president, Kim Chung-nin, secretary of the Central 
Committee of the WPK, and officials concerned. 
  The Korean alphabet created on the basis of the Sinji 
letters 
which had been used by Koreans for thousands of years was 
proclaimed in 1444. 
  In his report at the meeting, Vice-premier of the 
Administration Council Chang Chol said the Korean alphabet is a 
set of national letters worthy of praise, which reflect the 
creative wisdom and resourcefulness of the Korean people, and a 
valuable asset and cultural heritage of the nation that holds a 
particular position in the development of written languages of 
the world. 
  Turning to the advantages of the Korean alphabet, Chang Chol 
said it is scientific theoretically and orderly in structure and 
system, it fully reflects the characteristics and richness of 
the sound and easy to learn and write. 
  "With the creation of the Korean alphabet, the Korean people 
came to have a means of writing suited to the national 
characteristics of the mother tongue and a powerful weapon in 
the cause of transforming nature and society," he said. 
  He recalled that during their occupation of Korea in the 
past, the Japanese imperialists forced the Koreans to change 
their names to Japanese style and speak and write in Japanese in 
everyday life in order to obliterate the Korean language and 
letters as well as the Korean nation. 
  "This was the most heinous crime never to be condoned and a 
beastly act without precedent in history," the reporter said. 
  "Under the wise guidance of the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song, darkness and illiteracy were dispelled, the 
anti-popular system of writing demolished and a new system of 
writing based on national independence established, so the 
Korean people, who were far removed from modern civilization, 
have become the true masters and users of the written and spoken 
languages," he said. "The idea and guidance of the great leader 
to develop the national language on the basis of chuche and 
improve it are being successfully carried forward by the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il today." 
  He said the treacherous acts of the Kim Yong-sam puppet 
clique to obliterate the mother tongue in league with the U.S. 
imperialists can never be pardoned because they are aimed at 
keeping the Korean nation divided into two forever. 
  "In order to smash the moves to obliterate the national 
language on the part of the U.S. imperialists and their stooges 
in South Korea, all the Koreans who love the country and the 
nation must rise as one in the struggle to prevent a permanent 
division of the nation and achieve a unified development, be 
they in the North or in the South or overseas, be they 
communists or nationalists," stressed the reporter.

  [Text] The national meeting of trade union propaganda 
functionaries was held at the Central Workers' Hall on 18 
January. 
  Present at the meeting were functionaries concerned and 
exemplary trade union propaganda functionaries from all over the 
country. 
  The meeting discussed the tasks of trade union propaganda 
functionaries to further strengthen the entire trade unions' 
single- hearted unity around the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il. 
  Chu Song-il, chairman of the Central Committee of the 
General 
Federation of Trade Union of Korea made a report, then many 
participants joined discussions. 
  The reporter and those who participated in the discussions 
said that the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's teaching on 
accomplishment of the chuche revolutionary cause by rallying 
around the dear comrade leader as one mind is an immortal banner 
and programmatic teaching that elucidated the road for 
succeeding and consummating the socialist cause. They then 
pointed out that the trade union organizations have achieved 
success in uniting trade union members closely around the party 
by vigorously waging ideological indoctrination work. They 
noted that the trade union organizations at all levels and 
propaganda functionaries have carried out the indoctrination 
work to encourage trade union members to realize the dear 
comrade leader's greatness through various forms and methods and 
in a substantial manner. 
  They pointed out that all propaganda functionaries have made 
more than 100 volumes of educational materials in order to use 
them for propagandizing the greatness and in particular, 
substantively carried out indoctrination work through the song 
"Praising the Bright Star" composed by the great leader 
[suryong], thus contributing to fostering trade union members to 
be loyalists and dutiful children. 
  They said that by enhancing the role of trade union 
lecturers 
and by organizing economic agitation teams composed by the 
lecturers, they strengthened economic propaganda agitation work 
in major plants and enterprises, including Musan, Komdok, and 
Kim Chaek, and in major socialist construction sites. Thus, they 
actively inspired the working class and trade union members to 
implement the party's economic strategy. They stressed that with 
strengthened ideological indoctrination work in the trade 
unions, the lofty communist fine custom of rendering loyalty to 
the party and the leader and of dedicating everything to 
society, groups, and revolutionary comrades, has bloomed 
constantly among union members, and that a new turn was effected 
in their ideological and spiritual traits and work style. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: The main 
duty of workers' organizations is to indoctrinate and reform a 
broad range of masses and to make them firmly rally behind the 
party, and to vigorously organize and mobilize them into 
revolutionary struggle and construction workers. 
  The reporter and those who participated in the discussions 
said that the trade unions and propaganda functionaries at all 
levels are faced with a honorable task to further consolidate 
the single-hearted unity of our revolutionary ranks with the 
dear comrade leader as their center by strengthening ideological 
indoctrination work for union members and to actively contribute 
to the accomplishment of the socialist cause to the end by 
following his leadership. 
  Stressing that all trade union members should uphold, 
defend, 
and protect our party by cherishing revolutionary faith and 
will, they emphatically said that the indoctrination work should 
be vigorously carried out in order to make union members realize 
the greatness in ideology and theory of dear comrade leader, the 
greatness of his leadership, and greatness of his traits. 
  They emphasized that all union members should deeply study 
immortal works of dear comrade leader, including a collection of 
Kim Chong-il works, and that propaganda of art should be 
deepened among them in various methods and based on 
revolutionary songs, including "Without You, There Is No 
Fatherland," and "Only If There Is You, We Will Win," in 
compliance with concrete circumstances and character so that 
they trust and follow only the party by cherishing a sense of 
adoration. 
  They stressed that the revolutionary trait of loyally 
upholding the party's leadership should be established so that 
all trade unions implement the party's line and policy 
unconditionally and thoroughly. They spoke on the strengthening 
of political work to actively inspire union members to implement 
the three revolutions -- ideological, technological and cultural 
-- the general line of the socialist construction. 
  They stressed the strengthening of political propaganda and 
economic agitation to brilliantly implement the great leader's 
new year speech this year and decisions of the 21st plenary 
session of the Sixth Party Central Committee. They said that 
they should actively carry out propaganda work to better help 
rural communities materially and technically and with manpower 
in this significant year marking the 30th anniversary of 
publication of the rural thesis. They stressed that new 
innovations should be registered in production of light industry 
commodities and export goods. 
  The reporter and those participating in the discussions said 
that the workers' organizations, upholding the party's intention 
to satisfactorily implement the work of remaking people, will 
meet the party's trust and expectations by effecting a new turn 
in the work of ideological indoctrination work of trade unions. 
  A letter of pledge to Comrade Kim Chong-il, the dear leader 
of our party and people, was adopted during the meeting.

<F P=106> ["Revolutionary Spirit of Mt. Paektu Is Firm Guarantee of </F>
Accomplishing Revolutionary Cause of Chuche" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 15 (KCNA) -- The revolutionary 
spirit of Mt. Paektu was created in the days of the 
anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle waged under the wise 
guidance of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song. It is a 
spirit of unfailing loyalty to the leader, a revolutionary 
spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle to tide over 
difficulties by one's own effort and an indomitable 
revolutionary spirit of rising again and fighting even if one 
might fall a thousand and one times. NODONG SINMUN says this in 
an article today. 
  The article says: 
  The revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu underlies the 
tremendous force that made it possible to defeat the Japanese 
and the U.S. imperialists in the past and build a socialist 
power of independence, self-sustenance and self-reliance in 
defence on this land. Now it serves as an invincible 
ideological and moral weapon for the Korean people who are 
carrying the Korean-style socialist cause through to 
accomplishment. 
  It is, above all, an eternal life-giving water that helps 
the 
entire Korean people hold in high esteem the dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il with unfailing loyalty. 
  It contains the revolutionary attitude toward the leader and 
view of life that should be acquired by the chuche-type 
revolutionaries faithful to the party and the leader. 
  When we actively learn from the spirit, we can all become 
true revolutionaries like anti-Japanese revolutionary 
forerunners who staunchly fought with one mind of loyalty to the 
leader in any circumstances. 
  The revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu also powerfully 
encourages the Korean people to glorify the Korean-style 
socialism holding aloft the revolutionary banner of 
self-reliance and hard struggle. 
  The anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle was an arduous 
revolutionary war fought against the Japanese imperialists armed 
to the teeth in reliance on one's own strength with neither a 
state support nor foreign assistance. 
  The anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters always pulled 
through difficulties by displaying highly the revolutionary 
spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle in their struggle full 
of trials, and fully displayed the revolutionary habit of 
unconditionally carrying out any difficult and hard 
revolutionary tasks by their own effort. 
  The revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle 
displayed highly in those days has now become a powerful 
ideological and moral source for the Korean people in thoroughly 
implementing the party's revolutionary economic strategy and 
successfully building the Korean-style socialism. 
  Self-reliance is the only way to smash the imperialists' 
economic blockade and effect a steady upsurge in socialist 
economic construction. 
  There will be no tasks we cannot carry out, or no fortress 
we 
cannot occupy when we continue to actively follow the 
revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle 
displayed by the anti- Japanese revolutionary fighters. 
  The revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu is the ideological 
and 
moral source of the strength that enables the Korean people to 
staunchly go along the road of revolution with an indomitable 
fighting spirit and strong will.

  [Text] According to Hans Meyer, spokesman for the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], it seems that the 
next working-level contact between North Korea and the IAEA for 
negotiations on nuclear inspection will be delayed until next 
week. 
  Spokesman Meyer said that he had expected there would be a 
contact between the two sides this week for follow-up 
negotiations on the IAEA checklist that was delivered to North 
Korea on 9 January [as heard] for inspection of the seven 
reported nuclear facilities [haek sisol], and that now it seems 
that the next contact will be delayed until next week because 
there has been no response from North Korea as of the evening of 
14 January. 
  Regarding this, an IAEA source analyzed that the delay of 
the 
next contact may be considered a North Korean negotiation 
strategy, but he also pointed out the possibility that North 
Korea is taking pains in reviewing the details of the IAEA 
demand and deciding how to respond to it because of the large 
gap between the IAEA and North Korean positions on the nuclear 
inspection issue.

  [By Cha Man-sun from Vienna] 
  [Text] A third round of working-level contacts between the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and North Korea ended 
in a stalemate due to the two sides' differences in their basic 
position over general inspections [chonmyon sachal] of seven 
nuclear facilities in North Korea. 
  The IAEA and North Korea, at the third round of contacts 
held 
yesterday afternoon, discussed for three hours the issue of 
resuming inspections by reviewing Pyongyang's response to the 
IAEA demands. However, they failed to reach a consensus. 
  The IAEA, after having reviewed the North Korean 
authorities' 
response with the North Korean delegates, disclosed that North 
Korea had not signaled any green light to the IAEA demands, 
hinting that Pyongyang's response was a negative one.

  [Text] Vienna, Jan. 17 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) failed to make any 
progress Monday in their third working-level contact on the 
resumption of nuclear inspections, but the IAEA said there would 
be another contact soon. 
  Pyongyang did not give the IAEA a green light to resume 
inspection of its declared nuclear sites, agency spokesman Hans 
Meyer said. 
  In the three-hour contact at IAEA headquarters, the North 
Koreans conveyed their position and opinions in detail on IAEA 
inspection while IAEA officials explained details of the demands 
for inspection, he said, but did not make any further comment. 
  The IAEA team was led by operations director Demetrius 
Pericos and three diplomats from the North Korean Embassy in 
Vienna were headed by Yun Ho-chin, a councilor. 
  "I made the proposal enough to secure the continuity of 
nuclear safeguards," Yun said after the contact. "Next time, 
it's the IAEA's turn to answer, and the consultations will 
continue." 
  He declined, however, to comment on whether Pyongyang will 
allow inspection of its radiochemical laboratory and a 
5-megawatt reactor. 
  "You will get the information little by little," he said. 
  The North Koreans rejected the IAEA's demand for extraction 
of samples from the radiochemical laboratory and reactor while 
the IAEA people demanded that Pyongyang allow full-fledged 
inspection according to nuclear safeguards regulations, an IAEA 
source said. North Korea answered the requirements set by the 
IAEA at the second contact, Dec. 10, and the discussion focused 
on narrowing differences.

  [Text] Vienna, Jan. 18 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are expected to hold a 
fourth round of negotiations on IAEA inspection of North Korean 
nuclear facilities on Wednesday, informed sources said Tuesday. 
  Following a third round of working-level contacts Monday, 
IAEA Operations Director Demetrius Pericos and Yun Ho-jin, a 
councilor at the North Korean Embassy, met unofficially Tuesday 
and agreed to hold a fourth round on Wednesday, the sources said. 
  The successive meetings could mean that the negotiations are 
making rapid progress, IAEA sources said, hinting that there 
could be early inspections. 
  As a result, they said, the two sides could reach an 
agreement this week and the IAEA could start inspecting North 
Korean facilities by Jan. 24 at the earliest. 
  Or the two sides could work out some sort of agreement early 
next week so that an IAEA inspection team could enter North 
Korea by Jan. 31, the sources said. 
  This optimistic view comes after an official IAEA evaluation 
that there was "no green signal" in the third round, but the 
sources described the atmosphere of the talks as good and said 
that the two sides managed to narrow their differences. 
  One IAEA source, who like the others declined to be 
identified, said that both the IAEA and North Korea shared the 
opinion that an IAEA inspection, in whatever the form, has to be 
carried out before the IAEA holds its regular board of governors 
meeting on Feb. 21. 
  In other words, an IAEA inspection team has to go into North 
Korea in late January or early February in order for the IAEA to 
submit a report to the Board of Governors for it will take at 
least two weeks to inspect facilities and another week to 
prepare the report, the source said. 
  The IAEA Secretariat, which is giving "political 
significance" to the February board meeting because it is the 
start of a new fiscal year for the IAEA, wants to get tangible 
evidence to show in the negotiations with North Korea, which 
have been dragging along for more than a year now, the source 
said. 
  The Secretariat also likes to reach a kind of interim point 
with North Korea on inspection "in consideration" of the United 
States, which has publicly announced its agreement with North 
Korea. 
  As for North Korea, the IAEA could expect some sort of 
"concession" from Pyongyang because North Korea, too, has to 
demonstrate a positive attitude toward IAEA inspection in order 
to keep its negotiations with the United States going, the 
source said. 
  Details of the perceived progress being made at IAEA-North 
Korean negotiations are not known. 
  But what is known so far appears to be that the two sides 
have agreed in principle on the need for inspections on seven 
reported facilities, including the radiochemical laboratory and 
the 5-megawatt reactor, the source said. 
  As for differences of opinion on thorny issues such as the 
IAEA request for the collection of materials from the 
facilities, the two sides could discuss them so that another 
inspection team could be dispatched to North Korea later, the 
source said.

  [Text] At the fourth working-level contact held between 
the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and North Korea in 
Vienna this afternoon, the IAEA presented its official reply 
document to the letter from Pyongyang dated 17 January, and 
again urged North Korea to accept overall [chonmyon] 
inspections. Correspondent Cha Man-sun reports from Vienna. 
  [Begin Cha recording] This afternoon Korean time, the IAEA 
held the fourth round of working-level contact with the North 
Korean side and presented a document to North Korea in the form 
of a reply letter. This document presented the IAEA's position 
on points of dispute that were revealed on three occasions 
during working-level discussions. 
  The official document presented to the North Korean side by 
the IAEA is a reply to the reply letter of the Pyongyang 
authorities dated 17 January. It was learned that through this 
official document the IAEA stressed that it cannot accept 
limited [chehanjok] inspection, which the North Korean side 
insists on, and again strongly called on North Korea to accept 
overall inspections in compliance with the nuclear accord in 
order to recover promptly the continuity of inspections. 
  In particular, the IAEA clearly expressed its intention to 
conduct overall inspections -- not only replacement of 
surveillance devices, but also extraction of nuclear materials 
-- of the two sensitive nuclear facilities, including an atomic 
reactor and radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon, over which the 
two sides show acute differences in views. Such a position by 
the IAEA was conveyed verbally many times to the North Korean 
side in the course of working-level contacts. At the request of 
the working-level delegate representing the Pyongyang 
authorities, the IAEA presented its position in the form of a 
document. 
  Meanwhile, an IAEA source said that the North Korean 
response 
to this document is a matter of interest, however, Pyongyang is 
expected to finally accept overall inspections because North 
Korea, in contact with the United States, agreed [yanghae] to 
accept inspections demanded by IAEA. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Vienna-based correspondent Han Ki-pong: "No </F>
Progress in the Third Round of the Contact Between North 
Korea-International Atomic Energy Agency"] 
  [Text] The atmosphere in Vienna, where the North 
Korean-IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] negotiations 
over nuclear inspections have been underway for three weeks, is 
considerably different from the optimistic view Washington and 
Seoul have had in early January. Even though the third round of 
the official working-level contact between North Korea and the 
IAEA side was held on 17 January, no "green light" was shown, as 
expressed by the IAEA side. It has been learned that, through 
steady contacts in New York at the end of last year, the United 
States and North Korea reached a series of agreements on 
resuming ad hoc [imsi] and ordinary [tongsang] inspections, on 
the announcement of the discontinuation of the Team Spirit, on 
resuming the working-level contact for exchanging the 
North-South special envoys, and on resuming the third round of 
North Korean-U.S. talks. 
  Accordingly, it was expected that the IAEA inspection team 
would be able to enter the North by mid or late January, at the 
latest, without any problems. 
  However, as soon as technical negotiations between North 
Korea and the IAEA started, North Korea began to behave as 
though it had forgotten the political agreement. Such an 
atmosphere makes us believe that the U.S.-North Korean agreement 
attaches more importance to the beginning of the IAEA-North 
Korean negotiations to conduct ad hoc [imsi] and ordinary 
[tongsang] inspections, than to the resumption of full-scale ad 
hoc and ordinary inspections. 
  Actually, it is believed at the IAEA that, because the 
Clinton administration wants to have a diplomatic success, it 
might make "an early announcement." 
  The subjects of the three rounds of the official North 
Korean-IAEA negotiations have been: sounding out mutual 
positions (on 7 January), delivering the IAEA's technical demand 
conditions regarding inspections to North Korea (on 10 January), 
and delivering the North Korean side's position toward the 
IAEA's demand conditions (on 17 January). 
  The IAEA side has kept silent about the concrete contents of 
the negotiations. However, it has been learned that the great 
stumbling blocks to the negotiations are the scope of the 
inspections and technical issues. Among the seven nuclear 
facilities North Korea reported to the IAEA, North Korea has 
felt particularly nervous about the 5-MW Yongbyon experimental 
reactor, which is the most important one in clearing North 
Korea's nuclear suspicion; and a radiochemical laboratory, 
suspected to be a reprocessing facility. North Korea has assumed 
the position that it can receive restricted inspections by just 
allowing the replacement and repair of the existing monitoring 
equipment. North Korea has claimed that this is enough to 
guarantee the continuity of the nuclear safeguards accord. 
  The IAEA holds that the ad hoc inspections are aimed at 
verifying the accuracy and integrity of the reported facilities, 
that there is no alternative but to conduct full-scale and 
unconditional inspections. 
  Along with this, it has been learned that the issue 
concerning the number of inspections has yet to be resolved. 
  Regardless of the level of the political agreement reached 
between the United States and North Korea, it is certain that 
North Korea is once again trying to buy time. 
  North Korea has come to avoid international sanctions by 
beginning negotiations with the IAEA. It seems that North Korea 
is employing a two-pronged policy to leave behind a "nuclear 
suspicion," at the most, during negotiations with the IAEA. 
This is the very strategy North Korea had employed for the past 
year. Whenever North Korea has been driven to a corner, it has 
used a hard-line strategy of worsening the situation and 
benefiting from it. For example, when North Korea was faced 
with the pressure of special inspections, it withdrew from the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It will be two years in April 
since the nuclear safeguards accord was effectuated. However, 
North Korea has refused to receive even the ad hoc inspection, 
which is the most basic stage of the inspection, not to mention 
special inspections. North Korea has diverted the people's 
focus of attention elsewhere so that they regard even the 
resumption of the ad hoc inspection as progress in the nuclear 
issue. 
  It seems as though North Korea this time thinks it can still 
buy time. The fourth round of the IAEA-North Korean 
negotiations may be held on 19 or 20 January. However, it is 
difficult to expect that North Korea will change its position at 
once. 
  North Korea will probably accept full-scale ad hoc 
inspections at a time when it believes that it can obtain the 
greatest benefit from the third round of the high-level talks 
with the United States. 
  It seems that North Korea has planned it can prevent the 
issue of special inspections from being a key point in the 
agenda at the third round of the high-level talks.

<F P=106> [Article by Kim Cha-su: "Turning the Joint Declaration of </F>
the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula Into an 
International Treaty"] 
  [Text] The Foreign Ministry feels nervous about minimizing 
the stir regarding the report that the United States is calling 
on the ROK to turn the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization 
of the Korean Peninsula into an international treaty. It seems 
the Foreign Ministry is concerned about a breakup of the 
cooperative system with the United States, which may take place 
during the final stage of the U.S.-North Korean negotiations. 
<H5>  The Government's Position </H5>
  The government opposes the U.S. proposal to turn the Joint 
Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula into 
an international treaty. That is, the government contends that 
because the joint declaration of denuclearization signed in 1992 
is not a treaty between countries but an agreement signed within 
the nation, the government does not need to turn it into an 
international treaty. 
  The government believes the issue of North Korea constantly 
keeping nuclear reprocessing facilities, even after adopting the 
joint declaration of denuclearization, should be resolved 
through North-South dialogue. In other words, the government 
believes that the government should persuade North Korea to 
destroy the nuclear reprocessing facilities through the Joint 
Nuclear Control Committee and, then, abide by the joint 
declaration of denuclearization. 
  A government official explained that "the U.S. proposal to 
turn the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean 
Peninsula into an international treaty is a result of 
considering North Korea's demand for a guarantee that a nuclear 
preemptive strike on the DPRK will not take place." That is, 
there is a possibility that because North Korea indeed regards 
as serious a nuclear threat from the United States and others, 
it may stick to nuclear development. Thus, in order to ease 
North Korea's threat, it is necessary for the nuclear-possessing 
countries to promise not to conduct a nuclear attack on North 
Korea. 
  Government officials have analyzed that the United States is 
intending to supplement the weak points of the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) by turning the joint declaration 
of denuclearization into an international treaty. The current 
NPT regulations stipulate that NPT member countries can have 
nuclear reprocessing facilities and inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] are only required of 
the plutonium produced from the nuclear reprocessing process. 
Accordingly, if the joint declaration of denuclearization is 
turned into an international treaty, North and South Korea 
cannot have nuclear reprocessing facilities so suspicions of 
nuclear development on the Korean peninsula will be fully 
abolished. There was a (Tulatert) protocol signed by South 
American countries, including Brazil and Argentina, in 1967 in 
which the nuclear-possessing countries acknowledged the contents 
that had been agreed upon by the relevant countries. 
  At that time, when the South American countries resolved not 
to develop and possess nuclear weapons, they called on the 
nuclear- possessing countries, including the United States, to 
acknowledge the guarantee of refraining from a nuclear attack on 
them. Thus, the nuclear-possessing countries turned the 
agreement into an international treaty through a protocol. 
  It can be said that the United States has tried to apply 
this 
precedent to the Korean peninsula. 
<H5>  Reaction From the Academic World </H5>
  Scholars generally oppose the U.S. proposal to turn the 
joint 
declaration of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula into 
an international treaty. 
  Dr. Chon Song-hun from the Institute of National Unification 
said: "To turn the declaration of the denuclearization of the 
Korean peninsula into an international treaty, the nuclear issue 
of the Northeast Asian countries surrounding the Korean 
peninsula, including China and Japan, as well, should be 
discussed simultaneously." 
  Dr. Chon stressed that "either the whole Northeast Asia area 
should be denuclearized or nuclear-possessing countries should 
clearly assure that they will not launch a nuclear attack 
against North and South Korea." 
  Professor Yun Tok-min from the Research Institute of 
Diplomatic and Security Affairs, too, insisted: "If North and 
South Korea are to declare to the world that they will not 
possess nuclear reprocessing facilities permanently, all 
Northeast Asian countries should also clearly promise that they 
will not possess nuclear reprocessing facilities." 
  Concerning the nuclear reprocessing facilities in North 
Korea 
Professor Yun also stressed that "this problem should be solved 
according to the principle of solving problems between the North 
and the South." 
  Professor Yi Sam-song from Hallim University said that from 
a 
long-term perspective nuclear reprocessing facilities should be 
completely eliminated from the Korean peninsula. He said that 
nuclear reprocessing facilities themselves are synonymous with a 
nuclear waste processing plant and that, therefore, there is a 
high possibility of creating environmental pollution. He also 
said that due to the development of the technology of nuclear 
energy, there is a high possibility of developing substitute 
fuel, which is more stable and efficient than plutonium 
extracted through the nuclear reprocessing process. 
  Professor Yi said, however, that we should prudently 
consider 
the fact that the issue of abolishing reprocessing facilities on 
the Korean peninsula should be settled in consideration of the 
appropriate process to be taken and of mutuality [sanghosong]. 
What professor Yi insists is that the issue of abolishing 
nuclear reprocessing facilities on the Korean peninsula should 
be pushed ahead in combination with the issue of denuclearizing 
the whole Northeast Asia area after the nuclear negotiations, 
which are being held between North Korea and the United States, 
reach a comprehensive solution. 
  In other words, in its negotiations with North Korea the 
United States should, first of all, discuss the issue of 
abolishing nuclear reprocessing facilities after it has cleared 
North Korea's apprehensions of a security threat. Only through 
such a process, can the joint declaration of the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula be developed into one 
which declares that the countries surrounding the Korean 
peninsula, such as China and Japan, should not possess nuclear 
reprocessing facilities. 
  In conclusion, many scholars hold that the issue of 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula should be solved in 
accordance with the principle of solving problems between North 
and South Korea, without destroying the potential for possessing 
nuclear reprocessing facilities in case of need in the future.

<F P=106> [Article by Pak Ui-chun: "Policy Adjustments by </F>
Unification-Related Ministers Attracts Interest"] 
  [Text] Since new Deputy Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok 
replaced the progresively-inclined former Deputy Prime Minister 
and Unification Minister Han Wan-sang, who served for a short 
period of time, the issue of harmony within the government's 
unification- affairs team has emerged as a matter of people's 
interest. Under circumstances in which North-South dialogue, 
including working-level contact for the exchange of special 
envoys between the North and the South, is expected to be 
resumed soon, remarkable differences in the natures of 
unification-related ministers have been revealed, particularly, 
between Deputy Prime Minister Yi and Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu in many aspects. 
  Since he assumed the post of deputy prime minister--overseer 
of unification policies--Yi brought up the North Korean human 
rights issue, which is considered to be the most sensitive issue 
for North Korea. Following this, on 11 January, during his 
visit to the administration office for the five North Korean 
provinces in Kugidong, Seoul, he stressed that "in order to 
achieve the reunification we desire, North Korea must also 
change," and that he would not hold dialogue merely as a matter 
of formality. 
  In a recent interview with a daily newspaper, he said that 
"for North and South of Korea to reconcile substantially and 
advance toward reunification, holding a substantive meeting is 
important. This is what has prompted my recent remarks that the 
time for us to choose words only to please North Korea are now 
gone." His remarks clearly hark back to remarks made in the era 
of North-South confrontational diplomacy clearly, and clearly 
display his disposition. His remarks can also be interpreted to 
be a signal that he will implement different policies from those 
of his predecessor who stressed an "appeasement policy" in a bid 
to induce North Korea to open up. 
  An expert in North Korean affairs pointed out: Deputy Prime 
Minister Yi consistently makes improvisatory, expedient remarks 
instead of providing concrete principles by which we should 
abide. Such remarks are not helpful to future North-South 
relations. 
  Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Han, who is in fact exclusively 
handing the North Korean nuclear issue that has emerged as the 
core of North-South problems, was denounced by North Korea 
sometime ago for his hardline remarks against the North. 
However, his position has always been one of emphasizing 
"dialogue," and has thus avoided making remarks that would 
irritate North Korea. 
  In an article entitled "Foreign Minister Han and the North 
Korean Nuclear Issue," THE NEW YORK TIMES of the United States 
recently wrote that "Minister Han regards North Korea not as a 
sworn enemy but as a capricious, sometime unpredictable, and 
violent partner and sometimes, as an old relative. Thus, he is 
full of confidence in dealing with North Korea with a sense of 
humor and negotiations to the last." This article adequately 
portrays his nature. 
  The two also seem to differ on their standpoint on North 
Korea which is the underlying consciousness to resolving the 
North Korean problem. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Yi was involved in the working-level 
contacts for sending and receiving relief materials between 
North and South Korea in 1984, and attended the 10th full-dress 
meeting of North-South Red Cross talks in December 1985 as a 
senior delegate to the Red Cross talks. As a result, he seems 
to be keenly aware that North Korea is chiefly responsible for 
the fact that meetings were held only for the sake of talks 
between the North and the South and that there was no 
substantive improvement in North-South relations. 
  Therefore, although he does not make remarks openly, Deputy 
Prime Minister Yi, like many other conservatives, seems to 
firmly believe that North Koreans are not to be trusted and that 
a great number of problems exist in North Korea. On the other 
hand, Minister Han has said: While North Korea uses tactics of 
driving the situation to an extreme on one hand, it also appears 
to use reason in handling issues overall. However, there are 
differences in views between upper-level and lower-level 
officials which is a factor undermining such reason. This 
factor is being reflected in negotiation conditions and 
attitudes in actual negotiations. 
  Minister Han's such view on North Korea reflects a position 
and will to understand North Korea and to overcome such 
problems. Thus, his view, in general, is similar to that of 
former Deputy Prime Minister Han, with only a slight difference. 
However, there is a great distance between the views of 
Minister Han and new Deputy Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok. This 
somewhat progressive viewpoint of Minister Han did not attract 
much attention as it was shadowed by former Deputy Prime 
Minister Han's remarks, which served as a shield. 
  However, with no Deputy Prime Minister Han, Foreign Minister 
Han should now attempt to stand alone, because at a glance, no 
one else amongst the unification-related ministers seems to be 
more progressive than himself.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan. 17 (YONHAP) -- The North Korean 
Workers' (Communist) Party recently formed a South Korea 
operations team led by Kim Yong-chu and Kim Tal-hyon, deputy 
leader, reliable Western sources said Monday. 
  The team was formed after the Ninth Supreme People's 
Assembly 
held its sixth plenary meeting last December, when Kim Yong-chu, 
younger brother of President Kim Il-song, was returned to the 
party leadership and Kim Tal-hyon resigned as deputy premier and 
chairman of the State Planning Commission. 
  "This has been confirmed by eastern European diplomats in 
Pyongyang," said the sources, who are well informed of North 
Korea's affairs. 
  In parallel with its move to settle the nuclear issue, North 
Korea appears to be moving to prepare for dialogue with South 
Korea, expected to resume as soon as the nuclear issue is 
settled, they said. 
  Both Kims are known as moderates in their policy toward 
South 
Korea, and their appointment as top South Korea policymakers 
gives rise to expectations that North Korea will improve its 
relations with South Korea. 
  Kim Tal-hyon's appointment as deputy team leader signifies 
that he is still a member of the party leadership, defying 
rumors that he was demoted to manager of a textile factory.

<F P=106> [Article by Min Pyong-il] </F>
  [Text] Macao -- There appears to have been a major change 
in the composition of the North Korean setup here following the 
return of Kim Yong-chu, younger brother of Kim Il-song, to power 
recently. 
  Kang Sang-chun, the general manager of the Macao Chokwang 
Trading Co., thought to be Pyongyang's intelligence office in 
Macao, was recalled and deputy general manager Pak Cha-pyong 
took over as general manager and chairman of the company on Dec 
18, 1993, according to a North Korean watcher who wished not to 
be identified. 
  "For Pak, it was a glorious return, for when the North 
Koreans first set up shop in Macao back in 1974, it was Pak who 
headed the firm," he explained. 
  Another North Korean watcher told THE KOREA HERALD that Pak 
was general manager of the company for many years and was very 
active in the Macao social circles. 
  "It was Pak who had placed North Korea on the Macao map, so 
to speak. Whenever there were major functions, particularly 
China-related, such as national day receptions of the People's 
Republic of China or spring festival activities by the 
Beijing-oriented Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Pak would 
always be there" he disclosed. 
  In the 1980s, however, as the fortunes of Chokwang Trading 
Co. fell, so did Pak. 
  First, North Korean military personnel engineered a mass 
assassination plot in Rangoon in October 1983: most of the 
cabinet members and aides accompanying then President Chon 
Tu-hwan were killed. Chon was on his way to a national cemetery 
when the explosion occurred and escaped unharmed. 
  Then, a Korean Airline (KAL) passenger plane exploded in 
mid-air over the Indian Ocean, killing all aboard in 1987. Two 
persons, one elderly man and a girl, Kim Hyon-hui, were arrested 
in a Middle East city for sabotage. Both swallowed poison but 
the girl survived. 
  It was later confirmed that Kim Hyon-hui and her senior 
accomplice had been trained in Macao for six months before they 
planted the bomb on the KAL plane. 
  According to North Korean watchers here, a serious car 
accident, involving explosives, occurred in Macao within one or 
two years after the KAL bombing. 
  Several senior officials of the Chokwang Trading Co. in the 
car were killed and their bodies were returned to Pyongyang 
without Macao officials being allowed to perform autopsies. 
  "It was rumored that the men were killed on Pyongyang's 
order 
and that Macao security keeps a very close watch on Chokwang," a 
North Korean watcher here said. 
  Shortly after these incidents, Pak, who had by then become 
very unpopular, was recalled to North Korea. 
  His successors came, but like the Vietnamese officials who 
came to Hong Kong after the 1979 border incident with China, 
they adopted a low profile, he explained. 
  "Although they were duty bound to turn up at the many 
functions they always kept to a corner and tried not to attract 
attention -- just like the Vietnamese in Hong Kong," he 
disclosed. 
  Despite this, the source went on to say, protocol was 
observed to the hilt by all parties. On Kim Il-song's birthday, 
for example, the Macao XINHUA News Agency would send flower 
trays to Chokwang and Chokwang would hold small parties. 
  While Kang was managing the Chokwang, according to the North 
Korean watcher, Pak suddenly turned up in 1992, apparently in a 
bid to regain some of the North Korean limelight because, he is 
still well-known in the Macao community. 
  "However, he was demoted to deputy general manager. Part of 
his duties appears to be the reestablishment of North Korean 
prestige and also the reorganization of North Korean business 
activities in Macao," he explained. 
  In these two fields, he explained that there has been some 
progress. Pak is now in his early 60s and should retire soon 
but he has once again been appointed general manager. 
  "Speculation is ripe here that his returning to the post may 
either be a kind of reward for his contribution to Pyongyang or 
a move to coordinate the return to power of Kim Il-song's 
brother, Kim Yong-chu," he added.

quoted as saying by MOSCOW NEWS [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI]. 
  "North Korea was determined in its plan for military 
application of nuclear technology, and according to our 
assessment it was near success," Lt. Gen. Gennadiy Yevstafiyev, 
director-general of massive destruction weapon control bureau of 
the external intelligence office, says in an interview with the 
weekly in Friday's edition. 
  Pyongyang froze its nuclear development program for two 
reasons, however, because of the international pressure and the 
recognition that it could no longer afford the enormous 
financial burden, Yevstafiyev says. 
  As a result, he says, the communist regime may give up its 
nuclear program altogether and go entirely public on its nuclear 
sites. 
  The intelligence officer points out that extra care is 
needed 
so as not to upset the sensitive political situation of North 
Korea, which is in the middle of a power transfer. 
  Moscow agrees with international experts on the gravity of 
the North Korean nuclear problem, he says, adding that 
Pyongyang's leaders have long sought to manufacture nuclear, 
biological and chemical weapons and have already succeeded in 
developing a delivery systems by modifying Scud missiles into 
the Nodong-1. 
  Yevstafiyev names North Korea the most dangerous country in 
the world, with the potential to make nuclear weapons. Next on 
his list are Israel, India and Pakistan. 
  He says Pyongyang is playing a big game with Washington in 
their "nuclear dialogue" and Moscow has therefore to put its 
national interests first to guarantee safety in the Far East.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 17 (YONHAP) -- The Foreign Ministry 
expressed concern Monday [17 January] at Russian sales of 
submarines to North Korea lest they be used for something other 
than for scrap. 
  Paek Nak-wan, director-general for European Affairs, met 
with 
Georgiy Toloraya, minister at the Russian Embassy in Seoul, and 
explained South Korea's interest in the matter and requested 
Moscow to disclose the scope of the sale. 
  Latest press reports quoted a senior official at the Russian 
Pacific Fleet Command as saying Russia signed a contract to sell 
North Korea 10 Golf II class submarines not long after it 
exported four Fox-Trot class submarines to the communist country. 
  The Golf II submarines are similar to the Fox-Trot types in 
size, but excel them in speed and cruising range and can carry 
three SS-N-5 ballistic missiles. 
  Reports said that the sales were under condition that North 
Korea use the vessels for scrap. 
  "If these reports turn out all true, I hope that the vessels 
will indeed be used for scrap only," said Paek, "but we express 
concern that North Korea might try to use the submarines for 
other purposes."

  [Text] Moscow, Jan. 18 (YONHAP) -- The Golf II class 
submarines that the Russian fleet is selling to North Korea can 
carry ballistic missiles, Western defense analysts in Moscow 
said Tuesday. 
  A senior officer of the Russian Pacific Fleet was quoted as 
saying that Russia signed a contract with Pyongyang to sell 10 
Golf II submarines in a report in a Japanese newspaper Sunday. 
  The Golf II class was outfitted by the Russian Navy with 
ballistic missiles and North Korea could load its recently 
modified Nodong-1 scud missiles on the submarines if they were 
delivered intact, the analysts said. 
  Golf II submarines were manufactured until the late 1980s 
and 
are an improvement on the Fox-Trot class vessels already sold to 
North Korea and excel the submarines currently owned by the 
communist country, they said. 
  Russian Navy officers say the submarines were sold on 
condition that they are used for scrap, but North Korea may try 
to recycle them for military purposes. 
  The Russian Defense Ministry kept silence on the submarine 
kind and sales condition on Monday, but denied a report by the 
TOKYO SHIMBUN. 
  The Foreign Ministry acknowledged the contract to South 
Korean diplomats in Moscow, but assured them that the submarines 
were sold as scrap like ordinary exports. 
  It has not been revealed whether Russia was selling just the 
hulls or included the engines, and it is a serious matter if the 
latter were included, the defense analysts said. 
  Navy public relations officers affirmed that the submarines 
to be sold to North Korea would be dismantled under the 
observation of Russian military experts so that they cannot be 
used for anything but scrap. 
  But as its submarines are outdated and obtaining spare parts 
is very difficult, North Korea may cannibalize the Russian 
submarines to use the parts in their own submarines, the 
analysts said. 
  Because the Golf II and Fox-Trot classes are more modern 
than 
its submarines, North Korea's submarine technology will improve 
even if the Russian vessels arrive dismantled, they said. 
  Japan is said to be seriously worried because the Golf II 
submarines can carry ballistic missiles. In addition to the 10 
Golf II submarines, Russia has sold and delivered four Fox-Trot 
types to North Korea, according to the TOKYO SHIMBUN.

<F P=106> [By Han Chong-ho] </F>
  [Text] Recently the Japanese Foreign Ministry issued a 
report entitled, "Looking Back on the International Situation 
and Its Prospects." This report sums up the diplomacy of 1993 
and elucidates diplomatic goals for 1994. This report says that 
the greatest diplomatic tasks for this year are improving 
U.S.-Japan relations and dealing with North Korea's nuclear 
issue. In particular, if North Korea agrees to accept the 
International Atomic Energy Agency's complete inspection at the 
U.S.-North Korea negotiations, Japan and North Korea will resume 
working-level contacts in Beijing which was suspended since the 
eighth Japan-North Korea negotiations in November 1992. 
  The Japan-North Korea talks which started in January 1991 
discussed issues including the issue of compensation for the war 
crimes committed by Japan. These issues were discussed prior to 
discussing the establishment of diplomatic relations. When the 
Japanese side brought up the issue of Yi Un-hye (the Japanese 
instructor to former North Korean terrorist Kim Hyon-hui who was 
responsible for the bombing of the Korean Air Lines plane in 
1983), the North Korean side left the negotiating table and 
talks have been suspended since. Japan proposed resuming talks 
on many occasions, but the North Koreans rejected it each time. 
A Japanese source in Seoul said: "The Japanese Embassy in 
Beijing frequently telephones the North Korean Embassy in 
Beijing on meeting, but the North Korean side continues to 
reject our proposal." 
  A Japanese diplomat who assumed office in Beijing in July 
1993 has not yet exchanged greetings with the North Korean side. 
North Korea only recognizes the United States as a counterpart 
to dialogue and has even left out the ROK. Therefore, the 
Japanese Government is not hastening to resume the Japan-North 
Korea talks and is maintaining a position of observing 
U.S.-North Korea negotiations. 
  However, the Japanese side is becoming active again. On 28 
December 1993, Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata revealed a 
desire to resume negotiations with North Korea by using the 
issue of compensation as a starting point. Also on 9 January, 
on his way home from visiting China he held a news conference 
and openly proposed to the North Korean side that negotiations 
be resumed. Compensation is an issue because North Korea demands 
compensation for Japan's illegal colonialization of Korea which 
Japan insists that the Japanese annexation of Korea was 
legitimate and will only recognize property rights and claims of 
unpaid wages. 
  Japan has been experiencing difficulties in the talks 
because 
of North Korea's nuclear issue. It also revealed that if North 
Korea is willing, talks with North Korea may be resumed at 
anytime. However there are doubts on whether Japan truly wants 
to achieve talks to establish diplomatic relations with North 
Korea. 
  Kim Pong-chin, professor at Japan's North Kyushu University, 
is in agreement with this claim. In a paper written for a 
scientific journal published at the National Unification 
Research Institute, he analyzed: "The greatest agenda in the 
Japan-North Korea negotiations to establish diplomatic relations 
is the issue of liquidating the past. The reason that North 
Korea is rejecting the talks is that Japan is intentionally 
neglecting internal tasks such as the issue of compensation by 
putting forth external elements such as the nuclear issue." 
Professor Kim continued: "Based on the Cold War era way of 
thinking, Japan is playing the role of proxy for the U.S. policy 
toward North Korea and is trying to advance its own interests to 
the utmost by taking advantage of the weak points and 
limitations of the ROK's North Korea policy." 
  Japan's situation on the issue of North Korea's nuclear 
issue 
is summarized as 'accepting reality as it is to establish 
countermeasures.' This theory is that a countermeasure must be 
provided to prevent nuclear development since a war may break 
out if sanctions are carried out toward North Korea. More than 
any other country, Japan is a country that generates the most 
rumors of danger on the Korean peninsula. Therefore, it is 
peculiar for Japan to reach such a leisurely conclusion. What 
Japan is promoting from the level of 'taking measures' for 
nuclear development is the Theater Missile Defense plan. Japan 
claims that this is the interceptor system of North Korea's 
NODONG No. 1 missile, but the ROK experts think that Japan is 
using North Korea's threat to form a nuclear weapons 
transportation system. 
  With North Korea's nuclear problem an issue, Japan is able 
to 
favorably lead the Japan-North Korea negotiations towards 
establishing diplomatic relations and is using the nuclear issue 
to promote arms proliferation. Once the nuclear issue moves 
toward settlement, Japan will once again resort to liquidating 
the past to promote economic relations. Thus, Japan is showing 
flexibility in adapting to reality. This is the true nature of 
Japan's practical diplomacy toward the Korean peninsula. 
  The National Unification Board presented a report 
entitled "Current Situation and Prospect of Economic Relations 
Between Japan and North Korea" during parliamentary inspections 
of government offices last year. According to this report, 
Japan's post-war policy toward the Korean peninsula was fixed 
within the framework of U.S. policy on Korea. Since the 
mid-eighties, however, Japan has pursued practical diplomacy 
based on a policy of maintaining equal distance towards both 
South and North Korea under the pretext of the slogan, "Post-war 
liquidation with North Korea." This report assesses that Japan's 
strategy toward the Korean peninsula has two parts -- the first 
aims at expanding political influence on the Korean peninsula by 
normalizing relations with North Korea, and the second aims at 
promoting economic infiltration with capital and technology in 
the initiative to reorganize order in Northeast Asia. 
  North Korea and Japan have virtually restored relations 
although they have yet to formally establish diplomatic 
relations. In 1992, a government inspection team presented a 
surprising report after visiting various places in Japan to 
inspect cooperative relations between Japan and North Korea. 
This report reads: "Japanese businesses have already completed 
the planning and survey stage and have gained an understanding 
of North Korea's industrial situation, examined main projects 
for important areas of North Korea, and studied conditions for 
investment in North Korea. They are believed to have 
established personal relations with leading figures in North 
Korea -- influential figures, provincial party officials, and 
managers of local industrial complexes. It is a matter of 
concern that the North Korean economy may become subject to that 
of Japan once diplomatic relations between the two are 
established. 
<H5>  Japan's Foreign Ministry Concerned About Information Leakage </H5>
  Japan's East Asian Trade Institute and the Japan-North 
Korean 
Trade Association visited Pyongyang together on two occasions in 
April 1991 and July 1992 to discuss items that North Korea may 
want to develop and import. Experts are saying that the 
"tripartite trade route" connecting North Korea and Japan 
through the former Soviet Union and Hong Kong in the fifties and 
the sixties has been revived as the "tripartite investment 
route." 
  Likewise, Japan is disregarding the nuclear issue and 
steadily pushing ahead with work to expand its own interests in 
North Korea. The United States and the ROK will not intervene in 
Japan's affairs as long as Japan cooperates in the resolution of 
the nuclear issue and the improvement of South-North relations. 
In the beginning of the new year, ROK Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu said that he would establish various diplomatic 
measures in preparation for the North Korean establishment of 
diplomatic ties with the United States and Japan. Regarding 
this, a ROK diplomat in Seoul said, "Japan must obtain ROK and 
U.S. consent before establishing diplomatic ties with North 
Korea. North Korea is well aware of this. Minister Han's 
remarks on ROK support in the establishment of diplomatic ties 
between the two means that the ROK is willing to conciliate 
North Korea with the Japan card in the last stage of 
negotiations for resolving the nuclear issue, and not that it 
will actually help in the establishment of North Korea-Japan 
diplomatic relations." 
  Reaching a resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue 
means 
the beginning of a new diplomatic war. Japan is preparing for a 
new strategy towards the Korean peninsula while ROK leaders 
dream sweet dreams of South-North dialogue, whose resumption 
remains distant. 
  On 28 December 1993, a visit to North Korea by a delegation 
of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDP] led by dietman 
Hajime Hukata, director of the Organizational Department of the 
SDP Central Committee and executive officer of the Japan-DPRK 
Friendship Promotion League at the request of the Workers Party 
of Korea [WPK] generated interest from diplomatic circles. 
Hukata is a typical pro-North Korea politician who had visited 
North Korea on 28 September 1990 with Kanemaru, then-vice 
president of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, to realize 
the joint tripartite declaration. He met Hwang Chang-yop, 
secretary of the WPK and chairman of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, on 30 December. 
Hwang Chang-yop leads the work to establish diplomatic ties 
with Japan as the head of a special agency recently established 
by North Korea on re-establishing diplomatic relations with 
Japan. 
  Hukata's visit to North Korea, however, failed to interest 
ROK and Japanese media because an SDP dietman's visit to North 
Korea is not meaningful under the situation, in which the 
coalition ruling party's future is unclear. An official of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, "I observed Hukata's visit to 
North Korea with interest, but didn't find anything worth 
noticing." 
  Ever since the pro-North Korean SDP became the ruling party, 
the Japanese Foreign Ministry has become deep suspicious of the 
coalition ruling party's policy toward North Korea. An 
influential dietman of the Japan Renewal Party, Hajime Isihi, 
was the executive officer of the team to visit North Korea in 
1990, and Chief Cabinet Secretary Kajimura, who controls key 
departments of the cabinet such as the Intelligence Office, the 
Foreign Policy Deliberation Office, and the Security Office, was 
the deputy executive officer of the delegation to North Korea. 
An unidentified Japanese foreign ministry official told the 
Japanese press that "It [the Foreign Ministry] cannot help but 
worry about possible information leakage since most of the 
Hosokawa regime's members are pro-North Korea." 
  Japan's diplomatic policy is influenced by government 
officials. Regarding this, an observer well-versed in Japanese 
affairs, said to keep an eye on Yutaca Kawashima, minister at 
the Japanese Embassy in the ROK from July 1992 until November 
1993, when he was appointed director of the Foreign Ministry's 
Asia Department, the hub of Japan's foreign policy.

government to protect the human rights of foreign workers, 
charging that they are forced to work long hours for low wages. 
  "Nearly 100,000 foreign workers are suffering from long 
working hours and low wages, but most of them are here illegally 
so their basic human rights are not properly protected by the 
law," a CCEJ spokesman said. 
  Almost 100 CCEJ members joined a march to demand protection 
for the human rights of foreign workers.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 18 (YONHAP) -- The Agency for National 
Security Planning (NSP) will increase its information-gathering 
capability to better help industry prepare for the coming era of 
borderless markets by being more competitive, NSP Director Kim 
Tok said in his new year business report to President Kim 
Yong-sam on Tuesday. 
  It will strengthen its early-warning capability by stepping 
up its efforts to collect and analyze data on North Korea, 
including information on developments in North Korea's nuclear 
development program, its policy toward South Korea and its 
military structure. 
  The NSP will be restructured in accordance with the NSP law 
as amended late last year so that it can better promote the 
national interest and security, Director Kim said. 
  Information services for the private sector will be 
increased 
to make the NSP an intelligence and information agency in which 
the people have full trust, he said. 
  President Kim responded to the report by expressing his hope 
that the NSP grows into a world-level information and 
intelligence agency. 
  "We're living in an era where information is power," he told 
the NSP chief.

<F P=106> [Article by Yu Yong-won: "Rugby Ball Bounces Unpredictably"] </F>
  [Text] "What do you for your pay?" "Defense Logistics 
Agency [DLA] Director, I do not quite understand. After all 
your logical explanations, you yourself do not understand 
clearly either. Do you?" "Defense Security Commander, when did 
you learn about this case [fraudulent shell purchase incident]? 
  The above is a scene from the high-ranking military 
officials' "hearing" that took place in the first meeting room 
of the Ministry of National Defense [MND] called suddenly on 22 
December 1993. Such "hearings" and "lectures" followed one after 
another in the MND after new Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae took 
office. It is difficult to imagine Minister Yi's continuous 
unpredictable acts. 
  On 22 December, immediately after his appointment, the first 
formal meeting was held with 120 high-ranking military officials 
from the MND, the Joint Chiefs of Staff [JCS], and chief of each 
service. There, Minister Yi made the participants sweat by 
unceasingly reprimanding the director of the DLA (lieutenant 
general), the head of the special prosecution team (lieutenant 
general), the chief of the Logistics Bureau (major general), the 
second assistant vice minister, and the commander of Defense 
Security Command (brigadier general) for the recent controversy 
over the gun shell purchase fraud case. In the meeting, 
Minister Yi urged the relevant military officials to wake up, 
asking how the people could accept the case when he himself 
barely understood it. 
  In addition to the "hearing-style" reprimand, Minister Yi 
surprised many relevant officials once again that day by 
personally writing on the board to explain, as if he were a 
teacher giving a lecture, each time he was supposed to stand up 
to defend his dignity. By taking an example of U.S. Generals 
Vessey and Meyers, Minister Yi drew a diagram in an attempt to 
dispel some people's worries that there would be a large-scale 
personnel reshuffle because JCS Chief Yi Yang-ho is one year 
Minister Yi's senior, and Kim Tong-chin, chief of Staff of the 
ROK Army, is a fellow graduate of the 17th class of the Military 
Academy. Like an instructor of an institute talking to 
students, Minister Yi repeatedly stressed, "This is the point. 
Please underline (or take a second look)," about the subjects 
he wanted to emphasize. 
  Minister Yi's "diagram-style lecture" continued on 28 
December when he declared the full-scale re-audit and inspection 
of the Yulgok Project [ROK Army weapons purchase program] and 
the defense logistics system and facilities. After reading the 
prepared announcement, he continued to give his own 15-minute 
"enthusiastic lecture" while drawing diagrams on the board. He 
stressed the following four points: The Yulgok Project reform 
is a true reform; two major directions to improve the Yulgok 
Project; the inspection is not aimed at specific figures like a 
"witch hunt" inspection; and supplementary measures for audit 
and inspection. He used a unique expression of "making the 
Yulgok Project truly worthy of Yulgok." 
  Sudden proposal of silent tribute during inauguration 
speech, 
"Let us think of the beloved soldiers" [subhead] 
  Such "Don Quixote-style" acts were seen again at his 
inauguration ceremony. At the inauguration ceremony held on the 
morning of 22 December in the Army Hall inside the MND, after 
reading only the usual greeting part from his prepared 
inauguration speech, he said, "Now, I will talk about three 
major points I want to emphasize," and gave an impromptu speech 
for over 10 minutes. 
  "First of all, we should prevent a disastrous war, which 
would cause common destruction of the North and the South, by 
maximizing combat capabilities. Second, we should achieve a 
true reform in the national defense field by driving out 
inefficiency, incompetency, corruption, and irregularities. 
Third, we should have a strict sense of professionalism over 
our duty and the Army." 
  Stating that the next year's [1994] National Defense budget 
is a tremendous burden to the people forcing each household to 
share 910,000 won, Minister Yi continued to say in a high tone 
of voice: "The Army should manage and administer defense 
manpower and resource with heart-trembling piety." Minister Yi 
repeated with particular emphasis the phrase "with 
heart-trembling piety." He also added in a high tone of voice, 
"(the soldiers) should not spend their time by merely reading 
newspapers and magazines but they should read about the enemy 
(North Korea) which threatens us." 
  Stating "Let us think of our beloved soldiers who are on 
guard duty day and night and are engaged in operation while 
exposed to severe cold temperatures and cold wind blowing from 
the North," Minister Yi paid silent tribute to soldiers, 
momentarily suspending his inaugural address. 
  There are two contradictory reactions among military 
personnel concerning Minister Yi's "eccentric behavior." One is 
the group of "affirmative assessment" which interprets his 
behavior as an expression of strong will to push ahead with 
genuine reform drive in order to make the military worthy of the 
military, and another is the "critics" group that claims he 
deals lightly with high-ranking general officers, who regard 
honor and authority as their own lives; by holding press 
interviews too frequently; and being conscious of his own 
publicity. 
  However, most of military-related officials share the view 
that Minister Yi is doing his utmost to recover the honor of the 
military, which has been driven into a corner with the shells 
import incident. It was learned that for the first two weeks 
after he came to office, Minister Yi stayed late in his office, 
between 2200 to 0130, in order to acquaint himself with the 
work, except when he had to attend an unavoidable official 
dinner meeting or other functions. With the minister's forced 
march, working-level officials could not return to their homes 
until late at night, even during the year-end days. 
  Many military officials are concerned with the fact that the 
scope of Minister Yi's choice is not wide under the present 
situation. Former Minister Kwon Yong-hae was relieved and 
Minister Yi took office as a result of the shell import 
incident, and the interest of the people, including the supreme 
commander of the military, is so great that Minister Yi is being 
pressed hard to eliminate the people's suspicion on this 
incident. Besides, he is assigned a task to resolve the doubt on 
the Yulgok Project [ROK Army weapons purchase program] and on 
logistic irregularities. 
  Phenomena, far distant from Minister Yi's public pledge, 
already began to appear. In the first meeting with military 
officials on the day of his inauguration, he clearly stated that 
there would be no shocking personnel reshuffle within the 
military. However, he suddenly dismissed two lieutenant 
general-grade officers, including Kim Sang-chun, JCS chief of 
operations; and Yi Taek-hyong, JSC chief of strategy, last 30 
December. They were all members of Hanahoe [a private circle of 
military academy graduates] and were already on the reshuffle 
list last October. However, since a step was taken throughout 
the entire armed forces to strengthen combat readiness through 
March 1994, their replacement is to be withheld until that time. 
Thus, there were many speculations about the change in this 
policy. 
  Lieutenant General Yi reported the greatest amount of 
personal properties among the military general officers during 
the period of official registration of personal properties by 
government officials last September. He has been even suspected 
of real estate speculation. Lt Gen Kim also belonged to the top 
group when the military generals made public their personal 
assets. As a result, some believe that the reshuffle was 
prompted by the disclosure of their assets. The reshuffle 
contradicts some people's speculation that since Minister Yi 
himself is a Hanahoe member, those from Hanahoe will be saved in 
the future, thus attracting public attention. Some are concerned 
with a possibility that the personnel reshuffle to be carried 
out sooner or later in connection with the shell import incident 
will be a large-scale one. 
  Minister Yi is also given a difficult task of figuring out 
how he should accept in the future "the wind" blowing from 
outside forces, including Chongwadae [presidential office], that 
expect reform, regardless of his own will for a reform drive, in 
a way that the military would not fall to pieces [wahae]. He 
also needs to overcome some people's criticism that Minister Yi 
has been merely posturing when he has expressed his will for 
reform over the past two weeks. In conclusion, Minister Yi's 
"clever moves" to overcome such a difficult situation facing the 
military is the target of the people's attention.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 14 (YONHAP) -- Just when the country 
appeared to have run out of hot political issues, drinking water 
contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals gushed out of faucets 
in households in Pusan and other cities along the Naktong River, 
making big waves among government leaders and politicians. 
  President Kim Yong-sam promised Friday that his 
administration will work out short- and long-term measures to 
clean up the country's water resources so that all citizens are 
able to drink safe and clean water. 
  "Government officials should not just follow the inertia of 
the past administrations, but tell environmental and health 
problems to the citizenry," he said, apparently blaming previous 
administrations for today's water pollution. 
  The people, for their part, should actively contribute to 
national efforts to clean up water resources by not dumping 
garbage and liquid waste into rivers, Kim said. 
  Ruling and opposition parties, meanwhile, hastily dispatched 
fact-finding missions to South Kyongsang Province while forming 
party committees to debate the problem. 
  They sharply criticized the administration for leaving the 
state of pollution in the Naktong River as it is today. 
  Both the ruling Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] and main 
opposition Democratic Party [DP] failed, however, to come up 
with any suggestion or alternative action for the administration 
to take immediately. 
  It was the stench emanating from the tap water in homes in 
Pusan and other cities in lower South Kyongsang Province, and 
complaints by citizens that alerted government officials to look 
into the woeful state of pollution of the Naktong River earlier 
this week. 
  Showing the situation to be even worse than feared, 
government officials announced Thursday that they had found 
traces of cancer- causing benzene and other chemicals in the 
Naktong River, from which tap water is drawn, raising grave 
concern among people in the area. 
  The parties have decided that the National Assembly Health 
and Social Affairs Committee will hold a hearing Saturday to 
grill the responsible government officials and try to work out 
measures to clean up the mess. 
  The DLP convened an unscheduled meeting of party postholders 
Friday morning and discussed the problem but could not make any 
concrete suggestion to the government. 
  "I have nothing to announce," DLP spokesman Ha Sun-pong said 
after the meeting. "We just exchanged our concerns. 
  "Right now, the administration is working on measures among 
the ministries concerned," he said. "The party will make an 
overall and comprehensive action plan after listening to them." 
  DLP Secretary-general Mun Chong-su acknowledged that the 
government and ruling party should have done something about the 
Naktong River pollution three years ago, when an industrial 
company was caught dumping phenol into the river. 
  The DLP is resolved, he said, to support the government in 
its efforts to clean up pollution not only in the Naktong but 
all the rivers in the country. 
  The Democratic Party, calling the Naktong River pollution 
the 
worst man-made disaster in the nation's history, demanded that 
the government take fundamental action. 
  "Some 10 million people in southern South Kyongsang Province 
have been drinking water contaminated by cancer-causing 
chemicals," DP spokesman Pak Chi-won said. 
  "The government should trace those responsible for the 
contamination and arrest them immediately while making efforts 
to prevent further pollution," he said. 
  DP members of the Health and Social Affairs Committee will 
use the findings of a party investigation team sent down to the 
area Thursday in questioning government officials. 
  The opposition party, taking the position that the Naktong 
River "disaster" is a direct result of a lack of government 
environmental measures and lack of supervision, pressed again 
its demand for an extraordinary assembly session in January.

  [Text] On 10 and 11 January U.S. Senators Daniel Inouye 
and Ted Stevens, chairman and vice chairman respectively of the 
Defense Subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee, 
paid a visit to Vietnam with four aides. 
  The delegation was received by Dang Quan Thuy, National 
Assembly vice chairman and chairman of the National Assembly 
Defense Committee. The delegation also met Deputy Foreign 
Minister Le Mai, Deputy Trade Minister Ta Ca, and Nguyen Nhac, 
deputy minister chairman of the Cooperation and Investment State 
Commission. During the meetings, Senators Inouye and Stevens 
affirmed that it was time to close the sorrowful page of the 
past in U.S.-Vietnamese relations in order to build a better 
future for the two peoples. They also said that the long-term 
relationship between the two countries should be based on mutual 
understanding, respect, and benefits. 
  The senators also wished that U.S. businessmen would soon 
have opportunity to do business in Vietnam. The delegation also 
expressed concern about the fate of American servicemen missing 
in the war, and thanked the Vietnamese Government and people for 
their positive cooperation in this issue, thus contributing to 
reducing the agony of the American families who have relatives 
missing in the war. The delegation promised to report this 
situation to the U.S. Senate. 
  The delegation left for home on the afternoon of 11 January.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 18 KYODO -- The ruling coalition 
decided Tuesday [18 January] to accept the Liberal Democratic 
Party's [LDP's] call for talks aimed at striking a compromise 
over LDP proposals to modify a government-proposed political 
reform package, its chief negotiator said. 
  Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, told 
reporters 
the coalition will resume bargaining with the LDP over the 
package of four bills designed to revamp Japan's electoral 
system for the House of Representatives and alter political 
fund-raising methods. 
  Ichikawa made the remarks minutes after Yoshiro Mori, 
secretary general of the main opposition LDP, told a news 
conference that the ruling coalition should accept three out of 
the 10 demands it had put forward to the coalition Monday. 
  The first of the three demands calls for increasing the 
number of single-seat lower chamber constituencies from the 
government-proposed 274 to 280 out of a proposed 500-seat 
chamber, while reducing the number of seats to be appropriated 
under proportional representation to 220 from 226. 
  The second is for splitting up a proposed nationwide 
proportional representation constituency for the 220 seats into 
several regional electoral blocs. 
  Political analysts say many LDP legislators fear the package 
might force them to run in alien constituencies located far from 
their home based electoral districts where they have a 
well-cultivated network of supporters. 
  The third demand calls for authorizing business firms to 
hand 
over donations to the fund-raising organizations of individual 
politicians by dropping the proposed legal requirement to unify 
fund-raising channels into a political party. 
  In contrast, the government-proposed bill would obligate 
potential corporate donors to give money to a political party, 
which would then be entrusted with distributing the money to 
individual politicians. 
  Mori said, "If the LDP and the coalition could strike a 
broad 
agreement to accept the three demands, including the bloc-based 
proportional representation constituency, the two camps would 
have to work out, in a next Diet session, the details of 
modifications that may not be hammered out due to technical and 
time constraints." 
  Mori said the LDP leadership would instruct its legislators 
to vote for the government-proposed package in Wednesday's vote 
in a crucial committee of the House of Councillors, if the 
coalition accepted the three demands. 
  The LDP wants to finalize the details of the compromise deal 
in a proposed summit between LDP President Yohei Kono and Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, expected to take place Wednesday, 
LDP sources said. 
  The coalition decided to resume bargaining with the LDP in 
view of a growing number of dissident socialist legislators who 
have remained adamant in rejecting the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) leadership's calls to vote with the coalition, Diet 
sources said. The SDP is the largest in the seven-party 
coalition. 
  Political analysts predicted that if more than 10 SDP 
legislators voted against the reform package in the 252-member 
upper chamber, the package could be rejected. The coalition has 
only a slim majority. 
  The coalition also fears that if it agrees to give too much 
ground to the LDP, it might antagonize the SDP legislators who 
have called for minimizing the number of seats to be contested 
at single-seat constituencies, the sources said. 
  Meanwhile, the leaders of the coalition partners decided to 
try to strike a compromise by arranging a meeting between Juro 
Saito, chief of the group of the LDP's upper chamber 
legislators, and Manzo Hamamoto, Saito's SDP counterpart, 
coalition officials said. 
  If necessary, the officials said, the coalition will seek to 
reconcile differences that may remain unresolved even by the 
Saito-Hamamoto talks, by arranging another bargaining session 
between Mori and Ichikawa or even the summit between Hosokawa 
and Kono. 
  The coalition leaders also confirmed that they will not 
scrap 
their own parliamentary schedule of trying to push the package 
through the upper chamber committee on Wednesday, whatever 
developments might occur at these forums for a compromise. They 
said the coalition will try to push the package through the 
plenary session of the upper chamber by Friday.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 19 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
carries an article headlined "Nuclear Issue of Korean Peninsula 
Must Be Solved Quickly." 
  The author of the article says: 
  Whether the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula is 
resolved 
or not is a matter concerning the survival and ruin of the 
Korean people. 
  It was entirely caused by the U.S. policy of turning South 
Korea into its nuclear base. In July 1957 the U.S. Army 
officially announced the start of the nuclear armament of its 
troops in South Korea. After that nearly all types nuclear 
weapons produced in the United States were deployed in South 
Korea, and their number exceeded 1,000. 
  From 1976 the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises, a test 
nuclear war, have been staged every year in South Korea with 
nuclear weapons hurled into them. 
  Though the U.S. declared the withdrawal of nuclear weapons, 
they are left intact in South Korea. 
  If they are used, the Korean nation will be the first 
sufferer. 
  The nuclear problem of the Korean peninsula must be solved 
soon for peace and security in Asia and the world. 
  The United States is using the nuclear weapons as the main 
means of executing its dominationist policy. The nuclear weapons 
in South Korea can not be an exception. 
  If the nuclear issue becomes acute on the Korean peninsula 
and nuclear weapons are used, many countries would suffer the 
holocaust. 
  The nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula can be solved only 
through dialogue and negotiation between the DPRK and the USA. 
  It will be fundamentally solved, if the third-round DPRK-USA 
talks are opened with sincere will of dialogue and fair attitude 
toward talks and the formula of package deal is adopted there, 
as agreed upon at the contact on December 29 last year.

<F P=106> [Article by Nam Yu-chol: "Even If Nuclear Issues Were </F>
Resolved, North-South Economic Cooperation Is Far Away"] 
  [Text] Expectations and concern over the North-South 
economic cooperation are mounting again now that a hint of a 
solution of North Korea's nuclear issue can be seen. This is 
because it is expected that in the case that North Korea's 
nuclear issues were completely resolved, the actual improvement 
of North-South relations would bring a brisk North-South 
economic cooperation. The government has even revealed on 
several occasions that if the nuclear issues were resolved, it 
would press ahead with economic cooperation with North Korea. A 
government official said that "entrepreneurs have already 
telephoned the government authorities to ask about the 
procedures for visiting North Korea." 
  The general expectation that the solution of the nuclear 
issues will lay a foundation for North-South dialogue and, then, 
this would bring a brisk North-South economic cooperation is 
confirmed in the stock markets. As foreign news reports that 
progress is being made in the U.S.-North Korean negotiations 
over the nuclear issues are coming out everyday, stock markets 
have been vibrant with the dealings of stocks related with 
business with northern countries from the beginning of the new 
year. 
  However, the view of business circles and experts is 
overwhelmingly cautious over the era "after the nuclear issues 
are resolved." They believe that even if nuclear issues were 
resolved, to think that North-South economic cooperation would 
be brisk is yet premature. Many experts believe that a 
full-fledged North-South economic cooperation, which requires 
the considerable improvement in political relations, will take a 
lot of time. 
  By analyzing data, the Korean Trade Promotion Corporation 
[Kotra] has recently estimated that even if North Korea were to 
open up, it is very likely that its opening policy may incline 
toward the U.S. or Japanese sides rather than the ROK side. The 
KOTRA held that because economic cooperation with the ROK has 
been stagnant for the past two years, North Korea has worked out 
a policy of turning the direction of economic cooperation to the 
United States and Japan. There is a view that the abrupt 
dismissal of Kim Tal-hyon, former vice premier and chairman of 
the State Planning Committee, last December was a strategy to 
exclude the ROK enterprises from bringing foreign investments in 
the future. Kim Tal-hyon, who held actual power out of those 
favoring opening, was a channel for most ROK enterprises to 
promote North-South economic cooperation. A conglomerate's 
official, who is in charge of business with North Korea, said 
that "there will be great difficulties in trade with North Korea 
as a result of Kim's dismissal." 
  Experts point out that, in addition to the fact that North 
Korea's investment legislation, systems, and other investment 
conditions are not tangible and are incomplete, there are still 
many stumbling blocks to full-fledgedly investing in North Korea 
in light of pure economics. An official from business circles 
said: "Many believe that to think that if North Korea's nuclear 
issues were resolved North-South economic cooperation would 
proceed smoothly, is a very simplistic idea. North Korea does 
not want the ROK enterprises to independently enter the Najin 
and Sonbong free trade districts." This bespeaks that the 
solution of the nuclear issue means North Korea's return to the 
time when it had not withdrawn from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty. 
<H3>  Holding Investment-Explanation Meetings in the United 
States, Europe, and Hong Kong </H3>
  However, there is a view that because the issue of 
establishing diplomatic relations with the United States and 
Japan is being discussed in connection with the solution of 
nuclear issues, the solution of North Korea's nuclear issues 
will bring about a change at a new level. In particular, 
because North Korea admitted its failure in its economic fields 
and is making positive efforts to attract foreign investment, 
the expectation that there is a new turn in North-South economic 
cooperation in the near future is mounting. That is, even though 
this may take time, if the ROK assumes a farsighted attitude, 
North Korea will be eventually forced to come out and improve 
relations through economic cooperation. Kim To-hyang, 
researcher of the Lucky-Goldstar Economic Research Institute, 
said that "North Korea may try to exclude the ROK enterprises 
and to trade with foreign enterprises for the time being to 
maintain its system. However, it is difficult for North Korea 
to exclude the ROK enterprises on a mid- and long-term basis." 
It is believed that it is actually difficult for North Korea to 
trade with foreign enterprises alone because North Korea has no 
special attractions for foreign enterprises to invest there. 
  It is difficult to predict the position North Korea will 
assume in the economic exchange with the ROK. North Korea 
enacted for the first time in 1984 the joint venture 
legislation, which stipulates the regulations on joint venture 
with foreign enterprises. Since then, North Korea has steadily 
attempted to attract foreign capital. North Korea has made more 
contacts with foreign enterprises than the ROK experts thought. 
North Korea held investment-explanation meetings in the United 
States and Europe early last year. Kim Chong-u, vice chairman 
of the External Economic Committee, personally held an 
investment-explanation meeting in Hong Kong last September. 
According to informed sources, it is said that he will visit 
China and East Asia to promote foreign investments. 
  (Tony Misel), representative of a British consulting 
company, 
who personally held an investment-explanation meeting in Hong 
Kong last September, revealed that approximately 30 enterprises, 
which were then banned from investing in North Korea, attended 
the meeting. He said his clients are interested in investing in 
North Korea and added that the enterprises are global 
multinational ones, ranking among the world's top 500 
enterprises selected every year by the U.S. economic magazine 
FORTUNE. 
  Of course, even though they are interested in investing in 
North Korea they will not all invest in North Korea at once. An 
official in Hong Kong, who attended the Hong Kong 
investment-explanation meeting, said that "Out of the 
enterprises attending the investment-explanation meeting, 
practically no enterprises will actually invest in North Korea." 
For example, Nestle, a Swiss multinational foodstuffs company, 
has reviewed for a few years the possibility of investing in 
North Korea, but it has not invested anything there. The 
official in Hong Kong said that the greatest concern of most 
foreign enterprises on investing in North Korea is the concern 
the management of the multinational enterprises have in looking 
at the next 20-30 years. 
  An official of Germany's East Asian Association (OAV), 
established to promote exchanges between German enterprises and 
24 Asian-Pacific countries, including North Korea, revealed 
that: "Some German conglomerates and small- and medium-sized 
enterprises have concluded contracts with North Korea recently. 
However, the amount of money is not large. The contracts were 
to provide machine parts mainly exported by the former East 
Germany." The official, who refused to be identified, said 
during a telephone interview that "The main reason trade between 
Germany and North Korea does not increase is that North Korea 
lacks hard currency." North Korea is currently indebted with a 
considerable number of German enterprises. Frequently, many 
enterprises from European countries, including Sweden which has 
promoted relatively brisk economic exchanges with North Korea, 
keep dealing with North Korea because of the loans that North 
Korea has not paid back. 
<H3>  There have been approximately 160 investments, at the most, 
that North Korea has attracted between 1984 and 1992 </H3>
  Samsung Economic Research Institute estimated that since 
North Korea enacted the joint venture law in September 1984, 
North Korea has attracted approximately 160 foreign investments, 
at the most, by the end of May 1992. It is said that most of 
the 160 foreign investments were the result of investments made 
by pro-General Association of the Korean Residents in Japan 
enterprises and by U.S.-resident Korean compatriots. The 
research institute views that, comparing North Korea's 
investment conditions with those of China and Vietnam, North 
Korea's competitiveness is not strong. Kal Yong-sung, senior 
researcher of the Samsung Economic Research Institute, analyzed 
that "North Korea's efforts to attract investment may draw 
attention in view of its taxation system but other conditions 
are worse." He affirmed that "it is almost impossible for North 
Korea to succeed in attracting investments through its current 
methods." He held that even though foreign investments of all 
kinds seem to be possible in view of the legislation, North 
Korea's strategy for attracting investments greatly favors a 
joint venture-type processing-for-wages-trade work [hapchak 
hyongtaeui imgagong saop], which prevents foreign investors from 
having actual management and ownership rights. Japanese experts 
point out that the worsening of North Korea's energy shortages 
is another barrier. North Korea's efforts to attract Western 
refinery companies in Najin and Sonbong free trade districts 
will be impossible without a steady supply of electricity. 
  The tangible economic line of Hong Sok-hyong, 
newly-appointed chairman of North Korea's State Planning 
Committee equivalent to the minister of the ROK Economic and 
Planning Board, has yet to be revealed. Experts believe that 
North Korea's line to positively promote foreign investment in 
Najin and Sonbong free trade districts will not be changed. 
North Korea has positively promoted the construction of Najin 
and Sonbong free trade districts as a part of the Tumen 
development work led by the UN Development Program (UNDP), 
because North Korea views that this is the best way to realize 
its two targets, maintaining its system and earning foreign 
currency. In particular, since it is the United States that has 
actually promoted the UNDP behind the scenes, it is much clearer 
that North Korea has more significantly promoted this work in a 
bid to realize its greatest target of improving relations with 
the United States. 
  North Korea has conducted economic projects six times since 
the fifties. However, there has not been a time when North 
Korea officially admitted its failure of attaining its target. 
Nevertheless, on last 8 December, North Korea admitted, for the 
first time since the Republic was founded, it had failed to 
attain the target of the Third Seven-Year Plan (87-93). North 
Korea itself made a report that the production increase rate on 
a yearly average remained at 5.6 percent, much lower than its 
target of 7.9 percent. However, the ROK experts view that North 
Korea has actually not attained 40 percent of its target. North 
Korea's economy is officially in a difficult situation.

  [Text] The government gave an emergency order on 14 
January to the ROK Embassy in Japan to grasp the truth of the 
irregular export of spectrum analyzers, which are core parts for 
missile development, from Japan to North Korea. 
  The Foreign Ministry said that it should be clarified 
whether 
or not the spectrum analyzers claimed to have been exported by 
Japanese companies are items regulated by the Coordinating 
Committee for Multilateral Export Controls [Cocom], and that it 
could be possible that North Korea imported them as simple 
electronic products and used them as missile parts and ordered 
the embassy in Japan to investigate the truth.

<F P=106> [YONHAP report from Tokyo] </F>
  [Text] Quoting a high-ranking official of the Russian 
Pacific Fleet Command, Japan's TOKYO SHIMBUN reported that in 
addition to exporting four submarines to North Korea, Russia 
concluded a contract to sell 10 submarines to North Korea. 
  According to this official, the contract to export the 
submarines was concluded at the North Korean Consulate in 
Nakhodka. He also revealed that Russia's export company is the 
(Dariol) Company, which sells submarines by salvaging the ones 
that have sunk in the Far East area or that are being kept by 
submerging them at sea. 
  The (Dariol) Company received permission to export the 
submarines in accordance with the plan to reduce the Pacific 
Fleet's weapons. However, permission must be officially received 
by the central government to export the submarines as they are, 
without changing the structure of the vessels. The TOKYO 
SHIMBUN reported that, therefore, an alternate method will be 
used. A Russian vessel will tow the submarines to the North 
Korean side.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 17 (YONHAP) -- Russia signed a contract 
to sell North Korea 10 Golf II class submarines not long after 
it exported four Fox-Trot class submarines to the communist 
country, a senior official of the Russian Pacific Fleet Command 
is quoted as saying in a report by the TOKYO SHIMBUN. 
  North Korea made the deal at its consulate in Nakhodka with 
a 
company that sells submarines it has salvaged from the sea, 
according to the dispatch from Russian fleet headquarters in 
Vladivostok. 
  Although the company has a permit to export submarines under 
the Pacific Fleet's arms reduction plan, it needs formal 
approval from the central government to sell intact submarines. 
  In an abnormal procedure, the submarines are likely to be 
towed by Russian warships to North Korea to escape inspection by 
customs officers, the vernacular Japanese paper said. 
  Once the submarines leave Russian waters, they will be 
handed 
over to North Korean ships for the rest of their journey to 
Chongjin, the daily said. 
  The Golf II submarines are similiar to the Fox-Trot types in 
size, but excel them in speed and cruising range and can carry 
three SS-N-5 ballistic missiles. 
  They were sold for 130 U.S. dollars a ton, with the total 
2,126 tons selling at 276,000 dollars. They were initially for 
sale to a Japanese company, but went to North Korea after the 
first contract was called off, the TOKYO SHIMBUN said. 
  The Russian Navy officially confirmed earlier the sale of 
four Fox-Trot submarines to North Korea, which have reportedly 
been delivered through a Japanese trader. It added that the 
sales were under condition that North Korea use the vessels for 
scrap.

  [Text] It has been learned that the U.S. Government is 
demanding that our government and North Korea make the "Joint 
Declaration on Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" an 
international treaty lest they possess nuclear reprocessing 
facilities. 
  A relevant government official on 16 January said that "the 
United States supported making the Joint Declaration on 
Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula an international treaty 
which will ensure that the nuclear states assign obligation to 
North and South Korea for denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula and in return for this, they will supply on a stable 
basis nuclear materials required for the development of atomic 
energy." 
  This official said: The Joint Declaration on 
Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, which was signed on 31 
December 1991 and effectuated in February 1992, stipulates that 
North and South Korea shall not possess nuclear reprocessing 
facilities. However, since North Korea did not comply with it, 
and in the event that its content is revised according to an 
agreement reached by the North and the South, there is a 
possibility for both sides to possess nuclear reprocessing 
facilities. It is likely that the United States is concerned 
with this situation. 
  It was learned that the government has not decided on the 
policy up to date to cope with such a proposal by the United 
States. 
  The U.S. proposal directly contradicts the allegation of 
some 
national assemblymen and scientists who call for recovery of 
nuclear sovereignty by possessing nuclear reprocessing 
facilities with peaceful purposes. As a result, heated 
controversy will likely be touched off in the future. 
  The incumbent Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] 
prescribes that one is allowed to possess a nuclear reprocessing 
facility but should declare the quantity and purpose of 
plutonium extracted from it, and this quantity and purpose are 
subject to inspection and supervision. 
  Therefore, an expert pointed out that the demand that North 
and South Korea turn their declaration into an international 
treaty which does not allow them to possess a nuclear 
reprocessing facility itself, contradicts the principle of 
international laws. He assumed that this proposal was prompted 
by the fact that suspicion of North Korea's development of 
nuclear weapons has become an international issue. 
  At present, there is no international treaty, other than the 
NPT, which restricts a certain state or district from nuclear 
development. 
  Another government official stated that "in the event that 
the declaration on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is 
turned into an international treaty, it will be greatly helpful 
to complete the resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue and 
to win trust from international society concerning the nuclear 
policies of North and South Korea." 
  He added: However, even if we want to possess nuclear 
facilities after the North Korean nuclear issue is completely 
resolved and the trust of the international community in nuclear 
policies of the North and South is built with the declaration 
turned to into an international treaty, we should have consent 
from nuclear states. Therefore, this proposal would be, in 
actuality, impossible.

  [Text] The government has decided to oppose a measure 
promoted by the United States of turning a joint declaration of 
the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula into an 
international treaty in an effort to block North Korea's nuclear 
development. 
  On 17 January an official concerned of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs said that "a joint declaration of the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is not an act between 
countries [kukka kanui haengwi] and it is, therefore, impossible 
to turn it into an international treaty," adding "the issue of 
nuclear reprocessing facilities on the Korean peninsula should 
be solved between North and South Korea." 
  The official continued: "The government's policy is that if 
the radiochemical laboratory North Korea possesses now turns out 
to be a small-scale nuclear reprocessing facility it will 
persuade North Korea, through the North-South Joint Nuclear 
Control Committee, to close the facility and abide by the joint 
declaration of denuclearization."

  [Text] The United States once studied a possibility of 
making the inter-Korean agreement on denuclearization of the 
Korean Peninsula a more binding international treaty as a way to 
force North Korea to give up its nuclear program, but dropped it 
soon after, a Foreign Ministry official said yesterday. 
  He said the plan was discussed among some U.S. officials 
soon 
after North Korea declared to leave the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty (NPT) on March 12, 1993. 
  But Seoul and Washington have never discussed the plan 
together, formally or informally, the official said. Neither 
has the United States suggested to Seoul such a plan, he said. 
  He said the U.S. Government did not adopt the policy because 
there were doubts about its effectiveness in making North Korea 
withdraw its decision to leave the NPT. 
  Seoul's position on this matter is that the joint 
declaration 
on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula which was signed 
between the two Koreas on Dec. 31, 1991, was primarily a promise 
between the two, the official said. 
  It believes that more important at this stage is to reopen 
the suspended Joint Nuclear Control Commission (JNCC) to discuss 
implementation of the declaration, he said. 
  Moreover, an additional procedure to make the declaration an 
international treaty may not be necessary because the United 
Nations has already mentioned the declaration in its resolutions 
concerning the North Korean matter, he said. 
  The official, however, agreed on a possibility that the 
United States and South Korea may differ on this matter because 
of their different viewpoints on the North Korean nuclear matter. 
  While Washington's primary concern is to have Pyongyang give 
up its nuclear weapons development program using all available 
means, Seoul needs to be more cautious as it is a matter 
concerning the fate of the nation, he said. 
  The inter-Korean declaration on denuclearization of the 
Korean Peninsula which took effect on Feb. 19, 1992, requires 
the two Koreas not to possess nuclear reprocessing or uranium 
enrichment facilities. 
  This prohibition of nuclear reprocessing and enrichment 
facilities has caused a serious debate inside South Korea since 
then and many conservatives in the country are still calling for 
a review of the declaration. 
  They, most of all, insist that the South, which produces 
some 
50 percent of its electricity using nuclear power plants, needs 
nuclear reprocessing plants for economic and technological 
reasons rather than for strategic reasons. 
  Quoting a high-ranking government source, a local daily 
reported yesterday that the United States is demanding the South 
agree to making the inter-Korean declaration an international 
treaty, where the two Koreas are guaranteed stable supply of 
nuclear fuel in return for giving up nuclear reprocessing 
facilities.

<F P=106> [From the "News Behind the News" column] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu came to the [Foreign 
Ministry] press room on 17 January and strongly denied reports 
that the United States was pressing the government to change the 
declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula into 
an international treaty by saying that "the contents are 
exaggerated." 
  Minister Han explained that "after North Korea withdrew from 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in March last year, some 
U.S. officials suggested that such a measure may be possible. 
However, no further discussion or exchange of propositions 
between the ROK and U.S. Governments have taken place." 
  This incident is known to have developed from Minister Han's 
slip in a discussion held on 14 January in which he said, 
"Although the United States feels that the denuclearization 
declaration should become an international treaty, the 
prevailing opinion in the ROK is that there should be room left 
to possess nuclear reprocessing facilities." 
  Regarding this remark, Minister Han explained with 
embarrassment, "I answered that way thinking that it would be 
too beautifying to simply say `no' when asked whether there was 
any difference in opinion between the ROK and the United States 
on the nuclear issue, and I meant that such may be a 
possibility."

<F P=106> [By reporter Chi Chae-won] </F>
  [Excerpts] "... I have had inseparable ties with Korea 
since my first visit in 1947." [passage omitted] 
  This is part of the address--delivered in Korean--by James 
T. 
Laney, 66, the new U.S. ambassador to Korea, at a "welcome 
reception" held in his honor at Hyatt Hotel on 5 November. His 
Korean was impeccable except that he pronounced "Hanguk" [Korea] 
like "Hank'uk" and "yeoro kaji" [various or many] like "yoro 
kaji." [passage omitted] 
  About 20 days later, on 2 July, the White House officially 
announced the appointment of Laney. After the Senate 
confirmation process, the new ambassador presented his 
credentials to President Kim Yong-sam on 2 November. Thus, he 
embarked on his ambassadorial activity 4 months after the White 
House announcement. That day, President Kim asked him "when we 
met in the past, did you think that someday I would be the 
president and you would be the ambassador to Korea?" Ambassador 
Laney responded, "I thought that you would someday be the 
president but I never thought of myself to be the ambassador." 
The president laughed. 
  The 5 November reception, held under the auspices of the 
Methodist Church Headquarters of Korea, was attended by some 350 
guests invited from political, business, Christian and academic 
communities. [passage omitted] It was unusually quick that a 
private-level reception in honor of a new U.S. ambassador was 
held 15 days after his arrival and only 3 days after he 
presented his credentials, and that it was attended by so many 
"private" guests as well as public officials. [passage omitted] 
  Addressing the reception, Pyo Yong-un [Methodist Church 
Headquarters Superintendent] said that "It was exciting when we 
heard the news about Dr Laney--whom we love and respect--coming 
as the ambassador." Expressing his hopes, Pyo stated that "Dr 
Laney loves Korea and his relationship with us has a long 
history. His arrival as U.S. ambassador to Korea means a 
tremendous contribution to furthering friendship between the two 
nations and to their attaining the common goal." 
  Among the guests that day were, from the Administration, Kim 
Chol-su, minister of trade, industry and resources; Yi Min-sop, 
minister of culture and sports; Hwang San-song, minister of 
environment; Song Yong- tae, vice minister of the Unification 
Board, and Yi Hong-ku, vice chairman of the Advisory Council for 
Democratic Peaceful Unification, and from the political circles, 
Assemblymen Yi Se-ki, Yi Chae-hwan, Son Hak-kyu and Pak Hui-pu 
of the Democratic Liberal Party [DLP], Yi U- chong, Cho 
Sun-sung, Pak Sil of the Democratic Party [DP], and Kim 
Chong-kil, chairman of the United People's Party [UPP], Yun 
Yong-tak and Yim Chun-won, independents. The guests also 
included Yi Chol-sung and Min Kwan-sik, senior politicians; Yi 
Tae-yong, director of the Family Legal Information Center; Cho 
Kyong-hui, chief director of the Palace of Arts; Cho Sang-ho, 
former minister of sports; Kim Yong-nae, former Seoul mayor; Yi 
Yong-tok, chairman of the government's Public Officials Ethics 
Committee, and Yi Se-chung, chairman of the Korea Bar 
Association. The Rev. Mun Ik-wan and the Rev. Pak Hyong-kyu, 
both chaeya [reformist camp] veterans, were also 
present, drawing attention. Mun Ik-hwan has known Laney since 
the 1960's when the latter was a missionary in Korea. "I am very 
happy to have as the U.S. ambassador a person who knows about 
Korea better than any other Americans," Mun said. [passage 
omitted] 
  Deputy Prime Minister Han Wan-sang, who some newspapers 
reported was the prime mover for the gathering, was not present. 
Explaining, he said that "for reasons involving the strained 
North-South relations, I could not attend the reception. I 
expressed my regret to the office of superintendent of the 
Methodist Church Headquarters. I am sure that for our deep 
friendship, Ambassador Laney would understand it." 
  Han drew most attention from media when the Laney 
appointment 
was announced. The relationship of the two dates back to the 
early 1970's when Han was a chaeya activist and the 
general manager of the Christian Professors Conference, a group 
of critical intellectuals. He read a declaration on the state of 
the country at a gathering held on 1 March 1975 to welcome Kim 
Tong-kil and Kim Chan-kuk of the group who were just released 
form prison. As he actively participated in pro- democracy 
movements, the relationship deepened, Han says. 
  "It was my days of sufferings. I was arrested and detained 
several times. With humane concerns for me in that situation, Mr 
Laney did many things to help me. When I was taken into custody 
again in 1980, he, then president of Emory U., led an effort for 
arranging my U.S. visit. On my release in November that year, I 
was invited to Emory U. as an exchange professor. I stayed on 
until I returned to my position in Seoul National University 
[SNU] in September 1984. During the years, Mr Laney looked after 
my family, too, with the greatest possible care." 
  Deputy Prime Minister Han describes Ambassador Laney as a 
"man of the oriental sense of love and humanity." In addition, 
as his tremendous accomplishments for Emory U. show, Han says, 
he is known for his outstanding administrative ability. As 
ambassador, he will "play a great role in furthering Korea-U.S. 
relations," he adds, "because he loves our country and has his 
unique experience in contributing to its democracy." 
  Han saw Laney in July during his U.S. visit to attend an 
information exchange meeting. At the time, Laney, then the 
ambassador designate, reportedly said to Han that "From now on, 
I will be working for the national interests of the United 
States and you are in the position to work for the national 
interests of Korea. But let's cooperate, relying on God's will." 
Han, who is also a faithful Presbyterian, denied the reported 
references to "national interests." They only shared 
conversations on "cooperating for the peace, well-being and 
unification of the Korean Peninsula," he said. 
  Pak Pong-pae, 62, president of Mogwon U., is known to have 
done the actual work of arranging the Laney reception. A 
graduate of MTC, Pak studied at Boston U., and later at 
Vanderbilt U., taking his master's and doctor's degrees there. 
  Pak says: "I first met the Rev. Laney in 1959, when I was 
living in a missionary's home to learn about American life to 
prepare for my study in the United States. One day the 
missionary told me that `a new missionary has come from the 
United States. Let's go and see him.' That was Rev. Laney. I saw 
him in the missionary's quarters called "Guest House" in West 
Gate. We felt close friendship with each other the minute we 
met. We have since been like real brothers." 
  On his return to Korea, Pak found a position as an MTC 
professor. After serving as its rector, he became the president 
of Mogwon U. He continued to invite Laney to Korea all these 
years. [passage omitted] 
  On the relationship between President Kim Yong-sam and 
Ambassador Laney, Pak Pong-pae says: 
  "President Kim visited Emory U., in 1984 or 85 in my memory. 
I was then working there as an exchange professor. It was the 
first time they met each other. Mr Laney invited President Kim, 
then leader of an opposition party, to a dinner at his 
residence. Also, under arrangements made by him, President Kim 
made a speech to students under the title "Democratization of 
Korea." When Mr Laney visited Korea in early 1990, he was 
scheduled to see Kim Yong-sam, then chairman of the DLP but the 
meeting did not materialize because the later was in Masan in 
the aftermath of a political upheaval touched off by a 
memorandum concerning the controversial cabinet system plan. I 
understand that Ambassador Laney is deeply impressed by 
President Kim's leadership and reform program." 
  Pak also said that he understands that Laney's relationship 
with former DP President Kim Tae-chung has become increasingly 
closer since the Kim Tae-chung kidnapping incident. Laney was 
particularly concerned over the incident. Emory conferred an 
honorary doctorate in law on Kim in June 1983. It also gave his 
son, Hong-kol, an opportunity to study at the university. Deputy 
Prime Minister Han Wan-sang's two daughters and former Rep. Mun 
Tong-hwan's son also studied at Emory through the good offices 
of Ambassador Laney. [passage omitted] 
  In terms of school ties alone, Yi Hong-ku [First Vice 
Chairman of the Advisory Council for Democratic Peaceful 
Unification] is closest to Laney. He was once Emory professor 
and even received an honorary doctorate in literature. Moreover, 
Yi served as chairman of the Yale alumni association in Korea 
for 10 years. Yale is Laney's alma mater. [passage omitted] 
  According to him, Laney is "a liberal who has long been 
showing a great deal of concern about democratization and human 
rights." His arrival as U.S. ambassador, he says, should be 
viewed as meaning the opening of a new era in Korea-U.S. 
relations. 
  He continued: "Democratization, human rights, the Cold 
War--all these things are over now. U.S. ambassadors to Korea in 
the past were all specialists in security. The fact itself that 
a scholar, not a career diplomat, was appointed to that post 
shattered the tradition. As in the case of Mondale, the 
ambassador to Japan, the Laney appointment suggests that the 
U.S. Government attaches greater importance to Korea. Korea- 
U.S. relations have entered a 'new era,' I believe." 
  Meanwhile, among Laney's circles of acquaintances in Korea, 
there is a group almost unknown to the public but very 
deep-rooted and thriving in every way. It is Club VV--VV stands 
for veneratio vitae in Latin meaning "reverence for life." It is 
a group of Christian students assembled to uphold the great 
spirit of Dr Albert Schweitzer, who was a physician, missionary, 
philosopher, musician and writer. Currently, its graduate 
members alone number more than 900. In particular, all the 
80-odd members from the early days are still meeting regularly, 
they say. The representative of the graduate chapter is Prof. 
Chon Se-il of Yonsei U., who is the director of the 
rehabilitation clinic of the university hospital. [passage 
omitted] 
  Laney, seeing the club as a kind of "spiritual movement," 
has 
continued to show great interest in it since his arrival this 
time. Chairman Chon Se-il explains that he is doing so because 
the club's activities conform to his thought and philosophy. 
  Club VV has its office in Miju Plaza Building in Kuro-tong, 
Seoul. They are said to be planning to start a new group led by 
graduate members before the year-end. 
  The Laney network also includes the Korean Student Christian 
Council (KSCC). Among its leading figures are O Chae-sik, former 
director of the WCC [World Council of Churches] Third Bureau; 
Kang Mun-kyu, YMCA secretary general; Pak Sang-chung, director 
of the Korea Institute of Christian Social Affairs. [passage 
omitted] 
  O Chae-sik, graduate of the SNU religious department, left 
Korea together with the Rev. Laney in 1964, the latter's 
sabbatical year. Then, they both studied in Yale U. graduate 
school of theology, Laney in the doctor's course and O Chae-sik 
in the master's. O continues: 
  "At the time, the Rev. Laney told me that he would not 
return 
to Korea at the end of his sabbatical leave. His judgement was 
that churches in Korea had grown and no longer needed the help 
of missionaries. He said that he would help Korea working in the 
United States. And he kept his word." 
  On his return home 2 years later, O Chae-sik joined YMCA and 
took part in the effort for the merger of KSCM and the YMCA and 
YWCA college chapters. The three groups were finally merged and 
KSCF (Korea Student Christian Federation) was born in 1968. O 
Chae-sik became the head of its secretariat. Laney was greatly 
helpful in this process, O recalled. 
  Subsequently, O Chae-sik served as director of the training 
center of the Korea National Council of Churches (NCC-K) and 
director of the international department of the Asian Council of 
Churches. Then, after serving successively as the director of 
the WCC Development Bureau and its Third Bureau in Geneva since 
1988, he returned to Korea in June. 
  According to O, it is true that Laney greatly contributed to 
the founding of KSCF but had no particular relationship with 
WCC. He says: 
  "Even after he left Korea 30 years ago, the Rev. Laney has 
always been with us. And he has shown more concern and affection 
for the young people rather than the older generation. He always 
inspired them with courage, helping them with all he had 
whenever they needed help while expecting nothing in return. In 
the past, he had close friends among Korean politicians and 
chaeya personages, sometimes giving them a helping 
hand. I believe that it was a natural thing for him coming from 
his faith. As an ambassador now, he is assigned a political 
role. I am hoping wholeheartedly that he will be able to fully 
display his strength in that capacity, too." [passage omitted] 
  There is a joke in diplomatic quarters: "An ambassador would 
not even tee off on a golf course without first getting an 
instruction from his home government." The message is that all 
ambassadors are expected to act as instructed by their home 
governments and work in the interests of their respective 
countries. As public attention is concentrated on the new U.S. 
ambassador, Mr "L," a diplomat in active service, warns that 
there is a need for people to view things in a more cool-headed 
manner. A Korean worker at the U.S. Embassy also says that "the 
arrival of a pro-Korean personality as the ambassador does not 
mean a change in the basic U.S. policy or position." [passage 
omitted] 
  The well known Laney network in Korea is apparently 
dominated 
by Christians. His acquaintances in political and business 
circles are mostly Christians. Considering that he had been a 
minister--he retired from clergy prior to taking his 
ambassadorial post--and that he had worked as a missionary, it 
is a natural outcome. But how he will cope with the fact will 
also be noteworthy. 
  On the day he presented his credentials, there was an 
anti-U.S., Molotov cocktail-throwing demonstration in Kwangju, 
the first since the launching of the Kim Yong-sam government. 
The unresolved nuclear issue and the remaining anti-U.S. 
sentiment are the major tasks confronting Ambassador Laney. 
[passage omitted] 
  As for the successive U.S. ambassadors to Korea in the past, 
Koreans have a negative image of them all. The biggest reason is 
that they behaved as if they were the "governor general" sent to 
this country. The rulers of the military dictatorial regimes in 
the past--which the people never recognized as truly 
legitimate--were compelled to depend heavily on the United 
States to keep their regimes in power, no matter whether they 
liked it or not. Consequently, one cannot deny that they were 
more or less responsible for the role of the U.S. ambassador 
that "departed from its normal path." Any U.S. ambassador coming 
to Korea--even if he was not an ex-CIA official--perhaps could 
not but involve himself in interference with Korea's domestic 
affairs and covert operations. 
  A known political figure says that the U.S. foreign policy 
toward Korea has been "blank." What he means is that Washington 
was barred from the normal conduct of foreign policy toward a 
dictatorial regime and, as a result, Korea remained nothing more 
than a military strategic region more under the sway of the 
Pentagon rather than that of the State Department--and a void as 
far as foreign policy was concerned. 
  The launching of the civilian government has, in effect, 
paved the way for the office of U.S. ambassador to recover its 
"normal" role. It means that Ambassador Laney's role will 
inevitably be different from the one his predecessors played. 
Therefore, it can be said that ratings on Ambassador Laney are 
linked directly with the question of how much Korea will improve 
its status as a U.S. foreign policy partner.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Negotiations on North Korean Nuclear Issue and </F>
Counterattack by U.S. Conservatives"] 
  [Text] Former cabinet members of U.S. Republican 
administrations leveled acute criticism at the Clinton 
administration's negotiations with North Korea. Research 
organizations of the U.S. conservative camp and some major 
newspapers presented issues concerning the Clinton 
administration's attitude in negotiations with North Korea. This 
is indeed a noteworthy phenomenon. 
  Expressing doubt also on North Korea's attitude, former 
cabinet members of the U.S. Republican administrations showed, 
in particular, a sensitive response to the issue of suspending 
the Team Spirit exercise. They stressed strong defense of the 
ROK from the threat of a southward invasion by North Korea and 
maintained that the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces Command exercise is 
an indispensable course for defense. They are worried even more 
about North Korea's conventional military power. This being the 
case, they advise that the ROK-U.S. joint military exercise 
should be maintained and the ROK's defense capabilities should 
be strengthened to defend the ROK from any attack -- nuclear or 
conventional. 
  Should one assess their opinions as merely the "Hawks'" 
theory? The seriousness of the problem, however, is that judging 
from the current trend of the U.S. press, their logic is not 
regarded merely as the opposition harping on the Clinton 
administration's foreign policy. Emphatically pointing out the 
strengthened conventional military power in the Asian-Pacific 
region, Japan's suggestion to reconsider its own nonnuclear 
policy, and China's weapons exports, they went so far as to 
recommend implementation of a security-first policy in the 
Asian-Pacific area, instead of a foreign policy of attaching 
importance to economics, which may only touch off trade disputes. 
  If we accept their allegation even in part, we would come to 
realize the seriousness of the security situation in the 
Asian-Pacific area. Thus, they pointed out that significant 
political and economic relations should be open to North Korea 
only when it takes concrete steps to reduce its threat to the 
Korean peninsula and the surrounding areas. They even proposed a 
plan to promote trade relations between the United States and 
China with a view to encouraging China to participate actively 
in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue and in removing 
North Korea's military threat. 
  It is indeed alarming that the U.S. conservative camp, 
including former cabinet members of U.S. Republican 
administrations, began to launch a counterattack as the third 
round of North Korean-U.S. talks are about to take place. This 
is even more true in view of the differences in views revealed 
among intelligence organizations within the Clinton 
administration, including the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, 
the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the U.S. State Department. 
The U.S. intelligence organizations assess that North Korea has 
already manufactured one or two nuclear bombs, even though of 
crude condition, or the date of manufacture is imminent. The 
U.S. Department of State, however, disputes this assertion. 
  As the situation is in disorder in the United States, which 
is carrying on nuclear negotiations with North Korea, it is 
quite natural for our government, which is maintaining a joint 
cooperation system with the Department of State, to be cautious. 
What if North Korea, while dragging out nuclear negotiations, 
nearly completes the manufacture of nuclear weapons and then 
initiates the work of hiding them in deep underground tunnels? 
How should we cope with a threat of attack by conventional 
weapons after suspending the Team Spirit exercise? 
  The more serious problem is that even after the exchange of 
special envoys is realized, the envoy [from the North] may 
possibly propose the Koryo confederal system. In this event, is 
it desirable that we declare the suspension of the Team Spirit 
exercise to him as a partner? Indeed, this is a difficult 
problem. We have no other words than our hope that the North and 
the South make appropriate judgments regarding the situation.

  [Text] Concerning the method for resumption of North-South 
dialogue, the government will induce North Korea to make a 
proposal for dialogue first, rather than the South's side making 
a proposal. This was learned on 16 January. 
  The government discussed this with relevant officials from 
the U.S. side and agreed that the United States would induce 
North Korea to propose a working-level contact for the exchange 
of special envoys between the North and the South when the 
negotiation for nuclear inspection between North Korea and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] is completed and when 
a contact is held between the United States and North Korea for 
an agreement on the date of the third round of talks. 
  A relevant government official said that since the North 
side 
refused the contact for the exchange of special envoys last 
year, it is natural that North Korea should propose the 
resumption of dialogue first, referring to remarks by Deputy 
Prime Minister and Unification Minister Yi Yong-tok who stressed 
that "we should not propose dialogue to the North merely for the 
sake of dialogue and should face the North in a dignified 
manner."

<F P=106> [Interview with ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu by KBS </F>
commentator Yi Chong-su and CHOSON ILBO editorial writer Kim 
Hyong-kon from the program "KBS Diagnosis of Policies"--live] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Kim Hyong-kon] The greatest 
pending issue in our diplomacy last year was the North Korean 
nuclear issue. However, with the beginning of the new year, a 
sign for the solution of the problem has appeared. North Korea 
reportedly said that it will accept inspection of seven 
facilities and the third round of U.S.-North Korea talks is 
expected to take place soon. However, the issue of special 
inspection has not been raised. How do you assess the present 
status of the North Korean nuclear issue? 
  [Han Sung-chu] Ten months have passed since North Korea 
declared its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
[NPT] on 12 March last year. But the nuclear issue has not been 
resolved up to now. I feel regret and sadness over this. 
However, this does not mean that we wasted this ten months. We 
can prevent this problem from going to an extreme situation. 
Moreover, there was no sign that North Korea manufactured 
nuclear materials during this period, or used this period for 
developing and manufacturing nuclear weapons. As you pointed 
out, although we cannot fully assure this, a sign for the 
solution has also appeared. 
  The agreement and comprehension between the United States 
and 
North Korea and discussion on ordinary and ad hoc [imsi] 
inspections between the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA] and North Korea are not the negotiation or agreement for 
the final solution of the North Korean nuclear issue. They are 
of significance in further seeking an essential solution through 
insurance of continuity of nuclear safeguards by IAEA and 
through the third round of North Korea-U.S. talks. Therefore, 
the special inspection, which you mentioned earlier; insurance 
of nuclear safeguards; North Korea's complete nuclear 
transparency pertaining to the denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula; comprehensive checking of North Korea's nuclear 
development; and the like, can be regarded as preparatory 
measures for the next stage, rather than as present-day problems. 
  [Yi Chong-su] What were presented as preconditions for the 
third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks was insurance 
of North Korean nuclear transparency and another was tangible 
progress in North-South dialogue. We understood that only after 
this, the third round of talks can be held and the issue of 
improvement in relations and cooperation can be discussed. 
However, recently, the issue on tangible progress in North-South 
dialogue has not been briskly mentioned even though considerable 
progress appeared in North Korea's nuclear inspection issue. 
Will you tell us about what degree of progress in North-South 
dialogue will enable the United States and North Korea to 
discuss the third round of high-level talks and the issue of 
normalizing relations? 
  [Han] We may say that there is progress in ensuring 
continuity of IAEA's nuclear safeguards measure. There is no 
change in the policy to regard such progress as an indispensable 
step for future dialogue. 
  Likewise, there is no change in the policy of calling for 
tangible progress in North-South dialogue. Therefore, although 
this issue has not been emphasized openly and discussed loudly, 
the third round of U.S.-North Korea talks will not be held 
without tangible progress in North-South dialogue. 
  [Kim] With a sign for the solution of the North Korean 
nuclear issue, do you think that tangible progress in 
North-South relations can be expected in the new year? 
  Some people view that North Korea would reluctantly come to 
dialogue with the ROK merely for the sake of negotiations with 
the United States. What do you, the minister, think of this? 
  [Yi] In the event that the North Korean nuclear issue is 
resolved to a certain degree and progress is seen in North-South 
dialogue, do you think there is a possibility of North-South 
summit talks? 
  [Han] It is too early for us to say that a summit is 
possible or impossible at the moment. However, there is no need 
to exclude the possibility of a summit after the stumbling 
block, also known as the nuclear issue, is removed. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Yi] I would like to ask a question about how the ROK should 
maintain relations with the four neighboring big countries of 
the Korean peninsula. At the end of the Cold War era, can 
ROK-U.S. relations be a little distant or should they become 
even closer? 
  To what degree should relations with Japan be close? Is it 
alright even if relations with Russia are somewhat distant, and 
how close a relationship should we maintain with China? 
  [Han] In maintaining relations with the four big countries 
surrounding the Korean peninsula including the United States, it 
is not desirable to consciously designate precedence and order 
of the countries to keep close or distant relations. 
  However, relations with the United States still remain most 
important in terms of security, economy, and diplomacy. 
ROK-Japan relations are also very good at present in various 
aspects. In fact, the relations are better than ever before. 
Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa visited the ROK last November 
and held a summit with the ROK. The two sides agreed to develop 
relations in a forward-looking manner by overcoming the past to 
the greatest possible extent. I think this is possible. 
  As for relations with China, since relations were normalized 
in August 1992, remarkable progress was effected in the trade 
field, and cooperation in other fields has also been 
satisfactory. In particular, China cooperated with the 
international community for the solution of the nuclear issue 
and made a great contribution to solving this problem through 
dialogue. I believe that China will also contribute to this in 
the future, as well. 
  As for relations with Russia, since diplomatic relations 
were 
established, good relations have been maintained. Although the 
issue of payment in economic cooperation still remain as a 
pending issue, ROK-Russia relations have not been affected 
seriously by this. We hope to maintain good relations with 
Russia. We also hope that Russia will satisfactorily achieve 
political and economic stability at home. Thus, we will maintain 
good relations with the four countries, and amid balanced 
cooperation among these big countries, we will secure our own 
position. 
  [Yi] Will you explain how you are going to implement the 
policy for reunification? 
  [Han] The policy for reunification is closely related to 
pursuing our 5-point basic goals. We may divide it into three 
stages. One is how peacefully and productively we should manage 
the present status of division. For example, the solution of the 
nuclear issue stresses the necessity of diplomacy to manage the 
division. 
  Next, the diplomacy for achieving national reunification and 
for winning the support for this is necessary. In other words, 
we should carry out diplomacy to convince the neighboring 
countries that our reunification is not contradictory but 
corresponds to their interests and to ask for their cooperation. 
This is applicable not only to the aforementioned four countries 
but also to many other countries. We should also seek 
cooperation from international organizations, including the 
United Nations. 
  Last, we should prepare ourselves for the postreunification 
era. We should review how to maintain relations with world 
nations and international organizations after the reunification. 
This is the issue related not only to the Foreign Ministry but 
also to the National Unification Board, other government 
offices, and the people. 
  [Yi] Thank you, Minister Han, for being with us today.

<F P=106> [By Beijing-based correspondent Pak Song-chun] </F>
  [Text] According to a reliable Beijing source, North Korea 
has decided to declare to its people and to the world that it 
would conclude the nuclear issue before March or April and 
announce a PRC-style opening policy. Hwang Chang-yop, chairman 
of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the North Korean Supreme 
People's Assembly, unofficially arrived in Beijing on 15 January 
for an eight-day visit to discuss this, the source said. 
  Hwang, who was appointed chairman of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly--a position which 
actually controls the North Korean nuclear issue and foreign 
affairs--in December 1993 among high-ranking North Korean 
officials, will also discuss President Kim Il-song's visit to 
the PRC with the PRC side, according to the source. 
  It is known that through Kim Il-song's visit to the PRC, 
which is expected to immediately follow Hwang's PRC visit, Kim 
Il-song will make a final discussion with high-ranking PRC 
officials on North Korea's PRC-style opening policy which has 
already been decided by himself. 
  The PRC-style opening policy decided by North Korea will be 
the special economic zone-style adopted by the PRC. North Korea 
has decided to make Najin and Sonbong region the first special 
economic zone and already concluded legislative procedures for 
the opening of the region in relation to the development of the 
lower Tumen river. 
  In relation to the opening-up policy decided by North Korea, 
Hwang, who began his unofficial visit to the PRC from 15 
January, is scheduled to visit Guangzhou and Shenzhen which are 
special economic zones in southern PRC. 
  The Beijing source also said that the ROK Government is 
known 
to be aware of the trend of North Korea's policy and is 
considering to open a liaison office in Najin or Sonbong through 
the UN Development Program after North Korea announces its 
opening up. 
  The source said that in a meeting attended by Kim Il-song, 
North Korean authorities already made such a decision to declare 
a PRC-style opening up policy as a result of an internal 
discussion on the choice of policy direction after the 
resolution of the nuclear issue, and that North Korean 
high-ranking authorities already began drawing up plans to 
implement the opening-up policy for the era after the resolution 
of the nuclear issue.

  [Text] The third working-level contact between the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and North Korea, which 
was expected to take place over this weekend, is postponed until 
next week because there was no reply from Pyongyang authorities. 
  Correspondent Cha Man-sun reports from Vienna. [Begin Cha 
recording] 
  (Feriscos,) director of the inspection bureau of the IAEA, 
revealed that in a telephone contact, (Yun U-chin), counselor at 
the North Korean Embassy in Vienna and the working-level 
delegate of the North Korean side, said that he has not received 
a reply from Pyongyang to the IAEA's telegram, and therefore, 
holding the third working-level contact is difficult this 
weekend. 
  Concerning this, the IAEA inspection-related officials show 
that their position is to wait for the North Korean reply by 
taking a little more time. But they hope that the third working 
contact can be held next week. 
  Meanwhile, it was learned that the list for checking seven 
nuclear facilities which IAEA presented to North Korea on 10 
January was prepared based on the Nuclear Safeguards Accord 
which became effective on 10 April between the IAEA and North 
Korea, and the list calls for compliance with the accord. 
  Article 74 of this accord stipulates that independent 
measurement of nuclear materials, including examination of 
diaries of operation of nuclear facilities, and mobilization of 
all technological inspection measures, are possible, and Article 
75 prescribed that North Korea must cooperate in extracting 
additional (?testing) materials. 
  North Korea accepted overall inspections in 1992 in 
compliance with the Nuclear Safeguards Accord. However, North 
Korea, which is withholding its withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty, shows its position of regarding this 
accord as invalid. Therefore, the reply from North Korea will 
attract public attention in the future. [end recording]

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 15 (YONHAP) -- The opposition Democratic 
Party intends to discuss with the government on possible visit 
to North Korea by party head Yi Ki-taek, buoyed by the reported 
welcome expressed by North Korea to his visit. 
  "Now that North Korea has welcomed Mr. Yi's visit to 
Pyongyang, we will discuss the matter with the government," 
party spokesman Pak Chi-won said on Saturday afternoon. 
  Pak said his party will also consult with many people on 
Yi's 
possible visit to North Korea since he said inter-Korean matters 
require very prudence. [sentence as received] 
  The spokesman further said his party wishes to take the 
occasion to call on both sides of Korea to stop trying to use 
the inter- Korean question for their political gains and to 
strive to promote genuine reconciliation and unification. 
  The North KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY, monitored here, 
reported earlier in the day that Yang Hyong-sop, chairman of the 
Supreme People's Assembly, said in a statement the North would 
welcome it if Yi Ki-taek visits Pyongyang.

<F P=106> [By Yu Yong-ku] </F>
  [Text] In December 1993, North Korea newly formed the 
South, U.S., and Japanese operation teams in the Workers' Party 
of Korea [WPK] and appointed important figures to be chiefs of 
the teams. This has been analyzed as a move to accelerate 
opening up and actively improve relations with these countries 
after the nuclear issue is resolved. 
  According to a Beijing source, North Korea appointed Vice 
Premier Kim Tal-hyon as chief of the South operation team, party 
secretary Kim Yong-sun as chief of the U.S. operation team, and 
Hwang Chang-yop, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of 
the Supreme People's Assembly, to be chief of the Japanese 
operation team. 
  Before the three new operation teams were formed, the 
central 
guidance office of the three revolutions teams, which is totally 
controlled by Kim Chong-il, was the only team that existed in 
North Korea to carry out special missions. Thus, the 
organization of the three new teams shows North Korea's great 
interest in its relations with the ROK, the United States, and 
Japan and is regarded as a step to prepare for improving its 
relations with these countries after the nuclear issue is 
resolved. 
  The organization of the new teams and appointments of their 
chiefs were originally reported by sources in Beijing early this 
year. A government official also recently said: "Special 
operation teams in charge of relations with the South and the 
United States have been formed in the WPK. According to 
information obtained up to the present, Vice President Kim 
Yong-chu and Kim Tal-hyon, who was recently discharged from the 
posts of vice premier and chairman of the State Planning 
Committee, take charge of the South operation team, and WPK 
Secretaries Hwang Chang-yop and Kim Yong-sun take charge of the 
U.S. operation team." The information on Kim Yong-chu's 
appointment as leader of the South operation team, however, 
seems groundless because he is too old to cope with the changing 
situation and because a vice president of a state would not be 
appointed to lead a team with special duties. 
  The information on Kim Tal-hyon's appointment as leader of 
the South operation team is well-grounded. 
  There was a rumor that Kim Tal-hyon was demoted to manager 
of 
the 8 February Vinalon Plant after being dismissed from the 
office of vice premier of the State Administration Council at 
the end of 1993. The fact is, however, that Kim is an authority 
on economic affairs who is close to Kim Chong-il and that the 
document on his dismissal dated 7 December 1993 reads, "..in 
relation to his appointment to another position." 
  If he had lost power, it would have been reported that he 
had been "dismissed," rather than "transferred to another post." 
  After being in charge of external economic affairs, he was 
temporarily appointed chairman of the State Planning Committee 
to deal with the Third Seven-Year Plan, which North Korea had 
been expected to fail to fulfill, established a period of 
adjustment, and carried out the task of coordinating economic 
affairs. As shown, he is still trusted by Kim Il-song and Kim 
Chong-il. 
  Considering the fact that he was once in charge of 
North-South economic cooperation, he may have been transferred 
to a post in charge of North-South economic cooperation, which 
will be pursued when the nuclear issue is resolved, or overall 
North-South relations. 
  Kim Yong-sun was reportedly relieved of his post of 
candidate 
member of the WPK Political Bureau last December, but maintains 
his post of party secretary. It had been speculated that he is 
no longer in charge of South Korean affairs and external 
affairs. However, on 23 November 1993, he attended a Pyongyang 
report meeting on the third anniversary of the founding of the 
National Alliance for the Country's Reunification as an official 
in charge of South Korean affairs, and last December's North 
Korean Supreme People's Assembly [SPA] session confirmed that he 
is still chairman of the SPA Reunification Policy Committee. 
  Considering North Korea's plan to promote its relations with 
South Korea and Japan only after an atmosphere prevails for 
improved ties with the United States, Kim Yong-sun may be 
exclusively in charge of U.S. affairs. 
  Hwang Chang-yop, an official well versed with Japanese 
affairs, who was appointed chairman of the SPA Foreign Affairs 
Committee, is very likely in charge of the Japan team. Japan 
has proposed resuming talks with North Korea to discuss 
normalization of ties between the two countries. At such a 
time, he is now visiting Beijing. This is very significant. 
Still, it is very likely that the U.S., South Korea, and Japan 
teams do not handle completely different jobs, that the jobs of 
Kim Yong-sun, Kim Tal-hyon, and Hwang Chang-yop overlap, and 
that Kim Chong-il personally plays a supervisory role.

  [Excerpts] Phnom Penh, Jan 20 (AFP) - A bitter argument 
between Cambodian Finance Minister Sam Rangsi and a major Thai 
business group went public Thursday as some 1,000 students and 
businessmen demonstrated in support of the minister. 
  Local market vendors, students and other businessmen showed 
up in front of the parliament to denounce the Thai Bunrong 
business consortium for the exhorbitant rents it planned to 
charge for use of a recently completed shopping mall. [passage 
omitted] 
  Another group carried a banner proclaiming, "Students for 
Sam 
Rangsi," while others carried signs echoing the minister's 
recent call for "good investors to come" to Cambodia "and drive 
out the bad." 
  The minister had backed local business groups in their 
protest against the Thai group. 
  A representative of the Khmer Patriotic Youth Association 
said his group was at the gathering because the fight was not 
only for local interests, but also symbolic of defending 
national interests. [passage omitted] 
  Thai Bunrong group chairman Theng Bun-Ma had published an 
open letter in a local paper, which his group owns, accusing Sam 
Rangsi of being a "low grade individual," and addressing him as 
"the Minister of Destroying Economics and Finance." [passage 
omitted] 
  In his letter, Theng Bun-Ma further accused the minister of 
being ungracious, saying he should not criticise officials of 
the previous administration as he owed his presence in Cambodia 
to them. [passage omitted] 
  Separately, elsewhere in the capital, military police tried 
unsuccessfully to evict a group of over 20 soldiers and their 
families who were squatting on state land which has been rented 
out for development. 
  The heavily armed soldiers, loyal to the former military 
wings of the royalist FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an 
Indpendent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] party 
and the small Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party, threatened to 
defend themselves if they were forcibly evicted. 
  "We have fought for many years on the battlefield and we are 
not afraid of dying here," said one soldier, brandishing a M-16 
assault rifle. 
  Police General Kong Saran, however, said the soldiers and 
their families had just arrived on the site Tuesday after having 
travelled from northwest Cambodia. 
  A government official said he suspected there was "a 
political background to the issue," adding that the squatters 
might be part of a deliberate attempt to highlight the problem 
of the sale of state property.

  [Text] Prince Norodom Sirivut, deputy prime minister, has 
said that relations with Malaysia and Indonesia are vitally 
important since Cambodia never has any problems with those 
countries. Meeting with reporters, the prince said that the 
kingdom has received the credentials of ambassadors from 55 
countries. Some are not residing in the country yet and have 
carried out their duties from various other cities, such as 
Bangkok and Beijing. Somehow, the diplomatic ties between our 
Cambodia and those countries have been reinforced and expanded. 
  The prince added: Our country is considering the possibility 
of establishing an embassy in Malaysia, since the good relations 
between the two countries have continued to improve. As for the 
ties with Thailand, they have progressed, but recently we have 
had some problems with the Thais. We still have border 
demarcation problems with Thailand and Vietnam. Among our 
neighbors, Laos is our best friend. For this reason, we have 
permitted the Lao to use the port in Sihanoukville while they 
have allowed us to use their airport in Vientiane. What we have 
done is in the interests of both countries. 
  The prince also said that the creation of a border committee 
proposed by Thailand represents the position of the Royal 
Government of Cambodia [RGC]. The only way to solve the border 
problems is to adopt the Cambodian map of the 1960s, which 
indicates that Cambodia has an area of (191,055) square 
kilometers. International observers should use the map to 
establish the borders and to draw up a report concerning the 
matter for their headquarters in New York. 
  Answering a question about the problem of illegal 
immigrants, 
the prince said the government has never persecuted immigrants, 
especially the Vietnamese. Rebutting a Vietnamese human rights 
group charge that the RGC has committed human rights violations, 
the prince said: Instead we have ensured security for them 
(?for humanitarian reasons). He added that illegal immigrants 
do not consist of only Vietnamese but also Thais, Chinese, and 
other people coming from various regions, and that this issue 
will be completely settled after the National Assembly adopts an 
immigration law in the near future. 
  Commenting on the concerns of foreign investors, the prince 
said the RGC has no intention of revising contracts concluded 
previously. The RGC, however, will review those transactions. 
The prince also said: The issues concerning (?business deals) 
and a floating hotel have already been settled once and for all. 
We only want to legalize their businesses with appropriate 
contracts.

  [Excerpt] During the past few days, many Vietnamese puppet 
forces that the puppet ringleaders sent to attack the people and 
Democratic Kampuchea forces on Route 68 were killed or wounded. 
Almost all of the survivors, who were in total panic, deserted 
the battlefield. 
  Seeing that the first, second, and third groups of his 
assaulting forces were beaten and dispersed, Pol Saroeun, the 
Vietnamese puppets' general staff commander, ordered 500 
soldiers from the Kompong Cham provincial unit to rescue their 
colleagues on Route 68. However, he could mobilize only 300 of 
them. However, nearly 100 of these forces fled while they were 
sent by truck to this area. 
  Between 15 and 18 January, these assaulting forces tried to 
launch an onslaught, but all their attempts were smashed by our 
mine attacks. Many of them were killed or wounded, and their 
trucks and armored personnel carriers were destroyed. All the 
wounded were in despair, waiting only for their dying day. 
  On 16 and 17 January, six trucks hit land mines and were 
shot 
at and destroyed in an area east of Samraong District. 
Fifty-six puppet soldiers were killed, 62 others were wounded, 
and 180 others deserted the battlefield. A major general from 
the engineering unit [name indistinct] and 12 colonels, majors, 
and captains were among those killed. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Report on the crushing of the offensive launched by 
the Vietnamese enemy and its puppets in Kampot Province: 
  1. From 1 January, the enemy mobilized 2,000 troops from 
Kampot, Takeo, Kompong Speu, and Phnom Penh to launch an 
offensive against Democratic Kampuchea's liberated zone in 
Kampot Province. 
  In this offensive, the enemy divided its forces into four 
prongs -- the first came from Route 4 heading toward (Ta Vek); 
the second moved from Vat Chak toward (Ta Kanh); the third moved 
from (?Chhuk) toward Leak and Kaoh Sla; while the fourth came 
along Route 16. 
  2. During the first stage of the battle which lasted from 1 
to 5 January, the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK], 
guerrillas, and people's armed forces in Kampot Province used 
guerrilla and people's warfare tactics against the enemy 
especially all sorts of mines, punji stakes, booby traps, 
cross-bows, [words indistinct] and various types of guns. The 
enemy's offensive forces could neither advance nor retreat. 
  3. From 5 January, the NADK, guerrillas, and people in 
Kampot Province started their assault. They destroyed 12 large 
military trucks, two jeeps, 20 military motocycles, over 10 
walkie-talkies, two 105-mm mortars, and 12 assorted cannons; 
seized 53 assorted pistols, 19 B-40's, seven machineguns, 15 
crates of AK ammunition, 60 crates of B-40 and B-41 ammunition, 
and over 100 cannon shells.

distribute many signed leaflets over the battlefields around 
Tonle Sap lake and the northwest and northern parts of Cambodia 
under the control of Democratic Kampuchea. 
  The aim is to urge patriotic fighters to lay down their

  This is psychological warfare against the Cambodian nation

  The alliance -- the United States, Australia, and France -- 
especially the United States and Australia are the financiers of 
this dirty psychological warfare. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By reporter Ryo Sano] </F>
  [Text] In view of the approaching 11 February Japan-U.S. 
summit meeting, the bilateral framework trade talks have entered 
the final stage. However, concern has been growing over the 
apparent lack of mutual trust between the bureaucrats of the two 
nations who are in charge of the trade talks. The two nations 
have been at odds over setting "objective criteria" to measure 
progress in market access, and hardly any progress has been made 
in the talks. As a result, the United States continues to step 
up its criticism of Japanese bureaucrats. Concern voiced by 
former Japanese bureaucrats has also been noted. 
  "Japanese negotiators like to stay up all night. They do not 
show what is up their sleeves until the eleventh hour. 
Americans are nice, so they show their hands right away." In a 
recent visit to Japan, U.S. Under Secretary of State Joan E. 
Spero, who is in charge of the negotiations, made these remarks 
during a news conference at the Japan National Press Club on 12 
January. She thus complained it was the fault of Japanese 
bureaucrats for causing the two nations to still fail to see 
points where they could agree in the trade talks despite the 
fact that the Japan-U.S. summit meeting is less than a month 
away. 
  In response to such "bashing of Japanese bureaucrats" by 
U.S. 
officials, Keio University professor Makoto Utsumi, in a lecture 
at the Japan National Press Club on 14 January, said: "What is 
making the current trade talks difficult is distrust between 
Japanese and U.S. negotiators." Utsumi, who formerly served as 
deputy vice minister for financial affairs at the Ministry of 
Finance, thus expressed his concern on the outcome of the trade 
talks. 
  Concerning current Japan-U.S. relations, Utsumi considers 
the 
affinitive relationship between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
and U.S. President Bill Clinton as one of the positive factors. 
However, he points out that "U.S. negotiators seem to think 
rather simply that just because Prime Minister Hosokawa enjoys 
high popularity, the Japanese Government should be able to do 
anything, but cannot because the bureaucrats are bad." Utsumi 
explained that the good relations between the leaders seem to 
act in reverse and lead to bureaucrat bashing. 
  Furthermore, Utsumi criticized the United States, saying: 
"Since Prime Minister Hosokawa is a lord, he does not go out to 
directly persuade those concerned. This is the bureaucrats' job 
in Japan. Therefore, it does not do any good for the United 
States to go on bashing Japanese bureaucrats." 
  Explaining that the United States has misunderstandings, 
Utsumi offered the following advice to ensure the trade talks 
proceed smoothly: "First, the two nations should look for 
points where they can agree so they do not have to criticize 
each other. Second, they should take up working on bilateral 
cooperation in practical areas. From there, they should build up 
mutual confidence. This is necessary above all." 
  Tentatively, the focal point of the Japan-U.S. framework 
trade talks is a vice ministerial meeting to be held on 25 
January in Washington. Talks are expected to be held to the 
very limit on individual trade sectors which include automobiles 
and auto parts, insurance services, and government procurement. 
As the United States steps up bureaucrat bashing, Japanese 
Government officials who are actively engaged in the 
negotiations are deliberately trying to remain calm. 
  One Japanese negotiator has said: "In negotiations, there is 
bargaining up to the last moment. Some Japanese and U.S. 
negotiators are personal friends. Therefore, I do not think 
feelings of mutual distrust will grow." Mutual distrust would 
be detrimental to building new bilateral ties. It is hoped that 
calm, constructive discussions will be conducted during the 
trade talks.

  [Text] Japan and the United States are in a deadlock over 
the framework trade talks. Although it has been customary for 
bilateral negotiations to remain entangled up to the eleventh 
hour in the past, virtually no progress has been made this time 
between the two nations ever since they agreed on the basic 
framework of the trade talks last July. Settlement must be made 
in talks on four individual trade sectors -- automobiles and 
auto parts, government procurement of telecommunications 
equipment, government procurement of medical equipment, and 
insurance services -- before the 11 February Japan-U.S. summit 
meeting, but the Japanese and U.S. Governments remain at odds at 
the very outset. The trade talks seem to have entered a tunnel 
with no light visible on the other end yet, due to the 
cumulative effects of such factors as the differences in trade 
policies between the two nations, accumulated mutual distrust, 
and the stagnant Japanese economy. 
<H5>  "Numerical Targets" Have Become Barrier </H5>
  "The United States and Japan see the world differently." 
Jeffrey Garten, under secretary for international economic 
affairs at the U.S. Commerce Department, made this comment to 
describe the extent of the bilateral trade dispute. He visited 
Japan last week to talk with Japanese officials on automobiles 
and auto parts. 
  The "argument over numerical targets" has been the greatest 
barrier to talks over the four individual trade sectors. The 
United States has asserted that "although we do not ask that 
Japan guarantee a certain share of its market to foreign 
products, it is necessary to set up a criteria to determine 
whether progress has been made in market opening." On the other 
hand, Japan has objected that "nothing that will be linked to 
setting numerical targets would be accepted in any form 
whatsoever." 
  The United States has complained that "the Japanese 
Government has distorted U.S. assertions." However, it is 
certain that at the current trade negotiations, the 
administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton, which advocates a 
results-oriented policy as a pillar of U.S. diplomacy toward 
Japan, has stressed the need to reach "an agreement that will 
lead to concrete results." In response to criticism that this 
would lead to "managed trade," the United States argues that 
"what is necessary to open up the Japanese market, which is by 
far the most closed among the major industrialized nations, is 
not managed trade, but rather a policy to crush managed trade." 
<H5>  Arguing Over Past Cases </H5>
  It is widely believed that when the Clinton administration 
hammered out the new framework trade talks last year, it 
designed it taking into consideration the bilateral 
semiconductor agreement and the action program on auto parts. 
The semiconductor agreement encompassed the "hopes" of U.S. 
industrial circles which expected that "foreign semiconductor 
makers should gain a 20-percent share of the Japanese market by 
the end of 1992." The action program which was put together 
during former U.S. President George Bush's visit to Japan in 
early 1992 called for "voluntary target goals" on the part of 
Japanese automakers who vowed "to increase procurement of U.S. 
auto parts to $19 billion in fiscal year 1994." 
  A high-ranking U.S. Government official has said: "Since 
target goals were achieved in accordance with the semiconductor 
agreement, it was possible to avoid a further worsening of trade 
friction between the United States and Japan. This should have 
been to the advantage of Japan, too. We wonder why the Japanese 
are now taking such an inflexible attitude." 
  Concerning the two precedents, however, a Japanese 
negotiator, taking a completely opposite view, has referred to 
them as having taught Japan a lesson, saying: "We yielded under 
U.S. pressure, ending up with a price to pay in the future." 
With the collapse of the cold war structure and the successful 
conclusion of GATT's new round of multilateral trade talks 
(Uruguay Round), Japan has taken the opportunity to try to shift 
its trade policy from a completely U.S.-oriented approach to 
that focusing on GATT. A senior official of the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI] has said agitatedly: 
"The European Union (EU) and Asian nations are paying much 
attention to how Japan handles the trade issues with the United 
States. We must not make inadvertent concessions here." 
  Mutual distrust between Japanese and the U.S. Government 
officials in charge of the trade talks has been another factor 
causing the negotiations to be stalled. Joan E. Spero, U.S. 
under secretary of state for economic, business, and 
agricultural affairs, who visited Japan last week apart from 
Under Secretary of Commerce Garten, complained: "Japanese 
bureaucrats specialize on defense, judo style. They are trying 
to keep dragging on the talks." The United States has begun to 
suspect that Japanese Government ministries and agencies are 
trying to put off negotiations on market access itself by taking 
advantage of the dispute over numerical targets. 
  In response, Japan has irately retorted: "U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor and other U.S. officials have 
started to refer to Japanese automakers' voluntary target goals 
of purchasing $19 billion worth of U.S. auto parts as a 
`Japanese pledge.' There can be no negotiations if they intend 
to push through with such an inconsiderate interpretation." 
<H5>  Narrowing of Competitiveness Has Impact </H5>
  Concerning automobiles and auto parts, the narrowing of 
competitiveness between Japanese and U.S. makers has also cast a 
shadow on the trade talks. 
  So far, the Japan-U.S. automobile friction has been settled 
under a formula where "the strong Japanese industry has given 
due consideration to the ailing U.S. industry." The voluntary 
export restraint regarding passenger vehicles that has been 
continued since 1981 is a classic example. Osamu Watanabe, 
chief of MITI's Machinery and Information Industries Bureau, 
reflects that the action program under which Japan vowed to 
purchase $19 billion worth of auto parts was "a product of 
affluence." 
  Now, however, the Japanese automobile industry cannot afford 
to carry out such plans. Sluggish domestic demand and steady 
yen appreciation have caused automakers' profits to decline 
considerably. Since U.S. automakers have successfully improved 
the quality of their products, the gap in competitiveness 
between Japanese and U.S. automakers is rapidly narrowing. In 
contrast to the Japanese automobile industry, the U.S. 
automobile industry has rapidly reaped profits, supported by a 
recovering domestic economy. The U.S. "Big Three" automakers 
recorded a total profit of $4.7 billion in the period from 
January to September 1993. 
  As a result, there is strong dissatisfaction in some 
quarters 
of MITI, which is in charge of the trade talks, complaining that 
"the U.S. Government has not accurately grasped the current 
situation concerning the automobile industries of both nations." 
  Kiichi Miyazawa, who was then prime minister, unfolded his 
critical argument against managed trade during talks with 
President Clinton last April. With this as a starting point, 
Japan has been determined more than ever to "assert itself" 
since the outset of negotiations on the basic framework of new 
trade talks. The agreement made during the Japan-U.S. summit 
meeting last July was ambiguous, and all it did was to put off 
the problems. In that sense, Japan and the United States have 
been continuously at odds for nine months already.

Edition] 
  [Text] The Japanese Government will present the U.S. 
Government this week with new concessionary proposals, including 
a revamp of the current tender system, for the government 
procurement sector which is the subject of discussion at 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. 
  The government, which had insisted that more than 130,000 
SDR 
(special drawing rights; approximately 20.15 million yen) worth 
of government procurement be subject to bids, has decided to 
lower that figure to 100,000 SDR (approximately 15.5 million 
yen). The government also has decided to extend the 
announcement period of bids on the OFFICIAL GAZETTE by 10-20 
days. 
  Another decision is the adoption of a new system under which 
the government briefs foreign and domestic firms on its outline 
procurement plans prior to publishing them in the OFFICIAL 
GAZETTE. In this way, the government has decided to accept most 
U.S. demands in a bid to break the stalemate in the Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks. 
  One of the priority sectors at the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks is procurement of medical instruments and 
telecommunications equipment. The government intends to ask for 
U.S. concessions by presenting its own concessionary proposals 
at a working-level meeting on medical instruments scheduled in 
Tokyo on 18 and 19 January, and at a working-level meeting on 
telecommunications equipment due to be held in Washington on 22 
January. 
  According to the concessionary proposals, more than 100,000 
SDR worth of medical instruments and telecommunications 
equipment would be subject to bid. The Japanese Government has 
so far insisted on running announcements for medical instruments 
and telecommunications equipment for 40 days in the OFFICIAL 
GAZETTE, but has decided to extend this to 50 days. 
  However, it has decided to keep the current 40-day period 
unchanged for such widely used medical items as X-ray machines, 
though extend the period to 60 days for specialist medical 
instruments which require longer to develop.

  [Text] Senior officials of the Ministry of Finance [MOF] 
voice dissatisfaction with the U.S. position in the insurance 
sector negotiations of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, 
claiming "we cannot compromise in a one-sided, unreasonable, and 
unfair negotiation." Japanese life and nonlife insurers also 
agree with them. According to sources in the MOF and the 
insurance industry, U.S. demands are all "unreasonable," and it 
is rather the U.S. insurance market which is "closed." 
Furthermore, the United States has been strongly critical of 
the Japanese Government, the Japanese bureaucracy in particular, 
even outside the framework talks. This has aggravated the 
antipathy on the Japanese side. 
  Meetings on the insurance sector had been held on 10 and 11 
January in Washington since the beginning of 1994. Yet, the gap 
between the positions of the two countries have not narrowed. 
Japan looks at the U.S. position as a completely uncritical 
representation of the demands of some private companies, and 
sees these demands as incoherent. Moreover, officials of the 
Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) are in charge of 
the negotiations, and they are not knowledgeable about the 
insurance sector, and "cannot conduct discussions based on the 
actual market situation," (according to a senior MOF official). 
  Specific U.S. demands on the Japanese market include: 1) 
clarification of the standards for approving new products; 2) 
the introduction of a "broker" system, which is independent from 
the insurance companies and recommends insurance companies for 
the benefit of the clients; 3) reform of the insurance premium 
computation association system; 4) expansion of foreign 
companies' share in government-related insurance business; 5) 
postponement of liberalization of the third sector, where both 
life and nonlife insurance companies participate in the market; 
6) rectifying the practice of insurance contracts between 
"keiretsu" companies; and 7) adopting market share of foreign 
companies as an objective criterion to gauge the openness of the 
market. 
  Among these demands, for instance, the brokerage system has 
not even been introduced in 12 states in the United States. 
Furthermore, in the State of New York and several other states, 
foreign insurance companies are required to put up property in 
trust as the equivalent of reserve fund for liabilities; there 
is actual discrimination against non-U.S. companies. The MOF 
explains that "The Japanese insurance market is not closed 
compared to the U.S. market, but the USTR does not know this." 
  With regard to the demand that liberalization in the third 
sector be postponed for five years, Japan believes that "On the 
whole, the United States demands the relaxation of regulations. 
Yet, it wants postponement only in an area where foreign 
companies are strong. That is self-serving." 
  Japan also strongly refutes the U.S. claim that foreign 
insurance companies' share in the Japanese market is small, and 
thus, the Japanese market is closed, asserting "the figures 
cited are inaccurate." While the USTR claims that foreign share 
in the U.S. market is 10 percent, a senior MOF official says 
that Equitable Insurance, where Japanese and French insurance 
companies hold a majority of the stock, is counted as a foreign 
company, but foreign capital has no control in that company, and 
"no American would consider Equitable a foreign company." 
  According to OECD statistics, foreign insurance companies' 
share in the nonlife sector was 2.7 percent in Japan, and 0.9 
percent in the United States in 1990. The MOF interprets this 
to mean "you can say the U.S. market is more exclusionary." The 
Japanese insurance industry also decries the fact that the share 
of Japanese nonlife insurance companies is merely 0.1 percent in 
the U.S. market, while "national treatment for foreign nonlife 
insurance companies is being applied in Japan. It is rather the 
U.S. insurance market which is closed" (according to Sotaro 
Aoki, managing director of Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance 
Company). 
  While Japan's current accounts surplus is the main reason 
for 
conducting the framework talks, in the case of the insurance 
sector, the balance of payments between Japan and the United 
States in fiscal 1990 showed a deficit of $420 million on the 
part of Japan. The MOF and the insurance industry remain 
doubtful if "insurance ought to have been an area of 
negotiation." 
  Even though Japan sees the U.S. market to be more 
exclusionary, the United States regards the framework talks as a 
venue to correct the closedness of the Japanese market, and 
refuses to do anything to rectify the U.S. market. In other 
words, it takes the position of "rejecting two-way discussions." 
It even demands prior consultation with the MOF on the 
insurance system reform the ministry is undertaking at present. 
MOF negotiators call this "saying whatever pleases them." 
  There is very little time left before the deadline of the 
negotiations on 11 February, when a summit meeting will be held 
between the leaders of both countries. Many in the MOF are of 
the opinion that "we would like to deviate from the old pattern 
of compromising in the end." Some even express the view that "a 
compromise will rather undermine bilateral relations in the 
future." Negotiations in the insurance sector are bound to 
continue with the possibility of a breakdown constantly haunting 
the negotiators.

  [Text] A top official of the Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry said on 18 January that Japan-U.S. accord on 
the economic framework talks may be postponed if the United 
States sticks to its demand for setting numerical targets. 
  The official said: "If the United States adheres to the 
numerical targets, the two nations are unlikely to reach an 
accord on the objective criteria during the Hosokawa-Clinton 
talks in February. In that case, the settlement of the issue 
should be postponed until the next [G-7] summit in summer."

  [Text] As of 18 January, the Communications Industry 
Association of Japan [CIAJ] (with Tadashi Sekizawa, president of 
Fujitsu Ltd., as chairman) submitted to the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications written statements concerning the Japan-U.S. 
framework trade talks. In the statements, the CIAJ -- which is 
made up of communications equipment manufacturers and other 
related businesses -- requested the Japanese Government reject 
U.S. demands for setting numerical targets. The industry trade 
group also strongly requested that Nippon Telegraph and 
Telephone (NTT) Corporation be exempt from trade agreements. 
  The statements were submitted together with supplementary 
data which included actual import-export figures between Japan 
and the United States for telecommunications equipment as well 
as the current situation regarding procurement of communications 
equipment by the governments of both nations. Among requests 
listed in the statements were: 1) that Japan and the United 
States conduct trade talks on a two-way basis; 2) that objective 
criteria which could become numerical targets should be 
eliminated in the talks; 3) that trade agreements should be made 
in the spirit of the GATT accords on government procurement; and 
4) that NTT be exempt from trade agreements.

  [Text] Okinawa's problems concerning the presence of U.S. 
military bases are expected shortly to be discussed by the U.S. 
House Committee on the Armed Services. Director Choko Takayama 
of the Okinawa Governor's executive office said on 17 January 
the information came from U.S. Representative Neil Abercrombie, 
55, a Democrat from Hawaii. At the house committee, 
Representative Abercrombie is expected to question U.S. military 
and government officials on "why U.S. Forces maintain such huge 
military bases on Okinawa rather than returning the land to the 
local people." 
  As part of a follow-up to Governor Masahide Ota's Washington 
visit seeking a breakthrough on the U.S. bases issue, the 
prefectural government last year invited Representative 
Abercrombie and other U.S. officials to visit Okinawa. 
Representative Abercrombie is known for his work in campaigning 
for cutbacks to military bases in Hawaii. After observing bases 
on Okinawa, Representative Abercrombie stressed the need to 
review U.S. policy on military bases on Okinawa, saying: "We 
should now review the significance of the military bases, 
because the significance was determined 50 years ago. My duty 
is to provide appropriate advice based on necessary information. 
I promise I will fulfill the duty." 
  Mr. Gene La Rocque, a retired naval officer who is known in 
Japan because he confirmed the possession by U.S. Navy vessels 
in Japanese territorial waters of nuclear weapons, also visited 
Okinawa at the invitation of the prefectural government. He has 
produced television programs on U.S. base problems on Okinawa. 
Representative Abercrombie has obtained three video recordings 
of Mr. La Rocque's programs to show to other house Armed 
Services Committee members. 
  A 30-minute program produced by Mr. La Rocque was broadcast 
in the United States through the PBS Network, a nationwide 
television network which has access to about 100 stations. 
Viewers in Washington watched the program at the end of last 
year, New Yorkers saw it on New Year's Day. A videotape of the 
program has been sent to the prefectural government, and it 
reportedly focuses on the financial burden of maintaining 
military bases on Okinawa, saying: "Redevelopment of returned 
U.S. bases would benefit the local community (Okinawa), and U.S. 
taxpayers could save a lot of money."

<F P=106> [By correspondent Yoshihisa Komori] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 30 Nov -- A U.S. Government 
organization recently finished translating Blueprint for 
Building a New Japan [Nihon Kaizo Keikaku] 
written by Ichiro Ozawa. The translated version will soon be 
distributed to government offices in charge of diplomacy toward 
Japan. It is quite exceptional for the U.S. Government to 
translate the full text of a book published in Japan, and in 
such a short time. In recent years The Japan That Can Say 
`No', which was co-authored by Akio Morita and Shintaro 
Ishihara, has been the only Japanese book translated by 
Washington. It is said the United States is interested in 
Ozawa's book because it considers him a behind-the-scenes strong 
man in the present Japanese coalition government, and thus is 
closely observing him. However, the actual opinion of Ozawa by 
U.S. Government officials seems to be a mixture of praise and 
apprehension, or trust and suspicion. 
  The Clinton administration is paying close attention to 
Ozawa. His book "Blueprint for Building a New Japan 
was published in May. Since then, it has been on the 
best-sellers list. The translation was undertaken by the 
Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS), an organization 
related to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). FBIS's main 
tasks include monitoring radio broadcasts of foreign countries, 
picking up news reports and comments concerning the United 
States, and translating them. Because of its superior 
capability in foreign languages, FBIS is sometimes asked to do 
emergency translations, as in the case with Ozawa's book. 
  The translation of the book into English is reportedly 
finished. In December, the translated version will be published 
as a monograph and distributed as an FBIS publication intended 
for U.S. Government use by officials of those departments and 
offices dealing with Japan, as well as to concerned members of 
Congress. 
  A copy of the English version obtained by SANKEI SHIMBUN 
recently shows that the entire 258 pages of the original, from 
the "Foreword" to the very last word of the text, were 
translated in full in 118 pages of English text. The English 
translation is marked "For Official Use Only," indicating this 
is only to be used as internal reference material by the U.S. 
Government, apparently a move to avoid any copyright violations. 
  The Japan That Can Say No was also translated in 
full in 1989. In the book Ishihara discussed "the export of 
high-technology products which can be converted to military use 
in the USSR." This drew the Department of Defense's attention, 
which commissioned a private specialist organization to do the 
English translation. 
  However, this time a CIA-affiliated organization is directly 
involved in the translation. On 29 November a U.S. Government 
source explained the reason for this unusual procedure. He 
stated: "This shows that the U.S. Government believes that 
knowing the role played by Ozawa, and being acquainted with his 
thinking, is most important to projecting on Japanese politics, 
which presently are in a crucial phase of transition." 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has published three books 
in 
Japanese. So far the United States has not reacted in a similar 
manner. 
  Another U.S. Government source who has been involved in the 
Japan policy of a number of U.S. administrations said: "From 
the time Ozawa was deputy secretary general of the Liberal 
Democratic Party, his personal ability and positive attitude 
toward relations with the United States, plus his connections 
with Kanemaru and Takeshita, led to a tendency on the part of 
the United States to count on him for alleviating Japan-U.S. 
friction. Such expectations remain unchanged." 
  It is true that people inside the U.S. Government have a 
highly favorable opinion of Ozawa for successfully concluding 
the very difficult negotiations with then U.S. Trade 
Representative Carla Hills during the 1989 Japan-U.S. 
telecommunication talks. Those who actually participated in the 
negotiations say that "his thinking and logic is sharp, and he 
has great implementation ability." They add that "he holds a 
vision which designates maintaining strong relations with the 
United States as the cornerstone of Japanese foreign policy." 
  U.S. public opinion of Ozawa remains favorable. However, 
some people express concern that Ozawa "plans to introduce an 
independent line for Japan's long-term security; he will 
eventually oppose the U.S. line." They feel that "one needs to 
be careful about his role as a power broker, his involvement in 
money politics, and his nationalistic aspect." This is also 
regarded by some as one reason for undertaking a full 
translation of his book.

Edition] 
  [Text] The government released the text of notes exchanged 
between the Japanese and U.S. Governments on the bilateral 
construction talks. It says that to monitor the extent of 
foreign companies' participation in the Japanese construction 
market, 10 items in six areas will be adopted as criteria. The 
government believes that this criteria "will not develop into 
numerical targets" (according to Shigeo Mochizuki, 
administrative vice minister of construction). 
  These notes were exchanged on 19 January between Takakazu 
Kuriyama, ambassador to the United States, and Ronald Brown, 
U.S. commerce secretary. Other criteria cited includes the 
construction project clients' assessment of efforts by foreign 
companies to win bids, and the number of registered foreign 
companies. Regular bilateral consultations will be held once a 
year beginning April 1995, when the government's "action 
program" for reform of the bidding system will be fully 
implemented, to make comprehensive assessments until the end of 
1999. 
  With regard to the criteria, the Construction Ministry 
maintains that: "These are for the purpose of assessing progress 
made so far objectively; the United States had not even demanded 
setting numerical targets." The government takes a similar 
position in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks; it rejects 
setting numerical targets. It asserts that "negotiations should 
not be on a bilateral basis, but should be done at GATT" 
(according to a Foreign Ministry source). 
  However, the U.S. construction industry and Congress are 
still calling for setting a market share target. Depending on 
the number of contracts U.S. companies can win from now on, 
frictions may rekindle in the areas of design and consultancy, 
where U.S. companies have a strong desire to make inroads into 
the market.

  [Text] Regarding the alleged Coordinating Committee on 
Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom) violation by Yokohama Kikai 
Boeki [Yokohama Machinery Trading Co.] and other companies who 
have reportedly exported spectrum analyzers to North Korea, the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] is 
increasingly concerned about the case, saying, "largely due to 
the fact that the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks are facing 
rough going, this case may increase criticism of Japan by the 
United States" (according to a senior official). 
  Following the end of the East-West cold war, banning of arms 
exports to the Communist bloc is losing its meaning, and Cocom 
is scheduled to be abolished in March. However, the Cocom 
member nations are considering creating a new export control 
system to control export to "strife-potential" countries and 
regions. For that reason, MITI thinks "this illegal export case 
has occurred at a bad time." 
  Together with Iraq and Libya, North Korea is included on the 
list of countries to which exports are controlled. Furthermore, 
the U.S. Government has been criticized by the Congress and 
other observers for being weak-kneed in its ongoing negotiations 
with North Korea about nuclear facilities inspection. In 
addition, within the United States there is growing 
dissatisfaction with Japan about Japan's position on whether 
objective criteria should be established in the framework of the 
Japan-U.S. economic talks, which are entering the final stage. 
  Since the case has occurred amid such a situation, MITI is 
concerned it will invite criticism of Japan such as in the 
Toshiba case in 1987, wherein Toshiba Machine Co. Ltd. violated 
Cocom, resulting in Japan-bashing by the United States. At that 
time, for example, a member of the Congress smashed Toshiba-made 
products, reflecting growing criticism of Japan. Because of 
that bitter experience, MITI is now wary of the situation and 
says: "There is the possibility that the Congress or other 
sources will apply more pressure at the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks." 
  MITI is scheduled to examine the case involving the trading 
house with emphasis on "whether the manufacturer was involved in 
the case." According to a senior MITI official, "The U.S. 
Government itself probably does not want to make a fuss about 
the case because its talks with North Korea are facing an 
important turning point." However, it seems that what MITI 
really hopes is that the case will end up "as just a case of a 
trading firm acting illegally."

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 20 Jan 94 Morning </F>
Edition] 
  [Text] The coalition government plans to map out an 
additional package of stimulus measures next week. Commenting 
on the question of whether the stimulus package includes the 
income tax reduction, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii told a 
news conference on the evening of 19 January: "The Economic 
Consultative Council (chaired by Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime 
minister and foreign minister) of the ruling parties will be 
asked to discuss the question. In my view, it is desirable that 
the additional package of stimulus measures include the income 
tax reduction." As for the question of how to make up for a 
fiscal shortfall incurring from cuts in the income tax, Mr. 
Fujii said: "I think the council also will be asked to discuss 
the question." Asked to comment on reports that Japan-U.S. 
finance ministerial talks would be held on 23 January, the 
finance minister said: "Although there has been no formal 
request for the talks from the United States, I will have to 
positively consider holding the talks if the United States makes 
such a request." 
  Asked about the future of political reform at the news 
conference, the finance minister declined to specifically 
mention a schedule for carrying out the political reform, 
saying: "I am not in a position to predict how the political 
reform will be carried out in the future." Referring again to 
the additional package of stimulus measures, Mr. Fujii said: 
"Now, government ministries, especially the Economic Planning 
Agency, are working on the package and substantial progress has 
been made. I think that they will map out the package before 
long." At the news conference, he repeated his view that the 
Economic Consultative Council will discuss ways in detail for 
the income tax reduction. 
  On the Japan-U.S. finance ministerial talks, Mr. Fujii said 
the United States had not formally sounded out Japan about 
holding the talks, but added: "I understand that Treasury 
Secretary Bentsen will stop in a Tokyo suburb for his plane's 
refueling on 23 January on his way back to Washington from his 
visit to China."

Edition] 
  [Text] Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] held a ceremony to 
mark the formation of its Nagaoka Chapter in Nagaoka City, 
Niigate Prefecture, on 16 January. Speaking at the ceremony, 
Hiroshi Kumagai, Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] minister, touched on the "Basic Plan for Public 
Investment" that has been taken up for discussion at the 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks and said: "Japan has 
promised the world that it will spend 430 trillion yen for 
public works projects by the year 2000, and the Japanese 
Government has moved up their implementation. The government is 
now studying the possibility of spending an additional 100 
trillion yen for the public works projects." In this way, Mr. 
Kumagai made it clear that the government plans to drastically 
increase the budget for public works projects. Referring to the 
Japan's economic growth rate, Mr. Kumagai said: "About 3 percent 
is compatible with the potentiality of the Japanese economy. 
The government is studying the possibility of adopting a policy 
to attain a 3-percent growth rate next year."

  [Text] Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura denied 
on 13 January the possibility of a cabinet reshuffle in the near 
future, and stressed that "what happens to my job as chief 
cabinet secretary depends 100 percent on what Prime Minister 
Hosokawa thinks." 
  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito have been 
strongly critical of Takemura for maintaining covert contacts 
with the Liberal Democratic Party -- from which he bolted in 
1993 -- in connection with political reform and an anticipated 
realignment of political parties. The two parties are reported 
to have privately asked the prime minister to replace the chief 
cabinet secretary. 
  However, Takemura, who enjoys the prime minister's full 
backing, intends to resist such moves. Conflict within the 
ruling coalition parties are expected to intensify as a result. 
  Allegedly, there have been recurring demands for Takemura's 
replacement since late 1993. However, the prime minister 
believes that the replacement of someone who has been a major 
ally since well before the start of his administration, would 
certainly unsettle the political base of the coalition, which is 
built on a delicate balance between the Shinseito-Komeito bloc 
led by Ichiro Ozawa, the Shinseito secretary general, and 
Takemura supporters. He has, therefore, taken a cautious 
approach. 
  However, Takemura himself has been afflicted by a growing 
sense of crisis. On the evening of 12 January, he held a 
meeting with officials of his Sakigake [Harbinger] Party while 
maintaining telephone contact with the prime minister. He also 
confirmed that "there would be no cabinet reshuffle yet" with 
the prime minister's office on the morning of 13 January, and 
announced this at a news conference shortly afterward. 
  Takemura said at the news conference, "I think I am the 
target of all sorts of criticism." The comment showed his 
concern at the strong criticism of him from the ruling coalition 
parties. 
  However, he also said: "I will continue to work hard and 
exert my utmost efforts to do my job." The remark showed he did 
not seem daunted by calls for him to be replaced. 
  The issue of a cabinet reshuffle is expected to reemerge 
after the end of the next regular session of the Diet. 
Takemura, by subtly emphasizing that the power of appointment 
lies with the prime minister, seemed to indicate that for the 
time being, he would focus on maintaining his alliance with the 
prime minister and continue his confrontation with the Ozawa 
group.

  [Text] With the prospect opening for the passage of four 
political reform bills during the current Diet session, the 
rivalry between Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, and 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito is resurfacing. On 
13 January, it was abruptly reported that the cabinet would be 
reshuffled shortly after the Diet's passage of the political 
reform bills. In reaction, Prime Minister Hosokawa and 
officials in the Prime Minister's Official Residence were eager 
to discredit the reports, saying: "The cabinet reshuffle is not 
under consideration at all." It is true, however, that 
Shinseito and Komeito are weighing when to reshuffle the cabinet 
with the primary aim of "ousting Mr. Takemura as chief cabinet 
secretary" after the Diet's passage of the political reform 
bills. Like the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] era, some 
members of the ruling parties are patients stricken with 
"minister disease" and the reports on the cabinet reshuffle are 
likely to smolder without interruption in Nagata-cho. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura was quick to react to the 
reports of the "cabinet reshuffle." He confirmed the prime 
minister's "real intentions" about the reported cabinet 
reshuffle before holding a regular morning news conference. 
Speaking at the news conference, Mr. Takemura said: "I was 
greatly surprised by the reports." He went on to say: "The 
prime minister told me that he does not consider reshuffling his 
cabinet at all at a time when the political reform bills are at 
a crucial stage and his government is saddled with such major 
policy tasks as stimulus measures and the compilation of the 
1994 fiscal budget." In this way, he suggested that he got a 
promise from the prime minister that the latter will keep him in 
his chief cabinet secretary post. 
  Asked if some ruling parties are asking for a cabinet 
reshuffle with an eye on the replacement of the chief cabinet 
secretary, Mr. Takemura categorically denied the request, 
saying, "I do not know of such a request." Mr. Takemura also 
stressed: "I have been doing my best to shore up the coalition 
government." Asked about the future treatment of Sadao 
Yamahana, minister in charge of political reform, after the 
passage of the political reform bills, whose treatment is said 
to have a momentum for the cabinet reshuffle, Mr. Takemura said: 
"I conferred with the prime minister about that matter" and went 
on to say: "Even if the Diet passes the political reform bills, 
there are still major issues such as the demarcation of 
(single-seat constituency), the reform of the House of 
Councilors, and the reform of local governments. The political 
reform is not finished yet." In this way, Mr. Takemura 
suggested that Mr. Yamahana will not be replaced after the 
passage of the political reform bills. 
  As parliamentarians close to Mr. Takemura said with 
displeasure: "We are aware of the origin of information that has 
fueled the reports," Shinseito and Komeito are increasingly 
hostile toward Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura. Some members 
of the two parties are voicing their intentions to seek the 
replacement of the chief cabinet secretary at an opportune time. 
  A senior member of Shinseito "condemns" Mr. Takemura, 
saying: 
"Mr. Takemura has given his priority to consultations with the 
LDP and he is unfit to serve as a troubleshooter in the ruling 
parties." Shinseito and Komeito appear to be intending to keep 
Mr. Takemura out of the center of power in an attempt to take 
the leadership in realigning the political parties after the 
passage of the political reform bills. In an interview carried 
in a magazine, to go on sale this week, Mr. Takemura made it 
clear that he takes a different political stance with Shinseito 
Representative Secretary Ozawa. In this way, Mr. Takemura is 
increasingly taking an anti-Ozawa attitude. 
  Aides to the prime minister say: "Some members of the ruling 
parties feel that the present cabinet members look good. But we 
do not know what will happen to them after an ordinary Diet 
session...." (according to a high-ranking government official). 
They also say: "We do not know what will happen to the present 
cabinet members after the Diet's enactment of the 1994 fiscal 
budget," (according to a senior Shinseito member). In this way, 
some members of the ruling parties have begun voicing the need 
for the cabinet reshuffle before or after an ordinary Diet 
session due to be convened in late January with a duration of 
150 days. 
  Therefore, there is a possibility that the passage of the 
political reform bills in the Diet will rekindle the rivalry 
between Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura, and Shinseito and 
Komeito, and spark a full-fledged tug of war between each ruling 
party over the cabinet reshuffle.

  [Text] A report that talk of a cabinet reshuffle is rife 
within the government and ruling parties has created a stir. On 
13 January, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa denied the report, 
telling reporters he is "not considering" a cabinet reshuffle. 
  Meanwhile, an influential member of the ruling parties said 
an early cabinet reshuffle would be a good thing. 
  He said: "It is a fact that a cabinet reshuffle is being 
discussed. This is a good time to establish a full-fledged 
administration." 
  As far as the prime minister is concerned, it seems he has 
no 
choice but to be cautious in his approach to the matter because 
he has no wish to cause a crack in the administration's 
foundation. He needs to tread carefully because the reason the 
talk of a cabinet reshuffle is the confrontation between 
Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. 
  It is expected, however, that talk of a cabinet reshuffle 
may 
hang around for the time being. 
  When asked, the prime minister avoided answering questions 
about the timing of a cabinet reshuffle. 
  He said: "That is far ahead. There are many mountains and 
rivers that we have to cross before then." 
  However, a senior member of the ruling parties, who is 
reportedly close to Mr. Ozawa, admitted that "the idea of 
reshuffling the cabinet has been discussed since the end of the 
last year." 
  He said there were two reasons why the administration had 
considered the issue: 1) To get positive cooperation from the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan by inviting its chairman 
Tomiichi Murayama to join the cabinet after getting State 
Minister for Political Reform Sadao Yamahana to leave office; 
and 2) to replace Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura. 
  It appears Prime Minister Hosokawa would find it difficult 
to 
sack Mr. Takemura because he has been a long-time friend since 
well before the administration took power. Mr. Hosokawa 
reportedly told the senior coalition official that he "could not 
dismiss Mr. Takemura alone." 
  Although the prime minister has denied the possibility of an 
early cabinet reshuffle, the senior official said: "It is 
reported that the prime minister secretly met Mr. Ozawa and 
Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa at the end of last 
year, and indicated he intended to carry out a cabinet 
reshuffle." 
  As a result of the talk, Mr. Takemura told a press 
conference 
on 13 January: "Although I think there has been some criticism 
of me, I have put all my trust on the issue of whether or not I 
leave office to the prime minister. I would like to devote 
myself single- mindedly to my job, though bracing myself for 
what may follow." 
  Mr. Takemura denied the possibility that Mr. Yamahana would 
resign as political reform minister after the passage of the 
political reform bills. 
  He said: "Even after the bills are passed by the Diet, there 
is a task of drawing electoral districts." 
  It is believed that Mr. Takemura's remarks indicated his 
displeasure, seeing any cabinet reshuffle as the work of Mr. 
Ozawa and others. Facing confrontation within the 
administration, the prime minister will likely be forced to make 
a difficult decision.

<F P=106> [Article by Tomoo Yamaguchi, political commentator] </F>
  [Text] Unclear Where Coalition Government Is 
Headed 
  Prime Minister [Morihiro] Hosokawa admits he is "fuzzy" [on 
details], but he seems to be off to a popular start, generally 
earning voter support ratings of 70 percent or so in every major 
mass media poll. 
  Though debates during the special Diet session failed to 
flesh out the real image of the Hosokawa coalition government, 
during press conferences, Hosokawa, his eyes on approval 
ratings, shows himself to be a very competent and skilled 
performer. 
  Introducing a White House style to his very first press 
conference soon after taking office, Hosokawa startled those 
present while also creating a fresh, new impression by pointing 
his pen at reporters, indicating whose questions he would take 
next. 
  When he was ready to announce his economic emergency 
measures, though short on particulars, he sat himself down 
before a panel of questioners, explaining and assessing the 
measures himself, clearly viewing the occasion not so much as a 
press conference as a way into the nation's living rooms via the 
television. 
  The substance of these economic measures--a package of 
deregulatory measures and proposed government spending amounting 
to about 6.2 trillion yen to stimulate the economy and help 
businesses recoup profits lost by the high yen exchange 
rate--were not enough to satisfy domestic industries or United 
States demands, but coming just before the new administration's 
inauguration, perhaps they were about as much as could be 
expected. 
  The new government is a coalition of eight parties. It is 
probably like the saying, "to expect a lot, in the end, is to 
cry for the moon." 
  But even granting the unusualness of an eight-party 
coalition, voters are not going to give the new administration 
an indefinite period of grace. The most important job for the 
new administration at this point, as far as the voters are 
concerned, is stimulating the economy. Closely related to this, 
too, are the economic talks between the United States and Japan. 
Even if political reform is put through, there is no guarantee 
that voters will be seeing a turn for the better in their 
standard of living. 
  Nor, supposing that we have an electoral system combining 
single-seat constituencies with proportional representation, can 
we assume that necessarily means an improvement in government or 
better politicians. 
  When all is said and done, we still haven't a clear idea of 
where the Hosokawa coalition government is headed. Even Prime 
Minister Hosokawa's leadership ability is an unknown quantity. 
  Moreover, even without these questions, the new government 
is 
said to have a "dual power structure." The person drawing a 
great deal of attention is Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] 
secretary general Ichiro Ozawa, one of the key figures in the 
formation of the coalition. 
  Takemura the Best Choice as Chief Cabinet Secretary 
  It is not an exaggeration to say Shinseito has a monopoly on 
the new administration's key posts with Tsutomu Hata as deputy 
prime minister and foreign minister, Hirohisa Fujii as finance 
minister, Hiroshi Kumagai as head of the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI], Eijiro Hata as 
agriculture, forestry, and fisheries minister, and Keisuke 
Nakanishi as general director of the Defense Agency. 
  Ozawa, for his part, heads the ruling coalition's highest 
coordinating body, the Representatives Forum [daihyosha 
kaigi], which is made up of the secretary generals and 
general secretaries [and their equivalents from the coalition 
parties]. With Komeito secretary general Yuichi Ichikawa and 
Democratic Socialist Party general secretary Takeshi Yonezawa 
teamed together to form a scrummage, the Social Democratic Party 
of Japan [SDPJ], no matter how hard it tries, finds itself 
outnumbered. Young SDPJ general-secretary Hirotaka Akamatsu has 
had more than he can handle. 
  Clearly, a dual power structure exists. But, ironically, 
because of the new coalition's fragility, this dual structure 
has not come prominently to the fore. Keeping in mind that no 
one stands to gain if the coalition breaks apart, the parties 
are exercising restraint to avoid that danger. 
  Still speaking in general terms, the coalition came safely 
out of the special Diet session. However, specifics will be 
argued when parties meet for the extraordinary session of the 
Diet. Naturally, frictions and contradictions in the dual power 
structure will be unavoidable. 
  Hosokawa has surrounded the Official Residence with members 
of the Sakigake [Harbinger]. For its part, the Shinseito wanted 
Kumagai to fill the post of chief cabinet secretary and 
Toshihiro Nikai, the post of deputy cabinet secretary. 
  The chief cabinet secretary's function is that of cabinet 
coordinator and spokesperson, a role that comes from his serving 
as the prime minister's right-hand man and in a capacity similar 
to head clerk, or banto, for members of the cabinet. 
Traditionally, as probably only natural, prime ministers have 
chosen only those whom they could place their greatest trust in 
for the post. Since all information to and from the Official 
Residence goes through his hands, his political importance is 
without comparison to other members of the cabinet. 
  If Kumagai had become chief cabinet secretary, because he 
belongs to Ozawa's innermost circle of associates, Prime 
Minister Hosokawa might have been labeled an Ozawa puppet. 
  The best choice, and the one Hosokawa finally settled on, 
was 
Sakigake president Masayoshi Takemura. Close friends since their 
days as governor, Takemura and Hosokawa helped each other out 
during the recent lower house election, and the Sakigake is soon 
to merge with Hosokawa's Japan New Party. 
  Rengo [Japanese Trade Union Confederation] chairman Akira 
Yamagishi, said to have been one of the leading actors in the 
formation of the new coalition government, met separately with 
Hosokawa and Takemura prior to the Cabinet's inauguration. 
  Relating his impressions of both politicians, he says: "It's 
hard to tell whether Hosokawa has any content. I guess you could 
say he's `fuzzy.' Takemura, on the other hand, has a philosophy, 
and because he expresses himself frankly, he's persuasive." 
  In fact, Takemura seems to have made the better impression 
of 
the two. 
  During their meeting, Takemura sought Yamagishi's 
understanding of his position. "I've worked with the labor 
unions (as governor)," he said, "so I understand the situation 
of Rengo (and the labor unions). But aside from me, members of 
Sakigake haven't had any experience with labor unions other than 
in what you might call an adversarial relationship. Eventually, 
I can get them to understand, but it'll take a while, so I need 
time." 
  Yamagishi said he understood. It was probably this kind of 
exchange that left him with his favorable impression of Takamura. 
  Shift in the Official Residence Toward Sakigake 
  Hosokawa eventually chose Yukio Hatoyama to serve as his 
deputy cabinet secretary. The decision was so sudden it even 
took Hatoyama by surprise. Having ceded the chief cabinet 
secretary's post to Takemura, Shinseito put up a fight, 
unwilling to relinquish the deputy cabinet secretary post. 
Acting as a coordinator and informational liaison to the ruling 
coalition party, the deputy cabinet secretary can be likened to 
an "official residence affairs committee chairman." Without a 
doubt, it was a post Ozawa wanted for Shinseito. Before a 
decision was made, the party leaked a story to the press, saying 
Toshihiro Nikai's appointment had been firmed up. This 
"appointment by the press" is probably a good indication of just 
how determined the party was. 
  Another Sakigake appointee was Hideyuki Tanaka for the newly 
created post of special assistant to the prime minister. 
  The line around the prime minister was closed with the 
appointment of this Sakigake trio, forming what we imagine when 
we hear of a troop lineup that is so tight as to be virtually 
"leak proof." 
  Nor was this the end of it. A shakeup occurred less than a 
month after Norihiko Narita took up his duties as senior 
(private) secretary to the prime minister. 
  Constantly at the side of prime minister, the senior 
secretary has to work with him as though one in body and spirit. 
Various types have filled the position in the past. If there 
have been "bigwigs" in the position who made suggestions and 
pointed out problems with regard to policy matters, there have 
also been others who acted as liaisons to the mass media and 
still others who were in charge of carrying out the prime 
minister's personal errands. 
  The very nature of the job requires someone whom the prime 
minister can trust. Most often it is a relative or a reporter 
who has been assigned to cover his career over the years and has 
been in constant contact with him. 
  Narita, however, had had almost no face-to-face contact with 
Hosokawa before taking the job. The political conference section 
head of the National Diet Library, Narita was known as an 
authority on research concerning electoral systems. 
  One of Ozawa's "brains" when it came to questions about the 
electoral system, Narita apparently received his appointment 
through Ozawa's recommendation. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura explains Narita's transfer 
less than a month after taking up his post, saying, "Since the 
ruling coalition party had completed work on its political 
reform bill, Narita's duties were finished." 
  No one in Nagata-cho, however, is inclined to accept this 
explanation at face value. 
  According to an Official Residence reporter, "Even after 
becoming the Prime Minister's secretary, Narita was going in and 
out of Ozawa's place. He was probably leaking Official Residence 
information to Ozawa, wasn't he? Because of that, the Sakigake 
trio--Takemura, Hatoyama, and Tanaka--had kept him at a 
respectful distance." 
  Generally, one never hears of the prime minister's head 
secretary being in charge of the formulation of a specific bill. 
That would just never be part of a secretary's job description. 
If he was being sought for his abilities as a specialist on 
election systems, there ought to have been a better, more 
suitable place for him than in the secretary's office. 
  In fact, there is talk that Narita will be one of 
Shinseito's 
candidates for the next lower house election. Being senior 
secretary to the prime minister, even for a short while, sounds 
much better in running for an office than being a section head 
at the National Diet Library, so perhaps Narita didn't lose out 
after all. 
  Thus, the shift toward Sakigake that has been going on in 
the 
Official Residence has been completed. 
  Ozawa, Master Designer and Planner 
  Takemura appears now to be the Official Residence's 
designated "guardsman" and can cross swords on an equal footing 
with people like Ozawa, Shinseito's "strongman behind the 
scenes." 
  Takemura definitely seems to have become a presence for 
Ozawa 
that touches on his nerves. 
  True, compared to Ozawa, who has been reelected to the Diet 
now for his ninth term, Takemura has only been elected to his 
third term. Ozawa also has the experience of having wielded the 
scepter of secretary general for the powerful Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP]. Though Takemura can claim experience as governor, 
in what counts most for the LDP--number of reelected terms--a 
large gap still exists between Ozawa and Takemura. 
  For Ozawa, Takemura must seem like a political "greenhorn." 
  Takemura probably wouldn't agree. Though he may not have 
been 
reelected to as many terms as Ozawa, he has served his home 
state as governor and, being eight years Ozawa's senior, is in 
no way his inferior, Takemura would probably say, when it comes 
to life experience. Being what might be called "tenaciousness," 
Takemura is tough and skilled at persuasion and the art of 
negotiating from his experiences heading local government. 
  Still a graduate student at Nihon University, Ozawa hastily 
entered politics as his father's successor upon the latter's 
death, and has no experience in the real world outside of 
politics. Moreover, always in the political mainstream, first as 
a member of the Tanaka faction and then the Takeshita faction, 
Ozawa might be likened to a greenhouse plant. Used to having 
political authority on his side, he can be tough but is also 
often criticized for his arrogance. 
  Even those who know him well from their days together in the 
Kobuchi faction agree that Ozawa is a man of strong likes and 
dislikes who is known for acting arbitrarily on his own 
authority. 
  During his LDP days, an "Ozawa containment" net was setup, 
probably the result of opposition to his methods. 
  Without having to refer to his recent book, Blueprint 
for Building a New Japan," we know Ozawa is a master 
designer, able to lay out a blueprint for himself based on a 
world view and national vision. 
  Foresight, philosophy, vision--these are all things that are 
indispensable to politicians, and to the degree that these 
qualities are missing in politicians these days, Ozawa's 
presence looms up all the more prominently in our impressions. 
  But he is also self-conceited and has made enemies and 
created rivals. 
  Takemura, Single-Minded Attention to Political 
Reform 
  Takemura is Ozawa's opposite. When he founded and took on 
the 
chairmanship of the Utopia Political Study Group, a forerunner 
to the present Sakigake Party, he was still a freshman in the 
Diet. 
  The impetus to form the group was the Recruit scandal. The 
group started from the desire to study the relationship between 
money and politics. The group gathered information and later 
released its findings (though the latter was not part of its 
initial plan) on the amount of funds each of its 20 members 
spent on an annual basis for political activities. Even for 
first year Diet members, about 116 million yen on average was 
found to be needed, and when these finding were released, they 
caused quite a stir, leading to a ban on political gifts for 
ceremonial occasions by Diet members in their local election 
districts. 
  In the end, Takemura concluded that the only effective way 
to 
reform the political system was to change the electoral system, 
and he was seen running around during the [Toshiki] Kaifu 
administration putting together a proposal for combining 
single-seat constituencies with proportional representation. 
  The director of LDP's Political Reform Promotion 
Headquarters 
was Masayoshi Ito. Its chairman was Masaharu Gotoda. Takemura 
became the reform headquarter's secretary general, a post which 
he kept until he left the party. 
  The relationship between Takemura and Gotoda goes back to 
when Takemura, after graduating from Tokyo University, went to 
the Ministry of Home Affairs for a [job] interview. It was 
Gotoda who was on the hiring line as chief secretary to the 
minister. 
  Takemura is said to have taken part in the student movement, 
but Gotoda stood up for the young applicant, asserting, "The 
Home Affairs Ministry needs that kind of energy." 
  Core members of Takemura's Utopia Study Group became key 
figures in the formation of the Young Dietmen's Forum To Promote 
Political Reform (sponsors, Shigeru Ishiba and Susumu Yanase). 
The group came into existence following the Kaifu 
administration's aborted attempt to get a political reform bill 
passed. 
  Takemura turned his energies toward effecting political 
reform, working in conjunction with this group of young Diet 
members, but around March of this year, all but a few had given 
up any hope of realizing their hopes for reform. 
  At about this time, Yukio Hatoyama, Kenichiro Sato, Takeshi 
Iwaya, and others had already resigned themselves to leaving the 
LDP. The 10 who eventually bolted the party to join Sakigake 
were all members of this young Dietmen's group. 
  Ozawa, on the other hand, stayed with the party even after 
the split-up of the Takeshita faction following Shin Kanemaru's 
resignation from the Diet. To the very end, steps were being 
taken to have Ozawa designated Kanemaru's successor as party 
chairman. After the split, Ozawa and Hata joined hands to form 
their own faction, hesitating until the eleventh hour to secede 
from the party. 
  Advocating electoral reform, the two played a brilliant hand 
in transforming themselves into the "party of reform." But if we 
look back over the road Ozawa has traveled, it is hard to rid 
ourselves completely of the suspicion that his reform arguments 
are just rhetoric being used in a struggle for political power. 
  Coalition's Ability To Govern Questioned 
  Although it is true that, only being in his third term, 
Takemura was hardly in the position to participate in power 
struggles within the LDP or within its factions, still, his 
motives for advocating political reform, in contrast to Ozawa's, 
strike us as being pure. After all, isn't of the reasons that 
the Sakigake people want to draw the line between themselves and 
the Shinseito their opposition to Ozawa and his tendency to 
engage in power struggles? 
  Even if Sakigake joins up with the Japan New Party, it is 
unthinkable that it will get ever together with Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] to form still another new party. 
  It is not certain that the election reform bill will be 
passed, but attention is sure to be focused on the tug-of-war 
between the Shinseito-Komeito camp, which is aiming for a 
two-party system, and the Sakigake-Japan New Party, as well as 
the future direction of the Hosokawa coalition government. As 
long as the Hosokawa coalition stays in power, however, no 
decisive confrontation is likely to occur between Ozawa and 
Takemura. For they know, if they were to cause the collapse of 
the coalition government, they would only be bringing trouble on 
themselves. 
  The Hosokawa coalition is often said to be like a fine piece 
of glasswork. Certainly, an eight party coalition government has 
no precedent in Europe, where most governments are formed 
through coalitions. Nor has there ever been a past case where 
the head of the fifth-ranking party becomes prime minister. 
  But it is a truism that applies not only to governments: an 
object that looks fragile ends up staying intact. That is 
because it is handled with special care so it doesn't break. Of 
course, there are seemingly unbreakable objects which may have 
an internal flaw that causes it to splinter. The ability of the 
Hosokawa coalition government is certain to come under scrutiny 
and questioned, but one thing seems certain: for the time being, 
ruling coalition members are not expected to fight, nor can they 
afford to. 
  The question is Ozawa, the politician. He is a strategist 
and 
the type of politician who shows formidable skills on the 
offensive. How long will he be able to endure the vague 
misgivings of those on watch [around Hosokawa]? 
  Will there be reminders of events two years ago, when his 
high-handed attempts to force the candidacy of Hisanori Isomura 
for the Tokyo gubernatorial race failed? 
  Probably, Takemura will take an unhurried stance, allowing 
himself time to grasp the political situation around him. In 
point of flexibility, he is Ozawa's superior. If these two very 
different men can skillfully mesh gears, the Hosokawa coalition 
government may be able to enjoy an unexpected sense of security 
and well-being. The key to its future is held by these two men.

  [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa met with former 
Labor Minister Toshio Yamaguchi at the prime minister's office 
on the afternoon of 16 January. During the meeting which lasted 
for about an hour, they keenly discussed prospects for political 
reform debates and desirable directions of the coalition 
government. According to Yamaguchi, Hosokawa expressed his 
resolve to stand out firmly to enact the political reform bills. 
Regarding his strategies for the next ordinary Diet session, 
Hosokawa reportedly clarified his stance to maintain and further 
strengthen cooperative relations among the eight coalition 
parties. After the meeting, Yamaguchi told reporters that, 
"while some quarters in the coalition are seeking new grouping, 
the prime minister still considers the eight-party alliance must 
be the foundation of the coalition government." 
  It is believed that those remarks by Hosokawa were made to 
check moves by Akira Yamagishi, chairman of Rengo who recently 
proposed a unification of liberal parties except Komeito and 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party].

  [Text] According to a survey conducted in December by 
MAINICHI SHIMBUN with 100 division directors [kacho] in the 
central government's ministries and agencies, a majority of the 
officials supported the amendment to Article 9 of the 
Constitution. While 43 percent of the respondents said Article 
9 "should remain as it currently is," 46 percent said the 
"amendment is necessary" and 5 percent said "positive efforts 
should be made to amend it." 
  More than half of those polled in the Defense Agency, the 
Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry 
of Construction, and the Ministry of Health and Welfare said 
they support the amendment. But there was a wide range of 
views, including those of moderates in the Ministry of Finance, 
saying "the Peace Constitution needs to be maintained, but 
neither must we make its amendment taboo." Those in the 
Ministry of Home Affairs said: "It is necessary to prepare a 
system through which the nation can positively participate in 
international cooperation." Some in the Science and Technology 
Agency felt "it is necessary to review the Constitution if Japan 
is to carry out its role in building a new world order in the 
post-cold war era, a role befitting its national power. But 
defenders of the Constitution in the Ministry of Transport said: 
"Article 9 may not be fitting to the current situation, but it 
should be left intact as an expression of our ideals." 
  The bureaucrats' positive views on international 
contributions were evident in their answers to questions 
regarding Japan's participation in peacekeeping operations 
[PKO]. Fifty-five percent said: "We should refrain from 
participating in exercises of force, but if we do we should 
participate in them positively." Thirty-one percent said: "We 
should be positive about making international contributions, 
including participation in peacekeeping forces." 
  Meanwhile, only 9 percent said Japan should "rethink" the 
PKO, and no one said Japan should "stop the PKO immediately."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Review of Defense Outline With Broad Vision </F>
Urged] 
  [Text] Is it proper to expand our activities and begin 
dealing with new tasks in addition to what we have been doing? 
It would be a lie if we said we did not feel that way. 
However, reviewing the outline of the defense plan has been a 
pending issue since the end of the cold war. We would like to 
welcome the willingness Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
expressed at his New Year's press conference. 
  The prime minister explained his idea to begin reviewing the 
outline one year earlier than the Defense Agency's schedule, and 
thus complete it during fiscal 1994. Because of this, it is 
said an advisory organization originally scheduled to be placed 
under the jurisdiction of the Defense Agency's director general 
will become an advisory body to the prime minister. 
  It is a major political task to determine Japan's ideal 
future defense in line with a new ideology. It can be said that 
since the prime minister explained his intention to tackle the 
issue himself, that proves he accurately understands the 
importance of the new task. 
  The outline of the current defense plan was formed under the 
Miki cabinet in 1976 as a guideline for building up the nation's 
defense capability when the cold war between East and West was 
moving toward detente. Its goal was to "single-handedly and 
effectively deal with limited and small-scale invasions." It 
was prepared on an idea called "improvement of fundamental 
defense capability." 
  It is said the outline is not designed to deal with threats. 
However, due to the escalation of confrontation between the 
United States and the Soviet Union during the 1980's, the 
outline actually strengthened Japan's defense capability in 
dealing with threats, mainly "potential threats from the Soviet 
Union." 
  Following the 1989 conclusion of the cold war, the Soviet 
Union collapsed in 1991, and the structure of East-West 
confrontation disappeared. Of late, a new source of 
apprehension is Russian rightists coming into existence. 
However, it is probably a political phenomenon. It does not 
mean Russia has begun reconstructing the strong military power 
of the former Soviet Union. Moreover, the Russian economy is so 
weak that Russia is unable to abruptly rebuild a strong military 
power even if it wanted to. 
  If aforesaid views are true, then we can say the military 
threat has been reduced remarkably. Nevertheless, the Japanese 
Government so far has been delaying the process of reviewing its 
defense outline. We feel the government is trying to find a new 
threat. 
  The DPRK's nuclear weapons project and its development of 
the 
Nodong-1 missile, which can be used to attack Japan, are indeed 
causes of anxiety. We may also need to keep our eyes on the 
modernization of Chinese naval force. It seems the frequent 
occurrence of regional conflicts will continue in the future. 
However, it is not a good idea to fuss over these issues, saying 
they are major threats. 
  On the contrary, we think the quality of the threats has 
changed. The new world order which will take the place of the 
cold war is still unclear, and a sense of fear and uncertainly 
is growing. How we deal with these matters should be the basis 
of the new defense outline. 
  To do this, military streamlining alone is not enough. As 
the prime minister said, Japan needs to "voluntarily lead the 
disarmament movement." This is the only way we can clearly show 
Asia that Japan does not intend to become a major military 
power, or will not use military power to back its diplomacy. 
  Defense authorities have strengthened their idea to use a 
plan designed to reduce the full number of Self-Defense Forces 
[SDF] personnel from 180,000 to 150,000 as an answer to the 
"voluntary disarmament." However, the SDF has never maintained 
180,000 members. Currently, it has only 153,000 personnel. 
  Direct invasion by a foreign enemy is unlikely. Civil war is 
beyond imagination. We urge the government to seriously study 
the possibility of forming a UN cooperation team by venturing to 
reduce the scale of the Ground Self-Defense Forc. 
  The new outline should serve as a guideline for building 
Japan's defense capability. At the same time, it should also 
become Japan's message to the world. In this sense, rather than 
relying on the knowledge of specialists, the government must 
study a new defense doctrine from broad perspectives, taking 
Japanese common sense into consideration.

  [Text] Discord between the Prime Minister's Office and the 
Defense Agency [DA] over reviewing an outline of the defense 
plan, which is the guideline for building Japan's defense 
capability, is becoming apparent. At a press conference held on 
10 January, Shigeru Hatakeyama, administrative vice minister for 
the DA, commented on a plan to review the "outline" of the 
defense plan. He stressed the importance of the DA's 
fundamental policy, saying that as in the past the DA will map 
out a new defense concept by next fall, and the new concept will 
be reflected in DA budgets beginning in fiscal 1996 following 
completion of the mid-term defense plan. Prime Minister Horihiro 
Hosokawa explained his intention to incorporate a new outline 
into the budget for fiscal 1995 by reviewing the current 
"outline" this summer, one year earlier than originally 
scheduled. Hatakeyama's remark is tantamount to sabotaging the 
prime minister's plan. 
  Touching on the issue of reviewing the "outline," Hatakeyama 
said on 10 January: "The DA is making preparations to map out 
the rough structure of a new defense concept by the end of 
fiscal 1994." Moreover, he commented on the possibility of 
forming a project team within the DA for reviewing the 
"outline," saying "we will do that one of these days." Thus he 
emphasized a prearranged plan to study the possibility of 
forming a DA study team apart from the advisory organ to the 
prime minister. 
  As for ironing out differences between the Mid-Term Defense 
Buildup Plan for 1991-1995 and a new Defense Buildup Plan, 
Hatakeyama said: "It is said the advisory organ to the prime 
minister will begin directing its plan by this summer. But it 
is impossible to predict what will happen to the Mid-Term 
Defense Buildup Plan unless you know its conclusion." 
  Among other things, the prime minister said at a news 
conference on 4 January: "The world is moving towards detente. 
The time is ripe for Japan to review its ideal defense 
capability." The DA is not quite agreeing with the prime 
minister because it is unable to satisfy its concern that the 
prime minister may easily review the "outline" and trim the 
defense budget for fiscal 1995. At the same time, it is 
uncertain as to what degree the prime minister will review the 
"outline." The DA also wants to take the lead in reviewing the 
defense capability level and other matters in lieu of the 
advisory organ to the prime minister. Therefore, it seems a 
process of coordination between the Prime Minister's Office and 
the DA will become harder than before.

  [Text] Noboru Hoshuyama, director of the Defense Agency 
[DA] Director General's Secretariat, speaking at a 17 January 
news conference on DA plans to procure surveillance satellites, 
said: "On the prerequisite that there are no political 
constraints, it is desirable to have surveillance satellites 
from the standpoint of improving intelligence capabilities." He 
thus indicated hopes that the DA would have such satellites in 
the future. 
  Hoshuyama also admitted that "research and studies are being 
conducted on the usefulness of surveillance satellites" at 
various DA bureaus and departments and at staff offices of the 
Ground, Maritime, and Air Defense Forces.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Tsutomu Namikawa: "Responses to </F>
Securities Market Emergencies for Which Secret Incantations Are 
Unacceptable"] 
  [Text] The operating crisis at Cosmo Securities has 
generated increased conversational interest in the topic of 
securities bankruptcies. Not a few people are of the opinion 
that bankruptcy would have been more appropriate than a rescue. 
However, at the same time, ever so many fewer argue for setting 
in place an infrastructure to eliminate from the market the 
impact of a securities firm's going bankrupt. Any argument for 
the appropriateness of bankruptcy will never be anything more 
than irrational unless policies are put in place to avoid 
securities settlement risks along with mechanisms to isolate the 
impact of bankruptcies from market trading. 
<H3>  The Myth of No Bankruptcies in the Securities Industry 
"Compared to a bank, the bankruptcy of a securities company 
would have trifling impact." One hears this said again and again 
of late. This may be true, if we take into consideration the 
degree impact such a bankruptcy would have on the financial 
order. However, in reality the issue is not something that can 
be written off so easily. </H3>
  To begin with, as is the case with financial institutions 
and 
the funds settlement system, settlements involving securities 
transactions (securities settlements) are bolstered by a myth of 
no bankruptcies among securities companies. Nevertheless, these 
last one or two years the mechanism of funds settlement has been 
modified through a process "best called a revolutionary reform 
in awareness" (a top-ranking city bank). Specifically, the 
change involves the establishment of same day settlements in the 
all-bank system which handles funds settlements between banks 
for domestic exchange, on-line CD's, etc. 
  The essence of this is something that determines the actual 
goal (conceptually already existing) of not giving rise to 
obstacles in the settlement system for participating financial 
institutions even should unexpected circumstances arise and it 
is certainly correct to label this self-denial of the myth of no 
bankruptcies. As a philosophy underpinning the framework of the 
settlement system, it is nothing short of a Copernican 
revolution. 
  As for converting to this, securities settlements remain as 
before. Bankruptcies of securities companies are not actually 
being contemplated. This is despite talk of the business slump 
among securities companies. 
  For example, one person connected with the securities 
business said about the actual situation, "In the final 
analysis, the securities industry has not rid itself of the idea 
that it is a private market." 
  This is a cold indication of the thinking that, even though 
irregularities do at times occur in settlements related to 
securities transactions, because they are dealing with their 
Kabuto-cho confederates, this somehow can be solved through a 
few secret incantations. 
  The origin of this thinking stems from a total belief in the 
myth of no bankruptcies. However, should a securities company 
one day go bankrupt in carrying out a large volume of securities 
transactions, talk would change. Surely the facile conception of 
"What might happen?" would be shaken by a harsh reality. 
  What is the problem with the current securities settlement 
system? The possibility that a chained series of failures might 
occur in the system. 
<H5>  Had Cosmo Gone Bankrupt </H5>
  Faced with an operational crisis, Cosmo Securities avoided 
the worst through rescue measures on the part of Daiwa Bank. 
Although popular opinion is varied regarding this, more than a 
few feel they should have been allowed to go bankrupt. 
  However, there is another side to this. What would actually 
have happened if Cosmo had become technically insolvent? Under 
the current securities settlement system the failure of Cosmo 
probably would have reverberated through the system and in the 
worst case other securities firms could have been drawn into the 
same position. Had that happened, the current securities 
settlement system could not have quarantined the risk. 
  Let's try to look this in concrete terms. The Cosmo 
Securities operational crisis came to light on 13 August. What 
would have been the outcome of the stock and bond trades made by 
Cosmo up to the day the company would have entered default? 
  Stock settlements take place on the fourth day following the 
trade. Consequently, assuming that all were business days, Cosmo 
would have been unable to meet settlement following the 13th 
for transactions made on 10, 11, and 12 August. Thus, the 
company would have been unable to pay the proceeds of trades 
made in behalf of sellers of stock and could not have fulfilled 
its obligations on demand. 
  Which is to say, because in four-day settlements the 
certificates are also transferred on the fourth day, in a manner 
of speaking we could say that the flow of funds and certificates 
would have come to a halt. However, in terms of risk, being 
unable to sell when one wants to sell causes harm and being 
unable to purchase when one wants to buy entails losses as well. 
  This is not all. Strictly speaking, this is tantamount to 
default. 
  This is because securities firms use checks for funds 
settlements for some situations. For example, the date when 
Cosmo Securities would have had to issue a check as settlement 
for a 10 August buy was 13 August, the fourth day. The date when 
the bank (the bank having the account of the seller in the 
transaction) would have taken delivery of the check, would have 
honored it and transferred it into the seller's account would 
have been one day later, 14 August. Consequently, although 
formally speaking it appears that the funds settlement occurs 
the same day as the certificate transfer, in reality the seller 
would have received the funds paid by Cosmo Securities the day 
after the certificate had been transferred. 
  Moreover, what we must consider here is the fact that Cosmo 
Securities was bankrupt. Assuming that funds remain in the 
account of a business that is bankrupt makes no sense. Rather, 
it is more realistic to assume that the funds to cover the 
amount of the check would not have been in the account. 
Consequently, if we understand this fact, the bank on which the 
check was drawn would return the check issued between banks in 
the funds settlement marked insufficient funds. Consequently, 
Cosmo Securities would have been in a stop payment status and in 
the end the recipient of the funds would have sustained a loss. 
  Put another way, settlement would not occur on the fourth 
day 
following a sale and would not actually happen until the sixth 
day, allowing two days for the check to clear, at which time the 
trade would fall through. Thus, the settlement risk following 
the transfer of the certificate would have continued two days 
beyond the settlement date. 
<H5>  Are the Emergency Reserve Funds Adequate? </H5>
  It is not that this issue of securities settlement risk has 
not been debated before now. On the contrary, an international 
inquiry was conducted in 1989 into creating an infrastructure 
that would avoid settlement risks and a report was issued on the 
securities settlement system as it then was. This was the 
initiative of the "Group of 30" (G30) leading countries 
concerned with securities. 
  The report made nine recommendations aimed at improving the 
securities settlement system. Those applying to Japan were: (1) 
netting; and (2) the simultaneous settlement of funds and 
securities. 
  First, (1) netting being a structure for settling the claims 
and obligations existing between parties A and B involved in a 
transaction. Although netting between two parties (bilateral 
netting) is already widely employed in Japan, the problem is 
conducting multilateral transactions involving three or more 
parties (multilateral netting). 
  There is no way to put this into practice other than to 
establish a settlement agency to function between the parties to 
the transaction. Thus, the settlement agency and the company 
representative involved in a transaction could draw on an 
emergency fund earmarked for settlements where there is 
nonpayment of settlement funds. In reality, arrangements would 
be made in advance to replenish the fund in anticipation of 
payments that would draw down the fund. 
  Although such a system is widespread among the securities 
markets of Europe and the United States, regrettably it has been 
introduced into Japan only in the Money Futures Exchange. The 
Tokyo Stock Exchange appears to have a function similar to this; 
however, the reality is that its fund must be judged unreliable. 
  The emergency fund of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which is 
money for losses and indemnification for breach of contract now 
totals only a little less than 6 billion yen. This amount is 
actually quite paltry were truly large stock transactions to be 
involved. Total losses stemming from default on trades is the 
"net base." Moreover, such losses are indemnified by this 
reserve fund for "occasions when liquidation or full payment of 
losses due to nonpayment of debt cannot be made in accordance 
with the principle of good will, or with business and other 
rules." Consequently, on the surface we cannot easily compare 
transaction amounts. 
  Although we must not lose sight of this point, at the same 
time, as we discussed earlier, in the case of stock trades with 
settlement on the fourth day, it is unforgivable that there 
should be a one day difference between payment and transfer that 
could give rise to losses. Is 6 billion yen enough to cover any 
losses? There are those within the securities industry who are 
saying, "The fund does not in reality suppose the possibility of 
bankruptcies" (leading securities firm). 
  According to the rules of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 
governing body may decide that the exchange can gather fresh 
funds from company representatives in case the emergency fund is 
drawn down. However, one must assume that were a major 
securities bankruptcy to occur, a focused and unlimited fund 
would be required. The burden placed on the company 
representative would not be trivial. 
<H5>  Government Bond Trading Moving Toward Delivery versus Payment </H5>
  Most importantly, a discussion of the fund scope is not the 
primary consideration from the viewpoint of alleviating 
securities settlement risks. The reason is that this is nothing 
more than after-the-fact management once a stop payment occurs. 
Instead, the highest priority topic in terms of a risk policy is 
"preventing the occurrence of risk through eliminating the time 
differential between the two separate settlements of the funds 
and the certificates." 
  The degree of settlement risk is manifested in the 
mathematical formula, "the pending settlement amount times the 
pending settlement time." Consequently, reducing the amount of 
the pending settlement and shortening the pending settlement 
time would be effective in lowering the risk occurrence rate. If 
transfer of the negotiable securities by the seller and 
settlement of the funds by the buyer are accomplished 
simultaneously, theoretically the risk drops to zero. Herein is 
the reason for the G30's recommending the implementation of 
provision (2), simultaneous securities and funds settlements 
(popularly called DVP [delivery versus payment]). 
  Accordingly, if we examine Japan's securities settlement 
system, at first glance it appears that simultaneous settlement 
is a reality. That is because certificates and funds have to be 
liquidated on the same day through a settlement structure that 
is the fourth day for stocks and five and 10 days for BB 
(broker's broker) settlements involving government bond trades. 
However, we discussed earlier that it is not a reality in the 
case of stock trades. 
  For fixed period contracts involving government bond trades 
that are handled as broker's broker trades, settlements are made 
for a set day double the five days for stock trades. As for the 
settlement method, although in general account transfers are 
used, in some cases checks are used. In these cases, the buyer's 
funds settlement is delivered by check the day before 
settlement. For this reason, once the check drawn on the bank 
maintaining the company's account is presented to the bank 
holding the seller's account, in reality a one-day delay occurs 
before the money is actually deposited into the seller's 
account. If we consider this in parallel with the transfer of 
the certificate, we find that with the buyer delivers a check 
one day prior to transfer and that there is still a one-day 
delay pending settlement. 
  Moreover, in terms of account transfers, certificate and 
funds settlement times do not coincide at all. 
  Moreover, this does not suffice as an explanation for 
broker's broker transactions. Which is to say, this is because 
in these cases the buyer and seller have not made a mutual 
contract on the same trade. For example, in the case of Nippon 
Sogo Securities, which maintains a representative broker's 
broker market and which has a dealer's license, the company can 
make trades independently and do settlements standing between 
buyer and seller. That is, the seller sells to Nippon Sogo 
Securities even as on the other side the buyer buys from them. 
Consequently, should it happen one day that the company does not 
receive the certificates and furthermore that the funds 
settlement is delayed, the stop payment order for the debt falls 
to Nippon Sogo Securities. In this sense, as with funds 
settlements with domestic exchanges, it must cover the 
occurrence directly with the settling parties. 
  Should we employ forward leaning evaluation of the current 
structure as "a structure in which unexpected situations are 
quarantined," or, improve the system with the judgment that 
"each contract carries risk?" The latter is now the goal being 
concretely examined by the involved parties. The basis for this 
is the fundamental recognition that, "for not being a rational 
system, the market will be shaken by unexpected events. It is 
extremely important that unexpected situations which occur for 
specific securities firms not reverberate through the market" (a 
leading securities firm). 
  Accordingly, what is currently being put into place is the 
move to DVP. The concept is that simultaneous settlements will 
take place with funds transfers going through Bank of Japan 
(BOJ) current deposit accounts and certificate transfers through 
the BOJ network. For government bond bookkeeping, a government 
bonds transfer settlement system was introduced in 1980 and 
since May 1990 the transfer business has been on-line using the 
BOJ network. Regarding certificate transfers there are no real 
problems. 
<H5>  Driving a Porsche on Farm Paths </H5>
  Securities firms and banks that participate in the broker's 
broker market and who carry out major trades in government bonds 
have current deposit and government bond accounts with the BOJ. 
In addition, if market participants who have government bond 
accounts but not current deposit accounts could make use of 
accounts with "proxy settlement banks," there would be no 
problems. 
  The introduction of a simultaneous settlement system which 
ties together both infrastructures concerned with settlements is 
planned for this coming March [1994]. Tokyo Stock Exchange 
government bond transactions similarly are being made DVP. For 
the leading security firms involved in the government bond 
market, one-time settlement amounts reach several trillion yen. 
To respond to emergencies in this gigantic market, major moves 
toward conversion to DVP next year are under way. 
  Most important, settlement risks inherent in securities 
trades despite this do not disappear entirely. As ever, a 
pending settlement time for stock trades continues to exist and 
in the case of general bonds other than government bonds, 
settlements face a tougher situation. Because the emphasis up to 
now has been on holding rather than on circulation in the case 
of general bonds, it has been difficult to discuss settlement 
risks. However, given the importance of a set number of days for 
transfers, the present system has serious problems in that "the 
completion of the name transfer and the funds settlement do not 
at all coincide" (leading securities firm). 
  As it is, should the circulation of general bonds gain in 
frequency, we can anticipate that, "While funds settlement will 
go forward, the ownership of the certificate will remain 
unclear." A person connected with securities points out that 
even now, even if trading is carried from A to E in a short 
period, "By abbreviating the transfer bookkeeping procedures 
from B to D, there still will be the problem of managing the 
transfer of ownership from A directly to E on settlement day." 
Accordingly, should a related securities bankruptcy occur, there 
will be "utter chaos." 
  It goes without saying that stipulations for speedy 
settlements are needed in order to develop the securities 
market. However, what I am talking about is that an 
infrastructure that will not present obstacles to settlement 
needs to be put in place. One person connected with the 
securities industry expressed this metaphorically as follows. 
  "Are we going to drive a tractor along farm paths or a 
Porsche on the autobahn? These are the only options." The 
current securities market seems to be driving a Porsche along 
farm paths that even now have yet to be properly maintained.

Department, Economic Planning Agency: "Elimination of Domestic 
and Foreign Price Differential Through Structural Reform"] 
  [Text] Enhance Efficiency by Encouraging 
Competition--Eliminate Policy of Protecting Agriculture and 
Relax Controls 
  [Boxed item: 1. Japan has become one of the nations of 
the world where commodity price levels are the highest as a 
result of the rise in the value of the yen. 
  2. The domestic-foreign price differential issue is a 
problem which is deeply intertwined with the structural problems 
of the Japanese economy and there is a need for resolution of 
the structural problem from the standpoint of the consumer 
through actions such as elimination of agricultural protection 
policies, wholesale alteration of the indirect tax system, 
stricter enforcement of antimonopoly laws, promotion of 
competition through relaxation of economic controls, reform of 
social controls, increased efficiency in the consumer sector, 
and increased support for policies that encourage business 
efforts at improving efficiency and productivity. 
  3. These measures will not only lower domestic 
commodity prices, but can be expected to have the effect of 
shrinking the domestic-foreign price differentials caused by 
excessive foreign exchange valuations.] 
<H5>  Cause Lies With Import Quotas and Price Supports </H5>
  The value of the yen against the dollar is currently 
fluctuating around 105 yen to the dollar, increasing in value 
3.4-fold in 20 years since the inception of the floating 
exchange rate. The impact has been the placement of Japan in a 
status where it has one of the world's highest commodity price 
levels. 
  During the days when the dollar was valued at 360 yen, 
Japanese commodity price levels were low compared to Europe and 
the United States, and Japanese tourists and officials stationed 
overseas were surprised by the limited buying power of the 
dollar in the United States compared to its value outside the 
United States. However, today, the situation has been completely 
reversed. 
  As reflected in the following table, an Economic Planning 
Agency [EPA] survey of domestic-foreign price differentials 
revealed that commodity prices as viewed from an overall 
combined living expense perspective were relatively higher in 
Tokyo than they were in New York, London, Paris, or Berlin. 
Currently, the yen has risen in value in relation to all other 
foreign currencies, and it is anticipated that the 
domestic-foreign price differential will continue to expand 
during 1993.

Footnotes: (1) Values shown for New York, London, and Paris are 
extrapolations based on survey data as of November 1988, November 1990, 
and November 1991, respectively.(2) Number of items surveyed covered 330 
to 400 items. Brands were not specified, but the survey covered items 
which traded in higher volumes. Whenever quality and standards did not 
match strictly, strict comparisons of individual items was difficult and 
attention should be focused on the fact that data on foodstuffs reflect 
differences in dietary habits. (3) Data on foreign urban areas were 
obtained from surveys conducted by the Price Bureau of EPA and the Japan 
External Trade Organization. Data on Tokyo were obtained from the 
Management and Coordination Agency's "Survey of Retail Commodity 
Statistics" and survey by the Price Bureau. Prices reflect retail prices 
which include taxes. (4) Foreign currency exchange rates reflect averages 
for 1992 as a whole. 


  The question is, how was this domestic-foreign price 
differential created? The following three factors are 
conceivable, if we exclude temporary factors such as delays in 
making adjustments for changes in foreign currency exchange 
rates. 
  The first factor concerns the issue of foreign trade goods 
which are exposed to international competition through export 
and import actions. Prices of foreign trade goods should 
stabilize at international price levels, unless they are exposed 
to special situations. However, in Japan such goods are isolated 
from international price competition because of import quotas 
and price support systems and despite efforts to lower prices 
through productivity improvements, the major rise in the value 
of the yen has caused a very sizable differential in domestic 
and foreign prices of such items as agricultural commodities. 
  High tariff rates for such commodities as raw sugar ranging 
at fixed rates of thousands of yen per ton do not isolate 
specific commodities from price competition such as in the case 
of import quotas, but the rising yen effectively boosts the 
tariff rates and even if the benefits of the higher yen are 
passed on to the consumer, the end result is a considerable 
increase in the multiple of the domestic and foreign price 
differential. Other commodities such as textile products and 
liquor and petroleum products are similarly impacted in a major 
way in terms of tariffs and related taxes. 
  Oligopolistic price formations by manufacturers also serve 
as 
cause for domestic-foreign price differentials. In those 
instances where major domestic-foreign price differentials exist 
despite the lack of obvious import barriers, conceivable are 
such actions as prevention of parallel imports by exclusive 
import agents, actions which restrict competition through the 
formation of marketing affiliations by domestic manufacturers, 
and the difficulties faced in arranging for parallel imports 
under government controls imposed on cosmetics. 
<H5>  Lagging Productivity in Non-Foreign Trade Goods Sector </H5>
  The second factor concerns the problem with non-foreign 
trade 
goods which are not exposed to international competition. In the 
case of Japan, the differential in productivity between the 
manufacturing industries and other industries is conspicuously 
large compared to other nations. When one considers that foreign 
currency exchange rates are based primarily on international 
competitiveness in the manufacturing sector, this differential 
causes a disparity between purchasing parity relative to overall 
living expenses and the real foreign exchange rates. Further, 
since foreign trade goods are passed to the consumer after 
adding distribution costs, high marketing costs translate into 
high domestic retail prices. 
  This sector is affected by dropping foreign trade goods 
prices, but since it is not exposed to direct price-lowering 
pressures from price drops by competitors, there is a lack of 
actions to enhance productivity through such movements as 
increased manufacturing efficiency, enhancement of products by 
high-value-added measures, and withdrawals from unprofitable 
sectors as seen in the foreign trade goods sector, thus leading 
to expanding productivity differentials between foreign trade 
and non-foreign trade goods sectors. 
  The non-foreign trade goods sector is composed of many 
regulated industries which are subject to market controls 
relative to new market entrants and pricing. Such restrictions 
are a strong probable cause for delays in enhancing long-term 
productivity. Further, excessive profits accompanying controls 
in such industries are conceivably distributed to workers as 
part of their wages providing for wage levels that are higher 
than other industries and a situation in which such costs are 
transferred to the consumer in the form of higher prices. 
  The third factor concerns the issue of production factors 
such as land which cannot be moved on an international basis and 
labor whose movements are restricted. Generally speaking, 
requisite prices such as for land and wages and commodity price 
levels have a tendency to rise in economies that enjoy high 
growth rates based on increased productivity accompanying 
economic growth. The relationship between per capita gross 
domestic product (GDP) as converted into gross national product 
and purchasing parity, and commodity price levels based on GDP 
have been in considerable turmoil since the foreign currency 
exchange adjustments agreed upon in the 1985 Plaza Accord, but 
it is obvious that commodity price levels tend to be higher in 
nations with a higher per capita GDP. 
  A considerable portion of high Japanese commodity prices can 
be explained by the high income levels, but they still exceed by 
12 percent the levels that can be covered by such an 
explanation. However, the recent rise in the yen is deemed to 
have caused an expanding disparity in Japanese price levels 
which is equal to or in excess of that of the North European 
nations where the degree of disparity from regression lines is 
the largest. 
  When the foregoing situation and findings of the living 
expense survey are combined, the structure--wherein a major 
domestic-foreign price differential is aggravated on a living 
expense basis in excess of the overall economic cost basis in 
the form of high consumer prices for food, clothing, and 
footwear which are highly weighted in terms of consumer 
goods--becomes obvious. Additionally, high land prices in Tokyo 
have a conspicuous impact relative to principal urban areas 
throughout the world. 
<H5>  Call for Bold Policies Emphasizing Consumer Interests </H5>
  A review of domestic-foreign price differential factors in 
this manner enables us to understand that the differentials are 
deeply intertwined with various structural problems. The issue 
of domestic-and foreign price differentials cannot be resolved 
through clever manipulations and requires work on solutions to 
structural issues from a standpoint which emphasizes the 
consumer. Keywords applicable to such an approach are promotion 
of competition and enhancement of efficiency and productivity. 
If I were to present a self-styled approach to reducing the 
domestic-foreign price differential, it would be as follows: 
  First, I would convert the current agriculture protection 
policy from one of maintaining prices to one of direct aid. 
Current policy merely serves to expand the disadvantages 
suffered by consumers relative to advantages enjoyed by farmers. 
  Second, I would completely reform high tariffs such as for 
textile products and the indirect tax system for petroleum and 
liquor. We should also study the feasibility of converting 
current indirect tax liabilities hidden in the prices of such 
necessities as foodstuffs to a tax system where the liabilities 
are clearly and broadly indicated. 
  Third, I would promote competition based on stricter 
implementation of the antimonopoly laws and relaxation of 
economic controls. Especially desirable would be the 
establishment of a surveillance system by the Fair Trade 
Commission to oversee import prices and foreign prices. 
Relaxation of controls should include not only flexibility in 
price controls, but lowering of barriers to new market entrants 
through abolishment of restrictions on new market entrants 
because of excess supply and easing of restrictions relative to 
market entry as well as withdrawal. 
  Fourth, I would revise societal regulations concerning 
safety. I would revise the contents of regulations which are 
excessively strict, introduce product liability laws on matters 
which can be covered by the principle of self-responsibility and 
simultaneously abolish regulations which can be covered by the 
new laws. 
  Fifth, I would reinforce policies which support business 
efforts in the area of enhancing the efficiency of 
consumer-related sectors and promoting productivity. Policies 
which were previously concentrated on export industries and 
leading-edge technologies must be expanded to circulation, 
marketing, and other services. 
  These measures should lead to lower domestic commodity 
prices 
and expanded imports through improved market access and expanded 
domestic demand, alleviate high-yen pressures occasioned by 
structural distortions and can be expected to have the effect of 
reducing domestic-foreign price differentials caused by 
excessive currency valuations.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, January 14 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
state security organs should not play a role of political 
police, announces the new chief of the State Security Central 
Department, Lieutenant Colonel D. Sandag in interview with 
correspondent of the newspaper ARDIYN ERH. D. Sandag notes that 
the functions of the department are intelligence and 
counterintelligence work, the state guarding. The department 
should not be engaged in other activity, except the mentioned 
functions, says D. Sandag. He considers expedient to revise the 
law on state security organs, which was adopted in 1992. 
  This law, he notes, was based on the old structures, methods 
and forms. Of activity of the previous state security organs, 
D. Sandag considers as necessary promotion of young people, the 
raising of their qualification. 
  Answering questions of the correspondent, D. Sandag stresses 
that those working at state security organs as military 
servicemen should observe a strict discipline, abstain from 
belonging to any party, as it is envisaged by the law. In this 
sense, he says, forces in opposition should not exist in state 
security organs. 
  Concerning the statement by Colonel L. Sanjaasuren on 
intentions to liquidate the materials about abuse of power and 
bribery by some high officials, which are kept in the State 
Security Department, D. Sandag notes that, in his view, such 
serious violations do not exist, and that the accusations 
brought might be based on a striving for winning authority, by 
using the differences of political forces. D. Sandag notes that 
the issues, which were touched upon by Colonel L. Sanjaasuren, 
are being now checked up by a special commission of the 
parliament and the public will be get acquainted with results in 
its time [sentence as received]. In D. Sandag's view, the 
recent changes of the leadership of the State Security Central 
Department have been connected with shortcomings in their 
activity.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, January 15 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
Mongolian Parliament at night from 14 to 15 January considered 
behind closed doors in the course of 6 hours the findings of the 
working group on checking up of the information about 
involvement of some state high officials in bribery and abuse of 
official powers and postponed continuation of the hearing till 
Monday, January 17. At the state Great Hural sitting, which was 
held yesterday from 6 PM up to 2 AM today, besides lawmakers 
present were the Mongolian president, the head of the 
president's administration, the president's adviser on national 
security issues, the head of the parliament chancellery, two of 
its deputy heads, the head of the parliament press service, and 
the head of the state security service. 
  Besides the findings of the working group, submitted was to 
the parliament a strictly secret material on the scent of the 
checkup work containing, seemingly, some concrete data and 
facts, and also a statement of the lawmakers from the opposition 
in the Parliament A. Ganbaatar, T. Elbegdorj, who worked in this 
group [sentence as received]. The findings of the working 
group, which carried out the checkup work from 28 December up to 
12 January at the State Security Central Department and the 
Central Police Department and which was set up on the initiative 
of the Parliament opposition, contain a conclusion that the 
statement made by the former head of the counterintelligence 
service about involvement of the State Great Hural Chairman N. 
Bagabandi, the Parliament Vice Chairman J. Gombojab, and the 
Prime Minister P. Jasray in bribery and abuse of powers is 
groundless and not confirmed. In this document appeared are for 
the first time also names of the state Great Hural member, 
leader of the biggest oppositional party Mongolian National 
Democratic Party [MNDP] D. Ganbold, the [words indistinct] 
member, and member of the MNDP S. Zorig. But, as it is pointed 
out in the findings, also materials concerning D. Ganbold and S. 
Zorig did not confirm their participation in abuse of powers. 
  In the statement made by the lawmakers from the Parliament 
opposition A. Ganbaatar and T. Elbegdorj there is a disagreement 
with the findings of the working group on the grounds that the 
group has not given any assessment to a sudden removal of the 
head of the State Security Service and has not stated reasons 
for that. On the other hand, as it is said in the statement, 
despite the presence of serious data and materials, concerning 
the Parliament head, the deputy head and the prime minister, the 
working group deviated from giving a true assessment, and what 
is more was guided by concealment and intercession in its 
actions. 
  At the end of the first day of hearing the working group the 
head of the Mongolian State P. Ochirbat has taken a floor. He 
expressed his position on this issue. 
  As it was decided to continue consideration of the findings 
of the working group in Parliament next week, close of the State 
Great Hural autumn session was also postponed.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, January 17 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- In 
connection with a completing here autumn session of the Great 
State Parliament of Mongolia Deputy Chairman of the Parliament 
J. Gombojab has held a press conference for Mongolian and 
foreign newsmen. He said that the Mongolian Parliament has 
approved 19 new laws and made changes and amendments to the 12 
laws and issued 40 resolutions during the autumn session. 
  He admits that the Parliament has not succeeded to discuss 
all the laws scheduled to be considered at first which was 
connected with a lack of a conception of legislative initiative 
on the part of the Great State Hural and the insufficient 
quality of the draft laws themselves. A number of most 
significant laws of civil code including those on land and 
securities are being worked out in order to submit them to the 
Parliament during its autumn session.

"According to the prognosis of the Russian specialists our 
country has uranic ore reserves worth of 1.5 million tons. This 
is not a small figure and Mongolia needs to appear on the world 
market. Jointly with Russia and the U.S.A. we will exploit the

from this year," said the general director of the Geological 
Research Department of the Ministry of Geology and Mineral 
Resources of Mongolia G. Jamsrandorj [spelling as received]. He 
refuted the rumours about taking on a long-term lease by Russia

compensation of the external debt of Mongolia and said that the 
issues are being discussed about changing the terms of the 
earlier signed agreements and that the sides agreed in principle 
of foundation of a joint enterprise. 
  According G. Jamsrandorj, prices of uranic ore on the world 
market will start increasing in 5-7 years, as in the 21st 
century atomic energy will become a basic source of electric 
energy in the world. Taking this into consideration, the 
ministry has founded an independent company "Uranium" for 
establishment of contacts with the World Nuclear Energy Agency

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, January 17 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
Mongolian-Russian border line continues to be violated in 
reference to its Mongolian-Tuvinian part with the purposes of 
smuggling and rustling. Only for the first half of the month

Baruunturuun Somons of the Uvs Aymag and then run away back 
through the border. This is reported to the MONTSAME 
correspondent in the Uvs Aymag. 
  Such cases of crossing illegally the Mongolian-Tuvinian

  [Text] Beloved comrades: We are extremely saddened to be 
informed of the passing away of Comrade Phoumi Vongvichit. 
During the revolutionary movement, he established an 
unforgettably fine model practice in the history of the struggle 
of the courageous people. From that period, he devoted himself 
to the tasks against colonialism and imperialism for the sake of 
national independence. Comrade Phoumi Vongvichit always honestly 
adhered to his ideal of patriotism and [word indistinct]. This 
was shown during the highly responsible performance of his 
duties throughout the period when a new life for Laos was being 
created and the party and state were being built, as well as in 
other activities. The passing away of Comrade Phoumi Vongvichit 
means the Lao People's Revolutionary Party has lost an honest 
and virtuous senior citizen. It is also the loss of an intimate 
friend for the communists and people of Cuba. However, we are 
confident that the comrades who participated in the past 
struggles with him and the determined and courageous Lao people 
will carry on his tasks, to which he devoted himself throughout 
his life. 
  Through the comrades, we convey our deepest sorrow to the 
Party Central Committee, the government, and the people of Laos, 
as well as to his relatives and family.

  [Text] Jakarta, KOMPAS -- PT Prima Comexindo Trading, a 
national trade services firm, is currently using Bandar Abbas in 
Iran as an important transit point for the shipment of its 
export commodities to the former Soviet republics. Greater 
efficiency and benefit is derived from utilizing the seaport in 
the Islamic Republic of Iran and by avoiding the maritime 
transportation route in the continuously troubled Ukaranian 
region. 
  In a statement to KOMPAS at the Sukarno-Hatta international 
airport on Saturday 8 January, Hashim Jojohadikusumo, President 
Director of PT Prima Comexindo Trading stated to KOMPAS that in 
future Bandar Abbas will become an important transit port for 
the shipment of Indonesian export commodities to the former 
Soviet republics. 
  According to him, the company shipped six containers loaded 
with consignments of Indonesian ready-made garments to Tashkent 
in October 1993. The consignments were found to be intact. 
Hashim said, "The consignments only proceeded to Tashkent after 
our careful study regarding the shipment of six containers 
through Bandar Abbas." 
  According to the report forwarded by his company 
representative based in Bandar Abbas, the transhipment of the 
consignment at the Iranian port was rapid, safe, and the storage 
charges are very competitive. He said, "That is the reason we 
decided to use the port as a transit point for the shipment of 
our commodities to the former Soviet republics." 
  It took only 47 days for the six containers to arrive in 
Tashkent. Hashim added that there are two benefits to be 
derived from using the new trade route. First, the competitively 
short period in shipping commodities to their destinations 
compared with the trade routes in West Europe and some others 
that were previously used by PT Prima Comexindo. Second, the 
journey of the commodities through Bandar Abbas is much safer by 
avoidng the continuously troubled Ukaranian region.

  [Text] Jakarta, Jan 20 (ANTARA) -- Head of information 
service of Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) Brigadier General 
Syarwan Hamid here on Thursday denied rumours saying that the 
ABRI commander-in-chief will be replaced early this year. 
  "It was untrue. There would be no such replacement," he told 
the press after the transfer of the post of ABRI's social and 
political affairs chief of staff from Lieutenant General 
Hariyoto P.S. to Major General R. Hartono. 
  He said that he has lately been questioned whether the ABRI 
chief would be replaced. 
  "I should reiterate that there will be no such a 
replacement," he said. 
  ANTARA sources said that the possibility of the ABRI chief 
replacement was on stage following a speculation on the 
retirement of the ABRI chief by the end of this year. 
  On the occasion the ABRI spokesman revealed that the 
governor 
of the National Defense Institute (Lemhanas) will be held by 
Major General Muntojib, replacing Major General R. Hartono. 
  "Muntojib's post as ABRI's staff and command school (Sesko) 
director will be transferred to Major General Theo Syafei, who 
is now the Udayana regional military commander," he added. 
  He said that Brigadier General Adang Ruchiatna will take the 
post to be left by Major General Theo Syafei.

  [Text] Jakarta, Jan 20 (ANTARA) -- State-owned oil company 
Pertamina is offering twelve new oil fields to domestic and 
foreign investors wishing to invest in this upstream industry in 
1994 on a production-sharing [contract] (PSC) basis, the 
company's president director, Faisal Abda'u, said. 
  Accompanied by some members of the company's board of 
directors, Abda'u told the press here Wednesday that aside from 
the twelve new oil fields, eighteen other oil fields were still 
open to exploration. 
  Two of the new oil fields, Abda'u said, were on-shore fields 
in Bengara and Kisaran, East Kalimantan. 
  Two others, he went on, were off-shore/on-shore fields, 
namely one in Muna, South-East Sulawesi and the other in 
Pagatan, South Kalimantan. 
  The remaining eight oil fields, he added, were off-shore 
fields, namely Java Sea I, off-shore Lampung and Pangkah in the 
Java Sea, Asahan in North Sumatera, Sebawang in East Kalimantan, 
Wowoni in South-East Sulawesi and Tamuloi as well as Sebakor, 
both in Irian Jaya. 
  In the meantime, G.A.S. Nayoan, Pertamina's director of 
exploration and production, said that as the new PSC exploration 
fields were outside the areas included in 1993 oil/gas incentive 
package scheme Pertamina had recently introduced, the split 
effected would not change. 
  In addition, he said, Pertamina was also offering to 
investors 28 old oil wells under the technical assistance 
contract (TAC) scheme, whereby old oil wells already given up by 
old contractors would be reactivated through a process known as 
enhanced oil recovery (EOR) so that the remaining oil deposits 
could be tapped. 
  He also disclosed that 1:9 oil companies, 50 of them 
national 
private companies, had been put on Pertamina's mailing list for 
1994 oil exploration activities, under either a PSC or EOR basis. 
  On the occasion, Nayoan also said that the policy of opening 
up new oil fields was, in fact, related to efforts to intensify 
exploration and drilling activities because in 1993 only 111 out 
of the targeted 207 oil wells had been drilled. 
  He said that the failure in reaching the drilling target was 
attributable to stiffer competition to attract oil investors, 
declining profits owing to a drop in the oil price and 
preference on the part of oil/gas industry to invest in the 
downstream industry rather than in the upstream industry because 
of much-discussed environmental matters. 
  "As we are greatly concerned about this fact, our policy in 
exploration and production in 1994 is focused on intensifying 
drilling activities," He explained, adding that in this context 
the government's recent incentive package to be applied to 
Indonesia's eastern regions and other frontier areas in the 
country's western regions was expected to spur exploration and 
drilling activities.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 19 (KCNA) -- Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, a 
patriotic champion of reunification who had been active in South 
Korea for a long time for the reunification of the country and 
the democratization of the society, died, to our regret, on 
January 18 at the age of 76. 
  He devotedly struggled in South Korea for independence and 
democratization of the society and for the reunification of the 
country. 
  He, who started the activities for democracy in 1974 as a 
member of the Council of Literary Men for the Practice of 
Freedom, worked out the "March 1 Declaration for Democracy and 
National Salvation" against the "Yusin" fascist dictatorship in 
1976. And in 1979, he, active as the chairman of the Central 
Standing Committee of the National Alliance for Democracy and 
Reunification, continued the struggle on the street and behind 
bars, opposing the seizure of power by the "fifth republic" 
military fascist clique and denouncing the barbarities of the 
United States in the Kwangju popular uprising. 
  He was arrested and imprisoned more than once because he 
urged the U.S. troops pullout, the obstacle to the country's 
reunification, and called for the establishment of a democratic 
government, the conclusion of a peace agreement, reunification 
through confederacy, etc. 
  He was active as the chairman of the National Congress for 
Democracy and Unification, the co-chairman of the National 
Liaison Organization for Democracy, the chairman of the United 
People's Movement for Democracy and Unification (Mintongnyon) 
and advisor to the Coalition for National Democratic Movement 
(Chonminnyon) in the period from 1984 to 1989. 
  He participated in the "World Conference for Peace and 
Reunification of the Korean Peninsula" in 1988 and called for 
the replacement of the armistice agreement with a peace 
agreement and the denuclearization of the peninsula. 
  He supported the proposal advanced by the great leader 
President Kim Il-song in his New Year address for 1989 for the 
convocation of a North-South political consultative meeting to 
discuss the way of reunifying the country through confederacy. 
And he visited Pyongyang at the risk of his life in late March 
that year. 
  While in Pyongyang, he was received by the great leader 
President Kim Il-song, the sun of the nation and the lodestar of 
national reunification, and renewed his strong faith and will 
for reunification. 
  As the advisor to Chonminnyon, he held talks with officials 
of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the 
Fatherland, agreed to the removal of the political and military 
confrontation between the North and the South, the replacement 
of the armistice agreement between the DPRK and the United 
States with a peace agreement, the adoption of a nonaggression 
declaration between the North and the South, reunification 
through confederacy, etc. and published a joint statement. 
  Back to South Korea, he was arrested and jailed by the 
fascists. But he continued the struggle for independence, 
democracy and reunification. Working as the chairman of the 
preparatory committee for the inauguration of the South side 
headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's 
Reunification (Pomminnyon) from 1991, he made strenuous efforts 
for national unity and peaceful reunification. 
  Though the old man had become weak because of many years' 
imprisonment, he admirably fought to the last moment of his life 
for the patriotic cause of reunification. 
  Although Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, who fought for independence and 
democratization of the South Korean society and for peaceful 
reunification of the country, passed away, his desire will be 
surely realised by the South Korean people and students and his 
patriotic spirit for reunification will always remain in the 
memory of the Koreans at home and abroad.

<F P=106> ["Decision To Send Mourners' Group to Seoul on Death of Rev. </F>
Mun Ik-hwan Notified to South Side" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 20 (KCNA) -- The North side 
headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's 
Reunification (Pomminnyon) today notified the South side that it 
decided to send a mourners' group to Seoul on the death of the 
Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, a pro-reunification patriot. 
  This was disclosed in a telephone message sent today by Paek 
In-chun, chairman of the North side headquarters of Pomminnyon, 
to Yi Yong-tok, "minister of the Unification Board" of South 
Korea. 
  The message said: 
  The late Rev. Mun Ik-hwan enjoyed the love and respect of 
the 
nation as a reputed pro-reunification patriot for his many 
years' patriotic activities for the democratisation of society 
and the reunification of the country against the interference of 
outside forces. 
  Particularly, he visited Pyongyang at the risk of his life 
in 
1989 and was received by respected President Kim Il-song, and 
went back after discussing the reunification question of the 
country with the North sides officials concerned with 
reunification, thus not only instilling the conviction of 
national reunification into the South Korean people but leaving 
unforgettable impressions to the people in the northern half of 
Korea. 
  It was to be regretted that when the Rev. Mun Ik-hwan was 
put 
under illegal detention after his visit to Pyongyang, we could 
not pay a consolatory visit to him owing to the obstructive 
moves of the military authorities of your side. 
  Love and sympathy of our people for him are getting stronger 
today when he passed away without seeing the day of 
reunification for which he longed so ardently in his lifetime. 
  We inform you that we decided to send a mourners' group to 
Seoul in order to convey the most profound sorrow of our people 
for the deceased. 
  I propose to have a contact between working officials of 
both 
sides at the conference room of the Neutral Nations Supervisory 
Commission at Panmunjom at 10:00 on January 21 (Friday) to 
discuss practical matters concerning the visit of our group to 
Seoul. 
  I express the hope that your side will take a corresponding 
measure as our side plans to send two liaison officials of the 
North-South liaison office.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 21 (KCNA) -- Paek In-chun, 
chairman of the North side headquarters of the National Alliance 
for the Country's Reunification, in his telephone message to the 
"minister of the unification board" of South Korea Thursday 
notified him that we were going to send a mourners' group to 
Seoul with a view to cherishing the memory of the Rev. Mun 
Ik-hwan, a patriotic champion for reunification, on his sudden 
death and sharing pains with the South Korean people, and 
proposed to have a contact between working officials of both 
sides at the conference room of the Neutral Nations Supervisory 
Commission at Panmunjom at 10:00 AM on January 21 to discuss 
working matters concerning it. 
  But the contact between the working officials of both sides 
failed to be held today owing to the unjustifiable attitude of 
the South side. 
  The South Korean authorities did not come out to contact 
without a reply telephone message, avoiding our compatriotic and 
courtesy proposal for a consolatory visit under an inhuman, 
illegal, unjust and unreasonable pretext contrary to common 
sense. 
  The North side representatives in Panmunjom of the 
North-South liaison office informed the South side of our stand 
concerning the contact at 09;00 this morning by telephone and 
urged it to come out to the contact but it evaded the contact, 
not saying a word. 
  The working officials of the North side failed to discuss 
the 
Seoul visit of our mourners' group with the South side and, 
accordingly, the group failed to go to Seoul and mourn the late 
Rev Mun Ik-hwan on January 22 [as received], the funeral day, as 
scheduled. 
  The behaviour of the South Korean authorities who refused to 
accept the North side mourner's group this time showed that they 
are not human beings, far from being the same nation, and they 
have neither ancestral manners and customs nor courtesy and 
morality.

of Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, who devotedly struggled for independence, 
democracy and reunification.

would always remain in the memory of the Koreans in the North 
and the South struggling together for reunification in the `90s. 
  The C.C., DFRF expressed the belief that the South Korean

for reunification and democracy into the will for reunification

they would meet each other again after the reunification of the 
country, he expressed the hope that the desire for reunification 
cherished by Rev. Mun in his lifetime would be realised.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Smear Campaign Seeking </F>
Insidious Purpose"] 
  [Text] Lately a new smear anticommunist campaign against 
our Republic is being viciously carried out in South Korea and 
Japan. 
  According to a report, the South Korean puppets, on the 
premise that a missing military secret document might be handed 
over to the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan 
[Chongnyon] through South Korean students studying in Japan, 
launched an investigation. 
  Timed to coincide with this, the Japanese reactionaries 
loudly talk about the export of a spectrum analyzer that can be 
converted to military use, including upgrading the precision of 
hitting targets and the possibility of using it in our missiles. 
They also spread a rumor through the media that the Japanese 
Police Department suspects that a Kanagawa Prefecture-based 
trading company, specializing in deals between Tokyo and 
Pyongyang, exported the spectrum analyzer. 
  This is another premeditated and intentional fabrication of 
the South Korean puppets and Japanese reactionaries, who are 
experts in smear campaigns and who say black is white and report 
what is not existent as existent. 
  Claiming that a military secret document that was sent to a 
national assemblyman of the United People's Party disappeared, 
the puppets launched an investigation of relevant figures. 
During a press interview, however, this assemblyman said that he 
did not know that such a document was sent from the Ministry of 
National Defense [MND] nor was he aware of a request to return 
the document. He noted that when the Defense Security Command 
requested his signature on the document of conclusion of 
investigation, he refused to sign because there was no reason 
for this. He added that the MND's hasty announcement of the 
incident is suspicious. 
  Assuming that the lost document might be handed over to 
Chongnyon, the puppets preposterously attempted to link this 
with us. This fact alone shows how foolish and ugly this smear 
campaign is. 
  That the Japanese reactionaries slandered us and Chongnyon 
by 
talking about the export of a spectrum analyzer and a 
possibility of its use is indeed ridiculous. 
  The fact illustrates that the South Korean puppets and 
Japanese reactionaries, just as they frantically ran amok with 
anti-Republic commotions on the pretext of our fictitious 
so-called nuclear problem, conspired the current smear campaign 
in collusion. 
  Then, why did the South Korean puppets and Japanese 
reactionaries spread a new rumor on suspicion, which can 
convince no one, by slandering us and Chongnyonm who have 
nothing to do with this? 
  As is known to all, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique and 
Japanese reactionaries have persistently maneuvered to block the 
progress in the DPRK-U.S. talks by spreading a rumor on 
suspicion of our fictitious nuclear weapons development. On the 
pretext of suspicion of our nuclear development, they also 
pursue an aim to accelerate their own nuclear armament. 
  Our peaceful nuclear policy has been proven to be innocent 
as 
time passes, while the criminal nature of their anticommunist 
smear campaign has been more clearly revealed. In particular, 
in the DPRK-U.S. contact held in New York at the end of 1993, 
the two sides agreed to hold the third round of talks and to 
settle in a package [ilgwal tagyol] the issues for essential 
solution of the nuclear issue. As a result, a breakthrough was 
opened for progress in the talks that were deadlocked. 
  Embarrassed by this, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique and 
Japanese reactionaries are attempting to block the third round 
of DPRK-U.S. talks at any cost by bringing forward a nuclear and 
missile threat and by fabricating a rumor on a new suspicion. 
  In addition, they are pursuing a sinister purpose of 
alienating Chongnyon from us and of working out a new pretext 
for repression of Chongnyon. 
  Such a foolish fabrication drama cannot convince anyone. 
Rather, this will only reveal their ugly nature more clearly. 
The rascals can gain nothing from an anti-Republic smear 
campaign. 
  The South Korean puppets and Japanese reactionaries should 
abandon sinister aims and immediately stop this anti-Republic 
smear campaign.

  [Text] Tokyo, January 18 [dateline as received] (KNS-KCNA) 
-- Paek Han-ki, vice-chairman of the Central Standing Committee 
of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, in a 
statement today bitterly denounced the anti-DPRK smear campaign 
of the Japanese authorities and urged them to stop the hostile 
acts at once. 
  The Japanese authorities recently launched a probe into a 
trading firm of Japan "suspected of violating the regulations of 
the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls 
(Cocom)" and are conducting a despicable anti-DPRK campaign, 
connecting the case with the innocent DPRK in a far-fetched way. 
  The vice-chairman branded this as an utterly groundless 
fabrication to impair the dignity and prestige of the DPRK and 
another shameless political intrigue, which shows the true 
colour of the Japanese authorities who resort to hostile 
propaganda, reversing black and white. 
  He said: 
  "At a time when the DPRK and the United States are moving 
toward a package solution of the problems for a fundamental 
settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula thanks 
to the self-determined and aboveboard diplomatic policy of the 
DPRK, the Japanese authorities have launched a new smear 
campaign against the DPRK. This is an unpardonable challenge to 
throw a wet blanket over the progress of the DPRK-U.S. talks and 
isolate and blockade the DPRK. This is also an anachronistic 
act against the world public that wish the solution of the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and the improvement of the 
DPRK-U.S. relations through dialogue and negotiation. 
  "With no pressure and plot can the international 
reactionaries and the Japanese authorities undermine the 
international prestige of the DPRK or block the advance of the 
Korean people. 
  "The Japanese authorities must look straight at the trend of 
the times and immediately stop the smear campaign and hostile 
acts against the DPRK."

  [Text] The South Korean puppets today brought a 
large-caliber gun into the DMZ in the western front line, thus 
committing a grave military provocation. 
  At around 0920 today, the South Korean puppets illegally 
brought and installed a 105-mm large-caliber gun 1,800- meters 
east of the Military Demarcation Line [MDL] Marker 0038 in front 
of Tongchang-ri, Panmun County, Kaesong City, from the direction 
of Paengnyong-ri, Paju County. They assumed the firing position 
toward our side and gravely irritated us. 
  That the South Korean puppets openly brought a large-caliber 
gun into the DMZ in broad daylight is a preplanned provocation 
maneuver designed to artificially aggravate the situation in 
this area where armed forces of the two sides are being deployed 
acutely. 
  Since such military provocation is perpetrated at a time 
when 
the U.S. imperialists and bellicose elements in the puppet 
military recently made frequent visits to the areas in the 
foremost frontline and instigated the frenzy for northward 
invasion, we cannot overlook this provocation. 
  The South Korean puppets should correctly ponder the grave 
consequences to result from arms buildup maneuvers in the DMZ. 
They should not act rashly.
