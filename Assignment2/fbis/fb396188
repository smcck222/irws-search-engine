  [Text] Pyongyang, January 15 (KCNA) -- The North side 
headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's 
Reunification (Pomminnyon) declared it would positively 
contribute to the achievement of great national unity and the 
noble cause of the country's reunification, keeping pace with 
the patriotic movement of Koreans in the South and overseas for 
great national unity. 
  In a statement released today, the Central Committee of the 
North side headquarters of Pomminnyon highly estimates and fully 
supports a proposal and call of the overseas Koreans' 
headquarters of Pomminnyon for setting this as a "year of great 
national unity" for national reunification. 
  Noting that the proposal and call are very just and timely 
both in view of the nature of the national reunification 
question and the desire of the fellow countrymen for great 
national unity and they will help convincingly promote the 
reunification in the `90s, the statement says: 
  "The North side headquarters, in hearty response to the 
proposal of the overseas Koreans' headquarters, will vigorously 
struggle shoulder to shoulder with Koreans overseas to achieve 
great unity of the nation this year. 
  "Regarding the Kim Yong-sam group as the foe of great 
national unity, it will staunchly struggle against it and, in 
this way, actively promote great national unity with Koreans in 
the South and overseas. 
  "We hold that anybody must refrain from rejecting 
Pomminnyon, 
a pan-national umbrella organization for great national unity 
and the reunification of the country, and join in the patriotic 
movement for reunification."

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 20 (KCNA) -- The reclamation of 
tideland is briskly going on in Korea, expanding the area under 
cultivation. 
  Some time ago, the final damming of the tideland of Chongsu 
island in South Hwanghae Province was completed to bring 1,000 
hectares of tideland under cultivation. Last year saw the 
reclamation of 3,300 hectares of Kumsong tideland. 
  The three farms which made their appearance in the Kwaksan 
tideland in North Pyongan Province reaped a rich crop in their 
first year's farming. These tideland-turned fields have a 
favourable condition for comprehensive mechanisation of paddy 
farming. Their irrigation networks are also flawless. 
  Korea, which has a limited arable land with mountains 
occupying the greater part of its area, has directed big efforts 
to tideland reclamation, steadily increasing the investment in 
it. 
  Tideland reclamation has been pushed ahead in various areas 
on the west coast. As a result, a hundred and scores of islets 
have been linked with the land, the length of the coastline has 
been drastically shortened and over 80 fishing ports have moved 
to the skirts of the outstretched land. 
  A number of farms have appeared in the tideland-turned 
fields. Modern socialist villages with fashionable residential 
houses have cropped up in the former tideland of Yomju county 
and Tasa island in North Pyongan Province. Tideland farms with 
a thousand and several hundred hectares of arable land each have 
come into being in Onchon, Chungsan, Pyongwon, Sukchon and other 
areas of South Pyongan Province. South Hwanghae Province has 
several tideland farms. 
  The fields of the Yangji and Namhae cooperative farms 
situated in the vast tideland-turned field of Unchon county have 
been arranged for mechanized farming. 
  Last year, the June 3 and Ansok cooperative farms in Onchon 
county and many other farms in former tideland reaped more than 
8 tons of grain from each hectare.

<F P=106> ["Imperialism Near Its Doom" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 15 (KCNA) -- The imperialists are 
bluffing, holding forth about the "end of socialism," but it is 
none other than imperialism that is approaching its doom, says 
NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined article today. The article says: 
This is well illustrated by the serious crisis the 
imperialists now are undergoing. 
  Above all, socio-class antagonisms have grown worse in the 
imperialist countries because of the reactionary and corrupt 
nature of the capitalist system. 
  The capitalist political system is a political system and 
order which was framed up by a handful of the capitalist class 
to oppress and exploit the popular masses who account for an 
overwhelming majority of the population. Hence, the class 
antagonisms between the reactionary ruling class and the popular 
masses are increasing day by day. 
  In 1992 alone violent protests of dissatisfied workers 
against the reactionary policy of the government took place in 
the United States on 111,000 occasions. This graphically shows 
to what extent the socio-class antagonisms have gone in 
imperialist countries. 
  With the money-is-everything tendency fully reflected in 
politics, plutocracy is holding sway in capitalist society. In 
Japan, the cabinet had to resign and the Diet was dissolved 
before the expiry of its term repeatedly due to bribery cases 
involving political circles including the "Lockheed scandal". 
  Economic crisis is deteriorating in imperialist countries. 
  The annual federal financial deficits of the United States 
are more or less 300 billion dollars and the state debts far 
exceed 4,000 billion dollars. 
  The economy in Britain, Japan, Germany, France and other 
countries is also floundering like a ship in distress. Japan is 
now in the grip of worst depression since World War II, which 
gives a glimpse of the society of this country seized with 
uncontrollable uncertainty for the future. 
  The serious crisis of the imperialists is also manifested in 
all cases of corruption and social vices rife in these countries. 
  The United States called the "drug kingdom" has more than 30 
million addicts. 
  Violent criminal cases like murder and robbery are getting 
more uncontrollable in the imperialist countries. 
  The imperialists, with false propaganda about the "end of 
socialism," are trying to divert elsewhere the public attention 
from the serious crisis of destruction they are now undergoing, 
cause ideological vacillation among the revolutionary people of 
the world who aspire after independence, progress and socialism 
and to break their faith in socialism so as to stem the tide of 
history. But this is a foolish dream.

<F P=106> ["Unattributed "talk": "The Militant Slogan Our People </F>
Should Uphold This Year"] 
  [Text] Our people throughout the country are now 
overflowing with hope and conviction to conduct new struggles by 
upholding the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year 
address. In his New Year address, the great leader presented 
the militant slogan our people should uphold. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: We must 
effect a new upturn in socialist construction by overcoming 
difficulties and by displaying the revolutionary spirit of 
self-reliance and fortitude more highly. 
  With the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and 
fortitude, 
let us vigorously accelerate the grand socialist march. This is 
the call of our party, as well as the militant slogan our people 
must uphold today. 
  Self-reliance and fortitude mean a resolute revolutionary 
position to carry out endlessly the revolution and construction 
by our own might, as well as an indomitable spirit of struggle 
to adhere to the revolutionary banner in defiance of any 
difficulties and obstacles. 
  The display of the dignity and honor of the country and 
nation depends on self-reliance and fortitude. Even the way to 
build the most consolidated and vital socialism depends on 
self-reliance and fortitude. 
  With the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and 
fortitude, 
let us vigorously accelerate the grand socialist march. This 
slogan is the militant one that our people must uphold today 
because we can overcome various challenges and obstructive 
maneuvers by the imperialists and reactionaries and resolutely 
safeguard and adhere to socialism of our own style only if we 
uphold it. 
  As soon as socialism collapsed in various countries 
throughout the world, the imperialists and reactionaries 
strengthened their unprecedented offensives in all fields -- 
political, economic, military, and diplomatic -- to isolate, 
suffocate [chilsik], and crush [apsal] our Republic, which is 
advancing under the socialist banner. 
  Because of the enemies' anti-Republic and antisocialist 
maneuvers, the situation in our country have been aggravated and 
complicated. Also, a great number of obstacles have been 
created on the road ahead of us. 
  For all people to accelerate on the grand socialist march 
with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude 
will be a firm guarantee in smashing challenges by the 
imperialists and reactionaries and in resolutely safeguarding 
and adhering to socialism of our own style. 
  Socialism of our own style is the chuche socialism built by 
our people's own might under the wise leadership of the party 
and the leader [suryong]. This means that we must solve all 
problems in the socialist construction by our own might and from 
the chuche stance in any difficult conditions. 
  The people, who highly display the revolutionary spirit of 
self-reliance and fortitude, can keep their dignity and honor 
under any adversity, but the people, who fail to display it, 
will easily give in to the difficulties and trials and be doomed 
to ruin. 
  Even last year, the imperialists and reactionaries applied 
pressure on various fields to crush [apsal] our Republic. 
  We accelerated the socialist general march, however, by 
highly displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and 
arduous struggle and by rising as one with firm determination, 
not yielding to any maneuver, under the wise leadership of the 
party and the leader. Thus, we defended the supreme interest of 
the nation and people and safeguarded and protected our-style 
socialism. 
  Experience shows that when we vigorously carry out the 
socialist general march by displaying the revolutionary spirit 
of self-reliance and arduous struggle, we can resolutely crush 
various challenges and disturbance maneuvers of the imperialists 
and reactionaries, can staunchly defend and protect our-style 
socialism, and can firmly safeguard dignity and honor of the 
nation. 
  "Let us vigorously accelerate the socialist general march 
with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous 
struggle" -- this is a militant slogan that our people should 
uphold. Only when we uphold this slogan, can we thoroughly 
implement our party's revolutionary economic strategy and 
further glorify our-style socialism. 
  In his New Year address, the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song 
put forward as a strategic task the implementation of 
agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first policy 
during the three-year adjustment period by giving priority to 
the coal industry, the electricity industry, and railway 
transport -- the precedence domains in the national economy -- 
and continuous development of the metal industry. 
  We will thoroughly implement our party's revolutionary 
economic strategy during the adjustment period of socialist 
economic construction, and thus will firmly consolidate the 
foundation of the nation's self-supporting economy. We will more 
satisfactorily ensure the people's living standard in compliance 
with the demand of socialism and will hold a new offensive 
position to occupy the greater height of socialism. 
  Displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and 
arduous struggle by our people is an important demand for 
implementing the party's revolutionary economic strategy. 
  This year we should continuously adhere to the 
agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first policy. 
This year, which marks the 30th anniversary of publication of 
the rural thesis, we should vigorously carry out the struggle to 
accomplish the historic task of the rural thesis and should 
effect a new turn in the development of rural economy. Thus, we 
should attain without fail the lofty target of grain production 
put forward by the party. 
  At the same time, by vigorously accelerating the light 
industry revolution, we should effect great innovations in the 
production of consumer goods and should develop external trade 
in compliance with changing circumstances. 
  For us to develop agriculture and light industry and to 
vigorously accelerate the nation's overall economic 
construction, we should direct our strength to the coal, 
electricity, and metal industry, and should more satisfactorily 
establish railway transport. 
  The tasks for implementing the party's revolutionary 
economic 
strategy are indeed gigantic. The road for successfully carrying 
out these grave tasks is to more highly display the 
revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle. 
  Only when we wage the struggle to carry out our party's 
revolutionary economic strategy based on the revolutionary 
position to rely on our own strength, technology, and natural 
resources, can we successfully accelerate socialist 
construction. This proves that when we advance by highly 
upholding the slogan on accelerating the socialist general march 
with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous 
struggle, we can further glorify our-style socialism by 
thoroughly implementing our party's revolutionary economic 
strategy. 
  What is important in effecting a new revolutionary upsurge 
in 
socialist construction under the revolutionary banner of 
self-reliance is for all party members and working people to 
fight staunchly with the spirit of adding the speed of the 
nineties to Chollima. 
  All party members and workers should advance and advance 
again and should struggle and struggle again with the tenacious 
Chollima spirit cherished by the working class in Kangson, which 
produced 120,000 tons of steel billet from the blooming mill 
with only a 60,000-ton capacity when everything was short and 
difficult, and with the militant spirit with which they 
manufactured modern machinery with their own strength through 
arduous struggle. 
  For all people to vigorously accelerate the socialist 
general 
march with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous 
struggle, we should, above all, have firm resolution and 
determination to safeguard to the last and glorify the socialist 
banner with our own strength by trusting this strength. 
  Our people will not abandon our independent position even if 
someone else applies pressure on us, nor will we rely on others 
in the face of difficulty. 
  Our people's will to nurture the socialist ideal on this 
land 
with our own strength, wisdom, and natural resources will not 
change today and in the future. All party members and working 
people should more firmly assume the thoroughgoing position to 
carry to accomplishment the chuche socialist cause to the end 
with our own strength, and should vigorously accelerate the 
socialist general march with the revolutionary spirit of 
self-reliance and arduous struggle.

  [Text] The government peace panel is willing to negotiate 
with the "revisionist faction" of the National Democratic Front 
if its talks with Netherlands-based NDF [National Democratic 
Front] leadership collapse, Ambassador Howard Dee, head of the 
panel, said yesterday. 
  Dee said the government peace panel is considering "other 
options" if the talks with NDF Jose Maria Sison and Luis 
Jalandoni failed. 
  "If the exploratory talks will not take place in the first 
quarter, we have to consider other options like opening up to 
the revisionist faction in the communist movement," Dee said. 
  Dee made the statement two days after the Alex Boncayao 
Brigade (ABB) released the names of some 345 persons marked for 
liquidation for their alleged involvement in various crimes. 
  He said the threatened new wave of assassination by the ABB 
hit squad will not affect the peace negotiations between the 
government and the NDF. 
  Dee said the ABB's threat to liquidate corrupt officials in 
the government, including police and military officials, will 
not directly affect the stalled talks with the NDF. He noted 
that the hit squad had already broken off from the mainstream 
communist movement.

  [By Chit Estella] 
  [Excerpts] Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon yesterday urged 
the government to start considering the possibility of opening 
talks with rebel groups opposed to Jose Ma. Sison. 
  Drilon made this suggestion amid the continued failure of 
the 
government and the National Democratic Front [NDF] panels to 
make any headway in the peace efforts. 
  "The government has bent over backwards for too long," he 
said. [passage omitted] 
  Drilon said the NDF, or the group identified with Sison, be 
given until the end of January to conduct exploratory talks with 
the government. After that, the government should start talking 
with locally-based rebels opposed to Sison, he said. 
  Drilon said it does not matter if the anti-Sison faction 
does 
not completely control the New People's Army [NPA]. Making 
peace with one faction is better than having no agreement with 
anyone at all, he said. 
  "We should prepare to talk with at least a faction," he 
said. 
[passage omitted] 
  Drilon, who was a member of the National Unification 
Commission, recalled that when the agency was still existing, it 
received word that local rebels opposed to Sison wanted to have 
separate representation. 
  "We got very clear signals that it is alright for the 
government to hold exploratory talks with Sison et al, but when 
it comes to formal negotiations, they would want to be 
represented," the justice secretary said. 
  He added that even some members of the CPP hierarchy want to 
conduct talks with the government. "There was a report that a 
certain point, certain NDF leaders in the Philippines were 
disappointed because of the perception that we are talking only 
with Joma [Jose Ma. Sison]," he said. [sentence as published] 
  The government is currently communicating officially with 
NDF 
Vice Chairman Luis Jalandoni who heads the NDF panel.

  [Excerpts] The chief government peace negotiator with the 
local communist movement said yesterday the communist New 
People's Army's (NPA) Alex Boncayao Brigade's (ABB) threat to 
resume terrorist operations in the country will not derail the 
peace talks. 
  Howard Dee, former ambassador to the Vatican and chief of 
the 
government panel holding preliminary talks with the National 
Democratic Front (NDF) said the planned peace talks will 
continue despite the ABB threat. 
  The ABB over the weekend threatened to assassinate criminals 
and corrupt government, police and military officers allegedly 
involved or members of crime syndicates. 
  According to Dee, the ABB, which belongs to the CPP 
[Communist Party of the Philippines] breakaway group 
Manila-Rizal Regional Party Committee, had already declared 
autonomy from the Netherlands- based NDF leadership headed by 
Jose Maria Sison. 
  He however hinted that the government is ready to talk with 
the "revisionist faction [breakaway groups]" of the local 
communist movement should the talks with the Sison faction of 
the NDF collapse. 
  The ABB threat "will not affect the peace talks in itself 
but 
it could be a subject that will come out in the course of the 
peace talks," Dee said. [passage omitted] 
  Dee said the exploratory talks in Vietnam, should they push 
through, will only lay the grounds for the formal talks. 
  He said the exploratory talks in Vietnam are expected to 
take 
place within the first quarter of the year while the formal 
talks are expected to last for about three to six months. 
  "If the exploratory talks will not take place in the first 
quarter, we have to consider other options like opening up to 
the revisionist faction in the communist movement," Dee said.

  [Excerpts] President Ramos granted amnesty yesterday to 
1,080 rebel returnees on recommendation of the National 
Reconciliation and Development Council (NRDC) to enable the 
former rebels to rejoin society and lead normal lives. 
  Interior and Local Government Secretary Rafael Alunan III, 
also NRDC chairman, said that the 1,080 rebel returnees were the 
first of 4,000 applicants to be given presidential amnesty. 
[passage omitted] 
  The grant of amnesty to the rebel returnees was made 
pursuant 
to Proclamation 10 and 10A which allow amnesty to those whose 
applications were filed, processed or were undergoing processing 
before 31 December 1992. [passage omitted] 
  In his regular press conference yesterday, Ramos also said 
that concerned agencies have been alerted on the threat of the 
Alex Boncayao Brigade (ABB) to punish some government, police, 
and military officials and persons whom they tagged as involved 
in illegal drugs, illegal gambling, prostitution, and graft and 
corruption. 
  In a press conference last week, a spokesman of the Alex 
Boncayao Brigade released a list of 345 persons, including 
police and military generals and businessmen, whom they accused 
of various criminal and immoral activities and were asked to 
"reform." [passage omitted] 
  "We alerted the PNP [Philippine National Police], DILG 
[Department of Interior and Local Government], and the DOJ 
[Department of Justice] to look into this," Ramos said. 
  Ramos added that the threats may have "some intended 
propaganda effects but just the same, we are looking at it very 
seriously." 
  At the same time, the president said that the government 
will 
continue to run after criminal elements in the country. [passage 
omitted]

  [Excerpts] Cashiered Army Col. Gregorio "Gringo" Honasan, 
leader of the Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa (RAM) 
[Revolutionary Nationalist Alliance] said yesterday his group 
was "getting discouraged and losing confidence" with the way 
government peace negotiators are handling the peace talks with 
military rebels. 
  He stressed, however, that RAM would not abandon its hope to 
reach a peace accord with the government, and that they will 
wait for another six months for the government to act concretely 
on the issue. [passage omitted] 
  "We are beginning to be discouraged but we are not 
discarding 
the peace process. Even if they don't know what to do with the 
peace process, we are not going to give up," Honasan said. 
  "Mukhang wala na namang plano ang pamahalaan ... mukhang 
nagbobolahan na naman. Gusto naming malaman kung ano talaga ang 
gusto nilang mangyari sa peace process," [It seems that the 
government has no plans ... looks like it is back to deception. 
We want to know what they really want to happen with the peace 
process] he added. [passage omitted] 
  "One year na kaming nag-uusap ... pero ang narating lang 
namin procedures ... saan gagawin ... sino ang magho-host ng 
merienda. Tapos, napapagbintangan kami na kami pa raw ang 
nagpapabagal pero lahat naiprisinta na namin," [We have been 
talking for one year ... but what we have achieved are only 
procedures ... where to hold ... who will take charge of the 
snacks. Afterwhich, we are blamed for delaying the talks when 
we have already presented everything] he explained. 
  He said they have already given five talking points with the 
government but it remained enacted upon. [sentence as published] 
His request for provision of bodyguards for protection, was 
approved in principle by President Ramos but this also remained 
unheeded. 
  "MNLF [Moro National Liberation Front] Chairman Nur Misuari 
moves around in Mindanao with many armed bodyguards. Pero kami 
na nangunguna, kami pa ang hindi bigyan ng ganuong 
konsiderasyon," [But we who talked peace with the government 
ahead of the MNLF are not given such consideration] Honasan said. 
  Asked by the STANDARD if they have a time frame within which 
they would seek other options concerning the peace talks, 
Honasan said: "Siguro ibig naming tingnan 'yung kalagitnaan ng 
taong ito para mabasa natin kung babagal ito at kung may 
pinanggagalingan ang katapatan nila." [I think we will just 
watch at the middle of this year to determine if the peace 
process slows down and if they are really sincere.] 
  What options they would make in case the peace talks fail? 
He said: Kung hihinto? Hindi ... ayaw naming isipin 'yon. 
Kapag huminto ito ay mas grabe ang mangyayari." [If it stops? 
No ... we do not want to think about it. If this stops, the 
worse will happen.] 
  RAM-YOU (Young Officers Union) leader Capt. Emil Ong said 
there are many issues that have to be discussed in the peace 
talks that are being ignored. 
  Ong, who was with Honasan at UST, declined to give the exact 
number of RAM forces at present but said only 20 percent of the 
entire RAM forces had been mobilized during the December 1989 
coup attempt. 
  Honasan laments the fact that some of his men are still in 
jail despite a preliminary agreement reached last 20 December 
1992 that all detained RAM men will be released from detention.

  [Text] Multilateral cooperation among members of the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) claiming the 
Spratly Islands is needed in solving the dispute over the 
oil-rich islands as part of confidence-building measures in 
Asia, an association of nongovernment organizations within ASEAN 
said yesterday. 
  In a press conference, the ASEAN-Institute of Strategic and 
International Studies [ASEAN-ISIS], noted the importance of the 
role of China, a non-ASEAN member which, together with Taiwan, 
Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines, is claiming 
wholly or in part the Spratlys in the South China Sea. 
  The claimant-countries agreed in July 1992 to restrain from 
the use of arms in the disputed territories. 
  The ASEAN-ISIS said it will recommend this to the ASEAN 
regional forum in Bangkok this July. 
  The forum may also be participated in by the United States, 
Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and the 
European Union. 
  Jusuf Wanandi, chairman of Indonesia's Center for Strategic 
and International Studies, said the ASEAN-ISIS had in the past 
advised countries concerned against arms buildup in order not to 
create misunderstanding and misgivings among themselves. 
  "For that reason we now propose that our security 
cooperation 
should be increased among ASEAN," Wanandi said noting that 
confidence-building must stem from existing bilateral and 
multilateral agreements. 
  Wanandi said ASEAN must not be alarmed over China's reported 
arms buildup, and instead get it to engage more in 
tension-reducing and confidence-building measures. 
  He said in the overlapping claims on Spratlys, China's role 
is very important. "We have to get her more engaged in other 
types of approaches to find the solution because she is central 
to the issue, as you all know." 
  Kusuma Snitwongse, director of Thailand's Institute of 
Security and International Studies, also said Southeast Asia 
must engage China in a "cooperative manner" since it is no match 
to China. 
  The ASEAN-ISIS, on its second day of a four-day conference 
at 
the Edsa Shangri-La Hotel said ASEAN forums should encourage 
China to have a stake in the continued prosperity of the area 
following reports that China is no longer interested in a 
peaceful settlement of Spratlys disputes. 
  Carolina Hernandez, president of the Institute for Strategic 
and Development Studies at the University of the Philippines, 
said China must not be directly confronted regarding the 
Spratlys issue. 
  "China is very interested in the stability of the region and 
is willing to undertake tension-reducing and confidence-building 
measures," Hernandez said.

<F P=106> [By Olaf S. Giron] </F>
  [Text] Sen. Blas Ople, chairman of the Senate foreign 
relations committee, urged the Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations (ASEAN) yesterday to anticipate potential vacuums in the 
region and forge a new solidarity in defense cooperation. 
  Ople discussed the major strategic challenges in both 
foreign 
policy and security fields that ASEAN has to face at the 
threshold of a new century when he keynoted a two-day symposium 
of the region's leading centers of strategic and international 
studies, the ASEAN Institute of Strategic and International 
Studies (ISIS) at the Shangri-La EDSA Hotel in Mandaluyong. 
  Dean Carolina Hernandez, director of the Center of Strategic 
and International Studies (CSIS), led the meeting, which brought 
together an intellectual powerhouse from ASEAN countries, 
including Lau Teik Soon, director of the Singapore Institute for 
International Affairs; Yusuf Wanandi and Dr. Hadi Soesastro of 
the CSIS in Jakarta; Dr. Kusuma Snitwongse, of the Thailand 
Institute of Security and International Studies; and, Dato Dr. 
Noordin Sopiee, of the ISIS in Kuala Lumpur. 
  At the close of the meeting, the chairmanship of the 
ASEAN-ISIS passed on from the Philippines' Hernandez to Dr. Lau 
of Singapore. 
  Ople said that while ASEAN welcomes the appearance of a new 
tranquility brought about by the end of the Cold War in Asia and 
the Pacific, there is no room for complacency because dangerous 
new vacuums can immediately arise without prior notice and 
confront the ASEAN with major threats to its security. 
  "Our six nations ought to be able to envision new conceptual 
frameworks and a common strategic vision for our collective 
security," Ople said. "The formation of the ASEAN Regional 
Forum is an important first step taken by the leaders of ASEAN 
in that direction." 
  Ople said Japan and China, although they have opened their 
own bilateral security dialogues, will contest any vacuum that 
arises in the region or exploit any change or shift in the 
regional and global balance of power. 
  He said that in spite of the assurances by the United States 
that its commitment to the security of Asia and the Pacific 
remained undiminished, "there is a sense in which the defense 
retrenchments of the United States, involving a reduction of its 
military spending from six percent down to three and a half 
percent of gross national product in the next five years, can no 
longer be reversed." 
  He said while the Pentagon has set a military bottom-line of 
fighting two wars in separate continents at the same time, the 
American people and their leaders now accept the limitations of 
"an imperial overstretch" which saps the resources required for 
domestic economic and social rebuilding. 
  He said that in spite of the tension in the Korean 
peninsula, 
the unsettled conditions in Cambodia, and the potential border 
troubles in the South China Sea, the security environment for 
Southeast Asia has never been better, widening "our respective 
windows of opportunity to engage in sustained economic 
development unhampered by external security threats." 
  Ople said it is a tribute to ASEAN statesmanship that the 
grouping has helped contain the potential disruptions of the 
peace and stability in the South China Sea through creative 
diplomacy.

  [Text] The Philippines' foreign debt stock hit $34.1 
billion as of end-September 1993, up by more than 10 percent 
from $30.9 billion in 1992. 
  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) [Central Bank of the 
Philippines] Governor Gabriel Singson assured, however, that the 
$3.2 billion expansion of government's foreign liabilities 
should cause no alarm because of the improvement in the 
country's "ability to pay." 
  The bigger debt stock was caused by the continued 
appreciation of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar, in 
which the bulk of the country's foreign indebtedness is 
denominated. 
  The debt pile-up was also brought about by the additional 
availments of loans from multilateral creditors. 
  "Some critics are quick to point out that the foreign debt 
has continued to expand. Indeed, it has grown... but the 
country's ability to pay has been more than enhanced," Singson 
told members of the Philippine Association of Finance Companies, 
Inc. 
  To prove his point, Singson cited the country's lower debt 
service ratio or debt service payments as a proportion of 
exports of goods and services as below the 19 percent compared 
to a high of more than 20 percent the previous years. 
  He pointed out this debt service ratio was "well within 
internationally accepted norms" as pointed by the World Bank. 
  In fact, the country's debt service ratio is significantly 
"better" than the ratios of Latin American and the neighboring 
countries such as Argentina at 35 percent, Brazil at 24 percent, 
Indonesia at 32 percent, and Mexico at 44 percent. 
  Also, in his speech, Singson reiterated plans to bring down 
further the level of reserve requirements on bank's deposits and 
deposit liabilities. 
  He pointed out that the "progressive easing of reserve 
requirements augured well for the financial market."

  [Text] Mindanao leaders signed yesterday two resolutions 
in Malacanang to further peace in the region. 
  The first resolution expressed their support for the peace 
talks between the government and the Moro National Liberation 
Front (MNLF); the second recommended the establishment of a 
consultative mechanism between the peace panels and the Mindanao 
community. 
  Present in the meeting held Friday afternoon were Defense 
Secretary Renato de Villa; Interior Secretary Rafael Alunan 
III; Presidential Assistant for Mindanao Paul Dominguez; 
Lieutenant. General Thelmo Cunanan, Southern Command commander; 
Governor Liningding Pangandaman of the Autonomous Region of 
Muslim Mindanao; Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte; and 
Representatives Maria Clara Lobregat (Laban [Party], Zamboanga) 
and Nur Jaafar (Lakas [Party], Tawi-tawi). 
  The meeting assessed the peace and order situation in 
Mindanao in the wake of the bombings perpetrated by radical 
groups, the current peace talks between the government and the 
MNLF, and the progress of the East-Asian Growth Area. 
  President Ramos told the meeting he was determined to reach 
a 
pact with MNLF rebels "in a just and honorable way without 
bloodshed." The president, however, stood pat on the 
government's position disallowing MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari from 
being escorted by 500 armed bodyguards when he entered Cotabato 
City for the signing of the cease fire agreement. 
  The signing of the cease fire agreement scheduled 11 January 
was postponed due to the MNLF's demand to provide Misuari with 
armed escorts.

  [Excerpts] Kroekkrai Chiraphaet, director-general of the 
Department of Business Economics, said the post-Uruguay Round 
liberalization of Thailand's financial sector will be based on 
bilateral negotiations -- not multilateral talks as is generally 
understood. 
  "Anybody who thinks that the negotiations must be conducted 
at the multilateral level is day dreaming," he said. [passage 
omitted] 
  Yet it appeared that Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin 
took 
the stand that Thailand would only use multilateral forums in 
its attempt to reach agreement on the liberalization of 
financial services within the context of the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade. 
  Tharin did tell Bentsen, however during talks at the 
Government House on Tuesday, that Thailand would be considering 
plans to allow foreign banks to operate ATM [automatic teller 
machine] services, to allow foreign firms to own up to 49 per 
cent of securities firms once they had split off their finance 
operations, and to allow offshore banks to expand their presence 
upcountry. 
  Bentsen was apparently happy with the Thai proposal and 
indicated that talks on financial services could be put back on 
track in the GATT forum. [passage omitted] 
  But Kroekkrai said in the post-Uruguay Round it is 
impossible 
to negotiate multilaterally on these issues because that would 
involve talks with 117 countries in varying states of fiscal 
maturity. 
  "Suppose we want to open up financial services talks with 
Laos, we have to bilaterally negotiate with that country. It is 
impossible to agree to anything in broad terms which cannot be 
grasped in concrete terms. Whoever thinks like this is 
daydreaming," he said. 
  MR Chatumongkon Sonakun, director-general of the Revenue 
Department, said following completion of talks on financial 
services, Thailand will have to make drastic adjustments in its 
tax procedures to cope with the complicated business 
transactions of foreign financial institutions. 
  "Offshore banking under the BIBF [Bangkok International 
Banking Facility] has already given us a good headache. The 
Revenue Department will have to improve our system. We have to 
be ready," he said.

  [Excerpts] FOREIGN Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday said 
Thailand would not consider the Burmese ethnic minorities' 
request to use Thailand as a venue for peace talks with the 
Rangoon ruling military junta. 
  "But if the (Burmese) government itself asked for that, we 
will consider it," Prasong told reporters. [passage omitted] 
  Prasong also refused to make a direct comment on a recent 
report that Rangoon might release opposition leader Aung San Suu 
Kyi in July this year. The minister however said that only the 
Burmese government, aware of how the world community views the 
situation in Burma, would know what it should do. [passage 
omitted] 
  The junta's powerful secretary Lt Gen Khin Nyunt said the 
legitimate period of Suu Kyi's house arrest would expire in 
July. Burma's law limits the period of house arrest to a maximum 
of five years. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Louise Fleischer report: "Too Rich for Development Aid"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Bangkok -- The Thais have become too rich to 
receive Danish development aid. Consequently Denmark will 
gradually cease aid. 
  So said Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen (Radical 
Liberal Party) yesterday after a meeting with Thai Foreign 
Minister Prasong Sunsiri in Bangkok. This means that Thailand 
will become the first developing country ever to cease to 
qualify for Danish aid because its economy is too well developed. 
  "But I have stressed that the country can receive other 
forms 
of aid. For example, soft loans and credits for noncommercial 
purposes," Helveg Petersen said. 
  Thailand will also be able to take $25 million from 
Denmark's 
environment and catastrophe fund as compensation for the loss of 
aid. [passage omitted] 
  During the talks the foreign minister also touched on 
Thailand's relations with neighboring Burma. 
  "I stressed that every opportunity must be taken to put 
pressure on the Burmese Government, and that I believe that 
Thailand must continue to grant residence permits to Burmese 
refugees," the foreign minister said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 20 KYODO -- The Japanese Government 
Thursday [20 January] welcomed a U.S. decision to drop 
threatened trade sanctions concerning a bilateral dispute over 
Japan's construction market. 
  Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi said in a statement that 
the U.S. appears to have given high marks to efforts by the 
administration of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to resolve 
the issue, including a recent action program to open Japan's 
construction market to foreign contractors. 
  Following Tuesday's unveiling of the action program to 
overhaul Japan's public works bidding system, the United States 
announced Wednesday it had removed trade sanctions set to go 
into effect Thursday. 
  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata also lauded Washington's move, 
saying in a statement that he is convinced that the settlement 
of the issue will contribute to progress in ongoing bilateral 
framework trade talks.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 20 KYODO -- Japan welcomes the U.S. 
move to lift threatened sanctions against Japan's construction 
market, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said Thursday 
[20 January]. 
  "We hail the quick U.S. reaction" to Japan's action program 
aimed at boosting foreign access to its construction market, the 
top government spokesman told a news conference. 
  He also expressed hope that the outcome of the Japan-U.S. 
construction negotiations will have a favorable effect on the 
"much bigger theme" of bilateral framework trade talks. 
  Following Japan's announcement of the action plan on 
Tuesday, 
U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said Wednesday that the 
United States will remove the threatened punitive actions 
against Japan over the construction market. 
  The U.S. had charged that the Japanese bidding system, which 
allows only a select number of construction firms to tender for 
public works contracts, discriminates against U.S. companies. 
  Washington had set Thursday as the deadline for Tokyo to 
make 
requested changes in bidding procedures, otherwise sanctions 
would be imposed. 
  Takemura said, however, that Japan drew up the action 
program 
of its own volition, not because of U.S. pressure. 
  "I hope this move will have a favorable effect on the 
Japan-U.S. framework talks toward the summit in February," he 
said. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill 
Clinton will meet in Washington on February 11 to assess 
progress in the bilateral negotiations being held under a trade 
framework accord reached last July. 
  The action program, which takes effect April 1, calls for 
the 
introduction of an open bidding system on public works projects 
of central and local governments and 84 public corporations. 
  Currently, only designated contractors are allowed to 
participate in bidding for most projects. 
  Under the action plan, the open bidding system will be 
introduced for state-sponsored projects worth 4.5 million 
special drawing rights (SDRs) or more of the International 
Monetary Fund, or about 720 million yen or more. At present, 
one SDR is valued at 160 yen. 
  Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi said earlier in a 
statement that the U.S. appears to have given high marks to 
efforts by the Hosokawa administration to resolve the issue. 
  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata also said in a statement that 
he is convinced that the settlement of the issue will contribute 
to progress in the framework trade talks.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 20 KYODO -- Japanese nonlife insurers 
on Thursday [20 January] blasted U.S. trade negotiators for 
calling for targets in market access, saying the demands were 
without any "substantial" knowledge of the country's insurance 
market. 
  The criticism came in a statement issued by the Marine and 
Fire Insurance Association of Japan. 
  The association pinpointed "the U.S. side's lopsided demand 
without any substantial knowledge of the Japanese insurance 
market" as the reason for a deadlock in the negotiations -- one 
of the key issues in the bilateral "framework" talks. 
  "Personal field accounts for three-fourths of the premiums 
in 
the fire and marine insurance market, and even if the government 
decides on numerical targets, they cannot be attained," the 
statement said in reference to U.S. demands for "objective 
criteria." 
  The statement also counterattacked the U.S. market, saying 
it 
was more exclusive than Japan's because each state requires its 
own license for new entries.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 20 KYODO -- A top Japanese automobile 
industry leader expressed reservations Thursday [20 January] 
over calls to settle stalled Japan-U.S. talks on auto parts 
purchases before the bilateral summit in Washington next month. 
  Yutaka Kume, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers 
Association, also told reporters there should be no 
misunderstanding on any agreement at the summit between Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton. 
  Kume recalled that the Japanese industry set a voluntary 
target for its auto parts imports during then President George 
Bush's Tokyo visit in 1992 but that the United States later 
characterized it as a "public pledge," which became a source of 
dispute. 
  He said such a situation must be avoided. 
  The U.S. is demanding in the talks that Japan set numerical 
targets for its auto parts imports.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 20 KYODO -- Japan's vice trade minister 
on Thursday [20 January] denied reports that U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor will visit Japan in an attempt to 
push stalled bilateral "framework" trade talks before the 
February Japan-U.S. summit. 
  Tokyo has not received such notification from the United 
States, Hideaki Kumano, vice international trade and industry 
minister, told a press conference. 
  Kumano said the reported visit by Kantor before the February 
11 meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and 
U.S. President Bill Clinton would "not be realistic" in view of 
a tight political schedule in Japan up to the summit. 
  Kumano dismissed reported U.S. accusations that Japanese 
bureaucrats are helping foot-drag progress in bilateral trade 
talks. 
  Tokyo has not received specific U.S. requests to improve the 
situation, Kumano said, adding the government has responded 
appropriately by holding talks with the trade minister when 
necessary.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 19 KYODO -- Japanese Finance Minister 
Hirohisa Fujii and U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen are 
likely to meet in Tokyo on Sunday [23 January] if their 
schedules allow, a top Finance Ministry official said Thursday. 
  "Arrangements are now being made in that direction," vice 
finance minister Jiro Saito told reporters. 
  Bentsen will make a stopover in Tokyo on his way back from 
visits to other Asian nations. 
  Saito said no official decision on the meeting has been 
made, 
nor has a possible time been set. 
  The meeting, if realized, would probably be to "exchange 
views frankly," he said.

  [Text] Washington, Jan. 20 KYODO -- President Bill Clinton 
said Thursday [20 January] the United States must reduce its 
trade deficits and identified Japan and China as "our biggest 
problems." 
  Clinton, speaking on a television talk show, said he is 
particularly distressed with trade gaps which he said are 
"structural and permanent." 
  "Our biggest problems are with Japan and now with China," he 
told the Cable News Network's "Larry King Live," a television 
talk show that is beamed worldwide. 
  "We are working on both of them," he said. 
  Clinton made the remarks in reply to a question from a 
caller 
who asked whether he favors increasing the local content of U.S. 
products in order to reduce the size of the U.S. trade deficit. 
  "I would like to lower our trade deficit, at least that 
which 
is structural and permanent," he said. 
  Clinton said the U.S. Government must, however, be "very 
careful" over the "Buy American" proposal because it might 
violate U.S. commitments under international trade treaties. 
  "We do have certain `Buy American' preferences in our laws, 
but we have to be very careful how far we go without violating 
treaties and agreements we make with other countries which take 
our products freely," he said. 
  Japan and China both run huge trade surpluses with the 
United 
States. 
  According to U.S. trade figures, Japan's bilateral trade 
surplus is running at more than 50 billion dollars a year, while 
China's tops 20 billion dollars.

its U.S. manufacturing arm to produce some 300,000 units this 
year, an increase of about 25 percent over the previous year, a 
company spokesman said Friday [21 January]. 
  Toyota Motor Manufacturing U.S.A. Inc. (TMM), based in 
Georgetown, Kentucky, turned out 234,000 units last year, the 
spokesman said. 
  TMM is scheduled to begin production at a second plant next 
to the current facility in late March. 
  The new plant will assemble the Camry, which is now built at 
the current plant, and the Avalon, TMM's new flagship car to be 
introduced this autumn. 
  Besides Camry sedans, the current Georgetown facility also 
produces and exports Camry station wagons and coupes to several 
foreign countries, including Japan.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 21 KYODO -- Defense Agency Director 
General Kazuo Aichi said Friday [21 January] that Japan should 
prepare for the eventuality of war on the Korean peninsula, even 
though there is no immediate danger. 
  "Although the Korean peninsula has not become particularly 
strained, considering the fact that tension exists there we must 
study how to respond to various situations arising from a 
hypothetical outbreak of conflict," Aichi told reporters. 
  Aichi was believed to be alluding to possible economic 
sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council against 
North Korea over Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons program. 
  North Korea has warned that it will not stand idle if 
subjected to an economic blockade. 
  On the question of Japanese support for U.S. troops based in 
Japan were such a conflict to break out, Aichi said it would be 
decided on a "case-by-case" basis. 
  "We would have to consider to what extent we could (lend 
support) in the context of maintaining the Japan-U.S. alliance," 
he said. 
  Defense Agency officials said the United States has already 
asked for Japan's support in such an event. They said the 
request is being considered primarily by the Foreign Ministry.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 21 KYODO -- A small Japanese trading 
firm which reportedly arranged for North Korea's purchase of 40 
obsolete submarines from Russia has been found in Tokyo, the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] reported 
Friday [21 January]. 
  The ministry, citing its own investigation, said it plans to 
ask the company's president about the allegation after his 
return from a trip overseas. 
  The company and its president were not immediately 
identified 
by name. 
  THE NEW YORK TIMES reported Thursday that a Japanese trading 
firm had arranged the deal between North Korea and Russia. 
  The ministry said it also plans to confirm the report with 
the Russian government through diplomatic channels.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 20 KYODO -- U.S. Central Intelligence 
Agency (CIA) Director James Woolsey has made an unpublicized 
visit to Seoul for talks with South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam and Defense Minister Yi Byong-tae, a South Korean daily 
reported Thursday [20 January]. 
  The HANGYORE SHINMUN said Woolsey flew into Seoul in secrecy 
on Tuesday to discuss the Korean situation amid international 
efforts to persuade North Korea to "abandon its nuclear program." 
  Woolsey had a breakfast meeting with the president on 
Wednesday and also met with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and 
Defense Minister Yi, apparently focusing on North Korea's 
alleged nuclear weapons development program, according to the 
daily. 
  The newspaper also said Woolsey conveyed to his South Korean 
counterpart Kim Tok the U.S. position that any imposition of 
sanctions on North Korea in regard to its nuclear program would 
be difficult at present. 
  It quoted an "authoritative" source as saying that South 
Korean Government officials, including President Kim, have 
raised the possibility of imposing economic and diplomatic 
sanctions as a way to force Pyongyang to improve the 
transparency of its nuclear development program. 
  The daily quoted a government official as saying that 
Woolsey 
also asked about South Korea's attitude to the possible 
normalization of U.S.-North Korean relations.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 20 KYODO -- A government-proposed 
political reform package barely scraped through a vote in a 
House of Councillors panel Thursday [20 January] morning, paving 
the way for a showdown vote in the full chamber that could make 
or break Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's five-month-old 
administration. 
  The upper chamber's Special Committee on Political Reform 
approved the package of four bills by a voice vote. 
  Eighteen committee members were in favor and 16 were 
against. 
  Hosokawa has staked his job on the passage of the political 
reform bills which call for members of the House of 
Representatives to be elected through a combination of 
single-seat constituencies and proportional representation, in 
place of the current multiseat constituencies. 
  Originally designed to clean up Japan's scandal-tainted 
political system, the package also calls for a limited 
tightening of curbs on political funds. 
  It remains unclear, however, whether the coalition can 
secure 
their passage by a full session of the upper chamber in view of 
dissent among some legislators of the Social Democratic Party, 
the biggest party in the ruling coalition. 
  The coalition, which hopes to have the vote by the full 
house 
on Friday, has a slim majority with a combined force of 131, 
compared with the opposition's 115. It needs 126 votes to be 
sure of winning. 
  The committee vote came after eleventh-hour talks Wednesday 
between the coalition and LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] failed 
to achieve a compromise over LDP demands to modify the bills. 
  The powerful lower chamber passed the package on November 
18.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 20 KYODO -- A special panel of the House 
of Councillors barely approved a government-proposed political 
reform package Thursday [20 January] morning, setting the scene 
for a showdown in the full chamber. 
  The vote by the full house is widely seen as make or break 
for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's five-month-old coalition 
government. 
  In a stand-up vote, the upper chamber's 35-member Special 
Committee on Political Reform approved the package of four 
bills, on which Hosokawa has staked his job, by 18 votes to 16. 
  Committee Chairman Yubun Ueno declared, "I recognize the 
fact 
that a majority of committee members voted for the bills" soon 
after a rebel member of the No. 1 opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP), Tomoichi Hoshino, surprised fellow LDP members by 
voting with the government. 
  Hoshino's rebellion against the LDP party line was 
apparently 
totally unexpected, and television coverage showed vexed LDP 
panelists looking around to see what had happened or pointing 
accusing fingers at him. 
  Hoshino said after the vote that he is quitting the LDP, 
which was ousted last August after 38 years in power. 
  It remains unclear, however, whether the coalition can 
secure 
passage of the bills by a full session of the upper chamber in 
view of dissent among some legislators in its biggest party, the 
Social Democratic Party [of Japan]. 
  The coalition, which hopes to have the vote by the full 
house 
on Friday, has a slim majority with a combined force of 131, 
compared with the opposition's 115. It needs 126 votes to be 
sure of winning. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, Hosokawa's chief 
spokesman, said the government welcomes the panel's vote. He 
suggested at a news conference that the government is ready to 
accept further bargaining with the LDP to prevent it from voting 
against the package in the full chamber. 
  At the outset of the panel session, a coalition legislator 
tabled a motion to dispense with a question-and-answer session. 
Ueno immediately put the motion to a stand-up vote. 
  After the vote was tied at 17 to 17, Ueno used his casting 
vote to pass the motion. 
  Kazuyoshi Shirahama, a legislator from Komeito, a key 
coalition party, then told the panel, "Now that a total of 60 
days have elapsed since the package was forwarded to the upper 
chamber, it is high time for us to put this historic reform 
package to a vote." 
  LDP Legislator Noriyuki Sekine warned, "If we pass it with 
only a slim majority, this legislation to completely redesign 
the mechanism of the electoral system that is the centerpiece of 
parliamentary democracy would disseminate causes for future 
problems in Japanese society." 
  Haruko Yoshikawa of the Japanese Communist Party also 
expressed opposition to the bills. "The fact that the coalition 
nixed a motion seeking witnesses to be called to elucidate 
suspicions over payoff scandals involving general contractors as 
well as the scandal over Prime Minister Hosokawa's acceptance of 
100 million yen from the Sagawa Kyubin Trucking Firm, shows it 
is not serious about stamping out money-dominated politics," she 
said. 
  Yukio Aoshima of the small Niin Club said, "Although the 
real 
wish of the public is to rid Japan of political corruption, such 
as payoff scandals involving contractors, the coalition 
sidetracked this crucial issue by falsely arguing that altering 
the electoral system could clear up corruption." 
  The committee vote came after eleventh-hour talks Wednesday 
between the coalition and LDP failed to achieve a compromise 
over LDP demands to modify the bills. 
  The package calls for drastically redesigning the mechanism 
for electing members of the powerful House of Representatives of 
Japan's two-chamber Diet. 
  It calls for the members to be elected through a mixture of 
single-seat constituencies and proportional representation, in 
place of the current multiseat constituencies, as well as 
unifying politicians' various funds-raising channels into the 
coffers of political parties. 
  The package cleared the lower chamber on November 18.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 20 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Thursday [20 January] expressed readiness to talk 
with Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) President Yohei Kono to 
reconcile differences over LDP proposals on modifying the 
government's political reform package. 
  Fielding questions from reporters, the premier said that 
whether the meeting with Kono takes place is entirely up to the 
LDP. 
  "If the LDP wants to hold the summit, I am ready to respond 
immediately," said Hosokawa, in an upbeat mood following the 
passage of the package through a House of Councillors committee 
earlier in the day. The vote was 18 for and 16 against. 
  The package is designed to redesign the mechanism for 
electing members of the House of Representatives of the 
two-chamber diet, while changing the political fund-raising 
system by channeling donations to politicians through their 
parties' coffers. 
  Kono, meanwhile, ruled out holding a meeting with Hosokawa 
on 
possible modifications of the package. 
  He told reporters at the LDP headquarters, "at present, 
there 
remains no room for us to advance suggestions" to the coalition 
side. 
  On Wednesday, negotiators from the coalition and LDP failed 
to narrow a gap over the LDP's three demands, including the one 
calling for raising from 274 to 280 the number of lower house 
seats to be contested as single-seat constituencies in a 
500-seat chamber.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 20 KYODO -- Social Democratic Party [of 
Japan] Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said Thursday [20 January] he 
might resign if a possible rebellion by several SDP [SDPJ] 
legislators led to the breakdown of a political reform package 
in Friday's vote at a full House of Councillors session. 
  "If the political reform package failed to clear the upper 
chamber as the result of SDP legislators' opposition, I will 
take the responsibility as the SDP chairman, as our party would 
not be able to disclaim resultant political responsibility," he 
said. 
  Murayama made the remark at a meeting of 73 legislators of 
the upper chamber, called one day before Friday's crucial vote 
that is regarded as make or break for the five-month-old 
administration of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  The upper house will hold a plenary session at 3 p.m. Friday 
to vote on the government-proposed package, upon which Hosokawa 
has repeatedly pledged to stake his political future. 
  The wording "take the responsibility" was immediately taken 
as expressing Murayama's readiness to give up his chairmanship 
of the largest party in the ruling coalition in such an 
eventuality. 
  Murayama pleaded with the legislators not to defect to the 
opposition side in voting on the package. 
  On Wednesday, three SDP legislators vowed to vote against 
the 
package, saying its loopholes undermines the package's ability 
to scare legislators away from taking bribes, while asserting 
the proposed 274 single-seat constituencies would deal a heavy 
blow to the SDP in a next election. 
  Five more SDP legislators have publicly voiced their 
opposition to the package, citing similar concerns about its 
possible adverse fallouts. 
  At least three other SDP legislators have abstained from 
vowing to comply with the SDP leadership's instructions to vote 
with the coalition in Friday's vote. 
  The coalition has only a slim majority in the 252 upper 
chamber. The majority is 126 votes, as its chairman Bunbei Hara 
is not qualified to vote. The opposition camp brandishes 117 
seats. 
  This means that defections of only nine SDP rebels to the 
opposition side could scuttle the package, unless similar 
defections on the LDP side broke up the LDP's unity. 
  Murayama said, "I want you to hand down your final judgments 
on the package with an eye to the issue of what would happen to 
the relationship between the cabinet and our party and how our 
party would be pressed to account for the failure of the 
package" if the package got bogged down. 
  The SDP, which has in the opposition for 38 years until the 
Liberal Democratic Party was ousted from power last August, 
finally could obtain six cabinet posts, including the office of 
minister in charge of political reform, in Hosokawa's 21-member 
cabinet. 
  The SDP, with its 76 upper house legislators, secured its 
intra- cabinet presence after a July 18 general election by 
throwing its political weight behind Hosokawa's bid to form a 
coalition government. 
  Murayama said Sadao Yamahana, a state minister charged with 
political reform, and other ministers may be expelled from the 
cabinet if the package were voted down.

<F P=106> [By Takehiko Kajita] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 20 KYODO -- With the passage of a set of 
government-sponsored political reforms through a key 
parliamentary panel on Thursday [20 January], Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa has one last hurdle to clear. 
  But that last test is perhaps the most difficult in his 
drawn 
out quest to implement sweeping reforms. 
  For Hosokawa, who has ardently pursued the introduction of 
measures necessary to eradicate rampant political graft in 
Japan, the clearance of his package through a special panel of 
the House of Councillors was a welcome development. But he is 
also keenly aware that the race is not over. The full upper 
house will meet Friday to put the bills to vote. 
  Although the governing coalition holds a slight majority in 
the 252-member upper chamber, it is uncertain whether Hosokawa 
can secure the votes he needs due to an anticipated revolt from 
some members of the largest force within the coalition, the 
Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ]. 
  Fearing wrath from the public and other coalition members if 
the bills fail, the SDP leadership has attempted to persuade its 
potential rebels to support the government package. 
  But some of its lawmakers openly say they will cross the 
party line mainly to object to the introduction of a new 
electoral system for the House of Representatives, which will 
drastically change the nation's electoral map and would further 
reduce the SDP's presence in national politics. 
  Among them, Masao Kunihiro, a staunch opponent of the 
package, reiterated his opposition, saying, "To ask me if I am 
for or against it is like asking the pope if he is a Catholic." 
  But a senior coalition official, who refused to be 
identified, said the SDP leadership appears optimistic about the 
course of the final vote in the full upper house. 
  "Mr. Kubo (the SDP secretary general) keeps saying, `The 
prospects are very grim,' but he has not looked so serious from 
yesterday," the official said. 
  Another factor clouding the fate of the government package 
-- 
and of the Hosokawa cabinet -- is the main opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP), knocked out of power last August after 
nearly 40 years of rule. 
  An unexpected revolt by Tomoichi Hoshino, an upper house LDP 
legislator, in Thursday's vote at a session of the second 
chamber panel, surprised the LDP, which had voiced confidence in 
unity among its upper house members. 
  Man Sasaki, chairman of the LDP Diet Affairs Committee in 
the 
upper house, told reporters the party will take all possible 
steps to prevent more of its legislators from voting with the 
government in the final vote. 
  Hosokawa, apparently in hope of securing the enactment of 
the 
reform legislation by the January 29 close of the current Diet 
sitting, stated there is room for further negotiations between 
the coalition and the LDP for a final compromise on the reforms. 
  While Hosokawa said he is ready to meet with LDP President 
Yohei Kono to bridge the gap between the two sides, Kono ruled 
out the idea. 
  The two men are both now in difficult positions. Hosokawa 
would have to step down along with all other cabinet ministers 
or dissolve the lower house for a general election should he 
fail to achieve his pledge to push the reforms through by 
January 29. 
  If the government reform package became law with no 
modifications, Kono would also face intense pressure from within 
his party to take responsibility for failure to change the 
legislation in its favor. 
  "He would eventually have to quit on his own," one LDP 
legislator noted.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 21 KYODO -- The outcome of a vote by 
the plenary session of the House of Councillors on Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's reform bills remains uncertain with 
the meeting due to start at 3 p.m. [0600 GMT] Friday [21 
January]. 
  Leaders of both ruling coalition parties and the opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party were continuing their efforts to 
persuade rebel members within their camps to vote in line with 
their parties' policies. 
  Hosokawa has reiterated his resolve to stake his political 
future on the package of four bills designed to introduce a 
combination of single-seat constituencies and proportional 
representation in the House of Representatives. 
  Failure to pass the bills could lead to Hosokawa's 
resignation or dissolution of the lower house for a general 
election, many political analysts said. 
  If enacted, the package could consolidate the political 
power 
base of Hosokawa, whose seven-party coalition government broke 
the LDP's 38-year grip on power last August, and trigger further 
realignments in the country's political arena, they said. 
  The seven coalition parties have a total of 131 seats in the 
252-member upper chamber while the opposition LDP, the Japanese 
Communist Party and Niin Club have 115. A simple majority of 
the full house is 126. 
  More than 10 upper house members of the Social Democratic 
Party (SDP), the largest force in the coalition government, 
however, have expressed opposition to the package, fearing the 
introduction of single-seat electoral districts in the lower 
house might deal a severe blow to the party. 
  Some LDP members are also expected to defy the party 
leadership and vote for the bills.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 21 KYODO -- The House of Councillors on 
Friday [21 January] voted down the government's political reform 
package, dealing a severe blow to the five-month-old 
administration of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  The vote was 118 for and 130 against. 
  The voting on the four bills came in an upper house plenary 
session that opened at 3 p.m. 
  Some members of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) 
[SDPJ], the biggest force in the seven-party coalition, voted 
against the package. Other SDP legislators abstained. 
  The SDP members who voted against the bills or abstained are 
said to be dissatisfied with the bill calling for a mixture of 
single-seat constituencies and proportional representation in 
elections for the House of Representatives. 
  The exact number of rebellious SDP members was not 
immediately available. 
  They outnumbered, however, those Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP) members who crossed party lines to vote for the bills. 
  Although the coalition earlier vowed to seek to revive the 
package through bargaining at the 20-member consultative Diet 
body comprising executives from both the coalition and 
opposition parties, the prospects of such a revival are 
virtually nonexistent, Diet sources said. 
  In the face of the failure of the package, Hosokawa has a 
choice of disbanding his cabinet or dissolving the House of 
Representatives for a snap general election. 
  If he chooses to have the cabinet resign en masse, Hosokawa 
would most likely quit as premier and another coalition leader 
would take over the post, analysts said. 
  If he opts for a snap general election, it would be seen as 
a 
call for the electorate's judgment on political reform but 
would, of course, be held under the current system of electing 
511 members of the lower chamber through multiple-seat 
constituencies.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 21 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Friday [21 January] he will pursue to the very end 
of the current Diet session on January 29 enactment of the 
political reform bills rejected by the upper house earlier in 
the day. 
  At a press conference following the rejection of the 
government-sponsored package of four bills by the House of 
Councillors, Hosokawa said he will do his utmost during the 
remaining days of the Diet session to have the package passed. 
  Hosokawa said he has no plans to dissolve the House of 
Representative for a snap general election or resign over his 
failure to have the bills clear the Diet. 
  The premier has repeatedly suggested he would step down or 
dissolve the lower house if he failed to get the political 
reform bills enacted. 
  Hosokawa said he will seek the enactment of the reform bills 
through a joint meeting of representatives from both chambers. 
  Under Article 59 of the Constitution, the lower house can 
call such a joint meeting to reach a compromise on bills 
rejected by the upper house. 
  The 252-member upper chamber voted down the bills aimed at 
introducing a election system combining single-seat 
constituencies and proportional representation in the lower 
house and changing the system of political fund-raising. The 
bills cleared the lower house on November 18. 
  A total of 17 upper house members of the Social Democratic 
Party [of Japan], the largest force in the coalition government, 
voted against the bills in defiance of the party line.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 21 KYODO -- The leadership of the Social 
Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the largest group in 
the coalition government, will likely come under pressure to 
resign after failing to unite its members in passing 
government-proposed political reform bills through the Diet, 
political sources said Friday [21 January]. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told a meeting of the party's 
legislators that "the party's responsibility is grave." 
  But Murayama did not specify if he will take responsibility 
for the failure by resigning as chairman of the largest force 
within the seven-party coalition government. 
  In a plenary session Friday afternoon, the House of 
Councillors voted down the package of four political reform 
bills with a vote of 130-118. 
  Although the seven coalition parties hold a majority in the 
252-seat upper house, 17 SDP members voted with the opposition 
to defeat the bills. 
  After the voting, Koken Nosaka, chairman of the SDP's Diet 
Affairs Committee, told reporters the failure of the bills "will 
be the responsibility of the (SDP's) leadership." 
  The SDP is expected to expel the 17 members who voted 
against 
the bills from the party, party sources said. 
  Murayama said Thursday he might resign if an expected 
rebellion by several SDP legislators led to the breakdown of the 
reform package in Friday's vote. 
  "If the political reform package fails to clear the upper 
chamber as a result of SDP legislators' opposition, I will take 
responsibility as the SDP chairman, as our party would not be 
able to disclaim resultant political responsibility," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 21 Kyodo -- Japanese business leaders 
expressed regret over the House of Councillors' rejection Friday 
[21 January] of the coalition government's political reform 
package. 
  Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic 
Organizations (Keidanren), said it was "highly regrettable" that 
the four political reform bills were killed. 
  Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry, called the failure a dark day for Japan and one that 
could further dampen the slumping economy. 
  Inaba also expressed concern that the setback for political 
reform could slow economic deregulation that had been promoted 
by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's administration. 
  Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of 
Corporate 
Executives (Keizai Doyukai), said a joint committee of both 
chambers of the Diet should compromise so that the package is 
enacted. 
  Takeshi Nagano, president of the Federation of Employers 
Associations (Nikkeiren), said failure to enact the package 
could heighten public distrust of politics and damage Japan's 
image overseas.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 21 KYODO -- Turbulence swept through the 
five-month-old administration of Prime Minister Horihiro 
Hosokawa Friday [21 January] after the House of Councillors 
voted to kill a political reform package on which he has staked 
his administration's fate. 
  The upper chamber rejected the package by 130 votes to 118, 
a 
margin of 12, after 17 defectors from the seven-party coalition 
undermined the coalition's unity. 
  The package of four bills was designed to completely 
overhaul 
the mechanism for electing the powerful House of 
Representatives, the lower house of Japan's two-chamber Diet, by 
introducing a 500-seat mixture of 274 single-seat districts and 
proportional representation. 
  The package is also designed to unify fundraising channels 
to 
direct all funds into the coffers of political parties, which 
would then distribute corporate donations among individual 
politicians. 
  Hosokawa, who rose to power after voters stripped the 
Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) of its 38-year lock on power last July, 
has repeatedly said he would place priority on passage of the 
package and vowed to "take responsibility" if it failed -- a 
euphemism for resigning or disolving the lower house for a snap 
general election. 
  However, Hosokawa told a news conference after the voting 
that he "is not thinking" of stepping down as premier or 
dissolving the lower house for the election. 
  "In the 10 days remaining before the end of the current Diet 
session I will do my utmost to push the political reform package 
through the Diet," the premier said. 
  He said he would do his best to hammer out a compromise 
package by arranging for the Diet to set up a 20-legislator 
consultative body, comprising 10 legislators from each chamber. 
  Yohei Kono, president of the No. 1 opposition LDP [Liberal 
Democratic Party], told a separate new conference, however, "The 
vote margin is serious enough to forestall thinking by the 
coalition of further moves they might take." 
  Kono pressed Hosokawa to live up to his repeated pledges to 
resign, saying, "It is extremely serious that the coalition 
could not secure passage even after it substantially extended 
the Diet session. He should consider these things." 
  Kono also suggested that he would consider a suprapartisan 
proposal to legislate an alternative bill to impose tough 
penalties on legislators who take bribes. 
  On August 10, Hosokawa told his first news conference after 
taking power that he would assume responsibility for failure of 
the package to clear the Diet by the end of the current Diet 
session, then tentatively set to end December 15. 
  After the package failed to clear the Diet by the 
provisional 
deadline, Hosokawa extended the session by 45 days until January 
29 and resumed his bid to push the package through the Diet. 
  The premier ruled out seeking to separately legislate the 
bill that would place stricter curbs on acceptance by 
politicians of shady political contributions. 
  Hosokawa said he wants to reconcile differences with the LDP 
through a summit with Kono. 
  He said his readiness to accept the LDP-proposed revision of 
the package grew following the failure to pass it, saying, "As 
the result of the developments in the Diet, there is greater 
room for a compromise with the LDP." 
  Koken Nosaka, chairman of the Social Democratic Party [of 
Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] Diet Affairs Committee, told reporters the 
SDP leadership would be pressed by coalition partners to account 
for the breakdown of the package. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told a meeting of SDP 
executives Thursday he would "take responsibility" as chairman 
of the party if the rebellion by some SDP legislators scuttled 
the package in Friday's vote. 
  A total of 17 legislators of the SDP, the biggest force in 
the seven-party coalition, voted against the package while two 
SDP legislators refrained from attending the voting session. 
  The dissenting SDP members have long criticized the package 
for carrying the possibility of undermining the parliamentary 
strength of the SDP, saying that the proposed 274 single-seat 
electoral districts would be disadvantageous to SDP legislators. 
  They have also chided the coalition for refusing to plug 
what 
they called "loopholes" in the package's anti-graft provisions 
designed to bar legislators from accepting bribes or buying 
votes. 
  Yasuo Nishino, one of the 17 SDP rebels, told reporters, 
"The 
Diet should place priority on legislating provisions to prevent 
bribe-taking." 
  The SDP dissidents outnumbered five LDP dissidents who 
crossed party lines to vote for the bills. 
  Meanwhile, Keiwa Okuda, chairman of the lower chamber's 
Steering Committee, said the lower chamber will convene its 
plenary session on January 25 to vote on a motion to ask the 
upper chamber to agree to establish the 20-member two-chamber 
consultative body. 
  If the two-chamber consultative body fails to work out a 
compromise bill, Hosokawa has the choice of disbanding his 
cabinet or dissolving the lower chamber for the election.

<F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa at the </F>
prime minister's official residence -- live] 
  [Text] [Unidentified dean of press corps] Allow me to 
first ask general questions. First of all, the political reform 
bills were killed today. What do you think of this? 
Especially, what do you think of the fact that many members of 
the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] voted against the 
bills? 
  [Hosokawa] First, I regret that the four political 
reform-related bills were defeated in the House of Councilors 
plenary session. I truly regret it. It is very regrettable 
that we could not respond to the expectations of many people. 
They had hoped the reform bills would be enacted as early as 
possible. But I am determined to make an all-out effort for the 
enactment of the bills, since there are about 10 more days 
before the end of the current Diet session. I plan to ask the 
Diet to decide, in accordance with constitutional procedures, 
how the reform bills should be handled from now on. 
Fortunately, Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP], and other LDP members have clearly stated that they 
will seek to realize political reform during the current Diet 
session. Thus, I hope negotiations between the LDP and the 
ruling coalition will start immediately. Now, you mentioned 
that some members of the SDPJ, the largest force within the 
ruling coalition, voted against the bills in line with their 
convictions. It is very regrettable, but I believe the party 
will continue to give full support to the ruling coalition. I 
strongly expect the party to do so. 
  [Dean of press corps] There seem to be big gaps between the 
government-proposed reform package and the reform plan put 
forward by the LDP. Does the government plan to make great 
concessions in negotiations with the LDP? Taking this stand, 
will the government negotiate with the LDP in accordance with 
constitutional provisions? 
  [Hosokawa] I am not quite sure how the negotiations will be 
promoted. I am not sure whether both sides will negotiate at a 
meeting of the conference committee of both houses. At any 
rate, this is basically a matter of Diet procedures and the 
lower house's choice. The government will have thorough 
discussions with the ruling parties. 
  [Dean of press corps] You said earlier you will ask the 
ruling parties to discuss the issue with the LDP in an attempt 
to have the bills passed during the current Diet session. I 
want to ask again how you will take your responsibility if you 
fail to have the bills passed during the current session, and I 
also want to ask if you have the possible dissolution of the 
House of Representatives or the resignation of the cabinet en 
masse in your mind? 
  [Hosokawa] Let me answer the latter question. I am not 
thinking about it. There are some days remaining. My biggest 
task now is to do my best to have the bills passed. 
  [Dean of press corps] Now, other reporters can ask 
questions. 
  [Unidentified reporter] The opposition camp points out that 
in a series of Diet deliberations, the ruling coalition's way of 
managing the Diet has been high-handed. Mr. Prime Minister, in 
your view, do you think the ruling coalition should conduct 
self-examination about some aspects of its management of the 
Diet? 
  [Hosokawa] Since the bills have been sent to the House of 
Councilors, about 70 days have passed and nearly 70 hours were 
spent on discussions. In view of this fact, I naturally think 
the Diet has been managed properly in accordance with 
parliamentary rules. My view is that the ruling parties' 
management of the Diet was not heavy-handed. I feel the ruling 
parties have respected the rules of Diet management as much as 
possible in managing the Diet. 
  [Unidentified reporter] You said earlier you will study 
possible negotiations with the LDP after seeing through moves 
within the ruling parties. In fact, a general view is that it 
is impossible to have the bills passed without the cooperation 
of the LDP either at the conference committee of both houses or 
at the House of Representatives. Basically, when negotiating 
with the LDP, do you intend to take a stand of making further 
concessions? 
  [Hosokawa] Well, I have no idea. But since the bills were 
rejected, I think the room for compromise has widened more than 
before. 
  [Unidentified reporter] I want to ask questions about this 
point. You have said discussions will be held at the conference 
committees of both houses, which means talks among 
representatives from each party or group. But are you 
considering holding a summit meeting with LDP President Kono 
immediately -- which, incidentally, I heard has been canceled -- 
before or after the discussions of the conference committees of 
both houses? 
  [Hosokawa] I have been saying it is a good idea to hold the 
meeting if the time is ripe, and my position is unchanged. But 
I need to see how discussions between the ruling parties and the 
opposition parties will develop. If the situation requires, in 
the process of the discussions, I will be willing to hold a 
summit meeting. 
  [Unidentified reporter] There are many remaining 
proposals, such as budget compilation and the issue of income 
tax reduction, which have to be discussed. Are you going to 
change the Diet schedule because the final decision on political 
reform will not be made until next week? 
  [Hosokawa] Well, the government, with the Economic Planning 
Agency at the center, is trying to draw up economic measures as 
soon as possible. We will start work on the third supplementary 
budget as soon as we finish forming the economic measures. 
However, we need to incorporate the economic measures in a 
budget. Moreover, some days will be needed for printing the 
budget. We will try to form the supplementary budget by 
shortening these processes as much as we can. We will continue 
our process of forming the 1994 budget. My feeling has not 
changed at all. I feel that we need to introduce economic 
measures as soon as possible in order to avoid creating 
apprehension about the current economic situation. There are 
many difficult issues, as you have pointed out. However, the 
government, regardless of the circumstances, will try to shorten 
the process as much as possible. I am sure we can shorten some 
clerical work. 
  [Unidentified reporter] I would like to ask you again about 
your political responsibility. You explained earlier, in 
response to a question regarding the possibility of dissolving 
the lower house in case discussions with the Liberal Democratic 
Party end up in failure, that you were not thinking about 
dissolution. Then, what kind of responsibility are you going to 
take should the discussions end in failure? 
  [Hosokawa] As I have said earlier, my task is to do my best 
during the remaining Diet session. We have more than 10 days 
left. I know I am repeating what I said earlier, but this is 
what I feel now. 
  [Unidentified reporter] When you became prime minister, you 
said you would take political responsibility should political 
reform not be realized before the end of the year [1993]. Now, 
you are saying you will realize it during the current Diet 
session. What are you going to do if you cannot do it before 
the end of the current Diet session? 
  [Hosokawa] We still have more than 10 days left before the 
current Diet session ends. I am saying that I will do my best 
during this period. 
  [Unidentified reporter] You have been trying to pass the 
four bills all at the same time. But, could you not separate 
the bill on prevention of political corruption from the other 
bills, and approve it first? 
  [Hosokawa] I do not think so. It is not a good idea to 
separate the bills. The LDP has been saying that too. Measures 
regarding prevention of political corruption are incorporated in 
the four bills. For example, the issues of transparency 
regarding relations between politics and money, and 
strengthening penal regulations are included in the bills. 
Moreover, I believe these measures will become effective when 
the political and electoral system reform bills are approved. 
Therefore, I do not think it is a good idea to separate the 
bills. This has been my fundamental stance and it has not 
changed. 
  [Unidentified reporter] The bills were not approved because 
some members of the Social Democratic Party voted against the 
bills. Do you think this will change or have some impacts on the 
coalition government? 
  [Hosokawa] I cannot say anything at this moment. I have to 
wait a little while. I hope what you have said will not happen.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 19 KYODO -- Three House of 
Representatives members of the United Social Democratic Party 
(USDP) will join the parliamentary group of the two coalition 
parties of Sakigake [Harbinger] and the Japan New Party (JNP), 
sources close to the group said Wednesday [19 January]. 
  Satsuki Eda, its leader and currently state minister in 
charge of the Science and Technology Agency, Shogo Abe, party 
secretary general, and Yanosuke Narasaki will join the group as 
early as next week after dissolving a parliamentary link with 
the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], they said. 
  The USDP, which was formed in March 1978, splitting the SDP, 
will decide to put an end to its 16-year history next Monday at 
a meeting, they said. 
  The other USDP lower house member, Naoto Kan, has already 
joined the parliamentary group. 
  Abe told a party meeting in early January that his party's 
historical duty to seek power change is over. 
  Eda has said that the USDP's dissolution would be a first 
step toward political realignment. 
  The USDP, which has also one seat in the House of 
Councillors, joined six other parties last August to form the 
seven-party coalition government ousting the Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP) from a 38-year grip on power following the general 
elections one month before. 
  The JNP is led by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, while 
Sakigake is led by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura.

and boosting the economy, government officials said. 
  The Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters headed by 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa consists of all cabinet members 
and Fair Trade Commission Chief Masami Kogayu. 
  The task force next week will decide on an administrative 
reform outline for fiscal 1994 and start drafting a list of 
deregulation items, the officials said. 
  Special private consultants may participate in the process, 
they said. 
  The headquarters will concentrate on such fields as housing 
construction and land for easing government controls, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 21 KYODO -- Japan posted a record 
surplus in its merchandise trade in 1993 for the second straight 
year, but monthly figures underscored the recent downward trend, 
the Finance Ministry said in a preliminary report Friday [21 
January]. 
  The customs-cleared trade surplus in 1993 came to 120.40 
billion dollars, up 12.9 percent from a year before, with the 
December surplus expanding 15.5 percent to 12.93 billion dollars 
after falling 2.2 percent in November to stop a consecutive 
year-on-year gaining streak of 34 months. 
  Briefing reporters, a ministry official said that monthly 
movements over the past year showed "substantial stability," 
especially in "the August-November period as the yen's 
appreciation started to undermine exports in terms of volume." 
  Exports in 1993 rose 6.3 percent to 360.98 billion dollars 
while imports gained 3.2 percent to 240.58 billion dollars. 
  In volume, exports fell 0.5 percent to post the first fall 
in 
seven years, while imports gained 4.4 percent for the first rise 
in two years. 
  The dollar averaged 111.39 yen in 1993, down 13.7 percent 
from the previous year's 126.64 yen. 
  The yen's appreciation since last January started to slow 
the 
surplus growth from August and the first contraction in 35 
months was posted in November. 
  Looking ahead, the official said the politically sensitive 
surplus is on the decline, but did not offer a clear outlook, 
saying "It depends on crude oil prices, exchange rates and 
economies at home and abroad." 
  Crude oil prices averaged 17.65 dollars per barrel, down 8.8 
percent from 19.36 dollars. 
  Many economists agreed that Japan's surplus has peaked, but 
said a sharp decline ahead is unlikely with the weak domestic 
economy undermining imports. 
  On a country basis, Japan registered a third straight rise 
in 
its trade surplus with the United States in 1993, gaining 15.2 
percent to 50.19 billion dollars, the third largest amount. 
  The surplus with the European Union fell for the first time 
in three years to 26.32 billion dollars, down 15.6 percent, and 
that with Asian nations topped that with the United States for 
the first time at 53.59 billion dollars, up 28.8 percent for the 
fourth rise in a row. 
  In the latest reporting month, exports rose 6.1 percent from 
year-earlier levels to 32.74 billion dollars, and imports inched 
up 0.7 percent to 19.80 billion dollars. 
  In volume, exports fell 2.4 percent for the fifth 
consecutive 
decline, and imports rose 4.6 percent for the 10th straight gain. 
  The official attributed the rise in December trade surplus 
to 
large exports of ships and to the sharply lower import value of 
crude oil and oil products due to a decline in crude oil prices 
that averaged 16.22 dollars, down 16.8 percent from 19.42 
dollars. 
  For both 1993 and December, sharp rises in exports were 
posted for microchips and chips, and steep declines in 
automobiles and audiovisual equipment. 
  Imports of crude oil and products posted notable decreases, 
and those of microchips gained sharply. 
  The ministry official pointed to the sharply lower export 
volume of automobiles -- Japan's key export item -- which fell 
22.3 percent to 392,000 vehicles in December. 
  On a country and area basis in the latest reporting month, 
Japan posted a trade surplus of 5.36 billion dollars with the 
United States, up 17.3 percent for the 21st rise in a row; 2.22 
billion dollars with the EU, up 9.7 percent; and 5.90 billion 
dollars with Asian nations, up 9.8 percent.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 20 KYODO -- The consumption tax may be 
renamed the "welfare tax" in a bid to win public support for 
raising it, government sources said Thursday [20 January]. 
  The issue has been deliberated within government circles for 
some time, the sources said. 
  The governing coalition has been under pressure to clarify 
the purpose of the tax in light of the rapid aging of Japan's 
population, they said. 
  It is also being argued that a name change could help win 
support for raising the current rate from 3 percent, a move that 
is strongly opposed by the Social Democratic Party [of Japan], 
the largest party in Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
coalition government. 
  The idea has met with criticism from some people engaged in 
various welfare programs, who fear that the amount of tax 
collected under that name might be regarded as a ceiling for 
welfare spending.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 20 KYODO -- The Posts and 
Telecommunications Ministry said Thursday [20 January] it may be 
forced to seek another raise in postal rates in the coming years 
despite an average 24 percent rate hike scheduled to take effect 
Monday. 
  The postcard rate will be raised to 50 yen from the present 
41 yen and the letter rate will to 80 yen from 62 yen. 
  The postal service is likely to record a single-year surplus 
of 50 billion yen in fiscal 1994, starting April 1, due to the 
hike, but is expected to register a deficit in fiscal 1997 due 
to rising labor costs and sluggish business demand for mail 
services, the ministry said. 
  The service is expected to have an accumulated deficit of 
177.7 billion yen at the end of fiscal 1993 next March 31. 
  At the end of fiscal 1996, the service will still have an 
accumulated deficit of around 45 billion yen, the ministry said. 
  The ministry attributed its pessimistic outlook to slumping 
corporate demand for mail for advertising. 
  The volume of mail increased by between 4.6 and 6.1 percent 
from fiscal 1988 to 1991, but the rate dropped to 1.9 percent in 
fiscal 1992. The rate for fiscal 1993 is estimated at somewhere 
between 1 and 2 percent. 
  The growth rate is likely to drop to the minus column in 
fiscal 1994, due to the rate increase, and remain at about 2 
percent in the following years, the ministry said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 20 KYODO -- The Commerce Chamber head 
on Thursday [20 January] urged the government to carry out an 
income tax reduction of 7 trillion yen in order to revive the 
ailing Japanese economy. 
  A substantially large-scale income tax cut is necessary in 
light of the delay in implementing a tax reduction, Kosaku 
Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 
told a press conference. 
  Inaba also said the government should begin studying a 
consumption tax hike as a means of covering the income tax cut, 
after confirming the economy has turn around. 
  Inaba said the ruling coalition parties and the opposition 
camp should do their utmost to avoid creating a political vacuum 
over the issue of political reforms. 
  The most urgent task facing the government is the formation 
of a third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 and the main 
budget for fiscal 1994, he said.

production remains sluggish so far in January, except in limited 
sectors including the semiconductor industry, the Economic 
Planning Agency (EPA) said in a survey published Tuesday [18 
January]. 
  It also said efforts to reduce inventories were making 
little 
progress. 
  Domestic shipments of videocassette recorders, refrigerators 
and washing machines in January recorded year-on-year increases, 
however. 
  In the nonmanufacturing sector, the value of lease contracts 
continues to decrease and domestic freight transport business, 
other than home delivery of parcels, remains slow, the EPA said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 19 KYODO -- Japan's regional banks 
painted a bleak outlook for the economy on Wednesday [19 
January] with a top official brushing aside recent market 
optimism resulting from buoyant personal consumption over the 
year-end. 
  "I didn't particularly get the feeling that the economy has 
turned brighter... from recent conversations" with various 
company heads, said Takashi Tanaka, chairman of the Regional 
Banks Association of Japan. 
  Companies have pushed forward with "restructuring" but the 
prolonged business slump is now forcing them to start "labor 
adjustments," he told a regular press meeting. 
  In a monthly survey of Japan's 60 regional banks released at 
the same time, the association said business activities in most 
regions are expected to remain weak over the next three months 
under "sluggish personal consumption and stagnant production 
despite expected steady home building and public works." 
  "The degree of stagnancy particularly in production is 
deepening," said the survey conducted in late November. 
  Considering the government's plan to use public funds in 
stimulating liquidity of the real estate market, Tanaka praised 
it as a "very good" option in economic measures. 
  But he expressed caution over linking the land program to 
measures on nonperforming loans at banks, saying, "we see no 
direct relation." 
  Tanaka reiterated his opposition to using public funds to 
help banks liquidate bad loans, and banks should take the 
"responsibility themselves." 
  He also expressed opposition to wider disclosure of problem 
loans and to active liquidation in the current fiscal year even 
at the cost of reporting net losses or sharp profit declines. 
  Regional banks are required to disclose only bad loans 
extended to insolvent customers, while Japan's 11 major 
commercial banks, known as city banks, are obligated to also 
announce loans that have produced no interests for six months or 
longer. 
  On liberalization of demand deposit rates, Tanaka called for 
"careful" and "thorough" discussions even if an adoption this 
year is delayed to realize a system of government-backed postal 
rates following private-sector rates. 
  The Finance Ministry, insisting on a system led by 
private-sector rates, is now negotiating with the Ministry of 
Posts and Telecommunications.

  [Text] Tokushima, Jan. 19 KYODO -- Gaishi Hiraiwa, head of 
the powerful Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), 
urged the government Wednesday [19 January] to implement 
effective pump-priming measures as soon as possible. 
  The Keidanren expects the government to take measures 
without 
interruption, said Hiraiwa, who visited this western Japan city 
to attend a meeting of regional business leaders. 
  No effective economy stimulus measures have been taken since 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa took office last August, he 
said. 
  He urged the government to reduce corporate taxes along with 
income tax cuts in view of flagging corporate expenditures. 
  Hiraiwa said it is inappropriate to discuss employment 
security and wage hikes as a matter of option. 
  Both are important problems and the Keidanren will continue 
to make efforts to realize both, he said. 
  Hiroshi Saito, vice chairman of the federation and chairman 
of the world's leading steel maker Nippon Steel Corp., who was 
present at the meeting, called for income tax cuts at least two 
years ahead of a consumption tax hike. 
  He proposed the floating of national bonds to secure funds 
for the tax cuts. 
  It is confusing to talk about pump-priming measures and a 
revision of the tax system in the long run at the same time, he 
said.

  Hosokawa told the second meeting of a special cabinet forum 
on employment that the government needs to put into practice as 
early as possible a program of creating more jobs that was 
worked out in mid-December by the Labor Ministry. 
  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, also present at the 
meeting, 
pledged fiscal support for the program, while Minister of 
International Trade and Industry Hiroshi Kumagai said his 
ministry plans to nurture promising industries such as 
biotechnology, new energy and information to create new jobs. 
  Labor Minister Chikara Sakaguchi, meanwhile, called for an 
early drafting of a new economic pump-primer by the government, 
saying improvement in the labor climate needs recovery of the 
economy.

  [Text] New York, Jan. 20 KYODO -- Japan's domestic 
telecommunications giant, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., 
said Thursday [20 January] it has paved the way for entry into 
the U.S. telecommunications market. 
  The former government-run monopoly said a contract was 
signed 
with U.S. mobile telecom firm Nextel Communications Inc. (CALL) 
on Thursday to form a partnership between the two companies. 
  Under the agreement, NTT will acquire a 0.9% stake 
in the 
U.S. partner for 75 million dollars and cooperate in the 
deployment of Nextel's digital mobile networks throughout the

  [Text] Osaka, Jan. 17 KYODO -- Sanyo Electric Co. said 
Monday [17 January] it will boost production of optical pickups, 
a key component for compact disc (CD) players, to meet rapidly 
rising demand. 
  Optical pickups are used to read digital signals for optical 
disks. 
  The Osaka-based consumer electronics company will raise 
overall production in Japan and overseas for its business year 
ending in November to 24.9 million pickups. 
  Optical pickups are in strong demand due to wider use of 
minidiscs and compact disc read-only memories (CD-ROMs). 
  Sanyo is churning out the high value-added electronic 
component in Japan, China and South Korea, with combined output 
coming to 14.7 million in the year which ended last November. 
  Currently, the company holds a 25 percent share in the 
global 
market, in which Sony Corp. commands the lion's share of about 
60 percent, according to industry analysts. 
  They say total sales are expected to gain 20 percent to 72 
million pickups in the world marketplace.

  [Text] The Ideology and Culture Department of the Communist 
Party of Vietnam [CPV] Central Committee held an international 
news conference in Hanoi on 19 January to announce the purpose 
of the mid-term national party conference. 
  The conference, presided over by Comrade Ha Dang, head of 
the 
department, was attended by a large number of foreign 
correspondents. 
  Also present were Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai and the 
deputy head of the CPV Central Committee's Foreign Relations 
Department, Pham Van Chuong. 
  Comrade Ha Dang said: This is the first time that a mid-term 
conference of the Central Committee has been held. The 
conference is not an exception, as it is organized in accordance 
with Article 15 of the party statutes passed at the seventh 
party congress. Apart from other important tasks, the conference 
will hold a by-election to choose a number of Central Committee 
members. The number of candidates to be elected in this 
by-election, as stipulated in the party statutes, must not 
exceed 10 percent of the total Central Committee members elected 
at the seventh party congress. 
  A XINHUA correspondent asked what will be the standards for 
new members elected? 
  Ha Dang said: There are four major standards: Candidates 
must 
have good political acumen, working ability, and ethical 
integrity, and they must also be relatively young -- less than 
55 years of age. He went on: 
  [Ha Dang] That is the principle for selection. But 
there will be some amount of flexibility. 
  A BANGKOK POST correspondent asked: Mr. Department Head, one 
of the tasks for the period ahead -- as outlined in the 
political report to be presented at the mid-term party 
conference -- is to renovate and rectify the party and 
strengthen the relationship between the party and the people. 
What will the CPV do to attract the participation of the 
younger generation, as the majority of youths has never been 
through war? 
  [Ha Dang] Our party has been associated closely with 
the people since its founding. This relationship has originated 
from the fact that all tasks set forth by the party as well as 
its interests conform to the demands of the nation, for example, 
fighting for national independence and building socialism to 
bring about a beautiful life for the people. While implementing 
these tasks, we have scored countless achievements. Besides 
these achievements, there are shortcomings. To remain closely 
attached to the people, it is our immediate duty to unfailingly 
develop achievements and overcome shortcomings and deficiences. 
I would like to tell you that the majority of our party members 
is young. 
  An Australian Television correspondent asked if there would 
be any Central Committee plenums following this mid-term 
conference. Also, if the shortcomings to be raised will involve 
corruption and will have anything to do with the party. 
  [Ha Dang] There will be no Central Committee plenums 
held [immediately] after the mid-term national party conference. 
With regard to personnel changes in the Political Bureau, as you 
know, nothing will be changed, except for the replenishment of a 
number of members. The party will never change its name. This is 
because our party and people love the name of the Communist 
Party. As for the question of corruption, we regard this as a 
harmful practice. We will resolutely struggle to overcome and 
eliminate the harmful practice of corruption. Whatever their 
positions, corrupt officials must be punished in accordance with 
their offenses. 
  [Correspondent] I am a REUTER correspondent. Mr. Ha 
Dang, will the events in East Europe and the former Soviet Union 
cause the CPV to revise its diplomatic and political 
policies? 
  [Ha Dang] We are firm on Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi 
Minh thought. We will continue to firmly maintain our course of 
development along the socialist path. All these things do not 
contradict our efforts to broaden our international relations 
and cooperation with many countries, international 
organizations, and different economic forces. It is the purpose 
of our renovation process to ensure successful national 
construction and defense. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Article" by Station Correspondent Tran Thien Nhien: </F>
"Seventh Party Congress' Feelings at Mid-Term "] 
  [Text] Not long ago, a saying spread around fully 
describing the fine image of the first path of our party 
renovation undertaking. Based on the meanings of the Roman 
numbers, it predicted that, after the Sixth Party Congress, life 
would be happy. This folk saying fully reflects the people's 
dream and absolute belief in the success of the renovation 
undertaking initiated and lead by our party. That belief is the 
foundation for our political stabilization; and political 
stabilization is a prerequisite for socioeconomic stabilization 
and development. 
  By the end of 1993, we had covered exactly half the term of 
the Seventh Party Congress. What can be said about the work? 
  In retrospect, we remember that at the middle of the year we 
used to readjust our planning so as to lower our targets. This 
was in order to allow us to achieve something by the end of the 
year. Now, difficulties, obstacles, and dangers still exist. 
But in only three years, we have accomplished many jobs planned 
for five years. Is this not a fine characteristic of the new 
stage? 
  On hearing that the world hailed our government's good 
economic management, an economist made a nice but hardly 
surprising statement: The cutting down of the inflation rate 
from 57.6 percent to 4 percent within a period of three years is 
not an easy job for any country. He also added: As an insider, 
sometimes we cannot fully realize the significance of our work. 
However, outsiders can see more clearly when they compare our 
achievement with the real situation in the world. 
  As a matter of fact, five years ago nobody in the world 
thought that Vietnam would survive when the USSR and European 
socialist countries collapsed. Nobody thought that Vietnam's 
poor, backward agriculture, permeated with continuous natural 
disasters, would become the world's third biggest rice exporter. 
Nobody foresaw that the 500-kilovolt National Transmission Line 
-- which foreign specialists said that would only appear in 
Vietnam after the year 2000 -- would come into existence and 
start operating in the early second quarter of this year. 
Somebody said that if wage reform is applied when the economy 
is still in crisis, chaos will follow and inflation will 
increase. That prediction has been totally discredited by the 
real situation of 1993. These fine things have happened against 
the background of many changes in the world. Should we not be 
proud of ourselves? 
  Life is like a difficult mathematical problem. When we do 
not try to solve it, we think it impossible to solve; but when 
we start doing it, especially when we have completed one 
calculation, the possibility of solving the problem will appear 
clearer, giving us more confidence and energy to finish it. 
Another interesting thing is that not only mathematicians 
understand this. 
  As the economist has stated, it is certain that it was not 
diplomatic politeness which directed the world's two monetary 
organizations to appraise Vietnam as the best economically 
managed country in Asia for 1992. It is also not coincidental 
that the Donors' Conference in Paris was so successful. And 
recently, the Paris Credit Club of 11 developed countries, 
including the United States, decided to reduce Vietnam's debts 
by 50 percent and grant Vietnam extra time to repay its debts -- 
in 23 years' time. 
  We highly evaluate, treasure, and appreciate the support of 
the world community for our national construction undertaking. 
We also clearly realize and correctly evaluate our 
achievements. Nobody is fool enough to pour money into a 
bottomless pit. Nobody wants to deposit one dong to recover 
just one dong. And nobody wants to invest in a country with a 
chaotic political situation, where different parties and groups 
are fighting for more power in parliament rather than striving 
to improve the national economy. 
  The economic development and political stabilization in our 
country in the past years have helped us to create this 
opportunity. They also prove the correctness of an important 
concept in our party renovation line for national construction: 
that is, accumulations must be obtained mainly from our internal 
economy. External factors are very important, but internal ones 
are more significant in creating an economic impact. 
  We must strive to develop our economy while step by step 
improving our people's daily life, strengthening national 
defense, ensuring political security, and maintaining stability 
in order to further develop. We must also strive to open our 
door so as to promote relations with foreign countries and to 
learn from their experiences while consistently defending our 
national independence and sovereignty, and formulating correct 
lines and policies in conformity with our country's conditions 
and our people's aspirations. These are the great tasks that we 
must satisfactorily carry out. 
  With this as a reality, His Excellency Lee Kuan Yew, a 
renowned strategic development planner in Singapore, recently 
spoke to Western newsmen about Vietnam's current development, 
saying that the matter does not depend on the one party or 
multiparty system but rather on the leadership's ability to 
develop the national economy. 
  It is not too much of an exaggeration to say that one of the 
Vietnamese people's significant contributions to mankind's 
development in the post Cold War period is that differences in 
ideology and political systems are simply not the cause of 
hostility and an uncooperative atmosphere among nations. 
  Today Vietnam is a socialist country that enjoys relations 
with 167 countries in the world. Whether we choose to adopt a 
conservative or progressive stand, we are ready to join the 
international community while maintaining our own political 
system. 
  Thus far, we have completed the first half of the Seventh 
Party National Congress' term. The remaining second half is 
very promising, yet with immense obstables. The new era will 
also bring new difficulties and ordeals. While we are seeking 
investment capital for development, we must strive to map out 
plans to use this capital in the most effective way. In the 
past, we strove to extricate our country from encirclement and 
isolation; now we are striving to open our door while 
maintaining our national characteristics. In the past, we 
strove to attain a firm economic foothold; we are now working 
hard to maintain our economic growth. In the past, we also 
experienced corruption and smuggling. These and other social 
vices are now developing and becoming serious while laws and 
discipline are loosely observed. In the past we worked hard to 
produce enough grain for our own consumption; we now talk about 
how to sell more rice at higher prices and how to narrow the gap 
between peasants in the rural and mountain regions and people in 
the city; how to eliminate the division between the rich and the 
poor caused by the market economy; how to firmly maintain the 
ideal objectives charted by our party and state; and how to cope 
with hostilities carried out by reactionaries at home and 
abroad. However, these difficulties and ordeals cannot be 
resolved overnight. 
  It is necessary to say that while there are changes for the 
better in society, our infrastructures are still poor and 
backward. More than two million city dwellers are unemployed; 
more than 200,000 prostitutes have not been reeducated; 70,000 
drug addicts have not been cured; AIDS is increasing; and so 
forth. 
  We cannot belittle this situation in our country, but we 
must 
stay calm while finding ways and means to step by step resolve 
these issues with confidence. This is the correct attitude for 
coping with difficulties. 
  In the upcoming Vietnamese Lunar New Year, people in Hanoi 
and Haiphong as well as the Vietnamese community in Moscow will 
have the chance to enjoy Tam San rice fragrant rice, the 
renowned traditional rice of Nam Ha province, packed in 
beautiful plastic bags -- the new product of the Hanoi 
Export-Import Corporation Union, which will be put on sale at 
home and abroad during the New Year. The corporation director 
said that if we want to compete in the world rice market, we 
must plant and sell our traditional good quality rice such as 
the Tam San and Nep Tam San [fragrant sticky rice] and so forth, 
which were not promoted in the recent past. To restore the 
planting of these varieties of rice, we must find the markets 
and invest money to produce seeds, zone off planting areas, 
restore the traditional method of cultivation, and improve 
processing and management in accordance with modern 
technological systems so as to attain the highest economic 
result. 
  There are currently new things in our society. However, in 
daily life we sometime need the old things. If we can restore 
the old things we need with the application of modern 
technology, we will obtain a better result.

Central Committee's political report delivered by General 
Secretary Do Muoi at the opening of the Mid-Term National Party 
Conference at the Ba Dinh Conference Hall in Hanoi on 20 January 
-- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Dear comrade advisers to the party Central 
Committee, comrade delegates, and comrades: On behalf of the 
party Central Committee, I would like to present the committee's 
political report to the National Party Conference. 
  The sixth party congress set forth the renovation policy and 
created a turning point in the cause of socialist construction 
in our country. The seventh party congress evaluated the 
results of five years of carrying out the renovation process 
according to the socioeconomic development platform and 
strategy. It also put forth the orientations and measures for 
conducting the renovation process in a far-reaching and uniform 
manner. 
  The international situation has developed quickly and become 
complicated since the seventh party congress. The socialist 
regimes in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have 
collapsed. The independence and sovereignty of a number of 
countries have been challenged by policies based on power and 
imposition. The hostile forces are stepping up their activities 
in a bid to undermine our people's cause of national 
construction and defense. Once again, our revolutionary 
undertaking is facing harsh challenges. 
  The international situation presents new opportunities, 
however. The strength and determination to struggle for national 
independence and sovereignty have been consolidated. The trends 
of cooperation and development have prevailed in the world 
community. The revolutionary forces have learned valuable 
lessons from their temporary setbacks. The success of our 
country's renovation policy has further consolidated our 
people's strength and position, thus creating the conditions for 
us to overcome difficulties and take advantage of good 
opportunities to serve the cause of national construction. 
  Faced with new challenges and opportunities, our party and 
people have adopted a firm political stance. The resolutions of 
the party Central Committee's Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth 
Plenums have concretized and further developed the line set 
forth by the seventh party congress, resolving a series of 
practical problems on the domestic and diplomatic fronts based 
on actual international developments and real-life situations. 
We have persisted in the renovation undertaking, accelerated 
socioeconomic development, broadened the process of 
democratization, firmly maintained political stability, 
consolidated our national defense and security capabilities, 
diversified our diplomatic activities, and gradually overcome 
the impact of blockade and embargo. 
  The National Party Conference has the duty to assess the 
implementation of the seventh party congress resolution and 
evaluate the actual results of the renovation undertaking since 
the sixth party congress. The objectives of this are to clarify 
further a number of issues relating to the process of socialist 
construction in our country and define major policies and 
measures to implement the seventh party congress resolution 
successfully and lead the revolutionary undertaking in our 
country forward. 
  Part One: The situation concerning the implementation of the 
seventh party congress resolution. 
  I. Achievements 
  1. The great achievement of primary importance is the 
fact that we have succeeded in overcoming the socioeconomic 
crisis to a very important extent. 
  The crisis began in the late 1970's and early 1980's. It 
lasted for many consecutive years and became most serious from 
1986-88, with inflation at a gallop. Another menace occurred in 
1991. Thanks, however, to the great efforts of our party, 
state, and people, our national economy not only held fast but 
recorded outstanding achievements and overcame sluggishness and 
recession. The economic growth rate has remained very high and 
steady for the past three years. 
  Inflation was cut from 67 percent in 1991 to 17.5 percent 
in 1992, and then to 5.2 percent in 1993. The GDP shows an 
average annual increase of 7.2 percent, compared with the 
1991-95 target of 5.5 to 6 percent. 
  Agricultural production has developed in a relatively 
comprehensive manner. The food grain issue has been resolved 
satisfactorily. The output of food grain in 1993 amounted to 
nearly 25 million tons, thus exceeding the target for 1995. 
  Industrial production is growing at an average annual rate 
of 
13 percent, higher than the 8 to 10 percent target set in the 
five-year plan for 1991-95. 
  The productivity of a number of important sectors and 
products -- such as electricity, crude oil, steel, and cement -- 
has increased. The communications and liaison system has 
expanded rapidly through the use of new equipment and technology. 
  Many sectors -- such as building, transport, trade, travel, 
and other services -- have developed. The economy is undergoing 
structural changes. A number of production and business sectors 
have emerged. 
  Foreign economic relations have expanded, becoming more 
diversified and multilateral. We have overcome the results of 
the unexpected drop in trade with our traditional market, 
broadened our trade exchanges with newer trading partners, and 
increased our annual export volume by nearly 20 percent. 
  By the end of 1993, some 836 foreign investment projects had 
been licensed, with a registered capital of $7.5 billion. We 
have begun to attract more development aid and preferential 
capital loans from various governments, and have normalized 
relations with international financial and monetary institutions. 
  The economy has achieved some initial capital accumulation. 
Although this is still small, a broad section of the population 
has seen their lives improve. A multisector economic system is 
taking shape. State firms are beginning to be rearranged and 
re-registered. State firms with long histories of operational 
losses have been reduced in large numbers, while the number of 
state firms with effective operations has increased. 
  Generally speaking, the state-run economic sector is 
continuing to develop. It controls key fields of activity and 
is playing an essential role in the national economy. The 
state-run economic sector's share of the GDP increased from 34 
percent in 1990 to 39.9 percent in 1992. 
  Agricultural cooperatives have developed much clearer 
orientations for renovation since the party Central Committee's 
fifth plenum. The autonomous role of peasant households has 
been affirmed. A number of new formats for economic cooperation 
have emerged. The Land Act officially gave peasants the right 
to the long-term and stable use of the land. This has helped 
the peasant household-based economy gain momentum in 
development. Individual economies and private capitalist 
economies have developed remarkably. Share-holding and 
partnership enterprises, which are attracting capital investment 
from various forms of ownership, have emerged in increasingly 
large numbers. 
  The market system, which is under state management along 
socialist lines, is becoming a driving mechanism in the economy. 
  The amendment of laws and the continued renovation of 
various 
systems and policies on planning, pricing, the exchange rate, 
finance, banking, labor, wages, and the land have created a more 
favorable environment for various firms to develop dynamism, 
self- motivation, and a sense of self-responsibility in 
production and business. The state has accumulated more 
experience and made progress in the macromanagement of the 
national economy. 
  In parallel with economic development, the resolution of 
various social issues and the implementation of various social 
welfare policies have been given more attention. 
  Thanks to an increase in production and services, market 
prices have become relatively stable and the lives of people in 
various urban and rural areas have been improved. The number of 
rich households has increased while the number of needy 
households -- especially the number of underfed households -- 
has been reduced. The people's basic need for food and clothing 
has been met in a more satisfactory way. 
  The construction of houses, roads, electrical facilities, 
and 
health establishments has developed in various rural and urban 
areas. 
  Democratic rights -- especially economic democracy -- have 
developed gradually. The people are free to work according to 
the law. They feel more secure about putting their money into 
production and business, thus creating more jobs. 
  Various policies -- such as the policy of tackling 
unemployment; the policy of eliminating hunger and poverty; the 
policy toward war invalids, families of fallen heroes, and 
people who have performed meritorious deeds for the revolution; 
the policy of providing assistance to disabled, helpless, and 
homeless people; and the policy of helping needy students return 
to school -- have been carried out satisfactorily. 
  Educational activities have made some progress in fighting 
degradation, diversifying various educational formats, 
rearranging the school network, consolidating the system of 
specialized schools and selective classes, and building general 
education schools for ethnic minority students. The 
popularization of education has begun to develop satisfactorily. 
Vocational training and the study of foreign languages and 
computer technology have developed in various cities. 
  Science and technology have started to develop as a driving 
force. Scientific and technological studies have been linked 
with social requirements. Many research and application 
projects -- especially in agriculture, fisheries, consumer 
goods, and export goods -- have developed their practical value. 
They have helped to increase economic results and improve 
technological knowledge. 
  The system of state-level scientific study programs has 
become more centralized, and for the first time has included 
programs on social science and the humanities. 
  Cultural activities have become more lively. Cultural 
exchanges with foreign countries have been expanded. Literary 
and artistic works have become more copious in terms of content 
and theme, and more diversified in terms of form, category, and 
means of expression. 
  The information system has made new steps in development 
with 
the expansion of radio and television transmission coverage to 
various districts throughout the country, including a number of 
mountain and high-altitude areas and distant offshore islands. 
  Health care activities for the improvement of the people's 
health have shown great progress in various fields, such as 
preliminary health care, expanded immunizations, and the control 
of epidemics and social diseases. Requirements for essential 
medicine have been partially met. Physical education and sports 
has achieved encouraging results. 
  Work on population and family planning has been carried out 
correctly, leading to an increase in the number of people 
voluntarily registering for the birth control program. 
  2. The second important achievement is the continuation of 
political maintenance and consolidation. Because of our success 
in many areas of renovation -- especially the socioeconomic 
achievements, the party's skillful leadership, and the political 
awareness of the country's people and soldiers -- we have 
survived the recent international political shock. The party's 
leadership role has been strengthened, the state's management 
efficiency has been heightened, democracy has been broadened, 
and national defense and security have been guaranteed. The 
people's confidence in the party, state, and renovation 
undertaking has increased and public movements for socioeconomic 
improvement have developed. 
  After the seventh national party congress, our party -- 
especially the party Central Committee, the Political Bureau, 
and the Secretariat -- accelerated party building work, 
considering this to be a duty of crucial importance to the 
entire revolutionary cause in our country and to our party. The 
third party plenum confirmed that economic development is the 
central duty and party building is the fundamental duty. It 
clarified conceptions on party building work when the party is a 
ruling party, and defined principles for the party's 
organization and activities. It outlined the duties for 
consolidating the unity and unification of the entire party. It 
renovated and strengthened logical and ideological work and 
consolidated the party organization system. 
  After more than a year of party building work, we have 
improved and heightened our knowledge and responsibility toward 
party committees and party members. We have rearranged the 
party organization system and reestablished cadre committees to 
oversee party committees and youth unions in state organs and 
mass organizations. The function and role of grassroots party 
organizations, together with their working procedures and 
personnel management regulations, have been established. Party 
principles -- especially the principle of democratic centralism 
for the restoration of order and principles -- have been 
executed. Party management and work attitudes have been 
revamped in a more democratic, collective, and appropriate 
manner to ensure close and efficient party leadership and expand 
the positive role of state organs and mass organizations. 
  We have concentrated more on training and admitting new 
party 
members. In 1992, admission of new members increased by 39 
percent over 1991. In 1993, it increased by 30.7 percent over 
1992. 
  The party has continuously renovated its thinking and paid 
more attention to logical and ideological work. It has 
clarified concepts and principles for guiding the renovation 
cause and has gained more leadership experience. Party cadre 
have become more mature and active, and have gradually grown 
accustomed to leadership and management work in the renovation 
undertaking. 
  Our social democracy has made significant strides over the 
past two years, together with the construction of a law-governed 
state of the people, by the people, and for the people. The 
most prominent event was the promulgation of the 1992 
Constitution. That helped to institutionalize rapidly the 
party's line on national construction along socialist lines. 
The implementation of constitutional stipulations in the fields 
of politics, the economy, culture, education, industry, security 
and national defense, and the citizen's fundamental rights and 
obligations -- together with the introduction of many new legal 
documents and regulations -- have further accelerated the 
democratization process in our social activities. 
  The Fatherland Front and mass organizations have diversified 
their activities to broaden the national great unity block, 
motivate the public to carry out its political duties, 
accelerate social activities, provide good care for the people, 
and protect their interests. 
  Mass motivation work has been given more attention by party 
committees at different levels. Coordination between state 
organs and the fatherland fronts and mass organizations has been 
strengthened more than ever in motivating the public to take 
part in law-building work; the planning of national policy; the 
formation of local authorities; and the implementation of the 
policies relating to the socioeconomy, security, and national 
defense. 
  The armed forces, together with the public, have made many 
efforts to accelerate the renovation cause in the areas of 
national defense and security, and in developing their own 
strengths. They have executed their duty to protect the 
socialist fatherland; guarantee political stabilization; and 
safeguard national independence, sovereignty, and integrity in a 
satisfactory manner. 
  We have successfully implemented the great strategic 
adjustment in national defense, reduction in military personnel, 
and the strengthening of the universal defense system. We have 
built regional defense networks in provinces and cities, 
adjusted the strategy for national security protection, revamped 
our military activities in the new situation, gained better 
knowledge regarding the current situation, and become more 
efficient in fighting the activities of hostile forces.

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] 'Inflation has been pushed 
back, from 67 per cent in 1991 down to 17.5 per cent in 1992 and 
only 5.2 per cent in 1993. [passage omitted] 
  'The external economic relations have been broadened in the 
line of diversification and multilaterization. We have overcome 
the consequences of the sudden [words missing] of our 
traditional market, widened the interflow with new partners, and 
increased the export value by roughly 20 per cent annually. Up 
to the end of 1993, we have granted 836 licences for direct 
foreign investment with a total registered capital of 7.5 
billion USD recorded initial successes in attracting more 
development assistance and loans on preferential terms from 
governments and reestablished normal relations with 
international financial and monetary institutions. 
  'The economy has started to yield internal accumulations, 
albeit small. The life of the majority of the population has 
been improved. 
  'A multi-sector economic structure is taking shape. Initial 
steps have been taken to re-arrange and re-register state 
enterprises. The number of long-time loss-making enterprises 
has been largely reduced. The number of efficient business 
units has increased. In general, the state economic sector has 
kept developing and continues to hold key areas and a leading 
role in the national economy its share in GDP has grown from 34 
per cent in 1990 to 39.9 per cent in 1992. Since the 5th plenum 
of the Central Committee, the agricultural cooperatives have got 
a more clearly defined orientation for renewal the autonomous 
role of the peasant households has been confirmed. New forms of 
the cooperative aconomy have appeared. Wuth the land law 
formally granting peasants the right to use land has got 
additional development motive. The individual economy on a 
stable and durable basis, the peasant household economy and 
private capitalist economy have developed considerably. There 
have emerged a growing number of stock holding enterprises and 
joint ventures with investments from various forms of ownership. 
  'The market mechanism under management by the state and with 
socialist orientation is becoming the operational mechanism of 
the economy. The amendment of laws and the continous renewal of 
the mechanism and policies related to planning, pricing, 
exchange rates, finance, banking, labour, remuneration, land..., 
have created a more favourable environment for the enterprises 
to bring into full play their dynamism, autonomy and 
self-responsibility in production and business. 
  'The state has accumulated more experience, and made 
progress 
in the macro-management and administration of the national 
economy... 
  'The second most important achievement is that we have 
maintained and consolidated political stability. 
  'Thanks to the many-sided achievements of renewal, 
especially 
socio-economic achievements, thanks to the firm leadership of 
the party and the political awareness of the people and armed 
forces throughout the country, we have surmounted the recent 
political upheaval in the world. The party's leading role has 
been consolidated, the state's management effeciveness has been 
heightened, democracy has been broadened, national defence and 
security have been secured, the people's confidence in the 
party, the state and the renewal process has been strengthened, 
and the mass movement in certain economic and social fields has 
been some development... 
  'The third achievement is that our external relations have 
been expanded, our country's prestige in the world has been 
heightened, and a favourable international environment has been 
created for our efforts in national construction and defence. 
  'The 7th congress defined the task related to our foreign 
policy which is to maintain peace, broaden relations of 
friendship and cooperation, create favourable international 
conditions for national construction and defence, while actively 
contributing to the common struggle of the world people for 
peace, national independence, democracy and social progress. 
The congress emphasized the open character of our foreign 
policy: 'Vietnam wishes to be a friend of all nations in the 
world community, endeavouring for peace, independence and 
development.' 
  'In the face of the new developments of the world and 
regional situation after the 7th congress, the third plenum of 
the central committee concretized and developed that line. We 
have taken the initiative and actively expanded our external 
activities, and have recorded very important results. 
  'We have restored normal relations with the People's 
Republic of China and initially developed relations of 
friendship and cooperation with it, 'strengthened and 
consolidated our relationship of special solidarity with the Lao 
People's Democratic Republic, signed and strictly implemented 
the Paris Agreement on Cambodia, and established friendly 
neighbour relations with the Kingdom of Cambodia. 
  'We have improved and opened a new stage in our relations of 
cooperation and friendship with ASEAN vountries and with ASEAN 
as an organization and expanded our relations with other 
countries in Asia and the Pacific. 
  'We have preserved and developed our traditional relations 
with Cuba, India and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
  'We have maintained and promoted our existing relations of 
cooperation with the Russian Federation, other countries of the 
former Soviet Union, and Eastern European countries. 
  'We have accorded continuous support to the just cause of 
the 
peoples of Palestine, other Arab nations and South Africa, 
broadened our relations with developing countries in Asia, 
Africa and Latin America and contributed actively to the 
consolidation of the Non- Aligned Movement and the promotion of 
its role in the new situation. 
  'We have improved our relations with countries of Western 
Europe, Northern Europe and the European Economic Community, 
with Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and newly 
industrialized countries. We have restored normal relations with 
international financial and monetary organizations. The process 
of struggle to get the United States lift the embargo and 
normalize relations with Vietnam has made certain progress'. 
  On weaknesses and and newly emerging issues, the report 
says: 
  'The ecomomy retains the character of a backward 
agricultural 
economy. Industries remain minor and infrastructure facilities, 
underdeveloped. Not much has been achieved in the construction 
of the material and technical basis. Accumulation from within 
the economy and develophent investments are still limited and 
not given adequate attention. Although the economy has known a 
fairly high growth rate, productivity, quality and efficiency 
remain very low. Not much production capacity has been added up 
as a reserve force to be utilized in the time to come, leaving 
negative effects on the growth tempo of the coming years. 
  '... Certain achievements have been recorded in the cultural 
and social fields, but here, many major and urgent problems 
remain unsolved. 
  'Total or partial unemployment in both urban and rural 
areas, 
especially among young people coming of labour age, remains 
aburning question and one of the basic causes of social evils. 
  'The policies related to social equity have not been 
properly 
implemented. Beside people who get rich by lawful means, there 
are not a few who have got rich quickly through illicit 
businesses. Meanwhile, many families who made great sacrifices 
and suffered great losses duging the wars of resistance, or who 
rendered great services to the motherland, are still beleaguered 
with difficulties. The number of persons living in poverty and 
food shortage is still high. The people's living standards are 
still very low in many areas, especially on the highlands, in 
out-of-the-way places, and localities inhabited by ethnic 
minorities... 
  'In the political situation, there remain many complicated 
factors not to be slighted. 
  'The party and state agencies and offices are not yet really 
pure and steady. Political security is still indequate and 
social order yet to be secured'... 
  Part ii on the main tasks for the coming period, the report 
points out: 
  'Our people are faced with acute challenges as well as great 
opportunities. 
  'The challenges are: the danger of our economy falling 
further behind other countries in the region and the world due 
to our low starting point, our still low and unstable growth 
rate and to the fact that we have to develop in an environment 
of tough competition the possibility of our going astray from 
the socialist orientation if we fail to correct errors in the 
conduct of the implementation and our failure to repel 
corruption and other social evils the scheme and acts of 
'peaceful evolution' by hostile forces. 
  'However, we also have many fundamental advantages: our 
party 
has set out a correct line, is of one mind and united our people 
are diligent, intelligent and patriotic, possessed of a firm 
character and a staunch revolutionary will, and confident in the 
party leadership, the armed forces are absolutely loyal to our 
party's and people's revolutionary cause, our successes in the 
cause of renewal are giving the country a new posture and 
strength to more forward the development of the scientific and 
technological revolution and the tendency toward broad 
cooperation for development in the world and the region are 
providing us with possible additional resources of 
importance...[as received] 
  Following are the main tasks: 
  'To encourage the economic restructuring along the line of 
industrialization and modernization... 
  'To consistently effect policies for the development of a 
multisector economy, create more motivations and favourable 
environment for the economic sectors and businesses of all forms 
to make fast development and achieve high efficiency... 
  'To build synchronously the market mechanism under state 
management and with socialist orientation... 
  'To care for cultural and social matters: the guiding idea 
threading through the party and state decisions and policies in 
the cultural and social fields is to care for, foster and 
promote the human factor as both motive and objective of the 
revolution. Outstanding problems in this work now are 
employment, social justice, improvement of the people's 
intellectual level, making the society wholesome and preserving 
and promoting the national cultural identity... 
  ...'Fighting against corruption is a burning and pressing 
problem at present. It must be carried out in a resolved and 
thorough manner throughout the apparatus at all levels and in 
all branches from the centre to the grassroots... 
  ...'To ensure national defence and security. 
  'To continve broademisg external relations'. 
  We will broaden relations of friendship and cooperation with 
other countries on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, 
peaceful co-esistence, respect for each other's independence, 
sovereignty and territorial integrity, settling disputes by 
negotiations, and maintaining stability, security and 
development... 
  'To build a law-governed Vietnamese state of the people, by 
the people and for the people... And...'To renew and streamline 
the party, consolidate the relationship between the party and 
the people...'.

  [Text] Hanoi, Jan 21 (AFP) -- Dissident Vietnamese monk Vo 
Hanh Duc has been sentenced to three years prison for having 
disturbed public order last year, the Buddhist opposition in 
exile said Friday. 
  A tribunal in the southern province of Ba Ria-Vung Tau 
handed 
down the sentence earlier this month following his arrest last 
July, the exiled sources said. 
  The Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam based in the 
Australian capital Canberra said in a statement received here 
that another monk Thien Tho was sentenced to 18 months house 
arrest. 
  Two other monks, Dong Hai and Dong Hy, were allowed to go 
free but remain under police watch, it said. 
  No official in Hanoi could confirm the report. 
  "The hearing was held in secret on January 5 in an army 
establishment," the statement from the exiles said. "The local 
press were barred." 
  Vo Hanh Duc, 48, and abbot of Son Linh pagoda since 1983, 
was 
arrested last July for having "conducted activities against the 
law" and "handing out documents hostile to the socialist 
government of Vietnam," according to the charges. 
  The abbot began a hunger strike several weeks ago while in 
prison and his health is deteriorating, the statement from the 
exiles said. 
  According to Buddhist sources, about 100 monks and their 
supporters were arrested during violent confrontations with 
security forces on July 9 when a crowd challenged the eviction 
of the abbot from his pagoda. 
  Most of those arrested were released recently, the sources 
said. 
  In other incidents, of four monks accused of provoking 
dissent last May in the central city of Hue, two were sentenced 
to four years jail and the other pair to three years. 
  Five civilians classed as agitators for joining an 
anti-government demonstration last May in Hue received sentences 
ranging from six months to two years.

  [Text] On the occasion of 45th founding anniversary of the 
Lao People's Army [LPA] (20 January 1949-94), General Doan Khue, 
minister of National Defense, sent a greeting message to Senior 
Lieutenant General Choummali Sai-ngason, defense minister of the 
Lao People's Democratic Republic. The message reads: 
  Dear comrade minister; on the occasion of the 45th founding 
anniversary of the LPA, on behalf of all cadres and combatants 
of the Vietnam People's Army and on my behalf, I would like to 
convey to you, and through you to all the cadres and combatants 
of the fraternal LPA, my most sincere greetings of solidarity. 
  Throughout the last 45 years, under the leadership of the 
Lao 
People's Revolutionary Party [LPRP], the LPA and the multiethnic 
Lao people have bravely advanced through all difficulties and 
obstacles, continously defeated all the invading imperialists as 
well as the domestic reactionaries, achieved glorious victories, 
and restored independence and freedom to the fatherland. 
  After the complete liberation of the country, the Lao armed 
forces still went on to crush all the dark schemes and sabotage 
activities of the enemies. In the past 20 year, the Lao 
People's Democratic Republic have recorded important 
achievements in all areas of national security, politics, and 
external relations, and in the socioeconomic domain. Domestic 
stability is constantly improving, the country's status on the 
international stage is being heightened, thus contributing to 
the protection of peace and stability in Southeast Asia as well 
as in the world. 
  We are happy for your achievements, and strongly trust that 
the Lao people and the LPA will continue to record ever greater 
achievements, successfully implement the resolution of the Fifth 
Congress of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, and build a 
peaceful, independent, unified, and prosperous Laos. 
  Also on this occasion, on behalf of the Vietnam People's 
Army, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the LPRP, 
the government, the people, and the LPA, for the fine sentiments 
and valuable assistance they had given to the Vietnamese people 
and the people's army during the past revolution as well as in 
the present rennovation undertaking. 
  May the special friendly solidarity and the comprehensive 
cooperation between the two peoples and the two armies of 
Vietnam and Laos be evermore solidified and developed. I wish 
you, comrade minister, good health and happiness in your life, 
and more achievements in fulfilling your noble duties. 
  My solemn salute to you, dear comrade.

  [Text] Last year party development work was carried out 
fairly well nationwide. According to incomplete reports, party 
organizations admitted nearly 50,000 new members, 30 percent 
more than the 1992 figure. 
  Among the departments under the Central Committee, the Army 
party organizations had the most new members admitted. The 
number of young people joining the party who had been members of 
the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Federation was also 
significantly large, comprising about 50 percent of the total. 
The number of new members with high levels of education was 
also large, and the numbers of women and ethnic minorities also 
were higher than before.

  [Text] To satisfactorily carry out the socioeconomic 
development tasks -- particularly in the areas of industry, 
commerce, tourism, and agriculture -- set forth by the capital, 
Hanoi, for the next remaining two years under its 5-year plan, 
the Hanoi banking sector has held a conference to review its 
reform activities over the past three years. 
  In attendence were Comrade Pham The Duyet, member of the 
Political Bureau and secretary of the Hanoi Municipal Party 
Committee; Comrade Cao Sy Kiem, member of the party Central 
Committee and governor of the Vietnam State Bank; and 
representatives of over 30 banks now operating in Hanoi. 
  By using various means of mobilizing capital in 1993, the 
banks in Hanoi acquired a total capital which was 39.7 percent 
of the country's total. The total amount of money they had lent 
out as of the end of 1993 amounted to 13,878 billion dong, 
accounting for 58.3 percent of the country's total loans and 
representing a 10-fold increase over those in 1991 and 1992. 
Banks in Hanoi have expanded their credit operations in various 
economic components. In particular, their medium- and long-term 
loans offered to various business firms to carry out technical 
innovation during 1993 increased 13 fold over 1992. The cash 
shortage situation is over. Formerly, it took eight days to 
resolve a banking transaction, but now it takes only one day. 
Banks have made active contributions to the economic growth of 
Hanoi.

  [Text] Sydney, Jan. 20 KYODO -- The North Korean 
Government wants to restore diplomatic relations with Australia 
which would end a 19-year-old severance of ties, acting Foreign 
Affairs Minister Gordan Bilney confirmed Thursday [20 January]. 
  North Korean and senior Australian officials have held 
secret 
talks at Australian Embassies in Jakarta and Bangkok, and the 
federal government has informed the United States, Japan and 
South Korea. 
  "But those talks have really essentially been about whether 
we should talk," Bilney said. 
  No decisions have been made about formal dialogue, which 
would be contingent upon three conditions, the Department of 
Foreign Affairs said in a statement. 
  Satisfactory progress must be made in the implementation of 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] safeguards and 
Australia "strongly supports" the U.S. negotiating stance on the 
nuclear issue, the statement said. 
  Australia would never play a "solo role" in putting 
relations 
with Korea at a normal footing and so progress would also be 
necessary in North Korea's relations with South Korea and the 
United States, it said. 
  Australia would also respect a call from North Korea's three 
adversaries not to reestablish ties. 
  Restoring ties relies strongly on whether North Korea will 
comply with U.S. pressure to allow international inspectors into 
its nuclear facilities. 
  Australia reportedly wants North Korea to rejoin the world 
community's economic and political affairs and would therefore 
be sympathetic to Pyongyang's reported proposal. 
  "North Korea... [ellipses as received] is an isolated 
country, and one can only speculate that perhaps it's feeling 
that isolation more now," Bilney said. 
  The Australian Government has considered inviting a senior 
North Korean Government official to visit Australia later in the 
year to initiate a stronger dialogue between the two countries. 
  While the step was entirely unsolicited, there were a number 
of possible reasons why Australia was approached, including the 
close relations with North Korea's main adversaries, the U.S., 
Japan and South Korea, the statement said. 
  Other reasons could include the fact that Australia 
currently 
chairs the IAEA Board of Governors and maintains a strong 
non-proliferation stance on nuclear weapons, the department 
said, adding that there have been sporadic contacts between 
Australia and North Korea in recent years. 
  Relations between Australia and North Korea were severed in 
1975 when the militant Communist government reacted to 
Australia's backing of South Korea in the United Nations by 
abandoning its embassy in Canberra and expelling Australian 
diplomats from Pyongyang.

relations can be resumed. 
  [Begin Bilney recording] There are a number of conditions 
which the North Koreans would have to meet before we move any 
further along this track, including, explicitly, adherence to 
IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] safeguards with (?at

governors, a resolution of the political [word indistinct] talks 
with the South Koreans, and progress in its relations with the 
United States. Those are three things. We are not acting alone. 
We are not going solo on any particular initiative with this

  [Text] North Korea's hardline communist regime is 
attempting to break the diplomatic ice with Australia, making an 
approach for the reestablishment of diplomatic links severed 
nearly 20 years ago. 
  Australia is encouraged by the approach, but it is insisting 
there be firm progress on the nuclear issue before ties could be 
resumed. Linda Mottram reports from Canberra: 
  [Begin Mottram recording] Australian officials have 
confirmed a report in the national newspaper THE AUSTRALIAN 
about the approach made in recent weeks by a senior North Korean 
diplomat to the Australian Embassy in Bangkok. An Australian 
Government spokesperson says Australian diplomats have returned 
the sounding-out. The spokesperson said the approach is being 
seen as encouraging, but says Pyongyang has been told any 
further development depends on North Korea allowing full 
international inspection of its nuclear facilities where nuclear 
weapons development is feared, and on progress in talks between 
North and South Korea and North Korea and the United States. 
  The spokesperson described the situation as talks about 
talks 
and very, very preliminary. Australia has informed South Korea 
of the approach which appeared to have been made to Australia 
only. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Washington-based correspondent Nam Chan-sun] </F>
  [Text] The BALTIMORE SUN of 15 January reported that the 
U.S. Defense Department has approved the sale to the ROK of a 
very defective electronic jamming system for F-16 fighters. 
  This electronic jamming system was jointly produced by the 
U.S. firm Westinghouse and ITT [expansion unknown]. However, 
its actual combat performance tested in 1992 failed to show 
satisfactory results, leading the U.S. Defense Department to 
cancel its contract to buy the system. 
  While noting that the F-16's which the ROK is set on 
purchasing are supposed to be equipped with this system, the 
BALTIMORE SUN did not specify the price or number of systems the 
ROK will purchase from the United States. 
  The paper said that the U.S. decision to sell this system to 
the ROK was noted in the letter which U.S. Deputy Secretary of 
Defense William Perry recently sent to the ROK defense minister. 
  The system was developed as a self-defense system to protect 
the fighter plane from a radar-guided arms attack of an enemy.

  [Text] Vienna, Jan. 20 (YONHAP) -- The International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has warned North Korea that it will 
not send a team of inspectors unless Pyongyang meets its 
inspection requirements at the seven declared nuclear sites. 
  In a fourth working-level meeting, the U.N. nuclear watchdog 
agency Wednesday urged North Korea to submit to all inspections 
as stipulated by the nuclear safeguards pact and explained why 
they are required. 
  After the meeting, IAEA Spokesman Hans Meyer said that 
although North Korea had agreed on many items of inspection that 
the IAEA had proposed in a meeting Monday, it still balked at a 
considerable number of items. 
  The IAEA told North Korea clearly that it would push through 
the items it refused to accept, he added. 
  In order for the inspections to be meaningful, North Korea 
has to meet the detailed and reasonable inspection requirements 
of the IAEA, he stressed. 
  The position of the IAEA is that unless North Korea agrees 
on 
all the inspections of its seven declared nuclear sites under 
the nuclear safeguards regime, the IAEA will not send an 
inspection team to North Korea, and this position has been 
clearly conveyed to Pyongyang, he said. 
  The IAEA hopes that North Korea will accept the inspections 
of its declared nuclear sites as requested, Meyer said. 
  Commenting on inspections of two undeclared sites in 
Yongbyon 
that are suspected of being nuclear waste processing facilities, 
he said access to these facilities for additional information 
would be dealt with separately. 
  The IAEA and North Korea will have another working-level 
meeting in Vienna next week, an IAEA source said. 
  North Korea has agreed, in principle, on inspections of its 
seven declared nuclear sites but refused to accept some 
inspection items at two problem sites, a radiochemical 
laboratory and a five-megawatt reactor, such as examination of 
chemical substances used there, other sources said.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan. 20 (YONHAP) -- North Korea is most 
unlikely to surrender its "nuclear card" in its endless 
tug-of-war with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
over nuclear inspection unless it is guaranteed diplomatic 
relations with the United States, eastern European and Western 
diplomats in Beijing said Wednesday. 
  There are some optimistic views in the capitals of South 
Korea, the United States and Japan that Pyongyang is approaching 
a limit in its diplomatic hide-and-seek over the nuclear 
problem, and may drop the nuclear card and instead try 
flexibility by announcing an open policy, which the diplomats 
said was "dangerous and utterly wishful thinking." 
  North Korea's acceptance in recent talks with the United 
States of international nuclear inspections is simply a tactical 
move to get the South Korea-U.S. "Team Spirit" military exercise 
suspended and therefore cannot be regarded as a basic change in 
attitude, they said. 
  Pyongyang is well aware that Washington will raise the 
question of human rights after the nuclear issue is settled, 
threatening a peaceful transfer of power from Kim Il-song to his 
son, Kim Chong-il. 
  With that in mind, the Stalinist regime will not bare all of 
its nuclear sites nor give up its nuclear program unless it is 
sure not only that it is out of danger of economic sanctions 
from the United States and the Team Spirit drill has been 
stopped, but also that it is guaranteed diplomatic normalization 
with Washington and Tokyo, recognition and support for its 
communist regime, and economic aid, they said. 
  Pyongyang, which displayed sophisticated diplomatic 
maneuvering with its surprise withdrawal from the nuclear 
Non-proliferation Treaty in March last year, is apparently well 
aware of the fact that Washington is worried North Korea's 
nuclear development might cause Seoul and Tokyo to go nuclear as 
well. The communist country seems to have decided that the 
United States may find it to be a hard work to apply military 
threats against it, the diplomats speculated. 
  A senior South Korean diplomat, agreeing with these views, 
said that North Korea will not give up its nuclear card unless 
it wins diplomatic recognition from Washington and a safety 
guarantee for its communist regime. 
  Beijing knows this, he said, and is limited in its ability 
to 
persuade Pyongyang. 
  If the prerequisites are not met, North Korea is unlikely to 
change to an open policy as many expect and the current 
situation shows that the leadership is in no hurry to resolve 
the nuclear issue and prepare for openness, he said. 
  An eastern European diplomat said that a friend in Pyongyang 
had told him that North Korea is weighing whether to pursue 
peace or wage war over the nuclear problem, and that some 
citizens and soldiers are prepared to fight the perceived enemy.

  [Text] Today North Korea proposed in a telephone message 
that it would send a condolence team of the National Alliance 
for the Country's Reunification [Pomminnyon] to the bier of the 
late Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, but the government has decided not to 
accept it. 
  National Unification Board spokesman Kim Hyong-ki said in a 
commentary issued this afternoon that because Pomminnyon is 
defined as an organization benefiting the enemy in accordance 
with a final ruling made by the Supreme Court in 1992, and 
because of the aggravated situation between North and South 
Korea caused by the North Korean nuclear issue, North Korea's 
proposal would not be helpful to improving North-South relations 
at all. According to this judgment, the government has decided 
to refuse the proposal.

  [Text] On 13 January, the Democratic Party [DP] held a 
policy seminar at the hall of lawmakers. This seminar entitled 
"The Prospect for the North Korean Nuclear Issue and North-South 
Relations" was sponsored by the party policy committee. 
  In the seminar, lawmaker Pak Sil said that "because there is 
a possible breakthrough in the settlement of the nuclear issue 
as a result of North Korea's acceptance of the nuclear 
inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the 
government must allow businessmen to visit North Korea." 
  He predicted that "because this year is the year in which 
there is no election in South Korea, in which the Kim Yong-sam 
government can strengthen its power, and in which North Korea 
can consolidate the transfer of power from Kim Il-song to his 
son, it is possible for the North and South to create conditions 
for the North-South summit talks."

  [Text] Various observations on the current status of Kim 
Yong-sun, who has been known to have been a secretary in charge 
of North Korea's policy on South Korea, attract public interest. 
  On 10 January, some foreign sources reported that Kang 
Chu-il, first deputy director of the Reunification Front 
Department of the Workers Party of Korea, had been appointed 
secretary in charge of policy on the South and that Kim Yong-sun 
came to take charge of policy on the United States. 
  Prior to this, in the middle of November 1993, it was 
observed that "Kim Yong-sun had been ousted and had not yet been 
appointed to any position." In fact, Kim had not been engaged 
in any external activity until the time he met Australian 
nuclear expert Peter Heiz [as transliterated] in July 1993, thus 
making the observation convincing. 
  In early December of last year, however, when the sixth 
session of the Ninth Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea 
was held, it was confirmed that Kim had been eliminated from the 
list of candidate members of the Political Bureau of the party 
Central Committee but still remained as secretary in charge of 
policy on the South. This enabled people to reach a conclusion 
on the various observations on Kim's status. 
  However, a recent report by foreign sources that Kim has 
been 
appointed to the post in charge of U.S. policy has prompted 
various new observations. 
  First, the ROK's Board of National Unification has denied 
the 
report that Kim quit the post in charge of policy on the South. 
  An official concerned denied the report on Kang Chu-il's 
appointment as secretary in charge of South Korean policy, 
saying that "It is usual for a party secretary to be member of 
the party Central Committee. However, there has been no report 
that Kang has been appointed member or candidate member of the 
party Central Committee since 1980." Another official concerned 
pointed out, "North Korea has never appointed a director-level 
official to be secretary of the party." 
  Accordingly, observers say that the rumor on Kim's dismissal 
from the post in charge of South Korean policy has been created 
because Kang practically exercises authority in making policies 
on South Korea although Kim maintains his title as secretary in 
charge. This is persuasive. They say that they have actually 
observed signs of Kim's declining power since 1992. 
  According to a Board of National Unification official, a 
Japanese figure, who visited North Korea and met Kim at that 
time, told him that "Kim Yong-sun once promised me to arrange a 
meeting with Kim Chong-il and seemed very confident. In the 
recent meeting with me, however, he looked somewhat weak [daso 
himi ppajindutan]." 
  Also related to this is the fact that he, as a candidate 
member of the Political Bureau, was downgraded from ranking No. 
15 to No. 26 in the party hierarchy late last December. 
  In view of the fact that North Korea considers the 
improvement of relations with the United States to be an urgent 
question, however, it is possible that North Korea created the 
new post in charge of U.S. policy so as to assign Kim, who had 
played the role of a conduit with the United States, to a 
certain duty. Judging from this and the fact that Hwang 
Chang-yop has recently sent an invitation to lawmakers of the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan, analysts say that Hwang 
Chang-yop, as secretary in charge of international relations, is 
completely in charge of policy on Japan, and Kim Yong-sun, an 
authority on U.S. affairs, takes complete charge of policy on 
the United States, while Kang Chu-il takes charge of practical 
business on the South.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 20 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam's 
view of North Korea and unification seems little different from 
those of his predecessors, but he does have a stronger desire to 
improve inter-Korean relations than they did. 
  Kim clarified this view on Thursday, after a policy briefing 
from Unification Minister Yi Yong-tok. 
  In the current international situation, where every country 
is competing fiercely, the Korean people cannot survive unless 
they realize unification as soon as possible, he told Yi. 
  Kim instructed his minister to develop inter-Korean 
relations 
so that a South-North Korean commonwealth is established during 
his term in office, which ends in February 1998. 
  Although he is eager to see inter-Korean relations improved, 
he has one condition: Settlement of the North Korean nuclear 
problem. 
  "The government should solve the nuclear problem, which is 
blocking improvement of inter-Korean relations, this year 
without fail to revitalize inter-Korean reconciliation and 
cooperation," he told Yi. 
  Once the nuclear problem is solved, the government should 
push ahead with the promotion of mutual interests and 
improvement of relations, Kim said. 
  "First of all, the government should make a breakthrough in 
solving the nuclear problem through an exchange of special 
envoys, and then it should push ahead with exchange and 
cooperation with North Korea," he said. 
  Inter-Korean relations were cool last year because of the 
suspicions about North Korea's nuclear development program. 
  Kim told Yi that he was sure that North Korea had no choice 
but to change its policies soon, and said that the government 
should use the change as an opportunity to improve inter-Korean 
relations. 
  Since North Korea is in a very difficult situation at home 
and abroad, it cannot avoid changing its policies. When North 
Korea begins to show a willingness to solve the nuclear problem, 
the international situation surrounding the Korean peninsula 
will change rapidly, he said. 
  The government should use the change for a stable 
improvement 
in inter-Korean relations and, ultimately, to realize peaceful 
unification. 
  "For those goals, the National Unification Board should push 
ahead with diverse inter-Korean talks and North Korea policies," 
Kim said. 
  He reassured Yi that he will not seek absorption like in 
Germany, but warned him that the people should guard against 
sentimental theories of unification.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 20 (YONHAP) -- The Defense Ministry has 
decided to build up military preparedness as there is a strong 
possibility of North Korean provocation in 1994-95. 
  The ministry has also decided to push a future-oriented 
defense policy in anticipation of a unified Korea in the 21st 
century while designating "five large military reform tasks" to 
respond to President Kim Yong-sam's call for reform and the 
creation of a new Korea. 
  The decisions are outlined in the ministry's report on its 
programs for 1994, submitted Thursday by Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae to President Kim Yong-sam at a conference room of the 
Ministry. 
  Yi said that North Korea completed preparations for war in 
1993 and designated 1995 as the year for unification of the 
country. Therefore, if the nuclear issue runs into a dead-end in 
1994-95 or the Kim Il-song regime is threatened, North Korea 
could attempt a military provocation in order to find a way out. 
  Against tension being built up by North Korea in connection 
with the nuclear issue, Yi said, South Korea is maintaining 
standby measures in close coordination with the United States. 
  South Korea and the United States have a solid joint defense 
posture against any kind of North Korean armed provocation since 
the United States has worked out a new military strategy, Yi 
told the president. 
  Moreover, the ministry, taking possible security situations 
in the 21st century into consideration, is promoting equidistant 
and cooperative relations with China, Japan, and Russia, Yi said. 
  In addition, the ministry will try to reorganize and 
transform South Korea's military from a manpower-based force 
into a technology-intensive and quality force by strengthening 
military technological education, Yi said. 
  He said the ministry will continue to carry out reform while 
internationalizing and globalizing national defense policy. 
  After receiving the report, President Kim instructed 
ministry 
officials to effectively manage the nation's defense resources 
and train all military personnel so that they can ensure a 
scientific management of the military force in the future. 
  "In order to do this, the ministry should develop new 
personnel management and undertake a systematic training 
program," Kim said. 
  Kim also urged the ministry to continue self-cleansing 
efforts to be reborn as a new military and undertake mesures to 
keep "the transparency" of defense projects and their 
effectiveness. 
  Following the report, Kim had lunch with senior military 
officers. 
  The president noted some concern that public opinion is 
sharply critical of the military because of a number of 
irregularities exposed in recent months. 
  The military has impressed the public deeply with the 
selfless dedication and sacrifice it demonstrated in a couple of 
disasters -- the Asiana jetliner crash near Mokpo, South Cholla 
Province, and the sinking of the Sohae-ho ferry in the West Sea, 
off Kunsan. 
  The entire military should not be judged on the basis of a 
few irregularities committed by a very limited number of people, 
Kim said.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 20 (YONHAP) -- Deputy Prime Minister Yi 
Yong-tok said Thursday that he expects a turning point for 
improvement of inter-Korean relations this year. 
  He expected progress in inter-Korean dialogue, exchange and 
cooperation this year, although it depends on what North Korea 
does to solve its nuclear problem, Yi told President Kim 
Yong-sam in a briefing on New Year's programs of the National 
Unification Board (NUB). 
  Yi, who is also national unification minister, told Kim that 
the government will hold fast to its principles, including 
solution of the North Korean nuclear problem, before seeking 
practical progress in inter-Korean relations. 
  The government will actively seek to solve the problem of 
separated families through international organizations such as 
the United Nations and to discuss with the North sending a 
unified team to the Hiroshima Asian Games. 
  "If the government finds a breakthrough for solution of the 
North Korean nuclear problem, it will allow businessmen to visit 
North Korea and actively participate in North Korea's plan to 
develop the Najin-Sonbong region," he said. 
  "It is inevitable for North Korea to change its policy 
toward 
openness because Pyongyang has to find a way out of the crisis 
caused by economic difficulties, diplomatic isolation and 
people's skepticism about the North Korean system. 
  "North Korea will agree to inter-Korean dialogue in a bid to 
have access to the United States," he added. 
  Yi said that the NUB will improve its organization to play 
its role fully in controling and adjusting unification policy as 
well as working out a measure in preparation for an exchange of 
special envoys. 
  The board will give concrete shape to its three-stage 
unification plan this year, he said. 
  In the first stage of the plan (reconciliation and 
cooperation), the two Koreas implement the basic agreements and 
joint declaration for denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. 
  In the second stage, they organize a South-North 
confederation. 
  In the third stage, the nation is unified under a new 
constitution and general elections are held.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 21 (YONHAP) -- Anti-espionage operations 
in 1994 will focus on increasing the preparedness for immediate 
reaction to unconventional warfare, strengthening the total 
defense system and developing training programs for special 
forces. 
  This was decided at an anti-espionage operations meeting led 
by Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Yi Yang-ho at the Defense 
Ministry on Friday. Attending were representatives of the 
Defense and Home Ministries, the Agency for National Security 
Planning and related government agencies. 
  North Korea has designated 1995 the first year of its 
unification struggle, and has increased propaganda and agitation 
campaigns for its armed forces and people to prepare for war, Yi 
told the meeting. 
  "In the coming year, in particular, North Korea is expected 
to continue its nuclear development program for the maintenance 
of the socialist system, increase its war preparedness and step 
up its effort to create a revolutionary climate in South Korea 
under a strategy to unify the Korean peninsula under communism," 
he said. 
  A loose sense of national security is seen in some quarters 
of society where the possibility of North Korea provoking 
another war is regarded as an unfounded fear, he said. 
  He then stressed the need for the people, the government and 
the military to strengthen the total defense system and increase 
the preparedness for immediate response to provocations by North 
Korea.

  [Text] The submarines which Russia has sold to North Korea 
recently were confirmed to be decommissioned submarines without 
any strategic value. 
  A relevant Foreign Ministry official revealed that the 
Russian Government informed our government that the submarines 
that Russia recently sold to North Korea were decommissioned 
submarines from which weapons and equipment were all removed. 
Therefore, these submarines were sold in accordance with a 
commercial contract, not a contract for weapons supply, and this 
contract prescribed that the Russian side will inspect the work 
of dismantling the decommissioned submarines.

<F P=106> [Report by Kim Hung-sik] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, Jan. 20 (YONHAP) -- Are the submarines that 
Russia is selling to North Korea worth only their value as scrap 
iron? 
  Despite an official clarification by the Russian 
authorities, 
questions are being asked from many different angles. 
  A Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman told a news briefing on 
Thursday that the value of the "antiquated submarines" amounted 
only to that of "hunks of iron" and that the deal was made 
purely on a commercial level. 
  Similar deals are being made not only with North Korea but 
with other countries as well, the spokesman said. 
  "There is absolutely no military significance in the sale," 
he declared. 
  Russian Naval experts are scheduled to be present when North 
Korea dismantles the submarines, the spokesman said. There is 
also a clause in the contract that prohibits North Korea from 
using the submarines for military purposes. 
  In addition, the Russian naval authorities will remove 
engines and other "core parts" of the submarines before they are 
towed to North Korea, he said. 
  Questions persist, however, as no one can be sure the "core 
parts" will be removed as the spokesman said, or how thoroughly 
and effectively the Russian Naval experts will supervise the 
dismantling by the North Koreans, even if they actually are 
allowed to do so. 
  Moreover, there is the ultimate question: What if North 
Korea wants to use them militarily? 
  Many Western diplomats are skeptical that the Russian Naval 
authorities would remove core parts before the submarines' sale. 
  According to what is so far known, the Russian Far-East 
fleet 
will sell 11 or 12 submarines and many Western observers believe 
there is a strong possibility that some of the submarines will 
be handed to the North Koreans with most of their parts intact. 
  The Russian Far-East fleet and North Korea could work out 
secret deals so that three or four of the submarines could be 
sold without their parts removed, the observers say. There is 
no way of verifying this. 
  North Korea at present possesses 26 "Romeo" and "Whisky" 
class submarines but it cannot operate nearly half of them as 
Pyongyang cannot supply parts. Under the circumstances, 
suspicion arises that North Korea may be trying to use parts of 
newly purchased submarines for its existing fleet, they say. 
  Shibata Ariyoshi, an executive of the Japanese trading firm, 
Toen, which has served as middleman for the deal, contradicted 
the Russian claim and said all the parts were in the submarines. 
  So far, only one submarine has been delivered to North Korea 
and it is being dismantled at a shipyard in Najin, northwestern 
North Korea, just south of Vladivostok. 
  But it is not known whether Russian Naval experts are 
currently supervising the dismantling job. All that the 
Far-East fleet headquarters said was that its experts will be 
present at the dismantling work, but no details were disclosed. 
  South Korea, as well as Japan, is consequently particularly 
worried over this point, sources say. 
  The submarines that are being sold to North Korea are 
"Foxtrot" and "Golf II" class that are later models than the 
submarines North Korea currently possesses. Especially in the 
case of the "Golf II," the submarines carried SS-5 missiles 
until the late 1980s. 
  North Korea, which has deployed submarines for a long period 
of time, is said to have accumulated considerable submarine 
know-how. It could further acquire submarine technology in the 
process of dismantling the submarines, if it is indeed 
dismantling them. 
  Other than what the Foreign Ministry spokesman said, both 
North Korea and Russia, especially its naval authorities, are 
not saying anything at all about the sale of submarines to North 
Korea. 
  The Russian Far-East fleet headquarters had first contact 
with the Japanese trading firm Toen for the submarine sale in 
September 1993 and signed a formal contract in November with the 
Defense Ministry's approval. 
  One senior naval official said that the contract was signed 
by Russia and the Japanese firm. On paper, in other words, it 
is the Japanese company that is selling the submarines to North 
Korea. 
  But sources said Russia took this route to sell its 
submarines because it did not expose the deal and it wanted a 
guarantee of payment for them by the Japanese company. 
  North Korea, indeed, could be buying the submarines for 
scrap 
iron. Nevertheless, the purchase is causing international 
concern because it comes at a time when the world community is 
tense over the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  Commenting on the latest development involving North Korea, 
the Russia daily IZVESTYA said there is ample reason for South 
Korea and Japan to worry about the submarine sale.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 21 (YONHAP) -- Russia has made official 
its offer to repay a South Korean loan with military hardware 
and technology, Foreign Ministry officials said Friday. 
  The Ministry had received a list, very close to one sent 
last 
month by a private defense institute, of arms and equipment that 
it was willing to include in such a deal on Jan. 19, they said. 
  To make the offer formal, Deputy Premier Aleksandr Shokhin 
sent a signed letter with it, they said. 
  Talks are expected among Foreign, Defense and Finance 
Ministry officials to decide whether Russian arms are compatible 
with Korea's current weapons and to weigh the pluses of Moscow's 
proposal. 
  Seoul agreed on 3 billion U.S. dollars in aid to Moscow but 
delivered only 1.47 billion dollars and suspended the rest after 
the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
  When Shokhin was visiting the Taejon Expo last year, he 
suggested that his country pay back the loan in military goods.

  Accordingly, the government will decide on its position 
after 
discussion with ministries concerned, including the Ministries 
of Foreign, Defense, and Finance, in February. 
  On 21 January, a government official said, "The Russian 
Government recently sent official documents to the ROK proposing 
joint development and production of weapons." He added that, 
"The government is carefully reviewing the list of possible 
items sent by Russia for joint development." The Russian 
proposal, which was made on the level of ROK-Russian economic 
cooperation, says that Russia will provide the ROK with 25 
end-products, that the ROK may manufacture weapons with Russia's 
permission, and that the ROK and Russia jointly develop and 
produce weapons. Ultramodern weapons -- such as missiles, 
submarines, tanks, and fighter planes -- are included in the 
list of items proposed by Russia for joint development and 
supply. 
  According to the government official, the ROK Ambassador to 
Russia Kim Sok-kyu will return home soon for intensive 
discussions on this matter. 
  The position of the Foreign and Finance Ministries on this 
matter is that the ROK should at least consider the Russian 
proposal, while the Defense Ministry is saying that the ROK 
should consider the proposal cautiously, taking into 
consideration ROK-U.S. relations, supply of parts, and 
compatibility of equipment. 
  Russia proposed joint development and production of 
ultramodern weapons to the ROK through unofficial channels late 
last year.

Committee, who had been scheduled to visit China sometime this 
week, postponed the visit without a prior notice and that this

North Korea's External Economic Committee and asked why he 
postponed the visit and when he would visit. However, the North 
Korean has not made a reply. 
  Kim was scheduled to visit China and discuss the

  [Text] According to a Chinese source on 20 January, China 
has given North Korea at least 7.5 billion won a year in 
military aid, even after the reduction of its aid to North Korea 
a few years ago. 
  This source, well versed in North Korean affairs, said that 
he "had recently heard this directly from a senior official of 
the Chinese Government," and said, "the details of the Chinese 
military aid to North Korea are not known. It has been learned, 
however, that the night infrared detection equipment is one of 
the items provided by China to North Korea." 
  The source also said that in addition to the military aid, 
China has annually provided North Korea with large-scale 
assistance of energy, including oil and coal; and of food 
including beans, corn, and rice, and that the annual food 
assistance reached about 15 billion won.

Korean delegation led by Hwang Chang-yop, a secretary of the 
Worker's Party Central Committee and chairman of the Supreme 
People's Assembly Foreign Affairs Committee, has spent the last 
three days in the special economic zone [SEZ] in Zhuhai, 
Guangdong Province, collecting information on Chinese economic 
reforms, a city official said Friday. 
  The North Koreans arrived in the southwestern port on 
Wednesday and spent the following day touring factories in an 
industrial complex. 
  Hwang expressed deep interest in industrial development in 
the area on meeting Zhuhai Party Committee Secretary and Mayor 
Liang Guangda, the Chinese official told YONHAP in a telephone 
interview. 
  The North Koreans left the city early Friday with material 
on 
economic reforms, the official said. 
  Beijing was trying to keep the visit secret in respect for 
Pyongyang's position. 
  "The three-day visit to Zhuhai is noteworthy because of the 
status of Hwang Chang-yop," a Western diplomat in Hong Kong 
said. "It is interesting to see North Korea so interested in 
Chinese-style economic reform."

  [Text] Following the sever of diplomatic relations 
between our country and Taiwan 17 months ago, Lin Tsun-hsien, 
representative of the Taiwan Mission in the ROK, arrived here on 
a Delta Airlines flight at 4:10 PM on 20 January. 
  In the news conference held at the airport, Representative 
Lin said: "I will do my best to restore mutual trust as soon as 
possible and to establish new relations based on the principle 
of equality and reciprocity." 
  Government officials, including Chong Yong-cho, a 
consultation officer in charge of Asian affairs at the Foreign 
Ministry, received the representative at the airport. Some 100 
resident-Chinese also warmly welcomed the representative and his 
wife by presenting garlands of flowers. 
  The representative said: "Although the two countries severed 
ties a year ago, I think it will not be long before the 
bilateral relations of frienship are restored since the two 
countries have maintained close cordial relations in culture and 
trade for a long time. I think, first of all, it is urgent to 
restore mutual understanding and trust." He then added: "It 
took longer than expected for me to arrive in the ROK because I 
had to pass on the ambassadorial duties of my former post. As 
soon as the construction of a new office at Kwanghwamun building 
is completed, the mission will be inaugurated and begin 
operations." 
  In connection with restoring relations in areas of economy 
and aviation, he said: "I believe that the bilateral relations 
in aviation, economy, and trade will soon be restored if the two 
countries and peoples are prepared to do so." 
  Representative Lin, saying that most Taiwanese people 
welcome 
the opening of the Taiwanese mission in the ROK, disclosed that 
he has met with Han Chol-chu, representative in the ROK mission 
in Taiwan, and that they had agreed to work closely with one 
another. 
  The major tasks of the mission will be protecting the rights 
of Chinese residents in the ROK and assisting Taiwanese students 
studying in the ROK, he said. 
  Following the break in diplomatic relations on August 24, 
1992, the ROK and Taiwanese Governments have since signed an 
agreement to establish relations in July last year and the ROK 
Mission in Taiwan began operations as soon as 25 November of 
last year.

  [Text] Hans Peter Steel, president of Germany's Federal 
Chamber of Commerce, 62, came to Seoul to have, as he put it, a 
first-hand look at the investment environment in the ROK. He 
came to Seoul on 12 January after winding up his visit to Japan. 
The reporter met him at the office of the ROK-German Chamber of 
Commerce in Seoul on 13 January. 
  [Ho Mun-myong] What is the purpose of your visit to the ROK? 
  [Steel] The German economy is export-oriented. But the 
settlement of the Uruguay Round made the German Government take 
even greater interest in international trade. The Asian region 
has a great growth potential and its investment environment is 
improving with each passing day. I have come to Seoul on behalf 
of the German industrialists to explore prospective business 
areas for investment and ways to promote economic cooperation. 
  [Ho] You said there has been a change in the investment 
environment in the ROK, did you not? 
  [Steel] Yes. Comparing it with that of one year ago when I 
visited Seoul, I find a considerable change not only in the 
external appearance of Seoul but in its economic environment, as 
well. Many of the restrictions have been lifted and the 
investment environment is changing positively. [end Steel] 
  President Steel said, "The ROK is trying hard to export its 
goods, but is blocking its domestic market from foreign 
exporters. A typical example is that the ROK is discouraging 
people from buying foreign-made cars while allowing them to be 
imported." 
  [Ho] Is there any problem in Germany's internationalization? 
  [Steel] Germany's exports and imports account for two-thirds 
of its gross national product. This explains how much we depend 
on trade with other countries. We have an urgent need to secure 
not only the European market but the East Asian and South 
American markets. Many German businesses are moving their 
plants to Southeast Asia and East Europe avoiding high 
production cost in Germany, therefore, this will activate our 
advance into these areas. 
  [Ho] Do you think this is a good time for the ROK to 
internationalize its economy? 
  [Steel] Yes, it is the right time for the ROK to do so 
because the ROK economy is now capable of sustaining itself to a 
certain degree. The ROK has liberalized much of its markets, 
but it has yet to open up more of them. 
  President Steel is the director of the Steel Company, the 
electric saw manufacturer that has 30 percent share of the 
entire world market, and was elected president of the German 
Federal Chamber of Commerce in 1988.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 19 (YONHAP) -- Gathering information on 
high-tech industries and new products in advanced countries for 
Korean industry to better compete in the world market is a 
foreign policy goal for 1994, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said

increased trade diplomacy to prepare the country for the new 
world trade order to be established by the projected world trade 
organization. 
  In addition, preparations for admission to the OECD 
(Organization of Economic Construction and Development) will be 
stepped up, along with efforts to increase cooperation with the

  [Text] Korea's automobile exports to North America, still 
its largest market, dropped sharply last year, while exports to 
other parts of the world except Africa surged, according to an 
analysis by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE). 
  Domestic automobile producers shipped 140,702 vehicles to 
North America last year, down 8.7 percent from 1992. 
  The fall was attributed to the shutdown of Hyundai Motor's 
plant in Quebec, Canada, a temporary sales vacuum caused by Kia 
Motors' export car model change, and Daewoo's separation with 
General Motors (GM), which put an end to exports of its LeMan 
model. 
  According to MOTIE officials, exports to North America will 
see growth this year but the growth rate will not be substantial. 
  As reasons, the officials cited the continued closure of 
Hyundai's Quebec plant, which is undergoing an overhaul of 
production lines, and the brake put on Daewoo's exports of the 
LeMans. 
  The Hyundai plant in Quebec was originally supposed to 
resume 
operations in September 1995 but a delay is expected because of 
problems concerning the planned equity capital increase by 
Hyundai for its Canadian subsidiary, according to the officials. 
  Following its separation with GM, Daewoo has been banned 
from 
shipping the LeMan model, which was developed by its former 
partner, to North America. 
  This year, Daewoo will produce the Legend model under a 
license agreement with Japan's Nissan. But this model is not 
likely to offset the vacuum caused by the ban on Daewoo's LeMans. 
  In contrast, Kia is expected to see a sharp increase in 
exports to the world's largest market. Starting from the second 
half of last year, it has been shipping the new Aspire model, 
instead of Festivas, to Ford under an OEM (original equipment 
manufacturing) agreement. 
  At the same time, it is building up its own sales network in 
North America to sell Sephias and Sportages under its own brand 
name. 
  According to MOTIE officials, Korean automakers are expected 
to suffer setbacks in exports to China this year as the 
neighboring country has strengthened control on imports of 
consumer products including foreign vehicles. 
  Last year, vehicle shipments from Korea to China are 
believed 
to have totaled over 50,000 units. This year, the figure is 
likely to be drastically slashed. 
  To other parts of the world, Korean car exports will enjoy 
continued growth. Overall, automobile shipments are expected to 
shoot up by 20 percent to around 800,000 units this year, 
according to MOTIE officials.

  [Text] The nation's top 30 business groups have selected 
their prime industries and companies which they will nurture as 
world-top enterprises in order to enhance their international 
competitiveness. 
  They submitted the lists of their choices to the Ministry of 
Trade, Industry and Energy yesterday, the government-set 
deadline. 
  The selection of core industrial sectors and companies by 
the 
30 largest conglomerates, which was conceived by the government 
last July, is aimed at business "specialization" as a means to 
strengthen the competitiveness of Korean products in 
international markets. 
  As permitted in the guideline, the top 10 of the 30 groups 
except for Kia chose three prime industries each, while Kia and 
the remaining 20 selected two core industries each. 
  The top 10 are Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo, Lucky-Goldstar, 
Sunkyong, Hanjin, Ssangyong, Kia, Hanhwa and Lotte. 
  Specifically, Hyundai decided on electronics, automobiles 
and 
energy; Samsung electronics, machinery and petrochemicals; 
Daewoo machinery, automobiles and distribution; Lucky-Goldstar 
electronics, petrochemicals and energy, and Sunkyong energy, 
petrochemicals and distribution. 
  Hanjin chose machinery, distribution and construction; 
Ssangyong energy, non-metals and automobiles; Kia automobiles 
and steel; Hanhwa energy, petrochemicals and distribution, and 
Lotte food &amp; beverages, petrochemicals and distribution. 
  The 20 other groups are Kumho, Daelim, Doosan, Dong-Ah, 
Hanjin, Hyosung, Dongkuk Steel, Sammi, Halla, Tongyang, Kolon, 
Jinro, Dongbu, Kohap, Kukdong, Woosung, Haitai, Byucksan, Miwon 
and Samyang. 
  Kumho selected petrochemicals and distribution; Daelim 
construction and non-metals; Doosan food &amp; beverages and 
construction; Dong-Ah construction and distribution; Hanil 
textiles, and construction; Hyosung petrochemicals and 
electronics, Dongkuk Steel distribution and steel; Sammi 
distribution and steel; Halla automobiles and machinery, and 
Tongyang electronics and distribution. 
  Kolon picked petrochemicals and distribution; Jinro food 
&amp; 
beverages and distribution; Dongbu steel and distribution; Kohap 
petrochemicals and distribution; Kukdong construction and non- 
metals; Woosung construction and distribution; Haitai food &amp; 
beverages and distribution; Byucksan non-metals and 
construction; Miwon food &amp; beverages and petrochemicals, and 
Samyang food &amp; beverages and petrochemicals. 
  The 30 top business groups were implicitly permitted to pick 
one or two core companies in each selected prime industrial line 
although there is no regulation on that matter in the guideline. 
  Of the 10 largest conglomerates, Hyundai picked five 
including Hyundai Electronics and Hyundai Motor; Samsung five 
including Samsung Electronics and Samsung General Chemicals; 
Daewoo four including Daewoo Shipbuilding &amp; Heavy Machinery 
and 
Daewoo Motor; Lucky-Goldstar six including Goldstar and Lucky, 
and Sunkyong six including Yukong and Sunkyong. 
  Selected core industrial lines will be free of the 
government's strict control on borrowing fresh bank loans by the 
top 30 business groups.

  [Text] The United States and the EC have agreed on the 
need to hold a quadrilateral ministerial meeting. In this 
connection, the Japanese Government stated that it "has not been 
informed of it officially. However, if such a request is made, 
the government intends to refuse it. While the United States 
and the EC have demanded that contents of the agreement on 
market access issues under GATT's multilateral trade 
negotiations (Uruguay Round), which was concluded at the end of 
last year, be improved, Japan has stated that it is "impossible 
to bring up things on which an agreement was already reached for 
negotiations once again" (according to the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI]). However, the 
situation remains fluid because, with the Japan-U.S. summit 
talks near at hand, the United States is expected to strongly 
demand that a quadrilateral meeting be held. 
  The issue of holding a quadrilateral meeting cropped up when 
President Clinton, who is now visiting Europe, met with EC 
Commission President Delors and other officials. During 
discussion on trade issues, the two leaders agreed that the 
United States and the EC should cooperate in urging Japan to 
further open its markets. In response, U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor and EC Commissioner Leon Brittan (in charge of 
external economic affairs) have agreed that consultations should 
be held at the quadrilateral meeting in an effort to further 
improve market access conditions on which an agreement was 
reached under the Uruguay Round talks. 
  It is expected that the United States and the EC will demand 
that Japan further lower or abolish its tariffs on timber, 
copper, distilled liquor, and other products. The tariff issue 
concerning these products was concluded at a quadrilateral 
meeting held in Geneva at the end of last year, and the final 
agreement was reached under the Uruguay Round. In the 
negotiating process under the Uruguay Round, while the United 
States and the EC demanded the withdrawal of tariffs on such 
products as timber, Japan refused their demand. It is said 
that, "even after the Uruguay Round conclusion, "the U.S. and 
European industrial circles are exerting pressure on their 
governments, (according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
[MFA]). 
  Japan has stressed its view that "because negotiating 
countries, including the United States, have reached an 
agreement on the Uruguay Round in a package, it is inappropriate 
to renegotiate on a part of the agreement," (as stated by the 
MFA). Some government officials have pointed out that "since 
Japan also wants to make some demands such as that the United 
States and the EC abolish tariffs on electronics products, no 
conclusion will be reached if a quadrilateral meeting is held," 
(according to a senior MITI official). However, because it 
seems that the United States and the EC are trying to encircle 
Japan with the two leaders playing a leading role, this is a 
source of concern for the Japanese Government officials.

<F P=106> [Speech by Khamtai Siphandon, chairman of the Lao People's </F>
Revolutionary Party Central Committee and prime minister of the 
Lao People's Democratic Republic, delivered at a mass rally held 
at the National Assembly Hall in Vientiane to mark the 45th 
founding anniversary of the Lao People's Army -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Beloved comrades and friends, 
45 years ago on 20 January 1949, in response to the aspirations 
and the call of our national liberation cause, the Latsavong 
unit was established under the direct leadership and command of 
beloved and respected President Kaysone Phomvihan. That date was 
the day of the merging of all scattered armed units set up in 
all regions throughout the country into the Lao Itsala Army. The 
event marked a major stage of growth and development for the 
revolution. [passage omitted] 
  On the occasion of the historic founding anniversary of the 
LPA, we would like to express our overwhelming affection and 
gratitude toward the beloved and respected President Kaysone 
Phomvihan for having organized, educated, maintained, and 
provided leadership to our Army, thus enabling it to grow 
stronger and bigger, into the state it is in now. 
  Beloved comrades and friends, looking back over the past 45 
years, we can assume that the historic achievements and 
victories of our Armed Forces have been accomplished thanks to 
the correct and clear-sighted leadership of the LPRP. The party 
has consistently organized, guided, and educated our Army. Our 
party has creatively charted an overall military course for our 
Army in conformity with the conditions in each period. It has 
adopted a correct fighting strategy and a wise policy for the 
Army. It has skillfully employed and combined various effective 
forms of fighting together. Our party knows how to further 
enhance all potentials in the country and to closely combine 
them with the strength of the epoch. It has established a combat 
alliance with the fraternal Vietnamese Army and people and has 
solicited support and assistance from many friends and 
progressive forces throughout the world, thus winning glorious 
victories for our revolution. [passage omitted] 
  In recognition of the great achievements and virtues of our 
Armed Forces, the party and state have decided to confer the 
National Gold Order, which is the most honorable medal of our 
nation, on the LPA for the second time on the occasion of its 
45th founding anniversary. [Applause] [passage omitted] 
  On the occasion of the anniversary of this historic day, 
once 
again, on behalf of the party and state as well as the Lao Armed 
Forces and people, I would like to express our profound 
gratitude to all friendly and fraternal countries for rendering 
effective and great assistance to the Lao Armed Forces and 
people and actively contributing to their national liberation 
struggle [in the past] and the tasks of national defense and 
development at present. [Applause] 
  The multiethnic Lao people will always remember and are 
grateful to the Vietnamese cadres, volunteer combatants, and 
specialists and other internationalist combatants for making 
sacrifices to the Lao revolution. The virtuous deeds of these 
comrades will be recorded in the annals of the Lao nation 
forever. [Applause] 
  Comrades and friends, our nation is firmly marching forward 
toward its destination by carrying out comprehensive 
restructuring. On the path of our advancement, we are blessed 
with numerous opportunities and favorable conditions. 
Nonetheless, we have also encountered numerous difficulties and 
trials. At present, even though a trend toward peace, stability, 
cooperation, and development is emerging, the situation still 
remains complicated and confused. 
  Under these circumstances, our party and government must 
continue adhering to and pursuing a foreign policy of peace, 
independence, friendship, and cooperation, aimed at maintaining 
and further developing normal relations with all countries 
throughout the world -- and with neighboring countries first -- 
on the basis of respect for each other's independence, 
sovereignty, and territorial integrity, noninterference in each 
other's internal affairs, equality, mutual benefits, and 
peaceful coexistence. We will continue, together with other 
peoples of the world, making contributions to the cause of peace 
and development. 
  To create favorable conditions for national development, we 
must make and concentrate all efforts on safeguarding our 
national security, stability, and tranquility. This is the duty 
which must be firmly grasped and entered into by everyone with a 
sense of responsibility. First of all, all party and 
administrative committees, organizations and services from the 
center down to all localities must increase their sense of 
responsibility toward the tasks of national defense and public 
security maintenance work, linking them with all spheres of work 
and closely associating them with the socioeconomic development 
of our country. At the same time, we must pay attention to 
assisting and building the Armed Forces into a more powerful and 
effective force for defending and preserving forever the 
revolutionary fruits reaped with great sacrifices by our people. 
  The party and command committees at all levels must make 
efforts to educate and train cadres and combatants in the Armed 
Forces to continue multiplying and increasing the glorious 
traditions of the LPA and our nation and enhance the tradition 
of patriotism and their faith toward the country and party; to 
actively study and firmly grasp the party's restructuring policy 
and the state's policies and laws and to act as a model in 
implementing them; and to heighten a sense of vigilance and to 
stand ready to thwart all sinister designs of the enemies, 
thereby securely safeguarding the country's independence, 
sovereignty, and territorial integrity and firmly ensuring its 
stability and tranquility. Efforts must be made to consolidate 
and strengthen the Armed Forces by raising their quality as a 
primary objective so as to gradually make them into a well- 
organized, strong, and modern revolutionary army. 
  In the immediate future, efforts must be made to raise the 
level of their capabilities in leading, commanding, and 
maintaining combat preparedness; to encourage them to engage in 
studies to raise the level of their culture and specialized 
knowledge; to engage in training in both the tactical and 
strategic fields; to increase unity between cadres and 
combatants; to constantly improve the relations between the 
Armed Forces and people; to closely look after the party; to 
heighten a sense of self-dependence and self-building; and to 
act as a model in working diligently and living frugally. At the 
same time, we must enhance their actual roles and capabilities 
in making contributions to the socioeconomic development of the 
country, for example in the agricultural field, in building the 
economic and cultural infrastructure, and in providing public 
services. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 21 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
answered a question put by KCNA today regarding the on-going 
negotiations between the DPRK and the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] in Vienna. 
  Negotiations on the continuity of safeguards are now going 
on 
between an official of the DPRK Embassy in Austria and an 
official of the Secretariat of the IAEA. 
  The negotiations were arranged according to an agreement 
between the DPRK and the United States. 
  As already reported, at the DPRK-U.S. contact held in New 
York toward the end of last year, the U.S. side officially 
manifested its will to suspend the Team Spirit joint military 
maneuvers, a test nuclear war, as part of the measures for 
removing nuclear threat to the DPRK, and we decided to accept 
inspection for the continuity of safeguards in conformity with 
our special position after the temporary suspension of the 
effectuation of our withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation Treaty 
[NPT]. 
  What we decided to allow is not routine or ad hoc inspection 
pursuant to the obligation under the NPT, but inspection merely 
for the continuity of safeguards conforming to our special 
position. 
  We proposed a scope of inspection enough to guarantee the 
continuity of safeguards at the current negotiations with the 
IAEA. 
  The IAEA should show an affirmative response to defining the 
scope of inspection commensurate with the guarantee of the 
continuity of safeguards at the negotiations, as agreed between 
the DPRK and the USA. 
  As we have already declared, the issue of routine and ad hoc 
inspection under the safeguards agreement shall be resolved 
smoothly, if the third round of the DPRK-USA talks are held and 
an agreement is reached on the package solution. 
  Therefore, there will be no ground for the IAEA Secretariat 
to refuse to respond to our reasonable proposal, if it is 
interested in the solution of the nuclear issue and the 
guarantee of the continuity of safeguards on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  We make it clear that, if the continuity of the safeguards 
fails to be guaranteed due to the absurd assertion of the IAEA 
Secretariat, we cannot be held responsible for it and the 
responsibility lies with the opposite side which complicated the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon insisted 
yesterday that Thailand supports the Malaysian-promoted East 
Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC) because the organisation will 
improve cooperation in the region. 
  Mr Uthai earlier met Malaysia's International Trade and 
Industry Minister, Dato' Seri Rafidah Aziz. 
  He said Dato' Rafidah wanted him to make clear the Thai 
Government's view on the EAEC. He told her he supported the 
move because it was a good concept. However, it was merely an 
initiative with no action taken yet. 
  At the weekend, officials who asked not to be identified 
said 
that Thailand was still not enthusiastic about the EAEC. 
  Mr Uthai said he stressed with Dato' Rafidah that the most 
important aspect was to strengthen the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations (ASEAN) to increase the group's bargaining power 
in international forums such as the Asia Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) group. 
  Under current understandings, the EAEC would comprise East 
Asian members of APEC and not the United States, Canada, Mexico 
or Chile. In November, senior ASEAN secretariat officials said 
their initial exploratory talks with potential members received 
a warm response. 
  Mr Uthai said Dato' Rafidah asked him whether Thailand would 
participate in the first meeting of APEC in Hawaii on March 18 
and 19 because she believed the United States would force 
smaller countries to open up their financial markets further. 
  Mr Uthai said he told Dato' Rafidah that he could not speak 
on behalf of the Thai finance minister but he thought that 
Thailand would have a clearer position after Tharin Nimmanhemin 
met the US Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. 
  Dato' Rafidah said the ASEAN secretary-general had visited 
countries which would be founders of the EAEC, such as Japan, 
South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Results would soon be 
reported to ASEAN economic ministers. 
  She said the private sector would benefit from the loose 
consultative forum. 
  The arrangement would benefit the private sector in finance, 
industry and even by linking the stock markets. 
  Dato' Rafidah said the private sector should realise the 
marketing possibilities as the EAEC would include Japan, South 
Korea, Taiwan, China, Indochina and all of ASEAN.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 20 KYODO -- A top Foreign Ministry 
official expressed discontent Thursday [20 January] with U.S. 
criticism against Japanese bureaucrats over framework trade 
talks. 
  The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, called the 
criticism "improper." 
  The two countries agreed to promote the trade talks on 
schedule in line with a bilateral accord, the official said. 
  "Criticism against counterparts in negotiations will serve 
only as a negative factor in talks," he said. 
  Senior White House officials expressed Tuesday frustration 
about the stalemated discussions and indicated that the United 
States has given up hopes of getting a deal through negotiations 
with Japanese Government bureaucrats. 
  Bowman Cutter, the White House official in charge of 
overseeing the bilateral talks, said it is time to move them 
beyond the confines of the bureaucracy, saying "sooner or later 
there has to be the capability to deal with people with 
political responsibility."

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 21 (YONHAP) -- South Korea is prepared 
for the possibility that North Korea will improve its relations 
not only with South Korea but also with Western nations when its 
nuclear issue is solved. 
  If the nuclear problem is settled, inter-Korean relations 
will rapidly improve and at the same time North Korea's 
relations with Western nations will make considerable 
improvement, unification minister Yi Yong-tok told the Advisory 
Council on Democratic and Peaceful Unification on Friday. 
  The government has a set of measures to prepare for such a 
possibility, he said. 
  "North Korea will guardedly seek to open its doors on a 
limited scale so that the open-door policy doesn't stand in the 
way of maintaining its political system," he said. "And I think 
the North Korean nuclear issue will be solved in a manner 
desirable to us, though the timing is a question." 
  He stressed the need for a positive posture toward North 
Korea. 
  "We must now slough off the negative and passive view of 
North Korea we held in the past and take a positive posture 
toward desirable change in North Korea." 
  He warned against inter-Korean dialogue for dialogue's sake 
or for show. 
  "We must now strive to hold a dialogue that will be of 
substantial help to solving the problem."

  [Text] In following the agreement of the Uruguay Round of 
talks and the trend toward deregulation, the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI] plans to drastically 
ease export controls on textile products. Within this year, the 
ministry will remove legal cartels on two categories of 
products, thus lifting ceilings on exports to the United States. 
In addition, the export permit system requiring exporters to 
get permits for exports will be abolished except for limited 
items exported to the United States and the European Union (EU). 
  Japan's textile products have lost their competitiveness in 
face of other Asian nations' export offensives, and thus the 
meaning of numerical controls has diminished. The measure also 
has the purpose of reducing the textile industry's burdens by 
simplifying export procedures. 
  The products, cartels on which will no longer be legally 
accepted, are secondary textile products like woolen fabric 
goods and cotton trousers. The legal cartel system has been in 
effect more than 20 years, and during that period MITI has set 
export ceilings each year, while the Export Cooperatives have 
checked export quantities and contract terms. 
  Controls on two categories of products, exports of cotton 
fabric goods to Canada and fishing nets and synthetic fiber 
products to Canada and three other countries, were removed from 
the legal cartel system at the end of last year. With the 
additional two categories of products to the United States being 
removed from the system, only three categories of products will 
be left to benefit from the legal carteling. 
  Meanwhile, the export permit system which will be abolished 
in principle at the end of this year will apply mostly to 
textile goods. The ministry is thinking about excluding East 
Europe and the Middle East from the permit system by the end of 
March, ahead of other countries. 
  Exporters' papers related to obtaining permits take the 
ministry about two days per case to review, entailing much work 
for the ministry officials concerned. By 1995, regulations left 
on exports to the United States will be only those aimed at 
curbing exports to the United States through a third party, plus 
those governing legal carteling. The number of permit 
application papers reviewed will fall from about 310,000 at 
present to 50,000 cases in the future. 
  According to MITI, by the series of deregulation measures to 
be effected this time, the products whose export quantities 
remain under control will drop from 95 to 28 percent in export 
value as far as exports to the United States are concerned. 
  The Multinational Fiber Agreement (MFA), which sets the 
rules 
for international dealings on textile products, will be absorbed 
into the GATT's rules over a period of 10 years after the 
Uruguay Round agreement goes into effect. The Uruguay Round 
agreement regards self-controls on exports as being "gray-area 
measures" and prohibits them. This means remaining regulations 
will be abolished sooner or later.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Shigeru Komago] </F>
  [Text] The Japanese Government has been trying to cultivate 
contacts with Robert E. Rubin, an assistant to President 
Clinton. Mr. Rubin, who is in charge of the National Economic 
Council (NEC), plays a key role in coordinating economic policy 
as a confidant of President Clinton. The Japanese Government 
appears to have concluded that to break the stalemate in 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, it is more effective to 
make direct contacts with the assistant than with U.S. trade 
officials who are anxious to score points at the talks. Despite 
his flexible attitude toward setting numerical targets, Mr. 
Rubin is making a tough demand that Japan make "efforts 
commensurate with an economic power," and the Japanese 
Government should not pin rosy hopes on him. 
  The Japanese Government has been exploring contacts with Mr. 
Rubin through senior officials of major ministries who have 
recently visited Washington because the Japan-U.S economic 
framework talks remain stalled after government officials from 
the two countries have failed to smooth over their confrontation 
over the principle of setting numerical targets. 
  The confrontation between the U.S. Trade Representative and 
the Japanese side is not likely to be addressed. At bilateral 
negotiations on the insurance sector, the U.S. Trade 
Representative, which has made the tough demand that Japan allow 
foreigners to attend the Insurance Deliberation Council and 
present the United States with a draft amendment to the 
Insurance Business Law, continues to stick by his demand. As 
for the improvement of institutions on the part of the United 
States, the U.S. side has refused to discuss it, claiming, "This 
is not subject to bilateral negotiations." On the other hand, 
U.S. Government officials, especially U.S. Trade Representative 
Kantor, have hinting at sanctions against Japan, which differs 
from White House and the State Department statements that the 
"United States will not link the Japan-U.S. economic framework 
talks to sanctions." The Japanese Government has good reason to 
count on Mr. Rubin, who is known as a leading troubleshooter, 
rather than listen to Mr. Kantor's proposal for cabinet-level 
consultations. 
  Mr. Rubin earned a high reputation as a troubleshooter while 
successfully keeping the confrontation between the White House 
and the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) over monetary policy from 
spiraling out of control by using his economic sense fostered on 
Wall Street and his personal ties. 
  It is a big mistake, however, to take his attitude as "soft 
with Japan." At a NEC meeting, he said: "Our goal is to have 
Japan fulfill it promises to rebuild Japan's economy into an 
economy driven by domestic demand and cut its current account 
surplus." He then instructed each government agency to work to 
achieve that goal. He has spearheaded the U.S. demand that Japan 
present the United States with measures to stimulate the economy 
and open the market. It is highly possible that if Japan tries 
to cultivate contacts with Mr. Rubin simply as a negotiating 
tactic without making a decision on the measures, it will get a 
strong punch from the U.S. Trade Representative.

  [Text] U.S. Commerce Under Secretary Garten, who is now 
visiting Japan to attend the vice ministerial-level Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks, held a meeting with Yutaka Kume, 
chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association 
[JAMA] Inc., (and chairman of the Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.) on 13 
January. During the meeting, in touching on the deadlocked 
government-level negotiations on the issue of Japan's purchase 
of U.S.-made auto parts, he asked Kume to come up with a "mid- 
to long-term purchase expansion" plan. At the same time, he 
urged that in an effort to increase sales of U.S.-made autos in 
Japan, Japan should open its automobile dealers' sales network 
to U.S.-made autos. 
  In response, JAMA Chairman Kume firmly rejected Under 
Secretary Garten's call for expanding the purchase of U.S-made 
auto parts in the mid- to long-term by saying: "This call means 
asking us to set numerical targets for future purchases. 
Therefore, we cannot make any promise." In this way, Kume 
clearly indicated a stand of firmly rejecting any requests that 
lead to the setting of numerical targets. With regard to 
Garten's call for opening auto dealers' sales network to 
U.S.-made autos, Kume said: "That is not something in which we, 
auto manufacturers, should interfere." 
  Under Secretary Garten also met with Mitsubishi Motors 
Corporation President Yuichi Nakamura and asked him to increase 
Japan's purchase of U.S.-made auto parts. In reply, President 
Nakamura, in referring to the Japanese auto industry's goal of 
increasing the total amount of its purchases of U.S.-made auto 
parts to $19 billion in fiscal year 1994, said: "Because of a 
drastic change in the economic environment, it is difficult to 
attain our goal ($1.6 billion). Given such a situation, it is 
impossible to set a numerical target for fiscal year 1995 and 
after that."

<F P=106> [Article by correspondent Shigeru Komago: "The Bureaucracy </F>
-- Japan-U.S. Economic Framework Talks Face Rough Sailing and 
Debates on Tax Cuts Remain Stalled"] 
  [Text] The criticism of Japanese bureaucrats is growing 
among senior U.S. Government officials. With Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks facing rough sailing and debates on 
deregulation and income tax reductions in Japan stalled, U.S. 
Government officials are increasingly taking the view that 
"Japanese bureaucrats are standing in the way of changes for 
Japan." U.S. Government officials are taking this view because 
Japan's politics are unable to display leadership and Japanese 
bureaucrats are increasingly taking an inward-looking attitude, 
asserting that "Japan must say what it needs to say and it must 
protect what it needs to protect." Under these circumstances, 
there is no sign in sight for breaking the stalemate in the 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. 
  The criticism by Japanese bureaucrats is roughly classified 
into two categories. First, the Japanese bureaucrats are 
standing in the way of rebuilding Japan's economic structure, 
which has been sought by the United States. The U.S. side 
explained: "We have drawn that conclusion after reviewing the 
results of a series of discussions by deliberation and research 
councils of the Japanese Government." The Provisional Council 
for the Promotion of Administrative Reform has been deluged with 
a flurry of deregulation requests from the private sector, but 
many of the council members only lamented: "We have been unable 
to brush aside the resistance of government ministries and 
agencies." Late last year, the United States expected the 
Economic Reform Research Council (the Hiraiwa Commission) to 
make a recommendation that Japan set a target on its own to cut 
its current account surplus, but the recommendation has 
disappeared. 
  Every day the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo translates a huge volume 
of Japanese newspapers to send to Washington. The embassy has 
also used its own channels to gather information about 
discussions by the deliberation and research councils from 
sources close to the prime minister and other sources. 
  There is a strong indication that the White House, the State 
Department, and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) have 
lobbied the Hiraiwa Commission to draw conclusions favorable to 
the United States. Last December, one American under 
secretary-level official after another visited Japan for the 
sole purpose of "collecting the information." 
  The National Economic Council (NEC), the supreme 
decisionmaking body for U.S. economic policy, at a recent 
working-level meeting, concluded that: "All conclusion drawn by 
the deliberation and research councils were far from meeting our 
expectations because of resistance from the bureaucracy." 
Bowman Cutter, deputy assistant to President Clinton said: 
"Japanese bureaucrats are giving more priority to the interests 
of their respective ministries than to the prime minister's 
intentions." 
  Many U.S. Government officials think that Japanese 
bureaucrats are whipping up anti-America sentiment. In 
particular, the U.S. side was surprised to find that: "Officials 
in charge of past external negotiations in the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI] and the International 
Finance Bureau of the Finance Ministry are now in the forefront 
of criticism against the United States after abruptly turning 
inward. 
  A U.S. Government official, who does not hide his 
irritation, 
said: "The Japanese bureaucracy appears to have a "policy 
consensus" of never making concessions to the protectionist 
Clinton administration." 
  Several Japanese Government authorities have admitted the 
existence of the policy consensus. Last September, Japanese 
negotiators decided to uphold the principle of "making no 
concessions to any U.S. trade demand which may lead to setting 
numerical targets." Recently, Jiro Saito, Finance Ministry 
administrative vice minister, and Hideaki Kumano, MITI 
administrative vice minister, agreed not to hastily seek a 
compromise with the U.S. side to settle bilateral negotiations 
on insurance, automobile, and auto parts in February." 
  "Ending the era when Japan is changed by external pressure" 
is a password of the Japanese bureaucrats. At the same time, 
however, they cannot ignore the consequences of their password 
-- a toughened U.S. attitude toward Japan and a vicious cycle in 
the two countries' relations. 
  There is a large difference between Japanese and U.S. 
bureaucrats. In the United States, the President appoints all 
senior government officials, known as political appointees, and 
they are tasked with policy coordination. Mr. Cutter stated: 
"Their work is to carry out the President's intentions." There 
is a decisive difference between the United States and Japan in 
the personnel affairs management of senior government officials. 
In Japan, the prime minister has no personal ties with them, 
with some exceptions. 
  American senior government officials, who share the same 
fate 
as the President, are now moving toward changes. The Clinton 
administration has announced its plan, worked out by those 
senior government officials, to cut 100,0000 federal government 
employees. The Japanese bureaucracy, which does not change even 
when a change in government occurs, is suitable for the 
continuity of policies but unsuitable for changes. 
  There is no denying the Japanese bureaucracy has problems 
which draw criticism from the United States. American 
bureaucracy is too often pushed around by the President and 
Congress and this is a defective aspect of American bureaucracy. 
At Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, differences have 
existed between departments in charge of the talks and American 
officials in charge of the talks on U.S. demands. There have 
also been differences between them over U.S. sanctions against 
Japan, causing the Japanese side to distrust the U.S. side. 
  Another cause for stalling bilateral negotiations, that 
seemingly contradicts U.S. criticism of the Japanese 
bureaucracy, is excessively high expectations by the United 
States for a good performance by the Japanese bureaucracy. 
American bureaucrats appear to have an "opportunist trend" in 
which they first pin high expectations to the performance, and 
if their expectations are not met, they then attack the Japanese 
bureaucracy. 
  From the start of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, 
the United States has pinned high hopes on the "leadership" of 
bureaucrats in MITI and the Finance Ministry. The United States 
still sticks to its demand for setting numerical targets to open 
the Japanese market wider after concluding that it is quick to 
use the conventional bureaucrat-led formula to get trade 
results. As for stimulus measures, some U.S. Government 
officials even said: "It is best to negotiate directly with 
Administrative Vice Minister Saito." 
  This, however, is a miscalculation on the part of the United 
States. MITI's influence on businesses has waned compared with 
the influence it exercised in the past. What is growing in the 
entire bureaucratic world is an introspective mood. 
  The voice is heard both in Japan and the United States: "No 
matter how many times the two countries hold working-level 
economic framework talks under this situation, they will only 
find it difficult to break the stalemate." While the United 
States is waging a campaign aimed at criticizing the Japanese 
bureaucracy, American Embassy staffers familiar with Japanese 
political circles are frequently contacting aides to Prime 
Minister Hosokawa. As a result, the United States appears to be 
using a tactic aimed at going over the heads of bureaucrats to 
seek political settlement. 
  This U.S. tactic is aimed at gaining the same agreement as 
an 
ambiguous agreement reached between former Prime Minister 
Miyazawa and President Clinton last July that "set an objective 
criteria in both quantitative and qualitative terms," leaving 
its definition unclear. If the Japan-U.S. economic framework 
talks are to produce some agreements before Japan-U.S. summit 
talks scheduled for February, the United States may use the same 
tactic to seek an "ambiguous political settlement" which, like 
the July agreement, will leave something less than desirable. 
Behind Japan-U.S. trade friction are differences between the 
bureaucrats of Japan and the United States.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan and the United States Should Stop Going </F>
Round in Circles and Start Constructive Discussions"] 
  [Text] No progress whatsoever has been achieved in the 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks no matter how many times 
meetings have been held. The Clinton administration of the 
United States wants to introduce numerical targets, but Japan 
argues that this would lead to managed trade. Japan offers 
counterarguments but does not come up with anything to break the 
deadlock. It seems that both sides have been bogged down right 
at the beginning of the talks. If such a confrontation 
persists, there will be chaos in the post-cold war world 
economy. Now is the time to transcend such theoretical debate 
of free trade or managed trade, and get right on to more 
constructive discussions from a global viewpoint. 
  Japan and the United States are supposed to reach agreement 
in the areas of automobiles and auto parts, insurance, and 
government procurement before the Japan-U.S. summit meeting on 
11 February. Yet, U.S. negotiators claim that the talks "have 
not moved one inch forward" (according to Under Secretary of 
Commerce Jeffrey Garten). Japanese negotiators also admit that 
both sides are merely repeating the points they have made at the 
beginning. Have the two countries come to a dead end? 
  The perception gap between Japan and the United States seems 
to be growing all the time. The Clinton administration is 
apparently under the impression that "Japan, Inc.," with 
politicians, bureaucrats, and businesses all cooperating 
closely, still exists and functions. This can be seen from the 
U.S. attempt to set an import target for automobiles and auto 
parts, and rely on the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry's administrative guidance [gyosei shido] to make the 
automobile industry comply. However, in Japan today, the 
validity of administrative guidance itself is being questioned. 
If the Clinton administration's demand is accommodated, this 
will run counter to the Hosokawa administration's policy of 
reforming the economic system into a more transparent one. 
  On the other hand, since the Clinton administration came to 
power, there has been a stronger tie between the U.S. Government 
and the businesses. It seems that a "United States, Inc." is 
being created through the government's industrial policy. Under 
the new administration, a reversal in economic systems in Japan 
and the United States is taking place. 
<H5>  "Mistaken Notions" and "Overconfidence" </H5>
  Just as the Clinton administration holds on to its mistaken 
notions, the Hosokawa administration clings to its amae. Japan 
is facing its worst economic recession in the postwar years. It 
also has to deal with political reform. Moreover, Prime 
Minister Hosokawa's personal relationship with President Clinton 
is good. It seems that the Hosokawa administration has the 
easygoing notion that even if it is not able to work on 
negotiations with the United States amid the difficult domestic 
situation, the United States would understand. 
  However, the Clinton administration is trying to add 
momentum 
to its foreign economic strategy. After enacting the North 
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and concluding the GATT 
multilateral trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round), it is now 
focusing on results in the Japan-U.S. framework talks. 
  Another factor in the growing perception gap between the two 
countries is that, since the end of the cold war, the Western 
countries have lost the impelling reason to unite under the free 
economy ideology, and short-term economic interests of 
individual countries have come into serious conflict. Compared 
to the Japan-U.S. Structural Impediments Initiative talks, the 
framework talks have evidently been a venue for much greater 
assertiveness on both sides. 
  This in itself is a sign that the negotiations are being 
conducted in the Western style. The problems is: While 
negotiations between the United States and the European 
countries, no matter how intense they may become, are still 
conducted with the tacit understanding that this is a game in a 
ring of shared values, the United Staes feels that negotiating 
with Japan is an entirely alien game. At this point, 
Kasumigaseki [the bureaucracy] is beginning to get tough, 
asserting "if there should be a breakdown in the negotiations, 
this cannot be helped." Behind this is the overconfident 
assumption that Japan-U.S. relations have matured to a degree 
comparable to U.S.-European relations. 
  Negotiators on both side also have to take some of the 
responsibility. We are disappointed that Under Secretary of the 
Treasury Lawrence H. Summers and Under Secretary of State Joan 
E. Spero, who have been quite popular among the Japanese 
economic circles as believers in free trade, insisted on setting 
numerical targets. The U.S. trade strategy, the idea of 
numerical targets, is being opposed by all major U.S. 
economists, including Professor William R. Cline, Nobel Prize 
winner for economics. Numerical targets are undoubtedly 
incompatible with the economists' theories. 
  The defensive stance on the part of Japanese officials, 
which 
irritates U.S. negotiators so much, is also at fault. While 
Japanese officials in charge of economic affairs are 
sufficiently trained to argue back at their negotiating 
partners, they have not thought about the serious consequences a 
deadlock in the negotiations may bring on post-cold war 
Japan-U.S. relations as a whole. 
  First, negotiators on both sides should go back to the 
agreement made between Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and 
President Clinton in July 1993. While some say this was an 
11th-hour compromise made during the last days of the Liberal 
Democratic Party regime, it has to be respected, in any case, 
because an agreement is an agreement. That agreement says that 
Japan should aim at "fully meaningful" reduction of its current 
accounts surplus, and set certain "objective criteria" to gauge 
market opening in specific sectors. 
  With regard to "objective criteria," the United States 
demands that the share of foreign products in the Japanese 
market should be comparable to their share in the other G-7 
nations. It claims that this is not a target, but a basis for 
gauging the openness of the market. However, Japan, from its 
bitter experience with the Japan- U.S. semiconductor agreement, 
where market share percentages became the numerical target, 
remains suspicious. It continues to resist the setting of any 
criteria that may lead to numerical targets. 
<H5>  Global Perspective Needed </H5>
  This is not a time for Japan to just keep on saying "no." If 
it thinks U.S. demands will lead to managed trade, it has to 
come up with concrete proposals to open the market which will 
not lead to managed trade. Now is the time to use our heads to 
come up not only with counterarguments, but also 
counterproposals. 
  We also hope that the United States will modify its stance 
of 
being preoccupied with numbers. It should not be impatient to 
see immediate "results," but should seek more long-term results. 
It is also important that U.S. demands should be in line with 
efforts to make the Japanese economic system more transparent, 
and more open. The U.S. attempt to take advantage of Japanese 
administrative guidance in the automobile sector, and its demand 
in the insurance sector which virtually goes against the trend 
of liberalization are quite illogical. 
  It is also questionable that the Clinton administration 
should allude to the revival of the Super 301 provision in 
connection with the framework talks. This runs counter to the 
agreement reached at the Uruguay Round to do away with 
unilateral trade measures. 
  What is important for both Japan and the United States is to 
see things from the perspective of how the G-2 (Japan and the 
United States) should rehabilitate the post-cold war world 
economy. In a global economy where national boundaries do not 
exist for goods, money, and information, there is growing 
interdependence between companies of various nations, while, 
similarly, conficts tend to be more acute. There can be no 
stability in the world economy as long as the Japanese and U.S. 
Governments continue their confrontation. Japan and the United 
States have to transcend bilateralism to jointly manage the new 
post-Uruguay Round world economic system. 
  This is not a time for confrontation and talking round in 
circles. It is high time to reconstruct a globally oriented 
Japan- U.S. relationship.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Hiroaki Ito] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 17 Jan -- One of the reasons for the 
rough sailing of the Japanese-U.S. framework trade talks is the 
tough attitude taken by the United States. Washington expects 
the Hosokawa government to display a positive attitude, unlike 
past Japanese Governments, in the talks. This "excessive 
expectation" has led to an aggressive attitude by U.S. 
negotiators in the talks. Also, because of its weak political 
basis at home, the Clinton administration "cannot retreat from 
its tough stand" in the talks. 
  Last November, a senior USTR [U.S. Trade Representative] 
official said, "We do not need to hurry because there will be 
more negotiations on 11 February," indicating the trade talks 
would be concluded during the summit talks between Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
This suggests that the U.S. Government, which gives high marks 
to Prime Minister Hosokawa, places more hope on "a decision to 
be made by Hosokawa" than on negotiations with Japanese 
bureaucrats. 
  However, even after welcoming in the new year, the Hosokawa 
government remains stymied by the "political reform" problem. 
The administration is unable to lead bureaucrats in the trade 
talks. Instead, it has recently made remarks in favor of 
bureaucrats' opinions. 
  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor recently expressed 
dissatisfaction with Japan, saying: "The United States has made 
efforts to fulfill Japan's requests for reducing financial 
deficits and realizing low interest rates. Meanwhile, Japan has 
made little effort to open its markets to foreign competition." 
The United States is irritated because things have turned out 
contrary to its expectations. 
  As in Japan, the political base of the ruling party 
supporting the Clinton government is weak. Some tough elements 
in the U.S. auto industry are now saying: "Do not conclude the 
trade talks if the two sides reach an agreement without setting 
numerical targets." 
  Washington has not changed its view that the Hosokawa 
government is "better than past Japanese Governments which 
formed collusive ties with bureaucrats and corporations" 
(according to a senior Commerce Department official). Thus, 
when Washington criticizes Japan, it directs its criticism at 
bureaucrats, not Hosokawa. U.S. Under Secretary of State Wirth 
has suggested the summit talks between Clinton and Hosokawa 
could be held not only on 11 February but also in the evenings 
of 10 and 12 February. Washington seems to have concluded that 
at the final stage it will have no choice but to urge Hosokawa 
to make a decision.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Let Bosnia Fight Fair"] </F>
  [Text] Not long after Bosnia erupted into civil war 21 
months ago, the international community gambled that if it could 
fudge its commitment to peacekeeping long enough, the conflict 
would sooner or later fizzle out and be forgotten. It has not 
paid off; instead, with each passing day the stakes have 
increased to a point where the poverty of conscience is 
bordering on ennui. The impatience of the major powers in the 
shambolic [as published] Bosnian peacekeeping operation to 
consign the tragedy to remote memory has left them questioning 
themselves about how little they can get by with in dealing with 
the Bosnias of the future. With their default over Bosnia more 
or less a done deal, the NATO countries at their summit last 
week hastened to reassure themselves that the Atlantic alliance 
could still uphold lofty principle on elaborate pretense alone. 
  For while the post-Cold War world resolves its geopolitics 
in 
the absence of a clear definition of friend and foe, it is 
pretentious to assume that self-interest is anything less than 
paramount. Both France and Britain, the main participating 
nations in the Bosnian peacekeeping presence, have hinted that 
that interest would not be further served by exposing their 
troops in an inconclusive conflict. Those troops might be 
withdrawn if no agreement is reached by the spring -- it would 
be pointless to stay on when the injustice of the carve-up plan 
has been conceded as a given. The Bosnian Government cannot 
accept the residue of their country as offered so far, and have 
no choice but to keep on fighting. With its back against the 
wall, it had been prepared to yield up to two-thirds of its 
territory in return for a face-saving and economically viable 
peace. Between immolation and a humiliating vestige of their 
former sovereignty, the Bosnian Muslims are making the only 
dignified choice. Having stayed neutral on the terms of a peace 
settlement, the Europeans see no point in turning their token 
gestures into sitting ducks. 
  Apart from the extremist elements, the Bosnian Muslims know 
that they cannot win back all that they have lost. The realists 
hope to regain the bulk of central Bosnia and wrest by force the 
minimal concessions that they had thus far failed to obtain by 
negotiation. The greatest irony of the West's dereliction over 
the Bosnia issue is that the basis for their inaction has not 
come to bear -- the conflict did not end quickly. It is now 
safe to conjecture that had the arms embargo been lifted, the 
fighting would have taken less time to come to a truce, with an 
eventual deadlocked armistice. No matter how tense such an armed 
stand-off might have been, it would have been wrought at less 
suffering. Ethno-religious rivalry exacts greater attrition the 
longer it is left to fester. The sooner an impasse is reached 
with reasonable grounds staked out, the more amenable will the 
combatants be to a practical detente. 
  Such "what if's" will no doubt keep historians busy in time 
to come. What would make them busier still is the external and 
incidental costs of the international community's betrayal of 
principle. It is already obvious to most Muslims worldwide that 
their interests are incompatible with those of that community's 
Western leaders, vaunted principles notwithstanding. The scale 
of Bosnia's neglect might be small enough to be easily 
forgotten. But the religious sectarianism with which that 
conflict was fought will be remembered for a long time yet.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jan 21 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Malaysian 
Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamed has blamed the United Nations 
(UN) for the suffering of the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
ticking off the international body for what he described as not 
discharging duties entrusted to it. 
  In another of his strong speech criticising the 
international 
community over the plight of the Bosnians, the prime minister 
said UN had not only put its integrity in question but also the 
sincerity of the so-proclaimed champions of human rights. 
  At a function where he received a standing ovation from a 
group of Bosnians now taking shelter in Malaysia, he also 
expressed his sadness that the international community had 
chosen to stand by and watch the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
continued to face the merciless aggression of the Serbs. 
  If we accept what is happening to the Bosnians now as 
legitimate and right, then our civilisation is coming to an end, 
he said when launching the books Voices of Malaysia, Suara 
Keperihatinan Malaysia and Bosnia: Testament To War Crimes As 
Told By Survivors here Thursday. 
  At the ceremony, attended by corporate leaders, senior 
government officers and politicians, more than RM1 million 
[Malaysian currency] was collected for the Bosnian fund which Dr 
Mahathir said, proved that they were still humans, symphathising 
for the Bosnians. 
  In criticising the UN, Dr Mahathir said it was clear that it 
was the United Nations that was holding down the Bosnians with 
its policies of arms embargo over Bosnia-Herzegovina, over 
protecting the UN troops and failing to apply pressure against 
Serbia. 
  The embargo had left the Bosnian Muslims defenceless against 
the Serbs, he said, adding that it was apparent that the Western 
powers did not want their soldiers even to get hurt, and not to 
mentiom killed and that they did nothing to protect the Bosnians 
Muslims. 
  What good are they called soldiers. We might as well call 
the 
civilians or small children to do their jobs, he said. 
  Prominent social worker Dr Alijah Gordon, who edited the 
book 
Bosnia: Testament To War Crimes As Told By Survivors, criticised 
UNESCO for failing to protect priceless manuscripts in Sarajevo 
from being destroyed by the Serbs.

  [Excerpts] Seremban, Wed -- Former Sabah Foundation 
director Datuk Dr. Jeffrey Kitingan was today released without 
any conditions from restricted residence under the Internal 
Security Act [ISA]. 
  This was confirmed by Negri Sembilan police chief SAC 
[Senior 
Assistant Commissioner] 1 Abas Johar here. 
  Kitingan was released from the Kamunting detention camp on 
December 22 last year after being held there under the Internal 
Security Act since May 13,1991, and put under restricted 
residence in Seremban for a duration of not more than two years. 
Under the earlier restriction order, Kitingan was not allowed 
to write or help to write any article that is political in 
nature, hold gatherings in his house or compound or in any 
building under his control or make Press statements. 
  Kitingan, 45, collected his release letter after police 
officers escorted him from the Allson Klana Resort hotel to the 
police headquarters at 12.25pm [0425 GMT]. 
  He said he was very happy and thanked Prime Minister Datuk 
Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, who is also Home Minister, for 
releasing him unconditionally. 
  "I am very happy and I take this opportunity to thank Dr. 
Mahathir for releasing me without any conditions," he told 
reporters at the hotel lobby. 
  Kitingan said he hoped the Prime Minister would also release 
other Sabah people who were still under restricted residence. 
  He said he would leave for Sabah tomorrow morning. 
  Asked if he would contest a seat in the forthcoming Sabah 
State elections, he said, he would do so if he was named as a 
candidate. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kota Kinabalu, Jan 17 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- The High 
Court here Monday fined Chief Minister of the eastern Malaysian 
state Joseph Pairin Kitingan 1,800 ringgit (U.S. $660) in 
default six months' jail after finding him guilty of using his 
position to award a shophouse project in his constituency of 
Tambunan to a company in which his brothers-in-law had interests. 
  Justice Denis Ong Jiew Fook of the Miri High Court passed 
the 
sentence after hearing mitigation from Pairin's counsel, Raja 
Aziz Adruse, and a reply from senior federal counsel Abdul Gani 
Patail. 
  He took about an hour and 21 minutes to decide on the 
sentence which was greeted with loud applause from the public 
gallery. 
  The charge under Section (1) of the Emergency (Essential 
Cases) Ordinance 1970, carries a maximum fine of 20,000 ringgit 
or a jail term not exceeding 14 years, or both upon conviction. 
  Pairin, 53, was found guilty of using his position as the 
chief minister to commit a corrupt practice by approving a 
1.48-million ringgit contract for the Sabah Economic Development 
Corporation's shophouse project in Tambunan to Rimkaya Co. Ltd., 
in which his relatives were the directors-cum-shareholders. 
  He committed the offence at his office in the Sabah 
Foundation building in Likas here, on September 11, 1985. 
  During the trial, which lasted 96 days, the prosecution 
witnesses testified that Justin Alip and Jude Edward Kessy were 
Pairin's brothers-in-law and Rimkaya's 
directors-cum-shareholders. 
  Pairin, in his defence, said he was not aware that any of 
his 
brothers-in-law was involved with Rimkaya which was given the 
second phase of Tambunan shophouse contract. 
  He was defended by Anthony Scrivener, QC [Queen Counsel], 
Raja Aziz Addruse, Douglas Primus, Datuk Chau Chin Tang, and 
James Tsai, while Gani prosecuted, assisted by Ahmad Bache.

  [Excerpts] Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir says the government has 
no plans to appoint a new Sabah affairs minister to replace Tun 
Datu Mustapha, who resigned yesterday. The resignation of Tun 
Datu Mustapha as Sabah affairs minister, chairman of the UMNO 
[United Malays National Organization] Merudu Division, and 
consequently an UMNO member will not affect anyone. Tun Datu 
Mustapha had the right to make this decision. It showed, 
however, that Tun Datu Mustapaha was not committed to UMNO. 
[passage omitted] 
  Asked about Datuk Jeffrey Kitingan, director of the Sabah 
Foundation, who has cited the possibility of playing politics to 
revamp relations between the federal government and the Sabah 
Government, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said that the federal 
government has never quarreled with the people of Sabah. The 
federal government merely disagrees with the present Sabah 
leadership: 
  [Begin Mahathir recording] I have heard these rumors for a 
long time. Indeed, they want to be readmitted into the National 
Front. We cannot just readmit them, though. You remember that 
we admitted them after they insisted, but they quit the National 
Front easily at a time when we were facing a general election. 
Thus, we cannot readmit them easily. First, we want to know 
the extent and see the proof of their commitment. If they are 
able to prove that they really had nothing to do with their 
leader's action, we will consider readmitting them, because we 
are not extremely rigid; we have mercy for them. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Summary from poor reception] "A new era has been forged in 
economic cooperation between Malaysia and Indonesia. This 
follows the highly professional visit of Deputy Prime Minister 
Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim to Jakarta recently. A record 12 
memoranda of understanding were signed between both governments 
and respective private sectors." 
  The high-level business trip was intended to set up a joint 
venture company called Malindo. The joint venture will help 
identify small- and medium-scale industries in Indonesia. The 
venture is meaningful because it will promote closer ties 
between the private sector in the two countries. 
  "The partnership is all the more timely and vital in view of 
ASEAN's goal to form a single market early next century. 
Malaysia's trade and investment linkages will help the two 
countries to become growth centers within ASEAN." 
  Of course, as in any business venture, problems are bound to 
crop up. The challenge is to overcome these problems and work 
for mutual benefit. There will be many rewards, including for 
the two countries' markets. There are differences in the 
business relationship between the two countries, but more 
importantly there are great similarities. It is encouraging to 
see that a memorandum of understanding was signed to market the 
Proton in Indonesia. This is the national car's first entry 
into the protected Indonesian market. Indonesia should become 
involved in Malaysia's national car project by supplying auto 
components for the project. An Indonesian group and the 
manufacturer of the national car are already discussing this 
possibility. Two-way cooperation has also been extended to the 
financial sector. 
  "Malaysia has promised technical assistance in establishing 
Islamic financial and insurance system. There is much Malaysia 
can contribute in this area, as it has one of the most 
successful Islamic banking system in the world." 
  "It is also all important in a world that is increasingly 
becoming more competitive, and where developing countries seem 
to be always pushed around."

  [Excerpts] Kuala Lumpur, Wed -- The Cabinet has accepted 
Indonesia's offer of a new NAS-332 Super Puma helicopter to 
replace a similar aircraft used by the Royal Malaysian Air Force 
[RMAF] which crashed near Sungai Petani, Kedah, on December 31 
last year, killing the crew of four. 
  Defence Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak said the Cabinet 
at its weekly meeting today accepted the offer as it was a sign 
of goodwill from the Indonesian Government. [passage omitted] 
  "However, the RMAF will evaluate the technical aspects of 
the 
Super Puma and its after sales support before taking delivery of 
it," Najib said. 
  He said this to newsmen after receiving Brunei's Navy 
commander Colonel Pehin Datuk Paduka Kefli at his office in 
Jalan Padang Tembak. 
  Earlier, Pehin met Royal Malaysian Navy chief Laksamana 
Madya 
[Rear Admiral] Datuk Sri Shariff Ishak. [passage omitted] 
  On Pehin's visit, Najib offered to train more Brunei navy 
personnel here and build naval warships for them. [passage

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Wed -- The Royal Malaysian Air Force 
[RMAF] today received the first of its 10 British Aerospace 
[BAe] Hawk 100 twin-seater advanced jet-trainer aircraft from 
BAe Defence Military Aircraft Division in Warton, United Kingdom 
[UK]. 
  On hand to receive the aircraft from BAe Defence Military 
Aircraft Division director Kevin Smith was RMAF chief Lieutenant 
General Datuk Abdul Ghani Aziz. 
  The Warton factory will also supply 18 Hawk 200 single-seat 
ground attack aircraft to the RMAF. 
  The Government ordered the Hawks in December 1990, costing 
more than RM1.2 billion, including equipment training aids, 
spare parts and ground support equipment. 
  In his speech, Kevin said the delivery marked a significant 
milestone for BAe as Malaysia represented the first sale of the 
Hawk 100 and 200 series in ASEAN. 
  "We fully recognise that the successful introduction of the 
Hawk into service in Malaysia is of prime importance to both the 
RMAF and BAe," he said. 
  Excerpts of his speech was released in a statement issued by 
BAe here. 
  Abdul Ghani later toured the plant to view the other Hawks 
being assembled. 
  The Hawk 100 is equipped with high-technology avionics 
including a high performance laser initial navigation unit, new 
generation Head-Up Display/Weapon Aiming Computer (HUN/WAC) as 
well as high accuracy Air Data Sensor. 
  In addition, the aircraft is also equipped with a 
Forward-Looking Infra Rec (FLIR) and laser range finder which 
lets the pilot complete his mission day or night and in poor 
weather conditions. 
  The same system will help the pilot to deliver its weapons 
accurately. 
  The Hawk 100 is powered by the Rolls Royce 871 Adour engines 
with refinements to the wings to include a new combat flap 
setting. 
  The addition of such sophisticated equipment is not at the 
expense of the aircraft's proven reliability and maintainability. 
  The Hawk 200 is the only aircraft in its class to be fitted 
with a sophisticated Hughes AN/APG-66H multimode pulse doppler 
radar. 
  The improved cockpit has been designed to provide good 
all-round visibility and the pilot's workload in attack is 
reduced by the Hotas. 
  Ground support equipment and spares are being shipped from 
the UK to Malaysia and BAe field representatives are now in 
Malaysia to assist in their implementation. 
  BAe had also begun training RMAF technicians as of last June 
and pilot conversion training has been conducted since early 
this month. 
  The sale of the Hawks have generated participation of local 
aviation companies in co-manufacturing of parts and maintenance 
of the aircraft to off-set the cost of buying the aircraft. 
  Among them are SME [Expansion unknown] Technologies Sdn Bhd 
[Company Limited] which are involved in manufacturing weapons 
pylons and Airod Sdn Bhd for engine servicing and overhauling. 
  Apart from that, BAe is also involved in transferring 
on-board technology computer software to the RMAF.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur -- Foreign Minister Professor S. 
Jayakumar yesterday said that both Singapore and Malaysia should 
find ways of expanding contacts at all levels. 
  Speaking to THE SUNDAY TIMES before flying home after a 
two-day visit, he said that such a move was necessary because of 
the changed circumstances. 
  In the past, he said that many Malaysians and Singaporeans 
studied together at Raffles College and the University of Malaya 
in Singapore. 
  As this was no longer happening, he said that it was 
important for the two countries to make concerted attempts to 
build new links. 
  Prof. Jayakumar said that his Malaysian counterpart, Datuk 
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, whom he met on Friday also agreed on the 
need to step up contacts. 
  Both felt that bilateral ties were very good and that 
outstanding issues between the two countries could be resolved. 
  As an example, he said that they noted that discussions 
between both countries were being conducted on two issues on the 
same day as their meeting. 
  They were the disputes over the ownership of Pedra Branca, 
on 
which stands the Horsburgh Lighthouse and which Singapore has 
administered for the past 150 years, and the delineation of the 
Straits of Johor. 
  "We were both optimistic that such issues could be 
resolved," 
he said. 
  Datuk Abdullah, who was present to bid farewell to Prof. 
Jayakumar, interjected that the current approach was the best. 
"Leave it to the present mechanism," he added. 
  Prof. Jayakumar took the opportunity of stressing to his 
Malaysian counterpart the value he attached to the 
Singapore-Malaysia relationship. 
  "With good relations, it will be easier to view in 
perspective the occasional hiccup that may erupt from time to 
time," he added. 
  Prof. Jayakumar, who is also law minister, was on his first 
overseas trip since he took over the portfolio in a cabinet 
reshuffle earlier this month. 
  He said that his visit was in line with the tradition for a 
newly appointed minister to call on his ASEAN counterpart and to 
establish personal rapport. 
  Prof. Jayakumar, who first met his Malaysian counterpart 
about 10 years ago, said that he attached great importance to 
personal ties as they formed a vital ingredient in establishing 
a good working relationship. 
  Datuk Abdullah has accepted an invitation from his Singapore 
counterpart to visit the republic later this year. 
  Other Malaysian leaders whom Prof. Jayakumar met were Law 
Minister Datuk Syed Hamid Albar and Deputy Home Affairs Minister 
Datuk Megat Junid Megat Ayub.

or a jail term not exceeding 14 years, or both upon conviction. 
  Pairin, 53, was found guilty of using his position as the 
chief minister to commit a corrupt practice by approving a 
1.48-million ringgit contract for the Sabah Economic Development 
Corporation's shophouse project in Tambunan to Rimkaya Co. Ltd., 
in which his relatives were the directors-cum-shareholders. 
  He committed the offence at his office in the Sabah 
Foundation building in Likas here, on September 11, 1985. 
  During the trial, which lasted 96 days, the prosecution 
witnesses testified that Justin Alip and Jude Edward Kessy were 
Pairin's brothers-in-law and Rimkaya's 
directors-cum-shareholders. 
  Pairin, in his defence, said he was not aware that any of 
his 
brothers-in-law was involved with Rimkaya which was given the 
second phase of Tambunan shophouse contract. 
  He was defended by Anthony Scrivener, QC [Queen Counsel], 
Raja Aziz Addruse, Douglas Primus, Datuk Chau Chin Tang, and 
James Tsai, while Gani prosecuted, assisted by Ahmad Bache.

  [Excerpts] Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir says the government has 
no plans to appoint a new Sabah affairs minister to replace Tun 
Datu Mustapha, who resigned yesterday. The resignation of Tun 
Datu Mustapha as Sabah affairs minister, chairman of the UMNO 
[United Malays National Organization] Merudu Division, and 
consequently an UMNO member will not affect anyone. Tun Datu 
Mustapha had the right to make this decision. It showed, 
however, that Tun Datu Mustapaha was not committed to UMNO. 
[passage omitted] 
  Asked about Datuk Jeffrey Kitingan, director of the Sabah 
Foundation, who has cited the possibility of playing politics to 
revamp relations between the federal government and the Sabah 
Government, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said that the federal 
government has never quarreled with the people of Sabah. The 
federal government merely disagrees with the present Sabah 
leadership: 
  [Begin Mahathir recording] I have heard these rumors for a 
long time. Indeed, they want to be readmitted into the National 
Front. We cannot just readmit them, though. You remember that 
we admitted them after they insisted, but they quit the National 
Front easily at a time when we were facing a general election. 
Thus, we cannot readmit them easily. First, we want to know 
the extent and see the proof of their commitment. If they are 
able to prove that they really had nothing to do with their 
leader's action, we will consider readmitting them, because we 
are not extremely rigid; we have mercy for them. [end recording]

  [Summary from poor reception] "A new era has been forged in 
economic cooperation between Malaysia and Indonesia. This 
follows the highly professional visit of Deputy Prime Minister 
Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim to Jakarta recently. A record 12 
memoranda of understanding were signed between both governments 
and respective private sectors." 
  The high-level business trip was intended to set up a joint 
venture company called Malindo. The joint venture will help 
identify small- and medium-scale industries in Indonesia. The 
venture is meaningful because it will promote closer ties 
between the private sector in the two countries. 
  "The partnership is all the more timely and vital in view of 
ASEAN's goal to form a single market early next century. 
Malaysia's trade and investment linkages will help the two 
countries to become growth centers within ASEAN." 
  Of course, as in any business venture, problems are bound to 
crop up. The challenge is to overcome these problems and work 
for mutual benefit. There will be many rewards, including for 
the two countries' markets. There are differences in the 
business relationship between the two countries, but more 
importantly there are great similarities. It is encouraging to 
see that a memorandum of understanding was signed to market the 
Proton in Indonesia. This is the national car's first entry 
into the protected Indonesian market. Indonesia should become 
involved in Malaysia's national car project by supplying auto 
components for the project. An Indonesian group and the 
manufacturer of the national car are already discussing this 
possibility. Two-way cooperation has also been extended to the 
financial sector. 
  "Malaysia has promised technical assistance in establishing 
Islamic financial and insurance system. There is much Malaysia 
can contribute in this area, as it has one of the most 
successful Islamic banking system in the world." 
  "It is also all important in a world that is increasingly 
becoming more competitive, and where developing countries seem 
to be always pushed around."

  [Excerpts] Kuala Lumpur, Wed -- The Cabinet has accepted 
Indonesia's offer of a new NAS-332 Super Puma helicopter to 
replace a similar aircraft used by the Royal Malaysian Air Force 
[RMAF] which crashed near Sungai Petani, Kedah, on December 31 
last year, killing the crew of four. 
  Defence Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak said the Cabinet 
at its weekly meeting today accepted the offer as it was a sign 
of goodwill from the Indonesian Government. [passage omitted] 
  "However, the RMAF will evaluate the technical aspects of 
the 
Super Puma and its after sales support before taking delivery of 
it," Najib said. 
  He said this to newsmen after receiving Brunei's Navy 
commander Colonel Pehin Datuk Paduka Kefli at his office in 
Jalan Padang Tembak. 
  Earlier, Pehin met Royal Malaysian Navy chief Laksamana 
Madya 
[Rear Admiral] Datuk Sri Shariff Ishak. [passage omitted] 
  On Pehin's visit, Najib offered to train more Brunei navy 
personnel here and build naval warships for them. [passage

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Wed -- The Royal Malaysian Air Force 
[RMAF] today received the first of its 10 British Aerospace 
[BAe] Hawk 100 twin-seater advanced jet-trainer aircraft from 
BAe Defence Military Aircraft Division in Warton, United Kingdom 
[UK]. 
  On hand to receive the aircraft from BAe Defence Military 
Aircraft Division director Kevin Smith was RMAF chief Lieutenant 
General Datuk Abdul Ghani Aziz. 
  The Warton factory will also supply 18 Hawk 200 single-seat 
ground attack aircraft to the RMAF. 
  The Government ordered the Hawks in December 1990, costing 
more than RM1.2 billion, including equipment training aids, 
spare parts and ground support equipment. 
  In his speech, Kevin said the delivery marked a significant 
milestone for BAe as Malaysia represented the first sale of the 
Hawk 100 and 200 series in ASEAN. 
  "We fully recognise that the successful introduction of the 
Hawk into service in Malaysia is of prime importance to both the 
RMAF and BAe," he said. 
  Excerpts of his speech was released in a statement issued by 
BAe here. 
  Abdul Ghani later toured the plant to view the other Hawks 
being assembled. 
  The Hawk 100 is equipped with high-technology avionics 
including a high performance laser initial navigation unit, new 
generation Head-Up Display/Weapon Aiming Computer (HUN/WAC) as 
well as high accuracy Air Data Sensor. 
  In addition, the aircraft is also equipped with a 
Forward-Looking Infra Rec (FLIR) and laser range finder which 
lets the pilot complete his mission day or night and in poor 
weather conditions. 
  The same system will help the pilot to deliver its weapons 
accurately. 
  The Hawk 100 is powered by the Rolls Royce 871 Adour engines 
with refinements to the wings to include a new combat flap 
setting. 
  The addition of such sophisticated equipment is not at the 
expense of the aircraft's proven reliability and maintainability. 
  The Hawk 200 is the only aircraft in its class to be fitted 
with a sophisticated Hughes AN/APG-66H multimode pulse doppler 
radar. 
  The improved cockpit has been designed to provide good 
all-round visibility and the pilot's workload in attack is 
reduced by the Hotas. 
  Ground support equipment and spares are being shipped from 
the UK to Malaysia and BAe field representatives are now in 
Malaysia to assist in their implementation. 
  BAe had also begun training RMAF technicians as of last June 
and pilot conversion training has been conducted since early 
this month. 
  The sale of the Hawks have generated participation of local 
aviation companies in co-manufacturing of parts and maintenance 
of the aircraft to off-set the cost of buying the aircraft. 
  Among them are SME [Expansion unknown] Technologies Sdn Bhd 
[Company Limited] which are involved in manufacturing weapons 
pylons and Airod Sdn Bhd for engine servicing and overhauling. 
  Apart from that, BAe is also involved in transferring 
on-board technology computer software to the RMAF.

  [Excerpt] Kuala Lumpur, Jan 21 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Malaysia 
and France Thursday signed a memorandum of understanding on 
cooperation in telecommunications and postal services. 
  Energy, Telecommunications and Posts Minister S. Samy Vellu 
signed the agreement with visiting French Minister of Industry, 
Posts and Telecommunications Gerard Longuet after two days of 
discussions. 
  Malaysia will start the general services mobile (GSM), a new 
cellular phone, by next May and France will be one of the 
operators of GSM which will cooperate with us, Samy told 
reporters after the signing ceremony at his office, here. 
  He said Malaysia needed the cooperation of other GSM 
operators in Europe to follow the European telecommunications 
standard to maintain direct connections and the cooperation 
provided by France was in the usage of the software system. 
  We also discussed on the fibre optic network and they are 
interested to set up a fibre optic factory in Malaysia for the 
export market, he said. 
  Samy Vellu also said that Telekom Malaysia was discussing 
with a French telecommunications company, Alcatel, to buy 
telecommunication switching equipment. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur -- Foreign Minister Professor S. 
Jayakumar yesterday said that both Singapore and Malaysia should 
find ways of expanding contacts at all levels. 
  Speaking to THE SUNDAY TIMES before flying home after a 
two-day visit, he said that such a move was necessary because of 
the changed circumstances. 
  In the past, he said that many Malaysians and Singaporeans 
studied together at Raffles College and the University of Malaya 
in Singapore. 
  As this was no longer happening, he said that it was 
important for the two countries to make concerted attempts to 
build new links. 
  Prof. Jayakumar said that his Malaysian counterpart, Datuk 
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, whom he met on Friday also agreed on the 
need to step up contacts. 
  Both felt that bilateral ties were very good and that 
outstanding issues between the two countries could be resolved. 
  As an example, he said that they noted that discussions 
between both countries were being conducted on two issues on the 
same day as their meeting. 
  They were the disputes over the ownership of Pedra Branca, 
on 
which stands the Horsburgh Lighthouse and which Singapore has 
administered for the past 150 years, and the delineation of the 
Straits of Johor. 
  "We were both optimistic that such issues could be 
resolved," 
he said. 
  Datuk Abdullah, who was present to bid farewell to Prof. 
Jayakumar, interjected that the current approach was the best. 
"Leave it to the present mechanism," he added. 
  Prof. Jayakumar took the opportunity of stressing to his 
Malaysian counterpart the value he attached to the 
Singapore-Malaysia relationship. 
  "With good relations, it will be easier to view in 
perspective the occasional hiccup that may erupt from time to 
time," he added. 
  Prof. Jayakumar, who is also law minister, was on his first 
overseas trip since he took over the portfolio in a cabinet 
reshuffle earlier this month. 
  He said that his visit was in line with the tradition for a 
newly appointed minister to call on his ASEAN counterpart and to 
establish personal rapport. 
  Prof. Jayakumar, who first met his Malaysian counterpart 
about 10 years ago, said that he attached great importance to 
personal ties as they formed a vital ingredient in establishing 
a good working relationship. 
  Datuk Abdullah has accepted an invitation from his Singapore 
counterpart to visit the republic later this year. 
  Other Malaysian leaders whom Prof. Jayakumar met were Law 
Minister Datuk Syed Hamid Albar and Deputy Home Affairs Minister 
Datuk Megat Junid Megat Ayub.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Let Bosnia Fight Fair"] </F>
  [Text] Not long after Bosnia erupted into civil war 21 
months ago, the international community gambled that if it could 
fudge its commitment to peacekeeping long enough, the conflict 
would sooner or later fizzle out and be forgotten. It has not 
paid off; instead, with each passing day the stakes have 
increased to a point where the poverty of conscience is 
bordering on ennui. The impatience of the major powers in the 
shambolic [as published] Bosnian peacekeeping operation to 
consign the tragedy to remote memory has left them questioning 
themselves about how little they can get by with in dealing with 
the Bosnias of the future. With their default over Bosnia more 
or less a done deal, the NATO countries at their summit last 
week hastened to reassure themselves that the Atlantic alliance 
could still uphold lofty principle on elaborate pretense alone. 
  For while the post-Cold War world resolves its geopolitics 
in 
the absence of a clear definition of friend and foe, it is 
pretentious to assume that self-interest is anything less than 
paramount. Both France and Britain, the main participating 
nations in the Bosnian peacekeeping presence, have hinted that 
that interest would not be further served by exposing their 
troops in an inconclusive conflict. Those troops might be 
withdrawn if no agreement is reached by the spring -- it would 
be pointless to stay on when the injustice of the carve-up plan 
has been conceded as a given. The Bosnian Government cannot 
accept the residue of their country as offered so far, and have 
no choice but to keep on fighting. With its back against the 
wall, it had been prepared to yield up to two-thirds of its 
territory in return for a face-saving and economically viable 
peace. Between immolation and a humiliating vestige of their 
former sovereignty, the Bosnian Muslims are making the only 
dignified choice. Having stayed neutral on the terms of a peace 
settlement, the Europeans see no point in turning their token 
gestures into sitting ducks. 
  Apart from the extremist elements, the Bosnian Muslims know 
that they cannot win back all that they have lost. The realists 
hope to regain the bulk of central Bosnia and wrest by force the 
minimal concessions that they had thus far failed to obtain by 
negotiation. The greatest irony of the West's dereliction over 
the Bosnia issue is that the basis for their inaction has not 
come to bear -- the conflict did not end quickly. It is now 
safe to conjecture that had the arms embargo been lifted, the 
fighting would have taken less time to come to a truce, with an 
eventual deadlocked armistice. No matter how tense such an armed 
stand-off might have been, it would have been wrought at less 
suffering. Ethno-religious rivalry exacts greater attrition the 
longer it is left to fester. The sooner an impasse is reached 
with reasonable grounds staked out, the more amenable will the 
combatants be to a practical detente. 
  Such "what if's" will no doubt keep historians busy in time 
to come. What would make them busier still is the external and 
incidental costs of the international community's betrayal of 
principle. It is already obvious to most Muslims worldwide that 
their interests are incompatible with those of that community's 
Western leaders, vaunted principles notwithstanding. The scale 
of Bosnia's neglect might be small enough to be easily 
forgotten. But the religious sectarianism with which that 
conflict was fought will be remembered for a long time yet.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jan 21 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Malaysian 
Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamed has blamed the United Nations 
(UN) for the suffering of the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
ticking off the international body for what he described as not 
discharging duties entrusted to it. 
  In another of his strong speech criticising the 
international 
community over the plight of the Bosnians, the prime minister 
said UN had not only put its integrity in question but also the 
sincerity of the so-proclaimed champions of human rights. 
  At a function where he received a standing ovation from a 
group of Bosnians now taking shelter in Malaysia, he also 
expressed his sadness that the international community had 
chosen to stand by and watch the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
continued to face the merciless aggression of the Serbs. 
  If we accept what is happening to the Bosnians now as 
legitimate and right, then our civilisation is coming to an end, 
he said when launching the books Voices of Malaysia, Suara 
Keperihatinan Malaysia and Bosnia: Testament To War Crimes As 
Told By Survivors here Thursday. 
  At the ceremony, attended by corporate leaders, senior 
government officers and politicians, more than RM1 million 
[Malaysian currency] was collected for the Bosnian fund which Dr 
Mahathir said, proved that they were still humans, symphathising 
for the Bosnians. 
  In criticising the UN, Dr Mahathir said it was clear that it 
was the United Nations that was holding down the Bosnians with 
its policies of arms embargo over Bosnia-Herzegovina, over 
protecting the UN troops and failing to apply pressure against 
Serbia. 
  The embargo had left the Bosnian Muslims defenceless against 
the Serbs, he said, adding that it was apparent that the Western 
powers did not want their soldiers even to get hurt, and not to 
mentiom killed and that they did nothing to protect the Bosnians 
Muslims. 
  What good are they called soldiers. We might as well call 
the 
civilians or small children to do their jobs, he said. 
  Prominent social worker Dr Alijah Gordon, who edited the 
book 
Bosnia: Testament To War Crimes As Told By Survivors, criticised 
UNESCO for failing to protect priceless manuscripts in Sarajevo 
from being destroyed by the Serbs.

  [Excerpts] Seremban, Wed -- Former Sabah Foundation 
director Datuk Dr. Jeffrey Kitingan was today released without 
any conditions from restricted residence under the Internal 
Security Act [ISA]. 
  This was confirmed by Negri Sembilan police chief SAC 
[Senior 
Assistant Commissioner] 1 Abas Johar here. 
  Kitingan was released from the Kamunting detention camp on 
December 22 last year after being held there under the Internal 
Security Act since May 13,1991, and put under restricted 
residence in Seremban for a duration of not more than two years. 
Under the earlier restriction order, Kitingan was not allowed 
to write or help to write any article that is political in 
nature, hold gatherings in his house or compound or in any 
building under his control or make Press statements. 
  Kitingan, 45, collected his release letter after police 
officers escorted him from the Allson Klana Resort hotel to the 
police headquarters at 12.25pm [0425 GMT]. 
  He said he was very happy and thanked Prime Minister Datuk 
Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, who is also Home Minister, for 
releasing him unconditionally. 
  "I am very happy and I take this opportunity to thank Dr. 
Mahathir for releasing me without any conditions," he told 
reporters at the hotel lobby. 
  Kitingan said he hoped the Prime Minister would also release 
other Sabah people who were still under restricted residence. 
  He said he would leave for Sabah tomorrow morning. 
  Asked if he would contest a seat in the forthcoming Sabah 
State elections, he said, he would do so if he was named as a 
candidate. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jan. 22 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- The United 
Nations Security Council must be prepared to use force, if 
necessary, to make the aggressors in Bosnia-Herzegovina comply 
with certain critical requirements, Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said 
Saturday. 
  Among the critical requirements were the lifting of the 
siege 
of Sarajevo by silencing or removing the Serbian heavy artillery 
surrounding the city and the opening of Tuzla Airport to enable 
food, medicine, and other essentials to reach major surrounding 
towns, the prime minister added. 
  All concerned parties must be made to permit, by force if 
necessary, the unhindered flow of humanitarian assistance, he 
told an international conference of parliamentarians on Bosnia- 
Herzegovina here. 
  These actions are necessary especially to save innocent 
lives 
during the harsh winter, he said in a keynote address to about 
180 parliamentarians from more than 30 countries attending the 
two-day conference. 
  Also here for the conference was Bosnian President Alija 
Izetbegovic. 
  Dr. Mahathir said Sarajevo remained under siege to this day, 
surrounded by Serbian guns capable of delivering 800 rounds of 
shells each day, although, for the fifth time, Western nations 
had threatened to launch air-strikes against the Serbs. 
  And for the fifth time, the Serbs have thumbed their noses 
at 
these so-called righteous great powers. Of course, no air-strike 
is mounted, he added. He said the Serbs knew that the bark of 
these defenders of human rights was worse then their bite. And 
so they will go on raping and murdering, fully convinced that 
they will not only go unpunished but they will be actually 
rewarded, he added. This was because the so-called civilised 
world was not prepared to stop the Serbs although it was 
horrified, he said. 
  Dr. Mahathir said the Americans were blaming the British and 
the French for preventing the use of air strikes against the 
Serbs. He added, however, some very highly placed British and 
French sources told him that it was the United States which was 
against the military action. [Word indistinct] frankly do not 
know whom to believe, he said, adding that he suspected neither 
the Americans nor the Europeans cared enough to act as they did 
not wish to risk the lives of their soldiers for something that 
was not really very important for their own well-being. 
  Dr. Mahathir said it was obvious that no one really approved 
of what the Serbs were doing. But, the Western governments 
remain obdurate, refusing to see anything wrong in their blatant 
disregard for the wholesale violation of every item of human 
rights by the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina, he added. 
  As such, Dr. Mahathir said, it was now up to the 
parliamentarians to help shock their people and governments out 
of their self-imposed stupor. 
  They should request their respective governments to place 
the 
issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina high on their country's 
international agenda and call for the resumption of meaningful 
talks aimed at a lasting and just settlement, ne added. 
  Assert your rights as members of the United Nations to 
insist 
that the Security Council act decisively to end the sufferings 
of the Bosnian people and bring back peace to that country, he 
said. 
  To do this, they should firstly exert pressure on the UN 
Security Council to implement the various resolutions on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina which the council had passed. 
  The second thing you should do is to urge the Security 
Council to take a hard look at the Geneva process and since 
there is wide agreement that the Geneva talks cannot go on as 
before, seize the opportunity to convene a new international 
conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina, he added.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jan. 22 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Bosnian 
President Alija Izetbegovic Saturday called on the international 
community to implement the more than 30 resolutions adopted by 
the United Nations to end Serb atrocities against Bosnians in 
the former Yugoslav republic. He said so far only one 
resolution -- the arms embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina -- had 
been enforced. 
  This resolution is against the interest of Bosnians as they 
are unable to defend themselves from the Serb atrocities, he 
told the international conference of parliamentarians on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina here. 
  The two-day conference attended by about 180 
parliamentarians 
from more than 30 countries was opened by Malaysian Prime 
Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed. 
  Referring to Article 51 of the UN Charter which says that an 
independent state under atteck had every right to defend itself, 
Izetbegovic called on the UN to lift the embargo. 
  He said his people were not seeking an ideological state of 
any kind but only wanted to preserve a democratic secular state. 
  He dismissed the misconception that the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina was either a civil war or religious war. 
  It is actually genocide... It's the war against every 
religion, he said. 
  Izetbegovic said the war could not be stopped through 
appeals 
or resolutions. The aggressors don't understand this type of 
logic. We have to confront force with force, he added. 
  After the failure of the recent peace negotiations in 
Geneva, 
we (the Bosnian Muslims) have been accused of rejecting calls 
for peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We don't reject peace, he said. 
  He added that the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina into three 
mini-ethnic states was meant to confine Bosnian Muslims and 
deprive them of access to the sea. 
  Izetbegovic said children and adults, young and old, were 
being murdered and driven from their homes, while the women 
faced constant rape in bosnia where concentration camps just 
like those during World War II have reemerged. 
  He expressed appreciation to Dr. Mahathir and the Malaysian 
people for their continued support to seek and ensure justice 
and fairness for the Bosnians. 
  He said Malaysia's multicultural and multireligious 
population was similar to that of his country. 
  Malaysia has proven that there can be tolerance in such a 
society, he added. 
  Izetbegovic hoped the conference would pave the way for an 
international campaign against Serb atrocities in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jan. 22 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Prime 
Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed has assured Bosnia-Herzegovina 
that Malaysia will continue to help its suffering people, 
Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Saturday. 
  Briefing reporters on the talks between Dr. Mahathir and 
visiting Bosnia-Herzegovina President Alija Izetbegovic, 
Abdullah said discussions at ministerial and senior official 
level between the two countries would be held to work out 
details of the aid. 
  Izetbegovic, who is on a four-day visit to Malaysia, and Dr. 
Mahathir met alone before being joined by their respective 
delegations for another meeting which lasted more than an hour. 
  The president also delivered a keynote address at the 
influential conference of parliamentarians on Bosnia, which 
began here Saturday. 
  The Malaysian delegation to the meeting included senior 
officials from the Prime Minister's Department, the Foreign 
Ministry, the Defence Ministry, and the National Unity and 
Social Development Ministry. 
  Abdullah said the discussions between the two delegations 
had 
resulted in a very clear understanding of the problems facing 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  He said apart from strengthening cooperation between the two 
governments, the meeting had also enabled Malaysia to understand 
Bosnia's stand in declining the offer made at the latest peace 
talks in Geneva. 
  We understand their position and will continue to support 
them at international conferences, Abdullah said. 
  He said Bosnia regretted very much the West's accusation 
that 
they were the obstacle to peace in the Balkans for refusing the 
offer made by the West. 
  How will they accept the offer when land seized from them is 
given to the Serb and Croatian invaders and also when they have 
no access to the sea. It tantamounts to surrender, Abdullah said.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jan. 24 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia's 
proposal to convene a new international conference to solve the 
conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina has received the support of 
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic. 
  Izetbegovic said: We believe that convening a new 
international conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina on a larger basis 
and including a larger number of participants would be useful, 
especially if it will reaffirm the principles passed at the 
London (peace) conference last year. 
  It was obvious that the last round of talks convened in 
Geneva a few days ago had exhausted all possibilities, he told a 
press conference here Monday to mark the end of his four-day 
working visit to Malaysia. 
  Earlier, Izetbegovic held a four-eyed meeting with Deputy 
Prime Minister Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim. The meeting lasted for 
an hour. 
  The idea to convene the new peace conference was mooted by 
Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed in his address when opening 
the two-day international conference of parliamentarians on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina on Saturday. 
  The 10 parliamentarians from more than 30 countries, who 
attended the international conference of parliamentarians on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, also called for fresh peace initiatives, 
including the convening of a new international conference, 
citing the non-accountability of the present mediators in the 
on-going peace negotiations to the United Nations. 
  Asked if the other two warring factions -- Serbs and Croats 
-- would agree to such a conference, Izetbegovic said: I cannot 
be sure about the attitude of the other sides. 
  He reiterated, however, that the conflict and violence in 
the 
former Yugoslav republic could not be solved through resolutions 
and appeals. 
  There is no case in history in which any violence and force 
was stopped by resolutions or an appeal no matter how good the 
resolution was, he said through his daughter, Sabina, who acted 
as interpreter. 
  Izetbegovic said he would attend the next round of peace 
talks in Geneva scheduled for Feb. 10.

  [Text] THAI RAT correspondents went to Shan State to 
interview Khun Sa, who was surrounded by his armed security 
guards. For the first time, he made known his wish to quit 
being the number-one drug kingpin. He has appealed to U.S. 
President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Chuan Likphai to help 
the Shan State become heroin-free, instead of spending large 
sums of money on drug suppression. 
  The interview with drug warlord Khun Sa or Chang Si-fu, took 
place after the drug kingpin, who declared himself president of 
the Shan State Restoration Council, sent his close aide to 
contact THAI RAT. Khun Sa said he wished to tell the world 
about the present situation in Shan State, once a major heroin 
production center. He wished to make known to the world that 
the Shan State is now heroin-free. He added that he wanted the 
U.S. President to assist the Shan State in this way instead of 
dumping huge amounts of money into drug suppression. 
  The THAI RAT correspondents left with Khun Sa's men for an 
interview with the drug kingpin. They went north by car for 
about 75 kilometers from the Thai-Burmese border in Mae Hong Son 
Province passing ridges and forests. At 1245 on 20 January, 
they arrived in Shan State where they met Khun Sa, a 60-year-old 
man whose Thai name is Chan Changtrakun. He was wearing a white 
shirt, a green field jacket, and blue trousers. He had about 
ten bodyguards with him and they arrived in a light truck. Khun 
Sa invited reporters to a house in the middle of the forest 
where he receives guests. 
  Then the interview began. Chang Si-fu, the most-wanted drug 
kingpin with a huge ransom on his head, told THAI RAT that he 
would like countries playing a major role in narcotics 
suppression to know that he has given up all narcotics-related 
activities, and that he wants the Shan State under him to become 
heroin-free. He asked THAI RAT to relay this message to Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai, and U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  Khun Sa said that whenever a drug crime was committed, 
people 
would point their fingers at him and accuse him of being the 
source of the drugs. He said that he has closed off the 
trafficking route. Opium products peddled to the outside world 
now come from another area close to Shan State where production 
amounted to some 6,000 tons annually. He admitted that he 
received a toll on those products. Now that other routes are 
being used in heroin trafficking, he said he is not earning any 
money and is short of funds to support the 8 million people in 
Shan State. 
  "The United Nations did not pay us any attention. We need 
help in training for jobs other than opium growing. Shan State 
is rich in mineral resources. We have forests and blue 
sapphires. I want the world to be fair to the Shan people. I 
want Shan State to be heroin-free. But I don't know who is 
going to believe me. If the Thai prime minister considers this 
an important issue, he should then coordinate with the U.S. 
President," he said. 
  Khun Sa said the Thai Government could turn the Golden 
Triangle into an opium-free zone. If the Thai Government offers 
him cooperation, Thailand would become the first country to 
successfully close off the trafficking route in which Thailand 
is a transit point. He said he is willing to open up Shan State 
for investment, trade, and tourism. And as drought is a problem 
that plagues Thailand annually, he is willing to let the Thai 
Government divert water from the Salween River for the Thai 
people. 
  "If Thailand and the United States are sincere about 
narcotics suppression at the Golden Triangle, this is a good 
opportunity because I have quit and I am ready for visits and 
inspections from every party, in exchange for development of the 
Shan State. We want to have legitimate contact with the outside 
world," Khun Sa said.

  [Excerpt] Khun Sa, president of the Shan State Restoration 
Council, spoke in an exclusive interview with PHUCHATKAN. He 
said that he sent letters to U.S. President Bill Clinton and 
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai in October and asked for 
cooperation from the United States, the United Nations, and the 
Thai Government for his efforts to stop opium growing and heroin 
production in the Shan State. Khun Sa, or Chang Si-fu in 
Chinese, during the interview from his stronghold in the central 
town of the Shan state which is opposite Thailand's Mae Hong Son 
Province, said that as far as he knew, President Clinton had 
forwarded the matter to the Thai prime minister and asked the 
latter to study ways to assist the Thai Yai ethnic people in 
Shan State to stop growing poppies. Khun Sa said of his bid to 
lobby for financial funding that he did not have much hope that 
there would be any assistance from international organizations 
because most organizations only have tried to paint a negative 
picture of him as an international outlaw. 
  Khun Sa, however, did not entirely dismiss a chance for 
success for his crop replacement plan for the Shan State. He 
said the campaign to reduce poppy growing and finally root out 
opium cultivation in Shan State will materialize within five 
years if there is money for him to implement the crops 
replacement plan and vocational training projects. Most 
importantly, he said, the Burmese military government must also 
stop supporting poppy growing and heroin production. He said: 
"If opium growing is eliminated in Shan State while Burma 
continues to allow it, the Thai Yai people in Shan State will be 
forced to run away and join with Burmese troops so that they can 
continue to make a living by growing poppies." [passage omitted 
on Khun Sa's political goals]

  [Excerpt] BANGKOK, Jan 23 (AFP) -- All of the soldiers 
guarding the home of Burmese dissident and Nobel laureate Aung 
San Suu Kyi have been withdrawn, western diplomats in Rangoon 
said Sunday. 
  "They are gone from the outside of the house. I don't know 
about the inside," one diplomat said when reached by telephone 
from Bangkok. A second western diplomat, also contacted by 
telephone from Bangkok, confirmed that said the guards were 
absent from outside the house. 
  "I passed along (the street in front of) her residence last 
night and the two guard boxes were not there any longer," he 
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The second diplomat 
also said there still could be guards inside the residence, and 
speculated they could have been pulled from outside the house to 
make the military government look good to the increasing number 
of tourists visiting Rangoon. 
  "It is too soon to draw any conclusions, but it is 
definitely 
the first time (the guards have been withdrawn) since she was 
put under house arrest" on July 20, 1989, he said. 
  The first official, who also declined to be identified by 
name, refused to speculate as to why the soldiers guarding the 
complex on Rangoon's University Avenue had been withdrawn. 
  "But I don't think it is terribly significant," he said.

  [Excerpts] BANGKOK, Jan 23 (AFP) -- Long an irresistable 
magnet for visiting journalists and tourists alike, the high 
profile soldiers and security police guarding the Rangoon home 
of Burma's most high-profile dissident Aung San Suu Kyi have 
been withdrawn, diplomats there said Sunday. 
  An AFP reporter in Rangoon confirmed the armed guards and 
wooden guard boxes on either side of the entrance to her home 
had been removed. But security remained tight outside the house 
and there was no indication the status of the 1991 Nobel Peace 
Prize winner -- who has been under house arrest since July 20, 
1989 -- had changed. 
  The section of the road leading to her lakeside compound on 
University Avenue remained barricaded to traffic at night and 
security inside the house was believed to still be tight as well. 
  The military government did not announce the move and 
Burmese 
officials could not be reached for comment. But sources said 
the junta probably was tired of scores of foreign reporters 
visiting the house and taking forbidden photographs, and the 
removal of the uniformed guards and police likely was intended 
to make the house look more like others in the area. [passage 
omitted] 
  The Rangoon government has said the diminutive dissident, 
the 
daughter of Burmese independence hero Aung San, may end her 
"restriction" any time she wants -- as long as she leaves Burma. 
But Aung San Suu Kyi has refused to go into exile, knowing her 
continued detention attracts worldwide attention.

<F P=106> [By Yindi Loetcharoenchok in Rangoon] </F>
  [Text] THE fate of Burma's detained popular leader Aung 
San Suu Kyi remains uncertain despite earlier speculation she 
will be released in July, five years after she was placed under 
house arrest. It is, however, obvious that the ruling State Law 
and Order Restoration Council (Slorc) has no immediate plan to 
set her free and has instead devised legal measures to continue 
her unlawful detention and to bar her future participation in 
Burmese politics. 
  There remains ambiguity over the state of Suu Kyi's 
detention 
and her freedom, but a group of Slorc's legal advisers told 
visiting foreign reporters on Friday that she will not be 
released when her five-year term of detention expires on July 20. 
  They ambiguously explained that Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel 
Peace 
Prize laureate and the most outspoken critic of the military's 
heavy-handed policies against pro-democracy demonstrations can 
be held up to six years according to "existing laws". They also 
strongly rejected the term "detention" used to describe Suu 
Kyi's house arrest, arguing that it is only a "restriction" and 
that the military rulers have been dealing with her "leniently". 
  Five of Slorc's legal experts led by Chief Justice U Aung 
Toe 
and Attorney General U Tha Tun told a press conference Suu Kyi's 
house arrest "was not decided by the court", but by the 
"existing laws which stipulate that her restriction period will 
not be construed as expiring on July 20 this year". 
  They said her case "is an executive issue and not a legal 
issue", and that "at the decision of a three-member central body 
a person can be restricted up to one year, and at the decision 
of the government a person can be restricted up to five years". 
The central body, they said, comprises the ministers of foreign 
affairs, home affairs and defence. 
  Burmese and foreign observers here said it was the first 
time 
they had heard of the existence of such a central body which 
could arbitrarily sentence people to a year in prison. They 
believe Slorc will amend the laws to extend Suu Kyi's detention 
and that she will not be released until a new Constitution is 
drafted and promulgated, with many provisions that will restrict 
her political role in Burmese politics. 
  The Slorc's appointed National Convention resumed its 
meeting 
on Jan 18 after a four-month break to discuss the three 
sensitive issues of the state presidency, the state and its 
structure. It is clear from the detailed and lengthy opening 
speech of Chief Justice U Aung Toe, also chairman of the 
National Convention's work committee, that all the guidelines 
and qualifications for a new charter have already been devised 
to bar Suu Kyi, a mother of two sons whose husband is a British 
professor at Oxford University, from running in the presidential 
elections. 
  Although Aung Toe urged the 668 delegates to exchange views 
on the three issues, it was obvious from his speech they were 
being warned not to stray from "basic principles" which had 
already been laid down. 
  Among other qualifications, the presidential candidate is 
required to be rich in political, administrative, economic and 
military experience and must have resided continuously in the 
country for at least 20 years. Moreover, the candidate, his 
parents, spouse, children and their spouses are not to owe 
allegiance to a foreign power, must not be subjects or citizens 
of a foreign power, and must not be entitled to the rights and 
privileges of a subject or citizen of a foreign power. 
  Attorney General U Tha Tun, also a member of the 
convention's 
working committee, said two previous constitutions in 1947 and 
1974 also stipulated that the state president should not owe 
allegiance to a foreign power.

<F P=106> [By Yindi Loetcharoenchok in Rangoon] </F>
  [Text] THE Burmese junta expects to hold a ceasefire 
ceremony with Kachin forces in the north of the country, by 
early next month. The occasion, in Myitkyina, will mark the 
official end to armed hostilities which began when the Kachin 
formed the Kachin Independence Organization and its armed wing 
in 1961 to fight Rangoon for greater autonomy. 
  Despite a ceasefire deal, the Kachin will retain their arms 
and ammunition as the two sides have yet to resolve political 
issues of power sharing and greater autonomy for the Kachin 
State. 
  Lt Gen Khin Nyunt, for the State Law and Order Restoration 
Council, and the Kachin chief of staff, Brig Gen Zau Mai, will 
represent their respective sides at the ceremony which will also 
include some festivities. 
  Lt Gen Maung Thint, minister for development of border areas 
and ethnic minorities, said in an interview on Friday that there 
would be no signing of a truce agreement at the ceremony. 
  The Kachin group, like nine other armed ethnic groups which 
have earlier struck ceasefire deals with Rangoon, will be 
allowed to retain its weapons for safety reasons. 
  "There will be no signing of a peace treaty. It is like a 
pledge between the government and the group and will take place 
by the end of this month or beginning of next month," he said 
through interpreters. 
  "The deal (with the Kachin) will be like that with other 
groups. We will assist them as we do the other groups. We will 
allow them to hold arms for their own safety, not for 
hostilities, and the government has pledged to cooperate with 
them in implementing development projects in their areas," he 
added. 
  Maung Thint said that eventually a peace accord worked out 
between the government and the rebel groups will include the 
laying down of arms. 
  In an interview later the same day, Col Kyaw Win, deputy 
director of the powerful Directorate of Defence Services 
Intelligence, said the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) will have 
to disarm itself if it wants to participate in the National 
Convention, which is in the process of drawing a new 
constitution, or if it wants to establish a political party. 
  A Kachin official, speaking during a long-distance telephone 
interview yesterday, said he had no comment at the moment about 
the Slorc-KIA ceasefire ceremony. He added that the KIA wants 
to see a nationwide ceasefire and that it was still too early to 
comment about eventual disarmament. 
  Col Kyaw Win said separate negotiations between Rangoon and 
two remaining armed ethnic forces, the Mon and Karenni, which 
are active along the Thai-Burmese border, are still in progress 
and that he expects the groups to reach a ceasefire deal with 
Slorc within the next two to three months. He said official 
negotiations between Rangoon and the strongest remaining ethnic 
rival, the Karen, could take place soon, and that the two sides 
have already held preliminary talks in Thailand. 
  The intelligence officer said official Slorc-Karen meetings 
have to be held in Burma as Rangoon considers the matter an 
internal issue.

  [Text] Mae Hong Son -- The Karen National Union [KNU] 
insisted yesterday that it will join the State Law and Order 
Restoration Council [SLORC] at the negotiating table only if the 
talks are held on equal terms with an ultimate goal of full 
freedom and rights for all Burmese citizens. 
  KNU president Gen Bo Mya told 500 guests, who attended his 
67th birthday celebrations at his Manerplaw camp opposite Mae 
Sariang district, that the Karen always wanted national 
reconciliation but their three offers for peace talks had not 
received any response from SLORC. Gen Bo Mya criticised other 
minority groups for giving up their armed struggle against 
Rangoon. 
  "The KNU will definitely conduct peace talks with SLORC if 
the negotiations are on equal terms to sincerely obtain rights 
and freedom in all economic, social and political fields for all 
Burmese groups. The peace agreement reached separately with 
various minority groups does not guarantee a true peace." 
  Gen Bo Mya, who leads the strongest anti-Rangoon minority 
group, said the KNU would not join SLORC at the negotiating 
table until Rangoon accepted all these conditions. 
  The truce talks, if agreed on, could be held in a third 
country such as Thailand which cherished "the constructive 
engagement" policy with SLORC, Gen Bo Mya said.

<F P=106> [Report by Larry Jagan from the "Current International </F>
Affairs" program] 
  [Text] The Karen National Union [KNU], the strongest armed 
minority group in Burma, is still hoping to hold peace talks 
with the State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC] jointly 
with other minority groups. 
  In his birthday speech to members of the Burmese opposition 
groups gathered at Manerplaw yesterday, General Saw Bo Mya 
reassured them the KNU will hold talks with the SLORC in 
accordance with the principles laid down by the Democratic 
Alliance of Burma [DAB]. Gen. Saw Bo Mya also stressed the need 
for continued unity in the opposition movement. Larry Jagan, in 
his report, noted the 12 students detained at Manerplaw were 
released in view of this desired unity. 
  A report from the group leader of the All Burma Students' 
Democratic Front [ABSDF] and other sources claimed ABSDF leader 
Moe Thee Zun is now safe and secure. An opposition source at 
the Thai-Burma border noted the KNU released the 12 students 
detained on Sunday. The students also explained that the 
misunderstandings have now been cleared. According to 
yesterday's announcement of the National Council of the Union of 
Burma [NCUB], which includes the armed minority groups, 
students, and Dr. Sein Win's National Coalition Government of 
the Union of Burma [NCGUB] -- a Burmese opposition group, the 
students were not really detained but instead were holding talks 
with KNU leaders. An opposition source said the KNU is worried 
about students taking KNU-supplied arms out of KNU- controlled 
areas, which they agreed not to do from the very beginning. The 
NCUB announcement claimed no problems exists between the KNU and 
the student armed wing and other allied groups. 
  An opposition source from the border explained the students 
are getting very worried about their position since all the 
opposition minority armed groups are holding peace talks with 
the SLORC military government. According to the source, Gen. 
Saw Bo Mya personally affirmed the students have nothing to 
worry about and that they are always welcome. Gen. Saw Bo Mya 
also guaranteed the safety of the students in KNU-controlled 
areas. There is no doubt differences in opinion existed between 
the students and the minority groups in connection with the 
cease-fire talks. At a meeting held in Manerplaw a few days 
ago, members of the NCUB emphatically stressed the need for 
unity in the entire opposition movement. At present, although 
some members still criticize and condemn the SLORC's peace talks 
with individual groups, they also want to prevent the 
disintegration of the opposition movement. All the member 
groups understand that if the opposition movement disintegrates, 
it will become favorable for the SLORC who desires to crush the 
opposition. 
  The KNU leader, Gen. Saw Bo Mya, reiterated in his speech at 
his 66th birthday celebrations held at Manerplaw yesterday, that 
the KNU prefers all opposition groups to hold peace talks with 
SLORC together. Gen. Saw Bo Mya noted, although the KNU will 
hold peace talks, it will also discuss human rights issue, the 
freedom of all national races, and other political problems with 
the SLORC. He said the peace agreement reached separately with 
various minority groups does not guarantee a true peace in 
Burma. Next, Gen. Saw Bo Mya appealed to all other armed 
organizations to work for national reconciliation and urged them 
to participate in the roundtable peace negotiations with SLORC. 
A KNU spokesman said no date has yet been fixed for the first 
preliminary peace talks between the KNU and SLORC. 
  Although the KNU leader has been insisting the peace talks 
be 
held in Bangkok, most observers expect the talks to be held in 
Yangon [Rangoon]. The Thai foreign minister, Prasong Sunsiri, 
said yesterday the Thai Government will consider accepting the 
peace talks proposal only when the SLORC government legally 
informs the Thai Government.

  [Excerpt] BANGKOK, Jan 22 (AFP) -- Two Burmese dissident 
groups disagreed Saturday on whether 12 student leaders had been 
detained by the Karen National Union (KNU) in the ethnic group's 
border headquarters at Manerplaw. 
  A member of the All Burma Students Democratic Front (ABSDF) 
told AFP by telephone that the group's leader, Moe Thee Zun, and 
11 others had been held briefly by the KNU last week and freed 
unharmed. But a Bangkok spokesman for the National Council for 
the Union of Burma (NCUB), the umbrella organization of the 
dissident groups, said the Karens had not held the students and 
a NCUB statement denying reports of the detention was accurate. 
  The statement said the students were holding talks with the 
Karens to "prevent...any misunderstanding...in connection with 
the KNU's decision to hold talks individually with the SLORC 
[State Law and Order Restoraion Council]. There is no serious 
problem between the KNU and the Student Army or any other ally." 
  The Karen National Union and the student's group are 
apparently at odds over the Karens' decision to seek separate 
peace talks with the State Law and Order Restoration Council 
(SLORC), as the Rangoon junta is called. The students want to 
maintain a united front, but other opposition groups have backed 
the Karens, the oldest and most powerful opposition group.

  [Excerpt] CITIZENS faced a fine for non-attendance at 
mass rallies held across Burma during the past week, and 
schoolchildren risked automatic failure in their exams, said a 
western embassy source in Rangoon. 
  The rallies, organised by the military government's new 
Union 
Solidarity and Development Association (USDA) were designed to 
obtain the people's approval for six motions aimed at "the 
emergence of a peaceful, prosperous and modern nation". They 
took place at Rangoon, Mandalay, Meikthila, Taunggyi and in 
other cities. 
  On Thursday at Pegu, 80 kilometres northeast of Rangoon, 
120,000 people were reported to have assembled at the district 
sports stadium for what was the first major political gathering 
in the city since the demonstrations against military rule in 
1988. People congregated at 5.30 a.m., before marching behind 
banners along four different routes from different quarters of 
the city. 
  Some 25,000 came from the west of Pegu alone and passed the 
site of a massacre in August 1988, where seven students were 
shot dead when they confronted the military in the popular 
democracy uprising that claimed the lives of thousands of 
Burmese citizens. The four groups met around the towering 
Shwemawdaw Pagoda, which overlooks the district stadium. 
  Only a fraction of those who arrived could fit inside the 
stadium where USDA officials, including the Central Executive 
Committee Member, U Pan Aung, addressed the rally. People 
started dispersing from around the Pagoda soon after the meeting 
had started. 
  State media reported that six motions were "unanimously 
approved" by over 120,000 at the rally. 
  On the previous day, USDA representatives toured the city in 
vehicles with loudspeakers announcing that at least three 
members of each family should attend. A railway worker said 
that he could not afford to be absent from the meeting or he 
would be fined 200 kyat (equivalent to US$1.70 on the black 
market). 
  "For 200 kyat," the man said, "I can feed my wife and three 
children for two days." 
  The procession to the stadium was marked in part by a 
carnival atmosphere, with musicians and marching bands. The 
military presence was low other than at the entrance near the 
stage, where the USDA officials addressed the rally. 
  A private tutor in the stadium remarked that most Burmese 
easily forgot the sufferings of the past, but remained sceptical 
of USDA rhetoric. 
  "They are happy just to exist," he said. He thought they 
would not have attended without the threat of a fine. [passage

<F P=106> ["Reply from His Excellency Khieu Samphan, chairman of the </F>
Party of Democratic Kampuchea, to Prince Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh, chairman of FUNCINPEC, concerning the king's 
five-point initiative and the establishment of the technical 
group" -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] After receiving a telegram from His Excellency 
[H.E.] Khieu Samphan, chairman of the Party of Democratic 
Kampuchea [PDK], dated 15 January 1994, Prince Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh sent his representative to verbally inform H.E. Khieu 
Samphan of his answer. In this answer Prince Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh specified that the king's five-point initiative is 
fully accepted and that this will be used as the basis for talks 
within the technical group and that all points will be 
implemented at the same time. Furthermore, Prince Krompreah 
Norodom Ranariddh also agreed that the technical group does not 
have to have a name and he asked that the technical group start 
its work immediately. 
  It must be made clear that the representative of the Phnom 
Penh side has also demanded to be included in this technical 
group without yet accepting the king's five-point initiative. 
  On the morning of 21 January 1994, directed by PDK Chairman 
H.E. Khieu Samphan, the PDK representative in Phnom Penh met 
with the representative of FUNCINPEC [National United Front for 
an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia], 
Chairman Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, and verbally 
informed Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh of H.E. Khieu 
Samphan's answer, the essence of which is as follows: 
  1. After thanking Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh for 
sending his representative to verbally convey the message on 17 
January, H.E. Khieu Samphan noted that in the message Prince 
Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh stated that the king's five-point 
initiative has been fully accepted; that this will be used as 
the basis of talks within the technical group; and that all 
points will be implemented at the same time. 
  2. As for the Phnom Penh side, it has categorically opposed 
the king's five-point initiative in successive open statements 
and in concrete actions. 
  Recently, the representative of the Phnom Penh side on 7 
January 1994, and subsequently, openly stated that the PDK 
should first implement the first three points before discussing 
other issues. This is in fact opposing the king's five-point 
policy. Furthermore, national resources have been used to buy 
ammunition, weapons, and military materiel, in an attempt to 
smash Democratic Kampuchean forces to prevent national 
reconciliation. 
  3. In brief, it can be seen that Prince Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh and H.E. Khieu Samphan, namely, FUNCINPEC and the PDK, 
have agreed to and accepted the king's five-point initiative. 
Therefore, the technical group should start working straightaway 
with FUNCINPEC and PDK representatives. 
  4. The Phnom Penh side -- which talks about a three point 
scheme in opposition to the king's five-point initiative -- 
cannot take part in the talks on the five-point political 
guideline. When the Cambodian People's Party accepts the 
five-point advice, its representative will be added to the 
technical group. 
  It should be this way so as to clearly indicate that we 
accept King Sihanouk's five-point initiative as the basis for 
talks within the technical group, because the technical group's 
task is to discuss and talk about political issues with a 
specific agenda. 
  It should be stressed that the Buddhist Liberal Democratic 
Party has also supported the king's five-point initiative.

<F P=106> ["Royal message" to the nation from King Norodom Sihanouk in </F>
Beijing; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] I would like to extend highest respects to the two 
supreme patriarchs, Venerable Patriarchs Khousananda, 
Pouthiveang, and Mongkoltepeacha and to all venerable monks; I 
would like to extend my greetings, profoundest love, and 
everlasting faithfulness to wisemen, nuns, brothers, sisters, 
children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, and all 
compatriots male and female alike: 
  I take this opportunity as the royal government of our 
Cambodian nation -- led by Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, 
first prime minister, and His Excellency [H.E.] Hun Sen, second 
prime minister -- is paying an official visit to the PRC, the 
great nation and friendly country, to send this message to the 
supreme patriarchs and venerable monks as well as wisemen, nuns, 
brothers, sisters, children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, 
and all beloved and respected compatriots male and female alike. 
The message is as follows: 
  1. The cancerous disease in my body has been gradually 
cured. The cancer that remains in my spinal cord is being cured, 
but slowly. This is because my prominent Chinese doctors dare 
not use medicine too strong in the treatment considering my age 
and other illnesses, such as my veins and arteries which have 
hardened due to [words indistinct] and my heart disease. Using 
drugs that are too strong in this kind of medical treatment 
might affect my heart and so forth. A number of the most 
prominent PRC doctors, the very kind brothers, recently met and 
discussed new methods to more effectively eliminate the cancer 
in my spinal cord. My cancer is a very serious illness. This 
is why I need many more months to complete the treatment, 
despite the effective and very thorough care given my these most 
prominent doctors. Although I am not yet cured 100 percent, I 
will certainly return to our motherland in April 1994 to meet 
and join all beloved and respected compatriots in celebrating 
our traditional new year. 
  2. I would like to zealously appeal to my Khmer Rouge [KR] 
children from the Party of Democratic Kampuchea to please stop 
planting mines in our country and to stop destroying our 
nation's roads and bridges. The grenades and mines planted 
inside our territory have caused and are causing miserable harm 
to our compatriots, civilian, old and young, and male and female 
alike. Every month, victims, male and female alike, die or 
become cripples for the rest of their lives. Our country is 
known to have more disabled persons, amputees due to grenades 
and mines, than any country in the world. This is the [words 
indistinct]. 
  I would like once again to appeal to the children who plant 
mines to completely stop all these crimes against our people. 
  All roads and bridges are vitally important to our innocent 
people and our motherland. Those roads and bridges do not serve 
Vietnam. They serve only the interests of our society and the 
economy of our Cambodian people and motherland. 
  At present, our Cambodian motherland has been classified as 
one of the poorest and most underdeveloped countries in the 
world. This is a great shame to our motherland, our nation, and 
every Cambodian. 
  Those children who have planted mines, destroyed houses, 
villages, and the property of our people as well as ruined our 
nation' roads and bridges -- if you really are patriots, you 
should completely and permanently stop from now on all acts to 
destroy the people and your own country. 
  3. I would like to insistently appeal to all children who 
have chosen the wrong way of living by becoming robbers; 
thieves; and bandits, who mercilessly killing both their own 
fellow Cambodians and foreigners, to permanently end all of your 
crimes. These vicious activities degrade your honor as well as 
the prestige of our nation and race and our Cambodian motherland. 
  I know that a large number of you have become thieves, 
robbers, and bandits, who kill people, after you have 
experienced great misery in your families. Most of you have 
chosen these vicious and criminal activities after you have felt 
despair. I will ask our Royal Cambodian Government [RCG] to 
grant you complete pardon if you agree to come out to see Prince 
Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and H.E. Hun Sen, the two prime 
minister of our RCG; pledge to stop robbing, plundering, and 
killing people; and agree to come out to lead a life like all 
other ordinary citizen and render yourselves worthy of being the 
sons of independent Cambodia and our Angkor motherland. The RCG 
will not forget all of you who [words indistinct] and will seek 
honest jobs for you. 
  In conclusion, I would like to extend best wishes to the two 
supreme patriarchs, Patriarchs Khousananda, Pouthiveang, and 
Mongkoktepeacha; all venerable monks; wisemen; nuns; brothers; 
sisters; children; grandchildren; great grandchildren; and all 
beloved and respected compatriots. May you enjoy Lord Buddha's 
five blessings -- longevity, social prestige, happiness, 
strength, and enlightenment.

  [Text] This afternoon His Excellency [H.E.] Ing Kiet, state 
minister and minister of public works and transport; and H.E. Pu 
Sothirak, minister of industry, mines, and energy, together 
received H.E. Wolfgang Schallenberg, Austrian deputy foreign 
minister. The talks concerned the plan to repair the Kirirom 
hydropower network. 
  H.E. Austrian Deputy Foreign Minister said that a plan to 
restore the Kirirom hydropower network, worth about $11 million, 
will be signed between Austria and Cambodia in the near future. 
Austria will dispatch technicians to carry out this plan. The 
Kirirom hydropwer station was built in 1965 by the former 
Yugoslavia and was operational in 1968. This station provided 
up to 10,000 kilowatts of power during the rainy season and 
about 5,000 kilowatt in the dry season. Many parts, however, 
have been damaged since 1970 when the hydropower station was 
abandoned. 
  Austria and Sweden have been authorized by the Royal 
Government of Cambodia to study the plan to restore this 
hydropower network. Austria plans to provide about $11 million 
for the project and another $46,000 for protection and mine 
clearing in the Kirirom area.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 24 (KCNA) -- The North side 
headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's 
Reunification (Pomminnyon) will not tolerate any legal and 
institutional mechanism obstructive to great national unity and 
any move of the anti-reunification forces, declared its 
chairman, Paek In-chun, in a statement today vowing to reunify 
the country in the 1990s without fail. 
  The statement was issued on the lapse of three years since 
the inauguration of the North side headquarters of Pomminnyon. 
  Paek In-chun recalled that since the formation of 
Pomminnyon, 
its organisations had vigorously waged a joint struggle, 
contributing to strengthening the internal forces of national 
reunification and inciting the nation's desire for reunification 
at home and abroad. 
  The great leader President Kim Il-song in his New Year 
address called on all Koreans at home and abroad to open a new 
phase for national reunification, the chairman noted, and [words 
indistinct] of the North side headquarters of Pomminnyon to make 
this year "A year of great national unity" and a year of a new 
phase for national reunification so that the country may 
certainly be reunified in the 1990s. 
  He said: 
  "The present rulers of South Korea are increasing tensions 
between the North and the South, while scheming to continue the 
`Team Spirit' joint military exercises and other large-scale 
manoeuvres. And they are further intensifying the suppression 
of the pro-reunification patriotic forces of South Korea by 
invoking the `National Security Law' which defines fellow 
countrymen in the North as the `enemy.' 
  "The Kim Yong-sam group seeking confrontation and division 
against the fellow countrymen's desire for reunification far 
outdistances the former military dictators in craftiness and 
viciousness. 
  "We, regarding those who antagonize Pomminnyon, the mother 
body of great national unity, and try to disintegrate and outlaw 
it as the enemy of the nation who obstructs the reunification of 
the country and the unity of the nation, will staunchly fight to 
get rid of them. 
  "We strongly demand that the present South Korean 
authorities, who have persistently rejected the formation of the 
South side headquarters of Pomminnyon, promptly stop their 
perfidious acts and positively ensure Pomminnyon's patriotic 
activities for reunification." 
  Paek In-chun called on the 70 million fellow countrymen in 
the North, South and overseas to join Pomminnyon in stepping up 
the grand march towards reunification, under the banner of great 
national unity.

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN Supports Patriotic Initiative of Pomminnyon </F>
Overseas Headquarters" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 19 (KCNA) -- The overseas 
headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's 
Reunification (Pomminnyon) proposed that this year be made a 
"Year of Great National Unity" and called upon the North and 
South sides of Korea to launch a joint campaign in the North, 
South and overseas for the great unity of the whole nation. 
Supporting this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says: This is a 
very timely and just patriotic initiative in view of the desire 
of the fellow countrymen for reunification and the domestic and 
foreign situation. 
  The Central Committee of the North side headquarters of 
Pomminnyon highly estimated the initiative as a good proposal, 
expressed full support to it and warmly welcomed it. 
  The reunification question of Korea is a question of 
terminating the domination and interference of outside forces 
and fully realizing the sovereignty of the Korean nation and 
achieving national unity; it is a nationwide cause which the 70 
million fellow countrymen at home and abroad should accomplish, 
united as one under the banner of the great unity of the whole 
nation. 
  Great national unity is the basic idea of Pomminnyon and 
reunification in the 90s is its noble duty to the nation. 
  The Pomminnyon organisations at home and abroad should 
jointly and energetically organize and conduct the patriotic 
movement for reunification to achieve great national unity by 
availing themselves of all possibilities and occasions and thus 
brilliantly adorn this significant year as a "Year of Great 
National Unity". 
  All the compatriots at home and abroad should frustrate the 
anti-national, anti-reunification reactionary offensive of the 
Kim Yong-sam group under the "civilian" veil and actively 
promote the great national unity in this course.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 19 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON today 
carries a commentary captioned "Anti-Reunification Act of 
Civilian Fascist". 
  The Kim Yong-sam group Monday arrested a student of Chonpuk 
National University Ho Hyon-chun, former vice-chairman of the 
South side headquarters of the Pan-National Alliance of Youth 
and Students for the Country's Reunification, on the charge of 
the "violation of the National Security Law". He was put on the 
"want list" for his involvement in the pan-national rally last 
year. Branding this as another fascist offensive against the 
pro-reunification patriotic forces and an anti-reunification 
crime, the analyst says: 
  It was out of the patriotic desire to bring earlier national 
reunification, the nation's wish, that the students in the North 
and the South last year discussed the matters of opening a grand 
reunification festival of students, holding talks at Panmunjom 
and confirming the reunification formula. 
  Unable to sit at one place, they debated on matters 
regarding 
reunification in the form of telephone dialogue. It was a 
patriotic deed to contribute to the noble cause of national 
reunification, as befits the standard-bearers of the country's 
reunification. It can never be a target of suppression. 
  But, taking issue with it, the Kim Yong-sam group blocked 
the 
students' reunification festival and arrested many patriotic 
people and, as if it were not enough, arrested one more student 
this time. This is a never-to-be- condoned act. 
  The "civilian regime" of Kim Yong-sam group is no more than 
a 
veil, which is not different from the former military fascist 
regimes at all. 
  There is nothing to expect from the present regime.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 22 (KCNA) -- A memorial service 
for the late Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, a patriotic champion for 
reunification of South Korea, was held in Pyongyang today. 
  Rev. Mun was a reputed patriotic champion for reunification 
who devoted his all to the struggle for the independence and 
democratisation of South Korean society and the reunification of 
the country. 
  Seen on the platform of the hall of the memorial service 
were 
a portrait of the deceased wearing black ribbons and wreaths 
from the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the 
Fatherland, the Korean Christian Federation and other public 
organisations. 
  Present at the memorial service were Yang Hyong-sop, 
alternate Politburo member of the C.C. [Central Committee], the 
Workers' Party of Korea, chairman of the Supreme People's 
Assembly [SPA] and vice-chairman of the Committee for the 
Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland [CPRF], Chong Chun-ki, 
chairman of the Committee for Cultural Relations with Foreign 
Countries and vice-chairman of the CPRF, and other officials 
concerned. 
  Memorial addresses were made by Chairman of the North side 
headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's 
Reunification [Pomminnyon] Paek In-chun, director of the 
secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of 
the Fatherland Paek Nam-chun and member of the C.C., the North 
side headquarters of the National Alliance of Youth and Students 
for the Country's Reunification [Pomchonghangnyon] Choe Yong-hui. 
  They said the life of the late Rev. Mun, the fallen patriot, 
was the life of an admirable paoriotic-minded person who devoted 
his all to the struggle for independence, democracy and 
reunification and the life of a reunification champion who made 
a breakthrough on the barrier of national division with the 
devotion of his whole body and who kindled a fierce flame of 
reunification in the hearts of the compatriots at home and 
abroad. His death is a big loss to our nation, they noted. 
  They recalled that the pastor hailed and supported the 
proposal for convening a North-South political consultative 
conference to discusy the confederacy formula of reunification 
which was put forward by the great leader President Kim Il-song 
in his New Year address for 1989, visited Pyongyang in March 
that year and was received by the great leader, after which he 
renewed his patriotic faith and will for reunfication and, back 
in South Korea, he did not cease his struggle behind bars. 
  By refusing a Seoul trip of our mourners' group on the death 
of the late Mun, the South Korean authorities stripped 
themselves naked to the world, revealing their true color as 
fascist dictators and a group of barbarians who have totally 
thrown away human morality and the "civilian" mask, they said. 
  They stressed that, though the Rev. Mun passed away, his 
patriotic spirit for reunification will remain in the hearts of 
our people and the day of national reunification longed for by 
him will come certainly. 
  A poet Pak Se-ok recited a poem "To the Memory of Rev. Mun 
Ik-hwan" and people's actor Yi Tan read a poem written by the 
late Rev. Mun at the memorial service.

according to Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation [VNS]. 
  Choe Ung-mo, an ex-journalist in Chongno District, Seoul, 
said the New Year address of respected President Kim Il-song 
gives a new hope and confidence to the people in the South who 
are yearning after the North under the politics centring on the 
masses as a beacon of hope. 
  The group of traitors is resorting to vicious slanders and 
smear propaganda against the North in a bid to stop the minds of 
the people in the South from turning toward the North, but the 
people in the South stubbornly fight for the day when they will 
live under the administration of the president, looking up to 
the North, an earthly paradise of the working people, as a 
beacon of hope, he added. 
  Yi Myong-chol, a peasant in Puchon, pointed out that the 
peasants in the South failed in farming because of man-made 
calamities and, still worse, had to give up farming because the 
"president" opened rice market to the Yankees. 
  I heard the news that last year a bumper harvest visited the 
North under the sagacious agricultural policy of President Kim 
Il-song and, no doubt, this year, too, a bumper harvest will 
visit the North thanks to the agriculture-first policy set forth 
by the president, he noted, adding that the earnest wish of the 
peasants in the South is to do farming to their heart's content 
under the care of respected President Kim Il-song who is 
pursuing the best agricultural policy in the world. 
  A dissident Yi Sang-o in Kwangju said the proposal for 
achieving reunification by means of confederacy reclarified by 
President Kim Il-song in his New Year address is a banner for 
the reunification movement that the Korean nation should hold 
aloft. 
  There is no alternative but reunification by means of 
confederacy, the way of reunification which is acceptable to 
anyone under the present situation in Korea and this formula of 
reunification is the most fair and aboveboard and most 
realistic, best one, he said. 
  He vowed to devote his wisdom and energies to the struggle 
to 
reunify the country by means of confederacy as taught by 
President Kim Il-song.

<F P=106> ["War Trumpeting Inciting Confrontation" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 22 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Yong- sam, when receiving "this year's working plan" of the 
puppet Ministry of Defence on January 20, cried that "the combat 
capabilities" of the puppet Army "should be increased" to cope 
with "the provocation of the North", according to a radio report 
from Seoul. 
  The puppet defence minister there blared that "a perfect 
combat posture of the Army will be taken to deal with armed 
provocation" of the North. 
  The South Korean puppets revealed their scheme to hurt 
fellow 
countrymen with arms, shouting themselves hoarse for "the 
completion of military posture" and "an immediate retaliation" 
from the beginning of the year. This shows that they will not 
hesitate to light the fuse of war to slay fellow countrymen. It 
must not be overlooked here that the traitor, maliciously 
charging the North with its fictitious "nuclear issue" again, 
spun out the malicious trash that the North "refuses to give up 
nuclear development" because it "has not abandoned its lingering 
desire for unification through communization and unification 
with arms." 
  This is a despicable ruse of the traitor to justify armed 
provocations of his group on the pretext of the North's 
"nuclear issue". 
  Making consistent efforts for peace of the country and its 
peaceful reunification, the North put forward the 10-point 
programme of the great unity of the whole nation and a proposal 
for the exchange of special envoys to discuss and resolve 
outstanding questions between the North and the South. The 
South Korean puppets, however, are following a road of 
dependence on foreign forces and North-South confrontation, 
shunning them. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group must stop running wild, mindful of 
the 
irrevocable consequences of its reckless war racket and increase 
of tensions.

Councils (Sochongnyon) of South Korea met on January 15 and 
issued a resolution for checking rice market opening, 
Seoul-based Christian Broadcasting System reported. 
  Accusing the present regime of bowing to the U.S. pressure 
for rice import liberalization, the resolution called for 
blocking the "parliamentary ratification" of rice market opening. 
  The ralliers also denounced the authorities' opening of the 
financial market. 
  They declared they would wage a vigorous struggle against 
the 
U.S. pressure for market opening.

<F P=106> ["Water Pollution Under Corrupt Politics" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 18 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
denounces the crime of the Kim Yong-sam clique in causing the 
pollution of the Naktong river. 
  The commentary titled "water pollution under corrupt 
politics" notes that more than ten million people in Pusan and 
North and South Kyongsang Provinces of South Korea are suffering 
from a shortage of drinking water because the Naktong River is 
seriously contaminated with ammonia nitrogen and carcinogenic 
benzene, toluene and other toxic substances. 
  The news analyst says: 
  The Kim Yong-sam clique, much upset, is resorting to petty 
tricks to lull the resentment of the people, sending "a 
fact-finding team" to the spot and publishing "a message of 
apology to the people" in the name of the puppet prime minister. 
On the other hand, it is working hard to shirk the blame for 
the drinking water problem. 
  Such hide-and-seek of the puppets, however, can work on 
nobody at all. [sentence as received] 
  The South Korean people know only too well it is the Kim 
Yong-sam clique that has received thick bundles of banknotes 
from pollution-causing comprador businesses and connived at 
their dumping of toxic waste water into the Naktong River. 
  Under corrupt politics, nature and society become sick and 
degenerated. 
  With nothing can the Kim Yong-sam clique conceal its 
treacherous acts in turning South Korea into "the worst hell of 
pollution in the world" and imposing sufferings and misfortunes 
on the people.

KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 17 (KCNA) -- South Korean people 
are looking up to the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the 
lodestar of the nation and reunification. 
  A newspaper reporter in Seoul, while having a conversation 
with his colleagues about the situation, said: European and 
American big powers are conspiring with each other in putting 
pressure upon North Korea under the pretext of the fictitious 
"nuclear issue" in an attempt to stifle the socialist system of 
the North, but the North is braving it. 
  The North is demonstrating the might of the Republic 
entirely 
thanks to the outstanding guidance of the leader Kim Chong-il, 
the great statesman, he noted, adding: 
  The leader Kim Chong-il who has literary and military 
accomplishments is an iron-willed brilliant commander with firm 
faith, a distinguished great politician with correct judgment 
and outstanding leadership ability and a prominent leader of the 
international socialist movement who is guiding the movement for 
rebuilding socialism, standing in the centre of world politics. 
  A university professor in Seoul told his students: Mr. Kim 
Chong-il is a man with gifted qualification. He is not only a 
great man of learning, a great master of idea and theory but a 
master of political art who is leading people to social progress 
by applying knowledge and theory. This is eloquently proved by 
the course of dramatic changes in political, economic and 
cultural domains of the North. 
  It is good luck of our fellow countrymen to have held such a 
peerless great man as Mr. Kim Chong-il in high esteem as the 
lodestar of the nation. 
  A certain Yi in Kangso District, Seoul, told his villagers: 
I firmly believe that as Mr. Kim Chong-il looks after our 
people, the country would be reunified before long and people 
would be well off under his leadership. It is General Kim 
Il-song and Mr. Kim Chong-il who we should believe and follow.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 19 (KCNA) -- The New Year address 
of the great leader President Kim Il-song was reported by 
foreign media. 
  The Libyan paper AL JAHAF AL AHDAR carried part of his New 
Year address elucidating a solution of the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula. 
  The paper noted in the preface that the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula is related to the maneuvers of the United 
States. 
  Last year the U.S. and its followers, it said, led the 
situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war by 
inventing the "suspicion of nuclear development by North Korea" 
in an attempt to stifle Korean-style socialism centred on the 
masses. 
  However, the Korean people who have experienced the 
superiority of socialism to capitalism through their life rose 
as one to defend their choice, gains, national dignity, the 
country and its independence and countered the moves of the 
enemy by declaring withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty and a semi-war state, the paper pointed out, and added: 
  Their response was an unexpected, surprising blow to the 
provokers. 
  The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula can cover be 
solved 
by means of pressure and threat. 
  The New Year address was also reported by newspapers and 
radios of India, Zambia, the Netherlands, Britain, Nepal, China, 
Burundi, Guyana, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Yemen. 
  The Cameroonian paper LE CHEMIN carried the full text of the 
address.

to sexual slaves for the "imperial Army" and violating them and 
brutally [word indistinct] them were the most heinous crimes 
without precedent, said the paper. 
  The "comfort women" issue can by no means be buried in

  The main point in the solution of the issue is for Japan to

public its results and make an honest apology and adequate 
compensation, the paper stressed.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "He Is Endlessly Glorifying History of </F>
Great Upsurge in Socialist Construction"] 
  [Text] At the 21st plenary session of the Sixth Party 
Central Committee, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, 
recalling with deep emotion the historic days when the great 
Chollima upsurge was registered in our country, taught that we 
should vigorously advance by adding the speed of the nineties to 
the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance displayed at the time. 
  In the New Year address, he designated this year as the year 
of revolutionary turn when socialist construction in our country 
will enter a new development stage, and as the year of rewarding 
struggle for the entire party, the whole country and all people 
to effect a great revolutionary upsurge on all fronts by fully 
mobilizing themselves. 
  Seeing the spirit of struggle of party members and working 
people, who have risen in the rewarding struggle to effect a 
new, great upsurge, we again realize that the great Chollima 
upsurge, which the great leader personally initiated, has been 
led to a constant upsurge thanks to the energetic leadership of 
the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. We recall these proud 
annals of our revolution with emotion. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il, the dear leader of our party and 
people, has indicated: We should effect a great upsurge and a 
great leap in socialist construction by upholding the 
revolutionary banner of the chuche idea--the red banner of 
revolution. Thus, we should resolutely break the spearhead of 
the enemy's attack which is directed at us and should fully 
demonstrate the true nature of chuche Korea and the might of 
socialism. 
  When we look back upon the history of great upsurges in 
socialist construction, we come to recall, first of all, the 
great Chollima upsurge. Initiated under the wise leadership of 
the great leader, the consistently carried out great Chollima 
march brought about great reform, in cataclysmic change, by 
compressing time, and opened a great era of prosperity and 
development. 
  The dear comrade leader said during his visit to the land of 
Kangson during the initial stages of the great Chollima upsurge, 
that he was greatly encouraged by all that he had heard about 
the resolution of the working class, and that he firmly believes 
that the working class in Kangson will repay the great leader's 
lofty trust and expectations without fail. 
  While assisting the leadership of the great leader who 
constantly gave on-the-spot guidance, the dear comrade leader 
was keenly aware of the loyalty of the working class to the 
party throughout the country and of the boundless creative power 
of the popular masses. Thus, he consolidated the will to 
constantly succeed with the history of great upsurge on this 
land. 
  The will cherished by the dear comrade leader when the 
tradition of great revolutionary upsurge was provided in our 
country has been embodied as refined leadership from the late 
1960's to the present. As a result, great upsurges were 
constantly created in the history of socialist construction in 
our country. 
  To cope with the extremely strained situation in the later 
part of the 1960's, the great leader put forward the line of 
simultaneously advancing economic construction and national 
defense construction. During that time, the dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong- il wisely led the struggle to effect a new great 
revolutionary upsurge in socialist construction. 
  While meeting with functionaries of science and education 
department of the party Central Committee in June 1967, the dear 
comrade leader gave scientific answers to theoretical and 
practical problems raised in socialist economic construction in 
a statement on correctly comprehending political and moral 
stimulation [chaguk] and material stimulation. The dear comrade 
leader gave the scientific explanation that in a socialist 
society, priority should be given to political and moral 
stimulation, that this stimulation should be supported by 
material stimulation, and that in socialist society, importance 
should be attached to speed above all else, so that speed is 
regarded as the basic factor. As a result, an ideological and 
theoretical guideline enabling us to effect a new great 
revolutionary upsurge in all domains of economic construction 
and national defense construction was provided. 
  In July 1967, the dear comrade leader expounded upon the 
direction of ideological work to inspire all people to the great 
upsurge. He emphasized that all functionaries and workers 
should highly display the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance 
and arduous struggle, vigorously wage the technological 
revolution by producing to the maximum and saving to the 
maximum, and more actively carry out the Chollima workteam 
movement. 
  In July 1967, while giving guidance to the work of Kangson 
steel plant, dear comrade leader became aware of the lofty 
revolutionary zeal of the working class. As soon as he returned 
to the party Central Committee that day, he prepared militant 
slogans, including "Let us effect a great revolutionary upsurge 
once again by continuously accelerating the great Chollima 
march," and encouraged functionaries of the party Central 
Committee to go down to the lower echelons to carry out 
political work with these slogans. 
  Visiting the working class in Yongsong in August 1967, dear 
comrade leader concretely explained the essence and significance 
of the party's new policy for effecting a great revolutionary 
upsurge. He encouraged and inspired the working class in 
Yongsong to advance at the van of the great revolutionary 
upsurge by proudly cherishing deep trust by the great leader. 
  Thanks to the wise leadership of dear comrade leader, the 
flames of the great revolutionary upsurge, which were set ablaze 
by the great leader among the working class in Yongsong, became 
more fiercely aflame across the country, and a new great upsurge 
was effected on all fronts of economic construction and national 
defense construction. 
  Our revolution, facing a new period in the 1970's, was 
raised 
onto a high stage when the slogan on remodeling the entire 
society on the chuche idea was put forward and implemented and 
socialist construction was developed into a great majestic 
battle. 
  This reality urgently raised the demand not only for firmly 
maintaining the already accomplished revolutionary upsurge in 
socialist construction, but also for enhancing it to an even 
higher stage. 
  With uncommon wisdom and scientific insight, dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il keenly realized the matured demand of 
revolutionary development and revolutionary aspirations of the 
popular masses. By putting forward a unique and outstanding idea 
on the speed battle, he vigorously inspired the entire party, 
the whole country, and all the people to the march of the speed 
battle -- a new general march for victory in the great socialist 
construction battle. 
  The speed battle is a basic combat formula to push ahead 
with 
all works in a lightning manner and is a revolutionary principle 
for implementation of work. The basic demand of the speed 
battle is to push for work with maximum speed by mobilizing all 
forces and to ensure the high-quality of the work. The basic 
method for vigorously carrying out the speed battle is to push 
ahead vigorously with the ideological and technological 
revolution and to support organizational guidance work. Let us 
all rise in the speed battle. 
  Since ideas and theories pertaining to the speed battle and 
the party's slogans containing such ideas and theories were put 
forward, the history of the great upsurge in socialist 
construction in our country, which proudly decorated the fifties 
and the sixties with the great Chollima march, became more 
brilliant in the seventies with the majestic march of the speed 
battle. 
  The march of the speed battle was a new march of our people 
who accelerated socialist construction by pushing ahead with all 
work in a lightning manner and with incomparable speed, which 
was more speedy than the hurricane-like speed of the era of 
great Chollima upsurge. This march was a great all-people march, 
which advanced with uncommon speed and with the spirit of adding 
the speed battle to Chollima. 
  With the beginning of the majestic march of the speed 
battle, 
our socialist construction effected a new upsurge. The flames of 
the speed battle enabled us to create a new Chollima speed, such 
as the speed of 70-day battle, and to register a miracle of 
accomplishing the six-year national economic plan far ahead of 
schedule. 
  The flames of the speed battle fiercely blazed in the 
eighties, and enabled us to build on this land everlasting 
monumental creations throughout the country, including a 
10,000-ton press in Yongsong, a large-size oxygen separator in 
Nagwon, the Tower of Chuche Idea, the Gate of Triumph, the Great 
People's Study Hall, Changgwang Street, Samchong Square in 
Komdok, and Sohae Lockgate. 
  The policy of the speed battle, whose might has already been 
displayed through practice, is demonstrating greater vitality 
every day. The bugle sound of the speed battle has become a 
powerful force of pushing for the struggle to achieve the 
party's revolutionary economic strategy. 
  The great revolutionary upsurge, which our people should 
effect to achieve brilliantly the party's revolutionary economic 
strategy; and the great revolutionary upsurge, which our people 
should create anew with the might of the single-hearted unity 
and with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, is the 
optimistic and trustworthy revolutionary upsurge due to the 
iron-clad will and refined leadership of the dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il, who is a genius of revolution and construction. 
  Just as our people effected the great Chollima upsurge by 
upholding the lofty intention and wise leadership of the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song, a new great revolutionary upsurge 
will be effected on this land without fail, because of the might 
of the people who are firmly united with the dear comrade leader. 
  Thus, we will smash antisocialist maneuvers of the enemy and 
will demonstrate to the entire world once again the firmness and 
might of popular mass-centered socialism of our own style.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 18 (KCNA) -- The desire of the 
popular masses to live in a free and peaceful world, freed from 
domination and subjugation, exploitation and oppression, can be 
realized only through the cause of independence of the popular 
masses, the cause of socialism, says NODONG SINMUN in an article 
today. The article headlined "Guarantee for Moving Up Bright 
Future of Mankind" reads in part: 
  The great leader President Kim Il-song in his New Year 
address said if the progressive people of the world promote 
historical development by strengthening their unity and 
solidarity under the banner of independence against imperialism, 
they shall soon be able to shape a bright future for humanity. 
  The imperialists are now intensifying political, economic 
and 
military pressure to stifle the countries going forward under 
the banner of socialism and are intensifying their maneuverings 
to dominate and interfere in the affairs of the developing 
countries aspiring after socialism. 
  To strengthen unity and solidarity is a firm guarantee for 
the world progressive people to smash the imperialists' moves. 
It stands out with greater urgency because the imperialist 
reactionaries are becoming undisguised in their attempt to beat 
one by one the progressive countries advancing toward 
independence, sovereignty and socialism. 
  Unity and solidarity are a most powerful weapon for the 
cause 
of independence, the cause of socialism, and a decisive 
guarantee for victory. To strengthen it, it is essential to 
adhere to the principle of independence, equality and mutual 
respect. 
  It is necessary to strengthen the unity and solidarity of 
the 
revolutionary parties struggling for the victory of the cause of 
independence, the cause of socialism, of the popular masses. 
  The Pyongyang declaration serves as a banner under which 
international unity and solidarity can be strengthened in the 
struggle for socialism. 
  Independence, peace and friendship are the basic idea of the 
foreign policy of the Workers' Party of Korea and the Government 
of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
  The Korean people value their unity and solidarity with all 
the progressive people of the world aspiring after 
independence, sovereignty and socialism and will, in the future, 
too, give strong impetus to the trend of history by 
strengthening unity and solidarity with them.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Single-hearted Unity Is a Decisive </F>
Guarantee for Victory in the March This Year"] 
  [Text] The entire country is filled with the heightened 
revolutionary ardor of party members and workers who are 
participating in the combat in the new year in hearty response 
to the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year address. 
  A decisive guarantee for victory in the march this year is 
to 
defend our rock-solid single-hearted unity around the party and 
the leader [suryong] as the most precious thing and demonstrate 
the might of this unity more highly. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: We must 
defend the single-hearted unity of our revolutionary ranks, 
which has been consolidated rock-solid under our party's 
leadership, as the most precious thing and further consolidate 
and develop it. 
  Single-hearted unity is our revolution's immortal, honorable 
tradition and a great banner of victory. Our people have been 
able to victoriously overcome all difficulties and trials on the 
revolutionary road and march forward and build a powerful 
independent, self-sufficient socialist country capable of self- 
reliant defense in this land because they have waged struggles 
like heroes after strongly uniting around the party and the 
leader [suryong]. 
  Last year, when stern trials faced the fatherland and 
reunification, our people honorably defended the socialist 
fatherland's dignity and safety and won a great victory in 
socialist economic construction. This was possible because 
there was the might of single-hearted unity. 
  Only when we resolutely defend the honorable tradition of 
single-hearted unity and continuously and highly demonstrate its 
might, can we fully demonstrate the superiority of socialism of 
our own style and complete the chuche-oriented socialist cause 
to the end in any storm. 
  More strongly consolidating single-hearted unity among our 
revolutionary ranks is all the more important a demand in 
connection with our revolution's environment and our massive 
tasks. The imperialists and reactionaries are strengthening 
their offensives on an unprecedented scale in the political, 
economic, military, and diplomatic fields and all other fields 
to isolate, stifle, and crush [korip chilsik apsal] our 
Republic, which is marching under the uplifted banner of 
socialism. The situation in our country is still tense and 
complicated because of the enemy's anti-Republic, antisocialist 
maneuvers, and numerous difficulties face us. We must fly the 
banner of single-hearted unity more highly if we are to score 
revolutionary upsurges by waging the struggle to thoroughly 
implement the party's revolutionary economic strategies under 
these circumstances. 
  Single-hearted unity is a source of the vitality of 
socialism. When our people implement our party's revolutionary 
economic strategies after strongly uniting around the party and 
the leader [suryong], the imperialists' anti-Republic, 
antisocialist commotions will quiet down, and our people will be 
able defend and maintain socialism of our own style and glorify 
it to the end. 
  The tasks of all fields of socialist construction this year 
are heavy and massive. As the great leader has elucidated in 
his New Year's address, we must thoroughly implement the 
revolutionary lines of self-dependence, self-support, and 
self-reliant defense to comply with the prevailing situation and 
the requirements for the development of our revolution. They 
must also vigorously carry out the three revolutions, 
ideological, technological, and cultural, to further strengthen 
the country's political, economic, and military might. 
  Our party's revolutionary economic strategies presented at 
the 21st plenary meeting of the Sixth party Central Committee 
are the most just and revolutionary lines for consolidating a 
basis for a self-reliant rock-solid national economy and further 
improving the standard of living to meet socialist demands. 
When we thoroughly implement these strategies, we will be able 
to more vigorously demonstrate the superiority of socialism of 
our own style and take new attack bases for conquering higher 
peaks in socialism. 
  We must continuously and strongly adhere to the 
agriculture-first policy, the light industry-first policy, and 
the foreign trade-first policy this year. We must also give top 
priority to the coal industry, the power industry, and railway 
transportation, which are the leading sectors of the people's 
economy, and continuously develop the metallurgical industry. 
They must also achieve new development in all fields of 
socialist cultural construction and exert due efforts to 
strengthen the country's defensive capability in response to the 
enemy's war provocation maneuvers. 
  If we are to implement these massive tasks successfully, we 
must defend our single-hearted unity as the most precious thing 
and more highly demonstrate its might. Our single-hearted unity 
is single- hearted unity in ideology and in action in which the 
entire party and all the people absolutely worship [sungbae] and 
follow the great leader [suryong], and the great leader 
[yongdoja]. 
  When we highly display the might of such great 
single-hearted unity unprecedented in history, there will be no 
difficulty that we cannot overcome or stronghold that we cannot 
occupy. 
  The road to destroying in every step vicious anti-Republic 
and antisocialist maneuvers of the imperialists and 
reactionaries and the road to highly demonstrating the spirit of 
chuche Korea are to highly display the might of single-hearted 
unity. The road to consolidating the foundation of the nation's 
self-supporting economy by vigorously accelerating the socialist 
general march is for all people to struggle with single-hearted 
unity with the party. 
  The idea on further strengthening the single-hearted unity 
of 
our revolutionary ranks, expounded by the great leader Comrade 
Kim Il-song in the New Year's address, is a precious guideline 
that provided a decisive guarantee for victory of this year's 
combat. 
  This idea reflects the great leader's lofty intent to make 
this year the year of historic turn in the revolution and 
construction in our country by more highly displaying the might 
of our single-hearted unity, which the entire party, all the 
people and the whole Army have attained by firmly rallying 
themselves behind the great leader [yongdoja]. 
  All party members and working people should further 
consolidate and develop our single-hearted unity in conformity 
with the demand of the prevailing situation and development of 
the revolution, and should brilliantly achieve the militant 
tasks elucidated by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in the 
New Year's address. Thus, we should register greater victory in 
the struggle to advance the socialist cause of our own style. 
  It is important, above all, for all party members and 
working 
people to deeply realize the greatness of the leader [yongdoja] 
and to have thoroughgoing faith to absolutely trust and follow 
only their leader [suryong] and their leader [yongdoja] under 
any circumstance. 
  The might of the unity of the revolutionary ranks is the 
might of solid faith of all people toward the leader. Comrade 
Kim Chong-il, our dear leader, is the matchlessly great man who 
has both literary and military achievements and who has loyalty 
and filial piety. He is destiny and future of our fatherland, 
our people and our-style socialism. 
  Through proud realities of our revolution, which advances 
without wavering even a slight degree in the midst of worldwide 
upheaval, all party members and working people should be keenly 
aware of how the great leader [yongdoja] we are upholding is at 
the van of the party, the revolutionary ranks and revolutionary 
armed forces. 
  We should uphold the dear comrade leader with loyalty and 
filial piety by cherishing the iron-clad belief that because 
there is the leader [yongdoja], there is the nation, and their 
own happiness and everlasting prosperity of the future 
generations are insured. 
  The great chuche idea is an ideological basis of our 
single-hearted unity. All the people should firmly insure 
consistency of their ideologies and actions in accordance with 
the demand of the chuche idea. Herein lies the invincible might 
of our single-hearted unity. 
  Deeply realizing that the chuche idea is the life of 
our-style socialism, party members and working people should 
more firmly arm themselves with the chuche idea. Our 
single-hearted unity is a powerful driving force in socialist 
construction, and its might should be fully demonstrated in the 
practical struggle to accelerate the socialist economic 
construction. 
  In today's rewarding struggle to further consolidate the 
foundation of the nation's self-supporting economy, to upgrade 
the people's standard of living, and to hold a new offensive 
position to occupy a higher height of socialism, we should fully 
display the might of our people's firm unity with the party and 
the leader [suryong]. 
  By highly displaying the sense of unbounded devotion to the 
party and to the revolution and the revolutionary spirit of 
self-reliance and arduous struggle, all party members and 
workers should timely fulfill and without fail national economic 
plans assigned to them. 
  For us to glorify our-style socialism with the might of 
single-hearted unity, we should more brilliantly bloom the 
communist fine custom overflowing in the whole society. The 
revolutionary traits of our people, who are firmly united as one 
with the party and the leader, should be vigorously demonstrated 
in highly displaying the communist fine custom, in which all 
members of society help and lead each other according to the 
collectivist principle, "One for all, all for one." 
  The single-hearted unity is our most powerful weapon and 
strength in defending, protecting and accomplishing our-style 
socialism to the end. As long as there are the wise leadership 
of the party and the leader, and the single-hearted unity of the 
people, who are rallied behind the great leader [suryong] and 
great leader [yongdoja], there is nothing that we should be 
afraid of in this world. 
  All party members and working people should advance by more 
highly upholding the banner of single-hearted unity with sense 
of confidence and courage. Thus, we should again demonstrate the 
unswerving spirit of heroic Korea in this year's socialist 
general march.

and workteams of industrial establishments and farmers of 
cooperative farms in Korea held meetings to vow to implement to 
the letter the militant tasks set forth by the great leader 
President Kim Il-song in his New Year address. 
  The speakers said that the New Year address of President Kim 
Il-song is a highly important guideline to which the Korean 
people should hold fast this year. They called for stepping up 
the general onward march of socialism in the revolutionary 
spirit of self- reliance and hard struggle by further 
strengthening the might of singlehearted unity. 
  They said that they would successfully fulfil this year's 
plans for socialist economic construction by making continued 
innovations and uninterrupted advance in the spirit of Chollima 
spurred on by the "speed of the '90s" under the militant slogan 
"Let us hasten the general march of socialism in the 
revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude". 
  They declared that they would, with unfailing loyalty to the 
party and the leader, make continued innovations and 
uninterrupted advance in the fighting spirit which was displayed 
during the rigorous war and in the same spirit and stamina with 
which they brought about a great upsurge of Chollima in the 
difficult post-war period and thus make 1994 a year of 
historical advance in the Korean revolution and construction.

<F P=106> ["Korea Pervaded With Feelings of Kinship" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 17 (KCNA) -- A beautiful 
communist morality has come into full bloom in Korea where many 
people have brought home and taken good care of orphaned 
children and old folks with no one to rely upon like their real 
parents and real sons and daughters. 
  Last year, An Kwang-nam, a worker of the Kangso District 
coal 
mining complex, Chong Myong-il, a worker of the Uiju County 
urban management office in North Pyongan Province, and many 
other people adopted orphaned children and brought home lonely 
old men and women and took utmost care of them. 
  The great leader President Kim Il-song, long ago, put 
forward 
the slogan "One for all and all for one!" and has made sure that 
a beautiful communist morality of helping and leading each other 
forward pervades the whole country. 
  At the national meeting of mothers held in November 1961 he 
highly estimated Yi Yong-suk, a woman in Sunchon City, South 
Pyongan Province, who adopted and brought up nine war orphans 
during the fatherland liberation war, saying her example should 
be generalized throughout the country, and saw to it that the 
title of labour heroine was awarded to her. 
  Kim Hui-chong, a labour heroine living in Taetan County, 
South Hwanghae Province, brought up 15 children of fallen 
fighters to be reliable officials of the country. 
  Kim Yun-yong, principal of the Pyongyang Sangdang Primary 
School, Yi Hwa-yong, secretary of the primary party committee of 
the welfare cooperative in Waudo District, Nampo municipality, 
Wi Hwak-sil, a resident in Kumchon County, North Hwanghae 
Province, Hwang Pi-pong, a worker of the Nahung washing machine 
factory in Iwon County, South Hamgyong Province, and many others 
also became parents of orphaned children and brought home and 
look after old men and women with no one to support them. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il highly estimated their 
deeds and sent benevolent gifts to them. Last year, he praised 
as a very good party worker and extended thanks to Chang 
Sa-hong, secretary of the primary party committee of an organ 
under the General Bureau of Western Railways, who had taken warm 
care of the son and daughter of a worker who died, giving more 
thought to them than to his own children. 
  Indeed, there is not a single orphan, not a single lonely 
old 
person in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea where the 
leader, the party and the masses are united in one mind and the 
entire people form one big family.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 19 (KCNA) -- Buddhist masses for 
national reunification were held at temples throughout the 
country today on the day of Buddha's attainment of great wisdom. 
  The masses were attended by monks of the temples, believers 
and clergymen from the Central Committee of the Korean Buddhists 
Federation and its provincial, city and county committees. 
  The preachers said that in order to realise the idea of 
"getting rid of the pain and attaining happiness," the basic 
idea of Buddhists, it was imperative to reunify the country at 
an early date. 
  They stressed that the country should be reunified in the 
form of a confederation and the best way to it was to implement 
"10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for 
the reunification of the country" laid down by respected 
President Kim Il-song. 
  They called on all the Buddhists in the North, South and 
overseas to closely unite with each other under the banner of 
great national unity and make a tangible contribution to the 
cause of national reunification, thus achieving the 
reunification in the '90s without fail.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 15 (KCNA) -- The electric power 
producers in Korea are boosting the output to carry out the task 
put forward by the great leader President Kim Il-song in his New 
Year address. 
  According to data available at the State Commission of the 
Electric Power Industry, the electric power outfit in the first 
ten days of this month was 11.8 percent above that in the same 
period of last month -- a gain of 18 percent at the thermal 
power plants and 80,000 kwh at the hydraulic power stations. 
  The Pukchang thermal power complex has lifted its electric 
power output 74,000 kwh on a daily average in the new year above 
that in the same period of last month by tightening the links 
between processes and operating every generator at full capacity. 
  The Pyongyang thermal power complex and the Sunchon thermal 
power plant raised the output of steam and power in the latest 
ten days more than 20 percent above the same period of last 
month by improving the technical management of the equipment. 
  The Kanggye Youth, Changjingang, Hochongang and other 
hydraulic power stations keep a high and steady rate in 
production through better adjustment of the generating equipment 
and increase of the efficiency of the turbines.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 14 (KCNA) -- The final damming 
project on the Chongsu Islet tideland was completed successfully 
in Korea in the new year. 
  The nature-remaking project is to reclaim 1,000 hectares of 
land by building a dam linking Sikyo-ri, Chongsu Islet and 
Tungam-ri in Kangyong County, South Hwanghae Province. 
  The project has increased the area of cultivated land and 
changed the coastline and looks of the country. 
  The builders of the South Hwanghae Provincial Chongdan 
General Tideland Reclamation Enterprise who were in charge of 
the project had overfulfilled the daily plan by more than 70 
percent on an average in the whole period of the project by 
boosting the utility rate of transport means and actively 
introducing new construction methods.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 23 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii faced stronger pressure Sunday [23 January] over the 
ongoing "framework" trade talks than other issues from U.S. 
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, a senior Finance Ministry 
official said. Bentsen "seemed to be placing heavy weight on 
the framework talks," said Takatoshi Kato, director of the 
ministry's international finance bureau, briefing reporters 
after a one-hour meeting between Fujii and Bentsen. 
  But, Kato stressed that "no specific requests" were made by 
Bentsen, including any reference to "numerical targets," and the 
two sides just "confirmed commitments for further progress" to 
make the February 11 Japan-U.S. summit in Washington 
"successful." 
  Fujii, speaking to reporters as he left the meeting, said he 
and Bentsen agreed to try to conclude bilateral talks in time. 
  On Japan's economy, Fujii said he told Bentsen that Japan is 
trying to take steps to boost the economy, despite the turmoil 
in the wake of the upper house's rejection Friday of the 
government-proposed political reform bills. "Please trust us," 
he said to Bentsen. 
  The two leaders did not discuss specifics of planned 
Japanese 
economic-stimulus measures, such as a much-discussed income tax 
cut, Fujii noted of the meeting, also attended by Ambassador 
Walter Mondale and Lawrence Summers, Treasury undersecretary for 
international affairs. 
  Bentsen and Summers declined comment as they left. Bentsen 
said he will comment at a news conference after he meets Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa at 4 P.M. 
  Fujii vowed "serious and vigorous efforts" to launch a 
new stimulus package including tax cuts, and explained that a 
joint economic forum of the government and coalition parties 
will continue discussing tax issues to come up with an 
"acceptable decision," Kato said. 
  Bentsen expressed "hopes on contributions to spur domestic 
demand," Kato said. 
  On the upper house's failure to pass the political reform 
bills, Fujii sought support for Japan placing priority on the 
measures by explaining the latest surveys showed public support 
for reform and that Japan intends to focus on reviving the bills 
for passage over the next week before the current Diet session 
closes on Saturday, Kato said. 
  Referring to reported possible postponement of the 
Hosokawa-Clinton talks, Kato stressed that the financial leaders 
based their talks on the February 11 summit as scheduled. 
  Fujii and Bentsen also reconfirmed their cooperation for a 
"successful" meeting of finance ministers of the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum slated for March 18 and 19 in 
Hawaii, Kato said, noting they did not discuss specifics. 
  The two leaders also agreed on further support toward Russia 
and its reform, he said. No new support measures were 
discussed, but Bentsen voiced concern over the recent cabinet 
reshuffle there, Kato said. 
  Bentsen stopped over in Tokyo on his way back home from 
Russian and Asian tours and had requested the meetings with 
Fujii and Hosokawa. 
  The meetings came during a crucial time for the Japanese 
Government which failed to pass the political reform bills 
through the upper house and attention is fixed on what Japan 
will offer to the U.S.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 23 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa responded to high-level U.S. trade pressure Sunday [23 
January] by hinting he may override bureaucrats to secure a 
breakthrough in bilateral talks. U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen turned up the heat in a visit to Tokyo, vowing that the 
United States may "reexamine" the stalled bilateral trade 
"framework" talks if no agreement is reached before a Japan-U.S. 
summit on February 11 in Washington. 
  Hosokawa told Bentsen that "if the time comes for a 
political 
decision, I hope to apply leadership, making efforts to improve" 
the outcome of the talks, according to a Japanese official who 
attended the half-hour talks at the prime minister's official 
residence. 
  Bentsen told reporters that Washington "will not settle for 
any cosmetic agreement" on trade and that "if we do not have 
credible agreements by the time of the summit, we would have to 
reexamine the basis of the framework." 
  "We would far prefer no agreements to weak agreements," he 
said. Bentsen said his remarks were not meant as a threat but 
were "just the logical consequence," reflecting "the realities 
of the situation." 
  Hosokawa told Bentsen he hopes for "satisfactory results" to 
the talks, noting subcabinet-level meetings begin this coming 
week to discuss the matter "more deeply," according to Takatoshi 
Kato, head of the Finance Ministry's international finance 
bureau. 
  Both sides remain far apart in the talks, which seek to 
expand access to the Japanese market in such areas as insurance, 
government procurement and automobiles and auto parts. 
  Japan blasts as "managed trade" U.S. efforts to set 
standards 
such as market shares to mark progress. But U.S. officials have 
accused Japanese negotiators of foot-dragging and called for 
political leaders to go over the bureaucrats' heads. 
  Bentsen reiterated at a press conference that "we have to 
have indicators to show if we're making progress or not in 
opening markets." 
  Bentsen said President Bill Clinton asked him to add the 
hastily arranged trade talks with Hosokawa and an earlier 
hour-long session with Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii to the 
end of a lengthy trip to Russia and Asia. 
  Both sides also said Japan reaffirmed its commitment to take 
steps to spur its slumping economy. 
  "We said very strongly that we want a major stimulus package 
and that it be a sustained one," Bentsen told reporters, adding 
that a short-term stimulus, such as an income tax cut offset 
with a quick hike in the consumption tax, is "not effective." 
  Fujii vowed "serious and vigorous efforts" to launch "a new 
economic stimulus package, including tax cuts," and said a forum 
of the government and ruling coalition parties will continue 
seeking an "acceptable decision" on tax issues, according to the 
ministry's Kato. 
  Fujii told reporters that he asked Bentsen to "please trust 
us" to try to boost the economy in the wake of the upper house's 
rejection Friday of the government-proposed political reform 
package. But Japanese officials said that Bentsen and the 
Japanese leaders did not discuss details of a tax cut or other 
measures. 
  Hosokawa sought support for his attempt to "pin efforts on 
political reform bills over the next week" because they are 
supported by the public and that the passage would have 
"favorable economic effects," Kato said, adding that Bentsen 
made "no specific requests." 
  Bentsen told reporters he appreciated that Japanese leaders 
are "pushing" to craft stimulus measures and reach a trade 
agreement. "They said they're ready to go ahead," despite the 
current political turmoil, he said. 
  He declined to comment on the "local political situation," 
except to say that Hosokawa "has his work before him." 
  Bentsen also refused to discuss the foreign exchange market 
abroad, where the dollar temporarily sank Friday to a one-month 
low in the 109 yen range before rebounding. Currency dealers 
said the failure of the reform bills throws the stimulus package 
in doubt and increases chances that Washington will revert to 
high-yen pressure to cut Japan's trade surplus. 
  Hosokawa remains committed to the February 11 meeting in 
Washington with Clinton, both sides said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- The Japanese Government on 
Monday [24 January] described as "untimely" remarks by U.S. 
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen over the weekend that 
Washington may "reexamine" the bilateral trade framework talks 
if no accord is reached before a Japan-U.S. summit on February 
11. Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata told a press conference that 
Bentsen made the remarks "too early" since vice 
ministerial-level talks are now under way in Washington. 
  At a separate news conference, Vice Foreign Minister 
Kunihiko 
Saito also called Bentsen's remarks "untimely" and "not 
constructive" because both sides are engaging in serious 
discussions to achieve agreements. Saito said it was not timely 
because Japan and the U.S. have been strengthening their 
efforts to produce such accords. 
  On Sunday, Bentsen said the United States "will not settle 
for any cosmetic agreement" on trade and that "if we do not have 
credible agreements by the time of the summit, we would have to 
reexamine the basis of the framework." Bentsen said his remarks 
are not meant as a threat but were "just the logical 
consequence," reflecting "the realities of the situation."

  [Text] Washington, Jan. 21 KYODO -- Japan and the United 
States wrapped up three days of working-level trade talks Friday 
[21 January] to address issues of foreign direct investment in 
both countries, Japanese officials said. The "working group" 
session on investment is part of the wide-ranging framework 
trade talks the two countries have been holding to increase 
access and sales of foreign goods and services in Japan. 
  Officials from the two countries were also meeting 
separately 
in Washington on the access and sales of auto parts in Japan. 
  Japanese officials characterized the latest session on 
investment issues as preliminary, noting that the investment 
sector is not on the "priority list" that must be completed by 
the February 11 summit between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
and President Bill Clinton. 
  Discussions were limited primarily to a presentation of 
matters of concern both to the U.S. and Japan on investment 
issues. Among the issues the U.S. raised were excessive 
government regulation on foreign direct investment and problems 
foreign investors face in the acquisition of Japanese 
corporations. 
  Washington has charged that Japan deliberately blocks the 
entry of foreign capital into Japan, which U.S. officials said 
has caused a "substantial loss of potential exports" from 
foreign firms to their Japanese subsidiaries. 
  According to U.S. figures, Japan hosted about 12 billion 
dollars in foreign direct investment in 1991, representing only 
0.7 percent of the world's stock of inward direct investment. 
  By contrast, the U.S. hosted 414 billion dollars, or 22 
percent, of the stock of inward direct investment. The 
corresponding figure for the European Union -- as the former 
European Community is now known -- was 714 billion dollars, or 
38 percent, U.S. officials said.

  [Text] Washington, Jan. 22 KYODO -- The issue of 
"objective criteria" is likely to dominate talks between senior 
Japanese and U.S. trade negotiators on foreign access to Japan's 
government procurement market, a Japanese official said Saturday 
[22 January]. 
  The so-called framework trade negotiations between Japan and 
the United States move up to the deputy minister level Sunday as 
working-level officials were struggling to complete a "progress 
report," their positions deadlocked over pivotal provisions of 
the framework accord. 
  "I guess objective criteria will be main theme at the 
deputies' meeting" on government procurement, a Japanese 
official involved in the trade talks told reporters after 
completing yet another working-group session with U.S. officials 
Saturday. 
  A huge Japanese Government team comprising 40 to 50 
officials 
is in Washington for a wide range of sector-by-sector trade 
talks set for the coming week. 
  Two sets of deputy minister meetings are set for Sunday, one 
on the implementation of existing trade agreements concluded 
between the two countries and the other on foreign access to the 
government procurement market in Japan. 
  The U.S. insists on setting "quantitative criteria" to 
measure the progress of foreign access and sales in the Japanese 
Government procurement market. Japan has balked at the U.S. 
demand, arguing that any numerical yardstick would inevitably be 
regarded by the U.S. as a formal commitment by Japan to set 
aside a certain market share for foreign firms. 
  Japanese officials appear not to be hopeful of any 
breakthrough on the "objective criteria" issue at the deputy 
ministers' meetings. "The prognosis looks dicey," one official 
said. 
  The stalemate on objective criteria is just one of many gaps 
between the two sides on the government procurement issue. 
  Japanese officials said there is no agreement on the scope 
of 
public entities that must be covered under new government 
procurement codes nor on the amount of government procurement 
that must be open to foreign participation. 
  In addition to government procurement issues, other areas of 
framework trade talks scheduled for the coming week in 
Washington include sales of foreign-made automobiles and auto 
parts in Japan, regulatory reform and issues of competitiveness 
between the two countries. 
  The entire set of negotiations is supposed to be concluded 
prior to the summit meeting between Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton on February 11 in Washington.

<F P=106> [By Antonio Kamiya] </F>
  [Text] Washington, Jan. 23 KYODO -- Officials in charge 
of drafting a so-called "framework" trade accord in time for the 
upcoming U.S.-Japan summit met for the first time Sunday [23 
January] and left the biggest bone of contention -- how to 
measure "tangible progress" on foreign access to Japanese 
markets -- virtually untouched. 
  Japanese officials who attended the day's two separate 
sessions later told reporters that they had decided to leave the 
contentious issue of objective criteria for negotiations at a 
plenary subcabinet session beginning Monday. 
  Senior officials from Japan's foreign and trade ministries 
met behind closed doors for five and half hours Sunday with a 
U.S. counterpart -- deputy U.S. Trade Representative Charlene 
Barshevsky -- to address two areas in the wide-ranging framework 
trade talks. One area concerns ways to increase foreign access 
and sales in Japan's government procurements, and the other 
seeks to address U.S. concern on the implementation of existing 
bilateral trade agreements. 
  Japanese officials said talks on how to monitor the 
implementation of existing trade accords on such market sectors 
as semiconductor, paper and glass drew little dissent from both 
sides. 
  After a two-hour meeting that was described as "friendly and 
lively" between Japan's Vice Minister for International Trade 
and Industry Sozaburo Okamatsu and Barshevsky, the two sides 
struck an agreement on how to monitor past trade accords, 
Japanese officials said. 
  The two sides agreed on three principles -- "objective 
description of the situation," stating "different positions in a 
balanced manner," and mutual efforts "to resolving any factual 
misunderstanding" -- as the basis for keeping track of existing 
trade pacts, the officials said. 
  Japanese officials, however, conceded that there was little 
attempt in a separate set of talks Sunday between Deputy Foreign 
Minister Koichiro Matsuura and Barshevsky to bridge the gap on 
ways to set up "objective criteria" for measuring foreign access 
to Japan's government procurement market. 
  "We will talk about it at the plenary session tomorrow," a 
Japanese official said, noting that the issue of objective 
criteria is also linked to separate negotiations on foreign 
access to Japan's automobile and insurance markets. 
  Senior U.S. officials have said the framework trade talks 
must produce "tangible progress" in foreign access to Japanese 
markets, and have suggested using import levels in other 
industrial countries as yardsticks for gauging the openness of 
the Japanese markets. 
  Tokyo has balked at the idea, arguing that market shares, or 
any measurements that "smack" of market-share arrangements, run 
counter to free trade. 
  Japanese officials Sunday sought to draw the line on what 
type of "objective criteria" is acceptable to Tokyo, saying that 
the Japanese Government would not mind using past economic data 
-- such as the value of imports in specific market sectors -- as 
indicators of progress in foreign access to Japanese markets. 
  "Anything that suggests a future target is out of the 
question," said a senior Japanese official, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
  The Japanese and U.S. principals involved in negotiations on 
the government procurement, auto, and insurance market sectors 
are supposed to complete a progress report on their talks by the 
time Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton 
meet in Washington on February 11. 
  U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen has warned Tokyo that 
the U.S. Government would rather junk the framework talks rather 
than accept "any cosmetic agreement." 
  "If we do not have credible agreements by the time of the 
(February 11) summit, we would have to reexamine the basis of 
the framework," Bentsen told reporters on Sunday after a short 
visit to Tokyo.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa will hold a summit meeting in Washington with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton on February 11 as scheduled, the chief 
government spokesman said Monday [24 January]. 
  Doubts had been raised about the meeting amid political 
uncertainty in Japan following Friday's rejection of crucial 
political reform bills by the House of Councillors, But Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told reporters at a regular 
news conference, "the schedule remains unchanged." 
  The summit will center on bilateral framework trade talks 
aimed at expanding access for imports to the Japanese market. 
  U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said in Tokyo on 
Sunday 
that the United States may "reexamine" the stalled trade talks 
if no agreement is reached before next month's summit. Hosokawa 
and Clinton agreed on the February summit when they met in the 
U.S. city of Seattle during the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation session there in November.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- Farm Minister Eijiro Hata 
said Monday [24 January] that Japan's decision to partially open 
its rice market to imports does not necessarily mean it has 
agreed to begin adopting a tariffication scheme for rice from 
the seventh year under the GATT accord. 
  There is room for negotiations on whether or not Japan must 
take that step, Hata said. The agriculture, forestry and 
fisheries minister was addressing the Japan National Press Club. 
  The draft farm trade accord proposed by the General 
Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) allows Tokyo to resume discussion on 
the issue before it enters the seventh year, he said. 
  In December, Tokyo accepted without modification the GATT 
accord, which calls for Japan to open 4 percent to 8 percent of 
its domestic rice market as the minimum access for imports in 
exchange for a six-year moratorium for replacing all import 
restrictions with tariffs. The proposal requires Japan to make 
additional concessions in order for the special treatment to be 
extended beyond the sixth year. 
  Specific commitments or conditions for extending the 
moratorium beyond the sixth year are also negotiable later, Hata 
said. 
  Hata said he will not resign as farm minister over Japan's 
accepting the opening of its rice market. He said he will 
devote himself for the time being to laying the groundwork for 
his successor to effectively handle possible problems after the 
rice market opening. 
  "That's the way I will take the responsibility," he said. 
  Hata forecast about one-third of the nation's three million 
rice farmers will leave farming in 10 years, affected by the 
opening of the rice market. 
  Hata proposed using imported rice under the minimum access 
clause mainly for four areas -- stockpiling for emergency rice 
for shortages, using it in processed foods such as rice 
crackers, experiments for development of new rice products, and 
supplying it to foreign countries as part of economic 
assistance. He said it has yet to be decided whether or not 
imported rice will be used as staple food. 
  Ha said imported rice, if consumed as staple food, would 
"hopefully" be blended with Japanese rice. 
  The amount of domestically produced rice to be provided for 
four months from March, for example, is only 30 percent of total 
supply capacity due to the poor harvest last year, Hata said, 
adding that supplies of domestic rice would run short quickly 
unless it was blended with foreign rice.

  [Text] Kushiro, Hokkaido, Jan. 24 KYODO -- The Hokkaido 
prefectural government initiated an investigation Monday [24 
January] into charges by the Russian Foreign Ministry that tens 
of Japanese fishing vessels violated Russian territorial waters 
Friday and Saturday. Russia alleges the Japanese fishing boats 
entered Russia's territorial waters near Kunashiri Island, one 
of four Russian-held islands claimed by Japan. 
  Prefectural government officials questioned the heads of 
eight fishery cooperatives, while the Maritime Safety Agency 
[MSA] requested a detailed explanation of what happened over the 
weekend. 
  MSA officials said the agency received a notification last 
Friday that Russia was strengthening its policies against border 
transgressions and added two to three patrol boats to the waters 
surrounding the disputed islands. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry also said that three Japanese 
patrol boats were in the vicinity at the time of the alleged 
transgressions but did nothing to halt the intrusions into 
Russian territory. The MSA on Monday denied the charge as 
"impossible." 
  ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY reported over the weekend that more 
than 50 Japanese vessels violated territorial waters Friday and 
some 30 others Saturday. 
  Japan has long called for the return of four 
Russian-occupied 
islands -- Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and the Habomai group -- 
which the former Soviet Union seized at the end of World War II.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- Japan's policy on aid to 
Russia remains unchanged despite the recent political 
instability there, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said Monday [24 
January]. At a press conference, Hata brushed aside some 
reports suggesting that Japan's policy on aid to Russia has 
changed because of recent political developments in Moscow, such 
as the resignations of reformers First Deputy Premier Yegor 
Gaydar and Finance Minister Boris Fedorov. 
  Japan's position to support, in cooperation with the Group 
of 
Seven (G-7) nations, Russia's efforts for democratization, a 
shift toward a market-oriented economy and a transition to a 
diplomacy based on law and justice, remains unchanged, Hata 
said. Japan is watching closely Russia's moves to form a 
cabinet and other developments concerning its domestic politics, 
but it has not yet changed its policy on aid to Russia, he said. 
  He said Tokyo will continue to extend the aid by grasping 
the 
progress of reforms in Russia and by understanding the needs of 
the Russian people. 
  Hata also said Russia's development and stabilization are 
important because the country has influence within the 
international community and great resources and technology.

  [Text] Washington, Jan. 21 KYODO -- The defeat of Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's political reform package at the 
hands of the House of Councillors Friday [21 January] sent shock 
waves among U.S. officials involved in crucial trade talks with 
Japan. "We're looking at the situation in Japan closely," U.S. 
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said. "Obviously it's a 
fluid situation in which no one is quite sure what the outcome 
will be." 
  Bowman Cutter, deputy presidential assistant for economic 
policy and the White House point man coordinating the 
"framework" trade negotiations was more brunt. 
  The upper house's rejection of Hosokawa's initiative to 
overhaul the Japanese electoral system is a "significant 
setback" for the Japanese Government, cutter said in an 
interview on CNBC cable television. 
  Hosokawa's political troubles came as senior officials from 
the two countries were gearing up for a final round of trade 
talks ahead of a summit meeting in Washington with President 
Bill Clinton on February 11. 
  Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshevsky said 
the 
trade talks would proceed as scheduled. Like Kantor, she 
declined to comment on whether Hosokawa's political troubles 
would cloud prospects of the summit meeting. 
  Some U.S. political analysts were less circumspect. 
  "The political situation in Japan has become very dicey," 
said Douglas Paal, former special assistant for Asian affairs on 
the National Security Council. Paal told a private forum on 
U.S.-Japan trade relations that he believes the political 
upheavals in Tokyo will have "a big impact" on the 
Hosokawa-Clinton summit. 
  In his television interview, Cutter said Clinton remains 
"extremely supportive" of Hosokawa's reform efforts. 
  Senior U.S. Administration officials have said Washington 
had 
hoped Hosokawa would shift his focus to reviving the stalled 
Japanese economy once the political reform issue was out of the 
way. Cutter said Friday that Clinton still expects the Japanese 
Government to introduce a stimulus package, noting that the 
issues of political reform and economic stimulus are "quite 
distinct." 
  U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen is due in Tokyo on 
Sunday for talks with Hosokawa and Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii. 
  Tokyo and Washington are currently engaged in wide-ranging 
trade talks through which Washington hopes to secure a Japanese 
commitment to adopt specific measures to reduce its vast trade 
surplus and open up specific market sectors of particular 
interest to U.S. businesses. 
  The Clinton administration has repeatedly said the size of 
Japan's trade surplus is "politically untenable." Clinton 
himself reinforced his determination to cut the trade gap with 
Japan, saying on a television talk show Thursday that Japan is 
one of the "biggest problems" for U.S. trade.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 22 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, undaunted by Friday's [21 January] rejection of his 
political reform legislation package by the House of 
Councillors, still aims to attain the goal within a week, his 
associates said Saturday. Hosokawa, in meetings with his 
supporters who called at his official residence Saturday, 
expressed his resolve to accomplish reforms. 
  Hosokawa, who came to power last August, took a stinging 
blow 
Friday when the upper house voted against a package of four 
political reform bills with a vote of 118 for and 130 against. 
  Hosokawa stated last year he will take responsibility if he 
fails to bring about political reforms by the end of that year. 
But he extended the deadline to the end of the current session 
of the Diet due to expire January 29. 
  He still has one full week until the end of the current Diet 
session to work out a compromise through negotiations with the 
opposition camp and to enact political reform bills. 
  Koki Ishii, a member of the Japan New Party which the prime 
minister leads, said Hosokawa has no plan to dissolve the House 
of Representatives and call for a snap general election. 
  Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said 
in a lecture in Fukuoka on the southern main island of Kyushu on 
Saturday there still is a chance to get political reforms 
approved by the Diet. "What is important now is to realize 
reforms. If both ruling and opposition sides are willing to do 
so, reform bills will be attained," he said. 
  To revive the political reform program, amendments need to 
be 
made by a joint council of 10 members each from both houses for 
approval by plenary sessions of both houses before the current 
Diet session ends. 
  Hata said Hosokawa will continue to pursue his goal instead 
of resigning his post because his cabinet still enjoys a 
popularity rating of over 50 percent. 
  Home Affairs Minister Kanju Sato, speaking in Tsu, Mie 
Prefecture, said the ruling coalition is ready to compromise 
with the opposition Liberal Democratic Party to carry out 
political reforms. 
  Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the LDP's Policy Affairs 
Research Council, blamed Hosokawa's performance for Friday's 
upper house decision. 
  He said the dissolution of the lower house is unrealistic in 
view of pressing diplomatic and domestic affairs, such as a 
summit between Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton and 
formulation of the fiscal 1994 budget. 
  Shin Sakurai, a deputy secretary general of the LDP, said he 
will go all out to kill the reform bills although he favors the 
enactment of an anticorruption law. 
  Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP), addressing an emergency meeting of the party's central 
executive committee, expressed deep regret at the upper house 
action and the party as the largest group in the ruling 
coalition has to take the blame for it. 
  While declining to make clear whether he will step down as 
party leader to take responsibility for the failure, he said he 
will continue efforts to bring about political reforms. 
  In a related development, Michio Watanabe, a former foreign 
minister and leader of one of the LDP's five major factions, 
appeared on a television program and called for a two-step 
reform with priority placed on prevention of corruption, 
followed by a change in the election system. 
  Political sources said Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and 
Komeito, both in the ruling coalition, consider it unavoidable 
to make bold concessions to the LDP to get the political reform 
package through the Diet. Such a move, however, will face 
strong resistance from the SDP, which is widely split over the 
reform package, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 22 KYODO -- Leaders of the Social 
Democratic Party (SDP), the biggest group among seven parties in 
the ruling coalition, agreed Saturday [22 January] to oppose 
reviving reform bills sponsored by the Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP) in an effort to reach a compromise, party officials said. 
The officials said top party executives and the party's central 
executive committee met and agreed that the SDP will continue to 
support a package of four government-proposed bills, which fell 
through in the House of Councillors on Friday. 
  The LDP bills allow corporations to give donations to 
individual politicians, while the government bills ban such 
donations and allow only corporate donations to political 
parties. 
  On Friday, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa hinted 
at accepting the LDP package as a compromise to enact political 
reform before the current extraordinary session of the Diet 
expires January 29. But the SDP strongly opposes easing 
proposed controls on political funding. 
  The SDP also decided to severely punish the 17 SDP 
legislators who voted against the package in defiance of the 
party leadership, and did not exclude the possibility that the 
legislators may be expelled from the party. It also recommended 
that Yutaka Shitoma, one of the rebels and the head of the 
party's election committee, give up his seat on the central 
executive committee, the officials said. 
  The House of Councillors dismissed the government package 
with 130 to 118 votes mainly due to the unexpectedly high number 
of SDP dissidents which substantially outnumbered the five LDP 
members who crossed party lines to vote for the bills. SDP 
Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, speaking at the central executive 
committee session, acknowledged the SDP's responsibility for the 
defeat of the reform bills and said, "We firmly support the 
coalition government, and want to live up to our 
responsibilities by tackling the remaining problems." 
  Many political sources have expected the party leadership to 
resign sooner or later because of failure to unite its members 
behind the government bills.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from "NHK News 7" program] </F>
  [Text] In a meeting of the party Central Executives 
Council today, the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], many 
members of which revolted and joined the opposition parties in 
defeating the government-proposed political reform bills in the 
upper house on 21 January, reaffirmed the policy of pushing to 
have the bills approved by the Diet in the current session, and 
decided to mete out strict disciplinary actions against the 
members who voted against the bills. 
  SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama in the meeting said the 
responsibility of the SDPJ as a member of the coalition parties 
is great. He asked for cooperation of the party members, saying 
the party must be resolved to answer the expectations of the 
people on pending political issues. 
  Chairman Murayama said he will not think about resigning but 
will continue to lead the party. He said the party leadership 
will continue efforts to have the bills approved in the current 
Diet session. In talks with coalition member parties and in 
discussions in the joint conference of two houses of the Diet, 
he said, his party will continue to insist that the prevention 
of political corruption should be the main theme in the 
political reform. 
  The party Central Executives Council in the meeting today 
decided the upper house members who voted against the political 
reform bills should be strictly disciplined. 
  The leaders of the SDPJ group in the upper house also met 
today, and decided to urge four of the rebel members, who belong 
to the SDPJ's upper house floor group but are not formally 
affiliated with the SDPJ, to leave the group. Regarding the 
rebels who are formal members of the party, the leaders agreed 
to request the party Central Executives Council to consider 
dismissing them from the party. The council will make a 
decision on whether to remove them from the party's upper house 
pact by 27 January. 
  Meanwhile, in the SDPJ Kanagawa Prefecture chapter, 
officials 
of the chapter decided to resign en masse, taking responsibility 
for a SDPJ upper house member from the chapter voting against 
the bills. Apparently, the impact from differences over ways of 
dealing with the reform bills is sending ripples to local 
chapters as well. 
  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata gave a speech at Fukuoka City 
today. Speaking about how he thinks the political reform bills 
should be handled, he said he cannot accept any proposal to 
limit the reform to that aimed only at preventing corruption. 
Noting some people are talking about enacting only the bill 
relating to political corruption, he said if these people are 
serious about the political reform, they would not be saying 
such a thing. 
  In the speech, Hata claimed the cause of the political 
corruption problem lies in the current election system enabling 
political parties to field many candidates in each of the 
electoral districts, thus forcing the parties to use so much 
money in campaigns. As long as that issue remains unresolved, 
the political scenes will never change, he insisted. He thus 
made it clear that he will not accept the idea of narrowing the 
reform efforts to only those concerning corruption as now being 
talked about by the Liberal Democratic Party and some of the 
SDPJ members. 
  Regarding the possibility of Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosoakwa's assuming political responsibility in case the 
political bills fail to be passed by the Diet in the current 
session, Foreign Minister Hata noted that public opinion polls 
showed more than 50 percent of the people support his cabinet. 
If Hosokawa decides to do that, Hata said, it will only incur 
the anger of the people. Each and every member of the Diet 
should be held responsible for this situation, he insisted. 
  Within the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], in the mean time, 
there are now growing voices that the bill on prevention of 
corruption should be acted on first. But there are also some 
who think a compromise plan should be worked out in the joint 
conference of the two houses. 
  Ryutaro Hashitomo, chairman of the LDP Policy Research 
Council, spoke in Nayoro City, Hokkaido, about the political 
reform bills, and said Prime Minister Hosokawa and all the 
cabinet members should think where the problem lies. He said he 
wants them to feel responsible about the abusive way they run 
the Diet and about their dialogue intended as only a show 
performance. Noting that it is clear that the political reform 
bills cannot be passed as they are now, Hashimoto urged the 
government to change its way of thinking. 
  Hashimoto indicated he wants to be cautious in responding to 
proposed talks with the coalition to discuss a new compromise. 
  Meanwhile, Keizo Obuchi, former general secretary of the 
LDP, 
who heads the Obuchi faction, delivered a speech in Gunma 
Prefecture. According to him, a general agreement by members of 
both houses in the Diet must be a precondition to holding the 
talks to discuss a compromise plan. He said the party should be 
cautious about agreeing to a compromise plan. 
  Another LDP leader -- former Foreign Minister Michio 
Watanabe 
-- spoke in a commercial television program this afternoon, and 
said the polical reforms should start from measures on 
preventing corruption and controlling political funds. He 
insisted that enough time must be given to discussions on the 
political reform. 
  In another scene, the group of the LDP members supporting 
the 
political reform -- the Dietmen's Union for Promotion of 
Political Reform -- decided to launch a signature collection 
campaign within the party in a call to urge the party leadership 
to positively participate in the joint conference of the two 
houses to come up with a new compromise plan.

  [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in 
Japanese at 2230 GMT on 22 January, in its regularly-scheduled 
"News 2001" program, carries a 60-minute live relay of a 
roundtable debate participated in by Yoshiro Mori, general 
secretary of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP); Koken Nosaka, 
chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Japan's (SDPJ) Diet 
Affairs Committee; and Kozo Watanabe, general secretary of 
Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party). 
  Former SDPJ Secretary General Hirotaka Akamatsu, and 
Masatoshi Ito, one of the SDPJ upper house members who voted 
against the government-proposed political reform bills on 21 
January, join in the debate via remote hookup in the latter part 
of the program which is moderated by newscasters Yuji Kuroiwa 
and Kaori Matsuyama. 
  After a lengthy introduction of the guests, moderator 
Kuroiwa 
at 2238 GMT begins the discussion by noting the reform bills 
were rejected unexpectedly by the upper house, and asks Mori of 
the LDP how he feels about it. Mori, though speaking on behalf 
of the opposition camp, says it was "very regrettable" and adds: 
"While the Diet is a forum for the representatives of the 
people, it was unable to understand the bills." The LDP general 
secretary says, "Another point to note -- aside from the 
question of the substance of the bills -- is that this body -- 
the House of Councillors -- is independent, and is separate from 
the House of Representatives. This fact has been more or less 
ignored by many, particularly by those of the ruling parties, 
and the members of the House of Councillors have been angered by 
it." 
  Asked how he feels about the voting results, the SDPJ's 
Nosaka also says it was "very regrettable" that the bills were 
rejected. Nosaka says: "The party must, once again, do all it 
can do to have the bills passed during the current session of 
the Diet." 
  After some introductory remarks by the newscasters and a 
review of the political scene by guest political commentators, 
full-fledged debate starts at 2338 GMT. Moderator Kuroiwa asks 
Mori to comment on reports that the LDP wants the bill dealing 
with political corruption to be taken up first, ahead of other 
bills. Mori explains the history of why the efforts for 
political reform started, recalling, "The people became 
disappointed with close ties between politics and money, as well 
as by scandals involving politicians, and they started to 
distance themselves from politics. Political reform started 
about six years ago from the desire to do something about this 
situation." 
  Asked whether Mori believes the bill on political corruption 
should be acted on ahead of other bills during the one-week 
remaining of the current Diet session, he says there are some 
who think that way, but he declines to give his own view. 
  Kuroiwa asks Mori if the LDP would agree to pass the bills 
if 
the coalition accepts amendments to the bills proposed by the 
LDP before the bills are put to the vote. Mori responds: "The 
bills were in fact scrapped, and rejected. Now that this has 
happened, the various organizations within the party have to 
agree on a policy to deal with the matter. I think that will be 
done on Monday (24 January) or Tuesday." 
  At 2256 GMT, Shinseito's Watanabe is asked to give his view. 
Watanabe notes that the LDP leadership made a proposal to his 
party on changes in the government bills last week. Watanabe 
says his party is willing to make daring concessions in 
accepting the terms of the LDP in the forthcoming negotiations. 
  The moderator recalls that the terms demanded by the LDP 
include one on accepting political fund contributions by 
business organizations, and asks Nosaka of the SDPJ if his party 
can accept such a condition. Nosaka says his party cannot 
accept everything in the LDP terms, but adds his party is 
willing to negotiate as much as possible and make a final 
decision after the negotiations are completed. 
  At 2304 GMT, the SDPJ's Ito, one of the rebels who voted 
against the political reform bills in the upper house session, 
is asked to comment via the remote hookup. Ito insists that 
what the people of the nation really want in political reform is 
to prevent political corruption and that, as such, what is 
needed is a bill dealing with corruption. He says the election 
system has nothing to do with political corruption. 
  At 2305 GMT, moderator Matsuyama asks Akamatsu if the 
SDPJ upper house members who voted against the bills will be 
expelled from the party. Akamatsu says: "I asked Chairman 
Murayama and Secretary-General Kubo to deal strictly with or 
expel from the party the rebels who ignored the party resolution 
and voted against the bills at a critical time for the SDPJ. 
Mr. Murayama and Mr. Kubota, needless to say, said they would 
deal strictly with the rebels because the situation this time 
was completely different from the time when some SDPJ lower 
house members voted against the bills." 
  Asked what he thinks of Akamatsu's comment, Ito says the 
SDPJ 
mainstream was to pass the bill on prevention of political 
corruption first. Akamatsu immediately refutes this, saying: 
"The party convention, held on 11 and 12 January, unanimously 
agreed to resolutely promote political reform." He adds that 
"those who cannot abide by the party resolution have no right to 
remain in the party." Nosaka agrees with Akamatsu and says: 
"We will have a meeting with local representatives at 1500 
(0600 GMT) on 26 January to hear what they have to say. We will 
also listen to the opinions of the party's upper house 
executives. After that, we will deal strictly with the rebels." 
  At 2309 GMT, Kobayashi points out that public disclosure of 
their internal problems will be a big blow to the SDPJ, and that 
it may be better to split the party into two because the 
so-called rebels have different beliefs from other SDPJ members. 
Nosaka responds to Kobayashi, saying that although there are 
many different opinions, the party has been very democratic in 
determining party resolutions or in finding "the greatest common 
denominator." 
  Going back to the issue of political reform, Kuroiwa asks 
Watanabe what the coalition parties are going to do about the 
bills during the remaining period of the current Diet session. 
Watanabe says: "Of course, we will call for a joint conference 
of the two houses. This is our constitutional right." He also 
explains the need to hold a top-level meeting between Prime 
Minister Hosokawa and LDP President Kono to settle the political 
reform issue. 
  Asked what he thinks of the proposal to hold such a meeting, 
Mori says: "As I briefly explained earlier, I think it is a 
good idea. However, the important thing is whether Mr. Hosokawa 
has discretionary power." Mori then criticizes Prime Minister 
Hosokawa for lack of leadership and failing to have the 
political reform bills approved. 
  As for the possibility of dissolving the lower house, and 
thereby forcing a general election, Watanabe and Mori agree that 
the time is not right because the government has many "important 
and imminent tasks," including the Japan-U.S. summit and budget 
compilation. 
  The live relay ends at 2330 GMT.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- Deputy Prime Minister and 
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata voiced optimism Monday [24 
January] that the government can secure Diet approval for 
political reform bills before the current session ends Saturday. 
"I think the political reform bills are sure to be passed by 
the Diet because there are still opportunities for 
negotiations," Hata told a meeting with business executives at a 
Tokyo hotel. 
  Hata, who is also head of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), 
said the package can still be approved either by a joint panel 
of both houses of the Diet or by a two-thirds majority at the 
House of Representatives. 
  The House of Councillors rejected the package of four bills 
Friday. Seventeen rebel members of the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP), the largest force in the ruling coalition, joined members 
of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party and Japanese 
Communist Party to vote down the package. 
  Hata said the enactment of the four reform bills, which 
would 
introduce a new election system and measures designed to curtail 
corruption, would produce "dynamism" in Japanese politics 
because it would activate stalled debates in the Diet. He 
brushed aside suggestions for corruption prevention measures to 
be enacted before overall political reform, saying the root of 
political corruption lies in the current multiseat constituency 
system. 
  Touching on the sluggish economy, Hata predicted that the 
future of Japan's economy is not so gloomy, although it is 
unlikely to recover immediately. He told the audience of 
executives and managers from across Japan that compiling of the 
state budget and carrying out deregulations are essential for 
the economy, saying it would boost demand in Japan, open markets 
for other countries and improve public life. 
  The foreign minister expressed willingness for Japan to 
become a permanent member of the United Nations Security 
Council, saying Japan has various techniques and know-how to 
offer to the world besides money and that its role is to extend 
them to the world. Hata said Japan should take initiatives on 
the international scene and put forward its own proposals.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- The Social Democratic 
Party (SDP) [of Japan, SDPJ], the largest among seven parties in 
the ruling coalition, said Monday [24 January] it is ready to 
accept a call from the main opposition party to hold summit 
talks between their heads over the political reform process. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told a meeting with labor 
leaders Monday that he received an informal call for a summit 
between him and Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP). In the meeting, Murayama indicated that the SDP 
alone cannot strike a compromise over the matter noting the 
party is one of seven partners in the coalition, SDP officials 
said. 
  LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori earlier proposed holding 
talks between Kono and Murayama. 
  The MAINICHI SHIMBUN reported Monday that Kono and Murayama 
should have summit talks and agree to consider legislating an 
antigraft law separate from election reform bills. The national 
daily said if the country's two largest parties agree on placing 
priority on anticorruption measures, it will have a significant 
impact in resolving the impasse over political reform. 
  Last week, the House of Councillors voted down a package of 
four government-sponsored political reform bills which had 
passed the House of Representatives in November. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and his ruling coalition 
are 
seeking to establish a joint panel of the two houses in a 
last-ditch effort to achieve political reform by Saturday, when 
the current session of the Diet ends. The political reform 
package is designed to introduce a combination of single-seat 
and proportional representation seats for lower house general 
elections, replacing the current multiseat district system, as 
well as stepping up controls on political fund-raising 
activities.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- Six cabinet ministers 
shared the view Monday [24 January] that political reform is a 
key vehicle to jacking up the economy, a cabinet spokesman said 
Monday. "They agree that a major premise for making decisions 
on important economy-related policies hinges on achieving 
political reform," Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobuo Ishihara 
told a news conference. 
  "They confirmed that seeing through the political reform 
package is one of the best economy-spurring measures," he said. 
  The six cabinet ministers made their views known at a 
meeting 
held at Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's official residence. 
They are all government members of an economic panel that 
advises the seven parties in the ruling coalition. 
  The six are Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, 
International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai, 
Economic Planning Agency Director General Manae Kubota and Home 
Affairs Minister Kanju Sato. 
  During the meeting, the ministers agreed that the next 15 
months are vital to getting the economy back on its feet in 1994 
and ensuring stable growth in 1995 and beyond, Ishihara said. 
The six did not discuss when additional pump-priming measures 
will be worked out and the national budget for fiscal 1994, 
starting April 1, will be formulated, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- The Diet will set up a 
joint council of its two houses Tuesday in a last-ditch effort 
to enact a political reform package that was killed last week by 
the House of Councillors, political sources said Monday [24 
January]. Ruling coalition and opposition parties are expected 
to agree on the setting up the 20-member joint council at a 
meeting Monday night of the House of Representatives steering 
committee, they said. 
  The House of Representatives will approve the establishment 
of the panel at a plenary session Tuesday. The council will be 
formed by 10 members each from both houses. 
  The House of Representatives, which approved the bills in 
November, will select its 10 members from among those who voted 
for them. The House of Councillors will send 10 members from 
among those who voted against the bills. 
  If two-thirds of the joint panel members agree on a 
compromise plan, the four bills can be enacted into law once 
they are endorsed by a majority of votes at plenary sessions of 
both houses of the Diet. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who has said he would take 
political responsibility if he fails to get the package passed, 
will put the bills to a floor vote again at a lower house 
plenary session if the joint council ends in failure, coalition 
officials said. 
  Hosokawa explained his strategy during a meeting Monday of 
representatives from parties in his ruling coalition. The prime 
minister told the session that he is ready to meet Yohei Kono, 
president of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], if 
Kono makes such a call. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a morning 
news conference that both the ruling and opposition camps need 
to hold frank talks and work out a compromise. 
  LDP Diet Affairs Committee Chairman Sadatoshi Ozato told 
reporters the coalition parties should unify their position and 
promise not to take a vote at the lower house plenary session 
even if talks at the joint panel fail. Under constitutional 
rules, bills which were approved by the lower house but 
rejected by the upper chamber can be revived for legislation if 
the lower house passes it again by a two-thirds majority. 
  The upper house voted down the package of four 
government-sponsored reform bills which among other things call 
for the introduction of a combination of single-seat and 
proportional representation districts for lower house general 
elections in place of multiseat constituencies. The reform 
bills also aim to tighten controls on political fund-raising to 
stem graft. 
  Seventeen legislators of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), 
the largest coalition bloc, sided with LDP members to reject the 
bills. 
  At a meeting Monday, leaders of seven parties in the ruling 
coalition renewed their resolve to pursue enactment of political 
reform by the end of the current Diet session, the officials 
said. 
  The coalition is determined to enact the bills as a package 
that encompasses antigraft measures, the officials said. The 
political reform bills will only be effective to wipe out 
corruption if they are enacted as a package, the officials said. 
  The 90-day schedule of the present extraordinary Diet 
session 
was extended for 45 days beyond the initial deadline on December 
15 to achieve Hosokawa's pledge to act on political reform bills 
during the current parliamentary session. The Diet session ends 
Saturday. 
  Since taking office in August after ousting the LDP from its 
38-year grip on power, Hosokawa has staked his political fate on 
enacting political reform. 
  In the wake of Japan's political turbulence, Tokyo stock 
prices plunged sharply with the 225-issue Nikkei stock average 
plummeting 954.19 points to finish at 18,353.24.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa will seek approval of a package of political reform 
bills at a House of Representatives plenary session if 
negotiations at a joint committee of both houses fail, officials 
said Monday [24 January]. Hosokawa made this clear at a meeting 
of representatives from parties in the ruling coalition, the 
officials said. 
  The package, which was rejected by a margin of 12 votes by 
the House of Councillors on Friday, can be enacted if it is 
passed again by a two-thirds majority in the lower house. The 
bills also could be enacted if a joint committee of 10 members 
each from both houses works out a compromise and wins approval 
by a majority vote from the two houses.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- The main opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) decided Monday [24 January] to 
agree to the setting up of a joint committee of both houses of 
the Diet to discuss modifications to a package of political 
reform bills. The government was defeated over the package last 
Friday, when it was rejected by the House of Councillors. 
  The LDP's decision to allow the matter to go before a Diet 
panel was reached by party President Yohei Kono and Secretary 
General Yoshiro Mori, the officials said. 
  The crucial package, on which Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa has staked his job, could still be enacted if the panel 
of 10 members from each of the two houses worked out a 
compromise that then won approval by a majority vote in both 
houses. The package rejected Friday had already been approved 
by the more powerful House of Representatives.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- With only six days 
remaining in the current Diet session, the governing coalition 
started a last-ditch effort Monday [24 January] to revive the 
government-proposed political reform bills that were rejected by 
the House of Councillors on Friday. 
  Top leaders of the government and the seven-party coalition 
during a meeting are expected to confirm their policy that the 
package be enacted during the current Diet session, which ends 
Saturday, by gaining a compromise with the main opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in a joint committee of both 
houses. 
  Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito and chief 
negotiator from the coalition, will meet his LDP counterpart 
Yoshiro Mori on Monday afternoon to seek consent from the LDP. 
Senior officials of the House of Representatives steering 
committee on Monday will also discuss the issue of forming the 
joint committee. 
  The coalition hopes to decide on setting up the joint 
committee at a Diet plenary session Tuesday. 
  The future of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is in doubt 
after the upper house rejected the reform bills he has pledged 
to enact before the current Diet session ends. 
  Tokyo stock prices plunged in the morning session amid 
Japan's political turbulence with the 225-issue Nikkei stock 
average tumbling 727.07 points to 18,580.36 at 10 A.M. 
  Hosokawa, who took office last August as the first prime 
minister from outside the LDP in 38 years, has vowed that he 
will take "political responsibility" if he fails to achieve 
political reform, suggesting he will dissolve the lower house 
for a snap general election or make his cabinet resign en masse. 
  As the package, which was rejected by a margin of 12 votes 
at 
an upper house plenary session, has already passed the lower 
house, it can be enacted if it is passed again by the lower 
house by a two-thirds majority, or if a joint committee of 10 
members each from both houses works out a compromise that wins 
approval by a majority vote from the two houses. 
  A tug-of-war between proponents and opponents of political 
reform within the LDP has intensified. A proponent group of LDP 
parliamentarians led by former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu will 
urge LDP President Yohei Kono Monday afternoon to seek a 
compromise with the coalition through a joint committee of both 
houses, party officials said. 
  Another LDP group led by former Foreign Minister Taro 
Nakayama decided Monday morning to call for a council to seek 
enactment of the anticorruption measures separate from the 
package, party officials said. 
  The government package is designed to clean up Japan's 
scandal-tainted political system, completely overhauling the 
mechanism for electing the lower house and tightening curbs on 
political funds.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 22 Kyodo -- The ASAHI SHIMBUN urged the 
ruling coalition Saturday [22 January] not to snuggle up to the 
main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in talks to 
revise the government-proposed political reform bills that were 
voted down Friday at a plenary session of the House of 
Councillors. 
  "The bills are not completely dead. They could be 
resuscitated by again winning a two-thirds or more majority in 
the House of Representatives, or by gaining approval in the 
joint committee of both houses," an editorial of the ASAHI said. 
  The upper chamber rejected the package by 130 votes to 118, 
with 20 members of the Social Democratic Party, the largest 
force within the ruling coalition, voting against or refraining 
from attending the voting session. 
  "The prime minister said, `there is now more room to reach a 
compromise with the LDP.'...But we would feel compelled to tell 
the coalition to hold it right there if some members are simply 
planning to adopt all of the LDP's proposals just to get the 
bills passed, as some of them have begun to openly say." 
  "We have thought all along that the LDP's bills, which were 
rejected by the lower house, had too many problems as they had a 
larger margin of single-seat constituencies than the 
government's plan, as well as less strict controls on political 
contributions by corporations. We cannot agree to the coalition 
snuggling up to the LDP without principle," the ASAHI said. 
  "We hold steadfast in our assertion that political reform 
must move forward as soon as possible. But that depends on the 
contents of the reforms. Rather than adopting all of the LDP's 
ideas as they are, it would be better for the government to 
think seriously about starting afresh in devising ways to 
restrict political funds and prevent corruption, separately from 
reforms in the election system," the ASAHI said. 
  The MAINICHI SHIMBUN and the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN said Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa should not to retreat in the content 
of the reform bills in negotiating with the opposition camp. 
  "If (Hosokawa's remarks) mean he intends to ease 
restrictions 
on political contribution by corporations to individual 
politicians, we firmly oppose to that," the MAINICHI said. The 
MAINICHI also said it opposes dissolution of the Diet for a snap 
general election to break the deadlock. 
  The NIHON KEIZAI said that at least measures for 
anticorruption and tightening political funds controls should be 
realized during the current Diet session, which ends on January 
29, and that electoral system reforms, which are currently 
thought to be the pivotal part of the bills, can be discussed 
later. It criticized both the ruling and opposition parties for 
having altered the anticorruption drive into a means to change 
the electoral system. 
  The YOMIURI SHIMBUN said, "The ruling and opposition parties 
must be aware of their joint responsibility to enact political 
reform and should begin talks immediately to fashion a 
compromise." 
  The YOMIURI calls on Hosokawa and LDP President Yohei Kono 
to 
hold a meeting to reach a compromise.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 20 KYODO -- A former Diet member of 
Komeito was questioned in court Thursday [20 January] as the 
first of two politicians indicted in the 1989 Recruit 
stocks-for-favors scandal. 
  Katsuya Ikeda, 56, a former House of Representatives 
legislator of Komeito, which is now in the ruling coalition, was 
questioned by his defense council and prosecutors at the Tokyo 
District Court about his alleged involvement in the scandal. He 
denied all the charges against him. 
  In May 1989, prosecutors indicted Ikeda without arresting 
him, on charges of receiving 5,000 unlisted shares of Recruit 
Cosmos, a real estate company, and 7 million yen in cash from 
Hiromasa Ezoe, founder and then chairman of Recruit Co., a major 
publisher of job information magazines, in September 1986. The 
shares appreciated considerably after being listed. 
  Ikeda is accused of taking the shares and the money in 
return 
for acting on the firm's behalf in the Diet in 1984 and 1985, 
when a "gentlemen's agreement" that companies fix the date to 
recruit university graduates was on the verge of becoming a 
titular accord. 
  Ikeda said his Diet questioning was not done on behalf of 
the 
firm. 
  In response to his defense council's questioning on the 
issue, Ikeda said he already had an interest in problems of job 
placement for university students before he was asked by Recruit 
to bring up the issue in the Diet as asserted by prosecutors. 
  Ikeda said he began to have an interest in the job placement 
accord around 1977 just after becoming a member of the lower 
house and had a recognition the accord would be difficult to 
observe. 
  Along with Ikeda, then Chief Cabinet Secretary Takao 
Fujinami 
of the then ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), was indicted 
in the influence-peddling scandal. 
  Fujinami is being tried on charges of receiving Recruit 
Cosmos shares before their flotation as a bribe from Ezoe, 57, 
for similar favors to the firm. 
  The stocks-for-favors scandal involved secretaries or 
relatives of LDP heavyweights such as former Premiers Yasuhiro 
Nakasone, Noboru Takeshita, Kiichi Miyazawa and former Foreign 
Minister Michio Watanabe. 
  Takeshita, then prime minister, and Miyazawa, then finance 
minister, were forced to resign because of the scandal.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- The government will press 
ahead with plans for a fresh economic stimulus package while 
trying to revamp the scandal-plagued electoral system, Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said Monday [24 January]. 
  "I feel responsible for the delay in the announcement (of 
the 
pump-priming measures) from the original schedule of 
mid-January," the government's most senior spokesman told a news 
conference. "Since this is a matter of greatest concern to the 
public we want to work in parallel (with political reform 
deliberations)," he said. 
  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who heads an economic panel 
for the government and ruling coalition parties, plans to resume 
talks with members of his committee early this week, Takemura 
said. But Takemura could not say if the economic stimulus 
package will be put together this month, saying he does not have 
enough information on the timetable. 
  On Monday morning's plunge in Tokyo stock prices, Takemura 
commented, "the government will watch with great interest (the 
stock market movement) as a key index to gauge the state of the 
economy." 
  Share prices went into tailspin on Monday morning as the 
Nikkei stock average of 225 blue chips plunged 836.18 points to 
finish at 18,471.25.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- The government is expected 
to work out its new economic stimulus package in time before the 
Japan-U.S. summit in Washington on February 11, a top Finance 
Ministry official said Monday [24 January]. Vice Finance 
Minister Jiro Saito told a regular press meeting that it is the 
common view that the package would be in place before the 
summit, referring to early comments by Vice Trade Minister 
Hideaki Kumano calling for the launching by the summit. 
  Saito brushed aside the income tax cut issue, saying, "it 
will be decided by the economic problem forum" of the government 
and coalition parties. 
  Noting that the third extra budget for fiscal 1993 and the 
fiscal 1994 budget are to follow the package, Saito said he 
hopes the political turmoil would subside to allow "various 
measures as soon as possible." 
  Saito said the plunge in stock prices "stems from political 
uncertainties and other factors." But he rejected any effects 
from a possible delay in the economic package and budget. 
  "We have never mentioned a date to compile the budget," he 
said, adding the package was not slated for release on the day 
and the failure of the political reform bills to pass the upper 
house of the Diet came only last Friday. 
  Economic Planning Agency head Manae Kubota also said the 
implementation of economic stimulus measures by the government 
may be delayed until next month due to political uncertainty. 
  Kubota told a news conference that parties in the ruling 
coalition have already reached a broad agreement on the contents 
of the economic package, except income tax cuts. The income tax 
reduction, however, is an important pillar of the package and it 
should not be excluded from the program, she said. 
  She said political reforms must be implemented at all costs 
because the issue will be a major driving force for economic 
recovery.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- The government should 
compile new economic pump-priming measures before the scheduled 
Japan-U.S. summit in Washington on February 11, Japan's Vice 
Trade Minister suggested Monday [24 January]. Hideaki Kumano, 
vice minister of international trade and industry, told 
reporters that the U.S. Government should be informed of the 
contents of the economic stimulus package before the summit 
between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President 
Bill Clinton. 
  Kumano said his ministry and the Finance Ministry are 
holding 
working-level talks to coordinate views on the package. The 
package is expected to include major income tax cuts and an 
expanded budget for fiscal 1994, which begins next April 1.

House of Councillors. The economic measures had been widely 
expected to be implemented in late January.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- Bank of Japan [BOJ] 
Governor Yasushi Mieno said Monday [24 January] the economy 
remains mired in a slump with more time needed for recovery, but 
maintained his stance of keeping current monetary policy intact. 
  The economy "remains stagnant" with personal consumption and 
capital investment -- the key pillars of domestic demand -- 
"staying lackluster," Mieno said in an opening address to a 
two-day meeting of branch managers and overseas representatives. 
Against this backdrop, labor conditions have become "tougher," 
and the business sentiment has turned "more cautious," he added. 
  Although the latest fiscal and monetary measures are 
expected 
to continue showing their effects, an economic recovery seems to 
require "more time," Mieno said. But the central bank intends 
to watch the effects of past measures, he repeated, stressing 
that credit easing to date is "contributing to set the 
environment for macroeconomic recovery" by facilitating 
corporate restructuring programs. 
  Meanwhile, Mieno noted that lending by private financial 
institutions has remained weak and the money supply has 
continued to post low growth despite record-renewing drops in 
lending rates in line with the latest discount rate cut in 
September to an all-time low of 1.75 percent. 
  Mieno attributed the distant recovery outlook to cautious 
activities among companies and financial institutions stemming 
from lingering problems in clearing losses incurred during asset 
deflation after the collapse of the "bubble" economic boom of 
the late 1980s. 
  He also cited continued corporate restructuring in "trade 
divisions" to cope with the yen's appreciation. But Mieno 
reiterated that capital stock adjustments have progressed, and 
"pressure in this sense" is expected to "head toward easing." 
  Under these circumstances, Mieno called on banks to continue 
liquidating bad loans "steadily." He stressed the importance of 
"fully" utilizing market "vitality" in promoting adjustments and 
putting the economy on a path toward sustainable growth without 
inflation. 
  BOJ branch managers from 30 domestic branches and three 
overseas representatives gathered in Tokyo to report on the 
economic conditions of their repective areas. 
  Attention is fixed on whether the two-day meeting would lead 
the central bank to ease its monetary policy at a crucial time 
for the government that on Friday failed to pass the political 
reform bills through the upper house of the Diet. With the 
failure expected to cause a possible delay in the launching of a 
new fiscal package slated for this week, and with the market 
plunging again, hopes for a rate cut are rekindling after 
receding amid the stock market rally over the past week. 
  Tokyo stocks took a steep dive of more than 800 points in 
the 
key Nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues Monday morning.

  [Text] Communist guerrillas yesterday claimed 
responsibility for Monday's killing of a security officer in an 
automotive parts manufacturing company in Kalookan City. 
  The ambush came two days after the Alex Boncayao Brigade 
(ABB) released to media its target list of 345 lawmen, officials 
and civilians allegedly involved in drug trafficking, 
kidnapping, prostitution and gambling. 
  Killed was Carmelito G. Valmonte, 62, a retired inspector at 
the Western Police District Command. He died on the spot after 
sustaining four gunshot wounds, police said. 
  Four men and a woman reportedly opened fire with .45 caliber 
automatics on Valmonte as he was driving out of the compound of 
UE Automotive Manufacturing, Inc. (UEAMI) where he was security 
officer. 
  Paulo Ramirez, ABB spokesman, told the INQUIRER over the 
telephone that Valmonte was responsible for the violent 
dispersal of a workers' strike at the firm last year. 
  He said three workers were shot during the dispersal, one of 
whom was seriously wounded and his foot had to be amputated. 
  Ramirez said Valmonte was not on the ABB list but is 
considered "an enemy of the people and the revolution." 
  Mayor Alfredo Lim denounced the killing as "cowardly" and 
directed Senior Superintendent Hermogenes Ebdane, Manila police 
chief, to place his entire police force on alert. 
  Superintendent Romeo Maganto, Manila police chief for 
administration, said the 6,000-strong Manila Crusade for Peace 
and Democracy (MPCD) will be tapped to neutralize the ABB threat. 
  Maganto said the MCPD will serve as an intelligence network 
to gather information on the activities of suspected ABB members. 
  "We are not alarmed and we are not afraid. Mga langaw lang 
sila na nakadapo sa kalabaw (They are merely flies sitting atop 
a carabao)," Maganto said. 
  Maganto said several ABB leaders operating in Manila have 
already been identified, adding it would only be a matter of 
time before they are captured. 
  President Ramos himself has acknowledged the capability of 
ABB assassins to launch a fresh wave of attacks against hundreds 
of lawmen and officials allegedly engaged in crime and 
corruption. 
  Mr. Ramos said he has ordered a close watch on the ABB. 
  The Communist Party of the Philippines, led by Jose Maria 
Sison, ordered the ABB to disband in 1992 amid a public outcry 
against its indiscriminate killings. But anti-Sison cadres in 
the ABB defied the order.

  [Excerpt] Cotabato City -- Suspected communist rebels 
torched a passenger bus in Maasim, Sarangani, on Monday after 
the bus firm refused to pay "revolutionary tax," police said 
yesterday. 
  Senior Superintendent Jovito Sales, police director for 
Central Mindanao, said the bus of the Yellow Bus Line (YBL) was 
travelling from Kiamba, Sarangani, to General Santos City when 
it was blocked by about a dozen suspected New People's Army 
(NPA) guerrillas. Thirty of their comrades served as lookouts 
near the highway, police said. 
  The armed men ordered all passengers to alight and bring 
with 
them their belongings, witnesses told police. 
  They then poured gasoline all over the vehicle before 
setting 
it on fire. 
  No one was hurt or molested, police said. 
  Yellow Bus Line plies routes in South Cotabato, Sultan 
Kudarat, North Cotabato, Bukidnon and Davao. 
  Sales said the YBL management, prior to the incident, had 
received notes and letters demanding that the company pay 
"revolutionary tax" to the communist rebels. [passage omitted

  [Text] Pikit, North Cotabato -- Eight men of the Moro 
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and a two-year-old boy were 
killed Friday in a battle with elements of the Moro National 
Liberation Front (MNLF) in Barangay [village] Balatikan here, 
the 6th Infantry Division spokesman said Wednesday [19 January]. 
  Army Major Julasiri Kastiri, of the Army's 35th Infantry 
Battalion, said only two of the MILF fatalities were identified. 
They were Commander Camid Abalos and Commander Tatuan Mantukan, 
both of Barangay Kudal, Bagalungan, Maguindanao. 
  The identity of the child, who was hit by stray bullet, was 
also not immediately known. 
  Kastiri said some 100 MILF guerrillas on Friday came to 
Barangay Balatikan, burned two houses and carted away personal 
belongings of the farmers including an undetermined number of 
cattle. 
  MNLF rebels also operating in Barangay Balatikan defended 
the 
village and engaged the MILF guerrillas in a two-hour firefight. 
  The MILF rebels were led by Commanders Pakil Ayunan, Jack, 
Pendatun, Taez and Sumakon. Leaders on the MNLF side were 
Commanders Abdul Karim, Bacri and Kainudin Batoon. 
  Commander Pakil Ayunan is reputedly North Cotabato's most 
wanted criminal, tagged by police as the culprit in the massacre 
of 18 Christian farmers in Carmen town last 25 December. 
  He was also said to be responsible for a series of cattle 
rustling and harassment in the province. 
  The encounter site was five kilometers away from a 
government 
irrigation project in Barangay Maridagao where the MILF rebels 
were engaged as security men of a Korean construction firm, 
Shinsung Corporation. 
  A platoon of army troopers was dispatched to Balatikan to 
normalize the situation there after hundreds of residents fled 
to nearby villages.

  [Text] National Security Council secretary-general Gen 
Charan Kunlawanit says he is very satisfied with a compromise 
reached between Burma's rulers and some minority groups on a 
ceasefire ahead of peace talks. 
  The Burmese junta recently held peace talks with Kachin 
rebels in the north and with the Mon. 
  More talks were expected with other dissident minority 
groups 
such as the Karen and those in Shan state, Gen Charan said. 
  Earlier, the Karen National Union [KNU], the strongest 
anti-Rangoon minority group, called on the ruling State Law and 
Order Restoration Council to hold peace talks on equal terms 
with all minority groups to ensure rights and freedom in all 
economic social and political fields. 
  The KNU threatened not to talk if its conditions were not 
accepted by the SLORC. 
  Western sources criticised Rangoon's move as a deceitful 
tactic to get minorities to bow down to the junta. 
  They cited the government's refusal to release Nobel Peace 
Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi who has been under house arrest 
for five years. 
  Gen Charan said he did not know if Aung San Suu Kyi might be 
released, but he disagreed with the criticism, saying there was 
no reason for the junta to play a trick on the minorities as it 
might stir hatred and resistance. 
  "The Burmese junta is trying to be more open to the world 
community as the West is condemning its undemocratic system," 
said Gen Charan. 
  "However, we have to accept that change needs time. 
  "Thailand always supports peace talks and clings to the 
belief that any slaughter of minorities should be condemned by 
the world community." 
  Gen Charan spoke of Thailand's neutral stance on Burmese 
affairs, saying the Government would not interfere with the 
conflicts even though some minority groups which did not trust 
the Burmese government were asking for help from Thailand. 
  The talks might proceed well, he said. 
  One thorn still obstructs the peace in Burma, according to 
Gen Charan, as the junta has to attack the strongholds of opium 
warlord Khun Sa, who is notoriously influential in Shan State. 
  Khun Sa's group is believed to survive on money gained from 
trading in narcotics. 
  Shan State used to be the homeland of Thai Yai, but is now 
occupied by Chinese Haw and hill-tribe people. 
  Thailand and Burma are expected to hold talks on the opening 
of Tah Kee Lek checkpoint opposite Mae Sai district as the 
Burmese government is relaxing its regulations by allowing 
foreigners to cross the Thai border. 
  The move is to promote trade and tourism. 
  Tah Kee Lek used to be a permanent checkpoint but was closed 
after political upheavals in Burma. 
  Since then it has been opened on a temporary basis.

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai spoke with newsmen on 
23 January while on an inspection trip to Phetchabun Province 
about the proposal of Khun Sa, a world-renowned narcotics king 
and Shan State leader, for Thailand to help the Shan State 
become a narcotics-free zone. He said the Khun Sa question is 
Burma's business, not Thailand's. He added that Thailand cannot 
become involved in the issue. 
  In an earlier interview, Khun Sa said he wanted to create a 
heroin-free zone in Shan State. He urged Thai Prime Minister 
Chuan Likphai to coordinate with U.S. President Bill Clinton in 
pushing for a realization of the zone in order to avoid having 
to set aside funds for narcotics suppression. The purpose of 
Khun Sa's move is to gain the international community's 
recognition of the Shan State as an independent territory. Khun 
Sa asserted that the Shan State Government under his leadership 
has not supported opium cultivation; however, it has not been 
able to prevent its people from engaging in such cultivation.

  [Text] Sydney, Jan. 20 KYODO -- The North Korean 
Government wants to restore diplomatic relations with Australia 
which would end a 19-year-old severance of ties, acting Foreign 
Affairs Minister Gordan Bilney confirmed Thursday [20 January]. 
  North Korean and senior Australian officials have held 
secret 
talks at Australian Embassies in Jakarta and Bangkok, and the 
federal government has informed the United States, Japan and 
South Korea. 
  "But those talks have really essentially been about whether 
we should talk," Bilney said. 
  No decisions have been made about formal dialogue, which 
would be contingent upon three conditions, the Department of 
Foreign Affairs said in a statement. 
  Satisfactory progress must be made in the implementation of 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] safeguards and 
Australia "strongly supports" the U.S. negotiating stance on the 
nuclear issue, the statement said. 
  Australia would never play a "solo role" in putting 
relations 
with Korea at a normal footing and so progress would also be 
necessary in North Korea's relations with South Korea and the 
United States, it said. 
  Australia would also respect a call from North Korea's three 
adversaries not to reestablish ties. 
  Restoring ties relies strongly on whether North Korea will 
comply with U.S. pressure to allow international inspectors into 
its nuclear facilities. 
  Australia reportedly wants North Korea to rejoin the world 
community's economic and political affairs and would therefore 
be sympathetic to Pyongyang's reported proposal. 
  "North Korea...is an isolated country, and one can only 
speculate that perhaps it's feeling that isolation more now," 
Bilney said. 
  The Australian Government has considered inviting a senior 
North Korean Government official to visit Australia later in the 
year to initiate a stronger dialogue between the two countries. 
  While the step was entirely unsolicited, there were a number 
of possible reasons why Australia was approached, including the 
close relations with North Korea's main adversaries, the U.S., 
Japan and South Korea, the statement said. 
  Other reasons could include the fact that Australia 
currently 
chairs the IAEA Board of Governors and maintains a strong 
non-proliferation stance on nuclear weapons, the department 
said, adding that there have been sporadic contacts between 
Australia and North Korea in recent years. 
  Relations between Australia and North Korea were severed in 
1975 when the militant Communist government reacted to 
Australia's backing of South Korea in the United Nations by 
abandoning its embassy in Canberra and expelling Australian 
diplomats from Pyongyang.

  [Begin Bilney recording] There are a number of conditions

  [Text] North Korea's hardline communist regime is 
attempting to break the diplomatic ice with Australia, making an 
approach for the reestablishment of diplomatic links severed 
nearly 20 years ago. 
  Australia is encouraged by the approach, but it is insisting 
there be firm progress on the nuclear issue before ties could be 
resumed. Linda Mottram reports from Canberra: 
  [Begin Mottram recording] Australian officials have 
confirmed a report in the national newspaper THE AUSTRALIAN 
about the approach made in recent weeks by a senior North Korean 
diplomat to the Australian Embassy in Bangkok. An Australian 
Government spokesperson says Australian diplomats have returned 
the sounding-out. The spokesperson said the approach is being 
seen as encouraging, but says Pyongyang has been told any 
further development depends on North Korea allowing full 
international inspection of its nuclear facilities where nuclear 
weapons development is feared, and on progress in talks between 
North and South Korea and North Korea and the United States. 
  The spokesperson described the situation as talks about 
talks 
and very, very preliminary. Australia has informed South Korea 
of the approach which appeared to have been made to Australia 
only. [end recording]

  [Text] Australia's Federal Industry, Technology, and 
Regional Development Minister Alan Griffiths has resigned from 
cabinet pending a police inquiry into possible misuse of Labor 
Party's money. Michael Roland reports that Mr. Griffiths has 
told the prime minister, Paul Keating, he is confident his name 
will be cleared but it is best that he stands aside while the 
investigation is carried out. 
  In a statement issued late this afternoon, the prime 
minister 
says Mr. Griffiths has informed him he has serious concern about 
possible misuse of funds he received for party's political 
purposes. According to Mr. Keating, Mr. Griffiths has also 
expressed concern about the possible misuse of facilities in his 
Melbourne electorate office as well as irregularities in 
documentation relating to electoral fund-raising and expenditure. 
  The federal police have been asked to investigate. There 
will also be an independent inquiry into the matters raised. In 
the meantime, the industry minister has told Mr. Keating, it is 
in the best interest of the government and the ALP [Australian 
Labor Party] for him to resign so the matter can be fully 
investigated. Mr. Griffiths has told the prime minister he is 
confident of being found not guilty of any wrongdoing or 
impropriety and he intends recontesting his position once the 
inquiries are over. Mr. Griffiths entered the ministry in 1990 
and was promoted to the industry portfolio after last year's 
federal election.

relief in Kenya. The aid is to help counter the effects of 
conflict and drought which have left an estimated one and a half 
million people in urgent need of assistance. Kenya also has 
around 400,000 refugees forced to flee from conflict and 
instability in Sudan, Somalia, and Ethiopia. 
  Australia's Development Cooperation Minister Gordon Bilney 
says the aid will go towards a supplementary feeding program 
aimed at reducing malnutrition in women and children. Funds 
will also be spent on blood testing kits to screen for the AIDS 
virus, HIV, while further assistance will go to drought 
rehabilitation, specially, in Kenya's northwest.

  [Text] Suva, Jan 20 (AFP) -- Fijian President Ratu Sir 
Kamisese Mara has officially dismissed parliament and announced 
national elections to be held from February 18 to 25. 
  "The president has advised the prime minister, the 
honourable 
Major General (Sitiveni) Rabuka, of his decision," a government 
statement said Wednesday. 
  Rabuka called for the dissolution of parliament when his 
budget was defeated November 29 by seven dissident members of 
government who voted against it in the House of Representatives. 
  Dominance of the ruling Fijian Political Party has been 
challenged by a breakaway party, the Fijian Association, which 
is led by former deputy prime minister Josevata Kamikamica. 
  Fiji's 1990 constitution gives indigenous Fijians the right 
to hold the premiership and a guaranteed 37 seats in the 70-seat 
lower house. 
  Indian Fijians have 27 seats, other races have five and the 
Polynesian island of Rotuma has one. 
  Polling is spread over a week to allow for voting in 
outlying 
Fijian islands.

  [Text] A spokesman for the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry on 
Friday reasserted Vietnam sovereignty over the Spratly and the 
Paracel islands groups. He said both groups of islands come 
under Vietnam sovereignty because Vietnam was the first to 
discover them in the 17th century, and has been exercising its 
genuine ownership over them in a continuous and peaceful manner. 
  The Vietnamese spokesman was speaking in an interview to the 
army paper QUAN DOI NHAN DAN following remarks made last Friday 
by a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman who claimed Chinese 
sovereignty over these two islands groups while rejecting 
Vietnam's right over the land. 
  He said Vietnam has been trying to resolve the issue through 
peaceful means in keeping with international laws and with 
consistency, and will continue to do so in the future.

Vietnam Seventh Central Committee's political report delivered 
by General Secretary Do Muoi at the opening of the Mid-Term 
National Party Conference at the Ba Dinh Conference Hall in 
Hanoi on 20 January -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] 3. The third achievement involves our diplomatic 
activities. Vietnam's relations with foreign countries have 
expanded and its prestige and position in the international 
arena has been enhanced. This creates a favorable 
international situation to build and defend the fatherland. 
  The seventh national party congress asserted Vietnam's 
foreign policy of firmly maintaining peace, expanding the 
relations of friendship and cooperation, creating favorable 
international conditions for the cause of national construction 
and defense, and positively contributing to the world people's 
common struggle for peace, national independence, democracy, and 
social progress. 
  The congress stressed Vietnam's broad-minded foreign policy 
of befriending all countries in the world and struggling for 
peace, independence, and progress. The party Central 
Committee's third plenum concretized and seriously implemented 
this policy against the background of new changes in the region 
and the world and following the seventh national party congress. 
  We positively expanded our diplomatic activities and scored 
very significant achievements. We restored normal relations 
with the People's Republic of China and developed the relations 
of friendship and cooperation with the country a further step. 
We strengthened and enhanced the special solidarity with the 
Lao People's Democratic Republic. We cosigned the Paris Accord 
on Cambodia. We struggled for its serious implementation, 
established friendly and neighborly relations with the Kingdom 
of Cambodia, and promoted and opened up a new stage of 
cooperation and friendship with ASEAN and its organizations. We 
also expanded relations with other countries in the Asia-Pacific 
Region, maintained and developed the existing relations of 
cooperation with the Russian Federation and states of the former 
Soviet Union, and East European countries. We preserved and 
developed our traditional relations with Cuba, India, and the 
DPRK; continued to support the legitimate causes of the 
Palestinian, Asian, and South African peoples; and expanded 
relations with developing countries in the Middle East, Africa, 
and Latin America. We positively contributed to the 
consolidation and development of the Nonaligned Movement's role 
in the new situation, and also improved relations with Western 
and Northern European countries, the EC, Japan, Canada, 
Australia, New Zealand, and a number of new industrial 
countries. We restored normal relations with international 
financial and monetary organizations, and made progress in the 
struggle for the lifting of the U.S. embargo and for normalizing 
relations with the United States. 
  II. Shortcomings and Newly Arising Problems 
  1. Our economy still depends on agriculture, which is still 
backward. Our industries are small, infrastructure is poorly 
developed, material-technical bases are very few, the 
accumulations attained from the internal economy are minimal, 
and investment and development are not great enough. 
Productivity and economic results are low, although our 
economic growth is acceptable. Our production capability, which 
is in the stage of developing for mobilization in the days 
ahead, is not up to par. This will affect adversely economic 
growth in the years to come. Our capability to curb inflation 
is not consistent, while the budget deficit continues. Budget 
overdrafts are high and foreign debt payments, which are due, 
are too immense to be settled because our annual export values 
are still minimal. Meanwhile, many sectors, localities, units, 
and leading and managerial cadres are not maintaining firmly 
their awareness in practicing thrift and diligence, thereby 
causing great losses to public property while lavish spending is 
prevalent. 
  It is necessary to say that our national and cooperative 
economies slowly have developed and strengthened. Our national 
economy has not satisfactorily assumed its active role in 
production and circulation. The state-run business sector 
missed good chances to develop many important domains and areas, 
and this allowed a group of private traders to exploit these 
opportunities and cause difficulties for both our producers and 
consumers. We have not completely overcome obstacles in the 
private economy. We have difficulties in production development 
and experience a lack of good management and guidance. 
Moreover, illegal trade is still prevalent. 
  We realize that our economic mechanism is at a nascent stage 
with many spontaneously arising factors; our state management 
capability is still low and optimally cannot develop the 
strength of the market economic mechanism nor contain its many 
negative sides. Our legal system is not complete while its 
implementation is not seriously carried out. Planning and 
activities for financial and banking sectors are still poor and 
are fraught with negative practices. The goods distribution 
system is irrational and it is carried out in an arbitrary 
fashion. The principle of distributing incomes in accordance 
with labor is not been strictly observed. 
  2. Cultural and Social Domains 
  Many great and urgent issues are still not resolved, 
although 
we scored some achievements in these domains. Unemployment, 
especially for youth of working age, is still the pressing issue 
and is one of the fundamental factors causing negative practices 
in our society. 
  Social policy is not implemented justly. Many people 
legally amass wealth, but many others get rich quickly through 
illegal business activities. At the same time, many families 
who rendered meritorious service to the nation, sacrificed 
lives, and suffered great loss during the wars are still facing 
great hardship. The number of poor and starving people still 
accounts for a significant part of the population. The people's 
lives in many areas -- specially the highland, isolated, and 
ethnic-inhabited areas -- are still destitute. 
  Education is inadequate in both quality and efficiency. Many 
issues relating to curriculum and training methods have not been 
defined to suit development requirements. Many schools are 
degrading seriously. Laboratory and scientific research 
equipment is scarce and outdated. Pedagogical schools and 
teachers provide poor training and education service, which is 
causing great public concern. Education management cadres at 
all levels hardly are given proper training. Individual 
education expenses are too high, which affects the education of 
children from poor families. 
  Funding for scientific and technological research is higher 
than before, but still too low to meet the demand. It is only 
about 1 percent of the total state budget. Therefore, it must 
be thinly spread to different areas. The result of this level 
of funding is limited returns. Measures and regulations have 
not been introduced to encourage economic enterprises to invest 
in this field. 
  Different scientific groups have not been formed. The 
organic [huwux cow] relationship among scientific research 
establishments, training institutions, and production units has 
not been established. The import of foreign technologies has 
been poorly managed and led to the import of outdated 
technologies and equipment at high prices. This causes 
long-term negative effects for the nation. 
  The situation relating to culture and arts is causing great 
concern. The lifestyle of running after money, unhealthy 
interests, bad customary habits, and superstitions is on the 
increase. Poisonous and dangerous cultural products are readily 
available in the market. Incorrect tendencies -- such as the 
rejection of our revolution's achievements and our revolutionary 
culture and arts, the detachment of arts from the party's 
political line, the tendency to commercialize the arts, and the 
spread of bad foreign-influenced arts and debauched lifestyles 
-- are appearing in creative, logical, and critical works. 
These mistakes and incorrect conceptions were mentioned by the 
fourth plenum of the seventh party Central Committee, but they 
slowly are improving. Guidance by party organs and the state 
management over the cultural and arts work is weak. 
  Our public health service is not meeting the minimum 
requirements of society. Grassroots health care is weak. 
Hospitals are ill- equipped and provide low standards of 
service and care. The increase in population is still higher 
than 2.2 percent. This high rate obstructs socioeconomic 
development, improvements to life, and affects the development 
of our race. 
  Despite many efforts to contain them, social vices tend to 
increase -- especially drug addiction, gambling, prostitution, 
and robbery. Corruption and smuggling are prevalent, raising 
public indignation, and greatly affecting the people's 
confidence in the party and state. 
  3. The political situation is stable, but many complicated 
factors which must not be overlooked still exist. Many party 
and state organs have not been clean and strong. Political 
security is not really firm. Social order and safety are not 
safeguarded. The renovation line on party building has not been 
satisfactorily implemented. The party mechanism is heavy and 
bulky and its management method and work attitudes slowly are 
being renovated. The leadership quality and result of many party 
committees are still low. They even sidestep the party line in 
some places. 
  Cadre-related work is a weak chain. The cadre contingent, 
generally speaking, is not up to its duties or requirements. In 
many places, difficulties and embarrassment are experienced when 
able cadres are needed for appointment to key leading positions. 
There are not enough qualified cadres and leading specialists to 
take care of party work, state management, production and 
business, external economic relations, religion, ethnic 
communities, and women-related work. 
  The planning, training, fostering, and assigment of cadres 
are not performed well. Party committees are not giving proper 
attention to checking the observation of party regulations, 
lines, and policies. The reform of the state mechanism is slow 
and lacks efficiency. The evil practices of authoritarianism, 
oppression, vindictiveness, bureaucracy, and indiscipline are 
prevalent in many places. 
  The fatherland fronts and mass organizations are still 
facing 
difficulties in the contents of work and methods. The number of 
cadres working in mass organizations is not stable. They lack 
enthusiasm about their work and they are not given appropriate 
care, training, and benefits. 
  Confusion and lack of vigilance are still prevalent among 
our party cadres and people. They still have a low level of 
awareness regarding sabotage plots and activities by hostile 
forces, who always wish to scrap the party and socialism from 
our country. Some party cadres remain unconcerned in the face of 
wrong viewpoints or activities that are aimed at stirring up 
social disorder. Others have deviated seriously from the 
socialist path, or are even inclined to choose another path. 
  Our ideological and theoretical work is still slow, is not 
sharp enough, lacks militancy, and is not able to respond 
convincingly to newly emerging issues. Many party cadres, 
including core leaders, are still sluggish when it comes to 
self-education. They lack efforts to improve one's own 
character and understanding. Disunity among cadres at some 
party organizations is also very serious. 
  III. Generalizations 
  Despite the shortcomings we need to overcome, our past 
important achievements are creating favorable conditions for the 
country to advance gradually to a new development stage -- the 
stage of industrialization and modernization for our country. 
These conditions consist of many elements of stature and trend, 
both material and spiritual, economic, politic, social, and 
cultural, and both domestic and overseas. The reality of past 
years allows us to assert that the lines and main policies of 
our party on renovation were correct; the steps taken 
appropriate. The resolutions of the sixth and seventh party 
congresses are being absorbed in the life of our people. 
  Reviewing reality of renovation brings up many useful 
lessons. It is necessary to determine that the first experiences 
learned through the renovation process and pointed out by the 
seventh party congress need to be developed and applied to our 
current reality. Those were the lessons of maintaining firmly 
the socialist path during the renovation process, combining the 
determination of the revolutionary principles and strategies 
with flexibility in policies and sensibility to the changes. 
There were also the lessons of the necessity to renovate 
comprehensively and harmoniously, and to apply appropriate 
steps, contents, and methodologies. Other lessons learned were 
to safeguard firmly the party leadership role and the state 
management role during the process of developing a multisector 
merchandise economy and socialist democracy as well as the need 
for timely exposure and handling problems, which arise during 
the renovation process. We also need to pay appropriate 
attention to the task of reviewing reality and continuously 
completing and perfecting the theories to build the socialist 
path of our country. 
  Renovation is a difficult process which is unprecedented, 
but 
we have been bravely searching, learning, and achieving 
important progress. The most basic, decisive factor was the 
determination of our party to retain its leadership position; to 
reject pluralism and a multiparty political system; to honor the 
spirit of independence, self-determination, and innovation; and 
to follow correct lines and policies, which are in good 
accordance with the rules and reality of Vietnam. Our party has 
also been able to develop the total strength of the great 
all-people solidarity block and expand international cooperation. 
  The seventh party congress outlined six characteristics for 
the socialist society our people are building. The congress 
also pointed out seven basic directions to make these 
characteristics a reality. This is the socialist direction that 
the conferences of the seventh Central Committee materialized 
into practical directives. 
  The building of the socialism, however, is still new to us. 
It requires from us massive energy to research, to study, and 
to discover. We will be able to figure out more clearly the 
socialist path for our country by continuously reviewing our 
work and studying ideological theory. We will also be able to 
figure out the concrete model for each domain of economy, 
politics, and social and cultural fields. We have to encourage 
innovation and development of Marxism-Leninism-Ho Chi Minh 
Thought, especially Leninist thoughts on a new economic policy 
and the state-managed capitalism. This will help invent new 
forms of transition and diversified intermediary steps which 
suit our concrete historical circumstances and which will help 
our country advance firmly on the socialist path.

Central Committee's political report delivered by General 
Secretary Do Muoi at the opening of the Mid-Term National Party 
Conference at the Ba Dinh Conference Hall in Hanoi on 20 January 
-- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Part Two: Essential tasks to be carried out in the 
period ahead. 
  Laying ahead of our people are major challenges and 
opportunities. These challenges are: 
  -- The danger of being further left behind economically, 
compared with many countries in the region and the world due to 
the fact that we started from the lowest point, and that our 
growth rate is not high and steady enough, while having to 
struggle upward in a fiercely competitive environment. 
  -- The danger of straying off the course of socialism if we 
fail to abide by implementation guidelines. 
  -- The scourge of corruption and other social ills. 
  -- Peaceful evolution-related schemes and actions of hostile 
forces. 
  Yet, we also enjoy many fundamental advantages: 
  -- Our party has a correct policy line and it is united and 
single-minded. 
  -- Our people are diligent, intelligent, and patriotic. They 
have good abilities and firm revolutionary willpower and believe 
in the party leadership. 
  -- Our armed forces are absolutely loyal to the 
revolutionary 
cause of our party and people. 
  -- The successes obtained in the renovation process are 
creating our new posture and strengths. 
  -- The development of the scientific and technological 
revolution and the trend toward broadening world and regional 
ties of cooperation and development have brought to us 
opportunities to obtain more important resources. 
  The general targets set forth by the Seventh Party Congress 
for the period until 1995 will consist of overcoming 
difficulties and ordeals, stabilizing and developing 
socioeconomic activities, strengthening political stability, 
dispelling negativism and social injustices, and basically 
tiding the country over the current crisis. 
  Over the past two and a half years, we have achieved a 
significant part of that target, especially the economic ones. 
For the remaining years of our office, we must motivate the 
entire party, people, and army to be of the same heart and mind; 
to exert extraordinary efforts; to uphold a sense of 
independence, sovereignty, and self reliance; to broaden 
international relations; practice the motto of industry, thrift, 
integrity and righteousness; strive to exploit our advantages; 
dispel dangers; overcome ordeals; and successfully achieve the 
general targets cited above. We must quicken our pace to 
achieve the various aims of the strategy for socioeconomic 
stability and development until the year 2000, in a bid to build 
a powerful country, a prosperous people, and an equal and 
civilized society. 
  The following are essential tasks: 
  1. To press for changes in the economic structure in the 
direction of industrialization and modernization. 
  Socioeconomic improvements, together with the expansion and 
strengthening of development cooperation with various countries 
and international organizations, have allowed us to press ahead 
by another step our national industrialization and modernization 
to create more jobs, speed up the pace of economic growth, and 
further renovate the people's material and spiritual life. This 
is a central task of foremost importance for the period ahead. 
  Industrialization and modernization are the ways to avoid 
the 
danger of being further left behind, compared to nearby 
countries; to maintain political and social stability; to 
protect independence and sovereignty as well as the course of 
socialist development. 
  At present, we have not followed the old pattern of 
industrialization. We will not repeat the mistakes, hastiness, 
and subjectiveness that the Sixth Party Congress has criticized. 
Industrialization is in fact to build the material-technical 
bases of socialism. This is not a simple question of increasing 
the pace and proportion of industrial production in the economy. 
Rather, it is a process of structural changes linked with 
radical technological renovation to build a foundation for rapid 
growth and high and long- lasting efficiency for the entire 
national economy. 
  Industrialization must be accompanied by modernization and 
this requires the combination of gradual steps of industrial 
development with efforts to seize opportunities to shorten our 
process and to form spearheads of development to catch up with 
scientific and technological progress in the world. 
  The orientation, scale, and steps of the process of 
industrialization and modernization must be carefully thought 
out through a complete understanding of the following important 
points: 
  -- The firm maintenance of independence and sovereignty must 
go along with the broadening of international cooperation, 
building an open-door economy both at home and abroad, 
multilateralizing and diversifying relations with other 
countries, combining economic activities with national defense 
and security, and linking economic growth with social progress 
and social justice, and with cultural development and 
environmental protection. 
  -- Persisting on the strategy of directing vigorous efforts 
at exports while replacing imports that can be produced locally. 
  -- Developing the comparative advantages of the entire 
country as well as each area, sector, and domain in a given 
period. 
  -- Constantly improving the competitiveness in local, 
regional, and international markets. 
  -- Taking socioeconomic results as a fundamental standard 
for 
determining the course of development and for selecting 
investment and technological projects. 
  -- Rapidly exploiting the strengths of the entire country, 
of 
each region, and sector; appropriately gathering resources for 
the various fields of activity and various key areas to promptly 
produce high results while paying attention to meeting essential 
requirements, working out practical policies, systems, and 
measures for localities which have difficulties; stepping up 
development cooperation, and ensuring that various regions and 
strata of people can benefit from the results of economic growth. 
  -- Attention must be paid to small- and medium-size projects 
that require small capital investments and capital that can be 
recovered quickly in accordance with the motto of using 
short-term projects to finance long-term ones. 
  -- Building a number of necessary, large-scale projects. 
  -- Making intensive capital investments to exploit to the 
fullest our productivity and our existing technologies with an 
emphasis on projects that affect product competitiveness. 
  -- Combining traditional technologies with modern 
technologies, ensuring the advanced nature of imported equipment 
and technologies, giving priority to technologies that need 
small capital but which directly or indirectly create more jobs. 
  -- From now until the end of this decade, great attention 
must be paid to agricultural industrialization and to the rural 
economy. We must carry out comprehensive agricultural, forestry, 
and fishery development in conjunction with efforts to develop 
processing industries for agricultural, forestry, and marine 
products and for consumer goods manufacturing and exports. 
  -- Expanding trade, travel, and services in both urban and 
rural areas and stepping up other overseas economic activities. 
  -- Renovating, expanding, upgrading, and selectively 
building 
infrastructure facilities in the most difficult areas where 
development is being hindered. 
  -- Selectively building heavy industries establishments in 
important sectors where there are pressing requirements and in 
which we have conditions in terms of capital, technologies, and 
marketplace to achieve rapid development and high results. 
  -- Developing scientific and technological studies and 
application, education and training, public health, and 
environmental protection to meet immediate and long-term 
development requirements. 
  While exploiting comparative advantages such as cheap labor, 
resources, and a convenient location, we must study and read 
regional and world development trends, the strategies and 
policies of trading partners and rival competitors, and attempt 
to discover new opportunities and comparative advantages. We 
must foster and develop to the fullest our most decisive 
resource, namely the Vietnamese population, for long-term 
development and to prepare the necessary conditions for 
development along this course. 
  To carry out industrialization and modernization, we must 
mobilize various sources of capital in conjunction with 
effective efforts to manage our capital, with the domestic 
source of capital being regarded as crucial and the foreign 
source of capital as important. 
  To ensure an average annual growth rate of not less than 
eight percent, we must promptly increase the total amount of 
investment to over 20 percent of the GDP within the next few 
years. This must be higher in the ensuing years along with 
efforts to improve the efficiency of capital management. This 
requires great efforts and appropriate policies to encourage the 
entire society to practice thrift in production and consumption 
and to concentrate on investing in production, especially in 
material production. 
  Concentrated investment earmarked from the state budget is 
decisive for the growth of the entire economy. It is necessary 
to increase the sources of investment capital in targeted 
projects by allocating a greater part of the GDP to the state 
budget and by attracting all sources of aid and low interest 
loans given by various governments and international financial 
and monetary organizations. We must audit, inspect, closely 
manage, distribute and effectively use our existing public 
assets, and must guard against losses and wasteful spending. 
  The state's capital investment is designed mainly for 
building the socioeconomic infrastructure and a number of key, 
spearhead industrial establishments, and processing industries 
for agricultural, forestry, and marine products, for the 
manufacture of export goods, and to cater to export services. 
Part of this investment must also be reserved for financing 
employment projects and projects to reforest wastelands and bare 
hills and expand aquaculture and deep sea fishing activities. 
  The state will only allocate invested capital to 
socioeconomic infrastructure projects and to areas where the 
capital is not likely to be recovered. As for the credit loans 
invested by the government, it must be returned by users. 
  We must renovate our managerial mechanism in capital 
construction to prevent negativism, waste, and misappropriation 
of state-owned capital, especially in planning activities. We 
must determine unit price in construction and must verify the 
results of the projects. We must use support services, verify 
product qualities, [words indistinct] of highly credible local 
and foreign companies in this area. Each project must have a 
supervisor. If it is a project where the capital must be 
recovered, then full amount must be recovered for the state and 
within schedule. 
  We must find all ways to be thrifty and to invest in 
development projects of the people and in various firms 
belonging to various economic components under various forms. 
This must be done in such a way as to ensure that the 
potentialities are mobilized and every cent invested will yield 
profit. We must gradually increase the proportion of this 
source of capital in the total capital investment of the entire 
society.

Vietnam Seventh Central Committee's political report delivered 
by General Secretary Do Muoi at the opening of the Mid-Term 
National Party Conference at the Ba Dinh Conference Hall in 
Hanoi on 20 January -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] We must strive to consistently implement the policy 
on developing the multisectoral economy and give various 
economic components and business establishments more headway to 
develop quickly and attain strong economic results. Efforts 
must be made to strengthen and improve state-run business 
establishments to help them effectively carry out their 
activities so as to take an active role in the economy. This is 
a very important and urgent task because it will help to 
encourage and support other economic sectors in their 
development while accelerating rapid and long-lasting economic 
growth. It is an apparatus with material strength that will 
help the state to regulate and lead the market economy to 
develop further in accordance with the socialist orientations. 
  It is necessary for us to be able to distinguish the nature 
of state ownership from that of state-run business. We must 
realize that assets and capital belonging to the state are used 
in various forms to ensure strong socioeconomic results and to 
enhance the state capability in accelerating and controlling 
economic activities. Investment in state-run business should 
include enterprises set up with a 100-percent state capital and 
those with the majority shares held by the state so as to allow 
the state to effectively control these establishments. 
  Efforts must be made to allocate land and forest areas to 
the 
people on a long-term basis, to give leases or provide 
concessions for exploiting mineral mines, to enter into joint 
business ventures, and to buy shares from enterprises of other 
sectors. We must integrate efforts to strengthen state-run 
business in various sectors, areas, and socioeconomic 
infrastructure projects; in the financial, banking, and 
insurance establishments; and in a number of key production and 
service units so as to help the national economy develop 
strongly. It is necessary to encourage other economic components 
to participate in these tasks in different forms and degrees. 
  In carrying out these tasks, we can reduce the number of 
inessential state-run business establishments while 
consolidating, expanding, and building new essential state-run 
enterprises. We must strive to strengthen and develop state-run 
business in agriculture, forestry, and fishery in the direction 
of joining and cooperating with other business branches to build 
industrial and service centers -- especially for the processing 
industry -- scientific-technological centers, and cultural and 
social centers in localities throughout the country. 
  We must strive to strengthen and improve the state-run trade 
system, to firmly control the export-import business and trading 
of essential materials, to regulate the wholesale and retail 
trades, and together with other sectors to stabilize and develop 
the local markets. Efforts must be made to ensure a smooth 
transportation of goods, to serve and accelerate production 
development, to protect the interest of producers and consumers, 
and to make fundamental changes in the organization and 
management mechanism of state-run business in order to ensure 
the autonomous operation of business establishments in the 
market economic system while ensuring effective control by the 
state. 
  The fundamental factors leading to ineffective operations, 
negative practices, and waste at many state-run business 
establishments are due to the fact that we do not have certain 
people who act as direct owners of state assets and who take 
responsibility for and protect the interests of state 
properties. We have no attractive and firm motives to encourage 
personnel and workers at various state-run enterprises to devote 
their energies to the development of their establishments. We 
still lack the material and organizational strength to 
decisively define various working methods of curbing corruption 
and acts which cause losses to public properties. We must find 
ways of overcoming these shortcomings. 
  To attract more capital, create a driving force to curb 
negativism, and accelerate the profitability of state-run 
business, we must introduce various forms of shareholding 
enterprises in line with our production and business system, and 
with the majority shares held by the state. We must step by 
step apply the method of selling shares to personnel and workers 
who work at enterprises. Efforts must be made to distribute 
profits to personnel and workers, based on their base salary and 
the numbers of their shares. We should conduct a pilot project 
to sell a number of shares of state-run business establishments 
to private organizations and individuals. 
  On the introduction of a share holding enterprise system, 
we will stipulate the organization of management boards 
comprising representatives of state shareholders, workers 
shareholders, and other shareholders. Regulations and selection 
criteria to help management boards select managing directors 
should be set up. Work contracts in various forms with workers 
should be applied in a widespread manner and be perfected 
continuously within state enterprises. The state will support 
and encourage the implementation, in accordance with the 
development needs of the economy, and renovation of enterprise 
unions and general corporations into the organization of 
business conglomerates, thus avoiding intermediary 
administrative authorities. The system of managing ministries, 
managing administration authorities, and the distinction between 
centrally-managed enterprises and locally- managed enterprises 
will be gradually discarded. 
  State authorities at all levels and sectors should take care 
of and assist state enterprises in their businesses, especially 
in matters relating to capital, technology, marketing, and cadre 
training and deployment. For enterprises which serve 
socioeconomic public benefits which suffer low income or loss, 
the state will have a reasonable relief policy which discourages 
reliability. The state will have clear regulations on the 
state's inspection authority and stop the inspection and control 
work in an ad hoc style which is inconvenient to the businesses. 
For state enterprises doing business in non-essential areas who 
suffer extended losses and lack the capacity to overcome these 
losses, the resolute measures pointed out at the second plenum 
of the seventh Central Committee should be applied. 
  We will continue to renovate the economic establishment of 
cooperatives and develop the independent role of cooperative 
members. The state supports, assists, and guides the 
development of all cooperative economic establishments in 
various economic sectors on a voluntary and mutually beneficial 
basis. Management of the cooperatives should be democratic and 
encourage combining the strength of the cooperative with the 
strength of each household member. 
  The renovation of cooperatives and other cooperative 
economic 
establishments should be carried out in all sectors of 
agriculture, forestry, and fishery in accordance with the 
resolutions of the seventh Central Committee's fifth plenum. 
Strict measures will be applied in handling the sluggish 
cooperatives and experimental renovation in all forms of 
cooperative economic establishments in handicrafts, financial 
credit, trading, and service and should be continued. 
Cooperatives can function on a larger scale, performing various 
branches of business and are not restricted within any 
administrative boundaries. Besides the capital contributed by 
members and the assets of the cooperatives, capital and labor 
from outsiders should be motivated. Members of cooperatives 
receive incomes which are subjected to contributed labor and 
shares. Cooperatives can exercise any of the various levels of 
collectivity of production supplies in accordance with business 
necessity, aspirations, and benefit of the members. 
  The individual and small business economic sector, which 
comprises mostly family business establishments, is speedily 
growing and possesses tremendous potential to become an 
important element of the economy. We must have a policy to help 
this sector in terms of capital, technology, market information, 
and so forth in order to help their businesses become effective, 
thus creating more employment and more opportunities for 
individuals to contribute to the national construction. We must 
also guide and encourage individual business establishments to 
gradually join cooperative economic establishments on a 
voluntary basis. 
  The private capital economic sector, both overseas and 
domestic, is growing fast and contributing positively to the 
national construction. The state continues to encourage private 
capital economic activities in sectors and areas allowed by law. 
The state also protects legal rights and benefits of private 
businessmen, joins development and investment funds with these 
businessmen on the basis of consensus, and encourages them to 
sell prioritized shares to their workers. The state helps and 
guides them to overcome difficulties and do business in 
accordance with state laws and regulations. Concrete 
regulations will be promulgated to stipulate the state 
management role towards business establishments with capital 
invested directly by outsiders. 
  In combination with inspection and control functions of the 
state, we need to develop the grassroots organizations of the 
party, trade unions, and politico-social mass organizations 
within the private business enterprises and joint business 
enterprises either domestically or with overseas partners. 
These grassroots organizations will contribute to productivity, 
protect legal benefits of workers, and prevent illegal deeds. 
We should create conditions and a legal environment for lawful 
competition activities and for developing collective businesses 
on a voluntary and mutually beneficial basis, regardless of the 
disparity between these businesses in a sector or locality. 
  Using the major state enterprises as the bases, we will form 
business corporations with a significant ability to compete in 
the domestic as well as international markets.

  [Text] Dear friends: Today, 22 January, the delegates of 
the Mid-Term National Party Conference [MNPC] continued their 
debate on the seventh party Central Committee political report 
at the conference hall. 
  The conference listened to 19 opinions expressed by 
delegates 
of different sectors, localities, and the armed forces. The 
opinions were almost totally in agreement with the political 
report on the achievements scored in the last two years, the 
four challenging dangers, and the main duties in the coming 
period. 
  Most of the opinions concentrated on the analysis of the 
four 
challenging dangers. They emphasized the possibility that our 
country might be left behind at a great distance by regional and 
other countries. They said that economic lagging also has 
political meaning because it is the manifestation of a backward 
general policy and not a practical economic policy. 
  Regarding the danger of peaceful evolution against socialism 
from enemies, the delegates held that it is not only an external 
danger but an internal danger as well. The reality of the 
situation is that many reactionary groups have returned from 
foreign countries to oppose and sabotage our country. This 
danger, if we are not vigilant, it will become a reality. 
  With respect to corruption, the opinions held that 
corruption 
is not only practiced by a few people, but it resembles an 
organization which operates from a system existing in state 
organs. Corruption it not only tied to a conception of 
morality, it also carries political meaning. Therefore, in 
order to stop this danger, uniform measures must be applied. 
The first of these measures is the education of cadres and 
party members. In the implementation of a market mechanism and 
door-open policy to the outside world, we need to further 
strengthen the consolidation of our armed forces and the 
maintenance of social security and order. 
  Through analysis, most of the delegates held that the basic 
nature of these four dangers is the class struggle and who will 
triumph over whom. 
  As for future duties, the delegates discussed the 
definitions 
of the terms of transferring economic structures and developing 
industry with regard to the modernization of the national 
economy. They said the transfer of economic structures creates 
great values for key leading industries on the basis of 
exploiting national potential and intelligence. Therefore, we 
must continue to pay attention to economic development and 
investment for mountainous and Central Highland areas. In 
industrial development, we have to strengthen processing 
industries and improve tree planting structures in agricultural 
areas. By doing so, these areas can provide raw materials for 
different industrial sectors. We must increase our exports and 
encourage the use of our locally made products. 
  Tomorrow, 23 January, the MNPC delegates will continue to 
work at the conference hall.

  [Text] Today, 23 January, the delegates to the Mid-Term 
National Party Conference continued to work in the conference 
hall. Altogether, 19 delegates contributed their views to the 
party Central Committee's political report. 
  During today's animated and serious debates, the delegates 
pointed out the important success of the renovation undertaking 
two years following the seventh party congress. The 
socioeconomic achievements, which we scored at a time when the 
socialist camp has ceased to exist and the former Soviet Union 
has collapsed further, testify to our party's clearsighted 
leadership and to the correctness of the application of 
Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh thought to the specific 
conditions in Vietnam. The evaluation results of the political 
report are accurate and modest. 
  Regarding the four menacing dangers, most of the views held 
that they are interrelated. They felt no single danger should 
be considered the most serious one, and that all dangers must be 
traced back to objective and subjective causes. We must take 
precautions against them as a result. Some opinions, however, 
maintained that one should not call these as dangers, but rather 
basic challenges which could obstruct our renovation policy and 
national construction and defense efforts. These dangers will 
exert a more adverse impact on us if we are not strong enough. 
  Regarding the key tasks for the days ahead, the delegates 
attached much importance to the need to improve our economic 
infrastructure, build more industrial bases, and carry out the 
industrialization program step by step to benefit key areas of 
the country. Priority investment in mountain regions and areas 
where difficulties abound is necessary. It is important to pay 
due attention to nationalities-related issues and formulate 
economic development policies to benefit mountain, border, and 
island areas. The delegates discussed mass mobilization and 
party building work and maintained that our party has attached 
importance to mass mobilization work since the seventh party 
congress. Progress has been made in this domain. This is an 
important cause leading to recent achievements. Our party 
should pay attention to training for cadres in charge of mass 
mobilization work and formulate appropriate policies for cadres 
in order to develop mass mobilization work a step further. 
  Regarding party-building work, the delegates maintained that 
our party is large in size but is not as strong as it should be. 
For the party to be strong enough to direct the entire people 
in national construction, measures must be taken to consolidate 
grass- roots party organizations, especially party chapters at 
villages and city wards. More vigorous efforts are needed to 
purify grass-roots party organizations. Deviant and degenerate 
party members definitely must be expelled from the party. On 
the anti-corruption front, it is necessary to clarify corruption 
cases involving party cadres and members as well as take 
appropriate action against them. It is important to consider the 
possibility of making influential cadres declare their assets. 
  Regarding culture and art, many delegates also stressed the 
need for the party to look after the well-being of cadres in 
charge of artistic activities and talented artists of both sexes 
so they all can have a sense of security while engaging in 
creative work to serve the people. It is necessary to work out 
an appropriate pay scale and a long-term training program. 
  Tomorrow, 24 January, the delegates to the Mid-Term National 
Party Conference will continue to work in groups.

  [Text] Hanoi, Jan 24 (AFP) -- A conference of Vietnam's 
ruling communist party, which started last week, has revealed 
divisions among its delegates on the country's economic reforms, 
the party daily Nhan Dan reported Monday. 
  Most of the 647 delegates expressed their support for the 
results of the policy of "doi moi", or renovation, that was 
launched in 1986, but there was sharp debate on how to assess 
future problems and how to resolve them, it said. 
  The delegates wind up their meeting in Hanoi on Tuesday. 
  Debate, which began Thursday, has focussed in particular on 
"the importance of ideological work and the pursuit of the 
communist party's renovation," as well as "more energetic" 
action against corruption, it said. 
  They also discussed steps aimed at speeding up 
share-ownership of public enterprises, agricultural development 
and the state's policy towards rural dwellers, who make up 80 
percent of the population. 
  "It is time for Vietnam to enter a new period of development 
towards industrialisation and modernisation," the delegates 
said, according to the newspaper report. 
  The six-day mini-congress will also see the delegates elect 
about 15 alternate members to the central committee, and replace 
a number of figures who have died, become senile or are in 
disgrace. 
  The party's politburo last week added four members, 
including 
Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam, a general and a vice president 
to national assembly, a move that could herald major changes in 
the political line-up in the next party congress, in 1996.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 24 (YONHAP) -- South Korea asked the 
United States Monday to muster Chinese help in solving North 
Korea's nuclear problem. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu met with visiting Deputy 
Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Tom Hubbard and shared 
concern that North Korea not be allowed to delay much longer in 
inspection negotiations with the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA). He asked that U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher ask China to exert active influence on North Korea 
on the nuclear issue, Chang Chae-yong, director-general of the 
American Affairs Bureau at the Foreign Ministry, said in the 
post-meeting briefing. 
  Christopher and his Chinese counterpart, Qian Qichen, are 
due 
to meet in Paris this week. 
  Hubbard had come to Seoul Sunday after accompanying Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen on an Asian tour. He is the top U.S. 
representative to regular contacts with North Korea in New York. 
  The U.S. official worried at the delay in North Korea-U.S. 
inspection talks and declared there will be no negotiations of 
any sort between North Korea and the United States without the 
Pyongyang-IAEA agreement first. 
  Hubbard called China's role so far as having been 
constructive and promised to seek Beijing's powerful influence 
on North Korea at the Paris meeting of the foreign ministers. 
  Hubbard left for Washington after afternoon talks with South 
Korean Nuclear Ambassador Kim Sam-hun and chief Presidential 
Aide for Diplomacy and National Security Chong Chong-uk.

  [Text] The United States has asked the ROK to open its 
cattle market in addition to its beef market by applying an 
import quota system and to allow local meat-processing firms to 
sell imported beef by processing it as packaged beef. 
  In the two-day livestock negotiations with the ROK in 
Washington on 19 January, the United States demanded that the 
ROK ensure that apart from beef, a minimum volume of cattle, be 
imported each year since the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade [GATT] schedule of concessions provide for zero percent 
tariff for cattle and since the cattle market is to open from 1 
July 1997. The United States also requested that the ROK ease 
its government restrictions prohibiting the local 
meet-processing firms from processing and selling beef imported 
through the simultaneous buying and selling system (SBS) as 
packaged beef. 
  The ROK side, however, is reported to have told the U.S. 
side 
that it is difficult for the ROK to set quotas on live cattle 
and that for the time being, the ROK has to maintain 
restrictions on the sale of packaged meat by meat-processing 
firms that are members of consumer organizations. Participating 
as senior delegates in the Washington negotiation were Yi 
Yong-nae, agricultural attache of the ROK Embassy in the United 
States from the ROK side and Jim Grueff, chief of the Uruguay 
Round [Multilateral Trade Policy Affairs] section of the 
Agricultural Department from the U.S. side.

  [Text] Some scholars and lawmakers yesterday called for 
renegotiation of the Uruguay Round [UR] talks with the United 
States in the agricultural field, mainly in relation to the 
opening of the domestic rice market. 
  In a policy debate over the multilateral UR negotiations 
organized by the opposition Democratic Party [DP], they also 
called on the National Assembly to oppose ratification of the UR 
negotiations and the people to stage a nationwide campaign to 
deter the pressure to import rice. 
  Prof. Kim Wan-pae of Chungang University said, "We should 
not 
submit the documents pledging to carry out the opening of 
agricultural and livestock product markets until late February, 
the deadline set by the GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade]." 
  "We have to appeal to the GATT and ask for more negotiations 
with the United States," he added. 
  He called on the government to ask the GATT to acknowledge 
trade between South and North Korea as an internal exchange 
between the same people. 
  "We need to resume negotiation with the United States 
because 
it is attempting to reject the imports of some agricultural and 
livestock materials to protect its domestic market," he added. 
  He asserted the Assembly special committee on UR 
negotiations 
needs to be operated constantly in a bid to come forward with 
effective measures in this connection. 
  He also called for revolutionary changes in the rural 
structure to ride the expected tough UR wave. 
  Prof. Kim Su-haeng of the Seoul National University said the 
government must reflect the interests of the people in all 
sectors of society in the pursuit of its internationalization. 
  "The government did nothing in connection with the 
improvement of the welfare of the underprivileged, only putting 
emphasis on strengthening the national competitiveness in 
international society," he said. 
  "In a sense, further globalization will result in 
destitution 
of agricultural areas and the increase of jobless people due to 
the rapid change of industrial structure toward autonomization," 
he added. 
  Cho Sung-u from the national emergency committee to protect 
the rice market said, "The UR talks have yet to be finalized. 
It is not true that the opening of the markets for basic 
agricultural products including rice is inevitable." 
  "We have to embark on a national campaign to block rice 
imports by collecting signatures and money to this end," he 
added. 
  Rep. Kim Yong-chin of the DP said, "As an initial step in 
the 
UR talks, we have to call on the U.S. to resume negotiation and 
to clarify our objections to the rice import." 
  Kim called for maintaining the production of rice and other 
basic agricultural products at a proper level to prepare for the 
upcoming national unification era, and other short and long term 
developments.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan. 19 (YONHAP) -- American Evangelist 
Billy Graham will pay his second visit to North Korea later in 
January to help build a church, a diplomatic source said 
Wednesday. 
  "The main purpose of the Rev. Graham's visit is to discuss 
problems related to the construction of a church in the 
Najin-Sonbong area, designated by North Korea as a free economic 
zone, and how to channel Christian funds for it," the source 
said. 
  Graham, who visited North Korea in 1992, is scheduled to 
arrive in Beijing on Jan. 22 and leave the Chinese capital the 
next day aboard a North Korean airliner for Pyongyang, the 
source said. 
  "As he did in 1992, Graham hopes to meet North Korean 
President Kim Il-song and hold a service at Bongsu Church in 
Pyongyang," the source added. 
  Graham conveyed a message from then U.S. President George 
Bush to Kim Il-song and delivered a lecture at Kim Il-song 
University when he visited North Korea between March 31 and 
April 4, 1992, at the invitation of the Council of North Korean 
Christian Churches. 
  Pyongyang has taken a series of positive measures to induce 
church funds into North Korea as part of its efforts to prop up 
its sagging economy. In this connection, there is a fundraising 
campaign among ethnic Koreans in northeastern China to help 
build a church in the Najin-Sonbong zone.

<F P=106> [YONHAP from Berlin] </F>
  [Text] David Kyd, spokesman for the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA], said on 21 January that the IAEA and North 
Korea had agreed to the basic principle of holding limited 
inspections [chehan sachal]. Spokesman Kyd expects North Korea 
will officially give the IAEA a "diplomatic-level" answer, not a 
working-level one, sometime next week. 
  Spokesman Kyd said: "North Korea and the IAEA agreed during 
the third contact on 17 January that future inspections will be 
held to see if there have been any abnormal change 
[pijonsangjogin pyonhwa] in North Korea's nuclear status [haek 
hyonhwang] since the last inspection in 1993 and that it will be 
a one-time only inspection." 
  He stressed: "The IAEA is not demanding overall inspection 
of 
North Korea." He added: "The two sides have agreed to include 
the targets [taesang] being discussed in the current 
working-level contacts in the one-time-only limited inspection 
to ascertain any abnormal change." 
  Regarding the scope and method of inspection to ascertain 
abnormal changes of North Korea's nuclear status, he said the 
IAEA insists on inspecting all items of technical requirements, 
while North Korea insists on limiting the targets considerably 
and reducing the scope. This difference in opinion is 
generating conflict.

  [Text] Berlin, Jan. 22 (YONHAP) -- The International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and North Korea have agreed on the 
basic principle of a one-time restricted inspection, and the 
IAEA is expecting an official answer on the sites Pyongyang will 
open for inspection next week, IAEA Spokesman David Kyd said 
Friday. 
  One-time restricted inspection is neither a regular 
inspection nor a full-fledged inspection, Kyd told YONHAP by 
telephone. The IAEA totally understands the situation and so it 
is not demanding a full scope safeguard inspection. 
  Both sides agree that the purpose of their working-level 
talks is to try to agree on a one-time inspection to see if 
there have been any abnormal changes in the status of North 
Korea's nuclear facilities, but there is a problem on the scope 
of the inspection, Kyd said. 
  The IAEA insists that it should inspect all the facilities, 
and North Korea disagrees. 
  Remarks by a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman 
berating 
the IAEA were just an attempt to shift the blame in case the 
contacts fail to reach an agreement, Kyd said. 
  He said he believed that North Korea would give an official 
answer at a diplomatic level next week, and he is waiting for 
the answer. 
  Making announcements to the outside world and trying to 
reach 
agreement through patient discussions are totally different 
activities, he said, adding that he did not think North Korea 
would break off contact with the IAEA. 
  North Korea may want to say that the IAEA is trying to 
resume 
regular inspections, which had been carried out until last 
year's suspension of nuclear inspection, but that is not true, 
he said. 
  The IAEA has an understanding that the resumption of regular 
inspections should be discussed more. 
  There is no change in the IAEA's position that it will not 
send an inspection team until it has a clear agreement with 
Pyongyang on the scope of the inspection, he added. 
  Also reached by telephone, Yi Si-yong, the South Korean 
ambassador to Vienna, said that there was no change in the 
IAEA's position that North Korea should open all seven declared 
nuclear sites for inspection according to nuclear safeguards 
regulations. 
  Securing continuity of nuclear safeguards in North Korea and 
carrying out a full-fledged inspection are required by 
resolutions of the IAEA Board of Directors and general meeting, 
and the IAEA Secretariat is not in a position to make 
concessions freely, Yi said.

people at home." 
  He also said: "Given North Korea's attitude toward

been intended for domestic consumption." He added that the 
"government will closely monitor the negotiations between North

  [Text] Paris, Jan. 24 (YONHAP) -- Hans Blix, 
secretary-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA), said Sunday that the IAEA will reject a meaningless 
inspection that cannot confirm if North Korea has transferred 
its nuclear materials since the last IAEA inspection in Yongbyon. 
  The North Korean nuclear problem is not only the most 
sensitive issue related to Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 
(NPT) but the most delicate issue politically also, the French 
daily LIBERATION quoted him as saying. If IAEA inspection is 
always blocked, like in North Korea, the problem is very 
serious, he said. 
  North Korea allowed the IAEA to inspect its seven declared 
nuclear facilities in January last year for the last time before 
it announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty in March. 
  The IAEA is demanding from North Korea the same inspections 
of its seven declared nuclear facilities as conducted last year, 
and is discussing inspection of two additional nuclear 
facilities. 
  The IAEA is also demanding periodic inspections, Blix said. 
  It is certain that North Korea did not declare some 
plutonium 
although it declared that nuclear facilities in Yongbyon 
produced a minimal amount of plutonium, he said. 
  Inspections of the two undeclared nuclear facilities are to 
confirm if they produced plutonium, but the IAEA is still not 
sure if it can find how much plutonium was produced from the 
North Korean nuclear sites. 
  On the question of whether the IAEA can guarantee that North 
Korea is not pushing ahead with military nuclear programs after 
the inspection conditions are met, he said that there are always 
uncertainties. 
  Even if the IAEA does inspect the nuclear reactors in 
Yongbyon, it cannot rule out the existence of secret nuclear 
facilities, he said. He said that the monitoring equipment in 
North Korean nuclear facilities has not been operating for 
several months because film and batteries ran out and did not 
rule out the possibility that North Korea extracted nuclear 
material from the reactors. 
  North Korea has not allowed the IAEA inspection team to 
exchange films and batteries of the monitoring equipment since 
last August.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan 22 (YONHAP) -- North Korea agreed, in 
principle, to open its seven declared nuclear sites to full 
international inspections in a meeting with the United States 
late last year, but negotiations between North Korea and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on these inspections 
appear not to be proceeding as smoothly as was generally 
expected. 
  In these negotiations, now under way between working-level 
officials in Vienna, North Korea is seeking to impose 
unacceptable limits on IAEA inspections of the nuclear sites in 
the face of the IAEA's formal request for full inspections in 
line with IAEA standards. 
  Among the seven sites are a radiochemical laboratory and a 
5-megawatt reactor, and the IAEA wants to conduct full 
inspections of these facilities under its nuclear safeguards 
regime. 
  But North Korea has reportedly agreed to permit inspections 
of the seven facilities within the limits of ensuring the 
continuity of nuclear safeguards only, as it has suspended its 
decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
(NPT). North Korea's reasoning is that it has no obligation to 
meet full NPT requirements for inspections. 
  North Korea wants to limit IAEA inspections to replacement 
of 
films and batteries of cameras set in the seven facilities, 
while denying IAEA inspectors access to fuel rods of the 
five-megawatt reactor and substances used by the radiochemical 
laboratory though the IAEA judges such access necessary for a 
meaningful inspection. 
  This position of North Korea was manifested in an interview 
by an unidentified spokesman of the North Korean Foreign 
Ministry right after an agreement reached between North Korea 
and the United States on full inspections of North Korea's seven 
declared nuclear sites in New York late last year. 
  The spokesman said in the interview with Pyongyang's 
official 
Korean Central News Agency on Dec. 30, just a day after a 
working-level meeting between North Korea and the United States 
in New York where the agreement was reached, that the United 
States had agreed to suspend the "Team Spirit" military exercise 
with South Korea and North Korea had agreed to permit 
international inspections of the declared nuclear sites not in 
line with the nuclear safeguards treaty but in line with the 
need to ensure the continuity of nuclear safeguards. 
  When the agreement was put into effect, he said, the two 
countries would hold a third round of high-level talks to 
discuss an end to Washington's hostile policy toward Pyongyang, 
including a nuclear threat, for improved Pyongyang-Washington 
relations and resumption of regular IAEA inspections of North 
Korea's nuclear facilities for a complete settlement of the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  Commenting on the working-level North Korea-U.S. meeting in 
New York on Dec. 3, the same spokesman said in a statement that 
North Korea had offered a plan to expand the scope of 
inspections to the extent of ensuring the continuity of nuclear 
safeguards, adding that this offer was a maximum concession. 
  This suggests that North Korea has no plan to permit full 
IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities until relations with 
the United States are improved. 
  It just wants to allow IAEA inspections of its declared 
nuclear sites within the limit of ensuring the continuity of 
safeguards until a third round of the high-level talks with the 
United States is held to discuss resumption of regular IAEA 
inspections and improved relations between Pyongyang and 
Washington for a complete solution of the nuclear issue. 
  Despite the on-going negotiations with the IAEA, North Korea 
is insisting on resumption of the talks with the United States, 
saying direct talks with Washington are a shortcut for solution 
of the nuclear issue. It appears to be paying little attention 
to the IAEA. 
  A commentary in the Jan. 19 issue of the Workers' 
(Communist) Party organ, the NODONG SINMUN, reiterated that the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must solved through direct 
talks between North Korea and the United States, calling for 
immediate holding of a third round of the high-level talks with 
the United States. 
  "If the two sides hold a third round of the talks to discuss 
a package deal with a sincere and fair attitude to the dialogue, 
as agreed on in the Dec. 29 meeting in New York, the (nuclear) 
problem will be completely solved," it said.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 24 (YONHAP) -- A South Korean nuclear 
scientist was recently appointed to the Standing Advisory Group 
on Safeguards and Implementation (SAGSI) of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Foreign Ministry said Monday. 
  Hans Blix, director-general of the IAEA, announced the 
appointment of Dr. Kim Pyong-ku, 50, vice president of the Korea 
Atomic Energy Research Institute [KAERI], Foreign Ministry 
officials said. 
  The SAGSI, consisting of 14 regular members, is an 
influential advisory group to the IAEA director for the 
formation of policy and execution of policy and projects aimed 
at preventing proliferation of nuclear arms and promotion of the 
peaceful use of nuclear energy. 
  Kim, the first Korean to be appointed a SAGSI member, is a 
graduate of Seoul National University and California Institute 
of Technology. He worked as a regular researcher at the jet 
propulsion laboratory in the United States between 1972 and 1975 
before returning home to work for the KAERI in May 1975.

  [Text] According to a Chinese source on 21 January, North 
Korea has been secretly extracting a considerable amount of 
plutonium while it held nuclear negotiations with the United 
States, and that it is highly possible that North Korea has 
already produced a small nuclear bomb and is hiding it in an 
underground warehouse. This source well-versed in North Korean 
affairs said: "I recently heard from a senior North Korean 
official that North Korea is hiding nuclear weapons in an 
underground warehouse in the mountains near Pyongyang and that 
any thorough inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities [haek 
sisol] by the United States and the International Atomic Energy 
Agency will fail to locate them."

<F P=106> [By Korea Herald correspondent Min Pyong-il] </F>
  [Text] MACAO -- Macao circles are looking forward to 
expansion of North Korean activities in the Portuguese enclave 
in the remaining five years before China regains sovereignty 
over Macao in 1999, a North Korean watcher here said. 
  Chokwang Trading Co. originally operated, paying what 
amounted to only token rental charges, from one of the 
properties of the late Ho Yin, perhaps the richest and most 
influential pro-Beijing Chinese businessman in Macao, he 
explained. 
  Following Ho Yin's death close to 10 years back, some of the 
properties are being redeveloped and Chokwang will soon move to 
a property that it had acquired in recent years, according to 
business sources here. 
  "It is almost certain that the North Korean will continue to 
use Chokwang as a bridge to the Western world after 1999," the 
North Korean watcher said. 
  For years, there have been reports that Chokwang had been 
active as the purchasing or selling agent for North Korea. Back 
in the early 1970s, North Korea had requested to set up a shop 
which was intended to act as an intelligence gathering agency in 
Hong Kong, but the Hong Kong Government declined, he explained. 
  North Koreans were undaunted and set up a shop in a Chinese 
name with personnel traveling either as Hong Kong citizens or 
Chinese holding Chinese passports. 
  After their attempts in Hong Kong were thwarted, North Korea 
finally set up a shop selling North Korean bric-a-brac on one of 
the main roads in northern Macao, the source disclosed. 
  Later it was expanded and while the shop still functioned, 
more North Koreans came and set up the Chokwang Trading on Ho 
Yin's property, according to the watcher. 
  According to him, it had been a common joke that one of the 
paramount duties of Chokwang was to buy luxury goods for the Kim 
father and son, the son being particularly prone to a special 
brand of Swiss chocolate. 
  North Korean watchers first sensed Kim Chong-il's absence 
from public scene in the mid-1970s, when those involved in 
monitoring chocolate shipments from Switzerland to North Korea 
noticed that the shipments had suddenly ceased. 
  At one time, the business activities of Chokwang were so 
robust that its staff multiplied -- from a mere 11 or 12 in 1975 
to more than 100. After the series of terrorist accidents such 
as KAL bombing and Rangoon assassination attempt, not to mention 
the kidnapping of a popular Korean actress Choe Un-hui in Hong 
Kong, the Macao authorities, using a newly promulgated law on 
residency of aliens as a stick, restricted North Koreans' 
presence here, according to him. 
  Mario Soares, the Portuguese president, visited Korea in 
October last year and openly blasted North Korea while visiting 
the truce village of Panmunjom. Before he flew into Seoul as 
the first Portuguese president to have ever visited Korea, he 
spent two days in Macao as part of his itinerary, which 
culminated in a ceremony in Tokyo to mark the 450th anniversary 
of Portuguese arrival in Japan. 
  North Korean watchers here said that Soares' outburst at 
Pyongyang would not materially affect Chokwang's activities in 
Macao. 
  Nevertheless, the Portuguese security agency appears to be 
doubling its watch for any intelligence or subversive activities 
by the North Koreans. 
  "As far as I know, not only is it closely watching Chokwang 
but also keeping surveillance on all North Korean residents 
here," he said. 
  Today, according to other sources, Chokwang has a permanent 
staff of about 30. However, this does not necessarily mean its 
activities have been curtailed, a North Korean watcher stressed. 
  It means only some annoying inconvenience for them as the 
North Koreans who arrive in Macao for a day or two's visit now 
have to go to the nearby Zhuhai Special Economic Zone only to 
return the next day to continue their business, he concluded.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 17 (YONHAP) -- Opposition leader Yi 
Ki-taek said Monday he will negotiate with the government on 
visiting North Korea after the National Assembly session ends 
next month. 
  He told reporters at his home early in the morning that he 
had been considering a North Korea visit "from quite long ago." 
  Aware of the criticism that he is acting on a whim, the 
opposition leader said he had been discussing inter-Korean 
relations with experts. 
  "I sought the opinions of others whom I met at last year-end 
gatherings and they had rather progressive views about even the 
nuclear problem," Yi said. 
  Asked whether arrangements for the visit are well in 
advance, 
he said they "have just begun." 
  "I expressed my intent to go to North Korea as an opposition 
leader, and I am preparing and collecting necessary materials," 
Yi said. 
  He will begin consultations with the government about the 
visit after the extraordinary assembly session in January and 
February, and has specifically ordered his spokesman to announce 
that he will not, under any circumstances, neglect domestic 
issues such as water contamination and the Uruguay Round, Yi 
said. 
  As he was doing it for improvement of inter-Korean ties, 
there was "no reason" for the government to refuse him 
permission to make the trip, Yi said. 
  The opposition leader embarks on a visit to China later this 
month that was originally planned for last November or December. 
  Meetings with Chinese leaders were set then, but 
rescheduling 
is not going well, he said.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 17 (YONHAP) -- Yi Ki-taek, chairman of 
the major opposition Democratic Party, has said that he will 
formally apply in February for a government permit to visit 
North Korea. 
  Yi, exchanging New Year's greetings with Stephen Cardinal 
Kim 
Su- hwan at Myongdong Cathedral, said Monday [17 January] he 
will propose an inter-Korean summit and a tripartite meeting of 
Pyongyang, Washington and Seoul if he meets with North Korean 
President Kim Il-song. 
  Frequent inter-Korean exchanges, including cultural 
exchanges 
and economic cooperation, will help resolve inter-Korean 
problems and achieve national reunification, he told the Roman 
Catholic primate of South Korea. 
  "My reason for visiting North Korea is that we remain in the 
cold-war framework of reasoning, though we are living in the 
post- cold war era," Yi said. 
  "The political approach to the reunification issue so far 
should now be shifted to an economic approach, and I believe the 
opposition party has a role to play in creating an environment 
for such a shift and in arranging inter-Korean talks for 
solution of the nuclear issue." 
  The cardinal said visiting North Korea is not always as 
simple as Yi made out because North Korea may try to make use of 
such a visit for its own political objectives.

  [Text] If North Korea allows the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] to inspect seven reported nuclear 
facilities and agrees to hold the exchange of special envoys of 
the South and North, the government will allow businessmen to 
visit North Korea. 
  A government official revealed on 18 January: "If North 
Korea allows the IAEA inspection team to visit North Korea to 
receive practical [silchilchokin] inspection of the seven 
reported facilities and agrees to the exchange of special envoys 
of the South and North, this will be recognized as a 
breakthrough in resolving the nuclear issue, thus making it 
possible to allow businessmen to visit North Korea." 
  This greatly eases the government's policy that was decided 
upon at the August reunification-related ministers meeting in 
which it decided that `businessmen will be allowed to visit 
North Korea only when North Korea completely returns to the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and agrees to the inspection of 
unreported facilities in Yongbyon.' 
  If a breakthrough is made on the nuclear issue, the 
government plans to allow technicians to visit North Korea to 
activate the consignment processing trade [imgagong kyoyok]. 
  A government official said: "The volume of South-North trade 
was reduced by six percent last year because of the nuclear 
issue. However, processing trade for reexport [witak kagong] 
increased by seven to eight times, thus showing the possibility 
of South-North trade. Necessary measures will be taken at the 
government level this year to actively assist such processing." 
  If North Korea accepts the IAEA's inspection and also the 
South-North mutual inspection, the government will actively work 
on opening direct South-North sea route which is being pointed 
out as the greatest obstacle in South-North trade. The 
government will also establish a South-North exchange 
cooperative subcommittee to provide measures for guaranteeing 
investment, preventing double taxation, and providing procedures 
for disputes. 
  It was learned that the sea routes between Inchon Port-Nampo 
Port, Pusan Port-Wonsan Port, and Pohang Port-Chongjin Port will 
be the most likely sea routes already agreed upon between South 
and North Korea in case a direct sea route is established. 
  The government plans to make a final decision over this 
matter at the 25 January reunification-related ministers meeting.

said: "No one can restrain my will to visit North Korea." He 
thus drove a wedge in the criticism being made by the people

possibility that his visit to the North may be used by North 
Korea, he said: "From my political statesmanship point of view, 
I firmly believe that by no means will I be embroiled in North 
Korea's reunification front strategy. I believe that anyone, 
including government officials, can work to dissolve the current 
stalemate existing between the South and North." Executive 
Chairman Yi, who has been trying to visit China, postponed his 
visit because no substantial results were achieved by his 
special envoy who visited China recently.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 17 (YONHAP) -- The government has 
decided to promote Visit Korea Year `94 with programs combining 
major sightseeing interests in South and North Korea, provided 
that the nuclear problem is solved, sources at the National 
Unification Board [NUB] said Monday. 
  "This year is Visit Korea Year and we are thinking of 
providing package tours enabling overseas Korean residents and 
foreigners to visit South and North Korea at one time," a source 
said. "North Korea has showed positive attitudes to attract 
foreigners since the 1980s to earn foreign currency, so the plan 
is very likely to be realized." 
  The Korea National Tourism Corp. and travel agents will be 
allowed to contact North Korean officials to discuss developing 
travel packages or joint advertising to attract foreigners as 
soon as a breakthrough is made in talks over the North Korean 
nuclear problem, the source said. 
  Such details as crossing points for tourists on the border 
and procedures for cross-border travel could be discussed by 
government officials if Seoul and Pyongyang resume dialogue, he 
said. 
  "Considering the particular situation facing the North, the 
package tours will be limited to foreigners and overseas 
Koreans, " he said. 
  The board wants to make Mt. Sorak, Mt. Kumkang and Panmunjom 
free tourist zones to attract foreigners, he said. 
  It will probably brief South Korean President Kim Yong-sam 
on 
its plan on Thursday, the source said.

  [Text] Government officials, military officers and 
civilians met yesterday at the central committee meeting of the 
Counter-Infiltration Operations Center (CIOC) over a total 
defense posture to better cope with unconventional warfare (UW) 
likely to be staged by North Korea. 
  Gen. Yi Yang-ho, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff [JCS] 
and CIOC commander, presided over the meeting held at the first 
conference room of the Defense Ministry. 
  The CIOC designated establishment of the nation's total 
security preparedness as its key target in 1994. 
  The participants discussed a broad range of measures to 
build 
up the readiness to instantly counter an irregular warfare, 
complete a joint civilian-government-military defense capability 
and conduct training exercises for guerrilla warfare, reviewing 
North Korea's capability of provoking unconventional warfare and 
its possibility. 
  In a report, a senior CIOC officer said that North Korea 
completed a "three-stage" preparedness for waging a war from 
Oct. 8, 1992 through July 27, 1993 and that it regimented its 
people and the military forces more tightly in its uphill 
efforts to strengthen and maintain Kim Il-song's ideological 
system, chuche or self-reliance. 
  North Korea has secured a 100,000-strong commando force, the 
largest in the world, and about 2,000 special operatives, the 
officer reported, revealing that it has recently concentrated on 
construction of midget submarines and air-cushioned hovercrafts 
for "high-intensity" infiltrations. 
  The North Korean military machine, according to the officer, 
is also capable of sending roughly 20,000 combat troops 
simultaneously into action by mobilizing AN-2 planes, cargo 
aircraft and surface vessels. 
  He predicted that the types of provocations by North Korean 
infiltrators would range from attempts to set up a underground 
party in the South by using core agents and infiltration to the 
rear areas through the demilitarized zone (DMZ) to conduct 
political, ideological and psychological warfare and camouflaged 
peace offensive. 
  In an address, Gen. Yi warned strongly against relaxation in 
a sense of security and absent-minded posture, emphasizing the 
sense of security in which part of the people regard a 
possibility of military provocation by North Korea only as 
groundless fear is a real threat and danger from within to the 
national defense posture. 
  North Korea, the only Stalinist communist country in the 
post-Cold War world, continues propagations and instigations to 
both its people and military forces, for complete preparations 
for a war with the South, Yi added. 
  At a ceremony in the wake of the hour-long meeting, the JCS 
chairman conferred the presidential citations upon the Army's 
Chungyong Unit, the Kyongsangpuk-to Civil Defense Consultation 
Committee, the Kangwon-to regional police administration and the 
Hyundai Precision &amp; Industry Co.s factory in the Changwon 
Industrial complex for their contributions toward consolidation 
of the counter-espionage system.

  [Text] Moscow has notified Seoul that it has made 
contracts to sell 12 decommissioned submarines to Pyongyang and 
already handed over one to the country under the contract, the 
Foreign Ministry said yesterday. 
  Russian Vice Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov met South 
Korean diplomats in Moscow Thursday and told them the vessels 
cannot be restored to submarines as they have been completely 
removed of arms and other equipment. 
  He also said Russia has obliged North Korea to allow 
Russians 
to check, for verification, the disassembling process in the 
contract, the ministry said. 
  "From these reports from Russia, the decommissioned 
submarines being sold to North Korea are believed to be for use 
as scrap metal," said Paek Nak-hwan, director-general for 
European Affairs. 
  When asked by Seoul of its evaluation, Washington also said 
it saw little possibility that North Korea would acquire 
submarine technologies through disassembling the vessels, Paek 
said. 
  U.S. officials said that North Korea might use some of the 
disassembled parts for its other submarines but this also might 
not pose much worries, he said. 
  Paek said the former Soviet Union had handed over two 
decommissioned submarines to South Korea's Samsung in 1989 in 
exchange for some medical equipment. 
  Samsung conducted a close examination but didn't find any 
other use of the vessels but as scrap iron at that time, he said. 
  The former Soviet Union also sold two vessels to Taiwan in 
1991 but China did not raise objections, Paek said. 
  The official said Seoul has demanded an additional 
explanation from Moscow on how it will check the process of 
disjoining the vessels. 
  "We will continue to closely watch future development of the 
Russia-North Korea dealing," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 21 (YONHAP) -- A joint South Korean, 
Japanese and Russian investigation into possible contamination 
of the East Sea by Russian dumping of nuclear waste is to be 
carried out in late February, informed sources said Thursday. 
  The three countries had planned to hold the investigation in 
mid- January, but had to postpone the plan because of 
differences of opinion over cost sharing, they said. The 
problems were resolved recently. 
  The area for investigation will be the East Sea off 
Hokkaido, 
where the Russian Far-East fleet said it dumped nuclear waste in 
October last year.

  [Text] Pusan, Jan. 19 (YONHAP) -- A Russian maritime 
research vessel was being held here since Sunday for its failure 
to pay the cost of a repair it underwent at a Pusan shipyard 
last year. The 493-ton vessel, "Igor Maksimov," entered the 
Pusan harbor on last Friday carrying 22 Korean-Russian tourists. 
The ship was originally scheduled to leave Pusan Sunday 
afternoon. But, the Korean agency of a Russian state firm to 
which the vessel belongs had the Pusan court distrain the ship 
pending the payment of a repair fee. An official of the Korean 
agency said on Wednesday "Igor Maksimov" was repaired for one 
month last August at Choyang Shipyard at Yong-to, Pusan. But, 
the Russian firm failed to pay the repair fee totaling about 35 
million won. The vessel has a crew of 23 in addition to the 
ethnic Korean passengers.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 20 (YONHAP) -- Lin Tsung-hsien, chief of 
the Taiwanese mission in Seoul, flew into Seoul on Thursday 
afternoon to assume his new duty. 
  "I will do all I can to restore the suspended bilateral 
relations at an early date and promote new relationship based on 
the principles of reciprocity and equality," Lin said on arrival 
at Kimpo Airport. 
  He said closer cooperation between the two countries will 
serve mutual interests and also contribute to stability and 
prosperity in Asia. 
  South Korea and Taiwan severed formal diplomatic ties in 
August 1992 when Seoul entered ambassadorial relations with 
mainland China. 
  Late last year, the two countries agreed to exchange 
semiofficial resident missions. Seoul opened its mission in 
Taipei on last Nov. 25.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 21 (YONHAP) -- Tourist exchanges with 
Taiwan are expected to regain vigor along with the inauguration 
of a Taiwanese mission in Seoul Monday, the Korea National 
Tourism Corp. (KNTC) and tourism sources said Friday. 
  Tourism will soon recover to the level of 1992, when Seoul 
and Taipei severed ties because of Seoul's normalization of ties 
with Beijing, they said. 
  The opening of the Taiwanese mission means that Taipei wants 
to increase personnel and material exchanges, they said, so 
Taiwanese travel agents are likely to start selling package 
tours to Seoul. 
  Last year, 147,000 Taiwanese nationals visited South Korea, 
or nearly half of the 296,000 recorded in 1992, and 85,000 
Koreans visited Taiwan, compared with 126,000. 
  With severance of ties, the national carriers of both 
countries cut flights between Seoul and Taipei on Sept. 15, 1992. 
  Korean Air and Asiana Airlines of Korea, and China Airlines 
and Eva Airlines of Taiwan are negotiating for resumption of 
flights. 
  Before severance of ties, Korean Air had 16 flights a week 
between Seoul and Taipei; Asiana, four; China Airlines, nine; 
and Eva, six. 
  Cathay Pacific Airlines, Northwest Airlines, Thai 
international Airways, Singapore Airlines and Delta Airlines 
currently have 34 direct flights a week between Seoul and Taipei. 
  Some travel agents that specialize in Taiwanese tourists 
have 
sales promotions. Taiwanese like to visit Korea in the winter 
for the snow-covered mountains and skiing, which are unavailable 
in Taiwan.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 17 (YONHAP) -- The Bank of China, a 
state- run bank that specializes in foreign exchange services, 
will open a branch in Seoul on Wednesday [19 Jan], becoming the 
first Chinese financial institution to operate in South Korea. 
  The branch will be promoted from a representative office, 
set 
up in August 1992, under the Korea-China financial agreement 
that was concluded last year. The Korea Exchange Bank already 
opened a branch in Tianjin in late December. 
  Capitalized at 12 billion won (about 15 million U.S. 
dollars), the bank of China's Seoul branch is expected to focus 
its banking services on companies dealing with China. 
  It will also provide counseling services to businesses 
planning to invest in China. 
  Capitalized at 5.2 billion dollars, the Bank of China has 
6,183 branches in China and 448 overseas. 
  Two other Chinese banks -- the Industrial and Commercial 
Bank 
of China and the People's Construction Bank of China -- now 
maintain a representative office each in Seoul.

  Yi sent an aide to Beijing on Jan. 7 to arrange meetings 
with 
President Jiang Zemin and other Chinese leaders, but the aide 
failed to get a schedule fixed, according to the official. 
  "I've heard that Yi's aide returned home on Monday and 
explained the results of his trip to Beijing to Yi," the 
official said. "The aide pushed for meetings between five 
Chinese leaders and Yi, but he could not fix a schedule."

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 21 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and China are 
expected to sign an aviation agreement on direct services when 
President Kim Yong-sam visits Beijing in March, officials said 
Friday. 
  Working-level negotiations in the Chinese capital have been 
extended and are progressing in a "positive direction," one said. 
  Korea will succeed in having the Seoul-Beijing flight 
control 
transfer point set at 124 degrees longitude as designated by the 
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). 
  China had been opposed, saying the line was drawn when 
Taiwan 
represented China at the ICAO. 
  But the two sides are to skirt the transfer point issue on 
the Seoul-Shanghai route and fly along a corridor, as done up to 
now, the official said. 
  Kim is expected to visit Beijing in March and the two 
countries likely will formally sign the aviation agreement then, 
he said. 
  The agreement will be initialed at the next aviation talks 
in 
Beijing.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 17 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam on 
Monday [17 January] afternoon met visiting Spanish Foreign 
Minister Javier Solana at Chongwadae [presidential office]. 
  During the meeting, President Kim conferred the Order of 
Diplomatic Service Merit, Kwanghwa Medal, on the Spanish 
minister before exchanging opinions on ways to further promote 
bilateral cooperation. 
  The president especially thanked Minister Solana for the 
support his country, as a non-permanent member country of the 
U.N. Security Council, extended to South Korea over the North 
Korean nuclear issues. 
  Meanwhile, at a press conference Minister Solana said the 
North Korean nuclear issues should be resolved in a rightful 
direction in the interests of world security. 
  Solana said it is desirable that the nuclear question will 
be 
settled before the need arises for the U.N. Security Council to 
take a sanction. 
  Also saying that there is a growing need of cooperation 
between Korea and Spain in the areas of international politics 
and economy, Minister Solana expressed the hope that his visit 
would contribute much to expanding friendly cooperative ties 
between the two countries. 
  The Spanish minister flew into Seoul on Sunday [16 January] 
for a three-day official visit. He was the first Spanish 
foreign minister ever to visit Seoul since the two countries 
entered ambassadorial relations in 1950.

  [Text] Concern over the possible production and use of 
nuclear weapons by South Korea and the division of the peninsula 
were the main topics of conversation between Spanish Foreign 
Minister Javier Solana and members of the South Korean 
Government as they met today, the second day of his visit to 
this Asian country. Javier Solana, who met the South Korean 
deputy prime minister and the minister of defense, said that the 
risk of nuclear proliferation is something that has to be 
avoided by us all. 
  [Correspondent] Solana also spoke to the defense minister 
about the sale of 12 cargo planes built by the Compania de 
Construcciones Aeronauticas Espanolas, CASA, planes that are now 
being delivered. He also discussed the possibility of another 
order. Now that his visit to South Korea is over, the minister 
will continue his Far Eastern tour in Malaysia and Thailand. 
The tour started last Friday in Japan.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 18 (YONHAP) -- The duty and camp site 
of the South Korean engineer unit serving in Somalia as part of 
the U.N. Peace Keeping Forces [PKO], may be changed shortly, a 
Foreign Ministry official said on Tuesday. 
  The official said the likely refixing has been necessitated 
as the function of the U.N. PKO forces there has been reduced 
to relief programs only and major Western countries' troops are 
set to pull out of the African country shortly. 
  "In particular, we are discussing with the U.N. Secretariat 
and relevant countries on matters related to the security of the 
Korean PKO unit since the Italian contingent which has been 
supporting the Korean unit in terms of security is to return to 
Italy by the end of March," he said. 
  The official added that despite the planned early withdrawal 
of the troops of major Western countries, there is no plan so 
far to bring the Korean unit home ahead of schedule. 
  The Korean engineer unit is supposed to remain in Somalia 
through July this year.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 21 (YONHAP) -- The Trade, Industry and 
Energy Ministry added Brunei to the list of countries from which 
it imports natural gas Friday. 
  It did this to secure a stable supply of gas, demand for 
which has recently soared for home use and power stations, a 
ministry spokesman said. 
  Korea previously imported natural gas from only Indonesia, 
Malaysia and Australia. 
  The ministry will import 56,000 tons of natural gas from 
Brunei next month and make a long-term contract with the country 
to buy 600,000 tons to 1 million tons a year after 1995, he said. 
  Brunei charges 169 U.S. dollars a ton for its gas, compared 
with 172 dollars for Malaysia and 206 dollars for Indonesia. 
  The ministry is to increase imports of natural gas 20.7 
percent from 4,453,000 tons last year to 5,376,000 tons this 
year. 
  Korea's demand for natural gas is expected to increase about 
22 percent over 1993 to 5.32 million tons this year.

  [Text] Seoul will provide grants worth 31.8 billion won 
(some $40 million) to developing nations this year, up 20 
percent from the 26.5 billion won last year, the Foreign 
Ministry said yesterday. 
  The increase reflects the government's will to actively 
promote economic cooperation with other countries as part of 
efforts for Korea's internationalization, it said. 
  The money will be mainly used in helping solve global 
problems such as poverty and environmental pollution, 
strengthening cooperation with Asian-Pacific countries and 
supporting the efforts of former socialist countries to shift to 
free market system, the ministry said. 
  The Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), an 
affiliate of the ministry, is in charge of implementing various 
programs of cooperation. It was inaugurated in April 1991. 
  To be specific, the agency will invite 858 trainees from 101 
developing nations this year as well as sending 97 experts to 56 
nations to share the experience in economic development, it said. 
  It will also dispatch 76 volunteer workers to 11 countries, 
including Indonesia and Mongolia, and send 18 medical doctors to 
17 nations, most of them in Africa. 
  The agency will spend $13.7 million in project-type programs 
and emergency aid for natural disasters to 98 countries and four 
international organizations, $3.26 million in building 
vocational training centers in Indonesia and Sudan and $4.46 
million in 17 development research programs in eight Asian 
nations.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 18 (YONHAP) -- Former Prime Minister 
Chong Il-kwon died of lymph cancer at a hospital in Hawaii late 
Monday [17 January] (Tuesday morning in Korea). He was 77. 
  Since he stepped down as president of the Korea Freedom 
League in April 1991, Chong had been undergoing cancer therapy 
in Washington and Hawaii. 
  He was hospitalized late last year when his illness got 
worse. 
  A graduate of the Japanese Military Academy, Chong was 
general commander during the Korean war (1950-53) and served as 
ambassador to Washington, foreign minister, prime minister 
(1964-1970), a two- term parliamentarian, and house speaker. 
  He is survived by his 47-year-old wife, Pak Hye-su, and two 
children. 
  His body is due to arrive in Seoul around Wednesday.

<F P=106> [Report by Kim Myong-chol] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 18 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
had received reports on their 1994 operating programs from 11 of 
his government's 27 ministries and agencies as of Tuesday, and 
all 11 are economic ministries. 
  Kim asked his ministers with economic portfolios to report 
first as the focus of his policy in 1994 is revitalizing the 
economy through increased international competitiveness of 
Korean products, and he wanted to hear about the plans to 
achieve this goal before anything else, according to Chongwadae 
[presidential office] officials. 
  He also wanted to relieve the economic ministries of the 
burden of new year presidential reports as soon as possible so 
that they can quickly start work preparing for 
internationalization and market opening. 
  Kim questioned working-level officials, as well as 
ministers, 
to see if they knew their jobs in a phenomenon unseen in new 
year presidential briefings in the past, where the president 
heard the report and then issued instructions without any give 
and take. [sentence as received] 
  Pollution of the Naktong River interfered with the 11 
economic briefings and left the administration dumbfounded. 
  Kim was frustrated in his desire to finish receiving new 
year 
reports from all government ministries and agencies by the end 
of January as he had to divert much attention to the issue. 
  He told the cabinet to look into the cause of the pollution 
and work out a comprehensive plan to keep all rivers, especially 
those that supply tap water, free of pollution. 
  "The issue has resulted from the failure of past governments 
to take proper anti-pollution measures for the five biggest 
rivers, including the Naktong," he said. "The present civilian 
government must not gloss over the issue but seek a fundamental 
solution of it to win the people's trust." 
  Receiving the reports, Kim stressed five points -- measures 
against financial market opening, privatization of state-run 
enterprises, industrial peace, rural development, and 
deregulation of economic activities for increased exports. 
  To cope with the liberalization of financial services, he 
said, the functions of supervisory institutions such as the 
Office of Bank Supervision, the Securities Supervisory Board and 
the Insurance Supervisory Board should be reformed to help 
financial institutions increase their competitiveness against 
foreign rivals. 
  On the privatization program, Kim said state-run enterprises 
that can be better operated by private hands, including 
state-run telecommunications firms, should be privatized for 
better market competitiveness. 
  But he stressed most the need for labor-management 
cooperation and industrial peace. In the Labor Ministry's 
briefing Jan. 13, he pointed to the need for labor and 
management to recognize that they are in the same boat in this 
era of boundless international competition and said: "The defeat 
in this competition means not only the end of the business for 
management but also the loss of livelihood for labor." 
  Kim appears to have a firm belief that annual labor disputes 
serve only to hinder the effort to revitalize the economy. 
  With the Trade, Industry and Energy, and Agriculture, 
Forestry and Fisheries Ministries he stressed the need for 
measures to help corporations increase capital investment, to 
ease foreign trade rules for increased exports and to develop 
agriculture as a competitive and viable industry. 
  It is but midway through the briefings, however, and thus 
too 
soon to evaluate the course as a whole. 
  Distinct differences from the past are evident though. While 
Kim is using the sessions as an opportunity for dialogue with 
working-level officials on policy, the officials are using them 
to express their opinions on the pressing issues facing the 
country.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 18 (YONHAP) -- Chongwadae [presidential 
office] has decided to reduce the frequency of the president's 
exclusive interviews with individual press medias on their 
anniversaries. 
  Presidential Press Secretary Chu Ton-sik said on Tuesday 
that 
instead of allowing a presidential interview on every 
anniversary of national and local press medias as now, the 
president will grant an exclusive interview with a media only 
once in three years. 
  "In the past, President Kim Yong-sam gave all anniversary 
interviews requested, which means the president had to give 
about 40 exclusive interviews a year," said Chu, adding that 
when those given to the Chongwadae press corps are taken into 
account, the number rises to about 50. 
  The reduced interviews will not affect President Kim's 
monthly meetings with the Chongwadae press corps, Chu said.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 17 (YONHAP) -- The government has 
decided to operate this year's money supply tightly to an extent 
that does not pose an extra burden to industries. 
  Finance Minister Hong Chae-hyong said on Monday the money 
supply expansion ceiling has been set at 14 to 17 percent for 
this year. "Unlike past practices, however, we will operate 
money supply a little tightly without regard to the ceiling," 
Hong said. 
  In a policy consultation with senior Bank of Korea 
officials, 
the finance minister said, "Money supply should be operated in 
consideration of the trend of money interests in view of 
industries' financial burden." 
  Touching on the ceiling of foreigners' investment in stocks, 
Minister Hong said the government plans, if possible, to reduce 
the influx of foreign money into the stock market this year. 
  "We must develop mid- and long-term policy devices over this 
issue in consideration of our country's entry into the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 
next year," the minister said. 
  He thus implied that his Ministry would expand the ceiling 
of 
foreigners' investment in stocks by next year at the latest as 
planned. 
  "To open the stock market without developing devices for the 
management of money supply is like pushing a brakeless car down 
from the top of a hill," Hong said. "Yet, a winter comes anyway 
even though you didn't prepare a coat."

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 14 (YONHAP) -- The government will 
strictly enforce the "no work, no wage" principle in future 
labor disputes, Labor Affairs Minister Nam Chae-hui said on 
Friday. 
  The principle calls for no remunerations for workers when 
they do not work during the period of labor disputes. 
  Minister Nam said another principle his ministry will uphold 
will be the policy that "essential matters related to rights to 
personnel and management cannot be subject to labor disputes." 
  In an exclusive interview with the YONHAP news agency, Nam 
said his ministry will abide by these principles if only to 
dispel confusion in labor-management negotiations this year. 
  "No work, no wage" policy is a general principle that has 
been broadly recognized around the world, he said. 
  As for disputes over personnel and management rights, the 
labor minister said that though the labor rights are guaranteed 
under the Constitution, they cannot infringe on the essential 
elements of other basic rights. 
  "Since the right to management is based on the right to 
properties guaranteed under the basic law, labor disputes aimed 
at interfering in management cannot be justified," Nam said. 
  He added, however, that in case matters falling under the 
realm of personnel or management rights have a serious effect 
directly on working conditions or the standing of workers, 
disputes could be justified only to such an extent.

  [Text] Pohang, South Korea, Jan. 19 (YONHAP) -- Pohang 
Iron and Steel Co. Ltd. (POSCO) workers will get a 2.9-percent 
pay hike this month under an agreement thrashed out by the 
company's industrial council. 
  The modest increase in basic pay and fixed allowances was 
set 
by the council, which comprises 18 labor representatives and 12 
management negotiators, in a bid to maintain POSCO's 
international competitiveness, according to a company spokesman. 
  "The industrial council agreed that the pay raise should be 
low for the company to survive the rapidly changing 
circumstances of international business," he said. 
  POSCO's wage accord is expected to affect pay negotiations 
at 
other industrial companies in the Pohang region. 
  POSCO, which has some 22,622 workers, is the world's second 
biggest iron and steel maker with production last year estimated 
at 22.48 million tons.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 18 (YONHAP) -- The government is giving 
serious consideration to guaranteeing illegal aliens the same 
treatment as Korean workers under the labor standard law and 
industrial accident insurance law. 
  The Korea Labor Institute (KLI) has recommended the step and 
Labor Minister Nam Chae-hui has approved it, KLI President Kim 
Tae-mo said Tuesday. 
  President Kim Yong-sam ordered humane treatment of illegal 
foreign workers Jan. 13, when the Labor Ministry reported on its 
new year agenda, and Nam instructed KLI to study the matter, Kim 
said. 
  The recommendation is based on Article 5 of the Labor 
Standard Law, which says that a foreign worker in the country 
and with a contract, even if it is illegal, cannot be treated 
unfairly on the basis of nationality or religion. 
  There are some 56,000 illegal alien workers in the country 
and most work for small- and medium-sized industrial companies. 
  It is KLI's argument that the government tacitly approved 
their contracts by overlooking their illegal presence and 
employment and it must therefore take the responsibility. 
  Before the Ministry can take any action, it must discuss the 
matter with the Justice Ministry, which opposes labor rights for 
illegal aliens under Article 15 of the Immigration Control Law, 
which says foreigners without residential qualifications as 
stated by the president may not be employed.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 14 (YONHAP) -- Abolished in 1958, Labor 
Day will be celebrated in South Korea on May 1, 1995, for the 
first time in 36 years, the government and its party decided 
Friday. 
  Labor Minister Nam Chae-hui, Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] 
Director General of Policy Coordination Paek Nam-chi, and other 
government and DLP officials agreed to revive Labor Day but put 
off revision of the law for a year to reflect upon the position 
of employers. 
  The move to reform labor policy seems aimed at easing worker 
dissatisfaction on the eve of spring wage negotiations. 
  Dissident labor organizations, but not the Federation of 
Korean Trade Unions (FKTU), have asked for a revival of Labor 
Day for 36 years. FKTU, which stuck to Worker's Day (March 10), 
officially decided to ask for the return of Labor Day in 1990. 
  In spite of the delay, party officials say they expect the 
decision to revive Labor Day to be welcomed. 
  President Syngman Yi abolished Labor Day in 1958 and 
replaced 
it with March 10, anniversary of the founding of the right-wing 
predecessor of FKTU, as Worker's Day.

and Social Affairs plans to introduce pensions for farmers and 
fishermen to compensate them for rice market opening, ministry 
officials said Friday. 
  The ministry will finalize the system by June and present 
its 
proposal to the National Assembly in autumn for introduction 
next year. 
  Businesses with more than five employees must join the 
national pension scheme. Contributions of 6 percent of wages 
are shared by the employee (4 percent) and his employer (2 
percent) according to the national pension law. 
  Anyone else who wants to join the system may, but they must 
pay all 6 percent themselves. 
  According to a tentative plan drawn up by the ministry, 
about 
995,000 households in farming and fishing villages and 650,000 
non-farming or fishing households in rural areas will be obliged 
to join the national pension scheme. 
  In rural areas, contributions and pensions will be paid on a 
per household basis instead of an individual basis. Pensions 
are payable from the 60th birthday of the head of the household. 
  An official said, however, that the ministry is still 
studying whether to share the contributions. 
  The government also has to decide what percent of income -- 
3 
percent or 6 percent -- rural people should pay toward their 
pensions.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 14 (YONHAP) -- Opposition leader Yi 
Ki-taek openly threw his support behind realignment of local 
administrative units Friday, rekindling the talk of a massive 
rezoning that President Kim Yong-sam had silenced, though he 
said he was still opposed to dividing up the city of Seoul. 
  "We shouldn't blindly oppose it. We will review it," Yi 
said. 
  "Proposals for rezoning in the past were just gerrymandering 
before an election, but as long as it is conducted fairly, it's 
worth consideration," the Democratic Party leader said. 
  DP Spokesman Pak Chi-won confirmed Yi's remarks, saying the 
redistricting "should be done if necessary." 
  The realignment of administrative units would include 
merging 
cities and counties before the mayoral, gubernatorial and local 
elections in the first half of next year. 
  Stories were floated last week that the ruling party was 
ready to split up Seoul as well because it was concerned an 
opposition figure would be elected mayor, a position so powerful 
it is called the no. 2 post after the president, and hamper the 
administration. 
  President Kim immediately dismissed the idea, and Yi said 
Friday that Seoul "can never be" divided. 
  DP officials said a party leadership meeting early next week 
will formulate the party's official position on administrative 
redistricting.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 21 (YONHAP) -- Hanhwa Group Chairman Kim 
Sung-yon was sentenced to one year in prison with a two-year 
suspension and fined 4,723 million won (5.83 million U.S. 
dollars) Friday in a Seoul District Criminal Court for 
violation of the Foreign Exchange Control Law. 
  "The accused deserves heavy punishment because he illegally 
bought a luxurious mansion in a foreign country with a 
commission he received in relation to overseas business," the 
bench said in passing sentence. 
  "But the court grants him a stay of execution, considering 
that he deeply repents of his actions and that the government is 
revising the Foreign Exchange Control Law to keep pace with the 
internationalization era." 
  Kim was arrested in November and charged with diverting 6.5 
million dollars in commissions paid to a Hanhwa subsidiary for a 
construction deal in Saudi Arabia to buy a home in Los Angeles. 
  The prosecution demanded Jan. 13 that he be sentenced to 
three years in prison and fined 5.8 million dollars.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 17 (YONHAP) -- The Hyundai Business 
Group is likely to continue to have a hard time obtaining 
assistance from Korea Development Bank [KDB] or other 
state-invested financial organizations as long as group founder 
Chong Chu-yong remains active in management of the conglomerate, 
a senior government source said Monday. 
  The government has reacted coolly to repeated calls for an 
easing of the financial restrictions from group management, the 
source said. 
  Hyundai Chairman Chong Se-yong, a younger brother of Chong, 
asked President Kim Yong-sam in their tete-a-tete in September 
for his help in having financial institutions resume financial 
assistance to Hyundai, and a similar appeal was made to Economic 
Planning Minister Chong Chae-sok last week, but to no avail, the 
source said. 
  Even close aides to the president and some cabinet ministers 
have tried to persuade Kim to ease the restrictions, but Kim has 
reportedly hinted that there is no possibility of the government 
relaxing its position with regard to Hyundai. 
  Hyundai's relations with the government soured so much after 
Chong entered politics two years ago that the group has 
continuously been excluded from the beneficiaries of KDB 
facility investment loans and other financial assistance.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 20 (YONHAP) -- The Board of Audit and 
Inspection (BAI) told the Transportation Ministry Thursday its 
decision to build the track and stations of the Seoul-Pusan 
high-speed railway at ground level rather than underground was 
made without proper study or consultation with other government 
agencies, and it has to be reviewed. 
  In June last year, it was decided to construct the 
high-speed 
train stations and tracks in Seoul, Taegu and Taejon at ground 
level to save 1.43 trillion won. 
  BAI said, however, that this increases the length of the 
line 
from 421.7 kilometers to 430.7 km and boosts trip time from 
108.5 minutes to 124 minutes, and instead of saving money it 
adds to the annual cost by 17.5 billion won. Because the change 
was decided without sufficient consultation with concerned 
agencies, a barrage of complaints against building South Seoul 
Station in a conservation zone and concerning the ground-level 
track between Taegu and Taejon are causing delays in the 
project, a BAI spokesman said. 
  The BAI said it looked into the screening of high-speed 
train 
systems fairly and in detail but found no faults, except for 
some suggestions it cannot reveal because negotiations with the 
priority candidate, GEC-Alsthom, are ongoing. 
  Although Maglev trains excel in tests, they cost up to 30 
percent more than wheel-on-rail trains, and because they are yet 
to be commercialized they proved to be unfit for the Seoul-Pusan 
line, according to the BAI assessment. 
  The investigative agency also advised using a more realistic 
means of fund procurement after finding problems with the 
current plan for obtaining 331.6 billion won, 31 percent of the 
total cost of 10.74 trillion won, by issuing long-term, 
short-term and overseas bonds. 
  Issuance of short-term bonds might raise market interest 
rates and floatation of overseas bonds is difficult under 
related laws, BAI noted. It also faulted design of gradient 
sections for wasting 1.32 trillion won and demanded a revision 
in tunnel designs. 
  BAI ordered stronger anti-noise measures since the 
authorities stated track-side noise levels from passing trains 
at 86 decibels when they are actually 93 db. 
  It was also critical of the project's administration as 
division of work between the Transportation Ministry and Korea 
High-Speed Railway Authority is unclear and they have too few 
high-speed railway experts.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 14 (YONHAP) -- Selling short will be 
allowed but institutional investors must deposit 20 percent of 
the purchase price of stock under the measures the Korea 
Securities Exchange will put into effect on Monday to cool the 
market. 
  The Korea Securities Dealers Association decided at a 
meeting 
Thursday morning to lift the ban imposed on selling short in May 
1990, when the market was depressed. 
  To sell short is to sell shares borrowed from a broker and 
then repurchase them for return at a fixed future date. 
  This is an expansion of margin transactions, where investors 
buy stock on credit. 
  Selling short will be limited to shares of companies listed 
in the first section of the exchange, and a broker may lend no 
more than 20 million won of shares per investor provided that 
its total on loan is no more than 50 percent of its equity 
capital and that the total lending by all brokerage houses is no 
more than 10 percent of the total listed shares. 
  The securities industry has long considered reviving short 
selling in preparation for opening a stock futures market, an 
event that no longer lies in the distant future. 
  Institutional investors such as banks, and securities, 
short-term finance and investment trust firms, must now deposit 
at least 20 percent of the purchase price with a broker before 
bidding to buy stock. 
  Since real-name financial transactions were introduced last 
August, institutional investors have carried a greater weight in 
the stock market, and some are suspected of manipulating stock 
prices by abusing their no-deposit privileges. 
  Individual investors must deposit 40 percent of the purchase 
price.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 18 (YONHAP) -- Legislation aimed at 
nullifying the validity of passports held by Koreans overseas 
who refuse to return to Korea to face indictment appears on the 
verge of being killed due to formidable opposition from the 
National Assembly, which argues it contains "elements" that 
could violate human rights, informed government sources said 
Tuesday. 
  The Foreign and Justice Ministries have been studying the 
possibility of giving changes to the amendment bill so that 
human rights are not an issue, but they now seem to be leaning 
toward withdrawing the amendment bill altogether owing to 
difficulties of setting up practical standards for deciding 
crimes to be governed. 
  Foreign Ministry officials said Tuesday that lawmakers of 
the 
ruling and opposition parties persistently opposed revising the 
passport law during the last regular session. 
  The lawmakers argued, they said, that if the government 
imposes administrative action, depriving citizens of valid 
passports just because they are under suspicion of having 
violated law, it could very well infringe upon individual rights. 
  If the government, ignoring the diversity of crimes 
involved, 
applies the law uniformly and nullifies the passport of every 
Korean who faces indictment at home, it would not only be fair 
to all but also produce many Koreans indefinitely staying in 
foreign countries illegally. 
  One senior ministry official said the government is studying 
the possibility of applying the law on those who committed grave 
crimes and economic crimes, which could receive prison terms of 
three years or more. But even this idea ran into difficulties, 
he said. 
  "As a result, the bill has been scrapped in all practical 
points of view," he said. 
  Had the bill been adopted, a number of Korean citizens who 
are currently staying abroad to escape prosecution could have 
become illegal aliens in the countries where they live. 
  These include Kim Chong-hi, a former senior presidential 
secretary for foreign and national security affairs living in 
the United States who is under suspicion of receiving bribes in 
connection with the Yulgok military buildup program, and former 
Rep. Yi Won-cho, who is staying in Japan to escape investigation 
of questionable financial dealings.

  [Text] Pusan, Jan. 15 (YONHAP) -- The Pusan Waterworks 
Agency reported on Saturday that the water quality of its water 
treatment plants has been restored to pre-pollution normalcy. 
  The report said the ammonia and nitrogen content stood at 
0.45ppm in treated water at Toksan water treatment plant and 
0.48ppm at Hwamyong plant, respectively, Saturday morning, below 
the tolerable level of 0.5ppm. 
  A public uproar erupted on Jan. 8 after toxic smell was 
smelt 
and a high content of hazardous substances was detected at 
piped-water in the Pusan area. 
  The waterworks agency also said no more benzene and toluene 
were detected at Mulkum and Maeri water intake yards or in 
piped-water in five separate areas in Pusan on Friday.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 14 (YONHAP) -- The good news is that 
South Koreans became much more richer and in the world's fastest 
speed, but the bad news is that the country is underdeveloped in 
most other areas, particularly in environment. 
  Korea's per capita national income growth was the world's 
greatest in 1985-1992, with an average rise of 8.5 percent, 
according to indicators of a creditable institution. 
  Elementary school enrollment rate was 100 percent for Korea, 
sharing the top place with France, Britain, Japan, China, and 10 
other countries. 
  "The World Bank Atlas 1994", a book of comparative 
indicators 
of population, economy, and environment of 207 countries with 
the help of the associated United Nations agencies like the 
International Labor Organization and United Nations Educational, 
Scientific, and Cultural Organization, was obtained and released 
Friday by the Finance Ministry. 
  But Korea showed energy inefficiency with its gross domestic 
product (GDP) per one kilogram estimated at 3.4 U.S. dollars 
and scored low in most other indicators in comparison with 
advanced countries. 
  Korea ranked 15th with a GNP (gross national product) of 
296.3 billion dollars, in the similar line with Australia (299.3 
billion dollars) and Mexico (294.8 billion dollars). Per capita 
national income was 6,790 dollars, the world's 32th. 
  Per capita income grew 8.5 percent from 1985 to 1992, the 
world's greatest, and all South Koreans had primary schooling, 
sharing the priviledge of just 14 other countries. Illiteracy, 
in result, was just 4 percent. 
  China topped with the biggest population of 1.17 billion, 
followed by India with 880 million, and the United States with 
260 million. Korea ranked 25th with 44.66 million. 
  Population growth in 1985-1992 was 1 percent, the world's 
57th, and average life expectancy was 71 years old, 61th on the 
rankings. 
  Per capita woman employment rate was 34 percent (68th) and 
child birth per a woman was 1.8, the world's 16th lowest. 
Under-one infant death rate was 13 per every 10,000 live 
births, the world's 42th, doubling the number of five in Japan. 
  Inflation in 1985-1992 averaged 6.8 percent, the world's 
68th, and farming share in the GDP was 8 percent (38th), exports 
portion, 29 percent (66th), and investment accounting for 39 
percent (eighth). 
  Per capita energy consumption was 1,936 kilograms (40th) and 
GDP estimation of one kg of energy was 3.4 dollars, the world's 
76th, just half of Japan's 7.6 dollars. 
  Withdrawals of water resources in 1970-1989 was 17 percent 
(32th) and per capital water withdrawals was 299 square meters 
(65th). Forest area was 65 square kilometers, compared with 
North Korea's 90 square kilometers.

  [Text] The scope of businesses qualified for foreign 
currency loans will be extended to purchasers of airplanes and 
second-hand ships and small- and medium-sized companies which 
introduce high technologies from abroad, starting from today. 
  The Bank of Korea has revised foreign currency loan-related 
regulations in such a way as to expand foreign currency loans to 
enterprises in a bid to promote corporate facility investment 
and to lessen companies' financial burden, it said yesterday. 
  Under the revised regulations, the ratio of foreign currency 
loans extended to businesses has been raised. The foreign 
currency ratio for large-sized manufacturers which import 
facility equipment will be raised from 80 percent of import 
prices to 90 percent and for small-sized companies, from 90 to 
100 percent. 
  The comparable ratio for enterprises which seek direct 
investment abroad will also be raised by 10 percentage points to 
70 percent of the invested fund for large companies and by 10 
percentage points to 80 percent for small companies. 
  Along with this, a maximum maturity for foreign currency 
loans will be extended from the current eight years to 10 years, 
considering long-term fund demands such as importers of plants 
or airplanes, the central bank said. 
  The central bank also abolished regulation requiring 
domestic 
businesses to acquire prior recommendation from the Ministry of 
Industry, Trade and Energy when they import facility equipment 
from Japan. 
  In the past, the recommendation system was introduced to 
curb 
excessive imports of various facility equipment, including 
machinery. 
  The central bank also allowed foreign currency-dealing banks 
to have a free hand in determining grace periods and repayment 
methods of foreign currency loans raised by themselves. 
  Meanwhile, the central bank plans to provide $3 billion out 
of its foreign reserve holdings to foreign currency banks in the 
first half of the year. 
  Now, the central bank is offering foreign currency funds at 
Libor (London Inter-Bank Offered Rate) to foreign currency banks 
which in turn loan the funds to enterprises at an annual rate of 
0.5-1.0 percent above Libor.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 21 (YONHAP) -- Each company wishing to 
take part in the second mobile phone network project has been 
given 24 hours to form its own consortium and present a formal 
application to the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI). 
  FKI, which was commissioned by the government to form a 
single consortium for the multibillion-dollar project by next 
month, had decided Friday to oblige all aspiring companies to 
form their own consortia by Saturday to be screened for their 
eligibility, a FKI spokesman said. 
  It made major headway in its responsibility after the 
Sunkyong Group, chaired by FKI Chairman Choe Chong-hyon, 
announced it was dropping out of the project and would instead 
bid for control of the state-run cellular monopoly, Korea Mobile 
Telecom, earlier in the week. 
  The Ssangyong Group followed suit to ease the traffic by 
giving up its bid for leading shareholder of the second cellular 
network. 
  Remaining competitors among the six consortia that vied 
until 
Sunkyong won in August 1992, but returned the license over 
alleged political favoritism, are Pohang Iron and Steel Co., 
Kolon Group, Dongbu group, and Tongyang Group. 
  With Sunkyong and Ssangyong giving up, the competition for 
the leading role in the second mobile project narrows down to 
Sinsegi Mobile of Posco and Second Mobile of Kolon. 
  Making all applicants form a new consortium was the best way 
to solve the complicated problem of allowing just the four 
companies in the project or randomly giving stakes to any 
company that wants them, the spokesman said. 
  Under the decision, the four companies that have long 
prepared for the business stand in a very advantageous position 
and other firms that wish to have a stake in the new cellular 
network will have to join one of the four. 
  FKI will decide and announce the screening criteria on 
Monday.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 17 (YONHAP) -- The Sunkyong Group will 
not join the consortium for the second mobile phone project, 
instead seeking to be the leading shareholder in Korea Mobile 
Telecom when part of Korea Telecom's shares in the company go on 
sale, Federation of Korean Industries (FKI) Executive Vice 
Chairman Cho Kyu-ha said Monday. 
  FKI, chaired by Sunkyong Chairman Choe Chong-hyon, was 
authorized to form a single consortium to carry out the 
multibillion U.S.-dollar project by late next month. 
  Getting all of the bidders to form a single consortium and 
selling stock in state-funded Korea Mobile was the government's 
way of finally getting the show on the road since Sunkyong had 
to give up the business license after beating five competitors 
in August 1992 over suspicion of nepotism as Choe was related to 
then- President No Tae-u by the marriage of their children. 
  It now looks as if Sunkyong will be the main stockholder in 
Korea Mobile, and either POSCO or Kolon the leading shareholder 
in the new cellular phone company. 
  In an unofficial board meeting at the weekend, Choe said 
that 
his group had decided to give up the second mobile phone project 
to live up to the expectations of the government and the public 
and for the sake of business unity. 
  Ssangyong Group Chairman Kim Sok-won said his group will not 
seek to be leading shareholder of the new mobile phone company. 
  That narrows the competition down to Sinsegi Mobile of 
Pohang 
Iron and Steel Co. and Second Mobile of the Kolon Group. Dongbu 
Mobile of the Dongbu Group and Tongyang Mobile of the Tongyang 
Group did not apply for the leadership position. 
  After Choe announced that his group was withdrawing, FKI 
gave 
its support for Sunkyong to be prime shareholder of Korea Mobile. 
  With the unanimous support for Sunkyong in its bid for Korea 
Mobile, POSCO is likely to concentrate on gaining control of the 
new cellular phone company.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 14 (YONHAP) -- Fifty cable television 
stations proposed to the government Friday average monthly fees 
of 11,580 won (14.27 U.S. dollars). 
  Charges will vary by region and number of channels, but the 
stations in general agree on between 10,000 won and 12,000 won a 
month. One-time subscription fees, however, vary from 10,000 
won in Haeundae, Pusan, to 105,000 won in northwestern Pusan, 
and average 50,000 won. 
  Subscribers can tune into 20 channels that range from 
YONHAP's 24-hour news channel to film and sports as 46 stations 
have said they will carry all 20 channels. The four other 
incorporated stations, including one in Kwanak-ku, Seoul, will 
carry 16 channels, excluding women, music, education and culture 
channels. 
  Local channels proposed transmitting local information eight 
and half hours a day on average, with a regional difference of 
between one and 15 hours. 
  The 50 stations predicted subscription rates at 11.33 
percent 
next year, the first year of cable television, rising to 25.3 
percent by 1997. 
  Total capital averages 3.3 billion won with the minimum 2.5 
billion won in Inchon and maximum 8 billion won in Chongno and 
central Seoul. 
  The stations projected a surplus by 1998 and losses covered 
some time after 2001. 
  Most of them said they will not sell advertising at first, 
but will consider between 5 percent and 50 percent of air time 
later. 
  They said they will use Korean equipment 73.7 percent on 
average. The Information Ministry announced the 50 final 
stations after a second screening based on public interest and 
broadcasting ability.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 20 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's 
shipbuilding industry is expected to maintain its competitive 
edge over Japan as long as there is no great change in foreign 
exchange rates. 
  The prediction is based on the facts that Korean 
shipbuilders 
can undercut Japanese-built ship prices while they can compete 
against the Japanese in quality and marketing, according to a 
report issued Thursday by the Korea Institute for Industrial 
Economy and Trade. 
  The report said the general technological level of Korean 
shipbuilders is below that of the Japanese, but the quality of 
products, marketing and after-sales service are almost on a par 
with the Japanese. 
  In price competition, however, Korean yards are far ahead of 
the Japanese, offsetting their weak points, it said. Especially 
because of the rising value of the yen from last year, their 
competitive power has continued to rise. 
  As a result, Korean shipbuilders are expected to maintain 
their edge over their Japanese counterparts as long as the 
foreign exchange trend keeps up, it said. 
  Against Chinese shipbuilders, meanwhile, the Koreans lag 
slightly behind in price competitiveness but Korea far outpaces 
China in all other aspects including technology, marketing, 
financing, after- sales service and marketing, it said. 
  Compared with European shipyards, it said, Korean 
shipbuilders are far ahead. In other aspects, they are either 
on a par or slightly ahead of European builders, it added.

  [Text] Prospects for implementation and success of the 
Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle brightened somewhat 
after the second ministerial meeting on the issue ended 
yesterday. Thai and Indonesian officials and their private 
sectors in particular were delighted about the outcome of the 
meeting. Their Malaysian counterparts, who before the meeting 
were said to have difficulty joining the project, turned out to 
be more willing than expected to make necessary adjustments. 
  The Indonesian, Malaysian and Thai governments will consider 
all business councils' proposals under the growth triangle 
project before submitting their decisions to the third 
ministerial meeting in May, in Medan, Indonesia. 
  Ministers from the three countries agreed to accept the 
private sector's proposals at the meeting yesterday. They also 
signed "agreed minutes" as a record of what they discussed. 
  Thai and Indonesian private sectors have signed a memorandum 
of understanding to jointly invest in the growth triangle. The 
Malaysians need to sort out some problems before joining the 
move. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Panitchaphak and National 
Economic and Social Development Board Secretary-General Dr 
Phisit Phakkasem as well as the Thai private sector were pleased 
about the outcome of the meeting. 
  Dr Suphachai said the meeting agreed to endorse the Asian 
Development Bank's [ADB's] study on the growth triangle, but 
recommended the bank's study, which will be submitted to the 
third ministerial meeting, should take into consideration the 
following issues: 
  -- The ADB's report should emphasise the competitiveness of 
this scheme with other projects; 
  -- it should look at the possibilities of investment from 
investors outside the region; 
  -- it should have much more details of energy and power 
investment 
  -- its comments should contain more details. 
  Dr Suphachai said the meeting also adopted the business 
councils' proposals. 
  Before the third ministerial meeting begins, the governments 
are to come up with decisions on the business councils' 
proposals, if not all of them. 
  "I can say that the success of the project at this meeting 
came as a result of sincerity shown by the three countries. In 
the past we thought about our government first," Dr Suphachai 
said. 
  Tun Daim Zainuddin, minister coordinating the project for 
Malaysia, said he would submit all business council proposals to 
the Malaysian Government as soon as possible. He thought the 
Malaysian Government would come up with some decisions on three 
joint proposals between Thailand and Malaysia. 
  These proposals are to open the border for 24 hours a day, 
to 
reduce from five cents to one cent a kilo the fee Malaysia 
charges on marine product imports from Thailand, and use of Thai 
packaging containers to carry Thai marine products. 
  He said although the Malaysian Government could not open the 
border between Thailand and Malaysia for 24 hours, it might 
lengthen the opening time. 
  Thai investors should join Malaysian investors to produce 
packaging containers, Mr Zainuddin suggested. 
  Before reducing the fee on marine product imports, the 
Malaysian Government would look at the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade because it was afraid that the change would 
run counter to the pact. A cut would have to apply to all 
countries not just Thailand. However, he said the border 
opening hours and marine product packaging problems would be 
resolved before the third ministerial meeting. Malaysia would 
have answers on these issues for Thailand. If the Malaysian 
Government could not accommodate such proposals, it would have 
strong reasons. 
  Malaysia wanted to see tourists from the region require only 
border passes, not passports, when entering one another's 
countries. 
  Mr Hartarto, Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Industry 
and Trade, said his Government would consider all proposals to 
remove trade and tariff barriers for Thai and Malaysian 
investors. But their removal would be within the framework of 
the GATT agreement. He said Thais would be the first to invest 
in Indonesia under the project. 
  Kasit Phirom, the Thai ambassador to Indonesia, said he 
would 
go to Medan to help Thais examine investment in Medan. He will 
ask the Transport and Communications Ministry and Thai Airways 
International to consider new flights for investors in the 
region. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan, during his trip to 
Indonesia on February 6 and 7, will discuss with him ways to 
help Thais who want to invest in Indonesia. 
  Mr Kasit said he would look at the investment laws of the 
two 
countries, investment locations, promotion and transport. He 
will discuss investment promotion methods with the Tourism 
Office, commercial consultants in Indonesia, THAI, and companies 
already involved in Indonesia such as Charoen Phokphan or 
Bangkok Bank. 
  The Thai Embassy will hold an exhibition in Indonesia twice, 
one in Surabaya and another in Medan. The exhibition in Medan 
will be in the first half of this year. 
  Dr Phisit said the second meeting of the project was 
successful because these countries had the same level of 
development.

  [Text] The Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand [I-M-T] Growth 
Triangle (IMT-GT) Business Council, formed by private sectors of 
the three countries, has submitted its proposals to the second 
ministerial meeting, which yesterday adopted them for further 
consideration by their governments. 
  The proposals involve the economic development of northern 
Sumatera, northern Malaysia and southern Thailand, as well as 
intensifying private/public-sector cooperation. 
  The council's meeting was in five workshops where delegates 
discussed opportunities for business collaboration, as well as 
issues requiring government attention to help the movement of 
goods, services, labour and capital into the three development 
sub-regions. The five workshops were as follows: 
  1. Agriculture; 
  2. Infrastructure 
  3. Tourism 
  4. Trade, Industry and Investment; and 
  5. Human Resource Development. 
  Government Help 
  The meeting identified the following issues and constraints 
relating to government administrative procedures and policies 
that could affect the efficient conduct of business and required 
immediate attention. 
  Trade, Industry and Investment 
  -- The current practice of 6 A.M.-6 P.M. opening hours of 
the 
Malaysia-Thailand border crossing could be restrictive. To help 
trade between northern peninsular Malaysia and southern 
Thailand, it was proposed that the opening hours of the border 
crossing should be extended to 24. 
  -- Currently, there are only two open customs checkpoints 
between Malaysia and Thailand. To help free flow of trade 
between the two countries, it was proposed that all border 
points be opened. In addition, it was proposed that a single 
joint customs checkpoint between Malaysia and Thailand be 
established in place of the existing separate checkpoints on 
both sides. This would reduce waiting time and customs manpower 
requirements. 
  -- To enable free movement of vehicles within the IMT-GT 
region, it was proposed that a co-vehicle insurance policy 
scheme be initiated. 
  -- In the context of setting up new businesses under the 
IMT-GT collaborations and joint ventures, bureaucratic approval 
procedures could pose a serious constraints to the business 
sector. In this regard, it is proposed that these procedures, 
such as licensing and rules, be simplified and streamlined and 
that a one-stop agency be set up to serve as the reference point 
and central approving body to facilitate the business community 
in the IMT-GT. 
  -- Differences in equity conditions and investment 
incentives 
between the three countries need to be reviewed to make the 
Growth Triangle more attractive to local and foreign investors. 
It was, therefore, proposed that a special task force be formed 
among the three private sectors of the IMT-GT to examine these 
existing conditions. 
  The meeting hoped that the ministerial meeting would endorse 
the formation of this task force and that the relevant 
government agencies of the respective countries would extend the 
necessary cooperation and assistance to the task force, and 
ultimately give weight and consideration to the task force 
recommendations. 
  Agriculture 
  -- Currently, the Malaysian Government requires the use of 
only Malaysian-made plastic crates for transporting marine 
products. It was proposed to allow the utilisation of plastic 
crates made by other countries. It was also proposed that 
Malaysia should reduce the service charge of five cents to one 
cent per kg to help trade in marine products. 
  -- The meeting proposed greater liberalisation of rubber 
trade within the region by eliminating current artificial 
restrictions. 
  Infrastructure 
  -- The meeting proposed the immediate reduction of 
international telephone charges within the IMT-GT region to 
promote investment, trade and tourism, as well as foster closer 
relationships between the three countries. 
  Proposed Projects To Be Implemented under the IMT-GT 
Project 
  For immediate action: 
  -- Request for assistance from the governments of each of 
the three countries to organise joint tourism promotion. 
  -- The use of Malaysia-Indonesia-Thailand Tourism 
Association (MITTA) as a channel for complaints and help 
tourists and tourism information in the region. 
  -- Developing and marketing of industrial estates and 
southern Thailand to promote collaboration between the private 
sectors of Malaysia and Thailand. 
  -- Promotion of manufacturing of wooden furniture, 
especially from rubber wood and rattan, by the three countries. 
  -- Looking at the possibility of establishing an IMT 
skills development centre. 
  -- Develop joint fishing in the three countries. 
  -- Looking for the possibility of establishing fruit and 
vegetable common market in border areas. 
  -- Liberalise rubber trading within the region. 
  -- The development of a regional television broadcasting 
station, a land bridge interconnecting system, linking the west 
coast and east coast of the region and power generation 
facilities, requires from the government approval in principle 
and feasibility studies. These projects are to be 
private-sector-driven. 
  -- Bandar Aceh-Penang-Thailand natural gas pipeline 
towards the development of energy resources within the IMT-GT 
region. 
  -- Ban Gabang (Yala)-Sik (Kedah) road to improve land 
transport between the two areas. The distance could be reduced 
from 141 km to 60 km. 
  -- Ban Bhuketa (Waeng, Narathiwat) Malay-Thai border 
bridge to improve land transport between Narathiwat and the 
three Malaysian states of Kedah, Perlis and Perak (East-West 
Highway). 
  -- Satun-Perlis road to improve land transport. The 
present road link does not allow passage of heavy trucks. 
  -- An air transport network project to accelerate 
multilateral aviation arrangement within the region. 
  For long-term action: 
  -- To look into the possibility of establishing 
cooperation and joint investment in electronics and electrical 
components. 
  -- Satun-Penang-Medan-Bandar Aceh Sea Link to promote 
inter-regional trading and encourage tourism. 
  Conclusion 
  The Business Council wants to record its support and 
confidence in the IMT-GT project. It is pleased to make its 
small initial contribution to the attainment of IMT-GT project 
objectives by submitting the proceeding report of its inaugural 
meeting to the official meeting. 
  The council believes that the proposals, issues and 
observations can lead to a more conducive environment for the 
pursuit of the objectives of the IMT-GT. Similarly, projects 
identified represent infrastructural upgrades, as well as 
business opportunities, for the private sector.

  [Text] Singapore -- Ships sailing through Southeast Asian 
waters last year enjoyed some respite from marauders. In 1993, 
the Regional Piracy Centre in Kuala Lumpur received only eight 
reports of pirate attacks in the region, compared with 73 in the 
previous year and 107 in 1991. The figures were disclosed in a 
report released from Kuala Lumpur on Friday. 
  Piracy seems to be on the decline worldwide. The centre, 
which was set up in 1992 and is part of the International 
Maritime Bureau, received 103 reports of piracy incidents last 
year. By comparison, there were 107 incidents in 1992 and 115 
in 1991. Most of the incidents took place in the first half of 
last year. Between January and June last year, 76 raids on ships 
took place. From July onwards, the number fell to just 27. 
  Asia remained the piracy hot spot, with a total of 81 
attacks 
taking place on ships sailing through Asian waters. Another 
seven robberies occurred on vessels parked at various Indonesian 
ports. 
  While attacks in Southeast Asia have abated, more incidents 
have been reported in the Hong Kong-Luzon-Hainan (HLH) area. 
Last year, 33 attacks were launched against vessels passing 
through the HLH triangle. 
  Another 20 took place in the East China Sea, with a further 
12 on vessels sailing through the South China Sea. In its 
latest update, the centre also disclosed that there were three 
reported attacks on ships in the first two weeks of this year. 
  One was an attack on the GYOKO MARU on January 10. Three 
pirates boarded the vessel while it was in international waters 
approaching the Singapore Strait at the Philip Channel. The 
attackers got away with more than U.S.$6.000 in cash. 
  Another incident took place in the South China Sea on 
January 
5 when 20 pirates raided the JUI HO. The marauders took over 
the vessel for two-and-a-half days, before escaping with more 
than 5,000 cartons of cigarettes. And on January 11, 10 armed 
men wearing Chinese uniforms tried to board the PEDER MOST. 
However, they gave up after trying unsuccessfully for 
half-an-hour.

<F P=106> [Speech by First Prime Minister Prince Krompreah Norodom </F>
Ranariddh in Kampot Province on 23 January -- recorded] 
  [Text] Concerning Cambodian territory, as his majesty has 
already mentioned, no one can divide it. There must be only one 
Cambodian territory within the territorial integrity recognized 
since 1962. It is indivisible. However, as all of you know, I 
came here on my provincial tour to look at the overall situation 
and especially to see if there is potential for boosting our 
economy, because up to the present our national budget has 
proved to be insufficient if we are to rely only on taxes. The 
national income in 1994 is just $280 million and that is not 
enough. The tax money will run out soon. The bulk of our 
budget comes from international aid. So, if we Cambodians only 
rely on taxes and international aid, we will experience great 
difficulties one day. As I said, the budget of 1994 is not 
sufficient. We need to attract as much foreign investment as 
possible. 
  I and His Excellency Second Prime Minister Hun Sen together 
with the government delegation recently visited China. We saw 
great prosperity in China. China claims to be a communist state 
but in reality it is communist only because it still adorns 
itself with red flags. Besides that, there is nothing communist 
about China. It is very, very prosperous. For this reason, my 
wish is to see our people's living standard improve. We are 
poor but we have so much natural resources. We should let 
others come in to exploit them. To attract investors into our 
country, there must be four main factors, as the Chinese have 
just told me. 
  First, there must be political stability and security. We 
could form our royal coalition government because all major 
parties listened to the correct advice of our venerated king. 
So, we have been united and this has led to a degree of 
political stability. As for the Khmer Rouge problem, I have 
already said that we must settle it peacefully. However, if the 
Khmer Rouge refuse, what can I do? One day the national assembly 
and the royal government would blame me, Ranariddh, for that. 
But I have tried and I must continue to try. 
  There is another kind of stability. I would like to take 
this opportunity to deal with the important issue of staging 
demonstrations. This issue is closely related to human rights. 
The government, the constitution strictly stipulates respect 
for human rights. At the same time we all recognize that the 
Kingdom of Cambodia is a legal state, a state that abides by the 
law. Everything must be undertaken within the legal framework. 
For example, there is the press law, the law on holding 
demonstrations, and the law on staging strikes. These laws are 
respected in all developed countries, such as the French 
Republic which has professed democracy since 1789, the United 
States, and Germany. As far as democracy is concerned, these 
countries are very developed. Still, they are under the law. 
Having laws does not mean that freedom and human rights are 
stunted. Guarantees for democracy and human rights can be made 
through laws. Respect for laws guarantees democracy and 
legality. Therefore, the people are asked to please be more 
understanding. We do not forbid you from staging demonstrations 
and strikes. Before reaching the stage of demonstrations and 
strikes, however, there are many other solutions. The royal 
government is here to help you solve your problems. Moreover, 
everything should be made within the legal framework. If we 
stray from the legal framework, I am afraid the Khmer Rouge 
might take the opportunity to instigate unrest. I am not going 
to detail the possible dangers of staging demonstrations, but if 
there are some disturbances, what should our authorities, our 
royal government do? They would have to react. If this 
happens, one thing that you want -- that is, democracy -- will 
surely be hurt. So, I beg you to have pity for the nation. It 
does not mean that we are not trying to solve these problems for 
you. The royal government has the duty and obligation to solve 
all kinds of problems. 
  Second, if there are endless demonstrations, those who want 
to invest in our country, and there are many who do, would be 
frightened away. The investors have made me understand that 
they are most afraid of endless demonstrations in our country. 
They do not believe we have achieved political stability. If 
we do not have political stability, they will not come to invest 
in our country. We would remain poor and then where would we get 
the money to improve our lot? Therefore, if we want to have 
sufficient schools, hospitals, and medicine and prosperity for 
the people, we should make them come in to invest, to open many 
factories, and to create as many jobs for our people as 
possible. Thus, we must never frighten them away. They are 
very afraid of the volatile situation in Cambodia. They are 
afraid of the unrest in our society more than the Khmer Rouge. 
This is a fact. 
  Since we are talking about social stability, let us also 
mention the issue of contracts with the former State of 
Cambodia. If there is perpetual revision of these contracts, no 
one will have any trust in the future ones. They have said that 
just a few demonstrations were sufficient for us to revise 
contracts. I am not saying that we must not improve on them. 
We must make arrangements to improve on them, but let us not 
give potential investors the feeling of uncertainty about the 
future of contracts. Do not make them live in doubt about 
whether we are going to revise their contracts. The investors 
are most worried about the safety of their investment of 
hundreds of millions of dollars. 
  I also would like to take this opportunity to tell you 
about the Olympic market problem. In my capacity as the first 
prime minister, I would like to promise that I will do my best 
to solve this problem without harming the interests of both the 
businessmen and the poor. Nevertheless, to solve problems one 
needs to be understanding and compromising. It is not possible 
to let one side win 100 percent and another side to lose 100 
percent. We cannot permit one side to make excessive profit at 
the expense of the other, and vice versa. Statemanship, his 
majesty the king told me, is different from demagogy. I am a 
statesman and not a demagogue. I would prefer not to compete 
with demagogues. I would rather resign. Those who advocate 
statesmanship cannot compete with those who advocate demagogy. 
The people are asked to please understand that. Our government 
is not even three months old yet. That is what China called 
political and social stability. 
  The second factor, according to the Chinese, is cheap labor. 
We have plenty of labor in Cambodia. At least 2,000 young 
students graduate every year and they have nowhere to go. The 
problem is brewing here too. We must find jobs for them. So, 
we have plenty of labor and our labor is as cheap, if not 
cheaper than China's. 
  The third factor is real estate. Our land is still cheap 
compared to Hong Kong. We can solve this land problem despite 
the fact that there are many land speculators. We must correct 
this land situation. No one should be allowed to grab land at 
will. The state should impound state land. If we do not do 
this, we will not have land for foreign investors to come in and 
invest their money. This does not mean that we sell land to 
them. This does not mean that we Cambodians are less 
nationalistic than the likes of Messrs. Deng Xiaoping, Jiang 
Zemin, and Li Peng. The Chinese are doing what they are doing 
for the common interest of their nation. We must imitate them. 
Therefore, I beg those who are occupying land illegally to 
please return it to the state so that the state can grant it to 
investors for them to build factories on. The brothers who are 
living in poverty will then be given land to live elsewhere by 
the state and they will have jobs. They will therefore enjoy a 
better future. 
  The fourth factor is profit sharing. Investors should be 
given at least a 20 percent profit. That is in China. In our 
country a 20 percent profit seems very small because investors 
are not certain of their future here. Only when they see that 
they might gain more than 20 percent will they invest in our 
country. It is simple. We have no money at all and we want 
them to come in with their investment money. If they do not 
make profits they will not come. 
  You might want to ask me what our state will get out of it. 
The other day, I was told by the Chinese that our state would 
get a lot. We would have factories, for one thing. If they 
build factories in our country, where will these factories go? 
Where will the machinery in these factories go? In 10 years, 
15 years, or 20 years they will become ours. And to say that we 
have not built them ourselves. We now have no jobs and we are 
so miserable but we will have jobs and will be better off. 
Workers in Chinese factories are paid much better than state 
officials. What I wish to have most is jobs. We will be able 
to levy taxes and collect rents. The big profits we will make 
will be in 15, 20, or 30-year contracts. A hotel named [words 
indistinct] from Hong Kong and America built in Guangdong where 
I and His Excellency Hun Sen were staying was under a 50-year 
contract with China. The Chinese are not afraid to go into a 
50-year contract and will you say that the Chinese are less 
patriotic than we are? Not at all. They do virtually 
everything for the survival of their nation and for their 
economic development. China's economy is the hottest in the 
world and I wish Cambodia's is like that. 
  Just going around saying that we need to take from the rich 
and give to the poor is make believe. It is like Zorro in the 
movie. You know Zorro with the black mask in the movie. That 
kind of economy goes nowhere. So, I would refuse if I am asked 
to go into a contest for demagogy. Statesmanship has a 
different language from that of demagogy. Four or five years 
from now, maybe, it will be alright for us to practice demagogy 
for the elections. But now our problems are that we have no 
rice to eat and our people have no medicine and no schools. 
  The same thing can be said of the call for pay raises. I 
would like to ask those who have demanded pay raises whether the 
budget of our Economy and Finance Ministry can absorb all those 
adjustments? We have only $280 million now. When we no longer 
get international aid, where will we get the money for the 
raises? There can be raises only when our national budget 
amounts to $1 billion, $2 billion, or $3 billion and not $280 
million as it is now. Where can we get the extra money? [Words 
indistinct] but what we need is social and political stability 
so that other countries can come in and invest in tourism, where 
our ancestors left us with the world's unique wonder of Angkor 
Wat; in agriculture such as rubber, of which we can exploit only 
50,000 hectares and need to plant an additional 150,000 
hectares, and also in new crops. In the past, under Sangklum 
Reas Niyum [Sihanouk's pre-1970 ruling party], we exported as 
much as 800,000 metric tons of rice. We exported 800,000 metric 
tons of rice in 1970. Ironically, we are short of rice now. 
Those of you who are patriots are begged to please stay around 
the royal government and help it solve the agricultural problem 
which is a major issue, an issue of our livelihood. We all must 
work to get investments and factories. 
  As you know, in 1997 Hong Kong will be closed. Many 
countries around us want to come here. If we are not careful, 
let me tell you, investors will surely flock to Vietnam instead. 
Vietnam is enjoying stability and it is badmouthing us by 
telling everybody not to come to Cambodia because there are 
demonstrations everyday and the Khmer Rouge continue to be 
intractable. Why do you want to go to Cambodia, they say. Come 
to Vietnam where there are neither demonstrations nor the Khmer 
Rouge. Come and invest in Vietnam. In Cambodia you have to pay 
30 percent in taxes, but in Vietnam you only pay 10 percent. 
  I beg all of you to be understanding. Some have claimed that 
they cannot sleep. Me too, I cannot sleep at night. We are 
poor and we need to find ways to get money. We are getting very 
little aid. Do you know that when I went to China, that China 
gave us an interest-free loan of only $8 million? That is not 
much. Besides that, China only asked us to go into joint 
ventures in the PRC. There is neither much bilateral aid nor 
much multilateral aid. So, we must seek ways to increase our 
own resources so that we will earn important national capital. 
In the meantime we must allow other countries to invest here. 
As I have said, the main factor needed in our country is 
stability. 
  So, in conclusion I beg of all of you for pity and 
understanding. This does not mean that Ranariddh forbids 
demonstrations. I would like to stress again and again that so 
long as I remain first prime minister of the royal government, I 
pledge that I will always respect human rights and your right to 
stage demonstrations and strikes. The first thing I ask from 
you is that you should stay within the legal framework and 
behave yourselves like those in developed, civilized, countries. 
The second thing is that you should kindly rely on the royal 
government and let it take care of your problems first. You can 
stage demonstrations within the legal framework only after it 
fails. You should not forget that people are watching us. 
Since 23 October 1991, since the general elections, and since 
the formation of the royal government and the return of the 
constitutional monarchy, as his majesty has said, we have 
entered a new era, an era of independence, territorial 
integrity, and full sovereignty and an era in which we are 
making efforts to develop the nation in all fields. That is 
all. I come here with all their excellencies and not just for 
rest and recreation at Kep. I have to take a look there because 
it is a tourist site we must promote. It is not for tourism 
only because I know that China needs coconuts. Their coconut 
factories are extremely successful. They are selling coconut 
milk all over the world but they need 300 million coconuts every 
year. Their Hainan island can produce only 100 million coconuts 
and they have to import 200 million from Vietnam. I came here 
to see whether Kampot Province could sell coconuts to China. 
[applause] 
  I would like to inform you that Thailand is very successful 
in raising shrimp for export. I came here also to see whether 
we can be like the Thais. If they can do it, we can do it. 
There should not be much difference between us. Thank you.

<F P=106> [Article by Nate Thayer: "New Banking, Forex and Investment </F>
Laws by '94"] 
  [Text] The promise by Cambodia's new government to 
fundamentally transform the economy is sending shudders through 
the investment community. Some contracts with foreign investors 
signed with the previous administration are likely to be 
canceled amid charges that the government is motivated by 
political revenge. 
  Senior government officials are embarking on a sound policy 
to eliminate the remnants of Cambodia's previously-centralized 
economy, analysts say, after a new leadership trained in the 
West has taken control of virtually all key financial and 
economic portfolios in recent weeks. The new government, 
announced earlier this month, turned over most of the financial 
and economic policy portfolios to the Royalist FUNCINPEC 
[National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, 
and Cooperative Cambodia] party. 
  Many of the new ministers and economic policy advisors 
recently returned from exile in France, and have vowed to begin 
an aggressive campaign to restructure Cambodia's tax, 
investment, banking, and currency laws. World Bank, IMF, and 
ADB officials are currently in Phnom Penh advising the new 
government as it rewrites existing laws. 
  Economy and Finance Minister Sam Rangsi, a French-trained 
economist, told THE POST there would be a new banking act, 
foreign exchange act, and investment law promulgated by January, 
1994. He vowed "the first real budget in 20 years" would be 
submitted by January and that by 1995 a "stringent" budget, in 
line with IMF and World Bank austerity programs, would be in 
effect. 
  "We will have institutional reform in order to make the 
government structure match the market economy," Rangsi said on 
Nov. 15. But he warned that some contracts signed by the 
previous government would be abrogated or "revised". 
  "Most of the contracts are acceptable. Some may need 
amendments to reflect the new situation," Rangsi said. He also 
said a "handful" of contracts will have to be canceled. "But the 
majority of investors do not have to fear." 
  The first victim is widely expected to be the Thai giant 
Chinawat which signed a 99-year agreement to broadcast IBC 
[International Boradcasting Corporation] television with the 
Cambodian People's Party which lost the elections. The station 
went on the air prior to elections and was fined by UNTAC 
[United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia] for 
violating election laws. 
  "They gave full support and propaganda to one political 
faction before the election and were allowed to operate for 99 
years without one Baht -- one dollar -- for Cambodia. We should 
bring things to a normal standard," Rangsi said. 
  He accused some investors of "giving so much money under the 
table to corrupt officials" in previous months with no benefit 
to Cambodia. 
  The government signed an agreement with Singapore 
International Airlines (SIA) last week to create a new national 
carrier. The deal, which gives 40 percent to SIA, 30 percent to 
the government and 30 percent to local private investors, 
effectively abrogates several other contracts signed between the 
previous government and private investors. 
  Rangsi attacked the level of official corruption and called 
for centralized economic policy-making and "transparent 
political power" to root out corruption. 
  "There should be incompatibility between the status of 
minister and that of shareholder of a private company," he said. 
"Either ministers defend private interests or the national 
interest." 
  He accused government official of receiving "free shares 
when 
some private companies were created by very questionable 
interests". 
  "They should resign from government," he said. "This is the 
kind of transparency we want to implement." 
  The government has also begun an attempt to strengthen the 
Riel. 
  "We want to rely on sound macro-economic policy to restore 
confidence in our currency by strengthening its value both 
domestically and internationally," said Chulong Somura, vice 
president of the Central Bank. 
  Cambodia has seen four straight months of negative inflation 
for the first time in several years. It reintroduced the 50 
Riel note earlier this month which had been dropped as worthless 
last year in the wake of triple digit inflation. 
  The aim, according to Chulong, is to "decrease the 
dollarization, the use of foreign currency". She said the 
government would "drop two zero's" from the new currency to be 
issued next year. The Riel strengthened 20 percent against the 
dollar last week in the wake of the formation of the new 
government, but Rangsi said they will attempt to stabilize the 
Riel between 2,400 and 2,600 to the dollar. 
  "There is a squeeze in liquidity because we have not printed 
money in more than one year, but we will not increase the money 
supply," he said. 
  Rangsi said the investment and economic restructuring 
programs are linked to the political developments in the country. 
  "Security and Khmer Rouge issues are both key investment 
issues... eventually the best weapon against the Khmer Rouge is 
economic development and rural development. 
  "We don't want to make war again against the Khmer Rouge. If 
we can reduce the imbalance between the rich and poor, the urban 
and farmers, reduce corruption, reduce social injustice, this is 
the basis of our new policy, we believe then the Khmer Rouge 
will disappear," he said. 
  Rangsi said the new banking legislation will be aimed at 
weeding out dubious banks that have opened in Cambodia since 
private banks were first allowed to operate here in 1991. 
  He acknowledged the authorities were aware of Cambodia 
emerging as a significant heroin trans-shipment route. 
  "We are aware of this. There are banks operating with zero 
capital, no customers, and run by people with no qualifications, 
people who have nothing to do with the banking industry and are 
laundering money and covering up other illicit activities. We 
have to react quickly," he said. 
  Cambodia currently only requires five million dollars in 
capital to open a bank "but even that is only theoretical," said 
the Finance Minister.

<F P=106> ["Clarification of the Thai Boon Rong Company to Mr. Sam </F>
Rangsi" issued in Phnom Penh on 14 January] 
  [Text] I, chairman of the Thai Boon Rong Company, would 
like to inform Mr. Sam Rangsi of the following: 
  In the remarks you made on 11 January you should have first 
selected only words of truth before you uttered them because you 
were speaking in the name of the government. What you said 
conveyed the feeling that you alone were patriotic while all 
others were the scourge of the nation. Or was it not so? 
  Each statement you made concerned the fault of the former 
government, of former state officials. To hear you speak, 
everybody else was always wrong; no one was right. I would like 
to tell you that without the former government, "which you said 
to be faulty," maybe you would not at all be able to show your 
face in Cambodia and step on Cambodian soil as you are now. 
  You are a politician. You should know how to "think ahead 
and in reverse" and to speak with realism. You should not 
babble like a half-wit. If you find that a person is in the 
wrong, you have the right to remove, reprove, fine, or sue him; 
but you have no right to revile anybody at all. However, you 
are not afraid even to malign the former government with which 
you are currently in cooperation. By the way, what proof do you 
have to gamely accuse over the public address system that the 
previous government had driven vendors out of the Olympic market 
at gunpoint? Does it really happen that way? Or is it merely an 
attempt to cause division in the Royal Government? 
  I am glad to hear your remarks, which gave credits to our 
company, but you should first closely examine them. My company 
is always prepared to let you personally inspect its books, 
because if you send somebody else to do it, that "somebody" may 
not correctly inspect them as you wish, may not be as patriotic 
as you are. 
  Regarding to remarks that "the Thai Boon Rong Company has 
made a $30-million profit," I invite you to come in person to 
ticket me for a fine or to levy taxes on my company. If you 
appoint somebody else in your place, he may cause the nation to 
incur some losses. 
  Do you want to solve problems, or do you want to create them 
in the Kingdom of Cambodia and in the Royal Government? If you 
want to solve problems, you are asked to be less liberal with 
your utterances. Before opening your mouth, you should wag your 
tongue a million times. 
  After you have read this clarification, you should keep 
forever in mind that my company is run by humans who also know 
what is right and what is wrong, just like yourself. You are 
not the only one who knows and certainly not the only one who 
can solve all these problems. 
  Please hurry up; do not any waste time. My company's door is 
always open for you to come in to inspect it and levy taxes. 
  You likened investors to leeches sucking the blood and sweat 
of the people. This kind of talk is inflamatory and divisive. 
They are not words of the new year, the year of national 
reconstruction and national reconciliation. Such an attitude 
and such remarks certainly threaten investors and frighten them 
in their businesses that would contribute to the rehabilitation 
of the national economy. Therefore, it is more appropriate for 
you to be given the title of "Minister of Economic and Financial 
Destruction." 
  So, Mr. Sam Rangsi, please come and inspect my company. If 
after you have inspected it and nothing is found to be as in 
your allegations, will you be game enough to play out your 
"patriotic" role? 
  As far as my company is concerned, it is waiting for you to 
come and inspect it. If you find that my company has evaded 
taxes or has imported materials for the construction of that 
market more than necessary, I and my company will pay all the 
taxes and accept all kinds of fines. 
  If you fail to find fault with my company, what will you do? 
You are asked to clarify this issue and to make a firm 
commitment. 
  Mr. Sam Rangsi, please accept our clarification as 
appropriate. 
  Phnom Penh, 14 January 1994 
  Thank you, 
  Theng Bun Ma

<F P=106> [Reply from Sam Rangsi, state minister and minister of </F>
economy and finance of the Royal Government of Cambodia, to 
Theng Bun Ma, chairman of the Thai Boon Rong Company; issued in 
Phnom Penh on 17 January] 
  [Text] I, Sam Rangsi, would like to inform Theng Bun Ma, 
chairman of the Thai Boon Rong Company 
  I have read the "clarification" that you had your paper 
REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA publish in the issue No. 238 dated 16 January 
1994. I would like to comment only on the following points: 
  1. In all my statements, I have never put the blame fully on 
"former state officials" and said that "everybody else was 
always wrong; no one was right" as you wrote. You have made 
these statements up entirely because I clearly understand that 
among the previous and current administrators there are good and 
bad persons. I have a large number of colleagues in whom I fully 
have consideration and trust; all of them served the nation in 
the previous administration of the "State of Cambodia." 
  2. The luck I have to "step on Cambodian soil" again did not 
come from the deed of the "former government" as you said; it 
was due to the clear-sighted national reconciliation initiative 
of His Majesty [H.M.] the King, combined with the struggle of an 
overwhelming number of nationalists inside and outside the 
country, and because of the will of the entire Cambodian people 
who have voted for a change of regime in the country in May 
1993. Despite this, I am a genuine Cambodian, born in Cambodia 
of Cambodian parents and as such I have the right to come back 
and live in my ancestors' land. 
  3. I would like to thank you for clearly showing your 
conscience and the degree of your cultural knowledge in accusing 
me of being a person who does not know how to "think ahead and 
in reverse" and for being a "half-wit." Furthermore, you called 
me "minister of economic and financial destruction." 
  I would like to inform you that: 
  -- The positions and honors that I have received so far came 
from H.M. the King and from the confidence in me of the 
Cambodian people who are Cambodia's sole owners. 
  -- Recently, I was appointed by H.M. the King, with the 
consent of all political parties, member of Cambodia's Supreme 
National Council which represents Cambodia's sovereignty. 
  -- Furthermore, I was elected people's representative in 
Siem Reap constituency. 
  -- Lastly, I have been appointed by H.M. the King state 
minister and minister of economy and finance in the royal 
government that was set up in accordance with a royal decree 
dated 1 November 1993. 
  -- You can despise me, but you should not express this 
through the use of improper words against the king and the 
Cambodian people who have made their judgment, selected, and 
appointed me to my current position. Therefore, according to 
what you said, this means that in your opinion the king of 
Cambodia and the Cambodian people lack correct judgment in 
electing their representatives and leaders. It also means that 
only Theng Bun Ma knows how to assess the qualities of the 
country's leaders. 
  -- Perhaps the fact that you do not have Cambodian blood 
explains why you do not know how to respect Cambodia's king, 
people, and customs. 
  4. You wrote that I "malign the former government" with 
which I am "currently in cooperation" and that I want to "cause 
division in the Royal Government." Who appointed you lawyer of 
the "former government"? What right do you have to appoint 
yourself spokesman of the new government? Let the people judge 
your character as "lawyer" and "spokesman." 
  5. I would like to thank your company for allowing me and 
for being "always prepared" to let me "inspect its books." 
Regardless of this, in my position as the one responsible for 
managing the national economy, particularly in the fields of 
taxes and customs duties, I have full right to inspect all 
companies that I suspect or about which I have sufficient 
evidence that these companies have not correctly abided by the 
law. 
  I have the honor to inform you that your company is among 
the 
above category of companies that are improper or would-be 
improper. Therefore, I will send a number of economic and 
financial officials to check your company in the near future. 
  6. Concerning the economy and investment, I have lived and 
studied and have been an investor myself for a fair number of 
years in liberal and developed countries in which there are 
proper laws and good order, which is an important factor 
enabling their economies to develop. 
  It is my view that such conditions do not yet exist in 
Cambodia. This has led to the fact that a number of 
"investments" made in the past three or four years have not 
really promoted Cambodia's economy and society toward genuine 
progress. On the contrary, a number of illegal "investments," 
not in conformity with the nation's interest and with the 
people's will, have created a troubled atmosphere, corruption, 
embezzlement, and injustice toward a large number of poor and 
innocent people. 
  In my view, as long as Cambodia does not have proper law 
and order and a number of leaders still do as they please, 
Cambodia cannot attract proper investors with good conduct to 
contribute to the country's progress in the long run. On the 
contrary, in the troubled atmosphere that has prevailed over the 
past three or four years, a large number of "investors" doing 
business in Cambodia tended to be bad foreigners who came to rob 
or destroy property and interests to pilfer and to serve their 
own interests with the support of some corrupt leaders as their 
partners. 
  This type of investor and bad businessman has infiltrated 
and 
taken over many exclusive rights in the national economy. 
Investors and proper and legal businessmen (those who have paid 
taxes and customs duties and who refused or did not know how to 
bribe) cannot do business to compete with the bad guys. So, as 
long as I am in the current position, I will do my best to 
enable the country to have proper law and to get everyone, be 
they small or big, poor or rich, to abide by law and to respect 
national interest. Only in such condition can Cambodia attract 
good investors to do business in the country to make the 
national economy genuinely prosper and at the same time raise 
social justice. I am convinced that before too long good and 
law-abiding investors with respect for Cambodian interest and 
customs and traditions will replace bad investors, the ones we 
have so far encountered. 
  In economic science, there is a law, which in English is 
called The Gresham Law [preceding three words in English], 
saying that "The bad money drives out the good." [preceding 
sentence in English] It means that "spoiled bank notes drive 
out the good ones from the market." This is the same in 
business in general. In other words, in a troubled atmosphere 
bad investors and traders drive out good investors and proper 
traders from the market. 
  However, with all nationalists, I will strive to do my best 
to reverse this tragic and unjust current soon, namely to 
attract and encourage world-renowed investors with formidable 
means who are willing to abide by law and respect the nation's 
interest, to replace and drive out bad investors from the 
Cambodian market "The good investors will drive out the bad." 
[preceding sentence in in English] 
  7. After the election, the Cambodian people in general, like 
myself, rejoiced because we had put an and to a heavy foreign 
colonial yoke. However, the Cambodian people, like myself, have 
suffered and realized that our country is under the colonial 
economic yoke of the "Thai Boon Rong" company with a number of 
foreign criminal traders (mafia) [preceding word in English] 
behind it. Everyone knows that the "Thai Boon Rong" company is 
the real manager of our national economy because it has immense 
resources acquired through the Cambodian people's sweat and 
blood. It has used dollars to buy the conscience of some of our 
national leaders, enabling it to do as it pleases. We cannot 
count the number of plots of land, buildings, factories, houses, 
farms, forest, coastal stretches that Theng Bun Ma has embezzled 
and made his own with the collusion of a small number of old 
leaders who were corrupt and who have sold off the nation. 
Earlier, the question we should have asked those around us was: 
"What does Thai Boon Rong own?" because of Thai Boon Rong's 
already extensive ownership. Now the question we should ask is 
this: "What does not belong to Thai Boon Rong?" This is because 
almost the whole of our Cambodia in under Thai Boon Rong's 
influence. 
  8. I still remember that at the end of December 1991 
following a brutal repression of students who demonstrated 
against corruption, I dared to openly and officially express my 
support for nationalists who dared to stage demonstrations 
against the old government for which Theng Bun Ma is now acting 
as "lawyer." 
  My statement and message of support for compatriot 
demonstrators at that time was carried by a number of 
international newspapers worldwide. Now I have no fear 
whatsoever in expressing my nationalist sentiments which have 
forced me to expose and heavily stress on the colonial economy 
Thai Boon Rong is practicing in my revered motherland. 
  Until the last drop of my blood I will show that I remain 
loyal always to the nation, religion, and the king. Phnom Penh 
17 January 1994 Sam Rangsi

  [Text] The puppets of the Vietnamese communists gathered 
their troops from here and there, along with the troops left 
over along National Route 6 in Siem Reap Province, and deployed 
them at Spean Koul Village, Krapoe Commune on the border of 
Stoung District in Kompong Thom Province and Chikreng District 
in Siem Reap Province from 15 to 18 January. 
  The attacking troops of the Vietnamese communists' puppets 
started their drive against the people and Democratic Kampuchea 
on 19 January. However, the people -- who are boiling with rage 
against the Vietnamese communists and have been robbed and 
ruined by these bandits -- joined the National Army of 
Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] and closely collaborated with the 
latter in the counterattackg to protect the people's property 
and lives. 
  At that time, a number of soldiers of the Vietnamese 
communists' puppets and of the Paras [troops of the Khmer 
People's National Liberation Front] -- who have deserted to live 
with their parents and due to their anger, lack of money, and 
hunger because their salary was robbed from them by their 
superiors -- joined the NADK and the people and chased away and 
swept the attacking troops of Vietnam's puppets along Route 6 in 
Siem Reap Province. 
  One part of the force chased the attacking troops from Spean 
Koul to Pralay and Stoung. Another part of the force swept the 
enemy from Spean Koul, Lveng Russei, to Kompong Kdei. The 
attacking troops of the Vietnamese communists' puppets were 
routed; many were killed or wounded by mines, booby traps, and 
other [words indistinct]. 
  This is a counter attack to protect the property and lives 
of 
the people, who have been constant victims of the enemy's 
plunder, burning, and oppression for the past more than 15 
years. This clearly shows that the Cambodian nation and people 
will not let troops of the Vietnamese communists' puppets do 
what they want at will. People have to fight to defend their 
villages, property, and lives. They want peace and national 
reconciliation instead of fighting for the Vietnamese communists 
and Western powers. 
  If these soldiers' leaders want to remain servants of the 
Vietnamese communists and the Western powers in order to have 
rank, honors, and money, let them fight themselves.

  [Text] The puppets of the Vietnamese communists and the 
two-headed government have ordered their forces to move from the 
west and east of Route 68. The forces are comprised of military 
trucks, artillery pieces, and infantry troops in an attempt to 
drive toward the liberated zones of Democratic Kampuchea. On 17 
January, the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea and the 
people attacked and destroyed these attacking forces at Pongro 
and Ta Pen along Route 68 below Samraong. Over 20 soldiers were 
killed and a number of others wounded. The remaining troops 
fled the battlefield and returned to their villages because the 
majority of the puppet soldiers were forcibly drafted from 
villages where people were harvesting crops.

  [Text] Between 17 and 18 January, the warmongering 
communist Vietnamese puppets gathered 1,000 puppet soldiers from 
the 196th, 12th, and 6th Divisions; from Battambang District; 
and from provincial troops and attacked the people's liberated 
villages in the area of Boeng Kandal and Dambok villages on the 
south Sisophon battlefield. 
  The people and the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea 
[NADK], however, clearly had advance warning of the enemy's 
attack plan and ambushed the enemy forces. The NADK, in 
cooperation with the people, divided their forces into two 
prongs. The first prong attacked the communist Vietnamese 
puppet troops as they left Lvea village; the second prong 
attacked the troops leaving Ampil Pram Daeum. In these two 
attacks, the NADK and the people killed 38 communist Vietnamese 
puppet soldiers, wounded 32 others, and seized a large quantity 
of guns and materiel. The remaining soldiers were really 
scared. A large number fled because they were afraid of dying 
and were angry with their commanders for forcing them to attack 
the Democratic Kampuchean resistance forces and the people and 
die on their behalf.

  [Text] Between 20, 21, and 22 January 1994, leaders of the 
communist Vietnamese's puppets gathered 200 puppet soldiers of 
the communist Vietnamese from Division 7, which is in charge of 
defending Phnom Penh. Among the 200 soldiers were 80 Vietnamese 
who acted as the spearhead. These 80 men are Cambodian-speaking 
Vietnamese; some talk in Cambodian with an accent when 
communicating with their colleagues on the battlefield. These 
200 form the core of the troops in other divisions who have been 
beaten, killed, or wounded on Route 68 east of Samraong and west 
of Samraong battlefields, such as Division 11, 9, 3, the new 
Division 7, and units from the 4th Military Region. All these 
troops are under the command of Ke Kimyan, Pol Saroeun, Long 
Sopheap, Eng Sopheap, and a dozen other, so-called generals. 
  However, once again the National Army of Democratic 
Kampuchea, in cooperation with the people, have smashed their 
offensive. In particular on 20 January, our national army 
scored a direct hit against the frontline command post of the 
communist Vietnamese's puppets with Long Sopheap and Prum Samen 
as commanding generals. We killed 47 communist Vietnamese 
puppets, whose bodies were left on the spot, and wounded some 
others. We destroyed four armored vehicles, three tanks, six 
military trucks, and a large quantity of military materiel. 
  Among those killed or wounded were Prum Samen, some 
generals, 
and many colonels and majors who were meeting and drinking 
alcohol. Now Long Sopheap's position is being surrounded and 
attacked by us; he is looking for a way to escape. The 
remaining soldiers have been routed and have fled to the west of 
Route 69. 
  In three days -- 20, 21, and 22 January -- troops of the 
communist Vietnamese panicked and fled in units, in groups of 10 
or 20 at a time, four or five groups a day. Only the special 
units composed of Vietnamese soldiers speaking Cambodian with an 
accent remain. Fifty percent of these special units have been 
killed or wounded; they are either being killed or wounded, or 
they are fleeing. These fleeing soldiers say that they are not 
staying to fight; they are afraid of death because this is a 
place of death. If the commanders want to fight, let them do the 
fighting themselves.

  [Text] The two-headed government has recently promulgated a 
law saying foreigners can stay without a passport in Cambodia 
for one or two weeks. The so-called new law made the Vietnamese 
cheer loudly since this is what they long for. The significance 
of the law is exactly the same as the content of the nonborder 
treaty previously concluded between the Vietnamese communists 
and their puppets. Are the puppets so stupid? No, they are 
not. The Vietnamese communists have ordered them to act like 
this since they exert 100 percent control over military, 
civilian, and other affairs in the rural areas and 99 percent in 
Phnom Penh. As for other people, they are waiting only to 
repeat clamorously what the Vietnamese communists and their 
puppets have said. 
  Another concrete example is that when the people support and 
demand that the five-point initiative offered by the king be 
implemented to achieve national reconciliation and restore 
peace, the Vietnamese communists and their puppets talk about 
only three points; those in the Vietnamese communists' cage also 
repeat the three points. 
  This action will destroy the nation and people and make the 
Cambodian race and territory disappear as was the case of 
Kampuchea Kraom. 
  The people say they do not want the two-headed government 
because it is under the total control of the Vietnamese 
communists and their puppets. Only by supporting the five 
points of the king can the Cambodian nation, people, and race be 
safeguarded forever.

  [Text] Jakarta, Jan 22 (ANTARA) -- President Suharto has 
again said that the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
forum should remain flexible and unstructured. 
  After paying a courtesy visit to President Suharto here over 
the week end, visiting Malaysian Minister for International 
Trade and Industry Affairs Rafidah Aziz said that such a 
flexible forum is needed on the grounds that economic 
capabilities of the members of APEC are not uniform but varying. 
  She quoted the Indonesian head of state as saying that some 
of APEC members have high economic acceleration, some are 
moderate, and some others are even still developing. 
  APEC groups ASEAN countries, the US, Canada, China, Taiwan, 
Hongkong, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Australia, Papua New 
Guinea, and Mexico. The forum is scheduled to have its annual 
economic leaders informal summit in Jakarta in November, 1994. 
APEC is chaired by Indonesia. 
  "It would be possible to discuss a possibility of having a 
free trade area if other APEC members like ASEAN countries have 
achieved an advanced economic progress," Minister Rafidah Aziz 
said. 
  She said that the possibility of the presence of Malaysia's 
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed at the forthcoming informal APEC 
summit in Jakarta was not discussed with the head of state. 
  On Friday (21/1) the minister had assured the press of the 
presence of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed at the APEC economic 
leaders informal summit. 
  Prime Minister Mahathir did not attend the attend the first 
APEC summit held in the US city of Seattle last year. On trade 
cooperation amomg ASEAN countries, she said that Indonesia, 
Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia and the Philippines are now working 
on the establishment of trade cooperation. 
  Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand has established the 
Singapore-Johor-Riau (Sijori) growth triangle. 
  At the meeting, the head of state briefed the visiting 
Malaysian Minister about the Indonesian companies' capability in 
developing the liquified natural gas (LNG) train in Bontang. 
  The development of such an LNG train was used to be 
conducted 
by foreign companies. 
  Commenting on the head of state's explanation, Minister 
Rafidah Aziz said that Malaysia, who also has the similar LNG 
train, wishes to cooperate with Indonesia in taking bids of LNG 
train developments in other countries such as in China, and 
Vietnam.

  [Text] Jakarta, Jan. 22 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia and 
Indonesia Saturday signed an investment guarantee agreement 
[IGA] to encourage the private sectors of both countries to 
optimise the huge potential available in economic and industrial 
cooperation. 
  The agreement on promotion and protection of investments was 
signed by Malaysian Minister of International Trade and Industry 
Rafidah Aziz and Indonesian Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Susilo Sudarman, who is defence and security minister. 
  Speaking to reporters after the signing ceremony, Rafidah 
urged the Malaysian and Indonesian private sectors to follow up 
with joint ventures to exploit the vast economic opportunities 
available in the two countries. 
  Rafidah, who is here for a two-day visit, also called on 
entrepreneurs of the two countries to synergise their capacity 
to invest in third countries which are opening up their 
economies like Cambodia, Vietnam, and the People's Republic of 
China. 
  She said they had developed the capacity in fields like 
electronics, oil, and gas engineering and by combining their 
resources they could strongly bid for tenders in third countries. 
  Susilo, describing the agreement as timely, said the 
Indonesian Government was looking forward to more joint ventures 
between Indonesian and Malaysian businessmen, especially with 
the implementation of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA). 
  Rafidah said ASEAN had already signed an umbrella IGA in 
1987, but this bilateral agreement showed that the two 
governments were serious in forging greater cooperation between 
their private sectors. 
  She said trade between the two countries and the awareness 
of 
trade opportunities among their businessmen in both countries 
were increasing, but they should be more aggressive as the trade 
base was still small in proportion to the potentials. 
  Total trade between the two countries had increased from 
U.S. 
$199 million worth in 1985 to U.S. $1.139 billion in 1992, but 
it only accounted for 1.4 percent of Malaysia's total global 
trade, she added. 
  Indonesia's investment in Malaysia up to December 1992 stood 
at U.S. $1.28 billion, but out of 800 investment projects 
approved last year, only three were Indonesian. 
  Malaysia's investment in Indonesia now stood at U.S. $166 
million in 32 projects, mainly in wood industry, food, metal, 
and textiles. 
  Rafidah Friday held talks with Trade Minister Billy Yudono 
on 
bilateral, regional, and global trade matters and with Minister 
of Research and Technology B.J. Habibie on cooperation in 
aerospace industry. 
  Earlier Saturday, she held discussions with Minister of 
Industry Tungky Aribowo on, among others, bilateral trade 
relations and the forthcoming informal meeting of ASEAN economic 
ministers in Kuala Lumpur on April 22.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of interview with State Minister for Investment </F>
Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo by TEMPO correspondent Dwi Setyo Irawanto 
in Jakarta -- date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Irawanto] Could you tell me why there is the 
impression that we seem to adopt a cautious stand toward foreign 
investors? 
  [Sastrowardoyo] We want not only economic growth, but also 
equal income distribution. Foreign investors are allowed to 
benefit from our business opportunities, but we must also defend 
national interests. Foreign investment should not be allowed to 
affect the business of local people, capture our domestic 
market, corner our businessmen, or make our businessmen lose 
business opportunities. I do not want that to happen. At least, 
we must be equal in giving and taking things. 
  [Irawanto] How do you make that happen? 
  [Sastrowardoyo] They are allowed to set up wholly owned 
foreign companies, but they must observe the requirements, 
namely, their capital must be more than U.S. $50 million, their 
company must be located in the approved industrial estate or in 
the 15 designated provinces such as Jambi or the eastern part of 
Indonesia, or they must export all their products overseas. It 
must be borne in mind that foreign investors need to fulfil one 
of the above requirements, and not necessarily all of them. For 
instance, they can still set up wholly-owned foreign companies 
if their capital is under U.S. $50 million, but their company 
must be located in one of the 15 designated provinces, and their 
products must be entirely for export. However, after 20 years, 
they must carry out a divestment program [two preceding words in 
English], which means that 51 percent of the company's equity 
must be sold to local businessmen. 
  [Irawanto] Why? 
  [Sastrowardoyo] Because we do not want passive observers and 
because we also want a piece of the economic cake. We do not 
want to become mere laborers who have given them land, water, 
and opportunities which they have grabbed. 
  [Irawanto] Do you think the requirements are too hard for 
foreign investors? 
  [Sastrowardoyo] No, because the 51-percent equity can still 
be split into smaller portions. For example, 31 percent for 
local partners, while the remaining 20 percent can be listed in 
the stock market. So the 49-percent owner can continue as the 
single majority [two preceding words in English] holder. 
Therefore, foreign investors do not have to worry about it. Do 
not forget that local partners include not only local 
businessmen, but also international financial institutions such 
as the IFC [International Finance Corporation], the IMF, and the 
ADB [Asian Development Bank] which the Indonesian Government is 
a shareholder. The idea is not to allow foreigners to 
completely dominate business opportunities in our country, while 
our people remain mere spectators. 
  [Irawanto] But other countries do not have the divestment 
program. 
  [Sastrowardoyo] We are competing not only with developing 
countries, but also with developed ones. We must be mentally 
ready and skillful in dealing with foreign investors. If 
foreign investors wholly own their companies and we only supply 
them with land, water, and manpower, this country will 
definitely become a nation of laborers. We will never become a 
nation of entrepreneurs [preceding word in English] and we will 
never have management experts. As for other investment areas, I 
think we have already adopted an open-minded approach. [passage 
omitted on the issues of land and bureaucracy] 
  [Irawanto] Do you see the PRC as a threat to our investment 
drive? 
  [Satrowardoyo] I believe the PRC is not a threat because 
political stability is still a big question there while its 
business regulations are inconsistent. Vietanm will probably 
pose a threat to us three years from now. At present, its 
infrastructure and regulations are not ready for investment, but 
if they can cope with these problems, that country will be more 
competitive. But for now, I see no serious threat. 
  [Irawanto] What is Indonesia's position in attracting 
foreign investment? 
  [Sastrowardoyo] We managed to get U.S. $10.3 billion in 
1992, but do not forget that the figure represents overall 
investment, while pure foreign investment stood at about one 
fourth of this amount. As of 11 December 1993, we managed to 
attract U.S. $7.4 billion only. It is true that there is a drop 
in investment in 1993. 
  [Irawanto] What is the greatest obstacle for foreign 
investors? 
  [Sastrowardoyo] Indonesia is the only ASEAN country and the 
only Asian country that does not give tax holidays [two 
preceding words in English], which was abolished on 1 January 
1984. This is because we need all sources of revenue, including 
taxation. On the other hand, people often ask: "Why does 
Indonesia have a divestment program and others not?" The answer 
is, as I have explained earlier, namely, we do not want to 
become mere spectators.

  [Text] Francesco Vendrell, the UN secretary general's 
envoy, says that he now understands conditions in East Timor 
better. He feels that a report to be presented to UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali is complete enough, thanks to 
information provided by Indonesian officials during his 
three-day stay in the territory. Francesco Vendrell expressed 
his views at Dili's Komoro Airport yesterday prior to his 
departure from East Timor. He added that the results of his 
visit to East Timor will serve as input for the tripartite 
Jakarta-Lisbon-UN talks on East Timor scheduled for next May. 
Vendrell described development in East Timor as very advanced 
and positive in promoting the welfare of the local population.

<F P=106> [Article by Mitsuhiro Uezumi, political commentator: "Loud </F>
Laughter of Party Movers To Further Left Heard"] 
  [Text] Tomiichi Murayama has been elected as the new 
chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]. What 
was surprising was that the "views" of both candidates Murayama 
and Ito were drafted by the ultraleft wing. 
  The characteristic of the recent election of the SDPJ 
chairman was the fact that the direction of the executive branch 
shifted from the moderate/ultraleft wing faction of Makoto 
Tanabe (Japan Postal Workers' Union centrist faction), Sadao 
Yamahana (ditto moderate left-wing faction) and Wataru Kubo 
(Nikkyoso [Japan Teachers' Union] moderate right-wing faction) 
to the left-/ultraleft-wing faction, which is backed by the 
Jichiro [All-Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Union]. 
  It means that the struggle between the centrist faction and 
the left-wing faction over the political direction within the 
Kankoro [National Council of Government and Public Workers' 
Unions], which forms the core of the SDPJ-Sohyo [General Council 
of Trade Unions of Japan] alignment, has ended in victory for 
the left-wing faction. 
  Under the Murayama aegis, the SDPJ will ostensibly maintain 
party solidarity while placing itself within the coalition 
government in the area of domestic politics, but in reality will 
shift to control by the left wing. 
  This is illustrated by the withdrawal from the candidacy for 
party chairman by Wataru Kubo, who represents the moderate left 
wing, followed by the candidacy of Masatoshi Ito of the extreme 
left and Tomiichi Murayama of the left wing and also by the 
victory process by Murayama as chairman. In order to quickly 
understand this, let us look at the backgrounds of the 
candidates. 
  Masatoshi Ito (upper house proportional representative, 
elected once) is an anti-U.S. base activist and a member of the 
"National Network To Revitalize the Pro-Constitution SDPJ" [the 
"Network"]. His electorate consists of the Tokenkyo [National 
Liaison Council for the Study of Party Construction], a party 
organization of local activists, and the "Network," an 
extraparty citizens' organization. Both organizations are 
controlled by the party's extreme left-wing faction, which is 
oriented toward a united SDPJ-Communist front and forms the 
Heiwa Senryaku Ken [Peace Strategy Study Group] led by Akira 
Iwai (former Sohyo chairman). 
  The Tokenkyo was formed in late 1980 with the Zenrokyo 
[National Council of Trade Unions]--the national center of the 
ultraleft opposition to the Rengo [National Confederation of 
Trade Unions]--as its base. On 4 Sepember [1993] at the general 
meeting held at the Jichiro Kaikan Building in Tokyo, it 
submitted a request to Sukio Iwatare (affiliated with the Peace 
Strategy Study Group) to run for party chairman, and Torao 
Takasawa and Tetsu Ueda were among those who called for a 
signature movement in support of the request. (If Takasawa had 
won in the previous general election, he probably would have 
been asked to run for chairman.) 
<H5>  Ito Candidacy a Display of Power by the Ultraleft </H5>
  The policies set forth at the general election were as 
follows: 
  1. In order to revitalize the pro-Constitution party, to 
make 
all-out efforts for the victory of a candidate for chairman who 
opposes the continued single-seat constituencies with a 
proportional representation system. 
  2. To reaffirm the importance of preventing a single-seat 
constituency proportional system rather than remain as a 
minister in the Hosokawa cabinet. 
  3. To reaffirm the maintenance of the party's key policies 
concerning the security treaty, the Self-Defense Forces, and 
nuclear power development. To formulate conditions for the 
recovery of Diet seats in order to realize the party's policies 
in the coalition government. 
  4. To create a citizens' movement through the party's 
subsidiary structure and the "Network" toward revitalization of 
the pro-Constitution party. 
  The "Network" may be viewed as a reorganized version of the 
existent "Group To Protect the Constitution" generally known for 
its extreme-left nature and was formed to seek further 
expansion. Although such "lone-wolf politicians" as Shizuo Wada 
(party vice chairman), Tetsu Wada, and Kazuo Saito of the former 
Ota Society and the Labor-Farmer Party make up the core that 
stands out in front, the matrix is formed by the Tokenkyo and 
the Peace Strategy Study Group led by Akira Iwai and Iwatare. In 
the recent election, Tetsu Wada served as Ito's chief secretary 
for election policy. 
  Immediately prior to the 9 September [1993] deadline for 
chairman candidacy, Ito replaced Iwatare as a candidate. Iwatare 
withdrew his candidacy on condition that Murayam accept the 
Tokenkyo's policy. Murayama promised that he will "study it and 
do his best." 
  Ito's purpose was to consolidate the "Network" organization 
through the election, expand it, gather as many votes as 
possible to manifest the power of the "ultraleft" and to apply 
pressure on future party operations. 
  Tomiichi Murayama (lower house, Oita 1st district, seven 
election wins) -- His colorful electorate ranges from the Peace 
Strategy Study Group to the centrist "Social Democratic Forum" 
and a portion of the Suiyokai, in addition to a united 
SDPJ-Communist front-oriented ideological group, the anti-Tanabe 
faction and the anti-single seat constituency faction. 
  The Peace Strategy Study Group consists of members of the 
party secretariat affiliated with the group, centering on Yutaka 
Shitoma, Osamu Yatabe, and Sukio Iwatare. Although it was not 
generally known, they controlled the nuclei of the election 
policy headquarters of both Murayama and Ito and drafted the 
"views" of both candidates. 
<H5>  Secretariat Cold-Shoulders Yamahana </H5>
  Next is the "Society To Promote True Political Reform" 
[Shino 
seiji kaikaku o susumeru kai] ("Promotion Society") formed by 
members of the anti-Tanabe and anti-single seat constituency 
factions. The principal members are: the Suiyokai (Tsuruo 
Yamaguchi, Toshi Oide, and Tadatoshi Akiba); former and present 
members of the Social Democratic Forum (Koken Nosaka, Sekisuke 
Nakanishi, Seiko Kitasawa, Mankichi Kato); the "Creative 
Society" [Tsukuru kai] (Yamahana faction) (Reijiro Sawafuji); 
the former Ishibashi-Hori faction (Hideyuki Maeshima, Masaru 
Hayakawa); and the Sangatsukai "March Society," ultraleft 
faction (Yasuo Yamashita). In particular, Yamashita, former 
secretary to Tetsu Ueda, actively assisted Murayama's 
preparations for the recent election. 
  The "Promotion Society" requested Chairman Yamahana to 1) 
immediately stop corporate contributions, 2) lower party 
subsidies to 250 yen per constituent, and 3) prevent a 
conservative two-party system and maintain the SDPJ's identity 
through a multiparty system. Its strategy was not to display its 
opposition to the single-seat constituency system, but to push 
for "an immediate stop to corporate contributions" and to 
conform with the Communist Party's contentions and 
simultaneously crush the single-seat constituency system. In 
addition to Mankichi Kato who formally switched from the "Social 
Democratic Forum" to the "Promotion Society," the majority in 
the "forum" supported Murayama. It was based mainly on 
anti-Tanabe sentiment. 
  In the "Creative Society" also, half of the Diet members 
including Yuzuru Shimasaki are Murayama supporters. As for the 
party secretariat, the members refused to act in support of 
Yamahana's election even after his announcemnt to run. 
  Backed thus by the the extreme left and left wing as well as 
a portion of the centrist faction, Murayama followers 
constituted a majority, and it turned into a de facto defeat for 
the Tanabe-Yamahana line--i.e. the pro-coalition, 
pro-political-structuring faction. In form, because Murayama 
accepted the coalition administration and upheld the single-seat 
constituency system, Kubo withdraw his candidacy, but the 
reality was quite different. 
  The Murayama clique follows the tradition of the 
Narita-Asukata-Ishibashi-Doi line. In other words, while 
ostensibly setting up a chairman from of an independent 
left-wing faction, in reality the intraparty left wing--in 
particular, the extreme left wing--holds the cards, and is bent 
on "purifying" the SDPJ into a scientific socialist 
(Marxist-Leninist) party. 
<H5>  Rush Toward Obstructing the Coalition Administration </H5>
  The party right wing, including the Zendentsu [All-Japan 
Telecommunications Workers' Union] has already become little 
more than a name since the chairmanship election, while the 
Kankoro moderate right wing centering on Tanabe and the Zentei 
[Japan Postal Workers' Union] is already rapidly weakening. 
  The group's future fate will depend on whether Wataru Kubo 
is 
able at the party convention on 25 Sepember to place Masao 
Sakon, a member of the Suiyokai's right wing and the faction 
behind the coalition administration, to the post of secretary 
general. If he should fail, the SDPJ will eventually rush 
toward opposition against the coalition administration and 
defeat of the single-seat constituency system under a complete 
left-wing leadership, and no one will be able to stop it. 
  In any case, under the Murayama organization, the alienation 
between the SDPJ and the coalition government, and between the 
Rengo, will inevitably widen. Particularly the Rengo's new 
direction, pushed by the eight left-wing independent industrial 
unions, will solidify along the Jinnosuke Ashida (chairman of 
Zensen Domei [Japanese Federation of Textile, Garment, Chemical, 
Distributive &amp; Allied Industry Workers' Unions] and Etsuya 
Washio (chairman of Tekko Roren [Japanese Federation of Iron 
&amp; 
Steel Workers' Unions] line. If present Chairman Yamagishi 
should retire, the trend would further accelerate, and there is 
the danger that, while the Kankoro faction within the Rengo will 
approach closer to the Zenrokyo [National Council of Trade 
Unions], the Rengo mainstream's detachment from politics will 
increase. 
  For the time being, the focus will be on attitude of the 
some 
20 members of the "Promotion Society" and the members of the 
Peace Strategy Study Group regarding the single-seat 
constituency system under the Murayama reign.

<F P=106> [Article by Yoshihisa Inoue, political reporter: "Writer </F>
Critiques Ozawa's Five-Month Performance"] 
  [Text] Immediately following establishment of the Hosokawa 
government, I pointed out in this newspaper that, "Although 
there is criticism of the dual power structure, party leader 
Ichiro Ozawa of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] played the 
foremost role in establishing the coalition government and 
should assume responsibility for the future of the government." 
  However, in reviewing Mr. Ozawa's record for the past five 
months, I must conclude that my expectations were betrayed. I 
cannot help but feel that he emphasized "destruction of the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and assumption of leadership in 
the ruling coalition" rather than "efforts to create a new 
government for the people." 
  I would like to address Mr. Ozawa now with the words, "Do 
not 
take actions that will minimize the importance of politicians, 
but follow the cardinal path for politicians." 
  The Hosokawa government unmistakably portrays the qualities 
of a dual power structure. The "official" leader is Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and, although he has dropped somewhat 
in public opinion polls, he enjoys very high support ratings for 
his cabinet in comparison to those of previous LDP prime 
ministers. The "unofficial" leader, needless to say, is Mr. 
Ozawa. 
  Ever since the establishment of the new government, it has 
been faced with three major policy options. They were the 
revision of and balloting on the draft legislation for the 
political reform laws when they passed the House of 
Representatives without the participation of LDP members, 
opening of the rice markets and compilation of the new fiscal 
year budget after the end of the last calendar year. The 
standard viewpoint now is that the handling of each of the three 
issues was based on concepts advocated by Mr. Ozawa. 
  I see some logic in the handling of the rice issue, but 
question the handling of the other two issues. In order to 
arrange for a compromise with the LDP, there was talk of fixing 
the ceiling for small electoral districts to 280 and a block 
system for the proportional representation districts. However, 
the ruling coalition acceded only to an increase in ceiling for 
small electoral districts from 250 to 270. 
  It appears that the hard-line position taken against the LDP 
involved the sidetracking of efforts by Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura to seek a coordinated position with the LDP 
and inducing a further disintegration of the LDP. 
  I had the same impression even when they pushed through a 
major 45-day extension of the Diet session. Even under 38 years 
of LDP rule, it was rare for the Diet session to be extended for 
the "number of days proposed" by the ruling party. I sensed an 
attempt to worsen the predicament of the LDP. 
  And that was not the sole effect of the extension. 
Realization of the major extension of the Diet session, in 
effect, blocked any potential for retreat on the part of the 
Hosokawa government. If the prime minister who publicly 
committed himself to passage of the political reform laws by the 
end of the last calendar year fails to attain passage during the 
extended Diet session, his only remaining options will be the 
dissolution of the House of Representatives or mass resignation 
of the cabinet. That being the case, the prime minister is being 
treated "no better than a 100-yen disposable cigarette lighter." 
  If the ruling coalition were to seek smooth sailing of Diet 
deliberations concerning political reform, it should have sought 
a compromise with the LDP about extension of the Diet session. 
They should have also given the prime minister an escape route 
from the pending situation. 
  I also have difficulty in seeing any logic behind the 
compilation of the budget after the calendar year end. Mr. 
Ozawa, who served as deputy chief cabinet secretary in the 
Takeshita cabinet and in the important post of LDP secretary 
general in the Kaifu government should have realized the ill 
effects of not compiling the budget by the end of the last 
calendar year in these recessionary times. 
  Mr. Ozawa might refute these statements in this manner, "I 
am 
fully aware of those facts. This is a case where both the ruling 
coalition and the Hosokawa government are taking a stand with 
their backs against the wall. Moreover, political reform 
represents the `plan of the century' for Japanese politics." 
  However, I do not agree with such a position. The ruling 
party has the obligation to constantly determine the majority 
desire of the general public and to strive for realization of 
those desires. If one were to weigh the significance of 
political reform and relief from the current serious 
recessionary situation, it should be obvious as to which should 
be given priority. 
  Any conclusion to the above comparison should be 
self-evident 
if one would only weigh the ill effects on the welfare of the 
general public between a one-month delay in implementing 
procedures for economic recovery versus a similar delay in the 
passage of the political reform laws. Any failure with respect 
to action on the economic front will only serve to worsen the 
prime minister's position. 
  I have other reasons for being unhappy with Mr. Ozawa. The 
issue pertains to the general contractor situation. Why is it 
that he hesitates to take the initiative in testifying before 
the Diet? Although Mr. Ozawa emphasized in comments before a 
press conference on 8 November 1993 about a 5 million yen 
contribution from Kajima that "the contribution has been 
properly accounted for under the Political Funds Control Law," 
he did not clarify which political funding organization received 
the contribution. He has thus failed to give enough 
clarification to dispel any suspicion about the donation. 
  His position on the issue is clearly inconsistent with a 
book 
authored by him which reads, "We must publicly divulge every yen 
of receipts and disbursements concerning political funds and 
provide complete transparency concerning the flow of such funds." 
  Initially, the Social Democratic Party of Japan launched a 
move to summon Mr. Ozawa to testify as a witness in the matter, 
but withdrew the demand based on opposition from within the 
ruling coalition. This situation disqualifies the ruling 
coalition from speaking of political reform and reflects a 
failure to recognize the gravity of the problem. 
  I will express one more grievance. The incident arising from 
the barring of NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN and SANGYO KEIZAI SHIMBUN 
reporters from press conferences reflected a high degree of 
immaturity by Mr. Ozawa. I couldn't believe my ears when he 
said, "Press conferences are conducted as a matter of service 
and are not obligatory." I would like to see Mr. Ozawa conduct 
himself so that he does not "belittle himself." 
  In observing Mr. Ozawa in the past several years, I get the 
"impression that he constantly seeks the shortest possible route 
to achieve his goals." I do not insist that his approach is 
wrong, but the resistance posed is occasionally so overwhelming 
that he is forced to take a "circuitous route." Attempting to 
force his way around probably finds him short of resources to 
attain his ultimate goal. 
  It is definitely a case where the prime minister 
demonstrates 
performance that is no more than that of an amateur and it is 
probably no easy task to manage an eight-party 
wooden-mosaic-like ruling coalition. But, Mr. Ozawa must have 
formed the Hosokawa government well aware of such limitations. 
  At the Shinseito general meeting of members of both houses 
on 
4 January, Mr. Ozawa announced, "I hope to serve the coalition 
in the new year without being as self-centered as I was during 
the last year." I would like to see him use the new year as an 
occasion to deal with Japanese politics in a transitory stage 
with renewed resolve from the vantage point of a national leader.

<F P=106> [First installment of an interview with Nobuo Ishihara, </F>
deputy chief cabinet secretary, by local correspondent Yutaka 
Asahina; place and date not given; first paragraph is MAINICHI 
SHIMBUN introduction] 
  [Text] With the collapse of the "1955 structure", the 
bureaucrats of Kasumigaseki [a district in Tokyo where various 
government offices are located] who had been leading postwar 
Japan, working closely with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], 
are also facing "change". Nobuo Ishihara, deputy chief cabinet 
secretary (in charge of administrative affairs), who stands at 
the top of the bureaucracy, remained in office through the 
change in political regimes and has supported the prime 
minister's office during the turbulent year. While, on one 
hand, the bureaucrats' leadership is supposed to have been 
strengthened under the new government, they feel they are facing 
a serious situation where Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] 
Representative Secretary Ichiro Ozawa proposed his plan to 
revise the National Diet Law, and the Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry was shaken by the personnel change taking 
place. I interviewed the deputy chief cabinet secretary to look 
back at the year 1993, and to let him talk about the politics, 
the bureaucrats, and the tasks of Kasumigaseki [the 
bureaucracy]. (Note: At the conference of the coalition parties' 
representatives held on 12 October, Ozawa proposed his 
"fundamental plan to revise the National Diet Law" as follows: 
(1) The present system under which the bureaucrats are required 
to make explanations at the Diet on behalf of the government 
shall be abolished and politicians will make the explanations; 
(2) Two or three parliamentary vice ministers shall be assigned 
to each ministry as vice ministers and; (3) several Diet members 
shall be assigned to each ministry as parliamentary councilors. 
Repulsion against this plan spread among the bureaucrats as it 
means that the initiative in making policies is to be 
transferred from bureaucrats to politicians). 
  [Asahina] What is your impression, as an insider, about the 
change in political regime? 
  [Ishihara] Personally, I felt I should resign, but I was 
strongly requested [to remain in the post] by Prime Minister 
(Morihiro) Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary (Masayoshi) 
Takemura who are intimate friends of mine. As I felt it was a 
civil servant's duty to help the new government make a smooth 
start, I decided, after consulting with (Kiichi) Miyazawa, then 
prime minister, and (Masaharu) Gotoda, then vice prime minister, 
to stay. I think I should hand over my post to someone after the 
new government makes steady headway. An adequate time for me to 
resign may be when the political reform bills are approved. 
While there is a saying that a samurai is not supposed to serve 
two lords, I have served five lords. This is a rather 
exceptional case, and my philosophy as a government official 
makes me feel very uncomfortable. Fortunately, however, there 
was not much difference in the key policies of the new 
government as it succeeded the fundamental national policies 
without modification, and my conscience did not feel much guilt. 
  [Asahina] Can the same thing be said about the rice issue? 
  [Ishihara] I think the decision would have been almost the 
same no matter who was prime minister. It would have been 
impossible for our country alone to indignantly leave the 
conference. The situation was literally the same when Japan 
withdrew from the League of Nations in the past. We are not 
allowed to withdraw from international cooperation. 
  [Asahina] What about the policymaking procedures? 
  [Ishihara] There has been considerable change in that 
respect. Under the LDP government, the party decided key 
policies, which, in most cases, were accepted by the government. 
Under the new government, it seems that policies are being made 
with both sides acting on equal grounds, or, through 
consultation between the coalition parties and the government. 
  [Asahina] Is such a procedure creating a bureaucrat-dominant 
structure? 
  [Ishihara] It is true that each ministry is beginning to 
gain confidence. They try to frame a policy with the 
responsibility of presenting it to the coalition parties for 
discussion, and, as a general trend, the policy adopted 
considerably reflects the original idea. 
  [Asahina] What about intervention by the Zoku-giin [Diet 
members having strong influence on particular ministries and 
agencies]? 
  [Ishihara] It has decreased. While government officials are 
transferred in two or three years, Zoku-giin remain in their 
post for many years and, therefore, are very familiar with the 
internal affairs of the particular ministries. Though their 
existence has its merits, it also has its demerits, as it tends 
to create collusive relations with business circles. 
  [Asahina] Is there no resistance to the deregulation 
proposed by the Hosokawa government? 
  [Ishihara] Although I do not think the proposal is really 
welcomed by all ministries and agencies, they have become very 
cooperative. When I asked all the ministries and agencies to 
report the items to be removed, I was thinking there would be 
about 20 or 30 items at best. However, they have come up with 
as many as 94 items. Very drastic deregulations were also 
included in the reports. In the past, even if we tried to 
persuade government officials, they were unable to persuade the 
Zoku-giin and, in many cases, they used to refuse the proposal 
saying: "The party will not approve." The atmosphere has 
changed to some extent. 
  [Asahina] How about decentralization? 
  [Ishihara] The prime minister and the chief cabinet 
secretary are totally in favor of decentralization. Ozawa is 
also in favor of decentralization. Although each ministry has 
its own opinion concerning the individual proposals, and while 
certain ministries directly opposed decentralization for the 
reason that "even if the authority is transferred to local 
governments, they are not able to fully exercise it", they 
recently tend to refrain from expressing their opposition. It 
seems that the necessary conditions to rapidly accelerate 
decentralization in the future are being prepared. 
  [Asahina] What is your opinion on Ozawa's plan? 
  [Ishihara] Ozawa's plan is creating serious shock and 
anxiety among all the ministries and agencies. Leading 
officials, in particular, are taking the plan seriously. It is 
an established procedure that Diet members hold discussions at 
the national Diet, and not government officials. However, the 
leading officials are afraid that if politicians are assigned to 
the respective bureaus of the ministries and agencies to take 
part in framing policies as parliamentary councilors, the 
administration's neutrality might be hurt since making policy 
and executing policy are like two sides of a coin. 
  [Asahina] Is that all? 
  [Ishihara] Elite bureaucrats devote their every spare moment 
working for low pay because they find their lives worth living 
in that they can realize their ideals by consistently playing a 
role from the time they frame the policies until they are put 
into practice. They are afraid that, under the Ozawa plan, the 
officials may be degraded as subordinate workers. As we see in 
the case of the United States, the officials of bureau 
director-class and above have to leave their posts when the 
President leaves his office and, therefore, they can not take 
part in making important policies. Under such circumstances, it 
is not possible to secure capable persons. In the United 
States, all the important posts such as bureau directors are 
being occupied by lawyers and other persons. All the ministries 
are feeling serious anxiety over the possibility that the most 
important portion of the administrative work, which, in Japan, 
is being performed by the bureaucrats as lifetime work, might be 
transferred to politicians. 
<H3>  It Is Difficult To Comment on the "Controversial Personnel 
Affair" in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry </H3>
  [Asahina] Is it not considered democratic for politicians 
elected by the people to have more power than officials? 
  [Ishihara] In the prewar days when party politics were 
flourishing with Minseito and Seiyukai competing with one 
another for political power, it was said that even the chief of 
a police station was transferred when a political regime 
changed. After the war, as it is impossible for government 
workers to devote themselves without anxiety, to their duties 
under such a system, the existing public service system was 
established. In both a good and bad sense, a proper order in 
the respective ministries and agencies has been established. 
Persons who are capable of performing their duties efficiently, 
and who are good at managing their followers, are expected to 
become leading officials in due course. Certain officials are 
afraid that the most important portion of the existing system as 
I have just explained might be changed if politicians are 
assigned to the respective bureaus giving a strong influence of 
the political power to the personnel affairs. 
  [Asahina] Is it that they are afraid the minister of 
international trade and industry may press a bureau director to 
resign? 
  [Ishihara] Well, I think the incident that took place at the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry is a problem of a 
different nature. I find it quite difficult to comment on the 
problem. To me, it is a personnel administration problem within 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and it does not 
seem proper to discuss the matter, as a whole, as a cabinet 
problem.... [ellipses as printed]. 
  [Asahina] Should promoting an officer who is to run for an 
election be strictly criticized? 
  [Ishihara] It is quite hard for me to comment as I am not 
familiar with the facts. Yet, I do not think the treatment of 
personnel at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
was very unfair. Although I think the ministry must have 
followed a reasonable procedure, I do not have any concrete 
knowledge of the situation. I can not comment as a member of 
the prime minister's office as doing so would create 
considerable influence.

<F P=106> [Second installment of an interview with Nobuo Ishihara, </F>
deputy chief cabinet secretary, by local correspondent Yutaka 
Asahina; place and date not given; first paragraph is MAINICHI 
SHIMBUN introduction] 
  [Text] Yutaka Asahina asked Nobuo Ishihara, who stands at 
the top of the bureaucracy and who has been observing politics 
and Kasumigaseki from the prime minister's office, further 
questions about the problems involved in the bureaucracy. 
  [Asahina] In your opinion, what are the merits and demerits 
of postwar bureaucracy? 
  [Ishihara] No doubt, there are more merits than demerits. 
The status of government officials has become stable under the 
postwar public service law, thus creating the administration's 
stability. The cabinet system has its own merits as each 
ministry takes its own part in carrying out important policies 
with responsibility and competing with one another. However, if 
the competition becomes excessive, it causes jurisdictional 
disputes among the ministries creating various harmful effects 
on the bureaucracy. Working for the prime minister's office, I 
have had many opportunities to observe such undesirable aspects. 
Frankly speaking, importance tends to be placed on the profit 
of a particular ministry rather than on national profit. 
  [Asahina] How do you attempt to lead them? 
  [Ishihara] My most important duty, after all, is to persuade 
the ministries to avoid competing for power, to avoid 
jurisdictional issues, and to make them carry out policies even 
if the policies are not necessarily welcomed by them. I think 
the Structural Impediments Initiative [SII] that took place at 
the time of the Kaifu cabinet was a good example. Although 
there was serious resistance by the ministries as the tasks 
required by SII were all disagreeable to them, we were finally 
able obtain their cooperation. I make it a rule to remind a 
newly appointed administrative vice minister that, while he 
represents a particular ministry, he is also representing the 
country as a whole. In that sense, I highly appreciate the 
behavior of the vice ministers and councilors of the Ministry of 
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in dealing with the recent 
rice issue. I really think they, as high-ranking officials, 
acted in a most desirable way. 
  [Asahina] They gave priority to national profit. Is that 
what you mean? 
  [Ishihara] They are most familiar with the rice growers' 
present conditions. And they were in agony as they also had the 
best knowledge as to what was happening in Geneva where the 
Uruguay Round was taking place. For the officials of the 
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, the easiest 
path was to stick to the standpoint of protecting the farmers. 
But such an attitude would have put the country into trouble. 
While faced with a dilemma, they gave priority to the profit of 
the country as a whole. It was also the administrative vice 
ministers who made the final decision at the time of SII. 
  [Asahina] Do you think more than half of the administrative 
vice ministers obtain passing marks? 
  [Ishihara] Well, I am not sure if the number is half, but I 
know there are a number of vice ministers who have made 
excellent choices while faced with hard situations. 
  [Asahina] Are there many of them? 
  [Ishihara] Yes, and I am sure because I have been working 
with them for six years. 
  [Asahina] Are there certain vice ministers who take 
different attitudes? 
  [Ishihara] Definitely, yes. They persist in following the 
standpoints of their own ministries. Though they may be praised 
for their efforts by their seniors and juniors within the 
particular ministry, they cause trouble for the country. If 
such a situation occurs, I try to talk directly to the 
administrative vice minister to give my advice. 
  [Asahina] What is your opinion of the practice of 
amakudari [landing a well-paid job in a semigovernment or 
private corporation] among government officials? 
  [Ishihara] I think criticism of the practice of appointing 
the officials to chartered corporations is reasonable, to a 
certain extent. I think the practice should be changed 
gradually, using the change of political regime as momentum. We 
hear the same opinion voiced within the coalition government. 
We also hear the view that senior positions should be open not 
only to senior officials, but also to people in the private 
sector and to staff members who have given loyal service to the 
corporation. It is necessary to reconsider the share held by 
each ministry. 
  [Asahina] We also hear criticism of the practice of sending 
a number of officials from the central government to the local 
government to hold executive posts. 
  [Ishihara] A person who has working experience with various 
self-governing bodies sometimes proves extremely useful. It is 
very important to have a staff member with experience of doing 
things in a different way. It is not desirable to either shut 
out central government's officials or to hold too many of them. 
The best idea is to maintain a mixed personnel structure. 
  [Asahina] The number of prefectural governors who are former 
officials of the Ministry of Home Affairs is increasing. What 
would you say if asked to give advice to your juniors? 
  [Ishihara] People who have been bred in the field of 
administration tend to be ignorant of the feelings of the 
general public. Though there are minimal differences between 
employees of large enterprises and government workers, workers 
at medium and small enterprises generally work under the 
uncertainty that their company might go out of business. People 
who run private enterprises or shops, or who work in agriculture 
etcetera, are in the same position and we should make every 
effort to listen to their opinions and take their feelings into 
consideration. I have the experience of working as director of 
the commerce and industry division of the Okayama prefectural 
government, and I learned very good lessons in that position by 
talking to the owners of medium and small enterprises. 
  I feel, however, that although a governor can appear fresh 
and initiate new policies for up to three terms, he tends to 
fall into a rut once he enters his fourth term. 
  [Asahina] I understand you yourself are expected to become 
governor of Tokyo? 
  [Ishihara] I cannot comment on that. Please allow me not to 
make any comment about myself.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa by </F>
MAINICHI SHIMBUN chief editorial writer Mikio Shimizu; place and 
date not given] 
  [Text] [Shimizu] On the 40th anniversary of the end of 
World War II, if you remember, you said Japan had succeeded in 
attaining the peace, freedom, and improvement in living 
standards it had sought. Later, however, the myth of Japan's 
economic growth collapsed, and politics came to a dead end. 
Will you give your assessment now that nearly 50 years have 
elapsed? 
  [Miyazawa] Any explanation by me of the last 10 years must 
include, I think, mention of the end of the Cold War and the 
demise of Marxism-Leninism. In the realm of foreign affairs, we 
had hoped that a new peace would emerge following the collapse 
of the system under which world balance was sustained by the 
mutual nuclear deterrence of the United States and the Soviet 
Union. In the short term, however, conflicts have broken out. 
The United Nations should be in charge of maintaining peace, 
but it has become apparent it can not do this. And nothing has 
yet replaced the mutual deterrence. 
  Meanwhile, there is emerging the perception that as Japan 
has 
grown into an economic power, it no longer needs to hide behind 
the United States. I should say these are the major changes 
that have occurred in the realm of foreign affairs. 
  Their impact on domestic politics is said to have brought 
the 
collapse of the regime that ruled from 1955, though I do not 
agree with that view. I do not see any reason why the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] should have lost power just because the 
1955 system disintegrated. I think the collapse of the LDP 
government was caused by the scandals. 
  [Shimizu] The rise of nationalism is conspicuous. Will you 
comment on that? 
  [Miyazawa] It may mean that as the Cold War has ended, the 
habit of thinking within the global framework of the United 
States and the Soviet Union has disappeared. As a result, 
people are becoming nationalism-conscious. I do not think it is 
unhealthy. But what we must not repeat our mistakes. 
Nationalism is becoming evident in discussions on the question 
of amending the constitution, for instance. As a result of the 
soul-searching done in the almost 50 years since the end of the 
war, people may have started to feel it is not desirable for an 
independent country to depend for ever on the Japan-U.S. 
security alliance. I do not think this is a frivolous idea, but 
I would like to stress that we should not repeat the mistakes of 
the past. A country which has inflicted pain may forget, but 
for the countries that suffered the pain, 50 years is not long 
enough to forget. 
  [Shimizu] You mean we should revise our current policy of 
emphasizing the economy, but not forget about the mistakes 
committed in the past. 
  [Miyazawa] Now that nuclear arms no longer have a place and 
the Cold War structure has gone, I think the Japanese can be 
proud that the path they have taken so far has brought them 
freedom and prosperity. The Japanese can walk their path with 
pride. Events are moving in a favorable direction for them. 
<H5>  `Decline' of the SDPJ Regrettable </H5>
  [Shimizu] Fifteen years ago, you remarked, "I think the 
people want the government to change hands. The reason why 
there has been no change in power is because people are not sure 
what the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] [SDPJ], the most 
likely opposition party to take power, will do." 
  [Miyazawa] I have devoted all my time as a politician to the 
cause of defeating Marxism-Leninism. It has become clear who 
has won. The SDPJ will fall unless they can come up with some 
really good ideas. In a way, though, I think it would be 
regrettable if the SDPJ was no longer a political force. 
  People may tell me that in politics there should be no 
complaints as long as everyone gets the same chance, but that is 
not the case in countries which are fairly economically 
advanced. I think there should be social justice to help the 
people who tend to lag behind in competition, to enable everyone 
to walk together. It is desirable that we have some people who 
keep questioning whether free competition is the only thing that 
matters. Given that, I seriously wonder whether the decline of 
the SDPJ is really a good thing. 
<H5>  Multiparties Unavoidable </H5>
  [Shimizu] Do you see any need for the political pattern of 
Japan to change? 
  [Miyazawa] The needs of the people have become very 
diversified. It has become just about impossible for any one 
party to represent 80 percent or so of the public. In advanced 
countries, you expect that in a multiparty system no party will 
get more than 30 to 40 percent backing from the people. 
  [Shimizu] In looking back at the government over the almost 
50 years since the end of the war, we cannot ignore the 
influence of the bureaucrats. You have experience of having 
served as both government official and politician. How do you 
view the bureaucratic system? 
  [Miyazawa] I may be a little screwy, but I think the 
Japanese bureaucrats do a very good job. Politicians, 
bureaucrats and businessmen each played their part to enable 
Japan to catch up with and outrun Europe and the United States. 
Such a division of labor is likely to generate collusion among 
them, but did make it possible for Japan to catch up. However, 
the moment the country did catch up, that division of labor lost 
its purpose, and the problems with collusion then started to 
surface. 
  The bureaucratic system means bureaucrats doing thed same 
things they have done in previous years. It does not set its 
own direction. Problems therefore arise if the government fails 
to show targets to the bureaucrats. If that happens, the 
division of labor system does not work too well. Some people 
have complained about bureaucrats, and insist, for instance, the 
government should have parliamentary vice ministers answer at 
Diet deliberations. All this makes me laugh. But such views 
are not so bad if we take them as revealing the belief that 
politicians should lead bureaucrats. 
  [Shimizu] It is said the bureaucrats now wield even more 
power since the coalition government came to power. 
  [Miyazawa] The coalition government was formed by parties 
wanting to enact political reform. On other matters there has 
never been any policy agreement among them. In such 
circumstances, the bureaucrats are bound to lead the government. 
  [Shimizu] How do you view the Hosokawa coalition government? 
I think nothing happens unless Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] 
General Secretary Ichiro Ozawa orders it. 
  [Miyazawa] Mr. Hosokawa has a fine personality, but he came 
to power without being prepared for it. There are many people 
around him, but they are not professionals either. I feel sorry 
about it. Mr. Ozawa is a very capable man, but it is difficult 
to head the administration from behind the scenes. It is a very 
complicated job. He has unique sense of values and is 
far-sighted too. But old people like me are very aware that we 
should not repeat the mistakes of the past, such as amending the 
Constitution, for instance.

  [Text] A recent YOMIURI SHIMBUN survey of Diet members 
finds that Shinseito, Komeito, and the Japan Democratic 
Socialist Party [DSP] hope to establish a "two-party system" by 
unifying the current coalition parties into a new-new party, 
while the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and Sakigake 
[Harbinger Party] want to establish a "moderate multiparty 
system." The survey thus indicates that the intracoalition view 
on regrouping the political parties is divided. Fifty percent 
of the Diet members responding to the survey predict either the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] or the SDPJ -- which hold the key 
to regrouping the political parties -- will split, indicating 
they feel the second stage of the political realignment is 
drawing near. 
<H5>  Possible Structure of the Future Political World </H5>
  Asked what is the most desirable structure for the future 
political world, 17.6 percent of the respondents said they hope 
the current coalition parties will be unified into a new-new 
party, followed by 9.1 percent who hope to see the current 
ruling coalition divided into two groups -- a 
"Shinseito-Komeito" group and a "SDPJ-Japan New Party 
[JNP]-Sakigake" group. 
  Most of the responding members belonging to Shinseito, 
Komeito, and the DSP said they hope to establish a "two-party" 
system -- the ruling parties versus the LDP. Particularly, this 
view was supported by nearly 60 percent of Komeito and over 40 
percent of DSP respondents. Meanwhile, most of the responding 
members who belong to the SDPJ and Sakigake said they hope to 
establish a new party composed of the SDPJ, Sakigake, and the 
JNP, followed by establishment of a "moderate multiple-party 
system." The survey thus shows that views on the regrouping of 
the political parties are clearly divided. Such a division of 
views is particularly seen among lower house members who belong 
to the ruling parties. 
  The survey shows that responding members belonging to the 
JNP 
are also divided into advocates of a "two-party system" and 
advocates of a "multiple-party system." 
  As far as the LDP is concerned, most of the responding 
members said they hope to see the ruling parties split into 
three groups -- the SDPJ, Shinseito-Komeito, and Sakigake-JNP. 
  As to how the actual structure of the political world should 
be, the respondents' answers varied, differing with their 
desired structure for the political world. Most of the 
responding members belonging to Shinseito predict the LDP and 
SDPJ would split and eventually link up with Shinseito and 
Komeito respectively. A prevailing prediction within Komeito 
responding members is that the ruling parties would break in two 
-- the SDPJ and another group. 
  However, among all respondents the percentage of those who 
"refused to answer" the question on the realignment of the 
political parties totalled over 50 percent. In particular, the 
percentage of SDPJ respondents who refused to answer totalled 
69.9 percent, indicating they still do not have clear prospects 
of the future political world because the possibility of passing 
the political reform-related bills remains uncertain. 
<H5>  Possible Split of the LDP and SDPJ </H5>
  As regards the possible split of the LDP and SDPJ, which has 
played a central role in politics since 1955, the percentage of 
those who feel either or both of the parties will split totalled 
about 50 percent. As far as upper house members who responded 
to the survey are concerned, 40.8 percent said they predict the 
split of the LDP or SDPJ. Such a percentage totalled 55.3 
percent among lower house members, who will have to campaign 
under the single-seat constituency system combined with 
proportional representation if the political reform bills are 
passed. Thus, the survey results indicate that possible reform 
of the electoral system will have an impact on the Diet members' 
prospects of the future political situation. 
  Among all respondents, 20.6 percent said both the LDP and 
SDPJ would split, 5.9 percent said only the LDP would split, and 
23.6 percent said only the SDPJ would split. 
  Particularly among responding members belonging to 
Shinseito, 
the JNP, and Sakigake, the percentage of those predicting that 
either or both the LDP and SDPJ would split totalled about 70 
percent. Among respondents belonging to Shinseito and the JNP, 
the percentage of those predicting "both the LDP and SDPJ would 
split" totalled over 40 percent, thus reflecting their hope to 
expand their influence over the move to regroup the political 
parties. 
  Among respondents belonging to the SDPJ -- whose serious 
intraparty discord over its own position within the coalition 
government was revealed at a recent party convention -- one out 
of five respondents said a party split is inevitable. This 
proves the party is in serious condition. Many respondents 
belonging to other parties also predict the split of the SDPJ 
rather than the LDP.

<F P=106> [Interview with Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan </F>
Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai), by SHUKAN 
DAIYAMONDO chief editor Yutaka Iwasa; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Iwasa] As we are ringing out the old year, I want 
you to speak first about the current economic situation. 
  [Hayami] Vowing to achieve political reform, the coalition 
formed a new government following the collapse of one-party rule 
by the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. Since then, we have been 
confronted by a series of unexpected matters on the economic 
front. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and his predecessor, 
Kiichi Miyazawa have implemented several packages of economic 
stimulus measures worth some 30 trillion yen in total. However, 
they have so far had no noticeable effect. The official 
discount rate has dropped from 6 percent to 1.75 percent in a 
period of just over two years. This is the lowest rate in 
history. The implementation of these several measures still did 
not bring forth a driving force to stimulate the economy. 
  [Iwasa] What are the causes? 
  [Hayami] Economic stimulus measures have not worked properly 
because of a political vacuum. This is the principal cause. In 
August 1992, the government announced a pump-priming package 
worth 10 trillion yen. However, the Diet passed the 
supplementary budget to finance the measures only in December. 
Then, at the beginning of the 1993 fiscal year, the government 
unveiled another economic stimulus package emphasizing public 
investment. It was worth 13 trillion yen. However, although 
there were many public works projects afoot, it was very 
difficult for local governments to actually sign contracts 
because of the sudden appreciation of the yen against the 
dollar, and because of a series of bribery scandals related to 
public works. Moreover, Japan suffered a crop loss because of 
the unusually cool summer. For all these reasons, business 
confidence has been depressed considerably. In September 1993, 
the government approved another package worth 6 trillion yen. 
The emergency economic stimulus program compiled by the Hosokawa 
government aims to create new domestic demand by promoting 
deregulation and market liberalization. Although it might not 
have an immediate impact on the economy, I think the program is 
extremely reasonable. The only problem is that we cannot 
foresee how soon it will be implemented, because the 
government's steering of Diet affairs is currently unsuccessful. 
As for political reform, the public also wants the Diet to pass 
a package of political reform bills promptly. The public wants 
the government to promote an economic stimulus program and to 
work out a tax reform plan, without creating any political 
vacuum. 
<H3>  Each Company Should Steer Its Own Course in Line With 
Structural Change, Since a Return to the Boom Period Is Only an 
Illusion </H3>
  [Iwasa] Counting on the government is not sufficient. Don't 
you think that companies also need to change themselves? 
  [Hayami] The Japanese economy is now undergoing a structural 
change. Until now, as the whole market kept on growing, each 
company was content to maintain its market share. However, we 
can no longer expect growth of this kind. The potential growth 
rate will reach only 2 to 3 percent at the most from now on. 
Under such circumstances, people just keep saying, "Times are 
still bad and there is no way out of it." This attitude is not 
good. Recently, the Japan Association of Corporate Executives 
made several proposals in a report entitled "What We Expect From 
the Economic Reform Research Council." At the beginning of the 
report, we wrote as follows: "Business is slow, and that is the 
truth. However, to think that the national economy will go back 
to its previous state is only an illusion." 
  "What are we going to do in the future?" Each company should 
ask itself this question and make its own way by keeping future 
structural change in view. To steer its own course, each 
company should be able to decide and act at its own risk. I 
think the business climate will not improve as long as companies 
do not make efforts to toe their own line. 
  [Iwasa] Do you think business leaders of today are able to 
do this? 
  [Hayami] Business leaders are now being asked to accept such 
a challenge. For instance, Keizai Doyukai is an organization 
independent of any business circle or any specific company. It 
also pays regard to individual freedom. So, compared with other 
economic organizations, our association can rather organize free 
discussions. Our members often meet to exchange views on common 
issues. These meetings prove useful because free discussions 
help members to change their minds, and the new business 
thinking brings on reform in management. 
  [Iwasa] Some other countries say the Japanese economy is not 
sluggish. What do you think of that? 
  [Hayami] I also think that Japan is not being hit by the 
recession. For example, Peter F. Drucker said that when he came 
to Japan, he could not understand why Japanese people were 
talking about the recession. This was because, when he went to 
a Chinese restaurant in a hotel, he saw a queue of people, 
including even youngsters, awaiting their turn, although the 
restaurant was really expensive. Practically speaking, Japanese 
business leaders should consider that they are now in a period 
of change rather than a period of depression. As a matter of 
course, the government should take necessary economic measures 
to meet the change. First of all, the government should revise 
the proportion of direct and indirect taxes. Direct taxes 
currently account for 72 percent of total tax revenue, while 
indirect taxes amount to 28 percent. In the near future, the 
number of Japanese capable of paying direct taxes will decrease 
as the ratio of aged people grows. 
  If the government does not take any measure, it will become 
unable to finance new spending needed in such fields as welfare 
and environmental protection. This is why the government has to 
implement a drastic tax reform. We propose an immediate 
reduction of the income tax, which would also help stimulate the 
economy. An increase in the consumption tax is necessary to 
cover the tax revenue shortfall. However, the consumption tax 
hike should be implemented after a lapse of two to three years. 
I think this is quite natural and that there is no other 
solution. However, the government is unable to materialize a 
tax reform plan because, as I just said, Prime Minister Hosokawa 
is having a hard time handling Diet affairs. 
  [Iwasa] Are companies suffering from the corporate tax? 
  [Hayami] In Japan, the corporate tax rate is about 50 
percent, while in other advanced countries it is around 20 to 40 
percent. Under such circumstances, it is no wonder that our 
competitive ability is declining. Companies distribute 
dividends after paying a 50 percent corporate tax. Therefore, 
if they want to pay a dividend of 10 percent, they will need to 
make twice as much money as the amount of the dividend. As the 
break-even point is becoming higher, the corporate tax rate 
should be reduced so that business executives can have a larger 
scope in running their companies. 
  There are two lines of measures that have to be implemented 
immediately to stimulate the economy. 
<H3>  Reducing the Gap Between Domestic and Global Prices 10 to 20 
Percent by Improving Productivity in Nontradable Goods </H3>
  [Hayami] Prime Minister Hosokawa has vowed to work out 
measures to create a more consumer-oriented economy, with the 
emphasis on improving living standards, as well as measures to 
turn Japanese society into one in harmony with the international 
community. For that, he should first try to correct the gap 
between domestic and global prices caused by the rapid 
appreciation of the yen against the dollar. Japan's trade 
surplus of some 130 billion dollars is behind the yen's exchange 
rate of 108 yen to the dollar. However, when we make a 
comparison between Japan and the United States, or between Tokyo 
and New York, we realize that the purchasing power parity of the 
yen against the dollar is around 170 yen to 180 yen. The gap 
between Japanese and U.S. prices has reached nearly 50 percent 
over the past few years. 
  In brief, the purchasing power of the yen is weak at home, 
while it is very strong abroad. Both exports and imports are 
the cause of this gap. This problem is especially serious in 
the sector of nontradable goods. This low-productivity sector 
is protected, thanks to the granting of subsidies and price 
regulation. Consumers are the sole sufferers from these 
measures, since they have to buy the goods despite the high 
prices. The productivity of this sector, which does not need to 
compete with foreign rivals, is extremely low, compared with the 
similar sector in the United States. As long as the government 
does not gradually dismantle regulations and protectionist 
measures in this sector, the yen's purchasing power will never 
rise at home. 
  [Iwasa] What do you propose as a concrete measure to narrow 
the existing gap? 
  [Hayami] First of all, if we find a foreign product of good 
quality that is less expensive than the domestic product, we 
should import it, period. Meanwhile, there are some sectors 
that are still obliged to maintain their work force, even though 
it is unprofitable. We should create a new high-productivity 
sector so that surplus workers of the inefficient sectors can be 
transferred. The creation of a new sector and the transfer of 
surplus workers will temporarily cause friction. However, we 
should make efforts and manage to find a good solution without 
victimizing consumers. The government should promote economic 
measures in this direction by aiming at reducing the gap between 
domestic and global prices some 10 to 20 percent. For instance, 
Japanese travelers usually say that everything was really 
inexpensive, as they return to Narita Airport carrying a pile of 
foreign goods in their arms. This is definitely strange. If we 
create a sort of offshore market or free market in which 
products will be sold at a price based on the real exchange rate 
of the yen against the dollar, for example 108 yen or 109 yen, 
consumers will immediately become aware that something is really 
wrong with the current purchasing power of the yen. 
  [Iwasa] This is an interesting idea. 
  [Hayami] Unfortunately, we need to clear several regulations 
which exist under the Customs Act, the Large-Scale Retail Stores 
Act, and so on in order to create an offshore market. If the 
government makes an exception to the rule to enable us to 
surmount the obstacle to the establishment of an offshore 
market, I think we will get an interesting result. 
  [Iwasa] Could you please explain the second line of 
economic measures? 
  [Hayami] In Japan, personal savings or personal monetary 
assets now total some 1 quadrillion yen, thanks to the 
consistent policy to encourage savings which has been promoted 
since the end of the war, and thanks to the laudable Japanese 
custom of thrift and saving. (laughter) When I was in the 
service of the Bank of Japan, I also participated in a savings 
campaign. There is no doubt that Japan's postwar rehabilitation 
and Japan's postwar growth were supported by the savings 
movement. However, we are now suffering from insufficient 
consumption and investment due to oversaving. It is not easy to 
make consumers buy expensive products under the existing 
situation, because they have already bought more or less 
everything they want, and because they are anxious about the 
employment situation. The household economy does not involve 
only consumption. There is also investment, and we can 
encourage consumers to invest more. 
  We should particularly encourage housing investment aimed at 
improving living standards. For instance, in the United States 
or Britain, a preferential treatment is applied to taxpayers who 
have a house built. Not only those who build their own house 
for the first time, but those who sell a house to build a new 
one, or those who get a cottage, are also subject to the 
preferential treatment. The government might defend itself, 
saying the Housing Loan Corporation is extending loans at a low 
interest rate. However, preferably, the government should 
encourage housing investment also by adopting a preferential 
treatment to lighten the interest payment burden of those who 
have a house built by borrowing money from a private financial 
institution. The government used to emphasize the promotion of 
personal savings, while nothing has been done so far to 
encourage investment. 
<H5>  What People Need Now Is a Japanese Dream </H5>
  [Iwasa] Before building a house, you first have to get a 
lot. However, you cannot buy a piece of land so easily. 
  [Hayami] In Japan, a huge portion of farmland remains idle. 
It now involves an area of 700,000 to 800,000 hectares, which is 
equivalent to 80 percent of the total housing area. The 
government should take necessary steps to facilitate the 
development of uncultivated farmland for housing. Do you not 
think it would be great, if you could live in a big house where 
each member of your family would have enough space to do 
whatever they like. The acquisition of a big house is essential 
if you want to experience good living. The social climate is 
gloomy because people see no hope for the future. This is why 
we need a Japanese dream, which is to live comfortably in a big 
house. Moreover, the acquisition of a house helps create new 
demand for various products, such as household electric 
appliances. Therefore, it will have a tremendous effect as a 
medium- and long-term economic stimulus measure. An affluent 
society in the true sense is a society in which you can easily 
afford a big house and experience good living. It is the 
measure to facilitate the acquisition of a house that will help 
people to live comfortably. 
  [Iwasa] I agree with you. My last question is "How do you 
foresee 1994?" 
  [Hayami] People will do their best to change their thinking 
in order to cope with the unfolding changes. Japanese companies 
will try to change, based on the view that consumers will 
achieve self-reformation. In other words, Japanese companies 
will go through a process similar to that of U.S. companies a 
few years ago. Some people say the transfer of production 
centers to overseas is nonsense. However, I do not think so. 
If the product can be manufactured outside Japan at low cost, 
we should automatically switch to overseas production. At the 
same time, we should promote the production of high-value-added 
products inside Japan. It is not premature at all to carry out 
this kind of production transfer. In the United States, the 
development of new business has been supported by talented 
people who joined minor companies after they were forced to 
leave big companies because of rationalization. New businesses 
helped increase U.S. exports, promoting the recovery of the U.S. 
economy. It will not be so easy to bring on change without 
completely dismantling our laudable customs, such as the 
lifetime employment system, because it will cause friction. 
However, if we know that we can never go back to the previous 
period of prosperity, I am sure we will be able to accomplish 
reform. The year 1994 will be one of self-reformation and 
structural reform. I am not so pessimistic about the future 
(laughter). [as published]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The New Line-Up of the Toyoda-led </F>
Keidanren"] 
  [Text] Shoichiro Toyoda, 68, chairman of Toyota Motor 
Corporation, has been chosen as the next chairman of Keidanren 
[Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan]. It will be a 
heavy burden for business leader Toyoda, even though he is 
younger than incumbent Keidanren Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa, 79, an 
adviser to the Tokyo Electric Company. 
  The job will include maintaining economic growth through 
reform of the structure of the Japanese economy, forming new 
relationships between political and business sectors, and 
promoting cooperation with other Asian countries which enjoy 
rapid economic growth. 
  His first task will be to appoint influential figures as his 
assistants so that he can use them as part of a team to tackle 
difficult tasks. This article looks at the likely new Keidanren 
line-up under Toyoda, including the candidates for vice chairman. 
  Hiraiwa originally expected Sony Corporation Chairman Akio 
Morita, 72, to be his successor. But when Morita fell ill 
recently he had to consider someone else. Toyoda, head of the 
nation's top manufacturer, was "the safest selection" for 
Hiraiwa. The names of other Keidanren vice chairmen had to be 
dropped from consideration as chairman because of such factors 
as their companies' business slump. They included Hiroshi 
Saito, 73, chairman of Nippon Steel Corporation [NSC]; Yoichiro 
Iida, 73, chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries [MHI]; and 
Yutaka Kume, 72, chairman of Nissan Motor Company. Hiraiwa 
selected Toyoda because he was younger than others and his 
company had performed well and was known internationally -- 
requirements Hiraiwa wanted his successor to meet. 
  At the very beginning of this year, Hiraiwa started to 
prepare the way for the appointment of Toyoda. He began the 
preliminary work and consensus building needed in seeking 
agreement from all related parties before making an official 
decision. He told influential business leaders such as Honorary 
Keidanren Chairman Eishiro Saito, 82, and Keidanren Council 
Chairman Takuji Matsuzawa, 80, an adviser to Fuji Bank, that "I 
am planning to appoint Mr. Toyoda as my successor." 
  Having been convinced there was no strong opposition to the 
appointment of Toyoda, the second youngest Keidanren vice 
chairmen, Hiraiwa on 13 January asked Toyoda, who was leaving 
for Britain on a business trip the next day, "to be his 
successor." 
  Hiraiwa made the offer at a party given in appreciation of 
the services of the Economic Reform Research Council (an 
advisory panel to the prime minister) held at the prime 
minister's official residence in the afternoon. 
  Toyoda replied: "I accept your offer." His acceptance made 
him the unofficial head of Keidanren. 
  Toyoda served as Keidanren vice chairman for four years, 
while Hiraiwa became chairman after serving as vice chairman for 
12 and a half years. There is no denying that compared to 
Toyoda, Hiraiwa had accumulated much more experience by the time 
he became chairman, so it is certain that Keidanren will adopt a 
group leadership system to help Toyoda. Under the system the 
head of the Kendanren Council, an advisory body to the Keidanren 
chairman, and influential vice chairmen participate in the 
chairman's decisionmaking. Taking this into consideration, 
Hiraiwa and Toyoda will together decide on the new lineup. 
  Keidanren rules say the chairman and vice chairman should 
be 70 years or younger and they are limited to two four-year 
terms. Hiraiwa and council chairman Matsuzawa are to resign 
before their terms expire six months from now. Among the vice 
chairmen, those who will resign after serving two terms are 
Komatsu Ltd. Chairman Ryoichi Kawai, 76, MHI Chairman Iida, NSC 
Chairman Saito, and Toyoda. Four vice chairmanships are to be 
vacated by them. There is a possibility that with the exceptions 
to the rule, Iida and Saito will remain vice chairmen. However, 
the possibility is slim. Instead, there is strong probability 
that one of them will be appointed as successor to council 
chairman Matsuzawa. 
  Among other vice chairmen, those who will complete their 
fourth year term in December this year are Isao Nakauchi, 71, 
chairman and president of Daiei Inc.; Kenji Kawakatsu, 69, 
chairman of Sanwa Bank; and Katsuhiro Utada, 68, honorary 
chairman of and an adviser to Ajinomoto Company. There is a 
widely-accepted view that "to avoid confusion, these three vice 
chairmen should resign after completing their four-year terms 
and not in mid-term as Hiraiwa is doing." 
  If things go as expected, Keidanren will select four new 
vice 
chairmen at its general meeting in May and the remaining three 
at its extraordinary meeting in December. 
  At any rate, Keidanren will select seven new vice chairmen 
this year. 
  Those considered the most likely candidates for vice 
chairmanship are Sho Nasu, 69, chairman of Tokyo Electric Power 
Company; Kenichi Suematsu, 67, president of Sakura Bank; and 
Yotaro Kobayashi, 60, chairman of Fuji Xerox Company. Like 
Hiraiwa, Nasu is in the electric power business. Suematsu is 
expected to represent the Mitsui Group in Keidanren because 
there is currently no representative from the group serving as 
vice chairman. Komatsu is the acting chairman of the 
Japanese-U.S. Economic Council [name as published]. In 
addition, NSC President Takashi Imai, 64, is expected to take 
the vice chairman's seat to be vacated by NSC Chairman Saito. 
  Hiraiwa and Toyoda are likely decide whom they should 
appoint 
as the remaining vice chairmen after taking into account future 
Keidanren management plans. 
  Currently, the idea has surfaced of appointing as vice 
chairman Reiichi Yumikura, 65, president of Asahi Chemical 
Industry Company, or Katsunosuke Maeda, 62, president of Toray 
Industries Inc. Yumikura is chairman of a council which 
discusses important topics such as the antimonopoly law and 
distribution, for future economic reform. In addition to them, 
Sukenari Ito, 65, president of Nippon Life Insurance Company, 
could possibly be named new vice chairman to represent the 
insurance sector. Appointing Takeo Shiina, 64, chairman of IBM 
Japan, as Keidanren vice chairman is also under consideration in 
the expectation that he will work to strengthen ties with 
foreign economic organizations.

Article Type:BFN 

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Government Should Not Be So Concerned About </F>
the Timing of Raising the Consumption Tax"] 
  [Text] What the people desire most now, probably, is for 
the nation to regain its economic vitality soon and to develop 
into an economic society in which the people can live in 
security. It is for this reason that we have persistently 
called on the government to overhaul the tax system -- by 
readjusting the ratio of direct and indirect taxes -- and to 
proceed with implementing income tax cuts on that premise [that 
the tax system will be overhauled]. The Tax Commission's 
interim report compiled in November essentially is based on this 
line of thinking, too. 
  The problem is how specifically this thinking can be 
reflected in the tax system reform to be carried out next year. 
We would like to insist that the concept of "effecting in one 
package" the income tax cut and consumption tax increase -- as 
proposed in the Tax Commission's report -- should be interpreted 
flexibly. 
  The Finance Ministry has recently been persisting in saying 
that "even if and when the income tax cut is implemented first, 
the relevant bill supporting it should state clearly when the 
consumption tax will be raised." But such a policy will 
substantially undercut the effect as an economic stimulus 
measure which it is hoped that the tax cut will have. 
  As a matter of principle, no doubt, what is desirable is to 
implement the income tax cut and the increase in the consumption 
tax at the same time. But with the economic recession only 
worsening, there have emerged opinions that the tax system 
overhaul should be put to use in boosting the economy and that 
the income tax cut should proceed [prior to increasing the 
consumption tax]. But according to the Finance Ministry, even 
when that happens, it should happen only after it is written in 
the law that the consumption tax should be raised in turn to 
prevent the income tax cut from "continuing freely." That 
policy may be logical as far as the Finance Ministry is 
concerned. After all, it is the office which needs to guard 
against the national treasury growing poorer. 
<H5>  The Economic Outlook Is Growing Grimmer </H5>
  But we think that such a policy is no longer realistic. We 
would like to note that economic conditions have further 
deteriorated while the Hosokawa government has stood idle. 
  The mid-term and long-term assessments of the economy by 
corporate managers and consumers is growing grimmer. They 
appear to think that even if the nation does succeed in escaping 
its current swamp, there will be no hope of achieving the annual 
3.5-percent growth rate envisaged in the government's Five-Year 
Economic Plan To Achieve a Better Quality of Life. 
  The best indication of such a mood may be that major 
companies all have rushed toward revising their mid-term and 
long-term employment plans and readjusting existing jobs. Even 
where the spring labor offensive for wage increases is 
concerned, the best that the unions can hope for is a wage 
increase consisting of routine promotions. We cannot at this 
time hope that national consumption, which is being affected by 
the double blows of employment uneasiness and restrained wages, 
to increase. 
  Naturally, the raise in the consumption tax should be 
effected only on the grand premise that the economy has fully 
returned on track. Under the given economic situation, it is 
impossible to make any predictions. There is no guarantee that 
the nation will be in any condition to implement the consumption 
tax increase by the spring of next year as is claimed by the 
Finance Ministry. 
  Some in the government appear to think that "if the date 
that 
the tax will be increased is publicized beforehand, that can 
induce the people to hurry to spend before that time." No one 
can deny that possibility, but we also have to think about what 
will happen after that. It is only common sense to expect that 
there will be instances of backlash. 
  But we object to the idea of uncoupling a consumption tax 
increase [from the income tax cut] which is being mentioned by 
some people in the ruling and opposition camps, as well as in 
business circles. Before the income tax is cut, it is only 
natural that the maximum available sources of revenue to cover 
the shortfall caused by the cut should be found -- through 
administrative reforms and by correcting the unfair tax system. 
But if that happens, the effect of cutting the tax is bound to 
decrease also. But, if that is not done, the financial 
conditions will worsen further. Moreover, it will become 
impossible to carry out the tax system reform pertaining to the 
upcoming aging society. 
  Seen from that viewpoint, we believe that the concept of 
"effecting in one package" [the income tax cut and the 
consumption tax increase] needs to be maintained. We will not 
discuss the legal technicalities, but we do insist that the 
government come up with a way of incorporating in the bill a 
clause to the effect that "once the economy recovers, the 
consumption tax will be raised." 
  What is important is that the basic position on implementing 
both the tax system overhaul and the income tax reduction [ahead 
of the consumption tax increase] not be altered. 
  The scale of the income tax cut should never be reduced just 
because the time to implement the income tax cut has not yet 
been set. Since the announcement of the overall economic 
stimulus measures at the end of August, a total of 30 trillion 
yen's worth of projects have been launched, but they have made 
almost no contribution to economic stimulation. The reason for 
this is that there has not been enough so-called "fresh water" 
that could lead to the direct creation of demand. Besides, the 
measures came out piecemeal. 
  The tax cut must be full-fledged in its scale -- in its role 
as an economic stimulus measure and as part of the tax system 
overhaul plan. As we have persistently pointed out so far, it 
is essential to secure a tax cut of at least 6 trillion yen by 
easing the progressive curve in tax burdens on the middle income 
bracket. The burdens of the income tax and residents tax on 
middle and higher income earners are now nearly back to where 
they were prior to the previous tax reform. What the tax 
authorities call "energy for reform" has accumulated adequately. 
<H5>  Don't Fall Into the Pace of the Bureaucrats </H5>
  What concerns us is that while the politicians have stopped 
moving, the bureaucrats appear to have increased in power. As 
long as the Finance Ministry holds power, it is apt to persist 
in its position of demanding balanced finances. But the given 
conditions dictate that the financial functions play a valuable 
role in "shoring up the economy." 
  We urge the government and the ruling coalition parties to 
begin discussions and to agree on the advance implementation of 
the income tax cut. The economy itself is not pausing. The 
longer the decision to deal with it is delayed, the harder it 
becomes for a policy decision to be effective. 
  We also have demands of the Tax Commission. The commission 
is delaying discussions on the question of an income tax and the 
consumption tax -- which will be the central theme of the tax 
system reform next year -- using the excuse that the Hosokawa 
government has not presented a basic policy on it. But is that 
a good enough excuse? 
  The commission should fill in the policy portion, which the 
coalition parties are not familiar with, by holding discussions 
on its own and by presenting many ideas. That will certainly 
not lead to a narrowing of the scope of political alternatives, 
as is claimed by some people in the ruling parties. 
  The tax system has a direct impact on the lives of the 
people. The people are concerned about what will happen to tax 
rates and into which bracket they will fall under the system, 
and they want to find out if changes envisaged in the new tax 
system are reasonable. As such, they want to have information 
with which to make their decisions -- as much as possible and as 
soon as possible. 
  But we wonder whether the Tax Commission has not fallen into 
the pace of the bureaucrats. We hope that the incident of 
Commission Chairman Kato recently retracting his earlier 
remarks, for instance, does not prove that that was what 
happened. We want the commission to do its work independently 
on its own.

<F P=106> [From Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 24 January </F>
Evening Edition] 
  [Text] Commenting on the formulation of the draft fiscal 
1994 budget, which has been delayed due to the problem of 
political reform, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura 
said at a news conference on the morning of 24 January: "We work 
on the premise that the schedule for the Japan-U.S. summit 
meeting (on 11 February) cannot be moved. We would like to make 
a decision on the draft budget before the U.S. trip." However, 
he also explained: "In view of the (tumultuous) political 
situation, we need to coordinate with the deliberations (within 
the ruling parties) on the taxation system, and discussions at 
the government Tax Commission before making a final decision. I 
have a feeling we are running out of time." He thus indicated 
that there is a possibility that the government's draft budget 
may be delayed depending on future developments. 
  Regarding economic stimulation measures, which are scheduled 
to be announced within this week, Takemura said: "The 
(government and ruling parties') conference on economic issues 
will be convened as early as possible this week, instead of next 
week, while deliberations on political reform are also in 
progress. Since (economic stimulation measures) are an issue of 
great interest to the people, we would like to deal with this 
issue while working on political reform even amid the present 
turmoil."

<F P=106> [Article by Jotaro Yabe of the Japan Fair Trade Commission: </F>
"Freedom of Distributors Restricted; Problems Include Rebates 
for Reaching Goals"] 
  [Text] 1. It makes economic sense for automakers to 
organize their distributors into keiretsu. For example, it 
contributes to maintaining after-sales service and to raising 
sales efficiency. On the other hand, it prevents the entry of 
foreign cars into the market, and is thus seen as a problem. 
  2. There are no contractual restrictions on the 
handling of competitors' products by dealers. Business practices 
such as rebates, however, restrict the freedom of dealers to 
handle other manufacturers' cars, including foreign cars. 
  3. In order to make the auto market more open, it is 
necessary to change both the system of rebates linked to sales 
goals and the practice of assigning clearly defined sales 
territories to dealers. 
<H5>  No Contractual Restrictions on Handling Competitors' Products </H5>
  Both domestically and abroad, interest in the pros and cons 
of keiretsu is increasing. As part of its survey on keiretsu, 
the Fair Trade Commission investigated the actual state of the 
transactions among companies in four separate industries: plate 
glass, paper, automobiles, and automobile parts. The results of 
the survey have already been made public. With regard to 
automobiles, there are two types of keiretsu transactions: 
transactions between auto makers and parts makers (manufacturing 
keiretsu), and transactions between auto makers and dealers 
(sales keiretsu). Both types are problematic. The one that will 
be discussed here, however, is sales keiretsu. To begin with, 
the actual state of these keiretsu will be broadly analyzed. 
  In recent years, foreign cars have comprised a growing 
proportion of the passenger cars sold in Japan. Nevertheless, 
this proportion is still around 5 percent. It is believed that, 
in Japan, the distribution networks are controlled by auto 
makers and exclusionary business practices are conducted, making 
it difficult for foreign cars to enter the market. 
  Passengers cars are sold from the manufacturer, through the 
dealer (retailer), to the customer. Manufacturers have built 
sales channels for selling their products. The top manufacturers 
deal with dealers through multiple sales channels, each for a 
different model of automobile. In the case of Toyota, for 
example, Toyopet stores mainly sell Mark II and Corona, while 
Toyota stores mainly sell Crown and Carina. 
  In Japan, there are 3,759 companies classified as dealers 
(the number of stores is approximately 17,400). Auto makers have 
invested in about 16 percent of them. The vast majority of 
dealers are thus independent companies. Dealers are essentially 
free to choose which manufacturer's cars to sell and which 
region to sell them in. In regard to the Antimonopoly Law, 
questions about keiretsu arise in connection with whether the 
means of keiretsu organization--the exclusionary conditions and 
the restrictive conditions--interfere with fair and open 
competition in the sale of automobiles. 
  If a manufacturer imposes on the dealer a restriction saying 
that the dealer may not sell the products of competitors, then 
the transactions that follow, due to this exclusionary 
condition, will be problematic under the Antimonopoly Law. In 
trade contracts between manufacturers and dealers there used to 
be a clause stipulating that the dealer could not sell the 
products of competitors. In 1979, however, this clause was 
removed under instructions from the Fair Trade Commission; but 
there was subsequently another provision stating that the dealer 
had to consult with the manufacturer before changing an 
important matter of business, and it was not clear whether the 
handling of other companies' cars was something requiring 
advance consultation. 
  Following the issuance, in 1991, of the "Antimonopoly Law 
Guidelines for Distribution and Trade Practices," all auto 
makers voluntarily reviewed the problematic terms in their 
contracts, clearly stated in their contracts that the handling 
of other companies' cars by dealers was not something that 
required advance consultation, and notified dealers that they 
were free to handle the products of competitors. Accordingly, 
provisions that might restrict dealers from handling 
competitors' products no longer appear in current contracts. 
<H5>  Restrictions on Selling Outside One's Territory Are Illegal </H5>
  In this latest survey, not a single case was found of a 
dealer handling the cars of more than one domestic manufacturer. 
On the other hand, dealers handling imported cars have recently 
increased. Most entered the field in response to efforts by 
domestic manufacturers to recruit dealers to sell imported cars. 
The reason, they say, that they have not sought on their own to 
handle the cars of other manufacturers, is that they would 
become unable to provide detailed service if the car models that 
they handled became numerous. But there are probably other 
reasons as well. 
  Manufacturers, in their contracts with dealers, stipulate 
goals for the number of cars to be sold. In principle, this 
number is decided by consultation between the manufacturer and 
the dealer. There have been cases, however, where the decision 
tended to be linked to coercive practices, such as the 
manufacturer unilaterally designating the sales goal or 
assigning the dealer a certain number of cars; or where the 
sales goal was decided based on the dealer's full sales capacity. 
  At the same time, manufacturers pay dealers a variety of 
rebates. There is a rebate for each car sold, of 30,000 yen. 
However, the large rebates are for reaching the sales goal and 
for expanding market share. The amount of the former is based on 
the number of cars established in advance as the sales goal. The 
latter is based on the market share attained in the dealer's 
main sales territory. 
  In general, a manufacturer setting a sales goal and paying a 
rebate if the dealer reaches it is not itself a problem under 
the Antimonopoly Law. However, the manufacturer setting the 
sales goal near the dealer's sales capacity and using such 
methods as rebates to ensure that the goal is reached, in effect 
restricts the dealer from handling the cars of other 
manufacturers. So, from the standpoint of free and open 
competition, it cannot be said that nothing is wrong [with these 
practices]. 
  Manufacturers designate a certain area as the dealer's main 
sales territory. Within it, the dealer is obliged to conduct 
vigorous sales activities. Where the dealer can locate his 
dealership[s] is thus limited to his territory. As their sales 
territories, Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. basically 
use the nation's prefectures, for each of which they have one 
dealer. If this practice does not restrict sales to customers 
outside the territory or sales to customers coming in from 
outside the territory, then it is not a violation of the 
Antimonopoly Law. 
  The reasons for establishing sales territories include: it 
enables quick, accurate after-sales service; it prevents 
overlapping investments by dealers; and it enables sales 
activities to be conducted effectively within the territories. 
Many dealers feel that they are not contractually restricted 
from conducting sales outside their territories. However, not a 
few feel, "I can't conduct sales activities outside my 
territory," or "I can't sell to customers from outside my 
territory, even if they come to me." 
  In a questionnaire survey on how dealers handle customers 
who 
come to them from outside their territories to make a purchase, 
less than 20 percent said that they voluntarily refuse to make 
the sale and instead, for example, refer the customer to the 
dealer in his territory. Also, some manufacturers use the number 
of cars sold to customers from the dealer's territory, rather 
than the total number of cars sold, as the basis for rebates. In 
such cases, the dealer does not get a rebate on cars sold to 
customers from outside his territory, and so ends up losing 
incentive to sell to such customers. 
<H3>  The Market for Maintenance and Repair Parts Is Also 
Exclusionary </H3>
  It has been pointed out that the market for maintenance and 
repair parts, like that for passenger cars, is exclusionary. 
There are two kinds of maintenance and repair parts: genuine, 
brand-name parts supplied by auto makers; and non-genuine parts 
supplied directly to the market by parts manufacturers. Before 
auto makers can supply assembly parts, that they purchase from 
parts manufacturers, directly to the maintenance and repair 
market, they must obtain the consent of the parts manufacturers. 
This done, they can purchase as repair and maintenance parts the 
same parts that they use as assembly parts, and then supply them 
directly to the market through their sales channels. 
  In their contracts with auto makers, dealers used to be 
obliged "to use genuine parts" for maintenance and repair. Then, 
in 1991, when these contracts were revised, this clause was 
eliminated. However, there are certain sales channels that 
provide a rebate that promotes the handling of genuine parts and 
so has the effect of restricting the handling of non-genuine 
parts. Moreover, when the auto maker demands the parts 
manufacturer's advance consent in order to supply the market 
with parts independently developed by the parts manufacturer 
without any contribution of know-how by the auto maker, the 
parts manufacturer, if he grants his consent, ends up with the 
freedom of his business activities restricted, which is a 
problem. 
  As mentioned before, the number of dealers handling foreign 
cars has increased. However, these dealers have not always been 
acting voluntarily. In order to open up the market for cars and 
parts, the Fair Trade Commission has pointed out to auto makers 
both the problems revealed by the latest survey results and the 
Commission's views about them, and has encouraged auto makers to 
voluntarily grapple with solving those problems. 
  In the future, the Fair Trade Commission will work to 
understand the kinds of measures [that automakers] take in 
response to the problems that were pointed out to them; and will 
watch, from the standpoint of free and open competition, whether 
the factors causing the exclusionary and closed character of the 
auto and auto parts markets are eliminated.

  [Text] European Automakers Begin Reorganizing 
  Aiming to complement each other with regard to market 
[position] and car models, Renault and Volvo will merge by 
January 1994. The curtain has risen on the drama of the European 
auto industry's reorganization. 
  There are two major factors driving the reorganization. One 
is the rapid deterioration of the European auto market. The 
number of new passenger cars registered in the 17 European 
countries from January through July was 6,965,800. Compared to 
the same period last year, this was a decrease of 18.3 percent. 
The Japanese new car market also dropped off during the same 
period, but only by 7.1 percent. 
  Regarding this rapid market shrinkage, the research 
department of a major automaker said, "The European economic 
recession is largely to blame, but another cause is that auto 
emission standards have become stricter due to EC integration, 
which began this January." And about the current sales slump, an 
auto analyst in Europe predicted, "Just as the wave of 
prosperity from 1985 to 1989 was long, this slump will also be 
long." This analyst is thus of the view that "the sales slump 
will continue for a while." 
<H5>  The Threat of Japanese Cars </H5>
  The second factor driving reorganization is the Japanese 
auto 
offensive. In 1980, 1,220,000 Japanese cars were exported to 
Europe, whereas in 1992, that number was up to 1,600,000. 
  Since last year, Nissan has increased the models being 
produced at its British plant. Honda and Toyota are also 
starting up new plants in England. And Mitsubishi Motors, in a 
joint venture with Volvo, plans to begin production in 1995. The 
number of Japanese cars is thus expected to increase still 
further. 
  "The Japanese auto industry has 30 percent greater 
productivity than the German," said Mercedes' Environmental 
Policy Director Lacheem, who fears that competitiveness. The 
view of one auto analyst in Europe--that "Japanese market share 
here, as in the U.S., will rise to near 30 percent (it is now 12 
percent)"--is not necessarily an exaggeration. 
  Against this offensive from Japanese autos, the EC Committee 
has established monitoring levels for them and implemented 
import volume restrictions. Moreover, despite the fact that on 
April 1 the committee decided to reduce the 1993 monitoring 
level to 1,089,000 vehicles--9.4 percent less than the previous 
year's actual number of imports--on September 4 it cut this 
level by nearly 10 percent more, to 980,000 vehicles, 18.5 
percent less than the previous year's number of imports. "This 
was because the drop in the European market became even more 
serious than at the time of the April agreement," said EC 
Committee Vice Chairman Bangeman. Even so, it could probably 
still be said that the Europeans acted precipitously. 
  The main reason for this is that, amid the severe slump in 
the European market, Japanese cars have steadily been extending 
their sway. 
  Although the volume of Japanese cars continues to be down by 
a double-digit rate from last year, their 12 percent market 
share for January-July represents an increase of 0.2 points from 
the same period last year. And in 1999, the restrictions on the 
import of Japanese cars will be lifted. It will soon be 
impossible [for the Europeans] to rely only on politics. 
<H3>  Mergers, More Car Models, Personnel Reductions; 
Manufacturers Also Frantically Restructuring </H3>
  In particular, "Mercedes Benz of Germany has been undergoing 
a major transformation since its new president took over this 
May," said Nobuyoshi Yoshida, Director of the Automobile 
Management and Development Research Center. Until now, Mercedes 
has limited its annual production to 600,000 vehicles, and has 
covered rising personnel expenses by increasing car luxury and 
price. It recently announced, however, that it will begin local 
production in the United States; moreover, it will begin making 
cars for the masses. It has thus embarked in a new direction. 
And though it reduced its work force by 13,000 people in 1992, 
it plans to cut another 27,000 by the end of 1994. 
  "Mercedes' entry into mass cars is especially significant," 
said Director Yoshida. "It's because the European automakers, 
which, until now, have existed through a certain degree of 
isolation, have been caught by the competition." At the Motor 
Show held in Frankfurt, Germany in September, there was an 
abundance of concept cars in the compact category. They included 
Mercedes' Vision A, with a displacement of 1.2 liters; BMW's E1; 
Opel's Tigora; and Ford's Sub B. Competition in the compact car 
market is likely to become quite fierce. 
  Accordingly, in addition to making cars that are appealing, 
a 
major point will be how to reduce their cost. In this 
connection, the use of common parts by different companies, 
which is already being done, should develop even further. And to 
strengthen the benefits of this practice, companies will 
probably form tie-ups--that is, mergers. 
  Here, the company that might be mentioned first is Fiat, 
which has survived due to Italy's protective policies. When EC 
integration was decided and market liberalization began, Fiat 
rapidly lost competitiveness. In 1989, it had the top share in 
the European market, whereas in 1992 its share dropped to 
fourth. Rumors are circulating that it will merge with France's 
Peugeot. 
  There is also a report that the company with the 
ninth-ranking market share, Rover of England, will be acquired 
by VW. This spring, VW, whose position in England is weak, 
converted its distribution subsidiary there to a full-faceted 
subsidiary. This is thought to be a preparatory step for 
acquiring Rover. 
  Moreover, Mercedes and many other European companies, aware 
that their productivity is inferior to that of Japanese 
companies, want production technology from the latter. The Dutch 
commercial vehicle manufacturer, Dafu, due to, among other 
things, administrative difficulties, has asked Mitsubishi Motors 
to buy its plant in England. 
  But Japanese companies are also in dire straits and cannot 
vigorously lead the way in reorganization. If the yen continues 
to appreciate, however, it will become hard for them to export 
to Europe, forcing them to switch to producing there. 
  The number of tie-ups between Japanese and European 
automakers is still limited. Nevertheless, one possible approach 
is, like Mitsubishi Motors, to form a joint venture with a 
Europeanmaker and produce a new line in an existing European 
plant. In the future, the relationship between Japanese and 
European makers will probably extend beyond sales cooperation in 
the Japanese market to production cooperation in Europe.

<F P=106> [Article by Akira Noguchi, Momoko Itoh, and Jun Fukuda] </F>
  [Text] The Japanese automotive industry which 
surpassed the world during the 1980's is facing a major crisis. 
In addition to the strong yen and the stagnant domestic economy, 
the biggest threat of all is the comeback of the U.S. side. In 
order for them to be able to extract themselves from this 
difficult situation, it will be essential for [Japanese 
automakers] to forget their pride and embark on large-scale 
restructuring. 
  "It may not be possible to protect the employment of union 
personnel amid just the framework of one finished car maker and 
one parts maker alone. The gap between firms is widening, with 
domestic production of finished car makers like Toyota, Nissan, 
Honda Motor, Mazda falling significantly. In the future, even 
our union will have to think about securing employment that 
transcends the limits of such groups and corporate keiretsu." 
This statement indicates the unprecedented feeling of crisis 
executives of Japan's largest union, Confederation of Japan 
Automobile Workers' Unions, have with respect to the recession. 
This union has as many as 820,000 members, including workers 
from finished car makers such as Toyota Motor and Nissan Motor, 
and parts makers such as Nippondenso and Unisia Jecs, as well as 
all the nation's dealers under its umbrella. 
  Japanese automakers, which in the 1980's surpassed the 
leading makers of the world such as GM, Ford, Chrysler in the 
United States, Germany's Volkswagen (VW), and France's Peugeot 
and the like, and took their place as number one in the world, 
are facing a domestic sales slump and strong yen exchange rate 
that has exceeded expectations. They are experiencing a major 
crisis that "could sink the ship that had been Japan's key 
industry," according to Nissan Motor President Yoshifumi Tsuji. 
  The U.S. side, looking askance at the slump of the Japanese 
makers, has achieved a comeback and even European makers such as 
VW, Mercedes Benz, are embarking on large scale restructuring. 
At this rate if the Japanese side stands idle, the possibility 
of a "U.S.-Japanese reversal" cannot be denied. 
  One question is whether they can ride out this slump just by 
rationalization measures such as holding down the number 
personnel and reducing expenses. Another question is whether 
there is a likelihood of another domestic plant closing like 
Nissan's Zama plant. If the system of eleven finished car 
makers, which is rare in the world, were to collapse, could a 
natural selection or reorganization occur? Currently, at a time 
when "employment uneasiness" has become an urgent issue, it is 
natural that the labor leadership would have an elevated level 
of anxiety about the future of Japan's automotive industry. 
<H3>  The Competitiveness Gap Between Japan and U.S. Suddenly 
Narrows </H3>
  "Isn't Chrysler going to exhibit the Neon?" 
  On 23 October, the Tokyo Motor Show opened at the Makuhari 
Messe in Chiba. Since this was the thirtieth anniversary of the 
Motor Show, 352 firms from 15 nations of the world participated. 
It was the world's largest automobile show with an estimated 
number of visitors exceeding two million, but on the "Press Day" 
that was held in advance of general admission, the attention of 
the mass media was focussed on this one point. 
  That is probably only natural. The Neon, on which Chrysler 
staked its fortune, is the strategic model developed last year 
by that company. And Chrysler has realized a miraculous 
comeback. Although a small car, it has the power of a medium 
size car class with an engine displacement of 2,000 cc and 132 
horsepower. More threatening than anything else to Japanese 
makers is the fact that the sales price of the standard type 
equipped with both driver and passenger side airbags is thought 
to almost certainly be about $9,000, so it is less than the 
expensive $10,000 level. 
  Unfortunately, exhibition of the Neon was delayed, but even 
so the topic of discussion was concentrated on U.S. cars. The 
amount of attention given to the all-important Japanese cars was 
lower than expected. 
  The thing about the U.S. side that is attracting this much 
attention from mass media-related people is more than anything 
the recovery of competitiveness by U.S. cars. Actually, in the 
past two years, the power relationship between Japan and the 
U.S. has changed completely. 
  "The idea of U.S. cars being prone to breakdowns has fallen 
by the wayside long ago. GM, Ford and Chrysler, through joint 
venture projects with Toyota, Mazda and Mitsubishi, 
respectively, have steadily improved productivity and quality. 
On the other had, Japanese cars have too much quality so that 
U.S. cars are superior in terms of price performance ratio," 
says an industry source. 
  Particularly remarkable is the drop in price competitiveness 
[of Japanese cars] in the U.S. market. On the Japanese side, 
models in the same class are from $2,000 to $2,500 more 
expensive than their U.S. counterparts--a result of raising 
prices to deal with the strong yen. In the lower price car 
market of under $10,000 where the Japanese side was once 
unrivaled , U.S. cars like GM's Cavalier and Ford's Escort are 
holding top place. 
  For that reason, the market share (consisting of the total 
which are produced locally in the U.S. as well as export cars) 
in the U.S. passenger car market in 1991 and 1992 in excess of 
30 percent declined to 1.247 million units in the period from 
January to June, a 5 percent decrease over the same term of the 
previous year, and their share has also declined to 29.0 
percent. In July to September the share recovered somewhat, but, 
says our industry source, "that was transitory because beginning 
in October there was a sale to clear out inventories prior to 
the introduction of 1994 models," so the probability is high 
that "it will drop again after October." 
<H5>  The Sudden Improvement in Business Results on the U.S. Side </H5>
  Of course, "This doesn't mean that the Japanese makers have 
lost," says Honda Motor Company President Nobuhiko Kawamoto. 
"Japanese makers have stepped onto the same playing field as a 
result of the U.S. side improving quality, marketability and 
productivity." However, there some question whether there are 
any firms that have enough power to compete amid a situation 
where everything is against them in the sense that, according to 
Mazda President Yoshihiro Wada, "The strong yen slump this time 
is much more serious than last time. We cannot get a clue as to 
how to keep afloat in both the domestic and import markets." 
  Actually, the gap in results between Japanese and U.S. has 
widened further. 
  Chrysler posted a net profit of $720 million in fiscal 1992. 
Its LH car and Jeep Cherokee are performing favorably, and in 
the current fiscal 1993 it will renew its record for highest 
profits. Also, Ford, which was in the red last year is having 
good sales of the Taurus and F-Series truck, and will convert to 
a surplus this year. Even GM, which is continuing its tough 
battle, is embarking on large-scale restructuring, beginning 
such things as cutting its employees by 100,000, closing 21 
plants, among other things. 
  Meanwhile, what about Japanese makers? In fiscal 1992 Nissan 
Motor and Daihatsu Motor Co. ran their first current deficit 
since going public at 26.2 billion yen and 4.4 billion yen, 
respectively. Even in this fiscal year of 1993, there is a very 
good possibility that Nissan, Mazda, Fuji Heavy Industries, 
Isuzu Motor and others will post current deficits. 
  Even the balance sheet of Toyota Motor, which is the largest 
and mightiest in Japan's manufacturing industry, showed 
wide-margin declines in profits in the June term of 1993 of a 
current profit of 286.4 billion yen (off 24 percent compared to 
the previous term). It is certain that even in the June term of 
1994, total sales will be 8.7 trillion yen (down 24 percent over 
the previous term), and a current profit of 200 billion yen 
(down 30 percent) to give it the first decline in earnings and 
profits in seven years. In terms of operating profits, the first 
half will be 10.0 billion yen and the second half 60.0 billion 
yen, making 70.0 billion yen for the entire period (down 32 
percent), and if the exchange rate for first half were to have a 
strong yen in excess of 110 yen per dollar, there is even a high 
likelihood that it will post an operating deficit in the 
intermediate December 1993 term. 
  Even viewed in the middle to long term, the numerical 
inferiority of the Japanese makers cannot be denied. The export 
market which had once played a leading role, peaking in 1985 at 
6.73 million units, has continued on a decline. In 1993 between 
January and August, sales numbered 3.195 million units, a 5.1 
percent decline compared to the same term of the previous year. 
It is certain that for the entire year, sales will fall below 
the 5.5 million unit level for the first time since 1979. In the 
future as well, says our industry source, it appears that with 
the strong yen at the nearly 100 yen per dollar level, "it will 
not be possible to compete with the U.S. and Europe." 
  Hope is not to be found even in the domestic market which 
had 
been the motive force in the 1988 to 1990 period. Sales of 
registered cars which had been a mainstay in March of this year 
were slightly higher than the previous year's results at 706,000 
units, but from April on the decline over previous years will 
become established once again. Cumulative unit sales from 
January to September were 3.766 million units, a decline of 
eight percent compared with the same period of the previous 
year. If the recession continues even into the October to 
December period, not only will it be the first three year 
consecutive negative growth, but it will drop under the five 
million unit level for the first time since 1987. 
  Even including light automobiles for which demand is 
relatively firm, unit sales numbers from January to September 
were 4.967 million units, a seven percent decrease over the same 
period of the previous year. For the entire year, too, sales 
stopped at 6.50 million units (down seven percent compared to 
last year) which is as much as a 16 percent decline compared to 
the peak in 1990 of 7.776 million units. There are many with the 
view that a quick recovery cannot be expected even during 1994. 
  In the future as well, since, according to Chairman 
Kenichiro 
Ueno of the Japan Automobile Sales Association, "growth is 
finished, and, as in the United States and Europe, the market 
has become such that new car sales are influenced by the ups and 
downs of the economy," there is no way one can expect anything 
like a replay of the bubble period. 
<H5>  Overseas Production Still Cannot Become Independent </H5>
  The only possible way to get themselves out of the slump in 
domestic sales and exports and their reduced competitiveness in 
the U.S. and European markets, is to promote overseas production 
and localization more than has been the case up to now. In fact, 
all the Japanese makers have clearly been shifting overseas, but 
in some cases this has a danger of becoming a double edged sword. 
  The first one to take the initiative was Honda Motor Co. 
This 
September, it decided to move production of its Civic for export 
to the U.S. from its Suzuka Plant in Mie Prefecture to Honda of 
America (HAM) for local production targeted for April of 1994. 
Further, it has begun studying the prospect of transferring 
production of its U.S. best-seller Accord from its Sayama Plan 
in Saitama to HAM by the spring of 1996. 
  Also, at the beginning of October, Fuji Heavy Industries 
decided to move production of its Legacy for export to the U.S. 
to its joint venture subsidiary with Isuzu, Subaru Isuzu 
Automotive (SIA). The idea, according to Fuji Heavy Industries 
President Isamu Kawai, is that "we will halt export from Japan 
by the spring of 1994 when we will switch to a new type of 
Legacy in the US. Next year we will raise the monthly production 
from the currently declining production at SIA of 3,700 units to 
5,000 units." 
  In addition, Toyota decided in mid-October to produce its 
new 
3,000 to 4,000 cc luxury car Avalon at the Toyota Motor 
Manufacturing USA (TMMU) No. 2 plant. 
  The question, however, is when these shifts to overseas 
production will become profitable and whether they can achieve 
independence. 
  In the United States, subsequent to Honda Motor beginning 
local production at HAM in 1982, Nissan, Toyota, Mazda, 
Mitsubishi Motors, Fuji Heavy Industries/Isuzu managed to locate 
overseas one after another.. 
  Currently, the annual capacity of the Japanese makers as a 
whole totals 2.14 million units, with Honda's HAM at 510,000; 
Nissan's NMMC at 450,000 units; Toyota's TMMU at 240,000; 
Toyota's and GM's joint venture subsidiary New United Motor 
Manufacturing (NUMMI) at 300,000; Mazda's and Ford's joint 
venture subsidiary Auto Alliance International (AAI) at 240,000; 
Mitsubishi's Diamond Motors (DSM) at 240,000; and Fuji Heavy 
Industries/Isuzu's SIA at 160,000 units. Next spring when TMMU's 
No. 2 plant (annual production capacity 200,000 units) begins 
operations, that figure will reach 2.34 million units. 
  Moreover, if Canada's Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada 
(TMMC), Honda Canada, Suzuki and GM joint venture subsidiary 
CAMI Automotive, Mexico Nissan are included, annual production 
in North America as a whole would be 2.775 million units. Next 
spring it will reach 2.975 million units and then 3.0 million 
units. 
  Meanwhile, in Europe as well, subsequent to Nissan beginning 
local production in 1986 at Nissan Motors United Kingdom (NMUK), 
Honda Motor's Honda of UK Manufacturing (HUM), Toyota's Toyota 
Motor Manufacturing UK (TMUK), Mitsubishi with the establishment 
of Netherlands Car with Sweden's Volvo, located there. 
  Currently, annual production capacity in Europe is about 
500,000 units, including Isuzu and Suzuki's joint venture base. 
However, this will end up being close to 1.0 million units in 
1995 when HUM, TMUK and Netherlands begin full production. 
  The domestic annual production capacity of Japanese 
automakers with their total of 11 companies is 14.5 million 
units. Local production capacity in the U.S. alone is 20 percent 
of the domestic capacity, and in 1995 the U.S. and Europe will 
total 4.0 million units, reaching nearly 30 percent of domestic 
capacity. However, according to Mazda President Wada, only 
"Toyota and Honda in the U.S. can be said to have succeeded in 
overseas production." The actual situation is that it is 
difficult to say that Nissan and the other makers have achieved 
results in accord with initial plans. 
<H5>  The Sudden Swell in Interest Bearing Debt </H5>
  In fact, even if one looks at the operation rate, the only 
ones among the U.S. bases in the past two years that are higher 
than 90 percent are Toyota's TMMU, NUMMI and TMMC. Last year, 
because the Accord of Honda Motor's HAM, which had maintained 90 
percent operation, had reached the end of its model year, the 
cumulative January through September total production number was 
275,000 units, and its operation rate was down at 77 percent. 
  Earnings-wise an even more serious situation is continuing. 
The details are sketchy since none of the companies clarifies 
the results of their U.S. production subsidiaries, but even at 
Toyota's TMMU, according to our industry source, "since there is 
a repetition of either deficit or surplus depending on the 
fiscal year, they cannot be described as having become 
completely independent." Conversion to a surplus in fiscal year 
1991 and the idea of wiping out accumulated debt in fiscal year 
1993 which were planned at time of penetration have gotten way 
off track. 
  Even the earnings of Nissan's NMMC worsened due to 
investment 
in Altima production last year. Mitsubishi's DSM, Mazda's and 
Ford's AAI, as usual, could not be said to have established 
surplus-generating constitutions. Also, Fuji Heavy Industries' 
and Isuzu's SIA was able to convert to a surplus in the previous 
fiscal year, but the deficit of Fuji Heavy Industries' U.S. 
sales company, Subaru of America (SOA) has expanded due to the 
sales slump and has become a burden for Fuji Heavy Industries 
which is in the process of rebuilding. 
  Meanwhile, with regard to European bases, Nissan's Motor 
Iberia and Suzuki's Santana Motor were also in the red in fiscal 
year 1992 due to the recession in Spanish markets. Even Nissan's 
NMUK which had continued full production until this summer, 
revised downward this year's production plan from 270,000 units 
to 246,000 units due to the stagnant European market and in 
November will begin a day shift only system instead of a two 
shift day and night system. 
  This investment in overseas local plants and worsening of 
results is inviting a rapid deterioration of their financial 
constitutions. 
  The interest bearing debt of the five largest companies of 
Toyota, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Honda Motor and Mazda combined on a 
consolidated base was 8.9 trillion yen at the end of fiscal 
1992. This has grown to as much as three times the amount as 
compared to the end of fiscal 1986 which was prior to local 
production getting under full swing in the U.S. and Europe. 
Further, when Fuji Heavy Industries and Isuzu are included, that 
figure increases to 10 trillion yen. 
  Noticeably worsening among them are Nissan and Honda Motor. 
Last year Nissan conducted investment to increase production for 
Altima at NMMC and Micra (Japanese name Machi) at NMUK, so its 
amount of interest bearing debt increased sharply from 1.2 
trillion yen at the end of fiscal 1986 to 3.79 trillion yen. 
Honda Motor, which also had a mere 280 billion yen at the end of 
fiscal 1986 increased by four times due to such things as 
expansion of its HAM No. 2 plant and sales bases, expanding 
rapidly to 1.15 trillion yen. 
  Furthermore, Toyota, due to investment in TMMU No. 2 plant, 
TMMC, and TMUK, sharply increased its debt by sixfold to 2.26 
trillion yen compared to the amount in fiscal 1986. When viewed 
in a consolidated fashion, it has totally lost the image which 
was once described as "The Bank of Toyota." 
  If overseas production remains unable to become independent, 
it is certain that recovery of competitiveness in the U.S. 
market will be difficult. If the desperate battle of overseas 
projects continues in this way, it could, in fact, become a drag 
on Japan itself. 
<H5>  Restructuring Essential for Revival </H5>
  Japanese automakers are hardly standing by idly faced by 
these tough conditions domestically and abroad. On the one hand 
they have been restraining equipment investment from 1991 to 
1992 when slow business results became serious and have been 
making more active requests for price reductions to parts 
makers. They are also making more cost reductions on cars 
themselves by cutting the number of parts used, using parts 
commonly, etc. 
  Meanwhile, there is a rise in activity, says Nissan Motor 
President Tsuji, in the direction of "mutual OEM in which models 
are introduced from other companies in areas of one's weakness 
and for unprofitable models with a view to curtailing 
development funds." 
  At the end of last year, Honda Motor and Isuzu, the latter 
of 
which decided to withdraw from passenger cars, agreed to mutual 
supply of Honda's passenger car Domani and Isuzu's recreational 
vehicle (RV) Rodeo and Miu. In October, they decided to expand 
the range of OEM to include both companies' leading models: 
Honda's passenger car Accord and Isuzu's RV Big Horn. 
  Further, Nissan and Mazda, also in October formally resolved 
to conduct mutual OEM of Nissan's commercial vehicle AD van and 
Mazda's commercial vehicles, the Bongo van and Bongo truck. 
  Also, there are more moves being made toward downsizing by 
decreasing the number of personnel and such. In February of this 
year Nissan announced its business structure reform plan that 
included the closing of its Zama plant, and determined that it 
would cut its employees by 5,000 by the end of fiscal 1995. 
Further, Honda and Mazda launched wide-ranging rationalization. 
  By the end of fiscal 1995 Honda Motor, with the aim of 
creating a constitution that would be profitable with domestic 
production of 1.0 million units, will compress to a total of 
3,000 people its employees at Honda Technological Research 
Institute (in charge of product development) and Honda 
Engineering (responsible for production engineering). Mazda 
targets the end of fiscal 1995 to cut 2,000 people from its 
indirect divisions and 1,000 people from its direct divisions 
for a total of 3,000 people. Simultaneous to that, it will 
reinforce its assistance to sales companies and plants. 
  However, there is some question as to whether these measures 
alone will provide enough of a recovery of competitiveness to 
contend with the U.S. manufacturers. Even their cuts in 
personnel have stopped with natural attrition and reduced hiring 
and, according to our industry source, there is a danger that 
"they will get behind in rationalization compared to the U.S. 
and European sides, who are conducting bold layoffs and plant 
closings." 
  Even on the production aspect, on the U.S. side GM with its 
Saturn and Chrysler with the Jefferson plant are successively 
starting up new and better plants. Meanwhile, many of the plants 
of the Japanese automakers, with the exception of a few, such as 
Toyota Motor's Kyushu plant, Nissan's Kyushu No. 2 plant, 
Mazda's Bofu No. 2 plant and others, were constructed between 
1955 to 1965, and they could hardly be described as adequate in 
terms of productivity. 
  At present, moreover, the domestic annual production 
capacity 
of Japanese automakers is around 14.5 million units for the 
total of 11 companies. Since production this year is certain to 
fall to 11.5 million units (a decline over the previous year of 
eight percent), the rate of operation will be 79 percent. The 
gap in supply and demand between capacity and production will 
reach as much as 3.0 million units. 
  For Japanese automakers to compete with the U.S. and 
Europeans, according to Toyota Motors Senior Managing Director 
Eiichi Kumabe, "it is vital to build an organic system of 
international division of labor with a more global view in order 
to know what to build and where to sell it." If automakers 
continue to carry excess production capacity domestically, it 
could become a heavy burden to future development overseas. 
<H5>  The Focus on Nissan and Mazda </H5>
  Among the automakers, the main focus is on Nissan Group and 
Mazda whose worsening business results are the most conspicuous. 
  In the case of Nissan Group, it is certain that Nissan 
itself 
will have an operating deficit in excess of 40.0 billion yen in 
fiscal 1993 also, continuing the trend started in fiscal 1992. 
And although it will depend on profits from the sale of 
securities, there is even the possibility that it could have a 
two consecutive year current deficit. Fuji Heavy Industries, 
which in fiscal 1992 had realized its first conversion to a 
current surplus in three years, reverted back to a current 
deficit of approximately 10.0 billion yen in fiscal 1993 due to 
the strong yen and Nissan Diesel, which had taken on the bus and 
truck division, posted its first deficit in six years with a 
current loss of 4.3 billion yen, so there is a strong 
probability that there will be no dividend payment. 
  Just Nissan alone has an annual production capacity of 2.6 
million units domestically and 1.3 million units in the U.S. and 
Europe for a total of 3.9 million units (3.6 million units in 
the spring of 1995 after closing the Zama plant). Meanwhile, 
its domestic sales are 1.126 million units and 1.687 units 
abroad for a total of 2.817 million units (on a fiscal 1992 
consolidated base), so the gap with production capacity is 1.0 
million units. That gap will widen further because of the severe 
recession in the domestic and European markets in fiscal 1993. 
  Currently, Nissan is conducting consignment production 
(annual production: 60,000 units) of the Pulsar for Fuji Heavy 
Industries, but the actual situation is that "we don't have the 
strength to assist any further," says Nissan's President Tsuji. 
According to our industry source, there is ample possibility 
that the Nissan Group, which includes Fuji Heavy Industries and 
Nissan Diesel, will "initiate a major restructuring effort with 
large margin personnel reductions, plant closings, and the like." 
  On the other hand, Mazda's troubles continue as well. The 
sales slump in Japan and Europe and strong yen which have 
greatly exceeded expectations have led to an increase from 13.0 
billion yen which was forecast at the start of the term to 32.0 
billion yen in the current deficit, so it will not be paying 
dividends for the first time since going public. Rumors such as 
"Sumitomo Bank will launch large-scale assistance" and "it will 
become Ford's plant in Japan" have not gone away despite the 
desperate denials of Mazda's management. 
  It will attempt to rebuild by its own power by way of 
personnel cuts, revision of the ratio of direct and indirect 
[divisions] and making its plants more efficient, but, according 
to Mazda President Wada, "We understand that these measures 
alone will not suffice, but there are not enough good ideas for 
high yen and recession countermeasures. What is clear is that 
proceeding with rationalization by acceleration" alone is 
precarious. 
  This is not to suggest that Honda and Toyota have any 
breathing room. Toyota's annual production capacity, when one 
adds Toyota Motor Kyushu that started full operation this fall 
and related manufacturers as well as Toyota Auto Body Co.'s new 
plant, domestically alone is 4.74 million units, so there is a 
gap approaching 1.0 million units. 
  Production on the No. 3 line of the Tahara plant in Aichi 
Prefecture that produced the Celcio was suspended beginning in 
January of this year. Further, in the three month period from 
September to December, it will dispatch 175 production personnel 
of the Motomachi plant to Toyota Auto Body, but it is 
questionable whether these types of measures alone will be 
adequate for it to ride out this recession. 
  Honda Motor also began stronger production coordination 
since 
the end of last year. In addition to going to a single shift 
system on its No. 2 line at its Suzuka plant in October, it is 
also advancing with the transfer of production of its AT Mission 
from its Kumamoto and Hamamatsu plants. The only Japanese 
automaker that is doing well is Mitsubishi Motor whose RVs are 
performing favorably. 
  At the time of the first and second oil crises, Japanese 
automakers achieved a quick recovery by getting the jump on U.S. 
and European makers, using exports as a fulcrum. At the time of 
the previous strong yen downturn, they received the benefits of 
the bubble economy in which domestic demand grew sharply. This 
time, however, not only is there no prospect of an export or 
domestic market, there is also a strong rival in the form of the 
U.S. side, which has recovered its competitiveness. 
  Osamu Suzuki, president of Suzuki who has developed his own 
management style by taking the initiative in local production in 
developing countries like India and China and in its partnership 
with GM, says, "It is unavoidable that the domestic situation 
will become devoid of substance in this recession. In order to 
survive, we will have to throw away face as well as our pride 
and do whatever it takes." 
  There is a very strong possibility that in the future, there 
will loom the spectacle of automakers being faced with 
restructuring and closings of domestic plants or having to 
withdraw from U.S. and European markets. In order to keep the 
prosperity of the 1980's from ending as a mere fleeting dream, 
it will be necessary to discard one's pride.
