  [Text] The operating licence of foreign fishing boats in 
Aceh waters should be revoked because they often violate 
existing regulations, including the clause banning them from 
operating within 12 miles from the coast. Colonel Rudi 
Supriatna, commander of 012 Military Area Command, said Thai 
trawlers flying Indonesian flags, who operate in the western 
Aceh waters, often violate this clause. 
  The commander, who was aboard the Indonesian Navy's Nomad 
plane along with Navy Commodore Widodo, commander of the Western 
Fleet's Naval Combat Group, made an inspection tour of western 
Aceh waters today. During the inspection tour, they found three 
foreign fishing boats in (Calang) waters, western Aceh, at about 
156 km west of Banda Aceh and they were operating within 12 
miles from the coast. Another violation committed by the 
trawlers was the use of drift nets, which are capable of 
catching all types of fish.

  [Text] Washington, Jan. 25 KYODO -- Japan and the United 
States ended two days of high-level talks Tuesday without 
agreement on how to craft a trade accord that is critical to the 
upcoming February 11 summit between Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton. 
  "Our discussions with our Japanese counterparts yesterday 
and 
today did not produce agreement," a somber-faced senior U.S. 
official told reporters after the talks. The official, who did 
not want to be identified, said any agreement with Tokyo must 
contain provisions "of substantial opening of the Japanese 
market along with objective criteria to assess progress toward 
that goal." 
  Japanese and U.S. officials are supposed to draw up a 
progress report on the framework trade negotiations by the time 
Hosokawa and Clinton meet February 11 in Washington. 
  U.S. officials reiterated that "objective criteria" are 
essential for defining a new framework of trade relations with 
Japan, which runs a 50 billion dollar trade surplus with the 
United States. "If there are no objective criteria, there is no 
agreement," a senior U.S. official said. 
  Members of the Japanese negotiating team, headed by Deputy 
Foreign Minister Koichiro Matsuura, acknowledged that the U.S. 
insistence on quantifying the openness of the Japanese markets 
reflects a "lack of trust" between the two trading partners. 
  Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice trade minister for international 
affairs and a key member of the Japanese negotiating team, said 
he feels the U.S. negotiators "understand Japanese reasoning" 
for opposing import targets but still want to use indicators to 
quantify the openness of Japan's markets. 
  U.S. officials contend that past agreements by Tokyo to 
lower 
trade barriers have failed to produce the desired results. The 
U.S. wants Japan to accept the import levels of other 
industrialized countries as benchmarks to prove that its markets 
are truly open to foreign goods. 
  Japanese officials say Japan will oppose the use of any 
indicators, arguing that governments in market economies have no 
power to dictate the level of imports for specific industries. 
  Speaking at a news conference Tuesday, Japan's Ambassador to 
the U.S. Takakazu Kuriyama called the U.S. expectations of 
predetermined market shares "unrealistic" in market economies. 
  "The United States should understand that putting up a 
certain quantitative goal and trying to achieve it isn't 
something that can happen in the real business world," he said. 
  Kuriyama, who is due to fly back to Tokyo Sunday for 
consultations ahead of the Clinton-Hosokawa summit, urged 
Washington not to "lose sight" of the principal purpose of the 
framework agreement -- how to make the Japanese market more open 
to foreign goods and services. 
  The framework accord, concluded last July, calls for a 
"highly significant decrease" in Japan's current account surplus 
and promised "tangible progress" in the access and sales of 
foreign goods in the Japanese market. 
  The two governments designated the Japanese automobile 
market, insurance, and Japanese Government procurement in 
telecommunications and medical equipment as priority areas that 
must be settled by the February 11 summit meeting. 
  U.S. officials said the two sides have reached a "complete 
impasse" on negotiations involving the auto industry sector and 
described progress on Japanese Government procurement and the 
insurance market as "marginal." 
  Japanese and U.S. officials are scheduled to hold more 
working-level talks this week in Washington, but there is no 
agreement yet on a further round of senior-level talks prior to 
the summit meeting. 
  U.S. officials said the Japanese side has proposed another 
round of high-level talks in Tokyo but the U.S. Government will 
have further consultations before deciding on the next move. 
"We intend to do all that we can between now and February 11 in 
anticipation of a successful summit," a senior U.S. official 
said. 
  But the official added, "in our view, we would prefer not to 
have agreements than to have bad and cosmetic ones."

  [Excerpts] Washington, Jan. 25 KYODO -- Japan and the 
United States Tuesday [25 January] wound up three days of 
high-level talks on the so-called "framework" trade accord but 
apparently made little headway on the critical issue of how to 
measure progress of foreign access to Japanese markets. 
  Japanese officials who took part in the day's meeting said 
the Japanese side has proposed another round of meetings early 
next month in Tokyo. 
  U.S. officials declined to make any comments as they emerged 
from a two-hour session held at the White House conference 
center. 
  U.S. and Japanese officials have scheduled separate 
briefings 
on the framework trade talks at 6 P.M. (8 A.M. Wednesday Japan 
time). 
  The two sides are supposed to draw up a progress report by 
the time Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa meets with 
President Bill Clinton on February 11 in Washington. 
  But both U.S. and Japanese officials have admitted they are 
still divided on how to interpret the meaning of "objective 
criteria," the most contentious provision incorporated in the 
framework accord which the two countries concluded last July. 
"There is no movement at all from the Japanese side," said 
Marcus Noland, a senior economist at the White House Council of 
Economic Advisers and a member of the U.S. negotiating team. 
  While saying there are problems "in all areas" of trade 
issues identified in the framework agreement, Noland singled out 
Japan's macroeconomic policy and access to the Japanese auto 
market as the "most difficult" confronting U.S. negotiators. 
  Members of the Japanese negotiating team, headed by Deputy 
Foreign Minister Koichiro Matsuura, "are just repeating over and 
over" their positions, Noland said. [passage omitted] 
  Japanese officials say Japan will oppose the use of any 
indicators, arguing that governments in market economies have no 
power to dictate the level of imports for specific industries.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 26 KYODO -- The government proposed 
Wednesday raising to 330 million yen the amount of compensation 
to residents who have sued over high noise levels at U.S. Yokota 
Air Base in on the outskirts of Tokyo. 
  The proposal, submitted in writing to the Tokyo high court 
by 
officials of the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, is 50 
million yen more than the government's original proposal. 
  The figure is still some 300 million yen short of the amount 
of compensation suggested by the Tokyo high court in a 
compromise proposal, however. 
  Restrictions on night flights sought by the residents were 
also not a part of the compromise agreement but were 
incorporated into a nonbinding preamble to the proposal. 
  Hundreds of residents living near the Yokota base filed the 
joint action suit against the government demanding compensation 
and a ban on night flights. 
  In March 1989, the Hachioji Branch of the Tokyo District 
Court rejected the residents' demands for a ban on night flights 
and compensation for future disturbances. But it ordered the 
government to pay 330 million yen in compensation for past 
victimization. 
  Both sides then appealed the ruling, but have been in 
negotiations since June following a Supreme Court decision in 
February 1993 rejecting a ban on night flights and compensation 
for future noise disturbances in two earlier noise pollution 
suits. 
  In November, the Tokyo high court sought a compromise by 
proposing an end to the night flights "in principle." 
  Japan and the U.S. have agreed that flights and ground 
activities at the base between 10 P.M. and 6 A.M. should be 
restricted to those that are essential to the U.S. military's 
operations.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 26 KYODO -- A top Russian aerospace 
official appealed Wednesday for bilateral cooperation with Japan 
in the aerospace sector. 
  Edward S. Neymark [spelling of name as received], chief of 
the aircraft industry department at the Russian Federation State 
Committee for Defense Industries, said such cooperation would 
benefit both countries. 
  The Russian aerospace industry is faced with an urgent need 
to convert to commercial use due to military spending cuts. 
  Neymark was speaking at a press conference in a Tokyo hotel 
after meeting officials in charge of aircraft manufacturing at 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. 
  Neymark said he told MITI officials that Russia is ready to 
cooperate with Japan in any aerospace field ranging from 
electronic parts to joint development of a 600-seat passenger 
airliner. 
  The Russian official is visiting Japan following a 
memorandum 
signed last May between the Japanese and Russian aerospace 
industries to promote bilateral relations and personnel 
exchanges.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 26 KYODO -- Japan and Russia ended 
three days of aviation talks Wednesday with an agreement to open 
two new routes between the two countries, the Transport Ministry 
said. 
  The accord allows each nation's airlines to operate flights 
between the northern Japanese city of Aomori and the Russian Far 
East city of Khabarovsk and between the central Japanese city of 
Toyama and the Russian Far East city of Vladivostok, ministry 
officials said. 
  Under the agreement, Russia's Aeroflot Airline plans to run 
two weekly flights on both routes as soon as related customs, 
immigration and quarantine facilities are set up at the Japanese 
airports, they said. 
  The first flight between Aomori and Khabarovsk is expected 
as 
early as fiscal 1996 and that between Toyama and Vladivostok is 
expected in fiscal 1994, they said. 
  No Japanese airlines reportedly plan to serve the two routes 
at the moment. 
  The agreement also calls for raising the number of weekly 
flights between Niigata and Vladivostok to three from the 
current two starting in fiscal 1994, the officials said. 
  The two countries also agreed to hold a meeting in Tokyo of 
Russian and Japanese aviation controllers to improve related 
technical skills. 
  During the talks, Russian officials assured Japan that the 
current restriction on trans-Siberian flights will be lifted as 
early as March, the officials said. 
  Because of a lack of necessary aviation control equipment, 
Russia has limited the number of trans-Siberian flights to six 
per hour.

  [Text] Naha, Jan. 26 KYODO -- A warning shot was fired 
Tuesday [25 January] night at a Panamanian-registered ship in 
the East China Sea as 15 Chinese-speaking men with weapons 
boarded and inspected the vessel, the Maritime Safety Agency 
[MSA] said Wednesday. 
  The MSA said the incident took place about 60 kilometers 
northwest of Okinawa Prefecture's Iheya-Jima Island. 
  The 926-ton Nanshin Maru, a freezer cargo vessel, was 
boarded 
by the 15 men from another ship, MSA officials said. 
  One of the men said in Chinese that they were checking the 
ship as part of measures to keep tabs on unlawful trade between 
China and Taiwan, the officials said. 
  The man also told a Japanese crew member and others of the 
Nanshin Maru that he was sorry for the trouble the surprise 
check had caused, they said. 
  Japanese maritime authorities said that between March 1992 
and December 1993 they logged 75 cases of warning shots, 
quarantine inspections and tailings in the East China Sea. 
China has acknowledged that its patrol ships were involved in 
three cases. 
  Japanese officials said Japan will check the latest episode 
with the Chinese Government.

  [Text] Nagasaki, Jan. 21 Kyodo -- Two chartered Vietnam 
Airlines flights carrying 262 Vietnamese refugees departed 
Friday [21 January] from Nagasaki for Hanoi as part of the 
voluntary repatriation plan of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR]. 
  One of the flights departed Friday morning but did not 
receive permission from the Chinese Government to land in 
Shanghai en route and was forced to return to Nagasaki. 
  The flight's routing was changed to go via Taipei and both 
flights departed around 7 P.M. 
  A total of 263 Vietnamese refugees had been scheduled to be 
repatriated, but one withdrew a request to return to Hanoi prior 
to Friday's departure. 
  The refugees had arrived in Japan by boat between November 
1989 and October 1993 and were being held in the detention 
center and a temporary reception center in Omura, Nagasaki 
Prefecture. 
  The Geneva-based UNHCR returned about 200 Vietnamese from 
Japan to their home country under a voluntary repatriation 
scheme last year.

  [Text] Hiroshima, Jan. 22 KYODO -- A senior Cambodian

and his own nation must not happen again. 
  Sieng Kimhoun [spelling of name as received], director of 
the

for October's Asian Games and said he hoped to return to Japan 
during the games. 
  "I cannot find the words to adequately express how I feel

Sieng. 
  "We and the people of Hiroshima have a saying in common that 
this must never happen again," said Sieng, referring to the 1945 
atomic bombing of Hiroshima and the Pol Pot reign of terror in 
Cambodia during which an estimated two million people were 
killed and Sieng himself was forced to labor for four years. 
  Visiting most of the sites for the October 2-16 Asian Games, 
Sieng said he hoped they would contribute to world peace. 
  Cambodia plans to send its first delegation in 16 years to 
Asia's quadrennial multisport event.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in 
Japanese at 2332 GMT on 22 January, in its regularly scheduled 
"News 2001" program, carries a live interview with former Prime 
Minister Toshiki Kaifu of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). 
  The program begins with a brief introduction of Kaifu as the 
man who holds the key to whether the LDP stays together or 
further breaks up with tension expected to mount between LDP 
groups having differing views on the political reform bills as a 
result of the rejection of the bills in the upper house of the 
Diet on 21 January. The program also seeks to have Kaifu explain 
what he has in mind to have the bills enacted during the current 
Diet session. 
  Asked what he feels was the greatest cause of the defeat of 
the political reform bills in the upper house, Kaifu says 
although ruling coalition parties and the opposition LDP held 
last minute talks to reach a compromise, they failed. He 
stresses: "They should have tried to move just one step closer 
to arriving at a compromise." 
  Regarding the reemergence of arguments that the political 
reform bills be treated separately and that bills on preventing 
political corruption be taken up first, Kaifu points out that 
past efforts at preventing political corruption have been 
unsuccessful. He says that the LDP worked out its political 
reform outline during his term as prime minister. Bringing out 
papers on which the outline has been laid out, he explains that 
the current election system is at the root of political 
corruption. He says a problem can only be solved by attacking 
it at its roots, not just at its limbs, citing a college 
professor under whom he once studied. He thus asserts the 
political reform bills should be taken up as a single package. 
  Kaifu then points out that since the parties which formerly 
opposed the LDP political reform outline are now agreeing to 
bills which basically agree in principle with this outline, the 
LDP should also try to move toward a compromise. He feels the 
ruling coalition parties and the LDP should work out a 
compromise and that he believes this can be done. He further 
points out that since the leaders of Sakigake (Harbinger) and 
Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) worked together with him in 
drafting the political reform outline, they should be well aware 
of the principles involved, and, therefore, things can be 
settled by holding a thorough discussion at a joint meeting of 
both houses of the Diet. 
  Asked how he would act in case the political reform bills 
were put to the vote again in the lower house, Kaifu says this 
is undesirable and unlikely since there is the option of working 
out a solution at a joint meeting of both houses. 
  Freelance commentator Kenichi Takemura says ruling coalition 
party officials should refrain from suggesting that the 
coalition is willing to accept the LDP-proposed bills "in whole" 
(marunomi) so that political reform bills can be enacted during 
the current Diet session. He warns they should be wary of using 
delicate terms which could decisively determine the fate of the 
political reform bills, pointing out the use of the term 
"marunomi" could anger many coalition members since it would 
offend their pride to accept the opposition's proposals. 
  At 2341 GMT, Hirotaka Akamatsu, secretary general of the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), is called up via remote 
hookup to comment on what has been said so far in Kaifu's 
interview. He says it is the responsibility of all politicians 
to have political reform brought about during the current Diet 
session, and, therefore, a compromise should be worked out at a 
joint meeting of both houses where representatives of the 
various parties will be present. 
  Asked to say a few words to Kaifu, Akamatsu points out that 
comments LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori made earlier in the 
program indicate that the LDP leadership wants to put off the 
political reform bills rather than work out a compromise at a 
joint meeting of both houses. He asks that Kaifu exercise his 
leadership to bring together pro-reformist LDP members for a 
joint cooperation toward bringing about political reform during 
the current Diet session. Akamatsu vows that he and his 
associates would do their best. 
  Kaifu is asked what he intends to do. He says immediately 
after the bills were rejected at the upper house, he and his 
associates held a discussion and decided to ask the LDP 
leadership to promptly take steps toward holding a joint meeting 
of both houses of the Diet to work out a compromise. He says 
this is necessary since Japan is in the midst of an economic 
slump and this matter also warrants immediate attention. He 
says as soon as a compromise is worked out on basic points, then 
the government can start working on other problems. 
  On reports that some LDP members plan to demand the 
resignation of the party leadership if it agrees to a joint 
meeting of both houses, Kaifu denounces such moves, saying that 
the party adopted its political reform outline in 1989 and has 
campaigned in subsequent elections with this outline as a party 
platform. He mentions that, at the time, he was the leader of a 
task force on political reform and current LDP President Yohei 
Kono was acting leader then. He says they both toured the 
country to explain the party's political reform outline. He 
says since this has been the party's platform, it is only proper 
that the party's leadership seek a compromise with the coalition 
that would bring the political reform bills as close to the 
party's proposals as possible. He says this can be accomplished 
by holding a joint meeting of both houses, and, therefore, it is 
improper to denounce the party leadership for agreeing to 
holding such a meeting. 
  Asked how he feels about some people calling for a top-level 
meeting between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and LDP 
President Kono to resolve the situation, Kaifu stresses the 
problem should be solved by holding a joint meeting of both 
houses to work out a compromise. 
  Regarding rumors that some junior members of his group may 
leave the LDP should the situation fail to be resolved, Kaifu 
says the Federation of Dietmen for Political Reform members have 
resolved to concentrate all their efforts now on political 
reform, not more and not less. 
  The interview concludes with Kaifu stating his continued 
determination to help bring about political reform, calling for 
utmost efforts by all politicians toward this end.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 26 KYODO -- Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura said Wednesday [26 January] he can neither 
confirm nor deny whether Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa might 
resign if he fails to secure Diet approval for political reform. 
Asked about an adviser's comment on the possible resignation of 
the Cabinet depending on the result of Diet debate on reform, 
the top government spokesman said, "I neither confirm nor deny 
that." 
  Shusei Tanaka, a special adviser to Hosokawa, said Tuesday 
the premier may disband the cabinet and step down if he fails to 
get the measures put into law. 
  Four bills to reform the system for elections to the House 
of 
Representatives and curb corruption in public life were defeated 
in the House of Councillors last Friday. They had cleared the 
lower house last November. 
  Hosokawa has staked his political fate on enactment of such 
measures by a self-imposed deadline of Saturday, when the 
current Diet session ends. To meet public expectations, ruling 
and opposition parties must do their utmost to ignore even major 
differences and accomplish a common goal of political reform, 
Takemura told a news conference. 
  The ruling coalition and the opposition camp begin 
negotiations Wednesday afternoon to work out a compromise reform 
plan and get it onto the statute books before the close of the 
Diet term. 
  Earlier Wednesday, the premier brushed aside speculation 
that 
he and his cabinet might resign, saying he has no plans to take 
such a step. 
  Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said 
Hosokawa should dissolve the lower house for a snap general 
election, rather than stepping down, if the political reform 
program fails to win parliamentary approval by Saturday. "I 
don't think the mass resignation of the cabinet is possible with 
such a high level of public support," he said. 
  Hata also ruled out the possibility of carrying the 
government reform proposals over to the next regular session of 
the Diet, which begins next Monday. 
  A government source said there is no consensus within the 
government about the resignation of the cabinet, adding that 
Tanaka was only expressing his personal views.

special aid Shusei Tanaka's 25 January remark; from "NHK News" 
program] 
  [Text] On the evening of 25 January, the prime minister's 
special aide, Shusei Tanaka, said Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa might resign if the Diet fails to enact the political 
reform bills. Commenting on this, Prime Minister Hosokawa told 
reporters this morning that he does not have any such intention. 
  On the issue, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura 
said 
at a news conference today: 
  When the prime minister takes responsibility, clear actions 
are either to dissolve the lower house or to resign en masse. 
Of these, Mr. Tanaka probably thought the cabinet's resignation 
is more likely. I personally have no opinion on that.

  [Text] Shusei Tanaka, special assistant to the prime 
minister, hinted last night at the possibility that if a package 
of political reform bills is not enacted in the Diet during its 
current session, the Hosokawa cabinet would resign en masse. 
Asked by reporters to comment on Mr. Tanaka's remark this 
morning at the prime minister's official residence, Prime 
Minister Hosokawa said there is no such possibility. 
  Commenting on Mr. Tanaka's remark at a news conference this 
morning, Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura said: As the clearest 
way for the prime minister to take political responsibility, he 
could dissolve the House of Representatives, call general 
elections and announce the resignation of his cabinet en masse. 
Mr. Tanaka probably anticipated the resignation of the Hosokawa 
cabinet en masse. I do not want to make any comment on his 
remark either way.

<F P=106> ["News Focus" by Kohei Murayama] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 26 KYODO -- Japan's financial and 
monetary authorities are losing their direction, with political 
confusion retarding budgetary schedules and reviving 
credit-easing hopes at a time when prompt action is needed for 
the flagging economy. 
  With the coalition government failing last Friday [21 
January] to pass its reform bills through the Diet's upper 
house, and with a Japan-U.S. summit in Washington only a couple 
of weeks away, financial authorities hope to draft a final plan 
for a third extra fiscal 1993 budget and the fiscal 1994 budget 
early next week before further political chaos sets in. 
  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) hopes the political situation 
"will change to allow various things as soon as possible," said 
Jiro Saito, vice finance minister and administrative head. 
  Six ministers responsible for economic affairs, including 
Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, have agreed to focus on 
reviving the political reform bills, stressing that passage 
would be the best help for the economy. 
  Fujii said a timetable for the budget is "not yet decided," 
but stressed the government will do its utmost to form a new 
economic stimulus package "after the current extraordinary Diet 
session ends on Saturday." 
  Both Fujii and Saito said the government has not mentioned a 
specific date for the budgets. But now that some party leaders 
are hinting at a dissolution of the lower house and cabinet 
resignation, the budgets and fiscal measures could be in for 
further delay. 
  But even if the cabinet survives for a transitional period 
to 
launch them, uncertainties remain over the crucial issue of 
cutting income tax to help jack up the economy. 
  Under these circumstances, attention is shifting to 
nonpolitical monetary authorities which have stayed on the 
sidelines since cutting the discount rate in September to an 
all-time low of 1.75 percent. 
  In his latest press remarks Wednesday, Bank of Japan 
Governor 
Yasushi Mieno said he is "concerned" about the political 
turmoil, but added it is too early to judge the economic effects 
of a "still fluid" situation. He said the economy "remains 
stagnant with no clear signs for recovery," while stressing he 
would continue to "carefully watch" the effects of past measures 
and political developments. 
  There is perhaps some optimism, however, beginning to spread 
among monetary authorities as Mieno said his branch managers 
reported at a meeting this week that corporate sentiment has 
"calmed down somewhat" though [it] is still weak. 
  Branch managers attributed the improving sentiment to a 
recent rally in stock prices, the halt in the yen's 
appreciation, and a positive restructuring stance. But all 
these are apparently based on expectations of imminent fiscal 
measures, and hopes for an immediate rate cut were rekindled on 
Monday when stock prices took their steepest dive in two years 
of over 900 points in the key Nikkei index of 225 selected 
issues. 
  The stock market remained stable after recovering slightly 
on 
Tuesday, and the currency market was not much affected by the 
political turmoil. 
  Along with concerns over the impact of delayed fiscal 
measures, market attention is now fixed on Japan-U.S. relations 
ahead of the February 11 summit. Fujii stressed the 
"importance" for Japan to explain its political and economic 
policies at the summit "in the sense of Japan-U.S. friendship." 
  Indeed, the government wants to see some tangible results at 
the summit, as Hosokawa and Fujii vowed to do their best in both 
economic measures and the ongoing "framework" trade talks when 
they met separately on Sunday with U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen. Fujii said that he told Bentsen to "trust us" and 
leave "the details" of the measures to Japan. 
  Bentsen said in press remarks after the meetings he had 
asked 
for measures to include an effective income tax cut, and 
stressed the United States would have to "reexamine" the 
bilateral trade talks if a reasonable agreement is not reached 
at the summit. 
  In Washington where subcabinet-level negotiations are now 
under way, U.S. Commerce secretary Ron Brown hinted at economic 
sanctions. That would mean a new round of sharp appreciation 
for the yen and a stock-price plunge, and the worst scenario for 
financial and monetary authorities would be that they could not 
prevent a further economic setback amid the continuing political 
confusion.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 26 KYODO -- A top business leader on 
Wednesday [26 January] called for early compromise on a 
political reform package so that the government can get down to 
the task of rebuilding Japan's economy. 
  Both the ruling coalition parties and the opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) should have been "more sensible" in 
discussions that led to last Friday's rejection by the House of 
the Councillors of the four political reform bills, said Takeshi 
Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers 
Associations (Nikkeiren). 
  If both parties fail to reach compromise by the end of the 
current Diet session Saturday and the bills are scrapped, 
Japan's international standing would be eroded substantially, 
Nagano told a lecture meeting sponsored by KYODO NEWS SERVICE. 
  The bills' scrapping is likely to spawn a sense of 
disappointment in industrial sectors across the nation, possibly 
putting added downward pressure on stock prices, a major gauge 
of the health of the Japanese economy, Nagano said. 
  He said he hopes "from the bottom of my heart" that the 
political reform package will pass the Diet through an early 
compromise at a joint committee of both chambers of the Diet. 
  The stalled discussion on political reforms has prevented 
the 
government from formulating a new economic stimulus package, a 
third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 to finance the 
package, and the main budget for fiscal 1994. 
  Turning to the coming spring wage negotiations with labor 
unions, Nagano reiterated the Nikkeiren policy decided earlier 
that it is virtually impossible for the management side to agree 
to a wage hike for workers. 
  In view of the unabated worsening of economic conditions, 
allowing a wage hike "easily" would endanger the maintenance of 
employment, so businesses should give their top priority to 
securing employment rather than hiking wages, he said. 
  The employment situation is deteriorating day by day, with 
the number of idled workers standing at an estimated one million 
to three million across the nation, he said. The actual jobless 
ratio may have reached 5 to 6 percent, a level seen in the 
United States and Europe, Nagano said. 
  It is "impossible" for management to agree to a 5 to 6 
percent wage increase for fiscal 1994, which was recently 
proposed by the Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo). He 
said nominal wage levels for Japanese workers are the highest in 
the world and they should give up a hike during the era of the 
economic slump. 
  In the United States, business performance is picking up due 
to drastic restructuring measures centering on a cut in 
personnel costs, he said, noting that U.S. real wage levels have 
dropped to those seen before 1960, after reaching a peak in 
1972. He said the government should focus on deregulating 
controls as a means to reduce Japan's consumer prices, also the 
highest in the world. Such a step would enhance the standard of 
living of the Japanese people, he said. 
  Nagano proposed anew that the government carry out an income 
tax cut of 10 trillion yen "as soon as possible" as a way to 
turn around the economy. 
  Raising the consumption tax to cover an income tax cut is 
not 
desirable in light of the current economic situation but if it 
is unavoidable, such a hike should be delayed to "substantially 
later," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 26 KYODO -- The ruling coalition 
parties decided Wednesday to offer a compromise on the 
government's reform bills to the opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP) at a joint council of both Diet houses later in the 
day, coalition sources said. On electoral reform, the 
compromise would allow 300 seats in the House of Representatives 
to be elected from single-seat constituencies and the remaining 
200 seats through the proportional representation system, 
according to the sources. 
  A political reform package submitted by the LDP and killed 
in 
the House of Representatives last November called for the lower 
house to have 300 seats from single-seat constituencies and 171 
elected through proportional representation. 
  The government-sponsored reform bills rejected by the House 
of Councillors last week called for 274 seats from single-seat 
constituencies and 226 through proportional representation. 
  Also, under the coalition's compromise plan, the 
proportional 
representation system will be based on 11 electoral divisions 
covering the whole country, the sources said. 
  The proportional representation system in the LDP package 
was 
based on the existing 47 prefectures and that proposed in the 
government-sponsored bills was based on a single national 
electoral district. 
  Concerning political fund-raising, the ruling parties' 
compromise plan allows some donations from companies and 
organizations to individual politicians, which was banned in the 
government package, the sources said. 
  The Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ], the largest party 
in the ruling coalition, was reluctant to agree to the loosening 
of the restriction on donations, they said. 
  The ruling parties proposed to the LDP to hold the joint 
council of both houses in a last-ditch effort to enact the bills 
by Saturday [29 January], when the Diet closes. 
  If two-thirds of the 20-member joint panel agree on a 
compromise plan, the amended version would then be sent to 
plenary sessions of both houses of the Diet for a vote. The 
bills would become law if passed by a majority vote of both the 
houses.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 26 KYODO -- The ruling coalition and 
opposition on Wednesday [26 January] failed to initiate any 
substantial talks on how to salvage the government-proposed 
political reform package at a meeting of the joint committee of 
both houses of the Diet, legislators said. 
  The panel, comprising 10 legislators each from the House of 
Representatives and the House of Councillors, held its first 
meeting after the lower house decided to set up the committee at 
a plenary session earlier in the day. 
  The last-ditch attempt to work out a compromise came after 
the upper chamber voted down the Hosokawa administration's 
reform package last Friday. A total of 20 Social Democratic 
Party dissidents helped the opposition reject the package. 
  The meeting ended after only 10 minutes, having elected 
Takushi Hirai, chief of Liberal Democratic Party upper house 
member, as chairman of the panel. It agreed to meet again 
Thursday afternoon. 
  If two-thirds of the 20-member joint panel agree on a 
compromise plan, the amended version would then be sent to 
plenary sessions of both houses of the Diet for a vote. The 
bills would become law if passed by a majority vote of both 
houses. 
  Meanwhile, the ruling coalition agreed to propose a 
compromise plan which increases the number of seats allocated 
for single-seat constituencies to 280 from the 
government-proposed 274 seats, reducing the number of seats for 
proportional representation from 226 to 220, coalition sources 
said. 
  The compromise plan would also allow legislators of 
prefectural and town assemblies to accept corporate donations. 
The government package prohibits individual politicians from 
receiving political donations from corporations, allowing only 
political parties to receive such donations. 
  Earlier in the day, the coalition worked out a different 
compromise version by which 300 single-seat districts would be 
created, while the remaining 200 proportional representation 
seats would be appropriated, they said. 
  That version, compiled at a meeting of the leaders of seven 
coalition partners, also called for allowing business firms to 
donate to individual Diet members. 
  However, the SDP, the biggest party in the coalition, 
rejected the plan, expressing disaffection over the dropping of 
a blanket ban on individual acceptance of corporate donations 
from the compromise version, they said. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa told reporters he will make 
his own decision on whether to resign or not if the pacakge is 
scrapped. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said earlier in 
the day he can neither confirm nor deny whether the prime 
minister will resign if he fails to secure Diet approval for 
political reform. 
  Asked about an adviser's comment on the possible resignation 
of the cabinet depending on the result of Diet debate on reform, 
the top government spokesman said, "I neither confirm nor deny 
that." 
  Shusei Tanaka, a special adviser to Hosokawa, said Tuesday 
the premier may disband the cabinet and step down if he fails to 
get the measures put into law. 
  Hosokawa has pledged to take political responsibility if he 
fails to achieve political reform during the current Diet 
session, which ends Saturday. The package cleared the lower 
house last November. 
  Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said 
Hosokawa should dissolve the lower house for a snap general 
election, rather than stepping down, if the political reform 
program fails to win parliamentary approval by Saturday. "I 
don't think a mass resignation of the cabinet is possible with 
such a high level of public support," he said. 
  Hata also ruled out the possibility of carrying the 
government reform proposals over to the next regular session of 
the Diet, which begins next Monday. 
  With Saturday's closure of the current Diet session 
approaching, the prospects of reaching a compromise over the 
package at the Diet panel are poor because of major differences 
between the coalition and the LDP. 
  The legislation could also become law if passed a second 
time 
by the lower chamber by a majority of two-thirds or more of the 
members present. 
  However, the coalition will need about 70 LDP rebels to 
secure a majority of two-thirds in the lower house and political 
analysts predict such a case unlikely although the LDP is 
divided over the package. 
  Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of 
Employers Associations (Nikkeiren), a top business leader, 
called for early compromise on the political reform package so 
that the government can get down to the task of rebuilding 
Japan's economy.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 26 KYODO -- The ruling coalition 
parties agreed Wednesday to seek a consumer-oriented fiscal 1994 
budget designed to raise living standards while featuring 
measures to pull the economy out of recession, party officials 
said. The agreement, which came at a meeting of policy-makers 
from the seven parties in Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
coalition government, also calls for a third supplementary 
budget for fiscal 1994 to prop up the economy, they said. 
  But the parties stopped short of reaching a consensus on the 
issuance of deficit-financing government bonds to finance 
pump-priming measures. The budget-drafting platform did, 
however, agree upon the need to "pay attention to fiscal 
soundness." 
  The phrase is often used to underline the need to avoid 
raising government dependence on bonds for revenue, thereby 
issuing deficit-financing bonds. 
  Other key points in the platform are: 
  -- To review traditional ways to distribute government money 
and policy priorities. 
  -- To review ways to allocate funds to public works 
projects.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 22 KYODO -- Agricultural groups in 25 
of Japan's 47 prefectures have decided not to grow rice to be 
used for processing, a survey by KYODO NEWS SERVICE showed 
Saturday [22 January]. 
  The survey also showed that agricultural cooperatives in 15 
prefectures have refused to cooperate in the government's rice 
production adjustment program. 
  Farmers in these prefectures were strongly upset with the 
government's decision to partially open the rice market to 
imports. 
  The Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives (Zenchu) 
adopted a resolution last December not to cooperate with the 
government in producing rice for processing. 
  Zenchu officials said the union plans to urge the government 
to review its farming policy, featuring conversion of rice 
acreage for production of other farm produce. 
  Farmers are reluctant to produce rice to be used for 
processing because of low prices as compared with rice for table 
use. 
  Despite their strong reaction to the government's 
agricultural policy, many agricultural cooperatives acknowledged 
the need for production adjustment because of government 
subsidies.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 26 KYODO -- The House of Councillors on 
Wednesday voted down a censure motion against Farm Minister 
Eijiro Hata over the government's decision last December to open 
its rice market to imports. 
  The motion, submitted last December by the main opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), was rejected at an upper house 
plenary session by a vote of 130 against and 106 for. 
  Some members of ruling Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ] 
were expected to support the motion, but they voted against it 
or were absent from the vote, resulting in the rejection. 
  Several SDP members played a key role in voting down 
government- proposed political reform bills last Friday, 
refusing to obey the party leadership and joining the opposition 
in voting against the bills. 
  A censure motion was last cast in June 1992 against Prime 
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa in connection with the nation's 
cooperation in U.N. peacekeeping operations. That motion was 
also voted down. 
  The LDP cast censure motions against Agriculture, Forestry 
and Fisheries Minister Hata and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata 
last December after the government accepted a proposal to 
partially open Japan's markets to foreign-made rice. 
  The proposal was made as part of final negotiations in the 
Uruguay Round of global trade talks under the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  It calls for Japan to open 4 to 8 percent of its domestic 
rice market as "minimum access" for imports in exchange for a 
six-year moratorium for replacing all import restrictions with 
tariffs. 
  The upper house had delayed deliberation on the motions to 
concentrate on political reform bills. It did not take a vote 
on the motion against the foreign minister.

  [Text] President Ramos created yesterday a new body that 
will oversee the implementation of projects for the social and 
economic rehabilitation of rebels who have returned to the folds 
of the law. 
  The Chief Executive issued Executive Order (EO) No. 152 
creating the National Program for Unification and Development 
(NPUD) to replace the National Reconciliation and Development 
Program (NRDP) which had been rendered inoperative due to the 
deletion of its P200 million budget from the 1994 general 
appropriations act. 
  In the same EO, Mr. Ramos formed the three-man National 
Program for Unification and Development Council (NPUDC) to be 
headed by Interior and Local Government Secretary Rafael Alunan 
III. 
  The NPUDC will have Defense Secretary Renato de Villa and 
Presidential Adviser on Peace Process Oscar Santos as vice 
chairman and member. 
  The creation of the NPUDC is seen as a rebuff to the 
Senate's 
withdrawal of funding to the rebel-returnees program that was 
tantamount to the abolition of the NRDP. 
  The Senate chopped off the P200 million rebel-returnee 
program over the vehement objection of Malacanang which warned 
that such action would jeopardize the peace and reconciliation 
program. 
  The alleged rampant irregularities in disbursements of 
rebel- 
returnee fund induced the Upper Chamber into scrapping the said 
funding. 
  The senators gave credence to reports that funds were 
released for fake rebel-returnees and even ghost surrenderees. 
Malacanang, however, said that action was being taken to check 
the alleged anomalies. 
  The [Malacanang] palace said even assuming that these 
anomalies existed, this was not sufficient ground to withhold 
funding for the program.

  [Text] Members of the government panel negotiating peace 
talks with ultra-rightist groups appealed yesterday to the 
leaders of the Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa 
[Revolutionary Nationalist Alliance] (RAM) to return to the 
bargaining table for the resumption of the peace negotiations. 
  Professor Alfredo Tadiar, head of the government peace 
panel, 
said the resumption of talks with representatives of the RAM led 
by Brig. Gen. Edgardo Abenina cannot be suspended indefinitely 
because the country's stability is at stake. 
  "We call on RAM leaders to go back to the negotiating table. 
We hope that the substantive part of the talks would start 
soon," he said. 
  Tadiar explained that talks with RAM leaders were suspended 
last 2 December because of differences on procedures. 
  He said the technical working committee with representatives 
of both panels was about to discuss recommendations on 10 
talking points submitted by the RAM, such as electoral reforms 
and good government. 
  Former army lieutenant colonel Gregorio Honasan, also a RAM 
leader, reportedly complained about the government's failure to 
provide the right wing leaders with security, citing the 
numerous armed escorts of Nur Misuari, leader of Moro National 
Liberation Front (MNLF), during his stay in Mindanao in talks 
with government representatives. 
  Tadiar, however, ruled out any discrimination against the 
RAM, adding that it even failed to avail itself of the 30 
permits to carry firearms issued to it by the government for 
personal security. RAM leaders, he added, only got 12 permits to 
carry firearms. 
  The government panel also said that they remain optimistic 
that sincerity on both sides will still prevail despite the 
initial problems now affecting the talks.

  [Text] Defense Secretary Renato De Villa blamed Filipino 
communist exiles in the Netherlands for delaying peace talks and 
warned that the government is losing patience. Talks to end the 
25- year-old communist rebellion had ground to a halt because 
rebel leader Jose Maria [Joma] Sison insists on unacceptable 
terms for the talks, President Ramos told a visiting European 
Parliament delegation about the government's problems in talking 
to the fragmented communist movement. 
  Joma Sison issued a statement from his exile base in Utrecht 
last weekend calling on Ramos to drop his insistence that any 
accord should not violate the Philippine Constitution. He also 
asked for a second round of preliminary discussions to be held 
in the Netherlands before peace talks open in Vietnam. 
  President Ramos was informed yesterday by European 
parliamentarians that Utrecht-based communist leader Jose Maria 
Sison and his group no longer enjoy substantial support in 
Western Europe. The group told the president that Sison and his 
followers are now considered an isolated group, where before had 
received sympathy and support from some quarters. The visiting 
parliamentarians explained that the change in attitude towards 
Sison is on account of his continued adherence to the Maoist 
ideology, which now belongs to the past and has almost no future.

  [Text] The recently formed breakaway groups in the major 
leftist legal organizations are being funded by the government, 
according to exiled communist leader Jose Ma. Sison. The 
Netherlands-based Sison, in his renewed attacks against his 
critics, also accused columnist and University of the 
Philippines professor Alex Magno as being hired by the 
government to write anti-communist propaganda. 
  In a statement faxed to the INQUIRER yesterday, Sison said 
groups like the Bukluran ng Manggagawang Pilipino, Demokratikong 
Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas, and the Kapatirang Anak Pawis 
[Union of Filipino Workers, Democratic Peasants Movement of the 
Philippines, and the Brotherhood of Laborers] are being used by 
the government for propaganda against the Communist Party of the 
Philippines [CPP] and the National Democratic Front. 
  Magno laughed off the accusation, saying Sison should learn 
to be more tolerant of outside comments. "What does he want, no 
one comments on the CPP internal debate?" he asked, adding the 
debate has become a public issue.

<F P=106> [By Teddy Molina] </F>
  [Text] Bangued, Abra -- Police and provincial officials are 
impatient over the alleged slow turnover of firearms by troops 
of the Cordillera People's Liberation Army [CPLA] under former 
rebel priest Conrado Balweg. 
  Two deadlines set by the local Philippine National Police 
[PNP] lapsed last week but only 15 out of 45 firearms issued by 
the government to the CPLA men in this province had been 
returned, Supt. July Cordoviz, Abra PNP director, said. More 
than a hundred government firearms were loaned by the Aquino 
administration to the CPLA when the latter joined the 
government's anti-insurgency campaign in 1987. 
  Last month, President Ramos ordered Balweg and the CPLA to 
return all firearms issued to them. 
  Abra is the home base of Balweg but CPLA forces are also 
deployed in other Cordillera provinces. 
  Cordoviz, however, discounted the need to retrieve the rest 
of the guns by force, saying that he was relying on peaceful 
negotiations he had initiated with Balweg and the tribal groups' 
council of elders last 2 January. 
  On the other hand, Gov. Vicente Valera wanted all CPLA 
firearms "whether government-owned or CPLA-owned" taken in at 
once. 
  Valera said he will ask the national government for 
"specific 
moves" to hasten the turnover of the guns. 
  "We are ready in case (Interior Secretary Rafael) Alunan III 
tells us to do," Valera said. He did not elaborate. 
  At the start of Oplan Paglalansag [Operation Dismantle] last 
year, Valera called for the inclusion of the CPLA in the 
nationwide campaign against loose firearms, branding the group 
as a "private army." 
  He had complained against the group's alleged intimidation 
of 
voters during the last local elections and its alleged demand 
for food rations from villagers during its operation here. 
  Cordoviz said they had a dialogue with Balweg and his group 
in Luba, Abra where they agreed to comply with the president's 
directive. "But it's taking them a long time," he added. 
  Of the 15 firearms turned over by the CPLA here, three 
Garands and one M14 rifle were given during the 2-4 January Luba 
dialogue. 
  Eight Garands were brought to the PNP camp here on 6 and 9 
January, according to Cordoviz. 
  Other firearms now with the PNP were one M16 rifle and two 
Garands which were confiscated from CPLA men in Bucay town last 
3 November. 
  Cordoviz said he was scheduled to have a second dialogue 
with 
CPLA leaders led by Mariano Agostos from Luba this week.

<F P=106> [By Joem H. Macaspac] </F>
  [Text] President Ramos launched yesterday a program that 
would provide some two million jobs to the rural people in the 
next three years, with allocation of some P23 billion 
[Philippine pesos]. 
  Dubbed "Kabuhayan 2000," [Livelihood 2000] the project was 
simultaneously began in various parts of the country. The 
president presided over the launching ceremonies in Balayan, 
Batangas, together with Speaker Jose de Venecia and former Vice 
President Salvador Laurel. 
  The president designated Interior and Local Government 
Secretary Rafael Alunan III as chairman of the inter-agency 
committee that will implement the program. 
  In his speech at Balayan, the president said his government 
is pursuing the project as part of the national effort to 
improve the economy by providing better and high paying jobs to 
the rural folk. He said Kabuhayan 2000 is a vital cog in his 
Pilipinas [Philippines] 2000 economic development program for 
the Philippines. 
  Mr. Ramos stressed that the ultimate objective of the 
program 
is the eradication of poverty and consequently improving the 
quality of life of the people. 
  The employment plan, Mr. Ramos said, is also part of a 
three-pronged undertaken by the Presidential Council for 
Countryside Development, the Commission to Fight Poverty, and 
the Philippine Council for Sustainable Development. [sentence 
as published] 
  These agencies have been tasked with coming out with 
programs 
that would stimulate employment, accelerate production and 
generate capital. But the new employment program has the local 
government units at its forefront. The governors and mayors, 
through their respective organizations, have already accepted 
the president's challenge and agreed to work for the program's 
success. 
  The project will also have six components that each will be 
handled by one department. 
  Job opportunities will be created through reforestation, 
agribusiness development, rural enterprises, rural 
infrastructure, and job placement. 
  Thus, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources 
will be tasked with implementing the reforestation phase; the 
Department of Agriculture and Food on agribusiness development; 
the Department of Trade and Industry on rural enterprise 
development; the Department of Public Works and Highways on 
infrastructure projects; the Department of Labor and Employment 
on job placements; and, the Department of Interior and Local 
Government on capability building. 
  Mr. Ramos said funding for the project will come from 
various 
financial institutions, including those based in foreign 
countries. 
  He said P17.5 billion has already been obtained and the 
balance will be appropriated by next month. 
  The chief executive is confident that the program will 
succeed. The six main categories of the project are the 
so-called "multiplier enterprises" where one project or one job 
creates additional opportunities in the neighborhood for similar 
complimentary or supportive projects. 
  In Balayan, the president presided over the signing of an 
agreement among political opponents in the province. Among 
those who signed the covenant were former Vice President 
Salvador Laurel of the Nacionalista [Nationalist] Party; 
Batangas Gov. Vicente Mayo of the Nationalist People's 
Coalition; Rep. Hernani Perez, House minority leader, of the 
opposition Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino [Struggle of Filipino 
Democrats]; and Reps. Eduardo Ermita and Ralph Recto, both 
belonging to the House "Rainbow Coalition." 
  Mr. Ramos urged officials in the other provinces to emulate 
the lead taken by the Batangas officials who have decided to 
cross party lines and form a multiparty covenant seeking the 
success of the presidential employment program. 
  Mr. Ramos said politicians must now set aside their 
political 
interests so that they can effectively contribute to the general 
effort toward transforming the Philippines into a 
newly-industrialized country before the turn of the century. 
  Answering criticisms that his provincial sorties are mere 
junkets and do not contribute to the development of the rural 
areas, the president said his administration is now bringing the 
government to the people through innovative projects that 
directly benefit the citizenry.

  [Text] The country's trade gap ballooned to $5.17 billion 
during the first 10 months of 1993, wider by $1.13 billion from 
1992's comparative deficit of $3.85 billion. 
  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas [Central Bank of the 
Philippines] 
reported yesterday that the wider deficit was due to the faster 
growth of imports compared with exports. The country, however, 
was importing more capital goods and raw materials for 
re-export. For the month of October 1993, total merchandise 
exports reached $1,002 million, up 16.5 percent over the 
year-ago level of $860 million. 
  This brought aggregate exports from January to October 1993 
to rise by 12.8 percent to $9,121 million compared to the level 
for the same period last year. 
  The $1,034 million increase for the first 10 months can be 
traced primarily to the hike in shipments of manufactured goods, 
particularly electronics and electrical equipment and parts 
($608 million); garments ($132 million); and, machinery and 
transport equipment ($72 million). 
  Semi-conductor devices remained the country's leading export 
product with earnings amounting to $904 million. Other leading 
exports include finished electrical and electronic machinery and 
parts manufactured from materials imported on consignment; other 
electronic integrated circuits and micro assemblies; consigned 
women's wear; and, consigned children's and infants' wear. 
  During the review month, total imports amounted to $1,647 
million, 23.7 percent higher than the $1,331 million recorded a 
year earlier. 
  Imports for the 10-month period amounted to $14,291 million, 
up by 19.7 percent from the year-ago level of $11,939 million. 
  The upturn was attributed to the increase in arrivals of all 
major commodity groups except mineral fuels and lubricant. 
Imports of capital goods expanded by $1,108 million with power 
generating and specialized machines contributing the highest 
growth of $541 million, followed by telecommunication equipment 
and electrical machinery, aircraft, ships and boats, by $339 
million and $183 million, respectively. 
  Raw materials and intermediate goods imports rose by $952 
million on account of increased arrivals of materials and 
accessories for the manufacture of electronic equipment ($347 
million), metal products ($173 million), and iron and steel 
($137 million). Likewise, arrivals of consumer goods rose by 
$260 million attributed to higher demand for passenger cars and 
motorized cycle, and miscellaneous manufactures. 
  Petroleum crude maintained its position as the country's top 
leading import commodity notwithstanding the $183 million drop 
in its import value of $1,154 million. Other leading imports 
included dice on consignment basis [as published]; materials and 
accessories for the manufacture of other electrical machinery 
and equipment on consignment basis; parts of electronic 
integrated circuits and micro assemblies; and, fabrics for the 
manufacture of outer garments on consignment basis. 
  The country's merchandise trade balance in October 1993 
resulted in a deficit of $645 million, $174 million higher than 
the level a year ago. Based on the cumulative levels for the 
10-month period, the gap widened to $5,170 million or by $1,318 
million from the $3,852 million in the previous year.

  [Text] A retired Vietnamese general at the center of 
American suspicion over prisoners of war on Tuesday welcomed the 
U.S. report debunking two controversial Soviet documents on the 
issue. 
  General Tran Van Quang, alleged author of remarks reported 
in 
one of the documents, said the study by U.S. Intellegency Agency 
[as heard] released in Washington on Monday backed the Vietnam's 
stand that the documents were fabrications. He said the verdict 
by the U.S. agency would help speed up normal relations and 
benefit both Vietnam and America.

  [Text] As of today, 24 January 1994, the midterm national 
party conference had gone through five days of intensive and 
boisterous work with a high sense of reponsibility to the party 
and the people. 
  This conference is an important political event in the 
political life of our party and people. The conference is 
designed to review the actual situation to continue to step up 
the renovation process -- a process that is being undertaken in 
a changing and complex world situation. 
  The conference vociferously debated the Seventh Communist 
Party of Vietnam [CPV] Central Committee's political report 
presented by Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi at the conference. 
  Following the sixth party congress, the seventh party 
congress [as heard] has, over the past few years, substantiated 
and further perfected the renovation policy through its 
political platform and its socioeconomic development strategy 
which chart the course for the renovation to be carried out in a 
more extensive, harmonious, and steadier fashion along the 
socialist path. However, the renovation process, which is 
something new to us, is carried out at a time when the world 
situation is developing in a complex manner and when there are 
many new arising problems to be resolved promptly. 
  Over the past few days, during their debates -- either in 
group debates or collective debates -- and during their 
refreshment breaks, the delegates enthusiastically discussed and 
unanimously agreed with those essential matters cited in the 
political report, ranging from the review of the implementation 
of the seventh party congress resolution to the summming up of 
the actual situation of the renovation process, and the 
determination of major policies and measures aimed at firmly 
defending the country under all circumstances to successfully 
implement the seventh party congress resolution. 
  The delegates unanimously noted the three major achievements 
scored by our country, the most important being the fact that we 
have been able to overcome by a very important step the state of 
socioeconomic crisis, continue to maintain and consolidate 
political stability, broaden foreign relations, improve our 
country's prestige and position in the world, and thereby create 
a favorable international environment for our national 
construction and defense. 
  Against a background of a complicatedly changing world and a 
domestic situation plagued with difficulties, what has been 
achieved by us attests to the correctness of the party's policy 
and the appropriateness of its steps. Our national revolution 
has been and is being carried out in the right direction along 
the path of consolidating national independence and building 
socialism -- the path chosen by our Uncle Ho, our party, and our 
people. 
  These great achievements have generated new stature and 
strengths and new opportunities for us to gradually shift to a 
new stage of development where we can further accelerate our 
national industrialization and modernization. Besides these 
opportunities, the Vietnamese revolution is also facing new 
challenges, new deficiences, and new problems. Generally 
speaking, all the delegates unanimously agreed with various 
points summed up by the party Central Committee in its political 
report. These points are: 
  -- Although having achieved some economic development, our 
country remains one of the world's poorest countries. 
  -- Despite its faster pace of economic growth, there is the 
danger of being left further behind economically compared to 
nearby countries. 
  -- While we want peace and development, hostile forces are 
resorting to various schemes and tricks aimed at realizing their 
peaceful evolution strategy. We must always heighten our 
vigilance against this. 
  -- Our socioeconomic development, though guided along the 
renovation process, has given rise to many problems to be 
correctly dealt with if we are to keep our country from straying 
off the socialist path. 
  -- Corruption and other social ills, which have not been 
dispelled, are causing serious losses economically and a drop in 
the people's confidence. 
  All these are challenges to be overcome on the road toward 
development. Though not too optimistic, all the delegates firmly 
believed in the success of the renovation process. This is 
because we have, over the years, drawn on many useful lessons 
from objective realities. These lessons call for firmly 
maintaining the socialist course during the renovation process, 
linking the persistence in principles and revolutionary strategy 
with the flexibility in tactics, and remaining sensitive to 
acquire new things. While regarding as necessary the carrying 
out of the renovation in a comprehensive and uniform fashion, we 
must adopt appropritate steps, forms, and methods. We must also 
maintain the party leadership and state management in carrying 
out the commodity-based multisectoral economic development. We 
must develop socialist democracy, discover and correctly resolve 
those problems newly arising in renovation process. We must pay 
attention to reviewing realities, constantly supplement and 
gradually perfect our theory about the path toward buidling 
socialism. 
  The delegates unanimously agreed that although the 
renovation is an unprecedentedly difficult process, we have 
boldly found a way out, bravely marched forward, and scored very 
important successes. The most basic and most decisive factors 
are that our party has held a ruling role, that we do not accept 
pluralism and a multiparty system, that we have upheld a sense 
of independence, sovereignty, and creativity, that we have 
adopted a policy and line in conformity with the pattern of 
activity and the realities of Vietnam and that we have been able 
to develop the integrated strengths of the all-people great 
solidarity bloc and to broaden our international relations. 
  With a high sense of responsibility, all the delegates, 
whatever their field of activity, have expressed their sympathy 
for and contributed their views to unfailingly achieving the 
orientations and tasks for the period ahead as outlined in the 
political report, which calls for spurring a change in the 
econonomic mechanism along the direction of industrialization 
and modernization, consistently implementing the multisectoral 
economic development policy, and creating a driving force and 
more favorable environment for various economic components and 
various forms of enterprises to develop quickly and to achieve 
high results. We must harmoniously build the market system 
under the state management along socialist direction. 
  The delegates contributed numerous views on the tasks of 
caring for, fostering, and developing the human factor as a 
driving force and a goal of the revolution. The most prominent 
issues discussed consist of achieving social justice, improving 
intellectual standards, ameliorating the society, and preserving 
and developing the identity of folk culture. 
  Fighting corruption -- a present burning and pressing issue 
-- was also given attention by the delegates who unanimously 
agreed that the fight against corruption must be carried out in 
a resolute and drastic fashion in our entire working apparatus 
covering various echelons and sectors from the central down to 
local levels. 
  Not only was the national security and defense issue given 
attention by delegates from the armed forces but it also 
received the views of almost all the participants who called for 
maintaining political stability, fighting the enemy's peaceful 
evolution strategy, and preventing social negativism. 
  Most of the delegates also paid attention to the 
party-buiding and mass motivation tasks, especially the task 
regarding cadre organization. Some believed that we must have a 
consistent cadre organization policy that calls for not only 
gathering and propagating the younger generation of 
officially-trained party cadres and members but also for 
rallying the generation of party cadres and members with good 
records and experiences. They said that not much has been done 
in the spreading of propaganda on the party, especially among 
the younger generation, and that theoretical studies, especially 
the study of the theory on socialist construction, has not met 
requirements for attractiveness and for ideological guidance and 
actions among society. 
  Many delegates also analyzed the role of grass-roots party 
organizations at the village and ward levels, especially those 
in the rural areas and in mountain regions and those belong to 
state-, state-private, and privately-run economic 
establishments. They stressed the need to establish order and 
discipline within party organizations, improve daily party 
activities, both in terms of format and contents, to increase 
leadership skills, militancy, and the ability to fulfill the 
duties of the entire party and of each party echelon. 
  Delegates noted those results obtained in mass motivation in 
the past and pointed out the need to continue to strengthen 
leadership and guidance in a more practical fashion for the 
activities of various mass organizations, regarding this as an 
important factor to contribute to increasing the militancy and 
leadership skills of the party. As clearly outlined in the 
political report delivered by Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi, 
lying ahead of us is a new stage with promising prospects and 
great challanges that must be definitely overcome by us, and 
with opportunities that must be fully exploited. All of our 
party, Army, and people must be of the same heart and minds and 
must be united as one, trying to struggle to bring the 
renovation forward so as to score even-greater successes. 
  After four days of debates held in the form of both group 
debates and collective debates, the CPV Central Committee's 
political report delivered by Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi, 
today, 25 January 1994, delegates to the midterm national party 
conference held group debates, discussing and exchanging views 
in preparation for a by-election of members to the Seventh Party 
Central Committee. 
  Tomorrow, 25 January, the conference will be in plenary 
session at the conference hall.

<F P=106> ["Text" of closing speech by Do Muoi, party general </F>
secretary, at the MidTerm National Party Conference in Hanoi on 
25 January -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Dear party Central Committee advisers; Comrade 
Nguyen Huu Tho, president of the Vietnam Fatherland Front [VFF] 
Presidium; former members of previous Central Committee 
Political Bureaus; and conference delegates. 
  The Midterm National Party Conference [MNPC] accomplished 
its 
duty and achieved fine success after six days of urgent work 
with a high sense of responsibility to our revolutionary 
undertaking, the fatherland's destiny, and our national future. 
The delegates contributed their best to the success of the 
development of the democratic spirit in party activities. They 
expressed their agreement with the party Central Committee 
political report. They also took part in lively discussions and 
provided many important and correct opinions. 
  The delegates carefully selected qualified people to 
replenish the party Central Committee, which increased the 
strength of the leading party organ. This is the first time our 
party held a midterm national conference according to 
stipulations set forth in the party statutes. 
  Many new issues have arisen, including challenges, 
opportunities, difficulties, and advantages, in an international 
background and national situation of many changes. These issues 
have come up after only a little more than two years after the 
Seventh National Party Congress [SNPC]. They require the entire 
party's intelligence to evaluate the implementation of the SNPC 
resolution in the past, to review in one step our renovation 
cause since the Sixth National Party Congress, to analyze the 
current situation, to outline major policies and measures, and 
to replenish party cadres to the party leading organ. This will 
meet the current demands of our revolutionary stage and heighten 
the willpower and strengths of our entire party, Army, and 
people for the continuous advancement of our revolutionary cause 
and for the accomplishment of the goals, directions, and duties 
outlined by the SNPC. 
  The MNPC resolution concretizes and develops the spirit and 
content of the SNPC resolution in the new situation. We must 
quickly organize practical activities to disseminate and 
understand the resolution after this conference. Party 
committees at all levels must closely supervise the resolution's 
implementation together with the satisfactory organization of 
their midterm delegate meetings to accelerate control work, 
develop positive aspects, and quickly correct shortcomings and 
mistakes. 
  The government urgently must institutionalize the resolution 
content. Governments from the central to grass-roots levels 
must introduce detailed plans to quickly execute the resolution. 
Fatherland fronts and mass organizations must engage deeply to 
motivate the public, to strengthen the national unity block, to 
develop their existing emulative movements, and to organize new 
movements in order to widely gather and motivate everybody to 
enthusiastically transform the SNPC goals and major MNPC duties 
into realities. 
  We must strive to build clean and strong party and state 
mechanisms in order to satisfactorily implement the SNPC and 
MNPC resolutions and to ensure a correct direction for 
development. We must also improve leadership capacity and 
management efficiency. Our party is the party of the workers' 
class and a loyal representative of the interests of the 
workers' class, laborers, and entire nation. Since its 
formation, our party always holds the national flag high and 
fights determinedly for the fatherland's independence and the 
people's freedom and happiness. The past 60 years of history 
prove that our party is a vanguard fighting force for the entire 
nation. Our party is resolute about accomplishing this 
important duty in the new stage. All party cadres and members 
must earnestly study to improve their knowledge, quality, and 
morality; fight against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy; and 
continue their sacrifice and struggle for the revolutionary 
undertaking, thus deserving to be considered the people's loyal 
servant as Uncle Ho used to teach us. 
  We must study Marxist-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh Thought and 
correctly apply and develop them in the new situation. We must 
preserve, inherit, and develop our national characteristics and 
quintessence. We also must study and selectively acquire 
mankind's achievements and other countries' experiences to 
correctly and creatively apply them to Vietnam's real situation. 
We must not copy dogmas. All dogmas from this side or the 
other side will cause damage to the national revolutionary cause. 
  The MNPC calls on the entire party, Army, and people to 
develop our ancestors' fine tradition in national construction 
and protection. We must heighten the willpower of independence, 
sovereignty, and self-reliance; exercise diligence; practice 
frugality; instigate honesty; and uphold righteousness for the 
construction and protection of the fatherland and the party. We 
must work for the development of our economy, culture, and 
society; and we must strengthen our national defense and 
security to protect the regime that our people built with so 
much effort and the blood and bones of many generations. 
  The MNPC calls for the increase of unity and unanimity to 
fully exploit opportunities; eliminate dangers; overcome 
challenges; proceed with the national industrialization and 
modernization; take our renovation cause to new heights and 
depths for the goals of a rich population, strong nation, and 
just and civilized society; and gradually and successfully build 
socialism. 
  On the new year of 1994 and on entering the Year of the 
Monkey, I wish party Central Committee advisers; Comrade Nguyen 
Huu Tho, president of the VFF Presidium; former members of 
previous Central Committee Political Bureaus; conference 
delegates; and all comrades good health and more contributions 
to our party and people's revolutionary undertaking. 
  Our MNPC hails comrades who, for health reasons, voluntarily 
resigned from the party Central Committee to create favorable 
conditions for the appointment of younger comrades to the party 
leading organ. It is hoped that they will continue to actively 
contribute their experience to the party and state's common 
tasks. 
  On behalf of the MNPC Presidium, I declare the Midterm 
National Party Conference closed.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA Jan. 26 -- The successful Mid-Term 
National Conference of the Communist Party of Vietnam [CPV] has 
defined premises for taking the country to a new stage of 
development, says the national daily NHAN DAN in an editorial 
today. 
  After six days' sitting, the paper continues, the conference 
discussed and approved the political report of the party Central 
Committee delivered by General Secretary Do Muoi. The report 
assesses the realities of the renovation process of the country, 
identifies the opportunities and challenges it is facing, and 
maps out goals and major tasks for the coming years with a view 
to successfully implementing of the resolutions of the seventh 
party congress. 
  Delegates to the conference reviewed the achievements 
recorded by the party and the entire people over the past years, 
in substantially overcoming the socio-economic crisis, 
continuing to maintain and consolidate the country's political 
stability, broadening external relations. All of this made a 
valuable contribution to heightening Vietnam's position and 
prestige in the world, creating favourable conditions for 
national construction and defence. These initial but very 
important achievements, the paper notes, proves that the 
renovation process initiated and guided by the CPV is correct 
and the resolutions of the 6th and 7th party congresses are 
being realized. 
  The paper also hails the conference for its serious work 
with 
high responsibility when it openly pointed to the weaknesses, 
shortcomings and other newly arising problems that should be 
immediately settled. 
  The paper goes on: "To take those opportunities and 
challenges, our party must do its best to meet the requirements 
of its tasks, to renew and consolidate the close relationship 
between the party and the people. We must guarantee political 
and ideological unity among the entire party, educate all party 
officials and members so that they thoroughly understand the 
viewpoints and policies of the party, heighten their awareness 
and enhance their determination to persist in the socialist 
path, creatively apply and develop Marxism- Leninism, Ho Chi 
Minh Thoughts and the intellectual quintessence of our time...."

  [Text] The Khmer Rouge [KR] are reported to be planning a 
massacre of all fishermen of Vietnamese origin living in around 
the Tonle Sap lake area in Cambodia. Here is our radio's 
opinions: 
  The newspaper CAMBODIA LIFE on 19 January quoted sources as 
saying that Khmer Rouge General Chhit Choeun or Mok has ordered 
the Khmer Rouge's 998th Division to step up its operations 
around the Tonle Sap lake area to kill fishermen of Vietnamese 
origin. 
  The newspaper commented that the 998th Division comprises of 
young soldiers who are notorious for their barbarous acts. 
  This is not the first time the Khmer Rouge conducted 
terrorist acts against people of Vietnamese origin in Cambodia. 
The Khmer Rouge have never renounced their attempts to massacre 
these people, especially since 1993. On 10 March last year, the 
Khmer Rouge killed 46 people of Vietnamese origin in Chong 
Khneas village, Siem Reap provincial capital, near Tonle Sap 
lake. During the massacre, the Khmer Rouge resorted to barbarism 
in their killing of women, children, and old people. 
  Vietnamese residents living in Cambodia are under the threat 
every day and every hour. The Vietnamese Government and the 
world public have many times condemned the Khmer Rouge for such 
barbarous acts and called for appropriate measures to protect 
these people. However, until now, there have never been positive 
actions taken. 
  The newspaper CAMBODIA LIFE said the Khmer Rouge continue 
the 
policy of discrimination against Vietnamese nationals and the 
world community should take appropriate measures to check the 
barbarous hands of the Khmer Rouge.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA Jan. 23 -- Two more domestic airways, 
Hanoi-Dien Bien (Lai Chau Province) and Hanoi-Na San (Son La 
Province), will be reopened by mid-April this year. 
  More than 1 billion dong (roughly USD 100,000) have been 
spent in rebuilding the Dien Bien Airport, supplying it with air 
traffic control equipment, and building an air services system. 
  To upgrade the Na San Airport will take about 250 million 
dong (roughly USD 25,000). And to keep regular arrivals at the 
airport will need a further 1.2 billion dong (approximately USD 
120,000). 
  Operators will be Vietnam Airlines, Pacific Airlines and 
Vasco. 
  These two airports fell into disuse three to four years ago 
due to the lack of passengers and poor infrastructure. 
  Now growing demand for fast transport to serve tourism and 
business has prompted the Vietnam General Department of Civil 
Aviation to reopen these short flights between northern airports.

  [Text] On the afternoon of 22 January, Comrade Nong Duc 
Manh, member of the Political Bureau and chairman of the 
National Assembly, received at the National Assembly Building a 
delegation of cadres in charge of village and city grass-roots 
establishments in Bac Son District, Lang Son Province. 
  Chairman Nong Duc Manh was briefed by the comrade head 
delegate on the socioeconomic situations in all villages in the 
district. Next, two delegates -- one from the village that 
scores the best achievements and the other from the village that 
faces the most difficult problems -- briefed him on the living 
conditions, economic growth, and party-building work at the 
grass-roots establishments under their charge. 
  Chairman Nong Duc Manh was very happy to learn about those 
changes for the better. He warmly commended grass-roots party 
organizations and administrative organs in Bac Son District for 
having upheld the traditions of a revolutionary base and scored 
encouraging economic achievements. The planting of fruit trees 
and industrial crops has helped with the production of commodity 
goods. Small-scale hydroelectric power plants are working fairly 
well. All those achievements have contributed to improving the 
living conditions of ethnic minority compatriots to an important 
degree. 
  Chairman Nong Duc Manh expressed his hope that grass-roots 
party committee echelons and administrative organs in Bac Son 
District would continue to develop their revolutionary 
traditions and direct the people in satisfactorily carrying out 
the renovation cause and in materializing the goals of making 
the people rich and the country powerful and of bringinging 
about justice and civilization in society.

  [Text] BANGKOK, Jan 27 (AFP) -- Recent attempts by the 
Burmese junta to improve its image are purely "cosmetic," while 
the situation in the country remains highly "volatile," a 
Rangoon-based diplomat said here Thursday. Speaking with 
reporters, the diplomat, who requested anonymity, said members 
of the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) 
had "come to the conclusion that they need to change their 
image." 
  But he dismissed hints of political reform -- such as the 
proposition of a new constitution put forward by the National 
Convention, whose delegates are handpicked by the junta -- as 
pure "flummery." 
  "There is no disposition to yield power to anyone else in 
any 
way," he said, stressing that "the changes are only cosmetic." 
  The diplomat predicted Nobel Peace prize laureate Aung San 
Suu Kyi, whose National Democratic League (NLD) overwhelmingly 
won elections in 1990, would remain under house arrest though 
her sentence technically ends next July. She has been under 
house arrest since July 1989. Soldiers and wooden guard boxes 
at the entrance of her home were removed last Saturday. 
  The junta's current concern about image might result in "a 
public relations coup of some sort," such as allowing a single 
foreign diplomat to visit her. So far, only her husband, 
British academic Michael Aris and their two sons have been 
authorized to visit her. If she were released, he said, it 
could touch off spontaneous demonstrations. 
  "They're a volatile population," he said. "We know that from 
1988," the year pro-democracy demonstrations were crushed 
nationwide by the military. He also called current peace 
negotiations between the council and ten ethnic minority groups 
an example of "divide and conquer" and added: "There is still a 
policy of Burmanization." 
  Meanwhile, life for the Burmese has failed to improve, 
despite surface changes in the capital Rangoon and Burma's top 
tourist draw in the northern city of Mandalay, he said. SLORC 
had allowed select members of the military and their families to 
invest in businesses which had injected funds in those cities, 
he said. But "the rest of the country has been left untouched," 
he said. Food has become prohibitively expensive, while the 
salaries of civil servants and pensioners have been frozen since 
1989, he added. 
  People continue to be regularly rounded up for mock 
demonstrations of support for the SLORC, but "look like 
zombies," he said. 
  The diplomat's evaluations echoed a just published report 
from Amnesty International which said that small improvements 
have been made by SLORC in human rights during the second half 
of 1993, but that the use of torture and other form of 
ill-treatment against its opponents remained "endemic." 
  Still, the diplomat remained optimistic that foreign 
investment and increased exposure of the Burmese people to 
foreign media could pressure Rangoon for real reform. 
  Turning to China's influence in Burma, he said: "Chinese are 
everywhere in Rangoon, and Mandalay in particular." But "the 
driving power of the relationship is Kunming and Yunnan," he 
said, referring to the province on China's southern border with 
Burma and its capital, "not Beijing." 
  "There are rumours of resentment" with Chinese investors, he 
added. 
  Satellite dishes, while not widely available, are 
"ultimately 
beyond (SLORC's) control," he said, and promised to improve the 
flow of information. 
  He said he hoped that member countries of ASEAN -- the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, grouping Brunei, 
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Singapore -- 
would demand that certain conditions be met before granting 
membership to Burma, which some diplomats think is on the agenda. 
  In the short run, "the military is here to stay." Rumors of 
tensions between some top leaders may be true, but for now, 
"none can move against one another." 
  Furthermore, he said, "there is a sense that every order is 
followed from the top."

<F P=106> [By Yindee Loetcharoenchok in Rangoon] </F>
  [Text] The Burmese border minister has accused Thailand of 
being unwilling to co-operate to crush drug warlord Khun Sa and 
his Mong Tai Army, who can "dodge into Thailand whenever they 
want". 
  Lt Gen Maung Thint said Khun Sa and his followers survive 
only because they get food, arms and ammunition from sources in 
Thailand. He said Burmese government forces need Thai 
assistance if they are to crush them, but he has not yet raised 
the issue with Thai officials. 
  There was no immediate urgency. Rangoon was preoccupied 
negotiating truces with other armed ethnic groups and holding 
the national convention to draft a new constitution. 
  In the meantime, the ruling State Law and Order Restoration 
Council (Slorc) would accept Khun Sa's surrender if he also 
disarmed his Mong Tai Army. However Col Kyaw Win, deputy 
director of the Directorate of Defence Services Intelligence 
(DDSI), said that even if he surrenders Khun Sa will still have 
to answer for his crimes and his narcotics activities. 
  Khun Sa, or Chang Si-fu, controls a narrow strip of 
territory 
east of the Salween River in southern Shan State, alongside the 
Thai border province of Mae Hong Son. 
  "The Thai government is not willing to co-operate with us," 
Maung Thint told THE NATION. "They [Khun Sa's forces] get food, 
supplies, arms and ammunition from Thailand. That is why he 
still survives. His survival depends on Thailand. They 
[Thailand] never consider wiping out Khun Sa. Moreover, he is 
able to dodge into Thailand whenever he wants." 
  Maung Thint, minister for development of border areas and 
national races, said the MTA was unlike other ethnic forces, 
which are holding talks with Rangoon. Slorc considered Khun Sa 
both an insurgent and a drug baron. However the minister 
minimized the MTA's military strength, saying it has no fighting 
capability and relies on arms purchased with drug money. 
  "We are determined to fight him and wipe them [the MTA] out 
by force," he said. 
  However, "if he surrenders and disarms, the govemment will 
accept him and will let him participate in development 
projects". He said it would take time to "wipe Khun Sa out 
totally". "In the meantime, we are holding the national 
convention and are inviting other insurgent groups to return to 
the legal fold. In the present circumstances it is not the time 
to get rid of him." Kyaw Win was outspokenly critical of Thai 
authorities for allowing Khun Sa to "jump the fence" into 
Thailand. He said the Burmese military had no immediate plan to 
move against the MTA and was currently pursuing a "containment 
policy", trying to restrict its movement and territory. 
  The colonel said up to 50,000 troops and porters would be 
needed to bring down Khun Sa and that high government casualties 
would be unavoidable. The MTA could field an estimated 
8,000-15,000 fighters. The rugged terrain posed no 
difficulties, he claimed, although air strikes were not likely 
due to the danger of accidental encroachment into Tnailand and a 
shortage of helicopters. He also pointed to the likelihood a 
new drug kingpin emerging once Khun Sa was eliminated.

  [Text] RANGOON, Jan 27 (AFP) -- Burma's timber trade, 
halted during a three-month government probe into malpractice 
allegations against both entrepreneurs and corrupt officials, 
has been allowed to resume, officials say. Local timber 
merchants contacted by AFP said they still needed clearance, 
however, from the military commanders with jurisdiction over the 
areas where timber concessions are located. 
  Dozens of people were given stiff jail sentences in 
connection with shady deals uncovered during the investigation 
by military intelligence, highlighted in the state-owned press. 
But local observers noted that prices for timber and wood-based 
fuel had risen in the wake of the clampdown. Charcoal, used 
widely for cooking, now costs more than 500 kyats per basket, or 
around 12 kyats per pound -- almost three times the cost to 
consumers previously, the observers said. 
  A would-be house-owner cited a similar rise: "I'm suddenly 
having to pay for my building material almost triple the prices 
of just three months ago." 
  Under a new forest law promulgated in 1992, which strictly 
limits extraction of timber for commercial purposes, Burma -- 
which owns nearly 75 percent of the world's teak reserves -- 
said it intended to preserve its forest resources. The law 
required private timber merchants to apply for official permits 
through a competitive bidding system which was intended to 
encourage private sector investment in the industry while 
curbing illegal logging. But reports of widespread malpractice 
involving timber businessmen, abetted by corrupt officials, 
triggered a sudden halt to logging in November and the official 
investigation. 
  Thousands of tons of illicit logs were seized and an 
unspecified number of smugglers and corrupt government officials 
were identified. A recent report in the official NEW LIGHT OF 
MYANMAR cited the example of 11 timber merchants and as many 
forest department employees who were sentenced this month by a 
special court in Rangoon to seven years in jail for illegal 
logging, smuggling and bribery. The daily said the government 
had recovered cash and assets which were declared state property. 
  The money collected paid largely for a state-of-the-art 
multi-million-dollar international business center on the shores 
of Rangoon's Inya Lake. At its recent inauguration, a senior 
forestry official said the center had cost the state "next to 
nothing." 
  "We constructed the building practically cost-free because 
all the expenses were paid for with fines and penalties slapped 
on timber merchants, both foreign and local, caught cheating 
us," he said, adding that the illegal logs confiscated had also 
gone a long way to defraying the costs. The official disclosed 
that one foreign logging company caught red-handed not only had 
to pay a hefty fine but was charged double for logs already 
extracted, even though the wood was of the "unreserved species." 
  Reliable sources said meanwhile that some logging 
concessions 
had been given a three-month extension for extraction if 
companies paid stiff fines and double charges to take out the 
logs.

  [Text] The government will take action against opposition 
politicians found doing something against the interests of the 
nation. Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said this 
today. However, the government would be very careful before 
taking such action as the government did not want to be seen as 
persecuting opposition politicians. The prime minister was 
commenting on an Australian news report that the Australian 
Secret Intelligence Service, ASIS, paid bribes to Malaysian 
opposition politicians in an alleged unauthorized [word 
indistinct] meddling in the internal political affairs of a 
foreign nation. The report which quoted former ASIS field 
agents said the opposition politicians had over many years been 
receiving tens of thousands of dollars in bribes from the 
Australian spy agency. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said the 
government would carry out its own investigation into the matter 
as well as keep a close watch on developments in Australia.

  [Excerpt] Kuala Lumpur, Jan. 27 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia 
has categogically denied that there is any link between a 
hydroelectric project and the building of a special forces 
complex under the Malaysia-United Kingdom memorandum of 
understanding (MOU) on the purchase of defence equipment. 
  Defence Minister Najib Tun Razak Said: I deny categorically 
the connection between the Pergau Dam (in the northeastern 
Kelantan State) and the MOU which is a programme for the 
modernisation of the Malaysian Armed Forces. 
  The establishment of the special forces complex in Mersing 
Town in the southern Johor State was one of the armed forces' 
development projects, the masterplan of which had been 
completed, he told reporters at a press conference here 
Wednesday. 
  Najib said the construction of the multimillion camp 
complex, 
basically for special forces troops, would be implemented under 
the Seventh Malaysia Plan (1996-2000) as the financial ceiling 
for the project had been exceeded. 
  He said British special forces personnel might be involved 
in 
the construction phase of the complex. 
  The master plan for the Mersing project was drawn up by 
British construction company John Laing International. 
  Najib said some foreign military personnel might be trained 
at the Mersing special forces camp but there would be no 
permanent basing of large foreign troops there. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Fri. -- Malaysia and Spain have 
agreed to set up a joint commission to enhance bilateral 
cooperation between the two countries, Foreign Minister Datuk 
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said. 
  Speaking to reporters after meeting with his Spanish 
counterpart Javier Solana at Shangri-La hotel here tonight, 
Abdullah said Spain wanted to have an increased presence in 
ASEAN due to the region's rapid economic growth and peaceful 
situation. He said the commission would carry out activities 
towards improving bilateral ties with the signing of several 
agreements on economic and technological cooperation later this 
year. 
  Abdullah said during the one-and-a-half-hour meeting, 
several 
agreements on investment agreement guarantee, culture, partial 
abolition of visa and air service were discussed. 
  Solana who was accompanied by four senior officials, arrived 
here today for a one-day visit on the invitation of the 
Malaysian Government. 
  Abdullah said Solana was also receptive to his idea that 
Spain organise a Spain Week here to showcase its products and to 
provide information to further boost two-way ties. 
  "Spain plans to organise the event sometime this year in 
conjunction with Visit Malaysia Year '94. This is good because 
there would be many tourists here." 
  Abdullah said he would also like to see other countries 
wishing to establish bilateral ties with Malaysia to organise 
similar events.

  [Text] We start with a report from Malaysia where, as you 
know, President Sali Berisha is on a visit. Let us hear a 
telephone report by the spokesman of the President's Press and 
Information Office, Aida Shehu: 
  [Shehu] Yesterday evening, President Berisha held a meeting 
in the Malaysian Chamber of Commerce. Besides members of the 
Malaysian National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 
representatives of firms that are members of the Chambers of 
Commerce and Industry, foreign investors operating in Malaysia, 
representatives of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Chinese and 
Indian businessmen, etc., were present. 
  President of this chamber Mr. Vanazmi gave the opening 
speech. In his welcoming speech, he expressed pleasure at 
President Berisha's visit to the Malaysian Chamber of Commerce 
and stressed the possibilities of expanding economic relations 
between our two countries, the interest of Malaysian and foreign 
firms in the Albanian market, investments in Albania, and so on. 
  In his speech, President Berisha stressed that his visit to 
Malaysia serves not only to expand relations at the political 
level, but economically as well. He also expressed his 
satisfaction over the great number of businessmen participating 
in this meeting and their interest in Albania. Later, President 
Berisha pointed out the arguments that favor foreign investors 
operating in Albania, and precisely the economic reform that 
destroyed the collective sector not only in the economy, but 
also in the collectivist mentality of the people in our country. 
He also mentioned the political stability created by the 
support of the majority of the population for the Meksi 
government and the new Albanian legislation, which offers 
absolutely attractive possibilities for foreign investors, such 
as the possibility of transferring capital and dividends, 
renting land, a free hand with labor, and a young population 
capable of work. 
  In the meeting with the president, the managers of the best 
known Malaysian firms and foreign firms operating in Malaysia 
expressed their intention to come to Albania and get acquainted 
with the specific cooperation possibilities, especially now 
after the creation of the complete legal framework for economic 
cooperation between the two countries with the signing of five 
agreements that guarantee security. President Berisha also 
inaugurated the Center for Malaysian Promotion in Albania. 
  This morning, President Berisha held separate meetings with 
Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed and His Majesty 
Sultan Azlan Shah, who guaranteed President Berisha the 
agreements and their application. They also told Berisha that 
the Malaysian Government will encourage investors and 
investments in Albania and promised to help in the construction 
of housing for the population, the education of students, 
cooperation between the Albanian and Malaysian 
telecommunications, and so on. 
  This morning, too, President Berisha left Kuala Lumpur after 
ending his successful visit and departed for a one-day visit to 
the island of Langkawi. The country authorities organized a 
meeting at which the general region development manager gave a 
briefing on the island's development prospects. 
  Later, the president paid a visit to a crocodile farm. 
  Tomorrow, Berisha will again hold talks in Langkawi and at 
midday he will leave for Brunei.

  [Text] Indonesia has urged Malaysia to respond to its 
statement on the status of Sipadan and Ligitan in order to 
accelerate the settlement of the dispute over ownership of these 
islands. This came up during additional talks between the 
Indonesian and Malaysian delegations in Kuala Lumpur yesterday. 
Indonesia had hoped that the two countries would agree on some 
principles to serve as a basis for the next round of talks. 
According to Indonesian chief delegate Izhar Ibrahim, the 
Indonesian Government reiterated its position on the ownership 
of Sipadan and Ligitan in 1992 through a memorandum and 
supporting documents, such as a territorial map. Malaysia has 
yet to respond, however. Meanwhile, Malaysian chief delegate 
Ahmad Kamil Jaafar said the two countries would be able to 
settle the matter amicably.

<F P=106> [By Han Fook Kwang in New Delhi] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi -- In a major move to boost Singapore's 
external economy, the Government is setting up a $150 million 
venture capital fund which will assist companies going abroad. 
Announcing this to Singapore reporters covering the Prime 
Minister's visit here Trade and Industry Minister Yeo Cheow Tong 
said yesterday that the fund will also have a unique component 
-- it will also target budding entrepreneurs. 
  Mr Yeo said the fund will in essence, operate like any other 
venture capital fund, but with a regional focus. 
  A private sector fund manager will be appointed to manage 
it. 
Investments will be made in private companies which are 
"regional" or "going regional" and whose projects will benefit 
the Singapore economy. 
  In return, equity participation will be obtained in the 
companies. 
  The fund was recommended originally by the Committee to 
Promote Enterprise Overseas chaired by Minister of State 
(Finance) Teo Chee Hean. The unique part of the scheme lies in 
its additional goal -- to bring together budding entrepreneurs 
with the projects that have been identified by the fund manager. 
  Low cost funds will be made available to the entrepreneurs 
to 
help them obtain a stake in these companies-- up to S4 for every 
dollar from the entrepreneur. Mr Yeo told reporters that this 
was to encourage budding entrepreneurs to venture into the 
region. 
  "We'll work through the private sector to identify projects 
and potential entrepreneurs who wish to go abroad but lack the 
financial means to do so, although they have the expertise," he 
said. 
  If they succeed, the intention of the scheme is to help them 
gain a significant stake in the companies after three to seven 
years. 
  Existing entrepreneurs already in business but who lack the 
means to expand abroad are also eligible for such assistance. 
  This component of the fund is targeted at those who have the 
characteristics of entrepreneurship: a practical vision or a 
good track record but lack the means to carry out their ideas or 
expand their businesses overseas. 
  They can be from the private or the public sectors. 
  The Economic Development Board Investment Pte Ltd [Private 
Limited] (EDBI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of EDB [Economic 
Development Board], will oversee the fund through the private 
fund manager. 
  The fund is expected to exceed $150 million [Singapore 
currency], with the Government contributing more than $100 
million. Private sector funds will also be sought. Mr Yeo 
pointed out that the Government was not giving away "free money" 
to any entrepreneur. 
  "We're participating with him. He must first be prepared to 
put his own money on the line," he said. 
  Replying to a question on why the scheme was necessary when 
there were private venture capital companies around already, Mr 
Yeo said that a different set of criteria would apply for the 
Government- inspired scheme. 
  Private fund managers, he added, might only want to support 
those with a proven track record. 
  Thus, those who were working in companies but had never set 
up their own might not qualify. Yet they might be precisely 
those whom the Government was trying to encourage as they had 
the expertise. 
  An MTI [Ministry of Trade and Industry] official said it had 
consulted the private sector on the scheme and the feedback had 
been positive. 
  "Our business leaders agree that there are many people out 
there who have the bright ideas and the ability and drive to 
carry them through, but for the lack of financing and 
opportunity," he said. 
  While some will make it in any case, this "matchmaking" 
scheme broadens the net. If, by providing the extra push and 
financial backing we can increase the pool of entrepreneurs, it 
will be good for Singapore, he said.

  [Text] The influx of Vietnamese refugees back to Cambodia 
by boat has drawn a strong reaction from the Army of Democratic 
Kampuchea. Taking advantage of the permission given by the 
royal government allowing all fishing groups to carry on their 
activities, Vietnamese settlers -- who have been fishing in 
Cambodia since 1979 and fled to live along the 
Cambodian-Vietnamese border for fear of massacre by the Khmer 
Rouge -- have returned with their fishing boats. This is not 
legal at all. 
  According to sources in the Khmer Royal Armed Forces in the 
4th Military Region, the Khmer Rouge [KR] has strongly reacted 
to the return of illegal Vietnamese settlers. The sources also 
said that the Khmer Rouge have accused the government of 
colluding with Vietnam and allowing many Vietnamese fishing 
boats into the country without any strict restrictions against 
these Vietnamese. 
  According to other reliable sources, however, Khmer Rouge 
leader General Chhit Choeun alias Mok -- who has gone to the 
border intersection of Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand for medical 
treatment -- has ordered Division 980 under the command of 
"Muon" to resume its operations, particularly the Tonle Sap unit 
which is believed to be the Khmer Rouge's special military unit. 
This Khmer Rouge official based his remarks on the return of 
Vietnamese fishermen. This source also specified that the Tonle 
Sap unit, most of whose members are young, courageous, and 
violent, are preparing for action in and along the Tonle Sap. 
  This source went on to say that except for the Tonle Sap 
unit, the Khmer Rouge command has dispatched small groups to the 
Anlung Veng or Pailin areas to assist in the defense of these 
two regions against the royal government troops. 
  It should be recalled that last year nearly 40 Vietnamese 
lost their lives in the Khmer Rouge attack on the village of 
Chong Khneas in Siem Reap. This was a racist act on Vietnamese 
fishermen in boats. It forced these fishermen to hastily leave 
their shelters. Now such racist acts are continuing. This is 
why the Tonle Sap unit is preparing to launch operations in the 
Tonle Sap to coincide with the arrival of Vietnamese fishing 
groups in the areas where they used to do business.

village in the Russei Krang commune have captured two Vietnamese 
communist agents. The agents were planted in the village to 
carry out the Communist Party of Vietnam's policies in Cambodia 
and lead the networks of the puppet Cambodian People's Party 
[CPP] and puppet administration in the districts, communes, and 
villages. The report says that the people captured these two 
Vietnamese communists after discovering their identity. They 
found out that these two have often met with and made reports to 
the Vietnamese in Moung District. They are both Vietnamese 
nationals who speak Cambodian. They are in charge of the CPP 
and the Vietnamese communist puppets and their administration in 
Moung District and the Ta P'de-Kaos Kralar area. [passage

of 24 January. 
  Samraong District, which is the seat of Oddar Meanchey 
Province, which is the hotbed of corruption of the Vietnamese 
communist puppet ringleaders and Nhoek Bunchhai's group, was 
attacked and destroyed by 2,000 people. Samraong, the 
provincial seat of Oddar Meanchey, which is the frontline 
command post of the Vietnamese communist puppet army and field 
headquarters of Ke Kumyan, Pol Saroeun, Prum Samen, Long 
Sopheap, Eng Sopheap, Nhoek Bunchhai and a number of other 
generals with second-hand stars on their shoulders, was attacked 
and smashed by 2,000 people in and around Samraong on the night 
of 24 January. As a result of this people's attack, General 
Long Sopheap, commander of the 4th Military Region in Siem Reap; 
Gen. Prum Samen, representative of Vietnamese communist puppets' 
General Staff; Gen. Nhoek Bunchhai, who got his stars as a favor 
from the Americans; Eng Sopheap, Army commander and governor of 
Oddar Meanchey Province; and all other Vietnamese communist 
puppet ringleaders fled in disarray. Many were wounded. 
  This is a punishment that the general public meted out to 
the 
evil puppet ringleaders serving the Vietnamese communists and 
the alliance. This is a great event, clearly proving that the 
people will not allow the evil Vietnamese communist puppet 
ringleaders to continue serving the Vietnamese communists in 
waging war to kill our nation and people.

  [Excerpt] At 0800 on 25 January, the Vietnamese communist 
puppet ringleaders -- including (Kieng Savantha) of the 
Vietnamese communist puppet General Staff; a number of generals 
serving as deputy commanders in the 4th Military Zone; the 
provincial chief and deputy chiefs; district chiefs; and many 
military officers at the rank of colonel, major, and captain -- 
organized a meeting at a Siem Reap hotel. They were to announce 
their support for the three-point conditions of the puppets Hun 
Sen and Chea Sim and the Cambodian People's Party, and their 
rejection of the king father's five-point policy. They forced 
over 1,000 people from the market places and officials from 
various offices to attend the meeting. 
  After they had been speaking for about two minutes, three or 
four bombs exploded in the middle of the mass meeting, killing 
three officers at the rank of colonel and brigadier general, 
three provincial officials, two district officials, and six 
policemen. The others fled in great alarm. The lower part of 
(Kieng Savantha's) trousers was hit and torn by a bomb fragment. 
He fled in great alarm. The other military personnel and 
policemen also fled from the crowd. 
  The people there were frightened, but they felt very happy 
about this development. It showed that a number of people and 
parasoldiers [puok para] [troops of the Khmer People's National 
Liberation Front] arranged this attack against the Vietnamese 
communist puppets who have bullied, starved, and forced the 
people to fight and die for them. [passage omitted]

or not," Minister/State Secretary Murdiono said following the 
meeting between the two heads of state at Merdeka Palace here. 
  Both leaders also agreed to open diplomatic relations but no 
decision was made on whether embassies will be established in 
Jakarta and Sarajevo. 
  Arriving here on Tuesday, Izetbegovic will leave for India 
Wednesday to explain the latest situation in the embattled 
Bosnia. 
  Suharto, as chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), has 
asked the Indonesian ambassador to the United Nations in New 
York to contact the NAM Coordinating Bureau there about the 
possibility of holding the conference, said Murdiono. 
  Izetbegovic called for an international conference to 
replace 
the Geneva talks which has so far failed to settle the crisis in 
Bosnia. 
  According to Murdiono, Suharto welcomed Izetbegovic's effort 
to try to lift the UN arms embargo on Bosnia who is less 
equipped than the more militarily powerful Serbia and Croatia. 
  "The president as NAM chairman will urge the world to treat 
Bosnia fairly in its fight against much stronger enemies," said 
Murdiono, adding that Suharto had expressed his support for the 
lifting of the embargo. 
  Over 200,000 Bosnian Muslims have been killed and millions 
more expelled since Serb and Croatian aggressors occupied 
Bosnia. About 70 percent of Bosnia is now in the hands of its 
enemies. 
  Izetbegovic said the ending of the embargo was necessary to 
balance the military strengths of all warring parties. A 
military balance is expected to help lead to peace. He also 
suggested an air strike on Serbia in a bid to pressure them into 
considering peace. 
  "A combination of force and negotiations is necessary to 
stop 
the war," he said, adding that all forms of talks so far had 
focussed on Bosnia relinquishing parts of its territory. "But 
we cannot accept unjust division of our country," the Bosnian 
president argued. 
  The UN Security Council mainly dominated by the United 
States, France, Britain, Russia, and China has issued 30 
resolutions on the Bosnian war. However, none of them have been 
implemented accept the arms embargo. 
  Commenting on the planned withdrawal of UN forces from 
Bosnia, Izetbegovic said it would create more difficulty in 
keeping peace. 
  "If Europe wants to pull out some of its troops, then the 
United Nations should allow other non-European countries to 
replace them," he added. 
  European officials recently reviewed the UN presence in 
Bosnia and UN sources in Sarajevo confirmed that plans to 
withdraw the peacekeepers and aid workers are underway. 
  Turkey and Iran have offered to send troops to help Bosnia 
Muslims but the United Nations refused the proposal without 
providing an explanation. 
  Before leaving Jakarta, the Bosnian delegation received 
U.S.$70,000 worth of humanitarian aid from the Indonesian 
Solidarity Committee for Bosnian Muslims. Also included in the 
package were 450 grams of gold and watches, and a cheque worth 
U.S. $24,600 from the Irsyad al-Islamiyyah religious association. 
  Chairman of the Solidarity Committee Geys M. Amar explained 
that the gifts were spontaneous donations collected at mosques 
from Muslims all over the country.

  [Text] The dailies ANGKATAN BERSENJATA and PELITA 
highlight the visit of Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic to 
Indonesia in their respective editorials. The Bosnian president 
is asking members of the Nonaligned Movement [NAM], which is 
chaired by President Suharto, to send a peacekeeping force to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to end the civil war in the Balkan nation. 
The Bosnian war is dragging on. Some 250,000 people have been 
killed, thousands more injured, and (?2 million) made refugees 
by the war. 
  Peace efforts undertaken by the United Nations, the European 
Community, and NATO have failed. The worrisome situation is 
partly due to the continued UN arms embargo on the nation. 
Serbian and Croatian forces continue their attacks in violation 
of the UN resolutions on the cease-fire. 
  The two dailies describe as normal and noteworthy the 
request 
of President Alija Izetbegovic for a peacekeeping force from 
Indonesia and the NAM in order to achieve peace in the former 
Yugoslav republic because former Yugoslavia is a NAM founding 
member. This will also strengthen efforts of Islamic Conference 
Organization members and the United States to have the arms 
embargo lifted and peace efforts by the United Nations, the 
European Community, and NATO.

  [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- The Indonesian Democratic Party 
(PDI) has charged that the `single majority' Indonesian 
political system can lead towards either a dictatorship or a 
tyranny of the majority. 
  The country's smallest party, in a political statement read 
by its chairperson Megawati Sukarnoputri at the commemoration of 
its 21st anniversary here last night, said a `single majority' 
is not in line with the 1945 Constitution or the Guidelines of 
State Policy decreed by the People's Consultative Assembly last 
year. 
  "The Constitution says the state protects `all Indonesians' 
based on the national unity for their good and welfare," the 
statement said, adding that the state must rise above the 
interests of individuals or groups in pursuing this goal. 
  "The system of deliberation leading to a consensus is the 
core of Pancasila democracy, while the `single majority' clearly 
deviates from this spirit," it said. 
  "`Single majority' is also in opposition to the spirit of 
openess, cooperation, and ethics in politics," the statement 
said. It added that the system tends to discourage people from 
observing the Guidelines of State Policy. 
  "Democracy means that sovereignty comes from the people, for 
the people and is supervised by the people," it said while 
throwing doubts on the congruity between the system of single 
majority and democracy. 
  The PDI also urged government to avoid the unnecessary cost 
of development paid by the people in the second 25-year 
development program.

  [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan spoke with 
newsmen after returning from an official visit to Malaysia. He 
said there were discussions about turning ASEAN into a center 
for cooperation with organizations in other regions. A meeting 
on this will be held in Bangkok from 3 to 4 February. According 
to Surin, Malaysia concurred that ASEAN should take the lead in 
developing capital for the gas and oil sector and spread this 
capital to other regions, particularly to Indian ocean countries. 
  Surin said there has been considerable progress in 
Thai-Malaysian relations, including in the economic triangle 
project. Regarding the private sector's proposal to open the 
Thai-Malaysian border around the clock, Surin said Malaysia is 
interested in the proposal and is considering it. The question 
is whether the Thai side, particularly the Thai Government 
sector, is ready and whether there are enough goods to pass the 
border to justify a 24-hour opening. 
  Surin said APEC was also discussed with Malaysian officials. 
An APEC meeting will be held in Jakarta in May.

  [Text] In a move related to the crackdown on pirated audio 
and video tapes and compact discs, private and public sector 
organisations are to compile a report on production costs for 
use in checking on possible over-pricing. Three private 
organisations and two departments of the Commerce Ministry are 
to make the calculations, so that the ministry can ensure that 
legitimate tapes and discs are not overpriced. The application 
of anti-monopoly and price-fixing powers to tapes and discs was 
introduced after the current crackdown on piracy was launched 
last April. 
  The government has described their use as a means of 
preventing the exploitation of copyright protection as well as 
giving officials a greater ability to track down whether 
products currently sold are legitimate or not. By making tapes 
and discs controlled products, officials have more power to 
monitor production and trade. 
  Speaking after a meeting on Monday on intellectual property 
violations, Deputy Commerce Minister Churin Laksanawisit said 
the crackdown has been effective, with only a small amount of 
piracy remaining. 
  He said the International Federation of Phonographic 
Industries (IFPI), the Record Association of Thailand, the 
Traders' Association of tapes and video tapes, the Internal 
Trade Department and the Commercial Registration Department were 
asked to jointly assess the production costs of music tapes, 
compact discs and video tapes. 
  The outcome of the evaluation which would be reported to the 
meeting body at the next session, would serve as a basis for 
determining the fairest and most suitable prices of these 
products for local sale, he said. 
  "After the Government has applied serious suppressive 
measures against rights violations, it was reported that the 
prices of music tapes, compact discs and video tapes in Bangkok 
have not moved up much, according to a recent price survey 
conducted by the Internal Trade Department in both Bangkok and 
other provinces," the deputy minister said. 
  "At some places which were notorious sources for the 
convenient purchase of pirated products, such as along Khao San 
Road in Banglamphu, the rate of violations has been reported to 
have dropped dramatically by half. The Record Association of 
Thailand claimed the rate has fallen by as much as 70 percent in 
these places," he said. 
  "Despite the discrepancy, these figures reveal the same 
satisfactory trend -- a declining rate of violations." 
  In view of the prices of these products in the other 47 
provinces nationwide, it was found that the prices of music 
tapes had not changed much. However, video tapes sold in Chiang 
Mai and Phitsanulok have moved up to 350 baht from 270 baht 
apiece while rental rates of the products have risen by 12-15 
baht each. 
  In Lamphun the prices of music tapes have increased from 80 
to 85 baht each, while in Songkhla tape prices have risen from 
60-80 baht to 85 baht apiece. 
  These prices, however, cannot serve as a median for the 
fairest of prices. Therefore, the three private associations 
are requested to report the actual production costs for further 
consideration by the Commerce Ministry. 
  "Should it turn out that the margins are unreasonably high, 
regulatory measures will be imposed. Such requirements may 
include clear marking of prices, special authorisation in the 
case of price-raising, or controlling retail prices altogether," 
Mr Churin added. 
  During the first half of this month the Intellectual 
Property 
Department, in cooperation with the Police Department, has 
investigated 62 cases of piracy and sent them for trial with 
14,233 pieces of products confiscated. 
  As for the suppressive measures targeted at mail order sales 
of the products, the Communications Authority of Thailand has 
cooperated very well. A special decoy unit to detect shops 
selling pirated products has also been in operation.

  [Text] On 25 January, a day before the debate at the U.S. 
Senate on the lifting of the trade embargo against Vietnam, 
former U.S. war veterans, who are now Senate members, called for 
the support of a resolution demanding the lifting of the trade 
embargo to help solve the fate of more than 2,000 American 
missing in Southeast Asia. 
  Democratic Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, Republic Senator 
McCain of Arizona, and Democratic Senator Pressler of South 
Dakota stressed that the Vietnamese Government is cooperating to 
the best of its ability with the United States in locating 
American remains in rural areas, examining archives, and 
creating favorable conditions for the U.S. side to interview 
Vietnamese war veterans on what happened to American soldiers 
missing in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. They said the United 
States is in danger of losing this great cooperation unless it 
lifts the trade embargo against Vietnam. 
  Senator Kerry said we have reached an agreement with 
Vietnam. 
If they help us with their documents, contacts, and 
excavations, then we must reciprocate. In another interview on 
25 January, he also stressed that it is about time to totally 
lift the trade embargo. 
  Meanwhile, according to THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, U.S. 
Government officials on 26 January said that based on the 
progress reached, high-level advisers of President Clinton have 
suggested that the trade embargo be lifted.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] U.S. Senator John Kerry says it is time for the 
United States to lift its trade embargo against Vietnam. This 
is our radio editor's editorial: 
  Senator John Kerry has many times visited Vietnam and 
excavation sites to settle problems relating to POW-MIA or the 
missing-in-action issue. He has met with leaders of the 
Vietnamese party and Government as well as ordinary Vietnamese 
citizens. More than anyone else, he understands and correctly 
assesses the Vietnamese people and country. After his recent 
visit to Vietnam, he declared in Washington on 25 January that 
it is time we lifted the trade embargo because it is no longer 
against Vietnam -- thus against us [sentence as heard]. 
  The selection committee on POW/MIA issue of the U.S. Senate 
headed by Senator Kerry drew the conclusion after one year of 
investigation that there was no evidence of American 
prisoners-of-wars living in detention camps in Vietnam. He also 
said 123 of 196 discrepancy cases had been solved. So, the four 
preconditions for lifting the trade embargo put forth by the 
U.S. President have been satisfied. So there is no reason for 
the continued U.S. embargo. 
  Senator Kerry said he would submit a report on his latest 
field study in Vietnam and raise that issue with President Bill 
Clinton. He also said that besides cooperating with the United 
States on the MIA issue, Vietnam was expanding its economic 
relations with other foreign countries. That is why the United 
States might lose the opportunity for doing business with 
Vietnam. Senator Kerry's viewpoint is shared by many 
politicians, scholars, and businessmen in the United States and 
other countries who have come to Vietnam.

  [Text] The United States, Belgium, and France have offered 
to sell the Philippines secondhand fighter jets. 
  General Lisandro Abadia, Armed Forces of the Philippines 
chief of staff, earlier said that the military is planning to 
buy up to 24 high-performance fighter interceptors and a modern 
radar system. Abadia admitted that at present the country is not 
capable of defending the air against any external aggression. 
  According to Air Force Chief Major General Nicasio 
Rodriguez, 
the United States and Belgium have offered their secondhand F-16 
fighter jets, while France is ready to sell the country its 
surplus Mirage jets. The Air Force also needs bigger 
helicopters for search and rescue missions. 
  Regarding counterinsurgency, Abadia said that because of the 
military's continued campaign, the number of New People's Army 
rebels has narrowed down to only 8,000.

  [Text] At least seven policemen and soldiers were wounded 
in Basilan last Saturday [22 January] in a series of firefights 
with suspected members of the Moro National Liberation Front 
(MNLF), the most serious breach of the interim cease fire agreed 
on by the government and the rebel group. 
  Although there had been earlier reports of encounters since 
the truce pact was forged, all of them were attributed either to 
communist rebels, "Lost commands" of the MNLF or the Moro 
Islamic Liberation Front. But belated reports reaching Camp 
Aguinaldo yesterday named the MNLF, with whom the government is 
holding peace talks to end two decades of secessionist 
rebellion, as the group involved in the firefights. 
  The reports said the first firefight occurred around 
lunchtime Saturday when troopers from the 11th Marine Battalion 
Landing Team (MBLT), the 468th police Mobile Force Company and 
the police Special Action Force were ambushed by about 50 
alleged MNLF rebels. 
  The soldiers and policemen were reportedly "moving towards 
Sitio [village district] Sapa Langay, Barangay [village] 
Cabengbeng, Sumisip," in Basilan when they were waylaid by the 
band. 
  A two-hour-long firefight ensued, resulting in the wounding 
of Pfc. (private first class) Felix Catedrilla. The attackers 
reportedly suffered an "undetermined" number of casualties. 
  The reports said the alleged rebels were led by Commanders 
Barahama Salih and Indasil Sahili. 
  Four hours later, the same group of soldiers, now already in 
Sitio Sapa Langay, were "harassed" by an "undetermined number of 
MNLF (rebels) for about ten minutes." 
  Wounded in the attack was Police Inspector Deven Seriales 
who 
was evacuated via helicopter to the Armed Forces Southern 
Command hospital. 
  A little over an hour later, the government troopers, still 
occupying the same sitio, were again attacked, this time by 
"heavily armed MNLF (rebels)" for about 15 minutes. 
  Wounded were Marine Corporal Leonardo Cuevas, PO (petty 
officer) 3 Mutalib Hamnsiraji, PO3 Abdul Hadjack Radhi, PO3 
Jesus Ramirez, and PO2 Eustaquio Ang. They were evacuated via 
patrol boat to the Isabela Hospital two hours after the 
gunbattle. 
  The 7 November interim cease fire agreement states that "the 
forces of both parties shall remain in their respective places 
and refrain from any provocative actions or any acts of 
hostilities." 
  Reporters tried but failed to contact MNLF spokesman Zain 
Jati, government chief negotiator Manuel Yan, and Southern 
Command officials. 
  Brigadier General Guillermo Ruiz, commander of the Marines 
in 
the South and co-chairman of joint cease fire committee, has 
said that "minor violations" on both sides had been reported, 
and that these would be addressed by the committee. 
  Under the proposed guidelines and ground rules of the cease 
fire agreement, the government and the MNLF will "mutually 
identify the location and unit commanders of their respective 
forces," which both sides agree will not be operated against by 
their forces. 
  The mere movement of government troops into MNLF held areas 
will constitute a violation. But the proposed guidelines have 
yet to be signed by either Yan or MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari, 
although the second draft has already been prepared and signed 
by Ruiz and MNLF co-chairman, Major General Abdul Sahrin.

  [Text] MNLF [Moro National Liberation Front] Chairman Nur 
Misuari finally signs the proposed guidelines and ground rules 
for the implementation of the cease-fire agreement. The 
government chief negotiator Manuel Yan describes the signing of 
the document as an encouraging development for the peace process. 
  Under the guidelines of the cease-fire accord, the 
government 
and the MNLF must identify the location and unit commanders of 
the respective forces. It has been agreed that the forces of 
both sides shall remain in their respective places and refrain 
from any provocative action. 
  The cease-fire document will be sent to Jakarta for the 
signature of the OIC [ICO -- Islamic Conference Organization] 
chairman, Ministerial Committee of Six. It will then go to 
Jeddah, where the OIC secretary general will sign the document. 
  Despite the cease-fire, however, government forces still 
have 
to cope with the presence of so-called MNLF "Lost Command" 
rebels. The other day, five police troopers were wounded in a 
series of clashes with renegade MNLF rebels in Basilan. The 
encounter occurred as DILG [Department of Interior and Local 
Government] Secretary Rafael Alunan III stressed that the 
operations in Basilan are purely police movements and not 
military offensives. The [word indistinct] military and police 
forces, Alunan says, are going after criminal elements engaged 
in piracy, murder, and kidnapping. The secretary also says the 
operations should not be viewed as a violation of the cease-fire 
agreement.

<F P=106> [By Bobby Timonera] </F>
  [Text] The National Democratic Front [NDF] yesterday said 
it was willing to resume exploratory talks for peace with the 
government, but continued to press demands the government has 
described as "unreasonable." 
  "The (NDF) is willing to resume exploratory talks on the 
basis of firm adherence to The Hague Declaration," said a faxed 
statement signed by Connie Ledesma, executive director of the 
leftist group's international office in Utrecht, The Netherlands. 
  Ledesma said that NDF negotiator Luis Jalandoni wrote 
Ambassador Howard Dee, head of the government panel, stressing 
the need for preliminary talks before the conduct of exploratory 
talks "to adequately resolve" some issues. 
  The NDF office in Utrecht is demanding that the government 
rescind Executive Order [EO] 125 which the rebels said limits 
the scope of the talks to the confines of the Constitution. 
  The NDF also demanded that the government stop "coddling" 
breakaway communist leaders. 
  The NDF statement also said the "deadline" set by the 
government was "totally unacceptable" to the NDF. Dee earlier 
said that if nothing happens to the negotiations by the end of 
the first quarter, the government may start talking with the 
other factions in the communist movement. 
  Ledesma said that the NDF panel's position was based on a 
memorandum on the conduct of exploratory talks issued by NDF 
Chairman Manuel Romero, believed to be the alias used by rebel 
leader Antonio Zumel who, together with Satur Ocampo, 
represented the NDF in the failed 1986 talks. 
  In the memorandum, Romero reportedly warned the current NDF 
negotiators not to be tricked by the "objectionable" EO 125 
which he said "delimits the... talks to the existing Philippine 
Constitution." 
  "(EO 125) must be withdrawn if the NDF is to proceed with 
the 
talks," Romero was quoted as saying. 
  Romero recalled that the same strategy was adopted by the 
Aquino administration in 1986, but the NDF panel "correctly 
rejected the proposition." 
  The NDF leadership, too, reminded Jalandoni that it should 
insist having equal say in all aspects of talks, including the 
choice of venue.

  [Excerpt] Heavily armed communist rebels raided a police 
detachment in Tarlac Saturday morning, capturing several assault 
rifles and assorted firearms, according to reports reaching the 
National Police operations center. A policeman, Police Officer 
3 Leody Ray Lumibao, and a militia man, Alfredo Lorenzo, were 
seriously wounded in the attack. 
  Political analysts considered the attack as significant 
since 
it was the first time that communist rebels mounted such an 
operation after their retreat to their mountain sanctuaries 
years ago. The communist-led New People's Army (NPA) was 
founded in Cepa, Tarlac, in March 1969 and it opted to use the 
Central Plains as a support base rather than a target for rebel 
attacks. 
  The reports said the rebels, numbering about 35, attacked 
the 
police detachment in Iba, San Jose, Tarlac, at about 7:45 A.M. 
At least four of the raiders were believed wounded in the 
exchange of fire. The rebels raided the detachment using two 
passenger jeepneys commandeered in San Jose, Tarlac, the reports 
said. The drivers, Nicolas Apan and Pedro Balagtas, have been 
held for "tactical interrogation" at the Tarlac PNP [Philippine 
National Police] headquarters. Four M-14 assault rifles, one 
M-16, four M-1 Garand rifles and one carbine were taken by the 
rebels from the policemen. 
  The PNP's 181st Mobile Force Company (MFC) is pursuing the 
withdrawing rebels, while the 185th MFC has set up a blocking 
force at the Capas-San Jose and the San Jose-Mayantoc boundaries. 
  Earlier, defense and military officials said that the 
government can achieve "strategic victory" within this year, 
claiming that the military has already regained control over 
several barangays [villages] formerly controlled by the CPP 
[Communist Party of the Philippines]-NPA. 
  The communist movement has suffered major setbacks after the 
popular revolt against the Marcos regime. It is currently being 
wracked by a major internal crisis. [passage omitted on

  [Text] Zamboanga City -- Southern Command Chief Lt. Gen. 
Thelmo Cunanan has ordered his commanders to tighten security in 
all public places in Mindanao. Cunanan gave the order following 
information that the group of terrorists responsible for the 
blasts at the San Pedro Cathedral and two Muslim mosques in 
Davao City last month has transferred operations to other areas. 
The military and police were ordered to secure places like 
churches, markets and groceries, where there are crowds. He 
asked the public to bear with the inconvenience and discomfort 
of checkpoints and inspections. 
  Meanwhile, Cunanan said police operations will continue 
against criminal elements despite the cease fire with the Moro 
National Liberation Front. 
  "We will pursue these criminal elements wherever they are. 
We are already taking action against them," Cunanan said. He 
said the extremist Abu Sayaf is one of the groups hunted by the 
military and the police. 
  As this developed, former Sulu Representative Sakur Tan 
confirmed that the Abu Sayaf group has increased in number and 
are equipped with highpowered armament. Tan, the principal 
negotiator in the release Monday of shipyard owner Ricardo Tong 
after 139 days of captivity, said he witnessed the gathering up 
of the Abu Sayaf group when he had a talk with two of the 
group's leaders somewhere in Patikul, Sulu.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 27 KYODO -- A group of academics on 
Thursday [27 January] criticized U.S. trade policy as hindering 
free market mechanisms in its demand for the setting of 
numerical targets. 
  The government should not bow to a U.S. request for setting 
"objective criteria" as a way to gauge the openness of Japan's 
markets, Kazuo Ueda, a professor of economics at the University 
of Tokyo, told a press conference. 
  The United States should retract such a request and Japan 
should reject it and express a strong determination to protect 
the free trading system as "a public good of the world," Ueda 
said. The move came against increasing U.S. demands for Tokyo 
to take action to break the stalled trade "framework" talks. 
  Ueda's group prepared a report in which they oppose what 
they 
view as the U.S. policy of managed trade. Ueda said allowing 
the bilateral framework talks to fail would be a better 
alternative for Japan than making "an easy compromise" under 
U.S. threats such as trade sanctions. 
  Motoshige Itoh said the blame should be put more on the 
Japanese Government for "erroneously" accepting a 20 percent 
foreign market share target in its chip trade talks with the 
U.S. "That was very dangerous for free trade," said Itoh, who 
is also a professor of economics at the University of Tokyo. 
  Ueda said it was "strategically" a mistake for Japan to have 
accepted "sets of objective criteria, either qualitative or 
quantitative or both" in the July 1993 summit between then Prime 
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  Ueda said the position paper, prepared last week, has 
already 
been distributed to about 170 Japanese scholars nationwide, of 
which 154 supported it and one opposed it. The paper will be 
sent to U.S. President Bill Clinton as well as the U.S. Trade 
Representative (USTR) and the Treasury Department, he said. 
  Japan's agreement to numerical trade targets would not serve 
its interest in any case, the paper said. If the step results 
in an import rise in one trade area, the U.S. may seek a similar 
request in other sectors, escalating government-led managed 
trade practices in order to meet the new demands, the paper said. 
  In the event of failure to meet a pledged goal, a probable 
result would be punitive measures by the U.S., the paper said. 
  To improve foreign access to Japanese markets, the paper 
proposed removing various government controls that hamper 
competition, such as restrictive business deals and unnecessary 
administrative rules and permits. Strict enforcement of the 
Antimonopoly Law, along with an easing of these regulations, 
would help reduce the prices gap between Japan and abroad, 
eventually serving the interest of Japan and foreign countries, 
it said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 27 KYODO -- Japanese and U.S. 
international telephone operators are on the verge of waging a 
war that could escalate into an intergovernmental dispute. 
Japan's three common carriers submitted a petition Thursday [27 
January] to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications 
requesting an investigation into discount services offered in 
Japan by U.S. firms. 
  Meanwhile, three Japanese agents of the U.S. firms told 
KYODO NEWS SERVICE that they have agreed to file a complaint 
with the office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) if 
restrictions are placed on their services. 
  For the Japanese Government, the bickering comes at a 
crucial 
time as U.S. negotiators are threatening possible sanctions if 
the ongoing framework trade talks fail to reach an agreement 
before President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa hold their summit in Washington on February 11. 
  "We are confident that we will not have to take such 
actions," said Toshio Kawakami, president of USF Pacific Inc., 
stressing that its discount services are legal both domestically 
and internationally. 
  "But if the ministry decides to restrict our services, we 
will have to explain to our parent U.S. firms preparing to file 
a complaint," he said. 
  The Tokyo agent to New York-based US Fibercom Network Inc. 
began operations in October with a call-back service offering 
up to 40 percent lower rates than the three Japanese carriers. 
  The two other agents are International Network Services Inc. 
for USA Global Link in Iowa, and Telecom System Co. for 
International Telephone Co. in New York. 
  The Japanese carriers, led by KDD, a former international 
telecommunications monopoly, said in a joint statement that the 
call-back system "unfairly uses their lines free of charge and 
causes trouble to their customers by making lines busy." 
  The two other Japanese carriers are International Digital 
Communications Inc. and International Telecom Japan Inc. 
  In the past two years, U.S. discount services entered Japan 
with the call-back system. The user calls a switching center in 
the United States and hangs up after two rings. After a few 
seconds, the center calls back and the user dials the number he 
wishes to call, thereby making the U.S. the country of origin. 
  Back in the U.S., the operators lease lines from major 
carriers like American Telephone and Telegraph Co. under 
discount contracts for large-lot users in order to offer cheap 
international telephone rates to individuals and companies. 
  Under a written agreement, the three agents are to "continue 
offering the call-back service with an aim to further spread the 
advanced U.S. telecommunications service in Japan." 
  "We will agree to hold friendly talks" with the three 
Japanese firms and the ministry, "but are prepared to ask for 
help, while explaining the situation in Japan to the USTR, the 
U.S. Embassy in Tokyo and other U.S. Government institutions 
that support our call- back service," Kawakami said. 
  Kawakami stressed that the service brings benefits of the 
yen's appreciation and deregulations to Japanese companies now 
actively streamlining amid the prolonged economic slump. 
  ''This is one of the key policies'' of the government of 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, and the services ''also help 
Japan in reducing its current-account surplus with the United 
States,'' he said. 
  But the share is still very small at less than 1 percent of 
the 250 billion yen market in Japan, Kawakami said. 
  A KDD spokesman described the service as ''abnormal,'' 
stressing that the lines are used free of charge. 
  Kawakami said the three agents have also sent a joint notice 
to the ministry and the Japanese companies indicating they are 
prepared to pay if reasonable rates are presented. 
  ''We haven't received such notice yet, but will in any case 
seek restrictions on the services,'' the spokesman said. 
  Ministry officials had said the discount services are no 
problem under the existing telecommunications licensing system, 
and the ministry has no control over rates provided by overseas 
switching facilities. 
  In fact, the ministry issued permission to the three firms. 
  Telecommunications licenses are divided into two main types 
-- one for common carriers, obliging them to submit rates for 
ministry approval, and one allowing the free fixing of rates for 
those providing service without possessing domestic switching 
machines and lines. 
  But the officials had hinted at problems concerning `civil 
laws'.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 27 KYODO -- Nippon Telegraph and 
Telephone Corp. (NTT) on Thursday [27 January] denied a 
newspaper report that it is planning to tie up with American 
Telephone and Telegraph Co. (AT and T) and Apple Computer Inc. 
in the fields of multimedia communications and miniature 
personal computers with telecommunications functions. 
  "No talks are under way between NTT and the two U.S. 
companies on the reported tie-up plans," said a spokesman for 
the domestic telecommunications giant. 
  NTT announced Wednesday it will acquire a stake in General 
Magic Inc., a California-based multimedia software development 
house, in a move to develop multimedia technology. 
  Among main investors in General Magic, which was founded in 
May 1990, are American Telephone and Telegraph Co., (AT and T), 
Apple Computer Inc., Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. and Sony 
Corp. 
  The NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN, a major business daily, reported 
in 
a front-page article Thursday that NTT is considering teaming up 
directly with AT and T and Apple. 
  NTT and AT and T are expected to set up a joint venture to 
launch multimedia communications services in Japan that is 
likely to offer advanced electronic mail services similar to 
those to be supplied by AT and T in the United States from this 
summer, the daily said. 
  In order to commercialize new businesses involving advanced 
telecom services and miniature personal computers with telecom 
functions in Japan, NTT thinks it essential to introduce 
techniques for software development from leading U.S. firms, 
according to the newspaper. 
  In the area of miniature personal computers, a subsidiary 
called NTT Mobile Communications Network Inc. (NTT Docomo) is 
planning to link up with Apple on interface technology linking 
such gadgets with pocket pagers, the daily said. 
  NTT Docomo will develop modem cards with paging functions to 
incorporate them in Apple's Newton miniature personal computers 
with telecom functions, it said.

<F P=106> [Ian Verchere: "Japan Talks to U.S. But Keeps Europe At Bay"] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo -- The success of US trade representative 
Mickey Kantor in forcing Japan to open its $20 billion-a-year 
public construction market to foreign corporations has been 
hailed as a major success for the Clinton administration's 
get-tough trade policy. 
  However, it has once again served to highlight Europe's 
comparative impotence in dealing with Tokyo on matters of trade. 
In a concerted bid to break into Japan's obdurate business 
culture, Washington has threatened Japan with trade sanctions if 
it fails to reform the bidding process by which it has 
historically excluded foreign contractors. 
  In an eleventh-hour move last week, the government of Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa announced a plan to increase the 
openness and fairness of its construction market. The 
concession comes on the eve of further US-Japan bilateral trade 
negotiations next month at which Washington will press Japan to 
open its markets to American cars and components and provide 
greater access for its semiconductor manufacturers. 
  Progress on these and other trade-related matters are being 
closely monitored by the European Union [EU],which faces similar 
problems in its relations with Japan. 
  Despite the illusion of unity created by a single market, 
however, the interests of the Union's 12 member states are still 
far too diverse and uncoordinated for any comparable moves by 
Brussels. Playing governments off against each other is an old 
Japanese sport to which there is really only one solution: total 
European union. The difficulty in achieving a more unified 
stance is that while some countries seek protection from 
Japanese imports, others are eager to attract Japanese 
investment. 
  Yet Washington's problems of greater market access and a 
huge 
trade imbalance with Japan are no less real for the economies of 
the European Union. This has seen the Union's trade deficit 
increase from $18.5 billion in 1990 to $31.2 billion in 1992 
which, despite a small improvement in 1993, is equivalent to 3.2 
per cent of Japan's economic output. Indeed, a feeling persists 
among many Union manufacturers that Japan still tends to favour 
US exporters to the detriment of Europe. 
  "If Airbus Industrie has achieved a 30 per cent share of the 
world civil aircraft market," asks Bernhard Salzer, chairman of 
the European Parliament's trade delegation to Japan, "why is the 
corresponding share in Japan only ten per cent? And why has 
Rolls-Royce sold no aircraft engines in Japan since 1970?" 
  Japan is a master at denying foreign firms access to its 
local markets. The techniques employed in targeting the 
economies of so-called trading partners while simultaneously 
protecting their own have varied from the unwritten 
"administrative guidelines" issued by the much-vaunted Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry (MITI), to the spoiling 
tactics of an overzealous customs service. 
  Every embassy in Tokyo has its own favourite tales of the 
ruses employed by Japan and its compliant bureaucracy at denying 
foreign companies the right of entry to the world's second 
largest economy. Through the pretence of language difficulties, 
cultural misunderstandings and the invisible hand of government 
officials dedicated to keeping foreign companies out, Japan has 
long enjoyed the dual benefits of a protected domestic economy 
coupled with easy access to most foreign ones. 
  Through its mission in Tokyo, the European Commission 
battles 
for reforms and the removal of these obstacles which, says the 
Union's chief trade negotiator Sir Leon Brittan, "are simply 
unacceptable in an open trading system". 
  The most frequent complaint of European companies is the 
over-dependence of Japanese companies and government agencies on 
traditional suppliers -- usually Japanese -- and the refusal to 
explore the possibility of working with new ones. Others point 
to the long list of excluded sectors and exemptions contained in 
the country's anti-monopoly law and to its over-burdensome 
regulations. 
  Prior to Kantor's recent successes, these have been 
particularly marked in the area of public procurement. 
According to the Commission, there are specific procedural 
obstacles for foreign companies -- most notably the system of 
prequalification and the demands for very high guarantees -- 
which effectively exclude foreign companies. 
  As the pressure on Japan to adopt more liberal trading 
practices has mounted down the years, its exclusion techniques 
have become more sophisticated and obtuse. The major hotels of 
downtown Tokyo have grown rich on the steady stream of foreign 
businessmen and government delegations attending this or that 
trade conference seeking ways of penetrating Japan's invisible 
trade barriers. 
  Creating joint committees and working groups to investigate 
trade and protectionist grievances is a stalling tactic well 
known to anyone acquainted with the intractable problems of 
doing business with Japan. While the world is now a little 
wiser to these ploys, it is remarkable how many gaijins 
(foreigners) succumb to the charms of Japanese hospitality and 
still come away believing they have wrung concessions from their 
hosts. 
  "It can be depressing to look at the past," notes the EC's 
chief trade negotiator. "Over the past 15 years, Japan has 
pushed through a total of 13 economic packages to stimulate 
growth and reduce the trade imbalance. And yet the surplus has 
barely diminished. In 1992, it represented 3.2 per cent of 
Japanese gross domestic product (GDP) and was over 3.5 per cent 
of GDP in early 1993." 
  As Europe's trade deficit with Japan hit a new high of $35 
billion in 1990, the Union demanded that Tokyo take immediate 
steps to reduce this lopsided situation by opening its markets 
to European exporters and removing the barriers that frustrate 
commerce. The outcome of subsequent EC-Japan talks in July 1991 
was another classic piece of highminded diplomatic rhetoric 
backed by little substance which, say critics, will probably 
achieve very little. 
  After more than two years of "co-operation and partnership", 
the reality is still a yawning chasm in trade volumes as 
Japanese ships dump huge quantities of manufactured goods at 
European ports and return home with Plimsoll lines well above 
sea level. 
  Taking inter-dependence to its logical conclusion, insists 
Brittan, the 20 million unemployed in Europe are as much Japan's 
problems as they are Europe's. 
  As Japan's economic fortunes wane and recession bites 
deeper, 
however, there are signs of greater understanding and humility 
from the Tokyo side. Once quick to dismiss trade difficulties 
as more about the inability of foreign firms to understand 
Japanese markets and meet the high standards of the Japanese 
consumer, the beleagured Hosokawa government has already shown a 
greater willingness to address some of these longstanding 
grievances than most of its predecessors. 
  For Europe, the creation of a single market is also helping 
the EU to organise a framework of contacts and an agenda for 
negotiations with Japan. Inevitably, such efforts continue to 
focus on trade where -- although recession in Europe and a 
strong yen have temporarily arrested the slide -- the underlying 
imbalance continues to exacerbate relations between the two side. 
  Unlike the US's tougher line, the Commission is adopting a 
softer, less confrontational approach in the hope of benefiting 
from the new political mood now pervading Japan. Known as the 
trade assessment mechanism (TAM), it focuses less on questions 
of market share in given industrial sectors and more on a joint 
EC-Japan analysis of specific products and how they perform. 
  "The idea," explains the Commission's Tokyo spokesman Gerard 
Legris, "is to detect products which do not enjoy the same 
market share in Japan as elsewhere. Selection is on statistical 
criteria rather than partisan interest and aims to provide a 
representative basket. 
  "Having mutually agreed those areas or products," he adds, 
"we then analyse the factors behind this poor showing. It may 
well be that the fault lies with Europe, or it may be with the 
Japanese." 
  The Commission hopes this will allow both sides to identify 
trouble spots and agree remedial steps. It also believes this 
pianissimo approach is essential if the Commission is to gain 
the cooperation of Japanese ministries and avoid tying the 
exercise to the specific problems of individual companies. 
Several TAM meetings have already occurred in Brussels and 
Tokyo and their findings are due to be discussed at the next 
round of EU-Japan ministerial meetings. 
  Once again, Japan's priority is on the US dispute in 
readiness for the Hosokawa-Clinton summit on 11 February with no 
date agreed for the European talks. Are Europe's interests, 
therefore, once again playing second fiddle to Washington's? 
  The strategy of a country which produces 16 per cent of 
global GNP but attracts only one per cent of direct foreign 
investment has never been hard to fathom. Europe must learn 
that, to the Confucian mind, a paper tiger poses no threat.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 27 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Thursday [27 January] urged bureaucrats to improve 
the procedures for government procurements, which have been 
criticized by Japan's trade partners for being unclear, 
officials said. Hosokawa made the call at a special government 
committee to discuss trade issues that require a cross-ministry 
approach. 
  The committee is expected to decide on a new action program 
for making the government procurement process more transparent 
and fair at the next meeting on February 3, the officials said. 
The backbone of the measures will be the compiling of a manual 
for the procedures and creation of a database for bidding 
information, they said. 
  Hosokawa will present the measures to U.S. President Bill 
Clinton when they meet on February 11. The latest steps will 
cover all the government's procurements of goods, but not 
services. 
  The subcabinet-level committee, which held its first meeting 
in August 1985, was set up to handle trade issues that require 
cooperation and cordination among ministries and agencies.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 27 KYODO -- A high-speed railway 
between Beijing and Shanghai is among the 70 projects that the 
Chinese Government has unofficially proposed to Japan for 
financing with Japan's fourth package of yen loans, government 
sources said Thursday [27 January]. 
  The three-year loan program is to be implemented from fiscal 
1996 starting in April 1996. 
  Under a Chinese plan, a Japanese Shinkansen-type high-speed 
railway will be built by the year 2000 between Beijing and 
Shanghai at a cost of 1 trillion yen, the sources said. 
  Trains running at maximum speed of 250 kilometers per hour 
on 
the 1,200-kilometer railway are expected to cut traveling time 
between the two cities to six hours, one-third the present time. 
  The Japanese Government is expected to select Chinese 
projects for application of the loans before Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa visits China, probably in mid-March, the 
sources said. 
  Under its third package of yen loans to China between fiscal 
1990 and 1995, Japan is providing 810 billion yen to finance 42 
projects.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 27 KYODO -- Japan has begun 
considering a resumption of economic assistance to Myanmar 
[Burma], Foreign Ministry sources said Thursday [27 January]. 
But they stressed that the extension of new official 
development assistance (ODA) to Myanmar, formerly Burma, awaits 
more "tangible developments" in terms of its moves toward 
restoration of democracy and improvements in its human rights 
situation. 
  "In principle, our bilateral assistance remains suspended, 
except for humanitarian and emergency assistance rendered on a 
case-by-case basis," said one source. 
  The sources said Japan welcomes the Myanmar military junta's 
holding earlier this month, after a four-month break, of a 
national convention charged with drawing up a new constitution. 
But they said the timetable for completion of the constitution 
and a transfer of power to a new democratic government remains 
unclear. 
  The sources said that while some political prisoners have 
been released by the junta, it is not known when Nobel Peace 
Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi will be released from house 
arrest. Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) won a 
landslide victory in parliamentary elections in May 1990, but 
the junta, governing as the State Law and Order Restoration 
Council (SLORC), nullified the results. She has been under 
house arrest since July 1989. 
  SLORC leader Lt. General Khin Nyunt told Japanese 
journalists last week that a five-year limit on house arrest 
would be reached in July, but did not clarify if Suu Kyi would 
be released then. 
  One ministry source said the Myanmar junta "should be 
commended to some extent" for its recent moves in the direction 
of openness. 
  "But to more seriously consider resumption of ODA we need to 
see more tangible developments," the source said. He said Japan 
wants "to encourage Myanmar to further open its society and 
ameliorate the human rights situation, and to promote the 
transfer of power." 
  Japan, long Myanmar's largest benefactor, joined other major 
donor nations in suspending economic assistance in 1988 after 
the army killed hundreds of pro-democracy protesters. But early 
the following year it broke ranks and decided to continue with 
economic assistance already pledged, which by some calculations 
totaled in excess of 100 billion yen. 
  There are views in the Japanese Government that new official 
yen loans should be resumed if Suu Kyi is released and allowed 
to undertake some measure of political activities, the sources 
said. 
  They said there also exist views that the restoration of 
such 
assistance would help stabilize the Myanmar economy, which would 
in turn facilitate the promotion of democracy. Between 1973 and 
1988, Japan provided more than two-thirds of all bilateral ODA 
disbursements to Myanmar.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 21 KYODO -- Japan will extend a total 
of some 129 million yen to Pakistan for debt relief and a 
project to construct bridges in the northwest frontier province, 
the Foreign Ministry said Friday [21 January]. 
  Japanese parliamentary Vice Foreign Minister Syozo Azuma and 
Pakistani Government officials exchanged documents on the 
agreement in Islamabad, the ministry said. 
  The aid includes 115 million yen to cover debts for which 
repayment fell due in the first half of fiscal 1993, but on 
which capital and rescheduled interest has not yet been paid, it 
said. The aid package also includes 14 million yen to support 
Pakistan's project to construct bridges in the northwest 
frontier province, which has many valleys and rivers. 
  The latest assistance brought the total amount of Japanese 
grant- in-aid to Pakistan in fiscal 1993 to 4.9 billion yen, the 
ministry said.

  [Text] Speaking at a hastily called meeting of the Private 
Sector Political Reform Council this afternoon, Prime Minister 
Hosokawa said that if political reform is not carried out as he 
has promised the people, he would not cling to the post of prime 
minister at all. In this way, he indicated his strong resolve to 
come to grips with the political reform at the risk of his 
political future. 
  [Begin Hosokawa recording] If the political reform is not 
carried out, I have no intention of hanging on to the post of 
prime minister at all. If the political reform, which has 
repeatedly been debated in the past five years, is left buried 
because of minor differences, we will probably not have an 
opportunity again to carry it out. Now, both the ruling and 
opposition parties are holding a joint committee meeting of both 
houses of the Diet and I intend to call on President Kono of the 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party to hold a top-level meeting 
with me to discuss ways to handle a package of political reform 
bills. (end recording)

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 27 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Thursday [27 January] denied opposition allegations 
that the government's bill to revamp the system for electing 
Diet members is secretly aimed at slashing the parliamentary 
strength of opposition parties. 
  "Our efforts to attain reform are not aimed at causing a 
power struggle or horse-trading among political parties or 
factions," Hosokawa told a meeting of the Committee for the 
Promotion of Political Reforms, a private panel of business 
executives, academics and journalists. 
  His remarks came in response to opposition attacks on his 
plan to replace the current 511-member House of Representatives 
with a 500-seat mixture of single-seat constituencies and 
proportional representation as favoring the coalition partners, 
especially Shinseito [Japan Reneewal Party] and Komeito. 
  Hosokawa told the meeting, "I will not remain prime minister 
for a minute if political reform is not achieved." The remark 
was immediately taken as implying his readiness to disband the 
cabinet and resign if he fails to secure the opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party's consent to hammer out a compromise version of 
his reform package. 
  Minutes after the meeting, however, Hosokawa recanted his 
statement, telling reporters in the premier's official 
residence, "I only uttered something as a matter of course as a 
general statement." 
  "I am not thinking of dissolving the House of 
Representatives 
for a general election or of disbanding my cabinet," Hosokawa 
said. 
  The meeting was called two days before the current Diet 
session is to close on Saturday -- Hosokawa's self-imposed 
deadline for pushing his package through the Diet.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 27 KYODO -- The leader of the largest 
party in the ruling coalition reiterated opposition Thursday [27 
January] to the possible dissolution and subsequent general 
elections for the House of Representatives in the event that 
political reform bills are killed. Social Democratic Party 
[SDP] Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, speaking at a meeting with a 
pro-SDP group of labor leaders, said the Japanese people do not 
want to see a political vacuum emerge during a severe economic 
slump. 
  Murayama said the seven-party coalition led by Prime 
Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa should first compile and enact a third 
supplementary budget for fiscal 1993, ending March 31, and the 
fiscal 1994 budget, both of which have yet to be submitted to 
the Diet. 
  The House of Councillors last week rejected a package of 
four 
government-sponsored political reform bills which passed the 
House of Representatives in November. 
  Hosokawa has vowed to "take political responsibility" if his 
Cabinet fails to achieve political reform during the current 
Diet session ending January 29, implying that he and his Cabinet 
will resign en masse. Some of the ruling parties have called 
for dissolving the lower house for an election if the bills are 
killed.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 27 KYODO -- The last-minute talks 
between ruling and opposition parties over political reform 
bills ended in failure Thursday [27 January] midnight with both 
sides rejecting compromise plans at a joint council of both Diet 
houses. 
  Yuichi Ichikawa, a chief negotiator for the coalition 
parties 
who chaired the council, declared an end to a series of talks 
which had continued intermittently since Wednesday to iron out a 
concessionary plan to salvage the government's reform package by 
the Saturday deadline but failed to reach agreement on how to 
amend the bills. 
  After the end of the talks at the council, leaders of the 
seven coalition parties and the government were meeting to work 
out a new strategy to help realize Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's commitment to political reform. Hosokawa told 
reporters he will propose a meeting with Yohei Kono, president 
of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), in a 
last-ditch effort to enact the reform measures. 
  The LDP, rejecting the compromise plan offered by the ruling 
parties at the joint committee, presented its own reform plan 
before the end of the day. But the coalition parties also 
turned it down, saying it lacks strict anti-corruption measures 
necessary to alter Japan's politics, notorious for repeated 
bribery scandals involving key figures. 
  The coalition could now call a second vote on the bills in 
the House of Representatives on Friday, coalition sources said. 
The bills, which were passed by the lower house last November 
but rejected by the House of Councillors last Friday, would 
become law if two-thirds of the powerful lower house members 
approve them. 
  The bills would become law if two-thirds of the members of 
the joint council approve a compromise plan and the amended 
bills pass the lower and upper houses by Saturday. The joint 
council is made up of 20 members -- 10 lower house members who 
voted in favor of the reform package and 10 upper house members 
who voted against it, including seven LDP members. 
  Hosokawa, who staked his premiership on enacting the bills, 
said earlier in the day that he would not hesitate to step down 
if his political reform campaign fails. He told a meeting on 
political reform that, "I will not stick for a minute to the 
post of prime minister if political reform is not realized." 
  Since taking office as premier last August after dislodging 
the LDP from its 38-year grip on power, Hosokawa has vowed to 
get the bills passed by the end of the current Diet session. If 
he fails to do so, he could be forced to resign or dissolve the 
lower house to win a new mandate, political analysts said. 
  The LDP's offer would increase the number of single-seat 
constituencies in the lower house to 300 from 274 in the 
original electoral reform bill, as well as cut the number of 
proportional representation seats to 171 from 226. This 
compares with the coalition's compromise plan which calls for 
280 for single-seat and 220 for proportional representation 
seats. 
  At present the lower house has 511 seats, all elected from 
multiseat constituencies and with no proportional 
representation. In addition, the LDP plan would split the seats 
under proportional representation into 47 prefectural units 
while the coalition proposed breaking them into seven electoral 
units, instead of a single nationwide electoral unit in the 
original bill. 
  On political fund-raising, the LDP said political donations 
by an enterprise or a group to a maximum of 240,000 yen a year 
to individual politician's two fund-raising bodies should be 
allowed. But the coalition said it could only backpedal from a 
blanket ban on corporate donations to individual politicians in 
the original bill by allowing members of local assemblies to 
accept such donations for five years after the reform bills are 
enacted.

  [Text] Osaka, Jan. 27 KYODO -- Takenori Matsumoto, the 
man who will head operations at the Kansai International Airport 
when it opens in September, plans to develop Japan's first 
24-hour airport as a hub linking Japan with Asia and foreign 
countries elsewhere. 
  The former Transport Ministry official pointed out in an 
interview that the airport is in closer proximity to other Asian 
countries than Japan's busiest international airport at Narita 
near Tokyo. 
  The airport has been built on a man-made island five 
kilometers off the Senshu District of Osaka Prefecture. 
  Matsumoto, who assumed his post at the beginning of the 
month, predicted the airport will be a boon for those coming 
from local areas to make connections with international lines 
since it will also serve domestic lines. 
  In contrast, the new Tokyo international airport, located 
east of Tokyo in Chiba Prefecture, has very few domestic lines 
so many passengers must commute the considerable distance 
between it and Tokyo's domestic airport at Haneda. 
  Matsumoto, who has lengthy experience in promoting airplane 
safety measures, said the Kansai airport will be a "faultless" 
one when it comes to air safety. 
  Matsumoto, 49, said the only thing that concerns him is the 
fact that side winds can reportedly be quite strong at times.

  [Text] The Defense Ministry, in connection with rumors 
regarding the deployment of Patriot antimissile batteries, said 
"it seems that the U.S. Army is positively reviewing plans to 
ship defensive antimissile batteries to the ROK as part of the 
plan for U.S. Forces in the ROK." 
  The Defense Ministry, however, said that "there has been no 
discussion or agreement yet on the timing and scale of the 
deployment of Patriot antimissile batteries," and added that 
"the ROK and the United States will, in the future, closely 
confer on the issue."

<F P=106> [Article by Yi Chin-hui] </F>
  [Text] Signs of change are appearing in the U.S. defense 
policy for the Korean peninsula. 
  Testifying before the U.S. Senate Information Committee 
meeting on 25 January, CIA Director Woolsey said that the United 
States has sent and begun operations for a U.S. national 
intelligence support team on the Korean peninsula. The NEW YORK 
TIMES then reported that the United States will deploy Patriot 
missiles, commonly known as the "missile-killing missile," for 
the U.S. Forces in the ROK. 
  These moves are surfacing at a time when the U.S. Congress, 
which began its new session on 25 January, deliberates over a 
new U.S. defense policy toward the ROK, including further 
withdrawal of U.S. ground forces. These moves particularly draw 
our attention because they show that the U.S. defense policy is 
taking into account North Korea's nuclear issue which is 
expected to be resolved sometime early this year. 
  In accordance with the so-called "Bottom-up" plan of 
comprehensively reviewing post Cold-War U.S. defense policy, the 
U.S. Forces in the ROK submitted a report to the Department of 
Defense in November last year meticulously analyzing their 
defense capabilities, problems, and complementary measures. In 
the report, the U.S. Forces in the ROK noted a problem in the 
combat deployment of reinforcements from the U.S. mainland in 
the event of war on the Korean peninsula, and stressed a need 
for supplementary measures to cut off the enemy's spearhead of 
attack. 
  Therefore, the strengthening of intelligence capabilities of 
the U.S. Forces in the ROK and the request for the deployment of 
Patriot missiles must have some bearing on this operational 
review. In particular, in the event of punitive military action 
against the North with North Korea's continued rejection of 
nuclear inspections, the Patriot missiles will be a unique 
military countermeasure to North Korea's Nodong-1 and Nodong-2 
missiles. Even if the United States does not wage a direct 
military attack on North Korea, the presence of Patriot missiles 
can serve as a strong message on U.S. resolve to settle the 
North Korean nuclear issue. 
  However, whether the deployment of the Patriot missiles can 
effect the success the United States desires is doubtful. The 
Patriot missiles were deployed for an actual war in 1984. Since 
they were first put to use in an actual war during the Gulf war, 
much has been said about their efficiency. While some evaluated 
the Patriot missile positively as a "ghost-catching missile," 
many people have pointed out that the Patriot missile's 
target-hitting accuracy is only about ten percent and that there 
are many problems in removing shell fragments. 
  Whether the deployment of the Patriot missiles is suitable 
for the Korean peninsula's ground configuration should be 
reviewed. Some military experts hold that due to the lack of 
battlefield depth with Seoul less than 40 km away from the 
Armistice Line, the efficiency of the Patriot missile's air 
interception rate will not reach that of the Gulf war. 
  U.S. intentions on enforcing the deployment of Patriot 
missiles in the ROK is somewhat doubtful as the deployment of 
Patriot missiles can aggravate tension between North and South 
Korea at a time when U.S.-North Korea nuclear negotiations are 
nearing conclusion and nuclear negotiations between the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and North Korea are in 
progress. Furthermore, some point out that the deployment of 
Patriot missiles may be part of a "sophisticated sale strategy" 
of the Clinton administration aimed at handing over the Patriot 
missiles to the ROK Army following their deployment in the ROK 
by U.S. Forces. This claim by military experts is not entirely 
groundless when considering the Patriot missile system's price 
of $150 billion (120 billion won) and their narrow foreign 
market. 
  Apparently, the inauguration of a U.S. national intelligence 
support team in the ROK derives from the U.S. policy to augment 
the intelligence-gathering capacity of U.S. Forces in the ROK as 
well as from their assessment that North Korea's nuclear issue 
is more serious than previously thought. In a testimony to 
Congress, Director Woolsey said that North Korea possesses 
enough plutonium to produce at least one nuclear bomb and that 
it has acquired the technology to load nuclear bombs on MiG-23 
planes. This warrants the collection and analysis of more 
accurate and precise intelligence on the suspicion of North 
Korea's nuclear development. 
  In particular, the importance of appraising and analyzing 
intelligence on the Korean peninsula is more actually felt when 
considering the fact that U.S. aerial photographs provided the 
intelligence on North Korea's two unreported nuclear facilities 
which caused North Korea to withdraw from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 27 (YONHAP) -- North Korean and U.S. 
scientists and technicians met at the Neutral Nations 
Supervisory Commission (NNSC) office in the truce village of 
Panmunjom on Wednesday and agreed to exchange technical 
information on the remains of U.N. Forces listed as missing or 
killed in the Korean war (1950-53), a United Nations Command 
spokesman said Thursday. It was the first meeting between the 
two to discuss returning and identifying the remains of U.N. 
Forces killed in the Korean war, the spokesman said. 
  The contact has aroused widespread interest as the North 
Korean nuclear problem is nearing resolution, although the 
return of remains is a humanitarian matter. The two agreed to 
continue to meet to exchange technical information whenever 
necessary and to discuss forming a joint North Korea-U.S. 
investigation team. 
  More than 10,000 U.N. soldiers are listed as dead or missing 
in the Korean war. Although 194 purported sets of remains have 
been returned by North Korea, there has been little progress in 
identifying them.

  [Text] Washington, Jan. 26 (YONHAP) -- The U.S. State 
Department confirmed Tuesday that Kim Chong-hwi, a former senior 
secretary to President No Tae-u, has applied for permanent 
residency in the United States. Washington will accept Seoul's 
request that it not issue Kim a residence permit, a senior 
official at the South Korean Embassy said Tuesday. 
  The State Department notified the embassy that Kim has 
applied for a resident's permit and said that it will deal 
prudently with the application by Kim, who is suspected of 
taking bribes related to Korea's military build-up program, the 
official said. 
  "It will take a little time for us to receive an official 
confirmation from the U.S. State Department, I guess," he said. 
"But it is clear that Kim did not ask for political asylum in 
the United States." 
  The Korean Government has explained to the U.S. Government 
that Kim is wanted for prosecution in Seoul and has asked it to 
deal cautiously with any application to extend his visa or for a 
residence permit, according to the official. 
  "The U.S. reaction was that it will make a decision on the 
problem through prudent internal discussion," he said. 
  In the notification, the State Department did not reveal the 
date, place or content of Kim's application, but embassy 
officials think it was made this year. 
  Kim went to Washington as a guest researcher at the Heritage 
Foundation in April last year and stayed when he was implicated 
in irregularities in the Yulgok (military modernization) project.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 27 (YONHAP) -- Australia has been 
holding informal and tentative discussions with North Korea on 
renewing diplomatic relations at Pyongyang's initiative, Acting 
Australian Foreign Minister Gordon Bilney said Thursday. But 
there were three conditions to taking the talks further, he said 
in an exclusive interview with YONHAP News Agency. 
  "...There are a number of conditions... Including exclusive 
adherence to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
safeguards, a resolution of its difficulties with the South 
Koreans, and progressing its relations with the United States," 
Bilney said in a written interview relayed through the 
Australian Embassy here. 
  The talks were held "in recent weeks in Southeast Asian 
capitals," according to Bilney. 
  "We're not acting alone -- we're not going solo on any 
particular initiative," he said, adding that Australia is 
officially conferring with the concerned parties such as the 
United States and South Korea. 
  Canberra and Pyongyang established diplomatic relations in 
July 1974 but North Korea unilaterally closed its mission in 
Australia in October 1975, when Canberra backed South Korea's 
bid for membership in the United Nations. Australia followed 
suit one month later. 
  "The fact is that the initiative did come from North Korea," 
Bilney said when asked who took the first step. 
  Australia chose to play a part in talking with North Korea, 
Bilney said, because of his country's role in the region and 
Australia's position as chairman of the IAEA Board of Governors. 
  Asked about possible advantages in reopening ties with North 
Korea, he said, "I think it's far too early to speculate about 
those things."

rescued from a drifting North Korean boat 5 miles off 
Paengnyong-do Island in the West Sea by South Korean naval ships 
on Thursday morning, a Navy spokesman said. The pair, who 
appear to be North Koreans in their 20s, have been hospitalized. 
If they regain consciousness, they will be given the option of 
returning to North Korea or remaining free in the South. The 
1-ton ship, 1.5-meters long and 3.5-meters wide, seems to be 
from Yuk-to Island and was towed to Paengnyong-do, the spokesman 
said.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 27 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government has estimated North Korea's foodgrain production last 
year at 3.88 million tons, down 9 percent from 1992. 
  The Rural Development Administration said in a report on 
North Korean food production in 1993, released Thursday, that 
the Communist country is reckoned to have suffered a 34-percent 
decrease in rice production to 1.32 million tons, a 51-percent 
drop in corn production to 1.96 million tons and a 15-percent 
fall in production of other grains to 600,000 tons. The report 
attributed North Korea's sharp foodgrain production decrease 
last year to the unusually cold summer and said the North Korean 
people would suffer from the worst food shortage since the early 
1980s. 
  Estimating North Korea's foodgrain demand at 6.67 million 
tons this year, the report said the internationally isolated 
society's shortage in the coming year would be no less than 2.79 
million tons.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 27 (YONHAP) -- Retired opposition leader 
Kim Tae-chung, now chairman of a high-profile research 
Institute, called for an early inter-Korean summit Thursday, 
saying such a meeting would be a "success in itself." The 
summit may well come this or early next year after a series of 
inter-Korean exchanges across all sectors, after which the 
United States, Japan and other Western nations could improve 
relations with North Korea, he said. 
  "The summit between the rulers of South and North Korea, 
President Kim Yong-sam and leader Kim Il-song, must be realized 
as soon as possible," Kim said in his keynote speech 
inaugurating his peace foundation for the Asia-Pacific region. 
  "They must have the sense of spirit that a nation is the 
most 
important of all and erase misunderstanding and distrust to open 
the way for reconciliation and cooperation," he said. 
  The very fact of the two leaders meeting some 50 years after 
national division would be a dramatic event, a monumental 
success, said Kim. 
  People must solve all pending issues between them as fellow 
human beings of the same nation once the nuclear problem is 
resolved, Kim said, neighboring countries can only cooperate, 
not lead the Korean reunification process. 
  Inter-Korean exchanges should start with possible economic 
tieups, then build up to family reunions, cultural and social 
exchanges, Kim suggested. 
  "Peaceful coexistence requires continuous arms reduction and 
scrutinous inspection," said Kim. "It's important to create the 
conditions for peaceful coexistence and national reconciliation 
through these measures instead of military confrontation."

  [Text] The government will draft a special legislation by 
the end of this year to cover various issues relating to the 
reunification of South and North Korea, including solutions to 
disputes over property rights. 
  It will also establish a special task force to streamline 
the 
nation's legislation to deal with international regulations in 
the aftermath of the conclusion of the Uruguay Round 
negotiations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT). 
  The judicial agenda for this year was contained in a report 
submitted yesterday by Justice Minister Kim Tu-hui to President 
Kim Yong-sam at Chongwadae. 
  In the report, Minister Kim said that there is an implicit 
need for establishing criterion by which legislation can be 
respected and adopted by the citizens of South and North Korea 
alike. 
  He noted that there will be a wide range of problems 
resulting from the reunification of the divided country and due 
process needs to be initiated in advance to deal with them 
effectively. 
  Not only are the existing laws of South and North Korea 
widely different as far as they are known, guidelines to cover 
special problems relating to reunification, such as disputes 
over properties, should be constructed in advance although it 
remains to be seen when they will be applicable. 
  He also said his ministry is looking into the need and 
possibility of setting up border control offices to monitor the 
movement of residents from either side after the national 
division comes to a close. 
  Along these lines, Kim told the Chief Executive, the Justice 
Ministry will study the German unification as a model to adopt 
aspects which are seen as applicable and beneficial. 
  On the crime side, the minister explained that the existing 
16 task forces at prosecutor's offices on environmental and 
health violations will be reinforced throughout the country. 
  Kim said the ministry has already fortified a 24-hour 
investigative system to deal with four of the most violent 
crimes including organized crime, narcotics and human 
trafficking. 
  As far as international issues are concerned, he emphasized 
the need for stationing judicial cooperation attaches in 
organizations like the United Nations and countries like 
Switzerland and China in addition to those now existing in the 
United States and Japan. 
  He said close cooperation will be maintained with government 
officials stationed at missions in foreign countries to collect 
the latest judicial information, evaluate it and make it 
available to domestic organizations. 
  "With the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, it is critical 
that prosecutors and lawyers specializing in international law 
be fully utilized to exercise global influence," Kim elaborated. 
  Meanwhile, the Justice Ministry has begun to realign 
investigations on environmental crimes such as the recent 
contamination of the Naktong River with harmful chemicals and 
human and livestock wastes. 
  Minister Kim said environmental issues are critical to the 
quality of life and that investigations and punitive actions 
will be initiated from the viewpoint of protecting the health 
and rights of the public.

  [Text] Hong Kong, Jan. 26 (YONHAP) -- Pyongyang and Beijing 
have agreed to jointly develop Chongjin port in northwestern 
North Korea, and build a road and at least two hotels in the 
city, the DAGONG BAO newspaper reported Wednesday. 
  The pro-Beijing daily, in a report from Changchun City in 
Jilin Province, called the agreement a measure to accelerate the 
birth of a northeast Asian economic triangle centered on the 
Tuman River. 
  The triangle runs from Chongjin port in North Korea to Yanji 
City in China and Vladivostok in Russia -- all near the Tuman 
River. 
  The United Nations Development Program (UNDP), South and 
North Korea, China, Russia and Japan are trying to develop the 
Tuman River basin as a special economic zone. 
  The state-run Yanji Trading Co. of China has, in a series of 
contacts with North Korea, agreed to invest 370 million yuan (37 
million U.S. dollars) in joint development of Chongjin. 
  When the project is completed, South Korean, Taiwanese, 
U.S., 
Japanese and Hong Kong ships will be allowed to call at the 
port, the paper said. 
  It did not reveal the amount of investment by North Korea. 
  Under the agreement, Yanji will jointly develop the port 
with 
North Korea, build a 95km-long road between Chongjin and 
Hoeryong and erect a hotel with a floor space of 30,000 square 
meters. 
  The paper said that the joint development will greatly 
increase the berth and cargo handling capacity of Chongjin port 
and promote economic cooperation and trade between northeast 
Asian countries.

  [Text] The government is considering lifting all 
restrictions on travel to China as early as next month, informed 
sources said yesterday. 
  Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong is to preside over a 
meeting of working-level officials from the Foreign, Home, 
Justice, Transportation, Trade, Industry and Energy, and Finance 
ministries and the Agency for National Security Planning next 
week to decide on the liberalization, the sources said. An 
inter-ministry meeting in November last year agreed on the need 
to liberalize travel to China during 1994, they said. 
  "There is no particular objection from the concerned 
ministries so the decision will probably be made at next week's 
meeting," an official said. 
  Under a prime ministerial decree, the basic guidelines for 
cooperation and exchange with the so-called "northern" 
countries, government permission is currently required to visit 
China. 
  If a decision is made to liberalize travel to China, the 
basic guidelines will be amended so that Cuba, Laos and Cambodia 
will remain classified as "specific countries." Government 
permission for travel to those countries is given only on the 
basis of invitations from the countries.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 26 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's exports to 
Japan rose a disappointing 1 percent in 1993 amid signs of its 
market share declining, the Korea Foreign Trade Association 
(KFTA) said Wednesday. Korea had exports of 11.69 billion U.S. 
dollars and the lowest growth rate of the nine east Asian 
countries except for Hong Kong, which registered a 2.8-percent 
fall. Korean market share declined 0.1 percentage points to 4.9 
percent. It was 4.2 percent in 1986 and since then had stayed 
above 5 percent. 
  China's exports rose 21.3 percent, the highest rate of the 
nine countries, because of price competitiveness and increasing 
foreign investment. Beijing's share jumped from 7.3 percent to 
8.5 percent. 
  Singapore had 16.3 percent growth on the strength of 
electronic parts and Malaysia was at its elbow with 16.2 percent 
as Japanese companies are expanding their investments.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 27 (YONHAP) -- The Foreign Ministry will 
sell some ambassadorial residences to quieten criticism that 
diplomats are living in luxury, starting in the European Union 
and in Saudi Arabia, officials said Thursday. 
  The ambassador's residence in Bonn, purchased in October 
1984 
for 2.4 million U.S. dollars, sprawls over 5,500 pyong. The 
house will be put out on the market in the first half of the 
year at an asking price of 3 million dollars. 
  Other residences in the European Union and Saudi Arabia will 
be sold after the real estate market picks up, officials said. 
  The ambassador's residence in Brussels, a 400-pyong building 
standing on 15,000 pyong of land, was bought for 3.7 million 
dollars in May 1989 but the current market price is 2.5 million 
dollars. 
  The residence in Saudi Arabia stands on 3,100 pyong. It has 
been renovated and has a value estimated at 7.56 million 
dollars, but its sale is complicated by the fact that the house 
is within the diplomatic complex, the officials said. The 
ministry had ambitiously sought to increase its overseas assets, 
reasoning that owning the residences of mission chiefs would 
save money in the long run. 
  "We received much criticism during a National Assembly 
hearing last year that made us reconsider this plan," an 
official said. 
  Renovation of the official residence for the ambassador to 
the United Nations, recently purchased for 10.83 million 
dollars, was budgeted at 5 million dollars but will be cut by 
more than 1 million dollars.

  [Text] Trading firms can now save their employees ritual 
trips to banks with yesterday's opening of the data system 
allowing foreign exchange paperwork to zip through. The new 
Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) system hooks 33,000 of Korea's 
overseas trading firms to 33 banks for electronic issuance of 
export-import approval, opening of letters of credit and other 
trade-related banking transactions. 
  Kim Myong-ho, governor of the Bank of Korea, demonstrated 
the 
system in yesterday's opening ceremony at the main branch of 
Hanil Bank in Myongdong in downtown Seoul. 
  The system presents standardized forms on the screen for 
users to fill out. The governor processed one firm's request 
for export approval in less than five minutes as a demonstration 
of the system's efficiency. 
  Data indicate that banks processed some 1.3 million similar 
requests last year alone. The difference was that those 
transactions took place at the expense of actual visits to banks 
through traffic and waits upon arrival. 
  Officials at the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy say 
that plans are now underway to expand the system to include 
shipping and customs by July and October of this year, 
respectively. By 1996, they are envisioning a comprehensive 
electronic network covering the A to Z of overseas trading. The 
current system is limited to 33 Korean banks handling foreign 
exchanges. But officials say foreign banks operating in Korea 
are likely to be added to the system by July.

<F P=106> [Article by So Myong-suk] </F>
  [Text] President Kim Yong-sam has faced most difficult 
time since he took the office. Skepticism and criticism for the 
directions and the methods of the reforms are slowly coming out. 
"Does President Kim's government has any solid 
`core-reform-power team' to carry out the reform?" seemed to be 
the most concerned and realistic questions over Kim and his 
government. In political language, the `core-reform-power' 
means President Kim's power-base. 
  President Kim started his presidency with a strong command 
of 
leadership, but series of situations which occured recently has 
caused reason enough to raise questions. Representive You 
Song-hwan, who belongs to the Democratic faction [President 
Kim's faction of the Democratic Liberal Party], raised a 
question about past political involvement of Representive Kim 
Yun-hwan, who is from the Democratic Justice [DJ] faction of the 
same party and it triggered the burst of the factional feuds. 
And, it led the DJ faction to casts the "angry votes" during a 
bill passing process on the 25th [October]--recommanding the 
release of National Assembly members, Pak Chol-on and Kim 
Chong-in was the bill they were trying to pass. In addition, 
the cabinet is unable to break through the thick wall of the 
bureaucrats and is vacillating. 
  The opposition party has started to irritate President Kim 
and his administration not to miss this opportunity. On 28 
October, the first day of the National Assembly Hearing against 
the government on the political affairs, the members of the 
opposition party concentrated on attacking the ruling party's 
internal feud. Representive Yim Chae-chong, Democratic Party 
[DP], accused the Kim's Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] for 
taking an ambiguous position and ridiculed that the DLP is not a 
`core-reform-power' of Kim that can lead the reforms, but a 
political body which has interest only in pursuing its own 
faction's gains, thus it should be a reform target. Yim's 
criticism continued and he accued President Kim for keeping 
unstable coalition with the old establishment ever since the 
three parties merged. Yim asked "what happened to his [Kim] 
going into the tiger's den to catch a tiger?" 
  Representive Chang Ki-uk, who also participiated in the 
attack, made a statement that the bold punishment should be 
carried out for the DLP, a political party born of the 12 
December and the 17 May Coups, members who were connected with 
the anti-people and anti-democracy actions, and charged for 
corruptions. 
  Why is the opposition party demanding the ruling party to 
reorganize the `coer-reform-power,' and making it a political 
issue? It is obvious that the DP wants to reveal the political 
limitation of the DLP by irritaing the weakness of President 
Kim's `three in one' party. 
  But, it is difficult to treat the opposition's attacks 
merely 
as a politcal game play because these points are shared by the 
most of the public. Although the DLP's DJ faction and the 
Democratic faction do not and will not acknowledge the feud 
among factions and the hetrogeneity in public. But, the 
heterogenity and the factional feud of the DLP does exist and 
it's a real thing, and no one will deny the facts in private. 
After all, each faction's have their own root, different 
experiences of history, different evaluations and understandings 
of the past governments. And the difference of the two 
factions' appriciation and motive for creating the Kim Yong-sam 
government is wide apart. 
  The DJ faction's reaction to Representive Yu's "past 
political involvement" issue clearly showed the fundamwntal 
difference of the two factions. During the National Assembly's 
audit and inspection of the government, Representive Yu made a 
suggestion, "how about the traing institute of government 
employees invite the persons like Chon Tu-hwan, No Tae-u, Choe 
Hyong-u, Pak Sok-mu, Yi Chol and Kim Yu-hwan as the guest 
lecturers, who can lecture them contemporary Korean histories 
from thier vivid experiences and give them the benefit of real 
history lessons, rather than inviting those scholars who have 
been educated abroad?" Yu's that suggestion created a big 
ripple. 
  In other words, Yu is saying that Representive Choe Hyong-u 
can cover the lecture on the dictatorial military governments 
and the toture and Representive Kim Yun-hwan could speak on the 
Yusin government since he has been a member of the Yujonghoe. 
And the DJ faction's response to that was "how quickly they 
forget, it hasn't been that long ago they asked for our help to 
get Kim yong-sam elected. But now, they want to hurt us." The 
Dmocratic faction's reponse to that is "it's only an 
individual's private opinion, besides,it's certainly a 
discussible subjectd." A telephone interview on 26 [October] 
just before he left the country, Representive Yu responded with 
"I have mentioned lot more names than what the media printed and 
that caused the misunderstandings. In fact, in my opinion, the 
Yusin cannot be 100 percent bad and the regrets and repenting of 
the past could be a good lessons for the history." 
  At a TV talk show on 23 October, Representive Choe spoke 
about the "qualification need to become DLP's executive 
chairman," which also caused a stir. Choe explained that "I was 
not prepared to give an answer when I was unexpectedly asked 
about it, so I gave a very basic answer that it must be a person 
who can be able to lead the reform." But for the DJ and NDR 
[New Democratic Reperblican] factions have taken it as the 
Democratic factions act to shake up the Ececutive Chairman Kim 
Chong-pil's position prior to the May DLP convention. 
  Despite their long co-existance as a part of same political 
party, the DLP's factional power struggle has hurt the party and 
its unity and harmony. However, on 27 [October], President Kim 
invited the DLP key leaders and the members of the special 
committee for political affairs to Blue House for dinner and 
that seemed to bring a temporary peace, at least an appearance 
wise. But, the deep seeded feud will not go away easily--the 
Blue House is pushing to pass a bill, the Reform Law--the 
revised law related to political affairs--during the regular 
National Assembly seesion, but the DLP majority, the DJ faction, 
considers that as an action to destroy them. Another example 
for the discord is that recently Executive Chairman Kim 
Chong-pil excluded the chairman of the Planning and Managing 
Committee, Paek Nam-chi of the Democratic faction, from the DLP 
high level members meeting. 
  Nevertheless, there is a view agreed by the majority that 
President Kim will not purposely carry out an action to 
dismentle the DLP, or the DJ faction to leave the DLP to have 
its own party before the 15th General Election. The majority 
believes that President Kim, who knows the nature of the DJ 
faction better than anyone, will embrace those DJ faction 
members, who share his political reform direction, and lead the 
party effectively until the election in 1996. 
  President Kim's more pressing problem is on the fact that 
his 
administration has not been able to break through the thick 
walls of the bureaucrats, who are the front line workers of the 
government administration. Although the cabinet, which consist 
of a few from the DJ faction, who were part of the Fifth and 
Sixth Republics and who knows Kim personally, and some of the 
Democratic faction members appears to have a united front, they 
have no clear picture nor understandings of the reform and its 
directions. So, the cabinet merely maintains the vertical 
relationship with the president. 
  Thus, the prevailing atmosphere among the bureaucrats are 
"self protectionism and the peace-at-any price-ism," do best to 
escape from the corruption probes, and the attitute of "wait and 
see" towards the new government. In fact, they have a new term 
saying, "the bureaucrats are here and will be here but the 
government power can go anytime." The passive ruling party, 
do-nothing bureaucrats, the directionless cabinet, etc. show how 
weak the President Kim's power base is. 
  Can President Kim over come these obscles and build a firm 
foundation for his leadership? There are pleanty of rumors 
addressing to that subject, such as, the cabinet reshuffle 
before the year's end and the party leadership changes at the 
May convention, etc. Also, Presidential pardon of former law 
maker, So Sok-chae, before the year's end and appoint him to a 
cabinet post, name the DJ faction's Kim Yun-hwan and Yi Han-tong 
to cabinet, and who will be replaced, etc. are a part of the 
rumors. 
  However, these are merely a part of a transitional measure. 
A long range out look for building a firm foundation for his 
leadership is likely to be in the plan. In that respect, paying 
a special attention to the upcoming 1995 elections for the local 
government legislatures and governers is necessary. Recently, 
while working on a proposal for the unified, overall election 
law, the DLP's Special Committee for Political Affairs confirmed 
its proposition on the 1995 election schedule for the local 
government system (the elections for legislature members, heads 
of cities, counties, districts in February; city counsils and 
representives for the provinces aand governers in May,etc.) All 
four elections are pushed into 1995, and it also included 
applying the party nomination system for the basic legislature 
[kicho uihoe] candidates. 
  If this unifed election law passes, in 1995, President Kim 
will have the nomination rights to all candidates--for mayors, 
county and district heads and provincial governers. What an 
opportunity for Kim Yong-sam to have his people at the every 
coners of the country! Series of recent appointments of the PK 
[Pusan/Kyongnam] persons to various government posts, government 
owned companies, banking industries, etc. are good indications 
for the direction of nomination process for the local government 
election candidates. It seems that the ruling party has 
conducted a survey on the current and propective mayors and 
provincial governers already. A rumor about Secrtary General of 
the Blue House, Pak Kwan-yong, is interested in running for the 
Pusan mayor's seat is another indication how much the weight the 
ruling party is putting onto the local election. 
  The Blue House is pushing hard for the unified election law 
to pass before the year's end. The Blue House's reason for 
pushing it is that since the public demand for the political 
reforms is very high, government needs not to loose the 
oppotunity to fullfill the public desire. Also, it is necessary 
for government to have a time to prepare for a clean election 
for the local election, which takes place before the general 
election. 
  If President Kim's priority is on the local election, where 
he can establish a concrete power base, rather than the the 
General Election in 1996, passing the unified election law in 
1993 is must. In that respect, a remark by a Blue House high 
official is a meaningful one, he said "there are lots of rumors 
spreading about the cabinet reshuffle and other affairs to take 
a place before the year's end, but they are all speculations. 
The real issue that needs to be done within this year is 
paasing this Political Reform Law. It will be the beginning of 
every debate and will be a starting point of everything. The 
driving force of political power and the directions will appear 
after the bill.

  [Text] Sunkyong Business Group has emerged as a controlling 
shareholder of Korea Mobile Telecom (KMT) in fact by acquiring 
the biggest equity stake in the nation's cellular-phone 
monopoly. Three Sunkyong subsidiaries succeeded in buying a 
total of 1.27 million KMT shares through competitive bidding 
yesterday, securing the conglomerate a controlling 23-percent 
stake in the cellular monopoly. State-funded Korea Telecom said 
292 investors had competed for 2.44 million of its KMT shares 
put up for sale Monday and Tuesday but no other bidders were 
successful. 
  Korea Telecom said it will invite new tenders for the 
remaining 1.17 million shares. After the sale, Korea Telecom, 
left with a 20- percent stake in KMT, will hand over management 
control to Sunkyong. 
  Sunkyong offered 427.1 billion won, paying an average 
321,000 
won per share, a Korea Telecom spokesman said. 
  Although long anticipated, the result of yesterday's bidding 
gives Sunkyong, already the nation's fifth largest conglomerate, 
a vital niche in the nation's potentially lucrative cellular 
industry. 
  The nation's cellular-phone industry has been growing 80 to 
100 percent a year and reached over 470,000 subscribers at the 
end of last year. Since it was established in March 1984, KMT 
has grown into a 498.3 billion-won cellular monopoly employing 
2,000 people. The company generated 420 billion won in sales 
last year. Its net profit that year was 71.9 billion won. 
  Given the business opportunities involved, it has long been 
said that the successful bidder for KMT will likely emerge as a 
major business empire. 
  KMT is currently the nation's only cellular operator. A 
second cellular network is to be formed later this year. The 
Communications Ministry has timed the sale of KMT shares so as 
to cool a fevered tug-of-war among major business conglomerates 
currently bidding for the second network. 
  In December, the government gave the Federation of Korean 
Industries, the nation's largest business organization, the task 
of forming a single consortium to build and operate the new 
cellular network. The federation's decision is due Feb. 28. 
  Yesterday's auction was a sweet victory for Sunkyong. 
Although it won a cellular license in 1992, Sunkyong had to 
relinquish its successful bid in the face of embarrassing 
charges of nepotism. The son of Sunkyong chairman Choe 
Chong-hyon is married to a daughter of then President No Tae-u.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 27 (KCNA) -- A bill on the start 
of Radio "Free Asia" broadcasting was carried at the U.S. Senate 
on Jan. 25, an NHK news report said. 
  It goes without saying that the Korean peninsula is the main 
target of the reactionary Radio "Free Asia," which will 
broadcast "news and commentaries helpful to the national 
interests of the United States." 
  This is another move of the anti-socialist, anti-DPRK 
campaign of the United States. It shows they are executing in 
real earnest their "peaceful transition" strategy to disunite 
the DPRK ideologically from within. 
  This is an intolerable challenge to the DPRK. 
  It is self-evident that the U.S. scheme to start "Free Asia" 
broadcasting is aimed at sending the wind of "liberalization" 
into our country and thus instilling bourgeois ideology into the 
minds of the Korean people and undermining the Korean-style 
socialist system centred on the popular masses. 
  The U.S. attempt to undermine the DPRK ideologically and 
culturally by false propaganda through "Free Asia" is as stupid 
as trying to move a rock with a mouthful of blowing. 
  The Korean people firmly equipped with the chuche idea will 
never lend an ear to the bourgeois propaganda that does not 
appeal to their sentiments. 
  The United States must clearly know the ideological will of 
the Korean people and stop the futile attempt to start the 
broadcasting of "Free Asia."

Chairman of the C.C., the Korean Catholics Association Chang 
Chae-chol, and other religionists. 
  Rev. Billy Graham published a statement on his arrival at 
the 
airport. 
  Recalling his first visit to the DPRK in April 1992, he 
related the goals of his visit this time. 
  He said: 
  "First, I want to renew my friendship with the many people I 
met during my previous trip, and to make new friends as well. 
  "Friendship is one of the most precious things in this 
world. 
I have learned that friendship is more important than wealth, 
or fame, or power. 
  "The second reason I wanted to return to the DPRK is to have 
fellowship with my fellow Christian believers here, and to 
witness the progress of your churches. 
  "Christians often serve as a bridge between different 
societies. That bridge brought me here two years ago, and I 
believe as a result of that visit the bridge between us is 
stronger now than it was then. 
  "During my time here I especially am looking forward to 
visiting three commemorative sites. The first is the historic 
birthplace of President Kim Il-song just outside Pyongyang. In 
addition I am pleased to be able to view the museum at Kim 
Il-song University honoring secretary Kim Chong-il. It also 
will be a privilege to visit the site at Chilgol where President 
Kim Il-song's mother was born. 
  "The third reason I have wanted to come here at this time is 
to express my unswerving commitment to peace and good will 
between our two nations. I am aware that I come at a 
particularly complex time in our relationships, and perhaps in 
some small way this visit will contribute to a new atmosphere of 
mutual respect and good will and understanding."

<F P=106> ["Tragic End of Traitor Group Inevitable" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 27 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
declares that the Kim Yong-sam traitor group of South Korea is 
doomed to a tragic end. 
  Kim Yong-sam the traitor has made himself the enemy not only 
of the South Korean people but also of the whole nation by 
seeking dependence on outside forces and North-South 
confrontation and bartering away the dignity and interests of 
the nation to outside forces to gratify his greed for power, 
notes the paper in an article. 
  The author of the article says: 
  He earned himself the hatred and grievances of the South 
Korean people by establishing "civilian" fascist dictatorship 
which is little different from the preceding military 
dictatorship. While waxing eloquent about "civilian politics," 
he extended in actuality the military fascist dictatorship of 
the "Fifth Republic" and the "Sixth Republic" without 
modification. 
  It is clear to everyone that the reactionary rulers who 
suppress the people and encroach upon their interests are 
rejected by the popular masses. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique 
landed itself in a hopeless isolation by committing treacheries 
against fellow countrymen. 
  The traitor has trampled upon the agreement with 
nonaggression as its core and the joint declaration on 
denuclearisation by seizing power after the adoption and 
effectuation of these historic documents between North and 
South. And he has broken up the North-South dialogues, which 
had continued even in the days of the regime of military 
dictatorship, raising a hue and cry over "suspected nuclear 
development" by the North. And he resumed the "Team Spirit" 
joint military drill which had been suspended toward the end of 
the "Sixth Republic" and staged a chain of North-targeted 
nuclear war exercises codenamed "Ulchi," "Ulchi Focus Lens," 
"Foal Eagle-93," "Hwarang," etc., thus aggravating the 
North-South relations and leading the situation to the brink of 
war. 
  Out in front in the nuclear clamor raised by the imperialist 
reactionaries to stifle the DPRK, the traitor Kim Yong-sam 
sought "an international cooperation system" and displayed 
feverish activities to have "sanctions" taken against it. 
  When countries and nations were advancing toward 
independence 
in the international arena, he entreated the United States to 
shelve its "troops cutback program" by offering a burden share 
to the tune of more than 3,000 million dollars for their 
maintenance and "protect" South Korea with the "nuclear 
umbrella" and, in the relations with Japan, he absolved the 
Japanese imperialists of their crimes in aggression on Korea and 
sought tieup with the Japanese reactionaries, thus standing 
naked as a pro-Japanese lackey. 
  In a little more than ten months of his office, Kim Yong-sam 
stripped himself bare to reveal his ugly color as "a civilian 
puppet," "a civilian fascist," "a civilian separatist," "a 
civilian warmaniac" and "a civilian traitor." 
  He is doomed to be thrown into a dustbin of history like his 
predecessors.

<F P=106> ["Confrontation Row Heralds Ruin" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 27 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
condemns the South Korean puppets for kicking up a row of 
confrontation, declaring that their orientation this year is to 
"establish a posture of prompt reaction to regular warfare" and 
"stage exercises simulating actual war to provide against 
regular warfare". 
  Branding this row of the South Korean puppets as an act 
going 
against the desire of the nation for reunification, the news 
analyst says: 
  The puppets are carping on the North, crying over its 
"commandos" and "provocation". But it is an old tune which 
everyone is weary of hearing and a foolish phrase that can 
convince no one. 
  "Emergency preparedness" on the lips of the Kim Yong-sam 
puppet clique means to make a war against the North a fait 
accompli on the Korean peninsula according to the outside 
forces' policy of aggression and to be prepared for mobilizing 
all the human and material resources of South Korea. 
  The Kim Yong-sam clique ceaselessly staged military 
exercises 
in league with foreign forces of aggression last year and 
mobilized even para-military forces in them beside the puppet 
Army. 
  The puppets' outcries for "completion of allout combat 
posture of civilians, government and Army" and "exercises 
simulating actual war to provide against regular warfare" 
suggest that they would be more frenzied in war rackets against 
fellow countrymen by mobilizing even citizens this year. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is trying to divert elsewhere 
the attention of people with the row of confrontation against 
the North and thus tide over the crisis of the fascist rule. 
  The foul attempt of the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, however, 
stands no chance of success. 
  Its confrontation row against the DPRK will invite fiercer 
resentment of the people and precipitate its own destruction.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "Civilian Regime Which </F>
Repeats an Old Tune"] 
  [Text] According to radio reports from Seoul, on 21 
January, the puppet Kim Yong-sam clique convened a meeting 
called the 27th central anti-espionage operations meeting and 
decided that the goal of the so-called anti-espionage operations 
this year is to establish a total national security posture. 
  At the meeting attended by the rabble in charge of national 
security, the bastards recklessly found fault with us and 
babbled that they must increase the preparedness for immediate 
reaction to unconventional warfare, strengthen the total defense 
system involving the people, the government, and the military, 
and conduct exercises in a real combat situation for 
unconventional warfare to counter a so-called provocation. 
  This is the repetition of the old tune of the preceding 
dictators and an intolerable challenge to us, who are 
persistently making efforts for peace in the country and its 
reunification. 
  As everyone knows, traitors Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, the 
previous dictators, talked about the so-called anti-espionage 
operations or someone else's provocations and loudly talked as 
if we would launch a southward invasion at once. The people of 
the world acknowledge that we have never launched a southward 
invasion and that threats of aggression come from the South to 
the North, not from the North to the South. 
  The Kim Yong-sam regime, which calls itself a civilian 
government, repeats the old tune which has already been sung. 
This means the Kim Yong-sam regime is no different from the 
preceding military fascist dictatorships. Learning from the 
preceding dictators, it does so to justify its maneuvers to 
prepare for a war of northward invasion under the pretext of 
someone else's nonexistent provocation. 
  All fellow countrymen in the North and South and abroad are 
filled with a resolve to make this year a year when they will 
achieve great national unity and open a new phase in the 
fatherland's reunification. They also expect that in step with 
the fellow countrymen's heightened ardor for reunification, 
North-South relations will be led to detente and peace. 
Meanwhile, through several rounds of contacts, the DPRK and the 
United States have removed a series of obstacles that had 
deadlocked DPRK-U.S. talks and achieved a breakthrough to make 
progress in the talks. 
  When bright prospects have opened for peace in the country 
and its reunification, the Kim Yong-sam ring is using the old 
tune, which the preceding dictators chanted over and over again, 
as a means to aggravate North-South tensions and embarking on a 
road toward confrontation. 
  From the very beginning of new year, the South Korean 
warmongers found fault with us and recklessly made bellicose 
remarks about immediate punishment or complete military 
preparedness. This is no accident. The Kim Yong-sam ring 
decided that strengthening the total defense system involving 
the people, the government, and the military and conducting 
exercises in a real combat situation for unconventional warfare 
will be the goal of the so-called anti- espionage operations 
this year. This means that it will conduct larger-scale war 
exercises this year. 
  A few while ago, the South Korean puppets babbled that they 
would conduct a large-scale joint military exercise, a 
combination of the Ulchi and Focus Lens military exercises, with 
the United States in August in case they discontinue the Team 
Spirit joint military exercise. Facts show the Kim Yong-sam 
regime is a group of warmongers and an antinational group that 
follows the preceding military fascist groups' footsteps. 
  The South Korean puppets are rushing toward confrontation 
and 
war, not national reconciliation and unity, this year. The 
reason is clear. The bastards are facing a serious crisis in 
their rule. The Kim Yong-sam ring has loudly babbled about 
reforms, talking as if they would do something. However, 
nothing has changed in South Korea. Rather, fascist suppression 
has been stepped up, a worse economic catastrophe and greater 
difficulties have been inflicted on the people. Not only the 
people's struggle for independence, democracy, and reunification 
but also the workers' strikes have been suppressed brutally, and 
as a result of the treacherous opening of the rice market, 6 
million peasants, agriculture, and the overall economy are 
threatened with a catastrophe. Moreover, the Naktong and Han 
Rivers and other rivers have been contaminated, and, therefore, 
numerous people face difficulties in getting potable water. 
Therefore, the South Korean people call the Kim Yong-sam regime 
a civilian fascist or non-civilian regime and participate in the 
antigovernment struggle to overthrow the bastards. 
  Flustered at this, the Kim Yong-sam ring is trying to divert 
the people's attention somewhere else by talking as if we would 
launch a southward aggression at once, thus, inspiring a sense 
of urgency. However, this is a foolish dream. No one will be 
deceived by the theory of threats of southward invasion, which 
has already been done before. 
  The Kim Yong-sam ring's reckless war maneuvers will further 
inspire the South Korean people's resistance. The Kim Yong-sam 
ring must ponder over grave consequences from its reckless war 
maneuvers, act with discretion, and leave office without delay.

<F P=106> [Commentary by station commentator Yun Pyong-son: "The </F>
Traitorous Regime Cannot Last Long"] 
  [Text] According to a radio report from Seoul, the Kim 
Yong-sam puppet clique established a new traffic tax under the 
pretext of resolving the traffic issue early this year. Now it 
is once again trying to establish a new agriculture-fishery 
special tax as well as an environment tax. 
  The puppets are raving that new taxes are necessary in order 
to generate the financial resources needed to change the 
structure of agriculture-fishery villages in the wake of market 
opening and in a bid to resolve the issue of polluted tap water 
from polluted rivers. However, this is nothing but sophistry to 
justify maneuvers to create new taxes to exploit the people. 
  As is widely known, broad segments of the South Korean 
populace, including farmers, strongly objected to the rice 
market opening, branding the puppets' maneuvers for rice market 
opening as the act of driving farmers to their death and making 
the South Korean people slaves to foreign provisions. However, 
the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, ignoring their promises and the 
people's resistance, did not hesitate in opening up the South's 
rice markets in order to ingratiate itself with the U.S. masters. 
  In addition, the South Korean people have long urged the 
puppet authorities to come up with a policy to prevent river 
pollution. The rascals received considerable amounts of money 
from intermediary waste disposal companies to overlook the 
discharge of poisonous industrial wastes into the Naktong River, 
and allowed these companies to build waste disposal plants in 
areas designated as tap water protection sites. As a result, 
ten million residents in the Naktong River area alone are 
suffering from a lack of tap water, which is of utmost 
importance to daily living. 
  South Korea has become the worst traffic hell in the world, 
many residents are suffering from the polluted tap water from 
the seriously polluted environment, and agricultural and fishery 
villages are doomed to ruin because of market opening. This is 
entirely attributed to the policy of Kim Yong-sam's flunkeyist, 
traitorous regime against the nation. Therefore, the Kim 
Yong-sam puppet regime should totally assume responsibility for 
this. 
  Nonetheless, the Kim Yong-sam ring's new taxes and their 
attempt to strengthen exploitation of the people is like the 
saying of the guilty person venting his anger upon others for no 
reason. 
  A South Korean radio reported that if the special tax for 
rural and fishing villages and the environment are added to the 
existing education tax and traffic tax, the people will be 
forced to pay an additional four different taxes this year. The 
radio denounced the authorities' maneuvers to establish new 
taxes, saying that if taxes are created every time issues like 
this come up, no matter how many purposeful taxes are created, 
it will never be enough. 
  The South Korean people have been burdened with various 
kinds 
of heavy taxes. According to the materials released by the 
puppet Finance Ministry, taxes that will be imposed upon the 
South Korean rural and fishery households this year will amount 
to an average of almost 1,350,000 won. Like the gangster-like 
theory that taxes can be squeezed out of people once levied, the 
puppet clique has constantly created new taxes and tried to 
exploit the South Korean people by squeezing every last drop of 
their blood. 
  The puppets' babble about generating so-called financial 
resources is a brazen-faced maneuver. To maintain their own 
conveniences and power, the traitorous groups opened the rice 
markets on which the lives of hundreds of farmers depend, and 
have polluted the tap water of the 10 million residents. What 
on earth can they do for the people? 
  While paying lip service to conducting politics centered on 
the people's livelihood, the Kim Yong-sam ring babbles as though 
it is doing something for the people. In actuality, it only 
thinks of exploiting the people. The Kim Yong-sam puppet's 
regime is an exploitatious, blood-sucking regime which exceeds 
preceding rulers. 
  The rascals can never cover up their traitorous color of 
afflicting misfortunes and sufferings upon the people. As long 
as the Kim Yong-sam ring, which answers people's complaints over 
the rice market opening and the river pollution with strong 
exploitation to maintain power, the South Korean people cannot 
free themselves from the present status or poverty 
  The South Korean people will never forgive the Kim Yong-sam 
traitorous regime's crimes and will deal a hard blow to the 
rascals.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 27 (KCNA) -- The North side 
headquarters of the National Alliance of Youth and Students for 
the Country's Reunification (Pomchonghaknyon) issued a statement 
Wednesday denouncing the South Korean authorities for blocking 
the Seoul trip of the mourners' group of the North side for the 
funeral of Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, a patriotic champion of 
reunification. 
  The statement scathingly denounces the traitor Kim 
Yong-sam's 
fascist step as an intolerable insult to the patriotic spirit of 
Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, a grave infringement on the compatriotic 
feelings of the entire youth and students and people in the 
North and a total denial of ethics and morality. 
  The statement says: 
  "It is outrageous of the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique to talk 
about `organisation benefiting the enemy' and `nuclear issue' 
for justifying their act this time. 
  "Denying the National Alliance for the Country's 
Reunification (Pomminnyon) means denying great unity of the 
nation, and the latter means denying national reunification. 
  "The entire youth and students in the northern half of the 
country will become flames burning injustice and immorality and 
standard-bearers of great national unity, punish the Kim 
Yong-sam puppet clique seeking a way out in dependence on 
outside forces and North-South confrontation and achieve 
national reunification which was the lifelong wish of Rev. Mun 
Ik-hwan, a patriotic martyr for reunification, rallied around 
Pomchonghaknyon, the vanguard of Pomminnyon."

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 27 (KCNA) -- The great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year address was carried by the Indian 
papers WORUM and INDEPENDENT, the Indian magazine SOCIALOOK and 
the Mozambican magazine TEMPO. 
  Seminars on the New Year address were held in Harare 
Province, Zimbabwe, and at the group for the study of the chuche 
idea of President Kim Il-song in Vienna, Austria, and a branch 
of the Malian Youth Revolutionary Front of Self-Reliance. 
  The reporters and speakers at the seminars said the Korean 
people last year made great achievements in socialist 
construction despite the unprecedentedly vicious machinations of 
the imperialists and fully demonstrated the superiority of 
Korean-style socialism, the embodiment of the chuche idea. 
  They estimated the confederacy formula of reunification put 
forward by President Kim Il-song as the most fair and aboveboard 
proposal for a peaceful reunification of Korea. 
  They demanded the South Korean authorities renounce the 
policy of depending on outside forces and choose to reunify 
Korea by confederacy formula. 
  The United States must immediately stop the anti-socialist, 
anti-DPRK campaign and fairly settle the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula through DPRK-U.S. talks, they urged. 
  A meeting explaining the New Year address was held in West 
Mashonaland Province, Zimbabwe, and its reading session at the 
Guyana torchlight Taekwon-to group for the study of the chuche 
idea of Comrade Kim Il-song.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] Paek In-chun, chairman of the North side 
headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's 
Reunification [Pomminnyon] issued a press statement on 24 
January on the 3d anniversary of the formation of the North side 
headquarters of Pomminnyon. 
  The press statement reads: The twenty-fifth of January marks 
the 3d anniversary of the formation of the North side 
headquarters of Pomminnyon. We who are involved in the work of 
Pomminnyon are filled anew with deep emotion and great resolve 
as we greet this day at this magnificent juncture when all the 
fellow countrymen at home and abroad have designated this year a 
year of great national unity for the country's reunification and 
undertaken the first step for pannational reunification. 
  Three years have passed since the North side headquarters 
were designated as a regional organization of Pomminnyon during 
the formation of the Pomminnyon at the three-way working talks 
held in Berlin in November 1990 following the resolution of the 
first round of pannational rally on 15 August that year. Since 
its formation, the North side headquarters of Pomminnyon has 
waged a vigorous struggle to realize the country's reunification 
to fulfill its lofty mission and responsibility to history and 
the nation, strengthening its relations with the other 
Pomminnyon organizations at home and abroad. 
  All the struggles the Pomminnyon has waged for these three 
years--such as the struggle to promote the implementation of the 
historic North-South Agreement and the joint declaration on 
denuclearization, the many rounds of pannational rallies which 
were grandly held to crush the splittist forces' persistent 
suppressive and obstructive maneuvers, the meetings of the 
Pomminnyon chairmen's groups, and the struggle for the abolition 
of the evil anti- reunification laws, for the release of 
patriotic figures devoted to reunification, and for the 
repatriation of old man Yi In-mo--have been just and patriotic 
struggles which reflect the aspiration of all the fellow 
countrymen who ardently desire national unity and the country's 
reunification. 
  Through the numerous joint struggles since their formation, 
our Pomminnyon organizations have been able to contribute to 
strengthening the independent might of the country's 
reunification and further heightening the fellow countrymen's 
reunification desire at home and abroad. Through the three 
years of the Pomminnyon movement, we have demonstrated at home 
and abroad that our Pomminnyon's advance for the realization of 
the three principles-- independence, peaceful reunification, and 
great national unity, which are the common national ideals--is 
unstoppable, no matter what desperate efforts the splittist 
forces may take from their aversion to national unity and the 
country's independent and peaceful reunification, and that the 
victory of the cause of our reunification is inevitable. 
  The great advance of our nation for the country's 
reunification is now entering a new stage, and the fellow 
countrymen's desire for this has become more ardent with the new 
year. The great leader President Kim Il-song--who provided a 
sagacious analysis of the new situational demands in developing 
the reunification movement and the fellow countrymen's 
aspiration for reunification--elucidated a programmatic task in 
his New Year's address this year for all the compatriots at home 
and abroad to wage a pannational struggle in firm unity under 
the banner of great national unity in order to bring forth a new 
phase for the country's reunification this year. Prior to this, 
last year, he brought forth a 10-point program for the great 
unity of the whole nation for the country's reunification, which 
is a great political charter for national unity. 
  A weighty but honorable task has now been set for the North 
side headquarters of Pomminnyon to wage a more vigorous movement 
for great unity of the whole nation by giving impetus to the 
ardent aspiration and will of all fellow countrymen for national 
unity and reunification, upholding the 10-point program for the 
great unity of the whole nation for the country's reunification. 
Some time ago we designated this year a year of great national 
unity based on the proposal made by the overseas headquarters of 
Pomminnyon, and announced at home and abroad that all the 
activities of Pomminnyon will be concentrated on the realization 
of the great unity of the whole nation. 
  I declare once again the resolve of the North side 
headquarters of Pomminnyon to brilliantly realize, in 
cooperation with all the other Pomminnyon organizations at home 
and abroad, the 10-point program for the great unity of the 
whole nation for the country's reunification and make this year 
a year of great national unity and a year of opening a new phase 
for the country's reunification so that we may realize the 
country's reunification in the 1990's without fail. 
  In the future, we will explain, publicize, and implement 
the 10-point program for the great unity of the whole nation 
taking advantage of all of Pomminnyon's activities so as to 
actively inspire all fellow countrymen to defy all differences 
of political opinion, religion, party faction, and position to 
rise nationwide and unite as one in the movement for the 
country's reunification. 
  Many obstacles and difficulties remain on the road of our 
struggle against national oppression and for reunification. 
Trying to maintain colonial division system infinitely by 
relying on outside forces, the present South Korean rulers began 
aggravating tensions between the North and the South from the 
beginning of the new year by scheming large-scale war exercises, 
including the Team Spirit joint military exercise aiming at the 
North, and by wielding the national security law which defines 
fellow countrymen as the enemy, to intensify suppression of 
South Korean pro-reunification patriotic forces, including 
Pomminnyon-related figures. 
  Furthermore, the South Korean authorities did not hesitate 
to 
commit criminal acts against human ethics a few days ago. 
Citing absurd reasons and pretexts, they blocked the Seoul 
visit of the group of mourners from the North side who had 
wanted to pay their respects to the late Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, whose 
whole life was spent devoted to reunification and patriotism and 
who fought at the fore for the formation of the South side 
headquarters of Pomminnyon. 
  The maneuvers of the Kim Yong-sam group, which schemes 
confrontation and division and goes against the fellow 
countrymen's desire for reunification, are by far more crafty 
and atrocious than those of previous military dictators. 
  Fellow countrymen in South Korea and abroad from all walks 
of 
life are raising their voice of rage and denunciation against 
the South Korean Kim Yong-sam group which wears a so-called 
civilian mask. 
  In the future, we will not tolerate any legal and 
institutional devices as well as antireunification force's 
maneuvers that put a brake on the great national unity. We will 
especially designate forces that attempt to designate 
Pomminnyon, the mother body of great national unity, as being 
heretical, and that attempt to destroy or disintegrate it by 
outlawing its activities, as the enemy of the nation obstructing 
the country's reunification and national unity, and will wage a 
staunch struggle to remove it. 
  We strongly demand that the present South Korean authorities 
who have persistently blocked the formation of the South side 
headquarters of Pomminnyon, to promptly stop their traitorous 
acts and positively ensure Pomminnyon's pro-reunification and 
patriotic activities. 
  As in the past, our North side headquarters will continue in 
the future to actively support and root for the just struggle of 
the South side Pomminnyon-related figures to carry out 
legitimate Pomminnyon activities in South Korea and will 
vigorously and continuously carry out pro-reunification and 
patriotic activities by strengthening solidarity with all 
Pomminnyon organizations at home and abroad. 
  No one can block the Pomminnyon's grand march toward 
reunification which bears the whole nation's aspiration for 
reunification. Marking the fifth year of the nineties, we can 
no longer abide by the tragedy of national division brought 
about by outside forces. 
  I ardently call on the 70 million fellow countrymen in the 
North, South, and overseas, to join Pomminnyon in stepping up 
the grand march toward reunification under the banner of great 
national unity.

<F P=106> [From the "Ray of Chuche" program: "The Invincible Vitality </F>
of the Line for Building a Self-Reliant National Economy"] 
  [Text] Our party has persistently adhered to the line of 
building a self-reliant national economy. Our party's line for 
building a self-reliant national economy is the embodiment of 
chuche ideology in economic construction and is a policy for 
building an economy that is not subjugated to others, but 
marches by itself, serves its people, and develops with its own 
country's resources and the might of the people. 
  It is not easy to implement the line for building a 
self-reliant national economy. Our people had to build the 
economy anew on an empty field where everything was destroyed 
and have firmly adhered to the line for building a self-reliant 
national economy even under the circumstance of carrying on 
socialist construction while constantly facing the imperialists' 
invasion threat. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is wisely leading us 
today to firmly maintain the line for building a self-reliant 
national economy, even while socialist construction is 
progressing at a high level. The dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il has pointed out: Only when we build a self-reliant 
economy that marches by itself based on modern technology, can 
we firmly guarantee an independent and creative working and 
material lifestyle for the people, achieve chuche in ideology, 
independence in politics, self-reliance in defense, and 
strengthen the country's independence. 
  We cannot think of the great results and victory achieved in 
revolution and construction by our people in recent years 
without the dear comrade leader's wise leadership in the 
implementation of the line for building a self-reliant national 
economy. 
  The line for building a self-reliant national economy is 
vigorously displaying its correctness and vitality in our 
country today. The invincible vitality of our party's line for 
building a self-reliant national economy is represented, above 
all, by the fact that the country's political independence is 
firmly defended. 
  Political independence is the very life of a sovereign and 
independent country. Such important political independence is 
guaranteed by a self-reliant national economy. A self-reliant 
economy is a material guarantee for achieving political 
independence. 
  The serious situation in which socialism was recently 
frustrated in many countries shows that political independence 
cannot be achieved without a self-reliant economy. These 
countries were economically bound to big countries because they 
failed to build a self-reliant economy earlier, and as a result, 
they could not establish self-reliance in every aspect, but kept 
following others' modifications, thus spoiling the revolution. 
  Under the wise leadership of the party and the leader, our 
people have always firmly defended political independence by 
building a self-reliant national economy. It is our party and 
people's firm stance and will that we cannot concede national 
dignity and interest to anyone and that there is nothing to be 
afraid of. 
  Thanks to the strong and self-reliant economy, our party and 
people are able to independently establish a line and policy in 
conformity with our own demands, implement with our own might, 
and exercise the rights as an independent country in a dignified 
manner with complete equality and sovereignty in the 
international arena. 
  The invincible vitality of our party's line for building a 
self- reliant national economy lies in the fact that it 
ceaselessly strengthens the country's material and technological 
base and accelerates economic development at a high speed. To 
strengthen the country's material and technological base and to 
guarantee a high speed in the country's economic development is 
to build a self- reliant national economy. 
  Only when we build a self-reliant economy can we develop a 
stable economy at a high speed and ceaselessly strengthen the 
country's material and technological base under all 
circumstances. 
  Because the South Korean economy is a colonial 
subordination economy heavily relying on outside technology and 
resources, its base is weak and it is deteriorating into a 
bubble economy that is empty inside. By contrast, our economy 
is a powerful economy that enables us to live by our own efforts 
under all circumstances. The material and technological base of 
a self-reliant national economy built with our people's own 
power is very superior and continues to be consolidated. 
  Modern plants and complexes are being built, and numerous 
monumental creations, such as the magnificent and splendid Sohae 
Lock Gate and Kwangbok and Tongil Streets, are being set up in 
our country. This clearly proves the superiority of our 
self-reliant economy. 
  Thanks to powerful self-reliant economy, our party and our 
people, under all circumstances, are rapidly developing an 
economy based on a self-reliant economy. 
  The imperialists and reactionaries are now persistently 
resorting to the political, military pressure and economic 
blockade to isolate and stifle our Republic, which is advancing 
under the uplifted banner of socialism. With the collapse of 
the socialist market of the world, we are faced with a new 
obstacle in external economic relations. Because there is a 
firm self-reliant national economy built with our own efforts, 
our people are developing an economy with initiative. 
  Industrial output increased 50 percent and the average 
annual 
growth of industrial output reached 5.6 percent during the Third 
Seven-Year Plan. This clearly shows how rapidly our 
self-reliant economy continues to develop. The invincible 
vitality of our party's line for building a self-reliant 
national economy lies in the fact that it consistently promotes 
the people's standard of living and fully displays the 
superiority of socialism of our style. 
  The basic purpose of socialist economic construction is to 
promote the people's standard of living. In order to fulfill 
this purpose, socialist construction should be done on the basis 
of self-reliance. 
  Only a self-reliant economy can satisfactorily guarantee the 
people's increasing demand for goods and culture and can highly 
display the superiority of the socialist system. It is a matter 
of course that the people are not ensured with basic goods and 
cultural conditions in capitalist countries where economic 
activities only benefit the few of the privileged class, and in 
the countries where economic life is thoroughly dependent on 
monopolistic foreign capitalists. In our country, all the 
people choose occupations according to ability and propensity 
and enjoy life and happiness, free from any worries over 
clothes, food, and shelter. 
  Our people are enjoying goods and cultural life under the 
benevolence of communism, such as free medical care and free 
compulsory education given by the party and the state. This is 
the true aspect of our society. 
  In this way, in our country, the people's standard of living 
is getting higher as days go by and the superiority of socialism 
is fully displayed. These are unthinkable apart from our firm 
self-reliant national economy. 
  Thanks to our country's superior self-reliant economy, the 
party and the state ensure happy life for the people. All of 
these facts clearly show the superiority of socialism of our own 
style to capitalism and are a proud reality brought forth by a 
self-reliant national economy. 
  Today we are faced with the honorable, yet heavy, task to 
thoroughly carry out the revolutionary economic strategy set 
forth by the party. Only when the party's economic strategy is 
brilliantly implemented can the superiority of a self-reliant 
national economy be further strengthened and a new upturn be 
registered in the people's standard of living and socialist 
construction. 
  All party members and working people, under the wise 
leadership of the party and the leader [suryong], should firmly 
adhere to the line for building a self-reliant national economy 
and thoroughly carry out the revolutionary economic strategy set 
forth by the party.

<F P=106> ["Single-Hearted Unity, Banner of Victory in Our Revolution </F>
" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 26 (KCNA) -- The banner of 
single-hearted unity is a banner of victory under which our 
people firmly defend their revolutionary faith and the socialist 
principle and vigorously advance along the road of socialism 
already chosen by them, says NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined article 
today. 
  The article quotes the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song as 
saying in his New Year address: 
  "Single-hearted unity and self-reliance are the 
imperishable, 
glorious traditions of our revolution and our banner of victory." 
  It goes on: 
  Single-hearted unity of our revolutionary ranks is the most 
durable and mighty one centering on the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il. 
  The single-hearted unity is, first of all, the source of the 
powerful strength which makes it possible to dynamically 
advance the cause of socialism holding the illustrious leader 
in high esteem with loyalty. 
  In our country today all the people are holding the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in high esteem with faith and sense 
of obligation and vigorously advancing with the conviction of 
victory and optimism that we will win certainly because he is 
leading us. 
  The whole party, all the people and the entire Army move as 
one under the unitary leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il and the revolutionary work system of unconditionally 
implementing the idea and lines of the leader has been 
established in the whole party and the whole of society. 
  Thanks to the unbreakable unity of the leader and the people 
in one mind the socialism of our own style has inexhaustible 
might to make a victorious advance, breaking through rigorous 
ordeals and trials. 
  Single-hearted unity of our ranks around the illustrious 
leader is also a powerful weapon in braving all the challenges 
and obstructive moves of the imperialists and the reactionaries 
and firmly defending the cause of socialism of our own style and 
a mighty motive force for the development and prosperity of the 
country. When a grave situation was created in the way of our 
revolution last year, our people and the officers and men of the 
People's Army decisively shattered the challenge and aggression 
moves of the enemy and effected a great upswing in socialist 
construction, united firmly behind the illustrious leader, 
holding a rifle in one hand and a hammer or sickle in the other 
hand, thus fully demonstrating the dignity of the country and 
the heroic stamina of our people. 
  The might of the single-hearted unity of our ranks around 
the 
illustrious leader firmly convinces our people that they can 
defend and accomplish the cause of socialism of our own style, 
not wavering in any storm. 
  In the period of the Third Seven-Year Plan great 
difficulties 
and obstacles were laid in economic construction owing to the 
unexpected international events and the acute situation created 
in our country. But our people, upholding the slogan that when 
the party is determined, we can do anything, pushed on with the 
socialist construction and increased the economic independence 
of the country and its might in every way. This proud victory 
was a great demonstration of our single-hearted unity. 
  Our party put forward the militant tasks to secure a new 
base 
for reaching higher levels of socialism by carrying through the 
revolutionary economic strategy of the party in the period of 
three-year adjustment. 
  The victorious advance and accomplishment of the cause of 
socialism of our own style depend on how to defend 
single-hearted unity, the banner of great victory in our 
revolution. 
  Our people are not a people who will abandon the banner of 
faith, the banner of single-hearted unity they have already 
upheld, no matter what others may say, and not a people who will 
take another road, yielding to any pressure or threat.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jan.26 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- The 
Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) paid senior 
opposition politicians in Malaysia and Singapore tens of 
thousands of dollars without the full knowledge or consent of 
the Canberra Government, according to an Australian newspaper 
report quoting former agents. 
  The report in THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH received here Wednesday, 
said the cash payments from ASIS continued over many years 
beginning when the MPs were junior politicians and increasing as 
the recipients grew in stature. 
  The clandestine payments and their management show ASIS has 
taken upon itself to meddle directly in the internal political 
affairs of a foreign nation without specific authorisation, the 
former field agents claim, the report added. It also quoted the 
former ASIS agents as saying that what started as simple bribes 
snowballed over the years with little reassessment of the value 
or morality of the payments. 
  THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH said the allegations were made during 
its probe into upheavals now confronting ASIS and were supported 
by several former personnel during a series of interviews. The 
former secret agents were demanding a royal commission of 
enquiry into ASIS claiming that it had dangerously minimal 
accountability and was veering out of control. 
  All have various reasons to hold grudges against ASIS but 
say 
their careers were ruined by malicious gossip which points to 
serious internal problems, the report added. 
  Meanwhile, the Australian federal government refused to 
comment on the exposure by THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH. 
  THE CANBERRA TIMES reported that a spokesman for Foreign 
Minister Gareth Evans, responsible for ASIS, said the government 
never commented on intelligence matters.

  [Text] Vientiane, January 27 (KPL) -- The 
Savannakhet-Mukdahan border checkpoint on January 25 was 
declared the third international border checkpoint with the 
agreement of both Lao and Thai authorities. The declaration is 
to facilitate the visit of the Lao and Thai people as well as 
foreign visitors to a third country. The upgrading of this 
border checkpoint is hoped to facilitate tourism and trade 
through Laos between Thailand and Vietnam. 
  Since 1990, there are 80,000-100,000 in-coming and out-going 
passengers each year through the Savannkhet-Mukdahan border 
checkpoint. 
  On January 5, Savannakhet and Quang Tri Province opened 
their 
border checkpoint. 
  Until now, Laos has opened three such checkpoints with 
Thailand: Tha Deua-Nong Khai in Vientiane Prefecture and Nong 
Khai Province of Thailand, Houai Sai-Chiang Khong between the 
northern Laotian Province of Bokeo and Chiang Rai Province in 
northern Thailand, and Savannakhet-Mukdahan international border 
checkpoint. 
  Savannakhet is a province in the central part of the country 
and Mukdahan is a northeastern province of Thailand.

  [Text] Thais who have been caught illegally entering Laos 
are allegedly being mistreated and tortured at Pak Se prison in 
Champassak, Laos, and about one hundred have died, according to 
a former prisoner. One Thai who was released from the prison 
last week, Anonglak Khambunruang, 23, told reporters that Thais 
jailed there face cruelty and misery. They have lost contact 
with their families for a long time. 
  "It's hell. Some people have been crippled in their hands 
and legs. The Laotian officers treat us as if we were animals. 
We are waiting for the help of the Thai Government." 
  About one hundred Thais from Si Sa Ket, Bangkok, Ubon 
Ratchathani, and Chumphon are allegedly being held in Pak Se 
prison. The prison is a one-storey building with four rooms, 
each holding up to 60 Thai prisoners, he said, adding that many 
of them have been held for at least eight months without knowing 
when they will be released. 
  The only way they will be discharged is if relatives file a 
guarantee and post bail with Laotian authorities. Some will 
never get out unless the Government helps them because they have 
lost contact with their families. 
  Mr Anonglak accused the Laotians of chaining Thai prisoners 
by their feet to a rack two feet above the floor. They are also 
not allowed to talk. Those who violate rules are handcuffed by 
their hands and feet to a beam for three days he claimed. 
  Mr Anonglak said they were fed twice a day with sticky rice, 
salt, seasoning powder and chili, which is left over from the 
meals of Laotian prisoners. 
  Thai prisoners are held in contempt, he said. When one dies, 
their bodies are left in chains. Sometimes, Laotian officers 
put four bodies of Thai prisoners in a sack and trample on it, 
he claimed. He and four friends from Ban Woen Buk, Ubon 
Ratchathani Province, were arrested on January 2 while they were 
celebrating New Year's at the house of friends in Ban Don Ko, 
Tambon Sa Pai in Laos, which is opposite their village. He said 
he went to Laos at his friends' invitation. 
  For the trip to the police station in Ban Sa Pai, he and his 
friends were shackled by their hands and feet and had weapons 
pointed at their heads, he said. 
  After being transferred to Se Labam, they were starved for 
three days and forced to lie on the backs with their hands and 
feet chained to the bars of a cell. They were moved to Pak Se 
prison where more than 100 Thai prisoners were earlier detained, 
he said. 
  Mr Anonglak was released from prison after his relatives 
posted bail with Laotian officials on January 21.

  [Text] In today's issue, NHAN DAN carries an editorial 
entitled: Lead the Country to a New Development Stage Step by 
Step to welcome the success of the Midterm National Party 
Conference. The editorial reads in part: 
  We still have to overcome many weaknesses and shortcomings. 
Nonetheless, those important achievements have created new 
opportunities and premises for us to gradually lead the country 
to a new development stage and accelerate the national 
industrialization and modernization program a step further. Our 
country is facing great challenges, namely, the danger of left 
farther behind economically compared with many countries in the 
region and other parts of the world, the danger of deviating 
from the socialist path in case we fail to overcome 
irregularities in direction for implementation, the very serious 
development of corruption and bureaucracy, and the hostile 
forces' peaceful evolution strategy and maneuvers. We have 
great opportunities but also face great challenges. 
  In reflecting the will of the entire party, the conference 
maintained that we have the possibility and determination to 
grasp opportunities and overcome challenges. It maintained that 
we are resolved to motivate the entire party, people, and army 
to display single-mindedness, make outstanding efforts, heighten 
the spirit of independence and self-sufficiency and self-help, 
broaden international cooperation, practice frugality, instill 
honesty, uphold righteousness, make every effort to exploit 
advantages, eliminate dangers, overcome challenges, and 
successfully materialize the general goals set by the Seventh 
Party Congress. The conference is also resolved to accelerate 
the implementation of the objectives of the socioeconomic 
stablization and development strategy for the period till the 
year 2000, and to strive to turn into reality the goals of 
making the people rich and the country powerful and to bring 
about justice and civilization in society. 
  The conference stressed the need to effect economic 
restructuring to serve the industrialization and modernization 
goals. From now until the end of the decade, let us pay special 
attention to the industrialization and modernization program to 
benefit agriculture and the rural economy. As the conference 
put it, this program is part of the key tasks for the days 
ahead. This is the way for our country to overcome the danger 
of being left farther behind compared with the neighboring 
countries, to maintain political stability and social order, 
safeguard national independence and sovereignty, and persist in 
the socialist path. 
  To this end, we must adopt uniform measures to carry out the 
multisectorial economic development policy and create even more 
favorable conditions for the different economic sectors and 
business establishments to develop quickly and achieve high 
results. It is necessary to form a uniform market mechanism 
under state management that is in accordance with socialist 
orientations. It is important to pay due attention to social 
and cultural issues as well as consolidate national defense and 
security capabilities. Continued efforts must be made to 
broaden diplomatic relations and build a law-governed Vietnamese 
state which belongs to, comes from, and works for the people so 
as to make the country advance quickly and firmly under all 
circumstances. 
  Speaking at the Midterm National Party Conference, Comrade 
General Secretary Do Muoi said: Lying ahead of us is a new era 
full of bright prospects, great challenges that we must be 
resolved to overcome, and favorable opportunities that we must 
exploit to the full extent. 
  To seize opportunities and overcome ordeals, our party must 
upgrade itself in proportion to its tasks. It must be renovated 
and rectified. Ties between the party and the people must be 
consolidated. We must ensure political and ideological unity 
within the party, that party cadres and members are thoroughly 
aware of party concepts and policy lines, that they improve 
their knowledge and persist on their path toward socialism, and 
that all party organizations and every party cadre and member 
can creatively apply and develop Marxism-Leninism, Ho Chi Minh 
thought, and the best contemporary ideas, and sensitively 
acquire new things and correctly deal with issues that arise. 
  We must strengthen the unity bloc within the party, apply 
various organizational principles to party activities, 
especially the principle of democratic centralism, build the 
party into a steadfast bloc, and be more mindful of 
consolidating and strengthening grass-roots party organizations 
and consolidating the close relations between the party and the 
people. 
  We must strive to study to improve our knowledge and build 
our revolutionary ethics and a wholesome lifestyle. These are 
the most important things in party building. Party cadres and 
members must constantly improve their knowledge and their actual 
organizational abilities, associate themselves closely with the 
people, scrupulously comply with party resolutions and 
directives and state laws, exemplarily carry out the motto of 
industry, thrift, integrity, and righteousness, and resolve to 
fight wasteful spending, corruption, and illegal dealings. As 
an immediate task, they must successfully carry out the 
resolution of the midterm national party conference and must 
take the lead in guiding the entire society in achieving the 
general goals set forth by the seventh party congress for the 
period until 1995. This means overcoming difficulties and 
ordeals, stabilizing and developing socioeconomic activities, 
enhancing political stability, dispelling negativism and social 
injustices, and basically tiding the country over the crisis in 
the advance toward building a prosperous people, a powerful 
country, and an equal and civilized society.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 27 KYODO -- The government is not yet 
considering changing the date of the meeting between Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton 
slated for February 11, a top Finance Ministry official said 
Thursday [27 January]. But the official also said if the 
cabinet resigns en masse following possible failure to enact 
political reform bills in the Diet, "the summit meeting will be 
canceled." 
  "Depending on the timing and manner of resignation, the 
schedule (for the meeting) will be altered," the official said. 
  Hosokawa, who staked his job on enacting the bills before 
the 
current Diet session ends on Saturday, could come under 
political pressure to resign or call an election if the 
government's bills are abandoned, political analysts said.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 27 (YONHAP) -- The government maintained 
Thursday that the likely decision to deploy U.S. Patriot anti- 
missile batteries in South Korea was long planned by Seoul and 
Washington and is unrelated to the current situation on the 
Korean peninsula. 
  Some, including the opposition camp, are anxious and tense 
over the decision's impact on negotiations on the North Korean 
nuclear problem and the threat of an attack. 
  Government officials said Seoul has long asked the Pentagon 
to send the defensive antimissile batteries and that the 
decision is unrelated to North Korea's suspected nuclear 
program, but voiced worries over possible tension on the Korean 
peninsula because of the move. 
  Chongwadae [presidential offices] confirmed Wednesday's 
foreign press reports on the plan, saying it was long worked out 
and is just being materialized now and has no connection to the 
current situation on the Korean peninsula or the nuclear 
negotiations. 
  Washington is looking into the delivery now in time with its 
withdrawal of the missiles in Europe, a presidential aide said, 
adding that linking the matter with the North Korean nuclear 
issue was seriously wrong. 
  The Patriot system, which emerged as a hero in the Gulf war, 
is designed to protect airfields by knocking incoming missiles 
off course or destroying them in the air. 
  Another presidential aide said deployment of the Patriot 
missiles is just a defense for South Korean air and sea ports, 
adding that he is worried that Pyongyang might "abuse" Seoul's 
decision. 
  Without openly opposing the move to improve national 
security, the Foreign Ministry cautiously expressed worries at a 
possible negative effect on ongoing negotations on nuclear 
inspections between Pyongyang and the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  A Foreign Ministry official said he had heard the 
Pentagon's idea met little opposition from the State Department, 
but that Washington is looking at it positively because it 
cannot deny a request from the senior U.S. commander in Korea. 
  Foreign press reports say that Gen. Gary luck, chief 
commander of American forces in Korea, made the suggestion, 
which is likely to be approved by President Bill Clinton. 
  "How can we (Seoul) oppose it when the U.S. Government has 
approved the plan?" asked the official. 
  A second Foreign Ministry official said that there was a 
small possibility that U.S. arms dealers had some say on the 
issue, it will cause a controversy if Washington asks Seoul to 
buy Patriot missiles later. 
  In recommending the move, Luck said that Patriot 
anti-missile 
batteries were necessary for the safety and security of the 
South Korean population. 
  But there are arguments that the Patriot system, which takes 
quite a time to launch its anti-missile missiles, is ineffective 
on the Korean peninsula because of the many mountains and short 
distances involved. 
  Some observers say they suspect Washington's motivation in 
selling the anti-missile batteries to Korea when they proved 
poor at shielding large populated areas from attack in the Gulf 
war. [sentence as received] 
  Lawmakers are keeping a wary eye on the reported U.S. plan 
to deploy Patriot missile batteries in South Korea in view of 
the cost requirements, though they expect that the advanced 
system, once deployed, to counter-balance North Korea's nuclear 
weapons development program. 
  Chong Chae-mun, chairman of the assembly foreign affairs and 
national unification committee, is for deployment of the system 
but says that the Patriot batteries should be removed when North 
Korea is cleared of nuclear suspicion. 
  Rep. So Su-chong, DLP [Democratic Liberal Party] defense 
committee manager, says the effect on North Korea's nuclear 
development program is important and the anti-missile missiles 
will have the effect of pressing North Korea to give up its 
nuclear weapons development program. 
  Rep. Kwak Yong-tal (DLP) calls for a cautious approach to 
the 
issue, saying the government should take into full consideration 
the economic burden of deployment and maintenance of the Patriot 
batteries. 
  Rep. Kang Chang-song (DP) [Democratic Party] agrees to 
short-term deployment but wants an in-depth study of the 
political and strategic aspects of the presence of these 
anti-missile systems in the country and of the cost. 
  His party's position is more cautious, with the DP saying 
the 
deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea may provoke North 
Korea. 
  Rep. Cho Sun-sung, chairman of the DP national unification 
and international relations committee, is worried that the 
presence of the missiles in South Korea may provoke Pyongyang to 
downgrade its relations with Seoul from bad to worse. 
  It is desirable to make a decision on this issue after the 
International Atomic Energy Agency takes action on the North 
Korean nuclear issue in its Board of Governors meeting slated 
for Feb. 21, because the Patriot missile deployment issue is 
closely related to the North Korean nuclear issue, he says. 
  The Patriot missile deployment plan may be considered an 
expression of Washington's firm stance on the North Korean 
nuclear issue, he adds. 
  Rep. Yim Pok-chin (DP) says the government should approach 
the issue guardedly because deployment of Patriot missile 
batteries in relation to North Korea's nuclear development 
program may upset Pyongyang. 
  Rep. Chong Tae-chol (DP) says he is worried about the 
proposed Patriot missile deployment in the country because it is 
based on North Korea's development of nuclear warheads. He also 
doubts the Patriot's effectiveness, quoting a report of the 
South Korean joint chiefs of staff as saying Patriots are not 
effective in intercepting North Korea's Scud missiles.

<F P=106> [By John McBeth in Jakarta] </F>
  [Text] Benny Murdani is not just another general. The 
former defence minister and armed forces chief holds no official 
position, but is known to wield considerable clout in the 
ambiguous world of Indonesian power politics. No wonder when 
reports surfaced that the government would restructure and 
downsize the Strategic Intelligence Body or Badan Inteligen 
Strategis (Bais), it was seen as a move to deflate his 
influence. Bais, Murdani's former power base, serves as the 
military's eyes and ears on domestic and international affairs. 
  The intelligence agency, which grew out of the smaller 
Strategic Intelligence Centre in 1983, is also having its 
headquarters moved from Tebet in southeast Jakarta to a new 
building at Pasar Minggu in the southern suburbs. This will 
deprive Murdani of the office he is said to maintain at Bais. 
However, it is unlikely to diminish the influence of a man 
whose allies have been in the intelligence service for 20 years 
or more. Armed forces spokesman Brig.-Gen. Syarwan Hamid will 
only say a reorganisation is under way. But there are 
suggestions that the number of sections in Bais will be reduced 
and that its name will be changed to Badan Intelijen ABRI 
[Indonesian Armed Forces] (BIA) or Intelligence Agency of the 
Armed Forces. "Some of its functions are being dropped and I 
think its powers are being dispersed," an intelligence source 
told the REVIEW. It is understood that Bais might no longer 
come under the direct command of armed forces chief Gen. Feisal 
Tanjung, who serves as the organisation's nominal head and the 
president's personal representative within it. Instead, it may 
be placed under the supervision of the chief of general staff, 
Lieut. Gen. H. B. L. Mantiri, and the assistant chief of staff 
for intelligence, Maj.-Gen. Bantu Harjito. 
  According to some versions, the restructuring could lead to 
some Bais functions passing to the Badan Koordinasi Intelijen 
Nasional (Bakin), or the National Intelligence Coordinating 
Agency. Not everyone is convinced the revamp will be all that 
far-reaching. "Murdani created Bais to give direct advice to the 
president," said one Indonesian analyst with ties to the 
military. "The palace guard is under Bais and if control of the 
agency goes to armed forces headquarters, then it means the 
whole of the guard will be under that headquarters. I don't 
know if the president would like such an arrangement." 
  On top of that is the question of who will provide 
Indonesia's intelligence overview. In theory, there is 
considerable overlap between Bais and Bakin, but in practice 
Bais is clearly the preeminent agency. Staffed purely by 
military personnel, it is better trained and has better 
resources than its more civilianised counterpart. Bakin is 
regarded as a sleepy sinecure with a somewhat elastic staff. 
Its mission, according to current chief Sudibyo, is to 
"strengthen national resilience." 
  In describing the role of Bais, Australian academic Richard 
Tanter says the term "strategic" refers to the broad interests 
of the state, "rather than the narrow definition of military 
affairs or international geopolitics." This, in turn, is taken 
to mean domestic political intelligence, and perhaps operations 
against such targets as East Timorese refugees in Australia and 
Portugal. 
  Up to now, Bais has worked closely with the armed forces' 
social and political affairs directorate and also the 
politically significant Home Affairs Ministry and 
attorney-general's office. Senior officers of the Kopassus 
[Special Forces Command] special forces regiment are routinely 
rotated through the agency. Kopassus commander Brig.-Gen. Agum 
Gumelar and Jakarta military commander Maj.-Gen. Hendro Priyono 
have both served as Bais deputies. 
  Rumours of the change in Bais have been circulating since 
July 1993, not long after President Suharto dropped Murdani from 
his cabinet in a move seen to reflect his displeasure at the 
minister's political manoeuvrings. It was the same month 
retired Lieut.-Gen. Sayidiman Suryohadiprojo became the first 
senior officer to openly criticise Murdani and what he called 
the "excessive role" of military intelligence during the 1980s. 
  Suryohadiprojo, a staff officer for most of his career, is 
now one of four roving ambassadors charged with assisting 
Suharto in his capacity as chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement. 
He also acts as an adviser to influential Research and 
Technology Minister B. J. Habibie. Murdani is known to be at 
odds with Habibie, who has also accumulated enemies among 
serving military officers for his interference in arms purchases. 
  When Murdani became armed forces chief in 1983, he retained 
concurrent control over Bais and took direct charge of the 
Command for Restoration of Security and Order (Kopkamtib), the 
powerful security apparatus formed in the wake of the abortive 
1965 communist coup. Over the next five years he built a 
formidable power centre that was second to none in the military 
and on which Suharto depended for his counsel. 
  Observers noted that when Murdani finally stepped down as 
armed forces chief in early 1988 to take over the defence 
portfolio, the Bais leadership passed into the hands of his 
long-serving deputy, Maj.-Gen. Mohammad Sutarjo, instead of 
Murdani's successor, Gen. Try Sutrisno, the current 
vice-president. One of the first overt moves to clip Murdani's 
wings came in September 1988, when Suharto dismantled Kopkamtib 
and effectively ended the defence minister's control over the 
security apparatus. Although the process, known as 
"deBennyisasi," seemed to accelerate with Murdani's departure 
from the cabinet, Indonesian observers still see his status as 
enigmatic. "On the one hand, the president wants to reduce his 
power, but on the other he realises Benny can be very 
supportive," said one source. 
  Last March, the outgoing defence minister caused a major 
stir 
by throwing a reception for 1,500 guests to mark the launching 
of a book on his often shadowy career. Six months later, three 
heads of state and a galaxy of political figures from Indonesia 
and the region showed up at the wedding reception for his only 
daughter. 
  Since then, Murdani has kept a low profile. But that has not 
prevented rumours about his perceived behind-the-scenes role in 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's surprise visit last 
October and, more recently, in the intrigue attending Megawati 
Sukarnoputri's election as chairman of the Indonesian Democratic 
Party. Typically, however, there is not a shred of evidence 
connecting him to any of it.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The United States Now in High Spirits for </F>
Economic Revival"; from Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 27 January 
Morning Edition] 
  [Text] The annual policy speech the U.S. President makes 
to Congress at the beginning of the year is called "state of the 
union address" in English. Most of the one hour-odd speech 
given by President Bill Clinton on the evening of 25 January 
(morning of 26 January Japan time) was devoted to the economy, 
health care reform, education, welfare, and other domestic 
issues. It was literally a speech worthy of the term "state of 
the union address." 
  It was a speech devoid of the pretentious rhetoric 
characteristic of most presidential addresses, and was a piece 
of pragmatic discourse focusing on policy. While some say it 
was not a speech becoming the president of a major power, 
considering Clinton's position as the President of a United 
States with declining power in the post-Cold War world, which is 
exerting desperate efforts toward economic revival, his speech 
was straightforward and made a favorable impression. 
  One year ago, when the first baby boomer president took 
office, few, even inside the Democratic Party, believed that 
Clinton's economic policies would be successful. However, as 
Japan and the nations on the European continent moan under an 
economic recession, the U.S. economy is now definitely on its 
way to recovery. 
  One can sense confidence in his policy direction and his own 
leadership from the President's speech, which puts across the 
optimistic atmosphere that has come back to U.S. society after a 
long time. 
  The president used the word "renewal" many times. Although 
proud of the achievements in the past year, he said: "We know 
and acknowledge that our work has just begun. There is more to 
be done." 
  Although Clinton is in a tight spot over the appointment of 
a 
defense secretary, and scandals have created controversies in 
the mass media, his popularity rating has recovered, and his 
administration is basically stable. 
  Clinton plans to carry on with administrative and fiscal 
reforms, and reduce federal government personnel by 252,200 in 
five years. He stressed that "we will work hard for the American 
people, who pay our salaries." 
  The President strongly advocated the reform of the health 
care system, where "58 million Americans have no coverage at 
all." In this health care reform, of which Mrs. Hillary Clinton 
is in charge, the president spoke of "the courage to face up to 
the special interests obstructing the reform." 
  Lights did not go off in the White House until the late 
hours 
for days on end. Meetings were held with the President even 
late at night or early in the morning. Expensive restaurants in 
the neighborhood complained that they were out of business 
because the White House staff never came out to eat. 
  Foreign affairs will be the task for the hardworking 
President from now on. "There are some who argue that with the 
end of the Cold War, the United States should turn its back on 
the rest of the world," but the President asserted that "we will 
not stop our contributions to the world." He expressed the 
intention to continue to exercise leadership in building a new 
world order. 
  The word "Japan" did not appear at all in the speech. 
However, President Clinton has to take Japan into 
consideration, whether as a partner or as a competitor, in many 
of the things he wants to do from now on. 
  In that sense, one cannot help being apprehensive about how 
the United States will behave at the Japan-U.S. summit in 
February, which will discuss the economic framework talks.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. President Challenging Domestic </F>
Administrative Reforms"] 
  [Text] In his State of the Union address, U.S. President 
Bill Clinton disclosed his administrative policies for the 
second year since his inauguration. In his speech, the 
President expressed his determination to tackle domestic 
administration reforms in a positive way. His policies include 
the reform of the medical insurance system, an effort to renew 
the United States' strength; the revision of the welfare system; 
and the strengthening of anticrime measures. It is hoped that 
efforts to reform the domestic administration will lead to the 
enhancement of U.S. leadership in the world. 
  Generally speaking, it has been observed that during the 
first year of the Clinton administration, "there were some 
losses," but "there were more gains," (as stated by the 
WASHINGTON POST). What can be termed as achievements include: 
the approval of the bill on reducing financial deficit; the 
approval of the bill on weapons regulations; and the approval of 
NAFTA. 
  President Clinton, who is now in the second year of his 
term, 
has pledged further efforts for economic reconstruction, and at 
the same time, has called for strengthening anticrime measures 
as one of the top priority tasks. Because public security has 
deteriorated, particularly in big cities, he wants to set 
stricter penalties for those who choose to commit crimes. Among 
the measures to be taken are the addition of 100,000 police 
throughout the United States and an expansion of the death 
penalty for violent crimes. 
  Moreover, President Clinton also touched on such measures as 
the creation of jobs; professional training for the purpose of 
reemployment; enhancement of education; and the strengthening of 
the information industry. In particular, he is determined to 
carry out some reforms such as the health care reform that all 
postwar Presidents have tried to avoid. His stance on 
positively tackling reforms that could result in pains among the 
people certainly deserves appraisal. 
  In this speech, President Clinton clearly stated that 
priority will now be given to domestic issues. It is probably 
because he has taken the by-election this fall into 
consideration. But now that the economy is on the right track 
toward recovery and the President is gaining greater backing 
from the general public, it is hoped that he will be able to 
carry out these policies as he has pledged. 
  On the other hand, there are factors that have aroused 
concerns over the Clinton administration. For example, there is 
the slow process of making personnel appointments and a 
rekindling of personal scandals. 
  Last December, President Clinton accepted Defense Secretary 
Aspin's resignation and then nominated Inman, former deputy 
director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as his 
successor. However, Mr. Inman has rejected the nomination and so 
has an influential senator who was regarded as a likely 
successor. And finally, Deputy Defense Secretary Perry has been 
nominated for the post. 
  Moreover, President Clinton has no other choice but to agree 
to the appointment of a special prosecutor because of the 
rekindling of the political fund scandal that took place during 
his Arkansas governorship years. 
  All these concerns may result in the gradual loss of 
confidence in the President. And people may lose confidence not 
merely in his capability in handling domestic affairs. Some 
West European nations have now come to cherish apprehensions 
about the United States' foreign and security policies. 
  In this post-Cold War age with less danger of nuclear 
weapons, President Clinton is promoting an economy-oriented 
diplomacy while giving priority to safety at home over national 
security. Moreover, concerning settlement of regional 
conflicts, Clinton has stressed the functions of the United 
Nations and the sharing of responsibilities by major countries. 
  During his address, President Clinton touched on issues 
concerning foreign and security policies but his remarks were 
made merely in general terms. In addition to touching on the 
situations on the Korean peninsula, in China, in former 
communist countries, in the Middle East, and in South Africa, 
President Clinton stressed the need for providing continuous 
assistance to Russia in its efforts for democratization. 
However, we had hoped that he would also have touched on the 
new role for the United States in his post-Cold War world as 
well as on practical measures for settling regional conflicts. 
  As the President has stated, there still exist dangerous 
situations in various parts of the world at present. And for 
the United States, which still enjoys a strong influence in this 
post-Cold War world, its responsibility lies not only in 
tackling the reform of its own domestic administration but also 
in taking a strong initiative for the sake of the international 
community.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "High Hopes Pinned on President Clinton for </F>
Domestic Reform"] 
  [Text] The problem facing the United States is U.S. 
society itself. President Clinton, in his State of the Union 
Address to Congress, devoted a large portion of it to domestic 
problems. In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton 
made clear his administration's position that the foundation for 
"reconstructing the United States" will be built through 
domestic reform. 
  The State of the Union Address entitled "On the Present 
Situation of the United States" is an annual report given by the 
President to the American people. President Clinton's State of 
the Union Address reflected very forthrightly the present 
situation of the United States, and gave us a good impression. 
  The Clinton administration has met with many difficulties 
since its inauguration. Looking back on what his administration 
has done over the past year, we find some of its accomplishments 
worthy of receiving high marks. 
  Among other things, we would like to point out that the U.S. 
economy has steadily recovered ahead of Japan and European 
nations. While the growth rate has gone up, the jobless rate has 
gone down, and the federal budget deficit is on the decline. 
Among other things, the entire American society appears to be 
regaining confidence and vitality with the restoration of its 
competitiveness. 
  The U.S. economy began picking up in the closing months of 
the Bush administration. It is true, however, that the Clinton 
administration's economy policy, including the enactment of a 
fiscal coordination act aimed at cutting the federal budget 
deficit, has consolidated the foundation for economic recovery. 
  The adoption of a national service system designed to 
encourage young Americans to participate in society, and the 
enactment of the Brady Act designed to keep guns under control 
can be cited as accomplishments by the Clinton administration 
that have promoted change in the United States. 
  After praising those accomplishments, President Clinton 
focused his State of the Union Address on the present state of 
American society and sought the American people's awareness and 
cooperation, saying, "There are still a lot of things we have to 
do." 
  What the President most emphatically stressed in the address 
is reform of the current medical insurance system on which Mrs. 
Hillary [as published] has worked. Tens of millions of 
Americans do not benefit from the system, and they are said to 
be unable to live free of everyday concerns. We cannot help but 
be surprised at the President's forthrightness regarding the 
present situation of the United States. 
  During the era when the U.S. economic strength was dominant 
in the world and the pie shared by the American people, 
including immigrants from all parts of the world, continued to 
grow, the thorough individualism and self-help spirit were a 
source of the vitality and diversity of the United States, an 
ethnically diversified nation. 
  However, even the encouragement of self-help has been unable 
to keep a growing number of Americans from being estranged from 
society since the United States entered an era when the pie's 
growth was sluggish or dropped at times. What the medical 
insurance issue raises is the inconsistency of politics that has 
failed to respond to changing times. 
  In his address, the President also stressed the need to cope 
with crime and work to keep the family from collapsing. As for 
measures to prevent crime, the argument for gun control has so 
far been powerless against the insistence that individuals have 
the right and freedom to have guns in order to protect 
themselves or hunt. We hope the Clinton administration will use 
the Brady Act to take effective measures to strengthen gun 
control. 
  Whether the United States, which as sole superpower has a 
great influence on the world, will succeed in domestic reform is 
a question to which we cannot be apathetic. We think so because 
a healthy American society will ultimately provide a basis for 
America's balanced foreign policy; not because the contradiction 
and evils of American society have spread to Japanese society in 
the past. 
  The Clinton administration has often been criticized for 
failing to shape a comprehensive foreign policy. In his 
address, the President slightly touched on his foreign policy 
but did not put forth a U.S. vision of the post-Cold War world. 
We would like to see the Clinton administration present a clear 
outline of its foreign policy taking into account its bitter 
experiences of the past year, including the deadlocks in Somalia 
and Haiti.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S. Administration Which Turns Its </F>
Attention More Toward Domestic Affairs"] 
  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton, who has entered the 
second year since his inauguration, gave his State of the Union 
address in Congress on 25 January. A major portion of his 
address dealt with domestic issues and made little reference to 
diplomatic issues. President Clinton, who became President by 
advocating his plan "to rebuild America," originally indicated 
that he planned to place emphasis on domestic affairs. On top 
of this, off-year elections are to be held this coming fall. As 
a result, he has apparently made it clearer that he intends to 
turn his attention more toward internal affairs. 
  The President's State of the Union address includes an 
outline of the U.S. Government's domestic and diplomatic 
policies over the coming year. Particularly since this was 
Clinton's first such address, it has attracted the world's 
attention. However, it could not avoid being rated as 
unimpressive due to its domestic affairs-oriented content. 
  In his address, the President praised himself for "making a 
good start" concerning his first year at running the government. 
According to research by a periodical specializing in 
Congressional affairs, over 84 percent of the bills reaching 
Congress during Clinton's first year as President were passed. 
Since the periodical began such research in the early 1950's, 
this figure ranks third after former Presidents Dwight D. 
Eisenhower and Lyndon B. Johnson. It shows Clinton's 
extraordinary leadership over Congressional steering. 
  When Clinton was first inaugurated, critics charged that his 
policies lacked focus and were inconsistent. However, 
supporters praised his uncompromising realism. Generally, 
experts give high ratings to Clinton for his accomplishments 
during his first year as President. His declined support rating 
has resurged to the 60-percent level he enjoyed at the time of 
his inauguration. 
  Recovery of the U.S. economy has been the greatest 
contributing factor in Clinton's regaining his popularity. 
Whether the President can also make dazzling achievements 
during his second year depends on whether he can ride on the 
favorable winds of the time. 
  As prime priority policy goals for his second year, the 
President presented three pillars: fight against crime, health 
care system reform, and welfare system reform. Concerning the 
fight against crime which is of the greatest interest to the 
American people, Clinton has already sent a comprehensive crime 
prevention bill to Congress that includes recruiting 100,000 
more policemen. As part of the crime prevention plan, a law on 
hand gun control was enacted last year. It is hoped that 
greater gun control will be promoted, such as introducing a 
system requiring gun licenses. 
  Concerning health care system reform which aims at having 
every American covered under health insurance, President Clinton 
hopes that Congress will pass the bill worked out under the 
leadership of Hillary Clinton, the First Lady. Tentatively, the 
focus of attention will be on the contest between this bill and 
a number of other bills proposed by some Congressmen which 
Congress is currently examining. 
  The President has decided to continue with his plan to give 
priority to problems of the people and boldly deal with social 
issues which tend to be ignored. 
  The greatest task facing President Clinton is that of 
solidifying his foundation for reelection by having his party 
win in the off-year elections. The President hopes to form a 
majority that encompasses a broad range of the population by 
winning over the middle class in addition to traditional 
Democratic supporters. He will need to patch up relations with 
leaders of the Democratic Party and labor unions with whom he 
clashed regarding ratification of NAFTA. He also needs to 
quickly regain public confidence that has been lost due to 
consecutive scandals involving women and the Whitewater scandal. 
  Regarding diplomatic affairs, a task has emerged for the 
President to reconstruct his team in charge of diplomacy and 
national security, as this team has been considered a weak point 
in the Clinton administration. Bobby Inman, who at first agreed 
to succeed Les Aspin as secretary of defense after the latter 
announced his resignation, decided not to accept his nomination. 
Finally, William J. Perry, deputy secretary of defense, was 
just promoted to fill the post. There has also been deep-rooted 
criticism against Secretary of State Warren Christopher and 
Anthony Lake, assistant to the President for national security 
affairs. 
  In his State of the Union address, President Clinton 
indicated U.S. leadership is essential to global stability. For 
the United States to exercise its leadership without repeating 
the mistakes it has made in Somalia, Haiti, and former 
Yugoslavia, it is indeed necessary to promptly form a strong 
team to handle diplomacy and national security.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The 4 November Tokyo NIKKEI KINYU 
SHIMBUN in Japanese, page 1, carries an article by reporter 
Sadaharu Shimizu noting that the large Japanese banks operating 
in the United States have begun to expand financing activities 
to U.S. companies. 
  The article notes that last year, in the United States as 
well as in Japan, Japanese banks "gave priority to the disposal 
of nonperforming assets," and thus were generally cautious about 
increasing their loan assets, But as of the end of September 
1993, the capital adequacy ratios of the top-tier banks rose 
above 9.5 percent "across the board," so that the "specter" 
presented by the 8-percent capital adequacy ratio set by the 
Bank for International Settlements [BIS] has "faded away." 
This, coupled with the fact that the demand for capital in 
Japan is sluggish due to the prolonged recession, that "the 
amount of financing per deal in the rapidly growing Asian market 
is small," and because the banks seek to "maintain their 
earnings in the international sector," has led the Japanese 
banks to shift toward the U.S. corporate market for new lending 
opportunities. 
  According to the article, Sanwa Bank has set its goal for 
the 
second half of FY93 to increase financing in the U.S. "by just 
over 6 percent compared to the first half of FY93." The 
Industrial Bank of Japan [IBJ] is also proceeding with plans to 
expand American corporate lending by about 6 percent in FY93, 
while the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan [LTCB] plans an 
increase of "5-plus percent" in FY93. 
  Major Japanese commercial and long-term credit banks are 
participating in corporate financing deals led by banking 
groups. Two banks, Sanwa and Mitsubishi, are participating as 
"co-lead managers" in the bank financing of Viacom in its 
attempted buyout of Paramount Communications. IBJ and the Bank 
of Tokyo, which are usually "aggressive" in financing corporate 
takeovers, are also backing Viacom. Financing for QVC, Viacom's 
opponent in the struggle to take over Paramount, is being led by 
the LTCB. Several banks, including Sanwa and Sumitomo, are 
anticipating loans to Eastman Kodak's chemical subsidiary. And 
six banks, including Fuji and LTCB, are expected to join "core 
banks" in extending the "enormous sums" IBM will require for its 
corporate restructuring.

  [Text] "Allowing Japan and the United States, which occupy 
the first and second positions in trade volume, to discuss trade 
policies aimed at setting numerical targets will shake the 
international community's confidence in the market economy." 
The investigation subcommittee for policies and measures to 
prevent unfair trade (with Tokyo University Professor Mitsuo 
Matsushita as chairman) of the Industrial Structure Council, an 
advisory organ to the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry [MITI], has completed a report harshly criticizing the 
United States which has stuck to its demand for "setting up 
numerical targets" at the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, 
and submitted it to MITI Minister Kumagai on 19 January. 
  The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks still remain at 
odds, 
and there is no prospect of a breakthrough in the talks. The 
report aims at providing grounds for Japan's opposition to the 
United States' call for setting up numerical targets. In this 
sense, it seems that, with Japan-U.S. summit talks scheduled for 
11 February, the report will have an impact on the negotiations 
which are entering the final stage. 
  The report defines the United States' demand as "policy that 
allows exporting nations to consider importing nations' markets 
as closed, make importing nations set targets for increasing 
market share of foreign products and purchase amounts, and then 
calls on them to attain such targets." The report also 
concludes that setting a market share of foreign products in a 
third nation as a reference index, and setting up an index to 
measure the ratio of increase in the purchase amount, is 
"similar to setting up numerical targets." 
  The report then points out: "The market share of 
foreign-made 
products depends on domestically-made products' supply 
capability and differences in competitive power between domestic 
and foreign companies. It cannot be said the market is closed 
just because the market share of foreign-products is small." 
The report stresses that if Japan should once set up numerical 
figures, such as target figures or reference index, "there is 
the possibility that Japan will be obliged to attain such target 
figures." It calls on MITI to steadfastly reject the United 
States' demand. 
  Referring to the Japan-U.S. accord on semiconductors, which 
specifies the market share of foreign-made products in Japan, 
the report stresses "it is necessary to rescind the accord 
swiftly." In conclusion the report notes: "Basically, trade 
issues should be solved based on multilateral dispute settlement 
procedures of the (Uruguay Round of) multilateral trade talks."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Trade Frictions Intensify Despite </F>
Negotiations; New Phase in Japanese-U.S. Relations"] 
  [Text] Just like the Japanese economy in 1994, where there 
is no sign of a business recovery whatsoever, there are only 
disheartening factors in Japanese-U.S. relations. 
  First, as for the trade imbalance, which is the basic cause 
of the friction between Japan and the United States, it is 
almost certain that Japan's 1993 trade surplus with the United 
States will reach a high level. It also turned out that the 
Japanese-U.S. comprehensive economic consultations [framework 
talks] which are being held to correct this imbalance have so 
far merely widened the gap between the two countries. For 
example, while the most important point of these talks was 
whether or not Japan will agree to set numerical targets as a 
criterion in measuring the degree of the liberalization of its 
market, it was finally agreed at the Japanese-U.S. summit held 
in July that the vague expression "objective criterion" is to be 
used. 
  Japanese industrial circles, however, are ready to totally 
refuse to accept such targets. At the Japanese-U.S. 
semiconductor talks, it was agreed, as an objective criterion, 
that the "[U.S. semiconductors'] share of the Japanese market 
should be 20 percent." However, this agreement was secretly 
changed to be regarded as a formal agreement between Japan and 
the United States. Because of this bitter past experience, the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] is also 
expressing its intention of totally rejecting numerical targets. 
  In opposing this concept, [MITI] is even expressing its 
rejection of the three major U.S. automobile makers' enumerating 
their numerical targets as being to what extent they want to 
participate in the Japanese market -- that is, how many dealers 
they have in Japan, and how many cars with right-hand drive they 
export to Japan, etc. 
  On the other hand, the United States, which insists that 
Japan set numerical targets, is trying to appease Japan by 
suggesting that a "failure to attain the numerical targets does 
not mean that we will take retaliatory measures." However, the 
Japanese side is not at all willing to accept this proposal. 
The distrust between the two countries is creating the 
deadlocked situation. 
  If the two countries continue to take an uncompromising 
attitude, it is likely that the attitude of the Clinton 
administration toward the Hosokawa government will also largely 
change. Because of its expectations of the new government, the 
Clinton administration has so far to a certain extent given the 
Hosokawa government time to deal with the trade imbalance. 
Therefore, the United States did not make particularly strong 
requests to the Hosokawa government at the Japanese-U.S. summit 
held at the end of September and at the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation conference held at the beginning of November. 
  However, if there is still no sign of compromise at the 
Japanese- U.S. summit scheduled for 11 February, it is 
inevitable that President Clinton's attitude will stiffen. In 
the first place, the Congress will not put up with Japan's 
attitude. Midterm elections are due to be held this year. 
Because all 435 congressmen and one-third of the 100 senators 
face elections, intense pressure will be put on the government 
by congressmen and senators, who attach importance to the 
interests of their respective constituencies. It is impossible 
for President Clinton to disregard such pressure, for he earlier 
received a big favor from the Congress in having NAFTA ratified. 
  The United States cannot expect economic growth unless it 
increases its exports, and as for Japan, it is a "nation which 
is dependent on exports." Under the circumstances, unless such 
a structure is changed, it is inevitable that economic conflicts 
will occur between the two countries. Although we do not hear 
the "theory of the Japanese threat" mentioned anymore, possibly 
because the United States is sympathetic to Japan because of its 
prolonged recession, it is likely that Japanese-U.S. relations 
will face a more serious phase henceforth.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Flexibility Needed in Japan-U.S. Framework </F>
Trade Talks"] 
  [Text] Japan and the United States are in a deadlock over 
individual trade sectors in the bilateral framework trade talks. 
Hardly any progress has been made in talks regarding automobiles 
and auto parts and insurance services. 
  It is still uncertain whether the planned 11 February 
Japan-U.S. summit meeting will be held as scheduled. 
Nevertheless, time is running short. Conseqeuntly, we would 
like to make some suggestions to both Japanese and U.S. 
authorities to help break this deadlock. 
  The issue of setting numerical targets is at the core of 
this 
bilateral trade dispute. Excluding this issue, the trade talks 
have made progress. The United States, however, considers the 
talks unsuccessful if numerical targets are not included in the 
settlement. Likewise, Japan persistently maintains that 
rejection of numerical targets is its bottom line. 
  As we asserted before (in an editorial carried in our 16 
July 
1993 morning edition), it is a mistake for the two nations to 
become dogmatic over this issue. The United States considers 
numerical aims as "targets." Since targets are to be "shot 
through," missing them would result in penalties being imposed. 
  However, Japan would hardly agree to numerical aims with 
penalties attached. In a business world operating under a 
market economy, it is unlikely that government authorities would 
conclude such a suicidal agreement. Should that ever happen, it 
would lead to managed trade. 
  Regarding this point, many noted scholars in the United 
States have expressed opposition to setting numerical targets. 
Both Japan and the United States worked very hard to bring 
GATT's new round of multilateral trade talks (the Uruguay Round) 
to a successful conclusion just recently. Managed trade would 
run counter to this new framework. 
  Meanwhile, there is no reason to reject "goals" if both 
nations can strive together to aim at them. They should try to 
work out a compromise using "benchmarks" with which results can 
be measured objectively. 
  From this viewpoint, it is apparent that the United States 
is 
going to extremes to lay down demands on Japan. It has insisted 
that "market share as in other major industrialized nations" -- 
a figure it has specified regarding access to the 
telecommunications market -- and an increase in "the number of 
dealers to sell foreign automobiles" be specifically written 
down in trade agreements to be concluded. It then plans to 
impose penalties should Japan fail to meet such targets. 
  Another important point is that in the past year, the 
economic environments of both nations have radically changed. 
It has become increasingly clear that the United States has 
gained marked advantage over Japan in competitiveness in the 
fields of electronics and communications. The positions have 
also been reversed in the automobile industry; the United States 
clearly has an advantage over Japan. Remarks that "Japan is of 
little significance" have increasingly been noted in U.S. 
industrial circles. 
  The Japanese Government has a responsibility to increase 
domestic demand in order to reduce the nation's huge trade 
surplus. However, it is not to the advantage of the United 
States for the U.S. Government to act like a bully and try to 
have its way in an area where the nation has already 
strengthened its competitiveness. 
  In any field of business in both nations, there already 
exists a vast network of tie-ups and cooperation linking 
together various firms of both nations as partners. There is a 
limit to the governments' roles in this area. Japanese 
automakers do not call on the Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry [MITI] for counseling when they plan to change 
their trade strategies. What they want is that MITI not make 
any unreasonable commitment to U.S. authorities. 
  Furthermore, some relatively undesirable signs in the 
political foundations of both nations have been noted. Like 
last year, it is still necessary for both nations to continue 
presenting positive proposals, but current circumstances dictate 
that they do not have to continue doing this to the point of 
injuring each other. 
  The administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton has 
carried 
out policies in view of the off-year elections slated for this 
coming fall. However, there is no guarantee that gaining 
visible results from Japan would act favorably in the elections. 
Instead, it should be more important for the United States to 
strive to increase its influence in Asia than Japan. 
  After all, Japan does not have to make excessively strong 
objections against the United States, nor does it have to make 
excessive apologies.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan, the United States Urged To Restore Their </F>
Coordinating Capabilities To Avert Clash"] 
  [Text] The Japan-U.S. relations are becoming tense at a 
time when Japan is reeling from political upheaval. With the 
Japan-U.S. summit talks set to be held on 11 February, no way is 
seen to break the deadlock in the Japan-U.S. economic framework 
talks which have become a focal point in their relations. The 
Clinton administration is increasingly irritated with the 
Hosokawa government which has continued to hesitate to cut the 
income tax and take measures to stimulate Japan's economy. The 
question is that politicians are increasingly looking inward and 
failing to feel a sense of crisis despite its existence as 
ruling and opposition parties are locked in their negotiations 
on a package of political reform bills. 
  What concerns us the most is that both Japan and the United 
States are losing their coordinating capabilities to avert clash 
between them. Looking at the profiles of both Japanese and 
American delegates to the Japan-U.S. vice ministerial economic 
framework talks which are being held in Washington, professional 
bureaucrats from the Foreign Ministry, the Finance Ministry, and 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] are 
attending the talks as Japanese delegates, while lawyers, 
scholars, economists, and former bankers in Wall Street are 
attending the talks as the U.S. delegates. It is said that the 
U.S. delegates are acting based on their consensus of placing 
importance on trade results and speaking in unison at the talks. 
The unity of American bureaucrats is more cohesive than that of 
their Japanese counterparts. 
  The U.S. side has repeatedly insisted on setting numerical 
targets for the sectors of automobile-auto parts, insurance, and 
government procurement. In response, the Japanese side has 
continued to refuse to comply with the U.S. insistence, saying, 
"Setting such numerical targets will lead to managed trade." The 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks have run into rough sailing 
from the start and a way out is not in sight at all. 
  In Japanese-U.S. relations during the Cold War era, the 
coordinating capabilities of the two countries worked on their 
own when their negotiations were deadlocked because they were 
Western allies who were committed to defending the principle of 
free trade. A Japanese negotiator has said that during the Cold 
War era, the State Department and the Treasury Department 
placated the hard-line U.S. Trade Representative and the 
Commerce Department whenever individual trade frictions occurred 
between the two countries and the Defense Department came out to 
defuse the bilateral trade frictions when they got worse. 
Meanwhile, an American negotiator has pointed out that during 
the Cold War era, pro-international trade bureaucrats in the 
Finance Ministry and MITI worked to persuade hard-liners in 
Japan. 
  The leaders of the two countries should display their 
political leadership transcending the bilateral working-level 
talks and the argument between the two countries over free trade 
and managed trade. This is the only way to break the impasse in 
the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks. The Hosokawa 
government has been preoccupied with political reform and this 
cannot be an excuse for the government to leave the 
Japanese-U.S. relations worsened. 
  Rather than continuing to argue against setting the 
numerical 
targets, the Japanese side should present the U.S. side with 
concrete steps to open the Japanese market in the individual 
sector. It goes without saying that the Hosokawa government 
needs to speedily take stimulus measures centering on the income 
tax reduction to pull Japan out of a prolonged recession. Those 
measures also will result in reducing Japan's huge current 
account surplus. We hope that Prime Minister Hosokawa will 
display his leadership when he makes political decisions as he 
said to U.S. Treasury Secretary Bentsen. 
  It is said that President Clinton himself is the 
hardest-liner toward Japan in his administration. With the 
conclusion of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the 
multilateral trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round of GATT), the 
President is now aiming to gain trade results from Japan through 
the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. The President, however, 
should consider that the idea of placing importance on the trade 
results may undermine the relations of G-2 (Japan and the United 
States) which are in a position to jointly manage the post-Cold 
War world economy. 
  The continuing confrontation between Japan and the United 
States at a time when they have to come up with common values 
for the post-Cold War world is unfortunate not only for the two 
countries, but for the world economy.

  [Text] "The Hosokawa administration's hands are full with 
dealing with the political reform issue; it is not thinking at 
all about the problems between Japan and the United States." 
With the Japan-U.S. summit talks coming on 11 February, the 
United States is becoming more and more irritated. 
  According to a Japanese Government source, U.S. officials 
have made informal inquiries about Japan's approach to the 
summit meeting, but policymakers in the government and the 
ruling coalition parties have no time for anything else but 
political reform. They are not in a mood for prior 
consultations on the summit. 
  The summit meeting in February is supposed to be a venue for 
the two leaders to assess the results of the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks. However, a head-on collision has occurred at 
the working level framework talks over the handling of the 
numerical targets, and it has become difficult to come up with 
results that can be taken up at the summit talks. 
  While negotiators on both sides agree that "there can be no 
progress without a political decision by the top leader," the 
Hosokawa administration has shown no sign of taking any action. 
White House officials are becoming increasingly irritated. Some 
U.S. Government officials have even expressed the view that "if 
results cannot be expected from the framework talks, it would be 
better for Japan to ask for a postponement of the summit 
talks...." This is because if the summit meeting ends in 
failure, anti-Japanese feelings may flare up in Congress, and 
the President may be put in a very difficult position. 
  If there should be a postponement of the summit talks, it 
would be a serious diplomatic setback for Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa. It seems that the prime minister's "troubles 
at home and abroad" will continue for awhile.

Japan-U.S. Patent Disputes"] 
  [Text] Armed with "patents," U.S. public and private 
sectors have begun their assault. How can Japanese corporations 
protect themselves from having to pay huge damage claims? 
  Under the Clinton administration, the U.S. Congress approved 
the 1993 National Joint Production Act on 27 May, making it 
possible for rival U.S. companies to enter into joint production 
arrangements, something which they had been severely restricted 
in doing before. Relaxing antitrust policies to boost the 
competitive strength of U.S. companies, legislators seem ready 
to let companies do whatever they can do to improve their 
competitiveness. 
  Now that the cold war has ended, national rivalry has become 
economic rivalry, and under the Clinton administration, the 
newly created National Economic Council was quickly added to the 
already existing National Security Council. One the central 
themes of the new council is protecting and nurturing the growth 
of U.S. high-tech industry, which forms the basis of U.S. 
economic strength. Toward that end, it seems the administration 
is promoting a pro-patent policy, which aims at providing 
greater safeguards for U.S. intellectual property. 
  U.S. history shows two competing attitudes toward patents, 
and the United States has gone through an antipatent period, 
when new technology and discoveries were considered the common 
property of society, as well a pro-patent period, which gives 
precedence to the rights of the inventor. During the 1950's and 
1960's, the heyday of American power, the winds were blowing 
strongly in the direction of a free economy and an antitrust, 
antipatent mood prevailed. 
  In the 1970's, however, key industries like automobiles, 
steel, and home appliances and electronics began showing signs 
of decline and the call went out to strengthen U.S. industrial 
competitiveness. In October 1976, then President Carter 
announced his "industrial technological reform policy." Clearly, 
he was indicating a pro-patent policy as part of U.S. national 
strategy. The secretary of commerce and others who were 
advocating such a policy continued to advise the White House on 
the importance of protecting intellectual property rights even 
after their departure following President Reagan's election. 
  The Reagan administration continued Carter's pro-patent 
policy, further boosting its importance by making it part of the 
administration's national strategy. What sent shock waves 
through the nation was a report by the President's Commission on 
Industrial Competitiveness concerning the competitive 
capabilities of U.S. industry. In that report, which was 
released in January 1985, the chairman, [John A.] Young, 
released an estimate that Americans stood to lose millions of 
dollars if they did not protect their intellectual property 
overseas, clearly taking the stand that intellectual property 
rights were a national interest. 
  As public sentiment grew, the U.S. Congress in 1982 
established a court of appeals in the federal circuit (CAFC) to 
specialize in patent cases. A revised trade act was put through 
in 1988 [1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act], giving 
teeth to patent regulations protecting intellectual property 
rights; the United States also saw the creation of the new 
Section 301 and revisions to Section 337 of the Tariff Act. 
  The revision to Section 337 made it much easier for U.S. 
companies to petition the International Trade Commission (ITC) 
to place a ban on imported foreign products that are in 
violation of existing patents. Again, through Super 301, the 
U.S. Government was required to create a list of countries in 
which intellectual property rights were not being given adequate 
safeguards and to demand that the situation be remedied. 
  When during Japan-U.S. Structural Impediments Initiative 
(SII) talks, a revision to Japan's patent system, including 
efforts to speed up patent investigations, was sought, the 
incident caused a flurry of reporting in the newspapers that is 
still fresh in this writer's memory. 
<H5>  Patent Mafia Active Behind the Scenes </H5>
  Quick to take advantage of this pro-patent tide in the 
United States and turn it into a business is a group of patent 
management companies known as the "patent mafia." 
  One of these patent management companies, Refac Technology 
Development Co., bought the patent for laser-related technology 
developed in 1977 by an inventor named Gordon Gould and then 
sued over 200 prominent companies, including General Motors 
Corp., International Business Machines, and Toshiba Corp. After 
more than 10 years in the courts, Refac was able to get each of 
the companies to sign licensing contracts and even now is 
getting over $10 million in revenue annually as a result. 
  Refac used its experience in the courts to make a career out 
of patent disputes. The one who pushed this strategy to the 
front was the vice president of Refac, Philip Superba. His 
shrewdness has given many of those working with patents at 
Japanese companies cause to weep. The strategy that Superba, 
himself a patent attorney, devised was as follows: 
  First, one of Refac's technical consultants makes the rounds 
of trade shows and companies and painstakingly goes through 
newspapers and magazines to dig up products that are in 
violation of a patent. Next, the company buys the patent in 
question from the inventor. Most times, it is only part interest 
in the patent (about 5 percent). Refac then sends a warning 
notice to manufacturers it thinks are in violation of the 
patent, asking them to sign a licensing agreement. 
  If everything can be settled at this stage, the company is 
promptly paid the licensing fee. 
  If the manufacturer refuses to agree to a licensing 
contract, 
Refac brings the case to court. But instead of filing directly 
against the manufacturer, Refac files its lawsuit against a 
selling agent or shop. For the manufacturer, who values his 
relationship with the agent, there is no other recourse but to 
accept a compromise in order to protect his agent. Refac then 
hires an attorney, hoping for an early settlement, and promises 
to pay the attorney on condition that the case is successfully 
concluded. 
  One of the patents Refac bought was for laser-related 
technology from an inventor named Jerome Lemelson. The 
technology, which has had broad applications, was used in VTR's 
[video tape recorders], laser disks, and laser and magnetic 
memory formats. From an inventor named Melvin Clark, Refac 
brought a patent that had to do with electronic musical 
instruments. 
  Based on the patent for this kind of instrument, Refac sued 
Matsushita, Yamaha, Kawai, and Casio. The case was recently 
settled out of court. 
  Casting sidelong glances at the patent mafia and their 
behind-the-scenes activities, big U.S. companies finally jumped 
into the fray in the mid-1980's, making their imprint on patent 
strategy in some very important ways. Rather than making money 
by creating products, they turned the patents they had been 
accumulating over the years into the seeds of a new business. 
Since licensing fees were a quick way to get cash into their 
coffers, it was an attractive proposition for corporate 
managers, especially when facing fourth quarter statements. 
  The first company to try it was the semiconductor giant, 
Texas Instruments [TI]. Under attack by Japan's semiconductor 
makers, the company's then first vice president, Melvin Sharp, 
was groping for a way to survive. According to one account, when 
he heard that Polaroid stood to gain a huge amount of money in 
damages if the courts ruled in its favor in a patent dispute 
with Eastman Kodak, Sharp slapped his knees and said, "This is 
what we should be doing!" 
  In 1991, after five years in the courts, Polaroid won its 
suit over Kodak, and was awarded over 100 billion yen in damages. 
  Texas Instruments followed suit and in 1986 filed a lawsuit 
against nine semiconductor manufacturers in Japan and Korea, 
claiming they had violated TI's patent rights. The following 
year, the case was settled out of court. The company ended up 
getting over $200,000 from each of the violators in patent-use 
fees, which quickly pulled the company out of the red. 
  Recently, Japan's mass media was kept busy with Honeywell 
Inc. versus Minolta Camera Co. and Jan R. Coyle versus Sega 
Enterprises Ltd. In the end, Minolta was ordered to pay 16.5 
billion yen in damages and Sega, 5.6 billion yen, causing a 
shudder of fear to pass through Japan's corporate world. Both 
cases also drew a lot of attention in Japan because the outcome 
was based on a jury trial, something one doesn't see in Japan. 
  Jerome Lemelson got out-of-court settlements from Japanese 
automakers and electronics manufacturers under a patent related 
to the automatic inspection and imaging devices used on 
production lines. Usage fees are said to have amounted to a 
total of 50 billion yen. He has now turned his attention to 
automobile parts manufacturers. 
<H5>  Behind Skyrocketing Damage Awards </H5>
  Actions from the 1980's to grow money trees from patents 
were 
backed by a change in the views of the court. In the midst of 
the pro-patent current, a transformation occurred in the U.S. 
judicial branch. 
  Among other things, pro-patent judges were appointed to the 
Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, which, as mentioned earlier, 
was established in 1982, and since the 1980's, the pro-patent 
line has taken root. 
  What became especially noticeable is the skyrocketing value 
of intellectual property; huge amounts are being awarded in 
damages for patent violations. 
  The biggest reason is a change in the method used to 
calculate damage awards for patent infringements. The method 
used before, a formula based on market values in the industry, 
was replaced by another method, which is based on fictitious or 
"supposed negotiations." In the "industry market value method," 
damage awards were computed by taking into account market values 
(values current at the time of the signing of a licensing 
contract) in whatever industry (automobile, semiconductor or toy 
industry, for example) that was relevant to the patent case. 
According to this standard, license fees could be as little as 
1 percent of market value or, as was usually the case, 
somewhere between 2 and 5 percent. 
  The criterion now used to decide the size of damage awards 
follows this line of thought: "Hypothetically, if the patent 
holder and the party who wants to buy a license from him were to 
negotiate in good faith, how much would the fee for such a 
license be?" 
  Compared to the "industry market value formula," which tends 
to ignore the value of a specific invention, this criterion, 
when used in determining the amount of damage awards, takes into 
account the value in use, or usefulness, of the invention 
itself. If the product, which was made on the basis of the 
discovery, yields a high profit ratio, then, naturally, a high 
licensing fee can be demanded and this, of course, means a high 
damage award. 
  In fact, it is not unusual for U.S. courts to decide on 
licensing fees as high as 15 or 25 percent of sales value and, 
in at least one court decision, a licensing fee of 30 percent 
was even recognized. 
  The second reason for the high value that intellectual 
property demands is found in the system of triple damages 
awards. In fact, in Sega's case, the company faced the threat of 
having to pay three times the amount of actual damages incurred. 
This system of triple damages awards is uniquely American and 
has a punitive aspect to it. In U.S. patent law, when the court 
finds a deliberate infringement has taken place, the injured 
party (that is, the patent holder) can demand as much as three 
times the amount of actual damages. Whether triple actual 
damages is in fact awarded is left to the discretion of the 
presiding judge. In Sega's case, the jury recognized the 
infringement as being "deliberate," so there was a possibility 
that this threefold rule might be applied. Sega ended up 
settling out of court before the judge ruled on the final 
amount, but with this triple indemnity hanging over its head, 
Sega would seem to have been handicapped while negotiating an 
"amicable" settlement. 
  Third, even when, as in Minolta's case, the infringement 
involved only one part of the camera, the autofocus mechanism, 
the basis for computing the licensing fee is the sales price of 
the entire camera. In other words, when the courts recognize an 
infringement for a part, damages are calculated on the basis of 
the entire finished product. 
  Naturally, with this method, when the sales price of the 
finished product is high, the amount of the damage award is high. 
  There is one additional reason for the high price of 
intellectual property in the United States--the U.S. jury 
system. No matter what, juries tend to decide in favor of the 
small inventor over the large corporation and in favor of U.S. 
enterprises over foreign enterprises. This tends to put Japanese 
companies at a disadvantage. Not used to the jury system, 
Japanese companies, in many cases, have also not adequately 
prepared their defense strategy. 
  Moreover, in determining damage awards, juries have broad 
discretionary powers and are said to have a tendency to grant 
large awards. 
<H5>  Learn From Japan's Successful Court Cases </H5>
  There are cases where a Japanese litigant, having been 
accused of patent infringement, goes to court and wins, and such 
cases should serve as useful references. 
  In the case of Refac Technology Development Co. versus 
Hitachi Ltd., Refac claimed to hold three patents for liquid 
crystal display (LCD) technology and sued 108 companies, 
including licensees, for patent infringements. 
  Objecting on the grounds of legal procedure, Hitachi claimed 
that Refac had failed to conduct an adequate inquiry prior to 
filing the suit. In April 1992, the Federal District Court in 
California not only ruled again Refac, it ordered the company to 
pay $1.5 million, including the defendant's legal costs. 
  Without letting itself be swayed into an out-of-court 
settlement, Hitachi succeeded in cleverly piercing the other 
party's Achilles heel. 
  Another company that fought its case successfully, this time 
before a jury, is Izumi Precision Industries Co., headquartered 
in Matsumoto City in Nagano Prefecture. In 1986, the company won 
a patent infringement case brought against it by Philips of the 
United States for violating the latter's patent for an electric 
shaver. 
  The company, which has about 100 employees, deserves special 
mention as an example of a small enterprise beating out a large 
multinational corporation like Philips. A lot can be learned 
from the case by Japanese companies, which dislike ligitation 
and have a tendency to rush into out of court settlements. 
  Up until now, disputes and collisions over patents where 
leading edge technology has been involved have been in areas 
like the semiconductor field, music instruments, and fiber optic 
telecommunications. After this, however, the areas where it 
seems there is going to be a growing number of patent disputes 
are biotechnology and computer software. In the United States, 
technical resources have been directed into biotechnology from 
very early on, especially into the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH), which is located in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. 
  The earliest example of a patent dispute involving 
biotechnology is the suit brought against Toyobo in 1987 by a 
California company named Genentech over a medical product based 
on gene recombination technology. 
  In the area of computer software, pressure from the United 
States will probably grow over issues like Japan's use of 
illegal copies of U.S.-made software. The prologue to such 
disputes over intellectual property rights began in 1982 in a 
case involving Hitachi and IBM. Today, 10 years later, the 
issues are more pressing than ever. The United States has been 
issuing warnings about illegal software copies being used in 
Japanese offices for a long time, and the atmosphere is now all 
but ready to explode. 
  Japanese companies mustn't forget that they are doing 
business in the midst of an unprecedented pro-patent mood based 
on national strategy. In order for Japanese companies not to get 
drawn into a patent dispute with the United States, prior 
investigation to determine whether or not they might be in 
violation of an existing patent is very important. Research of 
this sort should be carried out before a company even considers 
introducing its product on the U.S. market. Companies should 
also get the opinion of an attorney regarding the results of 
their investigations. Such precautions are an added safeguard 
against being found in "deliberate" violation of a patent, a 
finding that opens the way for awards three times the amount of 
actual damage. 
  Companies must also carefully save and manage internal 
documents. Because of a peculiarly U.S. system based on a 
"first-to-discover" [rather than first-to-file] criterion in 
granting patents, if there is a lawsuit, it is important that 
companies be able to show the opposing side all documents 
relevant to the case. 
<H5>  Development of Basic Technology Is Needed </H5>
  One of the strategic measures that Japanese companies must 
take against U.S. pro-patent offensive is the development of 
basic technology. Business managers will probably see such 
research as eating into their profits and would much rather turn 
their attention to applied research, where the prospects for a 
successful outcome are much clearer than the uncertainties of 
basic research. 
  But the success of the top companies representing Japan in 
the 21st century--whether they will be up there with the best 
companies in the world--depends on how much technical resources 
managers have invested in their companies and how successful 
they have been in developing basic technologies. Without 
changing their present attitudes, they can't expect their 
companies to be world-class representatives of their respective 
industries. 
  If companies have developed a store of basic technology, 
when 
and if patent disputes do arise, this technology can be used for 
cross-licensing purposes. With the revenue from such licensing 
fees, companies can also stabilize their operations. 
  The government also has a very important role in regard to 
the development of basic technology. It is true, in certain 
respects, that such technology doesn't add to a company's profit 
line. Thus, we have to place some of our expectations on the 
universities and the country's research institutes. 
  It would be difficult for Japan to imitate the United States 
in terms of putting the latest technology into the hands of the 
private sector through its development of military technology. 
To the degree that Japan can't expect basic technologies to be 
developed through such means, as a nation, we must prepare to 
develop alternate means. 
  And to that end, there will have to be substantial increases 
in the budgets of our universities and national research 
institutes. 
  We should remind ourselves of the 1980's, when official 
development assistance (ODA) was steadily increased even though 
Japan's fiscal budget at the time was following a strict "no 
growth" line. In compliance with constitutional restrictions on 
Japan's contributing militarily to international situations, the 
government instead increased ODA funding. 
  In much the same way, as long as there are restrictions on 
the development of military technology, Japan must substantially 
increase the budgets for universities and institutions carrying 
out advanced research. It is in such a way that the development 
of advanced, basic technology capable of surpassing developments 
in Europe and the United States becomes a possibility. The 
development of this kind of technology, moveover, will not only 
contribute to Japan's technological development but also to the 
transfer of technology to developing nations. The kind of 
technological containment surrounding the United States freezes 
existing differences in technology between such countries and 
developing nations. Contributing to such differences is not the 
path that Japan should take given its national policy toward 
assisting developing nations. The U.S. National Institutes of 
Health gathers leading researchers from all over the world, 
including some 300 from Japan, and has become a mecca for 
biochemical research. Japan, too, should establish a science and 
technology center that is open to researchers in every field of 
advanced technology, inviting those not only from the United 
States and Europe but from the developing nations as well. 
  Promoting projects that can contribute to the world in this 
way can be thought of as creating a link in the global 
partnership espoused by Japan and the United States. Such 
projects will be useful on a road that leads--not to 
confrontations between Japan and the United States in what is 
expected to be intensified trade conflicts between the two 
countries over leading edge technology--but to harmony and 
cooperation. Concrete projects of this sort, based on 
discussions with the Clinton administration, should probably be 
encouraged as joint enterprises between our two countries.

  [Text] A preliminary decision has been made on the issue 
concerning the government procurement of 11 supercomputers with 
the first supplementary budget for fiscal 1993. At this point, 
the decision has been nearly made on which makers will supply 10 
supercomputers: five will be procured from domestic makers while 
the other five will be from American makers. It appears to be a 
well-balanced decision, considering the fact that the government 
procurement issue is regarded as a major sector at the 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. However, in addition to 
the fact that Cray Research Inc., the largest U.S. maker, has 
been asking for revamping of the procurement procedures, 
Japanese research institutes that will purchase these 
supercomputers have voiced their dissatisfaction with the stiff 
attitude of the United States. Since it is believed that 
another five or more computers will be procured in the next 
fiscal year, this decision may arouse future problems. 
  With the original budget for fiscal 1993, the government has 
procured four computers: two from NEC and one each from Hitachi 
Ltd. and Fujitsu. Then, in the bidding for procurement with the 
supplementary budget, what was noteworthy was the bidding of a 
"Japan-U.S. alliance," with Japanese companies providing 
American supercomputers. This alliance came into being because 
many research institutes asked for parallel-processing 
computers, which are equipped with a large number of 
microprocessing units (MPU) that are capable of data processing. 
  So far, in the bidding for the so-called "vector-type" 
conventional supercomputers, the competition was limited to four 
companies: Cray, Fujitsu, NEC, and Hitachi. However, in the 
bidding for parallel-type computers, Intel Corp. of the United 
States, the largest maker of MPUs used for personal computers, 
and another U.S. maker, Thinking Machines [name as published], 
have also strengthened their competitive power. And those 
Japanese makers or system designers that do not possess their 
own powerful products have one after another started to rely on 
U.S. products. Thus, it has been voiced in the computer 
industry that "Japan-U.S. friction can no longer be regarded as 
a simple issue." 
  On 28 January, the Science and Technology Agency and the 
Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Cooperation will 
decide on which maker they provide the 10th supercomputer that 
will be purchased with the supplementary budget funds. However, 
it is expected that the lone bidder, Cray, will get the order 
without any competition after the checking of its price and 
technological specifications. Moreover, when the Ministry of 
Health and Welfare's National Cancer Center holds its bidding 
for the last supercomputer in February, it is believed that the 
bidding will be favorable to American makers. 
  However, Cray will certainly be dissatisfied with the 
results 
because it will end up winning orders for only two computers 
despite its objective of four or five. Cray's failure was 
caused by Fujitsu's "overwhelming" success in winning orders for 
four units. In its competition with Cray, Fujitsu gained high 
marks in its products' performance. Moreover, its price was 
lower by a large margin. In this connection, other companies, 
such as NEC and Hitachi, are determined to "make a comeback in 
the next fiscal year." 
  Kazuyoshi Hori, president of Cray Research in Japan, 
maintained: "Under the current system of checking technological 
features, examiners generally swallow all the data supplied by 
makers. A third-party organ should be set up for conducting 
more strict examinations." He also suggested: "To put a brake 
on the price war, there should be a minimum price in the 
bidding." He also pointed out that if the price should fall far 
below the fund set aside in the budget, it will virtually become 
the criteria in working out the budget for the next procurement, 
and "this will bring about trouble for concerned research 
institutes." 
  Concerning this opinion, some research institute sources 
have stated: "Generally speaking, what he has pointed out makes 
good sense." However, when it comes to concrete measures, many 
have said: "How will the minimum price be decided? Moreover, 
makers' efforts to cut costs should not be ignored." 
Furthermore, they have long been dissatisfied with the fact 
that aside from issues connected with research work, priority 
has to be given to such problems as the Japan-U.S. friction. 
Reportedly, U.S. officials paid visits, under the pretext of 
hearings, to every Japanese research institution on separate 
occasions before the biddings. There is also a growing 
opposition to such a practice.

  [Text] The Tokyo Electric Power Co. [TEPC], the Kansai 
Electric Power Co. [KEPC], and other power companies will 
decrease the "tokumei hatchu" [special designation ordering] 
system and increase opportunities for adopting a competitive 
bidding system. Under the "tokumei hatchu" system, an electric 
company asks only one company to make an estimate for procuring 
materials or ordering works. Various electric companies intend 
to increase the ratio of using competitive bidding to 50 percent 
from the current 30-40 percent. They have decided to do so to 
deal with growing demands from foreign countries that 
transparency be promoted in biddings for public works and 
government procurement of materials. By promoting competition 
in ordering works, electric power companies also intend to try 
to reduce costs and control electric charges. Most of plant and 
equipment investment by the electric power industry -- which 
accounts for nearly 10 percent of the private sector's plant and 
equipment investment, or 5 trillion yen annually -- will be a 
subject for the current review of the ordering system. For this 
reason, it is likely that this will widely affect such 
industries as the electric equipment and construction industries. 
  Electric power companies have adopted two methods of 
procuring materials: the "tokumei hatchu" and the designated 
competitive bidding systems. Under the latter system, several 
companies, which attain a certain level of technology and 
quality control abilities, compete in the electric power 
industry's procurement of materials. Since the ratio of 
competitive biddings is small, people both inside and outside 
the electric power industry have begun to express the following 
critical views: "Companies which employ those who once worked 
at electric power companies are being favorably treated" and 
"the ground for selecting designated companies lacks 
transparency." 
  TEPC intends to begin reviewing the ordering system and 
increase the ratio of adopting competitive bidding to 50 percent 
during fiscal year 1994. KEPC also intends to attain the 
50-percent target by the end of the next fiscal year. The 
Hokkaido Electric Power Co., Inc. will try to increase the 
competitive bidding ratio to 50 percent from the current 30 
percent as soon as possible. Chubu Electric Power Co. [CEPC] is 
expected to attain the 50-percent target by the end of fiscal 
year 1993. 
  Because some materials related to electric power plants are 
jointly developed by electric power companies and makers and 
highly advanced technology is necessary to develop such 
materials, "it is difficult to drastically increase the 
percentage of the designated competitive bidding system to 
largely exceed 50 percent (as stated by CEPC). However, 
electric power companies have judged that it is possible to 
adopt the designated competitive bidding system in procuring 
power-transmission wires, pylons, general power transformers and 
distributors, communications equipment for business contacts, 
and other materials. 
  Meanwhile, with regard to ordering works, KEPC has begun 
studying an idea of introducing the general designated 
competitive bidding system, which does not limit companies from 
bidding. As far as KEPC is concerned, the designated 
competitive bidding presently accounts for 60 percent of its 
orders for works and the "tokumei hatchu" system accounts for 40 
percent. Because strict qualifications are necessary for 
receiving electric power-related works, the company, at first, 
intends to introduce the general competitive bidding system to 
ordinary engineering and construction works.

<F P=106> [Article by Kazuaki Kajiwara, commentator: "Hiraiwa Stands </F>
Firm Against Involvement in Political Contributions"] 
  [Text] Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of Keidanren [Federation of 
Economic Organizations] normally behaves like a used-book store 
proprietor. Tokyo Electric Power Co. honorary chairman Hiraiwa's 
office desk is cluttered with huge stacks of books that appear 
about to topple down. 
  Ranging from Shonen Jumpu (a book for boys) to 
books on pure literature, philosophy, and economics, his scope 
of reading may be considered "eclectic." He is a rare well-read 
person. 
  He is usually extremely courteous. For example, he responds 
to a question with a query: "I believe thus and thus... but what 
do you think?" He is apparently uneasy about confrontations. 
  However, his true sentiments are quite strong. He is able to 
name the successive professional boxing champions of each class 
in Japan wihout hesitation. 
  He is a great fan of such hand-to-hand combat sports as 
sumo, boxing, and Western wrestling. 
  He regularly played the shortstop position on the baseball 
team at the former Nagoya High School. His front teeth were 
knocked out by a fierce grounder that rebounded with a hop, and 
he continued to play in the game despite a mouthful of blood. 
Such brave exploits are not very well known. Despite his small 
stature, he participated in swimming, horsemanship, kendo 
[fencing], baseball, and tennis. 
  "Golf is like walking, so I do not consider it a sport." A 
typical example of a person who is gentle in appearance but 
sturdy in spirit, Hiraiwa displays rare determination and 
"self-assertiveness." 
  Recently, at the Keidanren meeting of the chairman and the 
vice chairmen on 2 September [1993], he advocated the "abolition 
of mediation by the Keidanren regarding political 
contributions." Among the dozen vice chairmen, three strongly 
opposed Hiraiwa's proposal to abolish mediation. 
  The usual Hiraiwa would give in, to no one's surprise, but 
he did not retreat a step concerning the abolition of mediation 
in political contributions and he pushed forward toward a 
"decision." 
  Regarding the political, financial, bureaucratic cozy 
alliance structure, the source is of course the political 
contributions by the financial circles and companies. In other 
words, the politicians of the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] are 
weak-kneed in front of the financial circles from whom they 
receive contributions. The financial circles are weak-kneed 
before the bureaucrats from whom they receive permits and 
licenses. The bureaucrats are weak-kneed before the politicians 
in connection with personnel authority and budgets. 
  This "three-way struggle" is considered to constitute 
Japan's power structure and is called the 1955 system. In fact, 
more than 20 years have passed since this political, financial, 
and bureaucratic triangle began to be distorted from an 
equilateral triangle. 
  First, the power of the financial circles began to weaken. 
Then the LDP began to squeak and became fractured. Next, with 
deregulation and the difficulty of obtaining appointments to the 
private sector for retired government officials, an era of 
ordeal will soon come for upper-bracket bureaucrats. 
  The political, financial, bureaucratic equilateral triangle 
structure rarely seen in the world has definitely wrought a 
miraculous economic prosperity. The true identity of "Japan 
Inc." could be said to be the political, financial, bureaucratic 
joint corporation. 
  The change in the industrial structure is a major factor for 
the decline in this section of financial power. 
  What would happen if the growth of such industries and 
enterprises as autos and distribution that deal with the masses 
surpasses the growth of such industries and enterprises as 
electric power and steel on which permits and licensing and 
administrative guidance have considerable impact? 
  The interests within the so-called total capital clash. The 
monolithic financial era has long since passed. 
  In other words, the long-term decline of the financial 
circles began more than 20 years before. It can be rephrased as 
the power decline of Keidanren, which is the central 
organization of the financial world. Comparing the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] with Keidanren is based on the 
fact that both are in a long-term decline. 
  There was once an era when the Keidanren chairman was called 
Japan's "shadow prime minister." However, one could never call 
Gaishi Hiraiwa--the seventh chairman--a "shadow prime minister," 
even in flattery. 
  The Keidanren method of allocating political contributions 
to the various enterprises and distributing them to the LDP and 
DSP [Democratic Socialist Party] en bloc is considered to be 
extremely clean. However, Hiraiwa says that the national 
sentiment will not tolerate even that. He means that political 
contributions in the future should be left up to the companies 
to do as they wish. 
  To whom is Chairman Hiraiwa's "unusual firmness" directed?

<F P=106> [Article by Toichi Suzuki, political commentator: "LDP </F>
Suffers From Dwindling Political Funds With the Keidanren's 
Hiraiwa Drawn Into the Ozawa Strategy"] 
  [Text] Steamroller Breakthrough by Chairman Hiraiwa 
  It has been more than 20 days since Keidanren--the central 
organization of the financial circles--set forth its direction 
of abolishing arranged political contributions and abolishing 
corporate donations beginning in 1994. While receiving a major 
shock, the LDP is desperately attempting to keep the changes to 
a minimum. Meanwhile, the coalition government parties are 
poised to attack the LDP en masse regarding the funds aspect, 
and an uproar is spreading throughout Nagata-cho. 
  On 2 September [1993] following a conference of the 
Keidanren 
chairman and vice chairmen, Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa stated at a 
press conference, "There was a strong view that corporate 
donations per se are not bad. However, the political 
circumstances have changed, and there is strong criticism by 
public opinion. Therefore, the Keidanren has decided to halt 
mediation to respond to the new era, and has set forth a 
direction of abolishing corporate donations." 
  Also, General Secretary Miyoshi pointed out that "among the 
12 vice chairmen, three opposed Mr. Hiraiwa's proposal 
(abolition of mediation)." 
  However, the Miyoshi statement was a false statement, akin 
to 
an announcement by the Imperial Staff Headquarters [during World 
War II]. One of those present says: "Three, including Vice 
Chairman Katsuhiro Utada and Vice Chairman Isao Nakauchi, were 
in clear agreement with Mr. Hiraiwa, but nine either disagreed 
or expressed caution. Mister Hiraiwa was apparently determined 
to submit his resignation if his will was not accepted, and it 
ended as a railroaded breakthrough. A decision despite 
overwhelming opposition was unprecedented since Keidanren's 
inception." 
  The Keidanren system of engaging in the accumulation of 
funds 
and distribution procedures--created after self-reflection over 
the shipbuilding scandals and lasting for 40 years--has come to 
an end. It is the result of Chairman Hiraiwa's judgment and 
determination. 
  Even Hiraiwa himself was badly shaken. On 18 June [1993] at 
a 
press conference immediately after the dissolution, he stated as 
follows. "The LDP has splintered. However, we will continue our 
supportive posture regarding funds for the LDP. We are not 
considering the New Party for the time being." 
  The financial circles responded with strong opposition. The 
political donations had been the realm of the Keidanren's 
exclusive authority, and the other economic organizations 
normally had no say in the matter, but the leaders are 
overpowered by the underlings in a turbulent era. Chairman Ken 
Nagano of the Nikkeiren [Japan Federationof Employers' 
Associations] said: "Political donations should be distributed 
to the conservative parties commensurate with their respective 
numbers of Diet seats." 
  Furthermore, the following views continue to surface. "The 
Keidanren acts smart by doling out the money. Our views should 
be included concerning money allocation." "Donations should not 
be limited to the LDP, and neutrality should be observed. 
Corporate donations should eventually be abolished with 
political reform, and should be replaced by public assistance 
and individual donations." 
  A contrasting view is offered as follows. "Chairman Nagano 
of 
the Nikkeiren and representative manager Hayami of Keizai 
Doyukai [Japan Association of Corporate Executives] have a 
common awareness of having cooperated with the coalition 
government. Consequently, they criticize the LDP severely." 
  Moreover, general trading companies like Marubeni-Iida and 
Sumitomo Corporation have proposed "freezing political 
donations," while the Department Stores Association has also 
decided to abolish donations. Chairman Hiraiwa anguished during 
the concentrated barrage of criticism from the leaders of the 
various organizations, and his posture changed on 1 August as 
follows. "We might as well take the lead in political reform. 
The Keidanren would like to stop distributing political 
donations." 
  Also, when an opinion was expressed at a conference of four 
organizations, including the Keidanren and the Nikkeiren, that 
"distributions should be made according to the number of Diet 
seats including other parties besides the LDP on a sliding 
scale," Chairman Hiraiwa stated: "We will not stoop to such a 
stupid act as if we were distributing baked dumplings." 
  The Keidanren thus decided to completely abolish 
fund-raising 
duties. 
<H5>  Doko-Kikawada-Hiraiwa Geneology </H5>
  This is not the first time that the Keidanren quit 
collecting 
funds. In 1974 Chairman Toshio Doko called (the then) managing 
director, Jinpachiro Hanamura, and told him: "The Keidanren will 
withdraw from handling political contributions. We cannot permit 
any further mediation." Hanamura resisted vehemently, and Shigeo 
Nagano called Doko a fool, which threw the financial circles 
into an uproar. At the time, it was the Tokyo Electric Power 
chairman, Kazutaka Kikawada (Keizai Doyukai representative 
manager), who fully backed Doko. 
  It was an era of Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka's theory on 
the 
reconstruction of the Japanese Islands and runaway commodity 
prices. There was a movement against payment of power rates, 
and Fusae Ichikawa (Dietwoman) contended: "The power companies 
are making political contributions on the one hand and raising 
electric fees on the other. We cannot permit this." 
  This contention hit a sore point of the power companies, and 
Kikawada conceded by declaring: "In the future, the Tokyo 
Electric Power Co. will stop political donations completely." 
  The Kyushu Electric Power Co. followed suit, and the 
electric 
power industry has subsequently refrained from contributions 
under the Keidanren system. The Keidanren statement that 
"although the LDP may be demolished, we cannot destroy Tokyo 
Electric Power for the sake of the people's livelihood" remains 
effective. 
  Hiraiwa was Kikawada's favorite disciple and executive 
director in charge of general affairs at the time. 
  Why did Doko decide to abolish fund-raising activities? 
During the 1953 shipbuilding scandals, Doko who was president of 
Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries gave a donation to 
Secretary General Eisaku Sato through President Kensuke Matano 
of the Iino Kaiun Kaisha in order to receive loans from the 
Japan Export-Import Bank and the Japan Development Bank. Doko 
was also arrested due to President Matano's confession and was 
jailed for about 20 days. Although he was released without an 
indictment, Doko reportedly achieved the following conviction 
because of this experience. "I will absolutely not associate 
with politicians in the future. Political donations are evil." 
  In the summer of 1974 upper house elections, Prime Minister 
Tanaka, feared a reversal of power between the conservatives and 
reformists, and he demanded 20 billion yen in contributions from 
the financial circles. At the time, the annual donations 
amounted to about 5 billion yen, so the financial circles were 
petrified by the demand. "This is terrible. Political donations 
have been raised by one digit." 
  Chairman Doko, the "rough priest," reacted strongly against 
the money-power politics with a halt to fund-raising that lasted 
for about a year. This became a factor for the collapse of the 
Tanaka cabinet. 
<H5>  Close Relationship Between Hiraiwa and Ozawa </H5>
  Keidanren Chairman Hiraiwa thus follows the personnel link 
between Doko and Kikawada, and he inherits their temperament 
considerably. 
  Takeshi Sakurada, president of Nisshinbo Industries and 
formerly one of the "Big Four" in the financial circles, once 
evaluated Kikawada as follows. "A president who is unable to 
decide the prices of products made at his own company is not a 
manager." 
  Power rates are decided by MITI [Ministry of International 
Tradeand Industry]. The criticism meant that such a company 
president could not be recognized as a manager. Hiraiwa 
inherited Tokyo Electric Power from Kikawada and, in Sakurada's 
words, is not a manager, but still serves as Keidanren chairman. 
An elder of the financial circles says: "Both Kikawada and 
Hiraiwa stand outside the economic movements and their thinking 
is mainly theoretical or conceptual." 
  Hiraiwa has served as chairman of Ichiro Ozawa's support 
association for many years and is reported to be closely 
associated with him. 
  A reporter, who covers the financial world, says: "Hiraiwa 
believes in Ozawa. Although he questions Ozawa's political 
methods, I have heard him highly evaluate Ozawa's great ability 
to formulate ideas, his decisiveness, and his power of 
execution." Hiraiwa also states: "The LDP splintering is a 
history inevitability. They must converge into two major 
parties." 
  It sounds like he is parroting Ozawa's theory. During the 
general election four years earlier, Ozawa as the LDP secretary 
general demanded and forcibly received 30 billion yen from the 
financial circles. The financial reporter continues: "At the 
time, the Keidanren distributed 12-13 billion yen annually. 
Ozawa considered that as insufficient. He negotiated directly 
with the four major industries of autos, electrical machinery 
and electronics, finance, and construction for quota donations 
and secured their promises. Chairman Eishiro Saito went over his 
head to protest, but was rejected." It was probably possible 
because it was during the bubble when the economy was 
smooth-sailing. 
  An LDP executive complains: "About 4.5 billion yen remains 
unpaid from the loans received from the city banks with special 
donations as the collateral at the time. Ozawa and his followers 
left the party, and only the debts remain. It was horrific, 
given his repayment plan on the scale of 280 member in the Lower 
House." 
  An expert on the financial world says: "Hiraiwa and Ozawa 
frequently got together. Ozawa told Hiraiwa that he wanted a 
halt to donations made solely to the LDP, and to stop 
contributions if they cannot also be made to the other parties. 
Hiraiwa had apparently heard about the 60 billion yen in public 
subsidies from Ozawa quite early beforehand." 
  In mid-September, Hiraiwa spoke to his close associates as 
follows. "In view of the fierce upheaval in politics, the 
political donations system cannot continue to operate in the 
1955 form. While I am chairman, I will not commit myself to such 
a shameful act as resuming the handling of donations." 
  Until now, while the Keidanren was in charge of fund 
allocations, sufficient funds were accumulated despite lower 
yields due to the recession. An LDP member in charge of finance 
says: "Last year, there was 25.5 billion yen in revenues. 12 
billion yen was received from the Keidanren via the People's 
Political Association. Party costs totaled 5.7 billion yen, 
party supporter costs added up to 2 billion yen, and business 
revenues from newspapers and ads totaled 4 billion yen. 16 
billion yen was requested from the Keidanren, but real revenues 
came to 12 billion yen because of the recession. 
  What will happen next year when the Keidanren's mediation 
will no longer be available? A veteran reporter observes, "Even 
if the Keidanren stops mediation, General Secretary Mori 
estimates that 70-80 percent of past revenues can be secured 
through organizations and companies. However, there is the 
recession on the one hand and the stockholders' representative 
litigation system on the other. The regional financial circles 
will probably begrudge donations when even the Keidanren has 
quit mediation. The LDP will be decisively damaged. Its 
fund-raising ability will probably be halved, or even drop to 
one-third." 
  The veteran reporter adds: "The LDP was badly shaken because 
Hiraiwa was drawn into the Ozawa strategy. The fact that Hiraiwa 
was appointed chairman of the prime minister's advisory organ to 
write a new Maekawa report may be seen as an honorary reward." 
<H5>  Direction Toward Abolition of Corporate Contributions </H5>
  The first step toward abolition of corporate donations is 
included in the coalition government's political reform bill 
submitted to the National Diet. It is labeled "the abolition of 
corporate donations to individual politicians." 
  Hajime Ishii, an executive of Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party) and chairman of the lower house political reform special 
committee, points out as follows. "If corporate donations to 
individuals disappear, the politician has no recourse than to 
receive funds from his party. If he thinks about secret money, 
the strict implication system will preclude that. Is awareness 
of this not lenient toward the LDP? The structure of political 
funds will change fundamentally. Yet, they talk about public 
subsidies of 30 billion yen, hoping it to be accepted by public 
opinion. They should agree to the government proposal of 41.4 
billion yen." 
  Representative Manager Hiroyuki Sonoda of Sakigake 
[Harbinger] says, "Sakigake has contended that corporate 
donations to individuals should be recognized. Of course, it 
should be limited to 10,000 yen monthly. However, because the 
stipulation to `move toward abolition of corporate donations' 
was used as a loyalty test when forming the coalition 
government, we have decided on abolition." 
  What happened to the tax exemption advocated by 
Representative Masayoshi Takemura (chief cabinet secretary) of 
Sakigake? Takemure stated at the time as follows. "It is 
advisable to recognize a donation to the specific party of one's 
desire with a limit of 1 percent of the submitted tax amount." 
  Such a system is practiced in the United States, but the 
Ministry of Finance did not even consider it. The next proposal 
submitted was "to exempt 100 percent of the tax amount as an 
inducement toward individual contributions. "By giving political 
donations, taxes would be fully exempt and the individual tax 
burden would be zero. The Finance Ministry showed indifference 
toward this also. After a tug-of-war debate, the government 
proposal resulted in a 30-percent exemption. The system 
stipulates that "if an individual makes a political donation of 
1 million yen, 300,000 yen will be returned." 
  Despite such attempts to increase individual contributions, 
swift progress is inconceivable. Hiroyuki Sonoda's outlook is as 
follows. "When the recession and public criticism of corporate 
donations are considered, a rise in the weight of public 
subsidies is inevitable."

  [Text] On 24 January, the leaders of four major Japanese 
economic organizations urged ruling coalition and opposition 
parties to work out a compromise to break their deadlock over 
the political reform bills which have triggered both a sharp 
drop in stock values and a weakening of the yen. This situation 
prompted the business leaders to take action. 
  At a regularly-scheduled news conference held the same day, 
Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic 
Organizations of Japan [Keidanren], said: "Political uncertainty 
and economic effects have shown up in stock values, and Japanese 
instability in the eyes of the international community has 
appeared as yen depreciation. We are at an important turning 
point not only from the domestic standpoint, but also from the 
international standpoint." Hiraiwa then urged that the 
political reform bills be enacted, saying: "Politicians should 
take a broad perspective to try to bring about political 
reform." He also stated: "The outlook on the economic situation 
could further worsen. We ask that politicians handle 
pump-priming measures along with political reform." 
  In his statements announced in the form of an informal talk, 
Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers' 
Associations [Nikkeiren], said: "There is a growing sense of 
disappointment concerning the outlook on the political reform 
bills which we have asserted would have had the greatest 
favorable impact above all else toward economic recovery. For 
those politicians who fail to calmly analyze the grave impact of 
the current situation and exercise common sense, their 
responsibility is extremely serious. If the political reform 
bills cannot be enacted during the current Diet session, the 
very foundations of the Japanese economy could crack open." He 
thus expressed his concern about the current situation. 
  Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of 
Corporate 
Executives [Keizai Doyukai], stated: "Since there was such great 
hope in the passage of the political reform bills, we are 
concerned that (business and consumer) sentiments may cool down 
in reaction to the rejection of the bills. Both ruling 
coalition and opposition parties should disregard party 
interests and strategies and pour their utmost efforts to 
prevent the bills from being killed by seeking a compromise." 
  Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry [Nissho], asserted: "Ruling coalition and opposition 
parties should disregard what has occurred between them in the 
past regarding political reform, tax system reform, and budget 
compilation. They should then discuss and determine what should 
be given priority in the interest of the people and promptly 
take necessary action."

"Formidable Chief of Staff Takemura's Shrewd Strategy To Protect 
the `Premier' With Sakigake Members Appointed to the Prime 
Minister's Official Residence"] 
  [Text] The Prime Minister's Official Residence is currently 
managed by [Masayoshi] Takemura, chief cabinet secretary and 
president of Sakigake [Harbinger]. Takemura and Prime Minister 
Hosokawa have worked closely since they served as governors and 
can now be considered as being on a honeymoon. Takemura is an 
indispensable member of the Hosokawa administration. However, it 
is said that his relations have soured with Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] Secretary General Ozawa, a key backstage player 
in the coalition government. As the political world approaches a 
second restructuring, Mr. Takemura must be watched closely. 
<H3>  New Nagata-cho Triangle Consisting of Hosokawa, Ozawa, and 
Takemura </H3>
  Some quarters equate the non-Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] 
coalition government as the "eight-headed reptile of Japan." 
They must be referring to the eight leaders of the seven parties 
and one group comprising the coalition. 
  However, the eight-headed reptile itself is aware that it 
possesses only one torso and that if the eight completely 
differing leaders opt to act in accordance with their own ideas, 
the torso of the reptile will split into eight separate pieces. 
  That is the very reason why every effort is made to avoid 
such a situation. The only reason why the Hosokawa government 
has survived for three months despite it being called fragile as 
glass is that the respective parties making up the coalition 
government earnestly restrain themselves against over-asserting 
their positions in the execution of the coalition government's 
policies. 
  However, notwithstanding such a stance, no progress 
whatsoever can be made unless someone serves as the policy 
administrator and power center for the government. The 
individuals who have assumed that role comprise the "trio" of 
Morihiro Hosokawa and Masayoshi Takemura, presidents of the 
Japan New Party [JNP] and Sakigake, respectively, and Ichiro 
Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito, all of whom were former 
members of the LDP. 
  It is noteworthy that Prime Minister Hosokawa and Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Takemura are now on a honeymoon. According to 
a Sakigake official, the two were on intimate terms during their 
days as governors and are "close to being eternal friends." In 
terms of the composition of the government, Takemura has assumed 
the role of right-hand man and chief cabinet secretary, but 
understands that he is basically a sworn friend of Hosokawa. 
Thus, there are occasions when Takemura makes a decision for the 
government and Hosokawa follows up on the situation with his 
approval. 
  However, cracks have begun to appear in the honeymoon 
relationship between Hosokawa-Takemura and Ozawa, who plays a 
backstage role. One feels that the vulnerability of the 
coalition government in the absence of a true leader or 
commander-in-chief, in a benign sense, is beginning to gradually 
expose itself at this point. 
  As an example, Takemura and Ozawa clashed head-on in their 
assertions during the compilation of the government's draft of 
the political reform law which constitutes the Hosokawa 
government's leading critical issue. Concerning the balloting 
method for the combined proportional representation electoral 
district system, Takemura and his Sakigake, which favors a 
moderate multiparty system, advocate a two-vote coded system and 
during a public television program, Takemura spontaneously 
expressed his true feelings by saying, "If I were to have a 
choice, I would prefer a two-vote system." 
  However, that statement upset Ozawa in that he is of the 
feeling that, "We have no choice but to adopt the one-vote 
system if we are going to realize a two-major-party system." 
  Ozawa promptly summoned Takemura to a meeting of the leaders 
of the various political parties which the former veritably 
controls and admonished the latter severely by stating, "It was 
truly imprudent of you as the chief cabinet secretary to 
publicly speak in favor of a two-vote system when we haven't 
even decided on a government position!" Secretary Ichikawa of 
Komeito, who is a sworn ally of Ozawa and who was attending the 
meeting, fired an endorsing volley by adding, "Mr. Takemura 
should gracefully apologize." At that moment, it seemed as if 
Takemura had been completely crushed by the Shinseito-Komeito 
alliance. 
  However, when Takemura returned to the Prime Minister's 
Residence, he displayed his anger by saying, "It is only natural 
that a variety of views are expressed during the development of 
important policies. My statements on television were expressions 
of views made as head of Sakigake." 
  And, he is said to have mumbled, "If this sort of situation 
persists, Ozawa and I just might part ways eventually." That 
episode marks the beginning of the Takemura-Ozawa war. 
  This just might be a case where the seniority system concept 
of the LDP era reared its ugly head in Ozawa's mind, wherein he 
feels, "I may be junior in age to Takemura but I am now a 
veteran Diet man reelected for a ninth term in the House of 
Representatives. As a three-term Diet man, Takemura has no right 
to speak that way." 
  However, even if Takemura were classified as a three-term 
Diet man, he is nonetheless undeniably one of the "eight heads 
of the Japanese reptile," and we should interpret this situation 
not as an emotional confrontation between two individuals, but a 
confrontation of political concepts of Shinseito and Sakigake. 
<H3>  Takemura Outmaneuvered by Ozawa on the "Prime Minister 
Hosokawa" Concept </H3>
  It is said that Takemura did not favor a coalition 
government 
as it exists today. 
  It is said that Takemura had favored a "nationwide unified 
coalition cabinet," excluding the Communist Party, lead by 
former Minister of Justice Masaharu Gotoda who had served as 
examining officer when Takemura was hired by the Ministry of 
Home Affairs, if a coalition was to be formed, and that Hosokawa 
had also concurred in such an approach. Reputedly, the 
horizontal ties of bureaucrats who previously served with the 
Ministry of Home Affairs are very strong. There was one more 
factor that influenced Takemura's ideas. When he was a member of 
the LDP, he served as chief of the administrative bureau of the 
Political Reform Headquarters when Gotoda served as its acting 
chief, and he also embraces political ideas in common with those 
of Gotoda. 
  Takemura mobilized the assistance of Hiroshi Mitsuzuka who 
once led his own faction and currently serves as LDP Political 
Reform Headquarters chief and junior members of that former 
faction and attempted to "talk Gotoda into the idea of becoming 
the coalition leader," but Gotoda would not agree for fear of 
his unstable health. 
  As soon as an overwhelming victory by the non-LDP camp 
became 
evident after the general election of 18 July, a movement gained 
momentum and it appeared a consensus had been formed among the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], Shinseito, Komeito, the 
Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and the United Social 
Democratic Party to support President Tsutomu Hata (currently 
deputy prime minister and foreign minister) of Shinseito to lead 
the new government. However, unexpectedly stubborn reaction 
arose against Shinseito Secretary General Ozawa on the part of 
the Japan New Party and Sakigake, and it created a situation in 
which it would be impossible to unify the non-LDP forces under a 
"Hata government." 
  At that time, this writer spoke with several officials of 
the 
two parties and found that sentiment against Ozawa was 
unexpectedly stubborn and one of them even said, "We should not 
become a part of the government even if it is born as either an 
LDP or non-LDP government." 
  Takemura himself once made his cautious stance toward Mr. 
Ozawa obvious when during a television interview, he said, "I 
like Mr. Hata, but Mr. Ozawa... I don't dislike." 
  Ozawa, who sensed a crisis, met secretly deep into the night 
with Hosokawa in a Tokyo hotel four days after the election on 
the 22d and strongly urged the latter to accept nomination as 
leader of the coalition. 
  Ozawa is quoted as saying, "Our idea is to make you prime 
minister. If you would accept the nomination, a non-LDP 
government will be created for the first time in 38 years. Among 
members of the SDPJ and DSP are some who oppose a Hosokawa 
leadership, but this is an issue that I will resolve 
responsibly." 
  Hosokawa sharply intensified his non-LDP stance following 
this discussion. An official of the Japan New Party commented, 
"The JNP president, who had seemed to be preoccupied by 
something, suddenly came alive, making me promptly feel that 
something exciting took place." 
  We cannot deny the fact that the general public was very 
skeptical about the irresolute attitude taken by the Japan New 
Party and Sakigake which preferred venturing over a third 
course, just when "non-LDP" was developing into a key word 
following the general election. 
  It may have been only logical that Hosokawa gave Ozawa an 
affirmative reply in view of the needs posed by the times, but 
according to an official of Sakigake, Takemura must have felt 
extremely chagrined at the fact that he was "brilliantly 
outmaneuvered by Ozawa." 
  However, Takemura proved he was quick at altering his 
stance, 
proving his mettle as a former bureaucrat. As soon as a policy 
consensus was formed among the seven non-LDP parties and one 
group, he wasted no time solidifying his position by leaking to 
the mass media that, "I have been asked by Mr. Hosokawa to be 
his chief cabinet secretary. 
  It is said that Ozawa wanted to make Takemura minister of 
home affairs or minister in charge of political reform and 
nominate his confidants Hiroshi Kumagai or Hajime Funada as 
chief cabinet secretary, but in this respect Takemura revenged 
himself with brilliance. 
  Further, Takemura embarked on a project to staff the Prime 
Minister's Residence with members of "Sakigake." 
<H3>  He Was Quick To Change Political Positions Even When He Was 
Governor </H3>
  First, the candidate for deputy chief cabinet secretary was 
changed from a nominee belonging to Shinseito to Yukio Hatoyama. 
According to a JNP official, "It had been agreed that Shusei 
Tanaka who is intimate with the prime minister would be 
appointed to a deputy chief cabinet secretary position," but it 
appears Tanaka had declined the appointment. That's when the 
opportunity arose for Hatoyama. 
  Several days after completing work on cabinet appointments, 
Hosokawa decided on a plan to adopt the U.S. special assistant 
system and appoint Tanaka to such a post. 
  According to Tanaka, "I had thought that I would rather not 
accept an appointment to the executive level this time around, 
but I decided to accept because of an urgent plea from Hosokawa 
and a recommendation from party president Takemura." 
  Thus, work was completed on the formation of a team to 
firmly 
surround Prime Minister Hosokawa in the Prime Minister's 
Residence with appointees from Sakigake. 
  It is true that Ozawa and Shinseito officials had strong 
dissatisfaction about these appointments, but midlevel Diet 
members of Shinseito have interpreted the situation as, "Since 
the Japan New Party and Sakigake do not have members besides 
Hosokawa and Takemura who are qualified to hold cabinet posts, 
it is unavoidable that they monopolize posts just below the 
cabinet level." 
  No stories have been heard about complaints being lodged by 
Ozawa because of this situation, but it appears as if he is 
quick to forgive and forget as a matter of personality. 
  Now we direct our thoughts to Takemura, who is not as well 
known as Hosokawa or Ozawa. 
  It has been only seven years since he first entered central 
government service by being first elected to the House of 
Representatives in 1986. 
  If he had remained in the LDP, he'd still be treated as a 
junior Diet man. The best position he could hope for would be 
appointment to the post of a committee chairman of the Political 
Research Council. 
  However, many of the Diet men who were elected to office 
after the Prime Minister Nakasone double elections in 1986 were 
exposed to and harbor a feeling of crisis about "Nagato-cho 
politics" plagued by a series of scandals such as Recruit, 
Kyowa, and Sagawa. 
  Takemura is not an exception, and when the Recruit scandal 
broke out, he took the initiative in forming the "Utopia Study 
Group" composed of one- and two-year Diet men and embarked on 
political reform. 
  It just so happens that when I conversed with Takemura 
during 
an interview for another magazine, he made a subtle statement 
hinting at the formation of a new party and reorganization of 
the government which I will introduce at this point. 
  "Recently, I have come to feel that confidence cannot be 
restored unless we undertake a movement to execute a bold reform 
of the political world and the LDP--priority of which comes 
first is immaterial---which the general public can intimately 
sense as having taken place or is in the process of taking 
place, because we would be taking only part of the required 
actions if measures were restricted only to election system 
reform." 
  And, in reference to the status of future political 
reorganization, he said, "During the next two to three years, as 
a minimum, we will probably see a number of movements to include 
a period in which the political world will assume two major 
flows or reorganize into two major political parties." 
  At that point at the beginning of this year, Takemura may 
have already been visualizing establishment of Sakigake, with 
the Utopia Study Group as a foundation. 
  This writer occasionally travels to Shiga Prefecture to give 
lectures, but comments by prefecture residents generally 
appraise him as being "quick to change positions." 
  When I recently visited Otsu, a taxi driver made a statement 
which could be interpreted as a joke or sarcasm saying, "His 
actions should be described as `overtaking from behind' rather 
than `serving as a harbinger.'" 
  It is said, "The wise change themselves to fit changed 
circumstances. Midgets change their masks." Just as the beauty 
of a leopard's fur is improved through shedding and renewal, 
politicians should be allowed to undergo transformation if such 
action will empower them to embark on new achievements. 
  If one asks individuals who are close to Takemura for their 
opinion of his characteristics, the reply is, "He is a 
politician whose future is ahead of him, but he is not an 
opportunist that fits the so-called orthodox definition of the 
word. Sources in Shiga Province say that when Takemura was 
governor of Shiga, he placed a "great amount of importance on 
the concerns of the prefecture's citizens and common people." 
  Such a stance cannot be appreciated without knowing 
Takemura's childhood days. 
<H5>  "Utopia Study Group" Served as Prototype for Sakigake!? </H5>
  In comparison to the fact that 40 percent of the current 
Diet 
members are second-generation Diet men, Takemura, the second son 
among six children of a poor farm family, lost his parents early 
in life and was forced to work himself up from the depths of 
poverty. 
  The influence of such a background inspired him to become an 
obsessive reader of books on subjects such as Marxist capitalism 
and Engels' communist doctrine, making him a follower of Marxism. 
  It seems that Takemura's rebellious disposition was acquired 
from those days of his early life. 
  Although he passed the senior national public service tests 
with flying colors, he chose to join the Ministry of Home 
Affairs. Even such a choice was very typical of Takemura. 
  The Ministry of Home Affairs serves as the overall 
supervisory agency for local governments, but on the other hand, 
according to a former bureau chief of the ministry, "It also 
serves as the agency that conveys the opinions of local 
governments to the central government, providing for a 
long-existing `tradition' wherein it and the central government 
are placed in a contentious situation." 
  It is probably because of such tradition that many 
politicians who were formerly employed by the Ministry of Home 
Affairs or the former Ministry of Internal Affairs possess a 
rebellious, antiestablishment characteristic, unlike most 
bureaucrats. 
  As examples, former Diet men of the Ministry of Home Affairs 
include the late Yoshimi Furui and Kokichi Nadao, and current 
Diet members formerly of the ministry include Seisuke Okuno and 
Masaharu Gotoda, while Takemura is of the same lineage. 
  However, Takemura cast aside his career as a government 
official in his seventh year with the ministry and became mayor 
of Yokaichi city, his birthplace. At that time, he was only 37 
years of age. 
  Later, Takemura became governor of Shiga Prefecture after a 
unique election campaign. In that election, Takemura negotiated 
the support of four reformist, middle-of-the-road parties--the 
SDPJ, Komeito, DSP, and USDP--(excluding the LDP) and four labor 
organizations including the General Council of Trade Unions of 
Japan [Sohyo] and Japanese Confederation of Labor [Domei]. At 
that time in 1974, it would have not been unusual for a 
reformist candidate to use that kind of support, but it was a 
first for a conservative on a nationwide basis and became the 
center of much attention. 
  Takemura virtually ran as a reformist candidate and won the 
election after defeating an LDP-recommended candidate. There is 
the proverb which says, "The child is the father of the man," 
but it may have been a case where young 40-year-old Governor 
Takemura's soul was being influenced by his readings of Marxism 
as a young boy. The posture then taken by Takemura in the form 
of a "grassroots prefectural government" emphasizing the 
interests of the citizens seems to have something in common with 
the political ideals of today's Sakigake Party. 
  Probably the main accomplishment of the three-term, 12-year 
administration of the Takemura prefectural government was the 
establishment of the 1979 Eutrophication Prevention Ordinance 
aimed at purifying the waters of Lake Biwa. That ordinance 
banned the use and sale of domestic synthetic detergents 
(discharge of phosphorous contained in detergent causes 
increases in bacteria, attendant advances in red tides, and 
eventual pollution of lake waters), provided for the control of 
factory discharges and was considered epochal for the times. The 
ordinance also provided a fine of less than 200,000 yen for 
violations of the discharge restrictions. Needless to say, 
detergent manufacturers waged a fierce battle against the 
ordinance, but Takemura succeeded in getting the ordinance 
passed with the support of consumer groups and reformist 
organizations. 
  Aside from that ordinance, Takemura engineered the 
establishment of so-called "scenic ordinances" aimed at 
protecting scenic areas. This type of ordinance is now being 
established in prefectures throughout the nation as if it were a 
logical thing to do, but the Shiga prefecture case became a 
forerunner for the nation. 
  "Environmentalist Takemura" won the strong support of 
prefectural citizens and won his second and third terms as 
governor with the support of the LDP and all other parties 
exclusive of the Communist Party unopposed. 
  It is said that Takemura pondered extensively whether he 
should run as an LDP candidate for the Diet lower house in the 
midst of his third term as governor. According to sources at the 
Shiga Prefecture government office, he applied for recognition 
as a member of the Abe faction of the LDP, although "he was 
initially planning to run as an unaligned `Prefectural Citizen 
Party' candidate." 
  Masayoshi Takemura garnered the attention of the central 
government circles because he organized the "Utopia Study Group 
with 20 members." According to Takemura, he launched a study 
group for young Diet men with the "idea of preserving utopian 
ideals in politics while advocating reform" as soon as the 
Recruit scandal surfaced in summer 1989. He alarmed the public 
by disclosing the political funds balance sheets of all members 
of the group showing that even "first-year Diet men required an 
annual average of 100 million yen in political funds." 
  When one notes that six of the 13 members of Sakigake are 
former members of this Utopia Study Group, it is not difficult 
to realize that Takemura used the council as an experiment for 
Sakigake. 
  In his jointly authored book, titled Rise of Junior 
Warriors of Nagata-cho, compiled by the Utopia Study Group, 
Takemura relates, "The aim here is to mutually cherish our 
initial aspirations to become politicians and remain pragmatic 
forever while upholding our ideals." 
<H3>  Little Politician Overcomes Big Politicians and Becomes 
"Takeo Miki" of Heisei Era </H3>
  There once was a politician named Takeo Miki (former prime 
minister), but Miki like Takemura was a politician who battled 
with authority in terms of idealism and reality and survived as 
a politician. He was a politician who would pursue idealism to 
the extreme limits, but once he sensed he could no longer 
persist in such an approach, he would not forget to reverse 
gears and quickly compromise with reality. 
  At one time, politicians ridiculed Miki as a "Balkan 
politician," but there was no denying that Miki as a small 
political force (immediately following World War II, Miki was 
president of the People's Collaboration Party, a middle- 
of-the-road party) used a technique which explored ways and 
means of overpowering major political parties and control the 
casting vote. 
  It could be that Takemura is the "Takeo Miki of the Heisei 
era." 
  As the leader of a small force of 13 and as a pragmatic 
politician with ideals, this is indeed a case of how Takemura 
will exercise his skills in forming a new political current as 
he maneuvers among strong forces such as the LDP, Shinseito, and 
Komeito. 
  Now, Takemura's political schedule, as manager of the 
coalition government, for the period after November is filled 
with a number of mentally wrenching issues. 
  Above all matters, the important issue pending now is 
political reform, but a midterm issue is the fundamental reform 
of the current tax system. 
  The list of pending issues is endless, starting with the 
review of direct and indirect taxation ratios emanating from the 
report submitted by the Tax System Research Council, measures to 
be taken to cope with the stubborn recession and income tax 
reductions and the settlement of the Uruguay Round talks by the 
end of the year. 
  Among them, an issue of supreme priority for resolution by 
yearend, in accordance with Prime Minister Hosokawa's public 
pledge, is political reform which is the raison d'etre for the 
current government. Now that an agreement has been reached with 
seven parties, in the event an agreement to the SDPJ-proposed 
amendment cannot be obtained, there is the possibility of a 
forced vote to win passage of the original draft. 
  Sources close to Takemura reveal, "We believe he will call 
for yearend dissolution of the cabinet and January elections, if 
this session of the Diet fails to produce a political reform 
measure." They are saying that his determination is very strong. 
  Now, in Nagata-cho, there is speculation that movements will 
be stirred for political restructuring when the political reform 
laws are passed and when general elections are held to implement 
the new election system. 
  The initial restructuring is expected between the first part 
of November when the bills pass the House of Representatives if 
the legislative actions go smoothly and the latter part of 
December. This Diet session most likely will undergo an 
extension for two weeks beginning at the scheduled end of the 
session on 15 December. 
  The potential has increased for another split in the LDP and 
the surfacing of a movement for a split in the SDPJ in 
connection with a revision and compromise concerning the 
political reform bills. 
  And, incipient movements of the foregoing nature suddenly 
surfaced in October. It appears that a young group including 
Masayasu Kitagawa and Michihiko Kano who belong to the LDP's 
Mitsuzuka faction have been making frequent contacts with 
Takemura, Kisaburo Tokai, and Hiroyuki Sonoda of the Sakigake 
Party and former members of the Mitsuzuka faction. It is well 
known that Kitagawa and his group had moved to support Takemura 
and Gotoda as prime minister candidates until the non-LDP 
government was formed. 
  Further, 47 members of the "group to create a new LDP" 
sponsored by Seiichi Ota and Shokei Arai of the LDP who just 
resigned from their factions have approached Sakigake and 
Shinseito and are said to be ready to secede from the LDP if 
passage of the reform bill is placed at risk during either the 
House of Representatives or House of Councilors proceedings. 
Officials of the group who met with this writer have said, "In 
that event, it will not be a case of defeating the opposition at 
great risk, but we will have no choice but to make a crucial 
decision with a focus on realizing the passage of the political 
reform bills within the year." 
  Further, the LDP Political Reform Promotion Parliamentarian 
League (chaired by former Prime Minister Kaifu; over 160 
members) has confirmed its intent at passage by yearend and 
that, if members of the executive department of the LDP should 
stubbornly resist political reform to the very end, according to 
officials of the alliance, they will resolutely separate 
themselves from the party conservatives and "form a new LDP and 
act as a party within a party." 
  On the other hand, even in the SDPJ, a group of 20 to 30 
conservatives who are absolutely against adoption of a small 
electoral district system have shown signs of forming a new 
force by the end of the year, indicating that both conservative 
and reformist forces are determined to secede and reorganize. 
<H3>  Farewell to Ozawa, Who Embraces Different Policy Concepts 
and Political Methods </H3>
  We should not overlook the fact that, along with movements 
of 
the foregoing nature, differences in political ideas and basic 
policy are becoming obvious among the coalition parties and 
within the LDP and that situation and its subtle effect on the 
introduction of a new election system just may instigate a 
reorganization of the political world. 
  Of special note is that the LDP has suffered a conspicuous 
drop in appeal with the appointment of President Kono, projects 
an image of century-end chaos and the appearance of rapid 
acceleration of the party dismantling process. The conceptual 
confrontation between the Kono group which favors preservation 
of the current Constitution and former Foreign Minister Watanabe 
who favors constitutional revision is now a decisive one, while 
the blueprint for the next political restructuring has been made 
clear in the eyes of the public through Kono's Diet statements 
during representative questioning in which he circuitously 
criticized Ozawa, who aims for a mini-super power, and expressed 
support for the constitutional preservation stance of Hosokawa 
and Takemura. 
  To begin with, 17 years ago, when Kono formed the Shinjiyu 
[New Liberal] Club, Hosokawa was the first individual that the 
former recruited for membership among members of the House of 
Councilors and had listed him as a member when he announced 
formation of the club. 
  However, the club encountered the opposition of Kakuei 
Tanaka, then leader of the LDP, and the idea of including 
Hosokawa as a club member had to be abandoned at the last 
minute. It would not be strange for the two with very close 
ideas to unite some time in the future. 
  Further, Tsuneo Suzuki, former member of the House of 
Representatives, who has served as President Kono's secretary 
and has worked with Kono on political actions ever since the 
Shinjiyu Club days, has been a member of the Utopia Study Group 
ever since its inception and, according to an official of 
Sakigake, in response to solicitations to join Sakigake during 
the last general election, "He pondered the invitation 
extensively, but chose to remain loyal to Mr. Kono." However, he 
is very close to Takemura. 
  Also, Tanaka, who is the prime minister's special assistant, 
once belonged to the Shinjiyu Club, has ideas that are similar 
to those of Kono and Suzuki, and Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Hatoyama expressed views which are in agreement with those of 
Takemura and Suzuki during Utopia Study Group sessions. Kunio 
Hatoyama, former minister of education and younger brother of 
the senior Hatoyama, is now unaffiliated in terms of political 
party, but he once was elected to the House of Representatives 
on the recommendation of the Shinjiyu Club. Additionally, it is 
reported that Vice Speaker of the House of Representatives 
Heisuke Kujiraoka, former director general of the Environmental 
Agency, was strongly recommended by Kono, Suzuki, and Hosokawa 
for his present position. 
  It is quite possible that the core of a new political force 
will be formed in one or two years embracing constitutional 
preservation and antinationalism and composed of the current 
staff of the Prime Minister's Official Residence, the LDP Kono 
group and the Doi-Kujiraoka group in the House of 
Representatives. 
  On the other hand, we can anticipate formation of a new 
group 
centered on individuals who seek constitutional revision with 
Ozawa as leader and including former Foreign Minister Watanabe; 
Kozo Watanabe, acting president of Shinseito; Mutsuki Kato, 
former LDP Political Research Council and currently unaffiliated 
in terms of political party; Takeo Nishioka, former minister of 
education; and Toshio Yamaguchi, former minister of labor. It is 
said that Takemura's opinion is that "the Hosokawa government 
will last until the next general election." 
  Takemura is currently contemplating a parting of ways with 
Ozawa's Shinseito, whose policy concepts and political methods 
are entirely different, before or after the next general 
election, which is expected to take place at the earliest after 
the spring of 1995. 
  In that event, there is the possibility that Takemura and 
his 
Sakigake will avoid a unified faction composed of non-LDP 
elements and advocated by Ozawa and launch a separate election 
campaign. 
  Takemura once told this writer, "I would like to work 
towards 
a goal of creating politics that is not deeply influenced by the 
obsolete sensitivities of Nagata-cho." 
  In this regard, it appears that the future political 
objective of the "Takeo Miki of the Heisei era" will be to 
reinforce his contacts and affiliations with junior and 
reformist groups of the LDP and the junior members of the SDPJ 
in applying diversionary tactics against Ozawa's Shinseito, 
ultimately form a new party of 50 or so members, and become a 
core element in a coalition government based on a new framework. 
It will be then that Takemura who as an idealistic but pragmatic 
politician will demonstrate his true capabilities.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] Will Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura's strategy to 
influence Prime Minister Hosokawa and dispose of Shinseito 
Secretary General Ozawa succeed? 
  Reportedly Prime Minister Hosokawa has recently placed more 
priority on Ozawa than Takemura. 
  "I received a necktie from Liberal DEmocratic Party [LDP] 
LDP 
Secretary General Mori." "Even Mr. Gotoda agreed with my idea." 
Recently, Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura has been going out of 
his way to emphasize his substantial ties with the LDP. It is as 
if he is saying that he will establish an agreement with the LDP 
concerning passage of the political reform bill. 
<H5>  Scathing Comments Made About Ozawa Off the Record </H5>
  "Oh! This is an off-the-record comment. Don't make a record 
of it." Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, 59, 
habitually smiles wryly and he licks his somewhat thick lips in 
making this statement. 
  It is the political reporter's role to pump for confidential 
information when he hears such off-the-record conversations and 
notes incipient friction emanating in the Hosokawa government. 
  Recently, holding informal discussions with Takemura has 
become popular among political reporters. That trend is not 
based solely on the fact that he has a lot of information 
because of his position as the chief cabinet secretary. The 
reason is that they can hear Takemura's sensitive comments about 
Shinseito President Ichiro Ozawa, 51, who is the second major 
functionary in sustaining the coalition party and whose 
political beliefs and methods differ from those of Takemura. 
  Takemura versus Ozawa. The rivalry between the two was well 
known when the current government came into being. However, as 
deliberations on the political reform bills reach a critical 
period, differences in the objectives of the two have become 
more obvious. Both tread on common ground in aiming for passage 
of the reform bills with the support of Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's intense popularity, but they differ widely about the 
design of the second political restructuring. The chief cabinet 
secretary wants to establish ties with a reformed LDP and part 
ways with Shinseito. On the other hand, the leading personality 
of the ruling party would like to gain the support of those 
sympathetic to his cause and eliminate Takemura--with whom he is 
incompatible--and his group from the coalition. These two who 
hold the key to passage of the bills are waging a "desperate 
battle" about negotiations with the LDP in the face of the 
pending Diet vote on the bills. This is why interviews with 
Takemura, who has a tendency to be verbose, is so popular. 
  In any event, allow me to introduce a number of Takemura 
statements based on the evaluation of political editors of 
national newspapers who say, "interviews with Takemura are 
richer in information than the regular press conferences held by 
the Prime Minister's Official Residence." 
  The first quote concerns the research group arranged by 
former Labor Minister Toshio Yamaguchi which became a topic of 
conversation as having resulted in the establishment of ties 
between Ozawa and former Deputy Prime Minister Michio Watanabe. 
  (27 September) "Even Hiroyuki Sonoda and Shusei Tanaka of 
our 
Sakigake were invited to join the research group. No way will 
they join. However, `Chinnen' Yamaguchi occasionally joins some 
of the key individuals and does some astounding things. He has 
even visited the Prime Minister's Official Residence. Mr. 
Hosokawa doesn't particularly like `Chinnen,' but the latter has 
critical information. That's because someone is manipulating him 
in the background." 
  There's no need to mention that "someone...in the 
background" 
is Ozawa and it seems that Ozawa's temerity in unhesitatingly 
attempting to recruit officials from Sakigake displeased 
Takemura. Even so, this particular quote can be regarded as a 
light diversionary statement, though in the form of a sharp 
off-the-record remark. 
  (4 October) When one reporter asked, "In Russia, is Yeltsin 
of greater value than the congress?" Takemura replied, "Your 
question is akin to asking, `Is Mr. Ozawa of greater value than 
Mr. Seiroku Kajiyama, former LDP secretary general. Are you 
going to make a memo of my statement? If so, please write, `I 
pray for the earliest possible return of Mr. Ozawa.'" 
  At the time, the comment was made in view of the fact that 
Ozawa was taking convalescent leave. 
  Although supposedly an off-the-record comment, the reporter 
makes a memorandum of the statement and turns it in to the 
newspaper company. The contents of the memorandum are conveyed 
to Ozawa via reporters in charge of covering Shinseito. It can 
be considered a shrewd statement made by Takemura knowing that 
it would reach Ozawa's ears through this particular circuit. 
  And, concerning the rice tariff issue, Takemura once made a 
very suggestive statement that Ozawa went over the head of 
government officials in concluding a secret agreement with the 
United States. 
  (14 October) "Before he left Washington, Agriculture 
Secretary Espy who visited Japan on the 10th, made a statement 
saying, "Noteworthy progress has been made." I wonder who did 
the negotiating. Were there any key personnel who made a trip to 
the United States at this stage? I wonder who went..." 
  In the latter part of September, Ozawa was making a trip 
through Europe. That statement was skillfully used to refer to 
rumors that Ozawa had made a secret side trip to the United 
States. 
  On the other hand, Takemura indirectly points out Ozawa's 
lack of popularity by saying, (18 October) "The discussions were 
very lively today at the government's ruling party summit 
conference, because Ozawa was absent." 
  And adds, (18 October) "Mr. Ozawa's draft law to revise the 
Diet goes too far. The mass media should provide greater 
coverage of the proposed revisions and issue cautionary 
comments." 
  Such statements represent frontal attacks on Ozawa and are 
only a couple of such statements made in rapid succession to the 
effect that Takemura does not wish to share the same destiny 
with Ozawa. 
  Fresh in the minds of the public is the episode when Ozawa 
denied a request for interviews by two newspapers and Takemura 
publicly criticized Ozawa with the comment, "Politicians are 
public figures. They should aggressively seek out involvement 
with reporters." 
  One wonders why Takemura dislikes and uses diversionary 
tactics so extensively in reference to Ozawa. 
  One reason is the sudden intimacy between Ozawa and 
Hosokawa. 
Ozawa and Hosokawa became closer by the day as the political 
reform bill neared passage. Because of that situation, rumors 
have it that Takemura who was said to have honeymoon-like 
relationships with Hosokawa from before establishment of the 
current government is no longer an insider. 
  According to sources at the Prime Minister's Residence, 
Ozawa 
and the prime minister are holding frequent secret sessions 
using the Prime Minister's Residence and hotels in Tokyo. They 
are being held at the pace of more than once a week. Telephone 
calls are being made more frequently at the rate of two calls a 
day." 
<H5>  Ozawa Confidant Says, "Takemura Is a Scoundrel" </H5>
  Now, the question is, why is Ozawa suddenly approaching 
Hosokawa and why is Takemura being avoided? Influencing the 
situation is the decisive difference in the blueprints 
envisioned by the two individuals concerning a second political 
restructuring. 
  According to a source close to the prime minister, 
Takemura's 
strategy goes this way. "Takemura visualizes elimination of the 
bloc consisting of Shinseito and Komeito and reorganization of 
the government using former Deputy Prime Minister Masaharu 
Gotoda, LDP reformists, and the Japan New Party. Takemura's move 
is highly disadvantageous to Ozawa because of the strong 
anti-Ozawa sentiment in the LDP. This is why Ozawa is suddenly 
approaching Hosokawa and assuming a strategy to separate the 
latter from Takemura." 
  Takemura is a liberal in a political sense. He cannot agree 
at all with Ozawa who advocates constitutional revision and aims 
at making Japan a political power. He wants to avoid Ozawa's 
approach and tie up with LDP reformists with whom he enjoys 
commonality in terms of constitutional and national principles. 
  According to sources at Shinseito, "Takemura has been making 
frequent contact with Gotoda at hotels in Tokyo and over the 
telephone, as well as contacting Masasuke Kitamura who rapidly 
gained prominence among young LDP reformists. Concurrent with 
such contacts, Gotoda is continuing talks with LDP President 
Yohei Kono on political reform, forming a Takemura-Gotoda-Kono 
lineup. The confrontation between Ozawa and Takemura has come to 
a stage where it is no longer reversible." 
  If Takemura has written off Ozawa, the same is true in 
reverse with Ozawa. Based on past episodes, he has already 
decided, "I can no longer deal with Takemura." 
  The strategy envisioned by Ozawa calls for a split in the 
LDP, disposal of the left wing of the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan [SDPJ] and Sakigake, unification of the Japan New Party, 
Komeito, and Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] and a quick 
reorganization. 
  According to earlier quoted sources at Shinseito, "The 
plotting goes on unmistakably. One form it is taking is the 
contacts with the prime minister and plotting with the LDP is 
being conducted confidentially. The first targeted group is 
Michio Watanabe and his group. Ozawa has held confidential talks 
with Watanabe himself on at least two occasions. Serving as 
intermediary was Mutsuki Kato. Ozawa can expect 30 followers in 
the Watanabe group. He has also contacted the Komoto faction and 
has met directly with Komoto at the end of August. Ozawa 
reportedly said, `I won't ask you to join Shinseito, but when 
the next political restructuring takes place, I would like to 
work with Kaifu and other reformists.' It seems Ozawa said that 
in return he would take care of Saburo Komoto, Komoto's son, 
when he decides to change over to the House of Representatives. 
Up to mid-September, Ozawa has also met twice with Kaifu." 
  In addition to such movements, Ozawa is also circulating 
information that is unfavorable to Takemura. Recently, sources 
close to Ozawa are constantly leaking such statements as, 
"Takemura is a scoundrel. His goal is to destroy the Hosokawa 
government. He's plotting for a change in government by 
preventing passage of the political reform bills by yearend and 
splitting the LDP. He's stating that he will push Gotoda to lead 
the next government, but it is already known that Gotoda will 
not accept. His intentions are to assume leadership of the new 
government at that point." 
  Newspapers and other mass media are now saying that the 
situation is developing so as to favor Ozawa, in view of the 
foregoing circumstances. 
  However, that is no more than a superficial observation. The 
basis for that conclusion is that, "Ozawa's only ace in the hole 
is Hosokawa." 
  Sources at Sakigake comment, "If the coalition government 
should fail, the party most adversely affected would be 
Shinseito. Sakigake, the Japan New Party, the DSP, and the SDPJ 
could align themselves with the LDP which has acquired a clean 
image because of President Kono, but as long as Ozawa is around, 
the LDP and Shinseito could never join forces. Ozawa has no 
choice but to continue supporting Hosokawa as a leader." 
  There are many aspects to the situation which are a 
disadvantage to Ozawa. Kajiyama, who once waged an "internecine 
war" and is now a natural enemy of Ozawa, has begun to move 
actively. He frequently contacts SDPJ Committee Chairman 
Tomiichi Murayama with whom Kajiyama has been on close terms 
since he was chairman of the Diet Affairs Committee. Even 
Murayama has publicly stated, "The SDPJ can win 100 seats at the 
end of the year if the midsized electoral district system is 
retained." There is a strong possibility that Murayama will join 
Kajiyama in a movement to defeat the political reform bills. LDP 
and SDPJ goals are in agreement. 
  If the LDP and SDPJ join to defeat the reform bill, Hosokawa 
will definitely move to dissolve the cabinet and call for a 
general election. 
  If that should become the case, it would clearly be 
disadvantageous for Ozawa who is using the strategy of 
preserving the Hosokawa government as long as possible and 
conducting an election only after decimating the LDP's support 
structure. 
<H5>  Making Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Ishihara an Ally </H5>
  That is the very reason why Ozawa is desperately pushing 
passage of the bill and plotting a split in the LDP, but aside 
from such adverse movements, Ozawa has another weak point. We 
are speaking of his relations with Komeito with whom he is said 
to be very close. 
  Members of the LDP are very sensitive about the Soka Gakkai, 
which is Komeito's support organization, and have intensified 
their attack on unity of church and state ever since Komeito 
became a part of the coalition government. 
  According to LDP sources, "However, since Ozawa will have no 
choice but to join hands with Komeito as a matter of strategy, 
those attacks will have a severe adverse impact. The presence of 
members within Shinseito who are sensitive to the Soka Gakkai 
renders Komeito a double-edged sword for Ozawa." 
  On the other hand, developments such as failure of the 
reform 
bills to pass and dissolution and general elections won't have 
much of an adverse impact on Takemura. 
  The earlier quoted sources at Sakigake comment, "Takemura 
has 
the added advantage of the option of joining with the LDP. 
Takemura also anticipates dissolution." 
  Diet member Seiichi Ota has publicly stated that he cannot 
join Ozawa but could do so with Takemura. 
  Ota remarks, "The only reason the present coalition parties 
are maintaining a semblance of balance is because of the 
presence of Takemura. We need to give him positive recognition 
for this fact. If Takemura did not exist, Ozawa's Shinseito and 
Ichikawa's Komeito would join forces to control the current 
government. The only reason why the two are not able to take 
such action is because of Mr. Takemura's lone struggle. The 
liberal faction of the LDP is ready to form an alliance at any 
time with Takemura who opposes the Ozawa-Ichikawa bloc." 
  Further, the real chief of staff within the Prime Minister's 
Official Residence, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobuo 
Ishihara in charge of administration, was senior to Takemura in 
the Ministry of Home Affairs. In the past, Ishihara is said to 
have favored Ozawa, but with Takemura's appointment to a 
position in the Prime Minister's Official Residence, he is said 
to have altered his stance. Even on the issue of imposing 
tariffs on rice, Ishihara has joined hands with Takemura in 
negotiating with the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and 
Fisheries. 
  After reviewing the situation as covered thus far in this 
article, one comes to the conclusion that there is more 
flexibility in Takemura's strategy calling for support for 
Hosokawa until the very end, while maintaining liaison with 
liberal factions of the LDP such as Gotoda and Kono so that he 
can join hands with them if the need arises. 
  Diet man Susumu Yanase has said, "Mr. Takemura is a 
politician with sound judgment. Mention is made that he clashes 
often with Mr. Ozawa, but if he thinks clashing would be to his 
advantage, he will do so in the manner of a stage show. He does 
not clash with others with any serious motivations." 
  It appears Yanase is saying that Takemura skillfully 
conceals 
his true intent while steadily working for points. Another 
Sakigake official remarks, "The current government was 
established, to begin with, because of the close relationship 
between Takemura and Hosokawa. Although Hosokawa appears very 
easy-going, he is very shrewd in dealing with Takemura and Ozawa 
and sustaining the current government. He will probably allow 
Ozawa to conduct himself as he wishes until he wins passage of 
the political reform bills. However, the important point is that 
Mr. Hosokawa and Ozawa are of two different types. In the end, 
there will be a Hosokawa-Takemura team and Ozawa will be 
discarded. Takemura exercises confidence in this respect." 
  Takemura had dinner with Hosokawa in the evening of 22 
October. He licked his lips as he said, "We talked about many 
subjects. We even talked about Ichiro Ozawa. After all, the 
situation is such that we couldn't avoid the topic." 
  Even if there is a change in government, there will be no 
change in efforts to determine the intentions of opposing 
parties or in Machiavellianism. In order to realize Prime 
Minister Hosokawa's public pledge to "implement political reform 
by the end of the year," it will be essential to gain passage of 
the bill in the House of Representatives by the middle of 
November. As confusion in the political situation deepens, the 
question is, who will have the last laugh--Takemura or Ozawa? 
  It appears the main battle of the cold war concerning 
political restructuring is yet to be fought.

<F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 21 January Evening Edition] </F>
  [Text] The government on 20 January firmed up the outline 
of the economic stimulus package to be finalized next week. It 
envisages investing more than 3 trillion yen in projects to 
procure public-use land, to assist small and medium businesses, 
and to expand loans by the Housing Finance Corporation [HFC]. 
The total will come to almost 7 trillion yen if about 3.5 
trillion yen's worth of public works projects are added to it. 
In addition, there will be measures to boost the financial and 
security markets, one of which is to provide financial 
assistance for clearing bad debts. If some 7 trillion yen's 
worth of measures to reduce income taxes and residents' taxes 
are added, the total comes to about 14.7 trillion yen, which 
means the stimulus package will be the biggest ever, surpassing 
that of April last year. 
  The new economic measures contain a key project aimed at 
improving liquidity of land, and the project will require 
investment of 500 billion yen to 1 trillion yen to promote 
acquisition of land for public use. Specifically, this means 
additional appropriation of funds for the Housing and Urban 
Development Corporation to acquire land for future housing 
construction. It will also provide funds for local housing 
corporations to pay for interest accrued from land purchases. 
The government is also considering reducing the tax on profits 
from land transfer. 
  To support small and medium businesses, ceilings on 
low-interest loans by such government-run financial institutions 
as the Small Business Finance Corporation and People's Finance 
Corporation will be extended to enable more of them to benefit 
from the loans. In the area of measures to promote employment, 
a new system will be created to help job-creating small and 
medium industries expand their plant and equipment. A total of 
1,300 billion yen will be made available in this area. 
  Where loans by the Housing Finance Corporation are 
concerned, 
an additional 100,000 housing units received benefits under the 
emergency economic measures effected in September last year, and 
the number of housing units eligible for HFC loans expanded to a 
total of 700,000 in 1993. In order to further promote 
investments in housing construction and to make it the prime 
mover in pulling the economy ahead, additional loans for 70,000 
housing units -- worth more than 1 trillion yen -- will be made 
available under the new package of economic measures.

<F P=106> [By Tokyo office economic reporter Yasuhiro Suzuki; from the </F>
"Kasumigaseki at the Crossroads" series; part one of a 
three-part series of articles on the Labor Ministry: "Employment 
Policy That Cannot Shed Its Old Skin"] 
  [Excerpts]Ministry Objects To Establishing 
"Headquarters" 
  Soon after the new year started, on 6 January the government 
set up the Emergency Employment-Measures Headquarters headed by 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. According to a senior 
official of the coalition parties, the original plan was to have 
only five economic ministers -- such as the finance minister, 
minister of international trade and industry, and labor minister 
-- participate in it in addition to the prime minister, but the 
organization turned into one of pancabinet members at the strong 
request of the prime minister. 
  But people at the Labor Ministry are not necessarily happy 
about this. They are in fact cold about it and say: "That 
headquarters has been created for reasons of publicity. No 
concrete results can be expected from it." 
  It was on 27 December that the coalition made a formal 
request to the prime minister concerning the establishment of 
the headquarters. Labor Ministry officials, however, on the same 
day were already telling coalition officials: "The Labor 
Ministry will lead it. Please scrap the plan to make the prime 
minister its head." Apparently, the establishment of the 
emergency measure headquarters displeased the labor bureaucrats 
who believe that "unemployment issues belong only to the Labor 
Ministry." 
  Of course, the ministry is proud of itself. An official of 
the ministry's Employment Security Bureau said, "We think that 
we are doing everything that anyone could think of." The 
comprehensive unemployment countermeasures under the Total 
Program To Support Employment announced by the Labor Ministry in 
December are worth 326 billion yen in budgetary terms. Tetsuya 
Sakamoto, director of the ministry's Employment Policy Division, 
said, "That is about three times the size of the employment 
program implemented at the time of the high-yen-caused 
recession." 
  The Labor Ministry for a long time has "upheld the high 
employment rate" as the employment security administration's 
royal banner. A typical example is the action taken to 
establish employment subsidies in 1985 -- shortly after the 
first [as published] oil crisis. It was a system aimed at 
assisting companies which had trouble continuing employment for 
their workers because the firms' production had fallen. Under 
the system, the government paid part of the cost of keeping 
employees on house leave (waiting at home), to provide job 
training, or to reassign employees to different areas. Its 
purpose was to prevent the companies from firing their employees 
or from encouraging them to resign, and the ministry has used 
this as a trump card to ride out unemployment problems during 
recessions. 
<H5>  Rising Criticism of the Subsidies </H5>
  But now there are large amounts of criticism of the 
subsidies 
which insist that the subsidies are "pressuring companies into 
maintaining employment and thus are hurting the liquidity of 
labor. This system is becoming untenable for the mature Japanese 
economy." The plan for expanded employment assistance subsidies 
contained in the Total Program To Support Employment envisages 
raising the wage subsidies for those in job training from the 
current 75 percent to 80 percent [of wages received]. This is 
an unprecedentedly high rate. Some within the ministry 
complained, "The government's paying 80 percent of the pay makes 
the employees almost public servants. Is it necessary to go that 
far?" 
  More recently, critical voices are conspicuous about the 
past 
labor administration policy of emphasizing only employment 
security. As for employment subsidies, some economists went so 
far as to declare that they "impede Japan's efforts to improve 
its economic structure." The rationale for the criticism is 
that while the industrial structure needs to be converted and 
improved without delay in preparation for the upcoming 
deregulation and market liberalization, the labor sector, which 
will form the basis for the structure, is not changing at all. 
  The Labor Ministry by all means wants to adhere to its 
slogan 
of "job security," and it is desperately resisting any attempt 
to make it change that policy. [passage omitted on examples of 
the ministry's policy] 
<H5>  Inability To Come Up With an Aggressive Concept </H5>
  In mentioning the Labor Ministry's reason for being negative 
about increasing employment liquidity, Noriomi Soya, director of 
the ministry's Secretariat, said, "We cannot yet see any 
specific evidence of new industries emerging which will create 
jobs." What he meant was that even though many people think 
that deregulation will create new businesses in the fields of 
communications, the environment, and social welfare, evidence of 
this possibility has not yet even started to appear. Thus, the 
ministry cannot agree to increased liquidity in jobs. 
  This cautious stand by the Labor Ministry led Teruto Emoto, 
chairman of the Confederation of Japan Automobile Workers 
Unions, to say: "These people cannot escape their turf 
consciousness of the past. Many of the policies they come up 
with are ex post facto in nature." Labor Minister Chikara 
Sakaguchi himself complained: "Why can't the ministry come up 
with a daring vision on industrial employment before other 
people ask for it? The ministry is lacking in aggressive 
ideas." [passage omitted explaining the ministry's passivity] 
  While criticism of the bureaucrats is growing, the Labor 
Ministry is being asked to restructure itself as well.

  [Text] The National Space Development Agency of Japan 
[NASDA] announced on 17 January that Japan's first domestically 
produced large rocket will be launched at 0700 on 1 February at 
the Tanegashima Space Center, located in Tanega-cho. 
  The launch window had been from 0500 to 0900 on 1 February, 
but was officially set after NASDA observed that the fueling 
rehearsal held on 14 January was successful. Thus, the window 
was narrowed by two hours, from 0700 to 0900. 
  The reason given by the Tanegashima Space Center for 
narrowing the launch window and moving it back two hours from 
the initial schedule was that "we set it after taking into 
consideration the ease of the rehearsal operations." 
  A fueling rehearsal in preparation for the launch was held 
on 23 December 1993, but problems were discovered at eight 
points, including leaks in the helium [as published] pressure 
valves on the LE-7 main engine that resulted in insufficient 
pressure. So parts were replaced and another rehearsal was held 
on 14 January. There was some trouble with the movable nozzles 
on the solid rocket boosters during the second rehearsal, but 
this was not a major problem.

  [Text] In the predawn hours of 18 January, two satellites 
were placed in the satellite fairing of the H-II, which is 
scheduled to be launched from the Tanegashima Space Center, 
located in Minami Tanega-cho, Kumage-gun, on 1 February by the 
National Space Development Agency of Japan [NASDA]. Launch 
preparations for Japan's first purely domestically produced 
rocket have been completed, and only some detailed work remains 
to be done. 
  The two satellites to be launched in the H-II will be the 
OREX, the orbital reentry experimental vehicle for the HOPE, 
Japan's version of an unmanned space shuttle now being 
developed; and the VEP mini satellite, a payload to verify the 
H-II's performance. 
  The 12-meter-tall satellite fairing containing these two 
satellites was slowly moved on a trailer from the satellite 
fairing hangar at 0250 on 18 January, taking about two hours to 
travel the two kilometers between the hangar and the Yoshinobu 
launch pad launch-test tower. 
  Then four cables lifted the fairing up about 40 meters, 
where 
it was docked to the rocket, which had already been placed in 
the launch tower.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, January 26 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
newspaper ARDIYN ERH informs about the continuing trip of 
Chairman of the Great State Hural N. Bagabandi around Tub Aimak 
of the country. He is getting acquainted with the course of 
agricultural works, the life and demands of herdsmen. The 
newspaper publishes the information concerning the outcome of 
the autumn session of the Great State Hural which contains 
figure showings relating to the session. 
  On the whole the plenary sittings of the session lasted for 
some 380 hours which implies that each sitting continued for 
more than six hours a day. On average every member of the 
parliament took the floor 58 times. In this respect most 
productive was R. Gonchigdorj speaking totally over 818 minutes. 
The newspaper noted that with the activities of the Mongolian 
parliament have been acquainted such persons as President of 
Kazakhstan N. Nazarbayev and officials accompanying him during 
his visit, the Ambassador of the USA to Mongolia J. Johnson, 
representatives of local administration, students from the 
Mongolian State National University studying politology [as 
received] and so on. 
  The newspaper published the answers by President of the 
Mongolbank [Central Bank of Mongolia] D. Molomjamts to the 
correspondent's questions referring to the trends and lines of 
monetary policy for 1994 having been approved by the parliament. 
D. Molomjamts stresses that in the current year as the 
Mongolbank as the commercial banks are to assign the most of 
credits being allotted to the support of the production. 
According to him, certain challenges are evoked by the mutual 
indebtedness of the banks, enterprises and companies. In 
conformity with the recommendations of the president of the 
country the Mongolbank is intending to allocate sources for 
financing the governmental "gold" programme. 
  The newspaper carries a list of organizations with state 
running property and entities relating to private sector to 
which there have been transferred former military settlements 
and other premises where had dislocated the Russian troops. 
Those objects were turned over to the Mongolian side in 
accordance with the agreement between the two sides. 
  The central organ of the Mongolian National Democratic Party 
newspaper ERH CHOLOO (FREEDOM) publishes an interview of its 
correspondent with Chairman of the Dzabhan Aimak's Committee N. 
Battsereg. He told about the beginning in 1990 of the 
democratic movement in the country. N. Battsereg considers that 
the beginning of the democratic process which sometimes is 
called "revolution" was connected not only with the youth and 
the capital of the country. According to him, those who were not 
satisfied with the former social system were not only in the 
cities but also in the countryside. The social basis for 
democratic changes he said was among the herdsmen of the country 
as well. 
  The newspaper publishes an article by chairman of the 
Mongolian Social Democratic Party B. Batbayar under the heading 
"The Democracy Is the Only One Way for Defending Mongolia's 
Independence". The article underlines that a new state system 
formed for the last four years has attained great achievements 
despite all the faults and blunders committed. According to the 
author, the pursuing by Mongolia an open policy is forming 
preconditions of securing its independence taking into account 
the current situation in the world and the geographic location 
of the country between the two great powers. 
  Member of the National Democratic Party B. Terguun in his 
article published by the newspaper believes that in Mongolia 
there are those supporting Taiwan including the composition of 
the leadership of the state and government. B. Terguun 
considers that it is necessary to adhere to pursue a policy of 
China which is personified by the People's Republic of China.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 28 (KCNA) -- The United States 
and the South Korean puppets are reportedly having consultations 
to hasten the projected deployment of Patriot missiles in South 
Korea. 
  It is an unpardonable grave military challenge to scheme to 
introduce Patriot missiles in South Korea at a time when 
DPRK-U.S. contacts have taken place and the third round of 
DPRK-U.S. talks are expected for a fundamental solution to the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  It is self-evident that the deployment of Patriot missiles 
in 
South Korea will key up the tensions on the Korean peninsula and 
increase the danger of war. 
  This scheme vividly shows the reckless attempt of the United 
States and the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique to contain the 
DPRK militarily has gone beyond the danger line. 
  The hostile forces of the United States and the South Korean 
puppet clique claim that the deployment of Patriot missiles is 
to "counter the threat of missile attack from North Korea." But 
this is no more than a crafty plea to justify their dangerous 
introduction of lethal weapons. 
  The real purpose of their massive shipment of Patriot 
missiles into South Korea under the pretext of "threat of 
missile attack" is to impede the progress of the DPRK-U.S. 
talks for a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula and impose their unreasonable demand for 
"nuclear inspection" on the DPRK through pressure and threat. 
  The projected deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea 
is motivated by the persistent anti-socialist, anti-DPRK 
campaign of the United States. 
  Not content with the deployment of more than 1,000 nuclear 
weapons in South Korea, the traitor Kim Yong-sam allowed the 
introduction of Patriot missiles to kill fellow countrymen. By 
doing so, he revealed once again his true color as a heinous 
traitor, flunkeyist and "civilian" fascist outdistancing the 
preceding military fascist dictators. 
  If the United States and its followers think they can subdue 
the DPRK with pressure and threat, it is a big mistake. That 
method may lead the situation to a hopeless phase, far from 
resolving the problem. 
  The United States must look straight at the reality and act 
with discretion and drop at once the reckless plan of Patriot 
missile deployment in South Korea.

  [Text] According to a report, the United States and the 
South Korean puppets have worked out a plan to deploy Patriot 
missiles to South Korea and are repeatedly holding consultations 
to accelerate its implementation. It is an unpardonable grave 
military challenge [yongho halsu omnun omjunghan kunsajok tojon 
haengwi] to scheme to introduce Patriot missiles to South Korea 
at a time when DPRK-U.S. contacts have taken place and the third 
round of DPRK-U.S. talks are expected for a fundamental solution 
to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. It is clear to 
everyone that the deployment of Patriot missiles to South Korea 
will heat up the tensions on the Korean peninsula and increase 
the danger of war. 
  The scheme to deploy Patriot missiles to South Korea vividly 
shows that the reckless attempt of the United States and the Kim 
Yong-sam nation-selling traitorous clique to contain [cheap] our 
Republic militarily has gone beyond the danger line [omjung 
kyeson]. 
  Some conservative forces and bellicose elements in the U.S. 
military have recently unhesitatingly made violent, war-frenzied 
remarks that international sanctions should be imposed on North 
Korea, strict countermeasures should be expressed to North 
Korea, the United States should confront North Korea with armed 
forces, and so forth. Timed to coincide with this, the United 
States is scheming to bring Patriot missiles into South Korea. 
This is not an accident at all. 
  The hostile forces of the United States and the South Korean 
puppet clique claim that the deployment of Patriot missiles is 
to counter the threat of a missile attack from North Korea. 
This is no more than a crafty plea to justify their dangerous 
introduction of lethal weapons. 
  A threat of a missile attack from North Korea did not exist 
from the outset. It is merely a fabrication of the enemies. The 
real purpose of their massive shipment of Patriot missiles into 
South Korea under the pretext of a nonexistent threat of a 
missile attack is to impede the progress of the DPRK-U.S. talks 
for a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula and impose their unreasonable demand for nuclear 
inspection on us through pressure and threat. 
  The projected deployment of Patriot missiles to South Korea 
is motivated by the persistent antisocialist and anti-Republic 
campaign of the United States. 
  Not content with the deployment of more than 1,000 nuclear 
weapons in South Korea, the traitor Kim Yong-sam allowed the 
introduction of lethal Patriot weapons [Patriot sarin mugi] to 
harm [haechida] fellow countrymen. By doing so, he revealed once 
again his dirty true color as a heinous traitor, flunkeyist, and 
civilian traitor outdistancing the preceding military fascist 
dictators. 
  If the United States and its followers think they can subdue 
[kulbok] us with pressure and threat, they are mistaken. That 
method may lead the situation to a catastrophe [paguk], far from 
resolving the problems. 
  The United States should look straight at the reality and 
act 
with discretion and drop at once the reckless plan of Patriot 
missile deployment to South Korea.

<F P=106> [Sergey Agafonov report: "A Total of 160 Russian Nuclear </F>
Scientists and Missilemen Helped North Korea To Create a Nuclear 
Bomb. The Japanese Have Learned This From a Secret Report by 
the Russian General Staff"] 
  [Text] Tokyo -- The Japanese weekly SHUKAN BUNSHUN carries 
a detailed account of a secret report on North Korean nuclear 
affairs prepared by the Russian General Staff and an interview 
with an unnamed official involved in compiling that report, 
referred to in a note as "a leader." The report is entitled 
"The Russian Federation's Military Policy in the Asia and 
Pacific Region Under the New Military-Political Conditions." 
  It seems that more can be seen from the top of our General 
Staff building than from the U.S., Japanese, or NATO 
counterparts. At any rate, Russian specialists and analysts are 
more candid on the problem of the North Korean nuclear program 
and stricter in their judgments than their Western colleagues, 
who recently have repeatedly shared information with journalists 
-- true, their own journalists, not foreigners. It follows from 
the report, prepared for Grachev and then forwarded to Yeltsin 
(according to the Japanese magazine, which was told all this by 
our talkative secret agents in Moscow), that Pyongyang has 
scored major achievements in implementing a missile program and 
a nuclear program. The DPRK already has its own nuclear 
warheads and several hundred delivery vehicles capable of 
delivering the payload. 
  It is clear from the Russian report and from the mysterious 
"leader's" comments on it that Pyongyang embarked with 
particular zeal on its nuclear missile program in the second 
half of the eighties, with active Russian participation. Almost 
160 Russian nuclear scientists and missilemen have passed 
through North Korean laboratories and specialized centers since 
then. At present nine Russian nuclear scientists and 17 highly 
qualified missile specialists are working in North Korea. This 
is outside the framework of bilateral cooperation and is 
unofficial, as it were -- according to the "leader's" comments, 
many of our scientists have changed their names, and some have 
taken DPRK citizenship. Only it is not this that is important 
but the fact that the project to create the Korean Nodong-1 
intermediate-range missile was successfully completed with the 
assistance of Russian brains, and North Korea has accumulated a 
sufficient stock of enriched nuclear raw materials with the help 
of Russian scientists and technologies and now possesses 
approximately 10-12 kg of uranium-235 and 20 kg of 
plutonium-239. Citing the testimonies of four Russian 
specialists who recently returned from the DPRK after working in 
Korean nuclear complexes, the report maintains that Pyongyang 
already possesses one or two nuclear warheads and by the end of 
this year will roll several more off the conveyor belt. The 
DPRK is now engaged in creating a new generation of Nodong-2 
solid-fuel missiles with an increased hit range. According to 
Russian estimates, in the very near future our fuel technologies 
and know-how and our missile scientists and solid-fuel 
specialists will be objects of special attention for Pyongyang's 
agents. 
  In this connection the report proposes revising all existing 
technological agreements between Russia and the DPRK, stopping 
the leak of cadres, and devoting special attention to 
bridge-building with the United States, South Korea, and Japan 
for extensive coordination of actions. It is even proposed that 
we think about the prospect of creating some kind of regional 
ABM system involving Russia, Japan, and the United States. At 
the same time it is pointed out that not only Russia but also 
China has been involved in the DPRK's nuclear affairs, and the 
Chinese factor is now becoming the key one. 
  The document cited at length by the Japanese magazine is 
stamped "top secret" and was prepared by the Russian Defense 
Ministry General Staff Military-Strategic Analysis Center. 
After being read by Grachev and Yeltsin, extracts from the 
report were forwarded on the president's instructions to the 
U.S. Defense Department (within the framework of an information 
exchange). A facsimile of a Russian Defense Ministry form with 
the issue number 001 SM-137 and date of publication 22 October 
1993 is even given as an illustration. In short, there are no 
doubts about the authenticity of the document itself, but some 
questions do arise, and it makes sense to ask them. The first 
and most important question: On what unspecified grounds does 
Russian General Staff information get into Japanese hands, 
accompanied, moreover, by detailed comments and explanations by 
a "leader" working, to judge from the wording employed by the 
weekly, in the structure of the General Staff itself? Maybe no 
major secrets have been divulged, but the question needs to be 
answered if only for one reason -- a Japanese audience is the 
first to learn about the Russian military department's 
assessments, while the Russian audience, as is already the 
custom, is considered "second class." 
  Second question: On what terms and in what circumstances did 
the Japanese weekly obtain exclusive material from the Russian 
Defense Ministry? If it was on instructions from chiefs 
conducting an intricate publicity operation, I would like to 
have an idea of that intention. If it was without the chiefs' 
knowledge, it would be even better to know the whereabouts of 
the secret key which opens Russian General Staff safes for 
Japanese guests. 
  Finally, a third question, again one of considerable 
importance: Who in Japan (or some other country) will be the 
next happy possessor of Russian secret documents? If the 
Russian mass media are not old enough to have the honor of being 
the first to learn the Russian military department's viewpoint, 
they must at least get their bearings in the information area 
and know in which foreign journal or newspaper it will be 
possible to familiarize themselves with the views of their own 
Defense Ministry.

headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 28 (KCNA) -- The U.S. authority 
gave instructions to form a "special advisory committee" with 
non-governmental experts to investigate the radiation tests, 
when materials of those tests on human bodies were being 
disclosed one after another in the United States. 
  Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN today says: 
  This is part of the crafty ruses to whitewash the inhuman 
acts committed systematically by the United States. Recalling 
the materials of radiation tests on human bodies brought to 
light in the United States of late, the analyst says: 
  Those tests were aimed at realizing the ambition for nuclear 
monopoly by largely increasing the production of nuclear 
weapons. Radiation tests on human bodies were carried out in 
real earnest each time the U.S. Government was going to 
manufacture a new type of nuclear weapon. This was a heinous 
crime of the U.S. warmaniacs to dominate the world with nuclear 
weapons and a shocking act of murder to which innocent Americans 
fell victims. 
  The U.S. Government must feel compunction for this 
anti-human 
act and punish those responsible. 
  The United States' nuclear ambition has not changed at all. 
New high-efficiency nuclear weapons are being manufactured, in 
actuality, behind the screen of nuclear disarmament. This 
suggests that radiation tests on human bodies more brutal than 
in the past days might be committed in the United States. 
  The United States must renounce the ambition for nuclear 
monopoly and not repeat any more such beastly act as radiation 
tests on human bodies.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 28 (KCNA) -- The Central 
Committee [C.C.] of the Korean Christians Federation [KCF] 
hosted a reception at the People's Palace of Culture here 
Thursday for U.S. religious leader Rev. Billy Graham and his 
party. 
  Present at the reception were chairman of the KCF Central 
Committee Kang Yong-sop, chairman of the C.C., the Korean 
Catholics Association Chang Chae-chol, and other religionists 
and officials concerned. 
  Speeches were exchanged there. 
  The Rev. Billy Graham, in his speech, expressed the hope 
that 
his visit this time would help cultivate seed of friendship and 
foster sentiments of good faith between the the DPRK and the 
United States as it was being paid when their relations were in 
a difficult phase. 
  Recalling the audience granted by President Kim Il-song to 
him during his trip to Pyongyang in 1992, he praised the great 
leader President Kim Il-song as a sagacious leader. 
  He said the people in the DPRK wanted peace and Americans, 
too, hoped for the liquidation of such Cold-War leftovers as 
strained DPRK-U.S. relations. 
  He declared that he would make efforts together with other 
American religionists to improve the relations. 
  In conclusion Billy Graham wished a long life in good health 
to the great President Kim Il-song and dear Comrade Kim Chong-il.

<F P=106> ["Brazen-Faced Sophism" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 28 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
"minister of the unification board," in his "report" to Kim 
Yong-sam the traitor, threw together a balderdash about 
"possible changes" in the North, drivelling on "the permission 
of visit to the North" and "the reunion of families living 
separated in the North and the South". 
  Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says: 
  For the South Korean puppets to talk about "changes" is a 
futile attempt to keep off the ever increasing influence of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea with their short tongues. 
  Changes are needed not in the North but in the South. 
  In the South there must be a change in such a manner as 
making the society independent after putting an end to the 
colonial enslavement policy and the flunkeyist and treacherous 
policy, as democratizing the society after liquidating the 
"civilian" fascist system and as checking the moves of 
confrontation and division and heading for national unity and 
reunification. [sentence as received] 
  The worldwide trend of change oriented to independence and 
democracy must reach South Korea. But the puppets are crying 
for "changes" in the North, ignoring this trend. This reveals 
their sinister intention to stifle our socialist system by 
bringing the "wave of liberalization" to the North. 
  The puppets blared that they would "actively promote the 
reunion of separated families." This was nothing but a 
hypocritical act to veil their anti-reunification nature, 
fooling the fellow countrymen's desire of reunification with the 
humanitarian issue. 
  If they have the least intention to lessen the sufferings of 
those families, they should, first of all, have stated that they 
would send POWs Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan to their home towns so 
that they might spend their remaining years with their kinsmen. 
  The fellow countrymen who are making a vigorous march 
towards 
reunification in the '90s will never tolerate the Kim Yong-sam 
group's treacherous acts seeking only confrontation and division 
against the trend of the time.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 28 (KCNA) -- The New Year address 
of the great leader President Kim Il-song is evoking great 
repercussions upon South Korean people. 
  Ex-pressman Choe Ung-mo in Chongno District of Seoul said 
that the New Year address of the respected president gives a new 
hope and confidence to the South Korean people who are looking 
up to the North under the people-centred politics as a beacon of 
hope. He further said: 
  "His New Year address is a declaration expounding the 
historical truth that anthropocentric socialism is sure to win. 
  "This is a heavy blow to the imperialists and the group of 
traitors who are frantically trying to stifle socialism in the 
North, clamouring about `end' of socialism." 
  Kwak Chong-to, a worker residing in Mapo District of Seoul, 
said: 
  "Every sentence of the New Year address, especially the 
respected president's manifestation of a resolute position that 
pressure or threat will have no effect on the DPRK and the 
United States must see all the facts squarely and behave with 
circumspection makes us once again feel more keenly how strong 
the political and military power of the North is in the 
international arena." 
  Dissident Yi Sang-ho in Kwangju said: 
  "The respected president, considerate of the ardent desire 
of 
the fellow countrymen for reunification, reclarified in his New 
Year address that the country should be reunified by means of 
confederacy. The proposal for reunification through 
confederation is the most fair and realistic supreme proposal." 
  Min Chong-nan, a housewife in Pusan had this to say: 
  "Upon hearing that respected President Kim Il-song in his 
New 
Year address said the reunified country must be handed down to 
the generations to come, I could not go to sleep all the night 
through. Though I was a weak woman, I will devote everything to 
the sacred cause of anti-U.S. national salvation and 
reunification."

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 28 (KCNA) -- Foreigners highly 
praise the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as an illustrious 
leader of the cause of independence. 
  Pekka Rantala, chairman of the Finnish National Committee 
for 
the Study of the Chuche Idea, said the dear leader's historic 
work "Our Socialism Centred on the Masses Shall Not Perish" 
greatly contributes to the development of human thought and 
encourages the progressive people of the world in the building 
of a new society. 
  Felix Fernandez, representative of the Peruvian Committee 
for 
Support to the Independent and Peaceful Reunification of Korea, 
said dear Comrade Kim Chong-il is an illustrious leader wisely 
guiding the people's cause of independence. 
  "Today when the imperialists are working to destroy the 
faith 
in socialism in the minds of people, the Korean people under the 
guidance of the dear leader are holding higher the banner of 
socialism and instilling hope and confidence into the minds of 
people aspiring after independence," he noted. 
  Nazmul Huq Nannu, lawyer of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, 
said the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il clearly indicated the 
way for the popular masses to free themselves from exploitation 
and oppression and shape their destiny independently and 
creatively and gave theoretical answers to the questions of 
principle in realising the independence of the country and the 
nation, thus making an immortal contribution to the people's 
cause of independence. 
  Prof. Humberto Lopez of Managua National University of 
Nicaragua said the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il 
scientifically expounded that the history of the development of 
human society is a history of the people's struggle to realise 
and defend independence. This idea of his gives the popular 
masses a firm confidence in victory, the professor added. 
  Sitaram Yechury, Politburo member and secretary of the C.C. 
[Central Committee], the Communist Party of India (Marxist), 
highly praised the dear leader for his distinguished exploits 
for the strengthening and development of the international 
communist movement and the world revolution and paid tribute to 
him.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 27 (KCNA) -- Foreign media 
pointed to the illegality and invalidity of the "Ulsa Five-Point 
Treaty" forced by the Japanese imperialists upon Korea in 1905 
for a colonial rule and demanded that the Japanese Government 
frankly repent of its crime and honestly liquidate the past. 
  COURRIER DE LA CONFERANCE DE LA PAIX published in Hague, the 
Netherlands, quoted the Korean envoy, Yi Wi-chong, who went to 
the Second World Peace Conference as saying that the socalled 
"Ulsa Five-Point Treaty" in 1905 was nothing but an accord 
signed by the then foreign minister without the approval of the 
Korean emperor, that the signed document had not been ratified 
and that the "treaty" had not taken effect. 
  Egyptian GAZETTE said that with the discovery of a personal 
letter of Korean Emperor Kojong in 1906 as regards the 
illegality and invalidity of this "treaty", it has been proved 
that the colonial rule of Japan over Korea had no legal ground. 
The paper noted: Kojong said he as the emperor did not 
authorize the ministers to sign the "treaty" and the Japanese 
side faked up the "treaty" after locking up ministers. He 
declared that "it is against public law to claim that the 
`treaty' was concluded and so it is null and void." 
  The Mozambican Magazine TEMPO said the "Ulsa Five-Point 
Treaty" was faked up by Japan to colonialize Korea by 
"legalizing" its occupation of Korea and forging Korean history. 
  The Shihata News Agency of Tanzania said the personal letter 
of Emperor Kojong showed the absurdity of the argument of the 
Japanese Government for the "lawfulness" of the past "treaty". 
  Radio of Mongolia elaborated on the illegality and 
invalidity 
of the "Ulsa Five-Point Treaty" and said the Japanese 
authorities must repent of the crimes against the Korean people 
and honestly liquidate the past.

<F P=106> [From the "Ray of Chuche" program: "The Justness of Our </F>
Party's Revolutionary Economic Strategy"] 
  [Text] In his New Year's address the great leader Comrade 
Kim Il-song presented a militant task to thoroughly implement 
our party's revolutionary economic strategy and highly display 
the superiority of socialism of our own style. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: By 
thoroughly implementing our party's revolutionary strategy 
during the adjustment period for socialist economic 
construction, we must consolidate the self-reliant economic 
foundation of the country rock-firm, more smoothly ensure the 
people's lives in keeping with the socialist demand, and secure 
a new position of attack to conquer higher peaks of socialism. 
  In his New Year's address the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song presented strategic tasks to implement the 
agriculture-first, light industry-first, and foreign trade-first 
policy, give top priority to the coal industry, the power 
industry, and railway transportation, the leading sectors of the 
people's economy, and continuously develop the metallurgical 
industry during the three year adjustment period. 
  Our party's revolutionary economic strategy is the most just 
policy on economic construction that was presented based on its 
scientific insights into the current state of the development of 
our country's people's economy, lawful requirements of socialist 
economic construction, and the changing situation at home and 
abroad. 
  Our party's revolutionary economic strategy is just because 
it will significantly increase the people's standard of living 
in the next few years and more highly display the superiority 
and vitality of socialism of our own style. 
  Material lives are an important part of social lives and one 
of the important features that show the superiority of the 
socialist system. How one improves the people's material lives 
is closely related to agriculture, the light industry, and 
foreign trade. 
  Our party's revolutionary economic strategy is to further 
consolidate the strong basis of the heavy industry, rapidly 
develop the light industry and agriculture and develop foreign 
trade, and, thus, significantly improve the people's lives. 
Toward that end, we must exert great efforts to develop 
agriculture. Then, we can satisfactorily solve the problem of 
food, the most important thing in the people's lives, and 
rapidly develop the overall people's economy. 
  Only when we give priority to the light industry and rapidly 
develop on a high level, can we smoothly distribute goods, 
ensure expanded reproduction at a high speed, and, thus, 
decisively increase the production of people's consumer goods. 
Only when we extensively develop foreign trade, can we 
satisfactorily solve problems in further strengthening the basis 
of the self-reliant economy and improving the people's lives. 
  Our party's revolutionary economic strategy is just also 
because it enables us to further consolidate the self-reliant 
basis of our economy to ensure that we can live on our own 
strength in the changed new environment. 
  For us to defend the honor and dignity of socialism and live 
on our own strength in any environment is our party's 
unchanging, firm principle. An important thing in living on our 
own strength is to more reasonably restructure the country's 
economic structure to comply with the changed environment and 
actual demands. 
  Our party's revolutionary economic strategy calls not only 
for giving top priority to production of agriculture, the light 
industry, and export goods, but also for continuously developing 
the coal and power industries and the metallurgical industry, 
more satisfactorily solving the railway transportation problem, 
and strengthening the independence and self-reliance of our 
economy, thus providing a firm guarantee for our people to live 
on their own strength in any condition. 
  When our people eat rice and meat soup, wear silk clothes, 
and live in tile-roofed house by thoroughly implementing our 
party's revolutionary economic strategy, the enemies' plot to 
isolate, blockade, and suffocate [chilsik] our country cannot 
succeed no matter how hard it may strengthen. Even bourgeois 
ideology and literature cannot infiltrate into our country. 
Also, the justness of our party's revolutionary economic 
strategy enables us to firmly build a new launching base to 
occupy the higher socialist hill. 
  In general, a strategy presents a guideline for the prospect 
of development in the near future, as well as the development of 
the next stage. Our party's revolutionary economic strategy is 
a practical and prospective blueprint to open a bright prospect 
for the future development of our economy, which has been 
greatly advanced during the Third Seven-Year Plan. 
  Our party has set three years as a period for an adjustment. 
This is very appropriate and correct. During this period, our 
people are urged to concentrate their efforts on agriculture, 
light industry, and external trade. This becomes the wisest 
policy to prepare for a new attack [saeroun konggyok chunbirul 
kachugiwihan]. 
  When we vigorously struggle to consummate the task of rural 
theses, effect an upturn in the people's consumer goods 
production, correct the structure and method of the external 
trade, and largely expand and develop it during the period for 
an adjustment, our people's economy will be more vigorously 
strengthened and developed. By so doing, we can firmly build the 
new launching base and boldly embark upon the road of the grand 
march to occupy the higher hill in the socialist construction. 
  Truly, the presentation of the revolutionary economic 
strategy is a clear demonstration of the wisdom of the 
leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who have always an extraordinary 
wisdom and far-sighted scientific insight and who are 
victoriously leading the economic construction battle. 
  All party members and working people must uphold and 
thoroughly implement our party's revolutionary economic 
strategy. As a result, they must glorify socialism of our own 
style more highly.

Point for Socialist Construction To Enter a New Developmental 
Stage"] 
  [Text] All party members and working people throughout the 
country who heard the historic New Year's address delivered by 
the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song to all the people on the 
beginning of the new year 1994 are now rising up with great 
faith and optimism as one for the worthwhile struggle to 
implement the militant tasks presented in the New Year's address. 
  The new year 1994, which all our people have greeted with 
faith and optimism, is a meaningful year that will be recorded 
as a brilliant page in the annals of our revolution and 
socialist construction. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught in his New 
Year's 
address: The new year 1994 is a revolutionary turning point 
when our country's socialist construction will enter a new 
developmental stage, as well as a year of worthwhile struggle in 
which the entire party, the entire Army, and all the people will 
be mobilized to effect a great revolutionary upsurge in all 
fronts. 
  All our party members and working people are now faced with 
the honorable and responsible task to make the new year 1994 a 
historical turning point for our country's revolution and 
construction by upholding and vigorously struggling to implement 
the militant tasks presented by the great leader in his New 
Year's address. 
  The road ahead is bright, but rough, because we have to 
overcome many obstacles and difficulties. The international 
environment for our revolution is very complex and tense and we 
are now building socialism in acute confrontation with the enemy. 
  Thus, we should further increase the country's political, 
economic, and military strength by completely implementing the 
revolutionary line of independence, self-reliance, and 
self-defense and by vigorously carrying out the three 
revolutions -- ideological, technological, and cultural -- in 
accordance with the prevailing situation and the demand of our 
developing revolution, as the great leader elucidated in his New 
Year's address. 
  The complete implementation of our party's revolutionary 
economic strategy is more important than anything else in making 
this year a revolutionary turning point for our country's 
socialist construction to enter a new developmental stage. 
  Our party's revolutionary economic strategy presented at the 
21st plenary session of the party's Sixth Central Committee held 
last year is the most just and most revolutionary line for 
consolidating the country's independent economic base and for 
improving the people's living standard in accordance with the 
demand of socialism. 
  When we completely implement this strategy, we can 
demonstrate the might of socialism of our own style more 
vigorously and can occupy a new attack position to reach a 
higher ground of socialism. It is important for us to adhere to 
the agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first 
policy this year. Above all, we have to concentrate great 
efforts on developing agriculture. 
  This year is a meaningful year, which marks the 30th 
anniversary of the presentation of the socialist rural theses. 
We should vigorously carry out the struggle to fulfill the 
historic tasks of the rural theses so we can make a new turning 
point in developing our rural economy. To achieve this, we 
should consolidate results of irrigation and electrification in 
rural areas, realize mechanization and scientization at a high 
level, and completely implement the chuche farming method. By 
doing so, we should develop all agricultural sectors, including 
grain production. 
  The working class should produce more farming materials -- 
such as tractors, trucks [chadongcha], modern farm machines, 
chemical fertilizer, and agricultural chemicals -- and send them 
to rural areas. 
  Cooperative farmers and all agricultural working people 
should do farming work in a frugal and tenacious manner with an 
attitude worthy of masters who are responsible for the country's 
rice supply so they can achieve the party's high goal of grain 
production without fail. 
  It is also important for us to direct efforts to develop 
the light industry. We must adopt positive measures to improve 
and reinforce light industry factories, modernize them, and 
increase the production of chemical fibers, synthetic resin, and 
other materials for light industry. In this way, we should 
operate all the light industry factories at full capacity and 
maintain a high and steady rate of production. These are 
important militant tasks for the light industry this year. 
  The heavy industry, by thoroughly carrying out militant 
tasks 
arising before them, must produce various kinds of consumer 
goods in large quantities, increase their variety, and improve 
their quality radically. 
  Increasing foreign trade is one of our important tasks. In 
order to adapt foreign trade to the changed circumstances and 
develop it, we must cultivate new foreign markets in every 
possible way and build up an unquestionable reputation. We must 
strengthen the bases for the production of export goods in many 
sectors of the national economy, increase their production, and 
improve their quality. All sectors and regions must further 
boost exports by exploring and using the resources for exports 
and also develop improvement trade [kagong muyok]. 
  In order to mark this year as a revolutionary upturn in 
construction and revolution, it is very important to give top 
priority to the coal and electric power industries, and rail 
transport--the leading sectors of the national economy--and to 
consistently develop the metal industry. 
  In order to develop agriculture and light industry and to 
accelerate the country's overall economic construction, we must 
put efforts into the coal, electric power, and metal industries 
and find a better solution to the problem of rail transport. 
  In order to triumphantly implement tasks of the economic 
construction to mark this year as a revolutionary upturn in 
construction and revolution, all economic sectors and units of 
the national economy must launch a vigorous campaign for 
increased production and conservation as a mass movement. All 
economic functionaries must organize economic work and direct 
production efficiently in accordance with the party's economic 
strategy. Upholding our party's policy of cultural revolution, 
our intellectuals must strive devotedly to make new advances in 
all fields of developing socialist culture. This year, too, we 
must put efforts into strengthening the country's defense power 
by upholding the leadership of our supreme command leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  What is most important in vigorously pushing ahead with 
construction and revolution is all the more strengthening the 
single-hearted unity among the leader [suryong], the party, and 
the masses and highly displaying the revolutionary spirit of 
self-reliance and hard struggle. 
  Our single-hearted unity is firmly hardened behind the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. All party members and working 
people should uphold, safeguard, and protect the leader 
[yongdoja] with the faithful single-hearted unity, acknowledge 
the justness of the leader's [yongdoja] idea and lines, and 
thoroughly carry them out under any circumstances. By doing so, 
the single-hearted unity of the revolutionary ranks will be 
cemented rock-solid under the leadership of the party and, with 
its might, the cause of the socialism of our own style will be 
vigorously pushed ahead. 
  The spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle is a 
traditional struggle spirit for our people who are doing 
revolutionary work and a revolutionary banner of triumphantly 
building socialism of our own style. "Let us vigorously 
accelerate the general march of socialism in the revolutionary 
spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle," this is the call of 
our party and the militant slogan our people must uphold today. 
Only when we march forward with this slogan can we resolutely 
safeguard and protect the socialism of our own style, smashing 
the imperialists and reactionaries' all sorts of maneuvers of 
obstruction and challenges. We can also solve the problems 
arising in the socialist construction with our own power under 
all difficult conditions. 
  We, as in the days of the great Chollima upsurge after the 
war, should effect a new upsurge in the socialist construction 
by overcoming difficulties, upholding the revolutionary spirit 
of self-reliance and hard struggle. In doing so, we should 
brilliantly adorn this year as a year of revolutionary upturn in 
which our country's socialist construction enters a new 
developing stage.

  [Text] Pyongyang January 26 (KCNA) -- Pyongwon County 
situated in Yoltusamcholli Plain, a grenary on the west coast of 
Korea, is seething with preparations for farming in the New Year. 
  The great leader President Kim Il-song in his New Year 
address defined this year as an agriculture-first year and put 
forward a task to concentrate efforts on the agricultural 
production. 
  Last year the agricultural working people in Pyongwon County 
did farming on a scientific and technical basis as demanded by 
the chuche method of farming, thus producing 40,000 more tons of 
grain than in the preceding year. They are concentrating on 
farming preparations, having set themselves the high goal of 
topping last year's harvest by 30,000 tons this year in which 
falls the 30th anniversary of the publication of the rural 
theses (February 25, 1964). 
  The county overfulfilled its plan of compost production, a 
part of farming preparations for this year, on January 20 and 
has carried most of it out to the paddy and non-paddy fields. 
  All preparations for sowing seed rice on cold-frame beds 
including windbreak fence, humus soil and high-yield seeds have 
been completed in the main on the cooperative farms in the 
county. 
  The repair and readjustment of tractors and 
rice-transplanting, rice seedling-plucking, weeding and other 
farm machines is being hastened at the final stage. 
  The county carried out the cleaning of two hundred odd 
kilometre- long waterways and the repair and readjustment of 
hundreds of water pumps, electric motors, and transformers 20 
days ealier than last year. 
  Meanwhile, the Pyongwon automobile parts factory, the 
Pyongwon garment factory and other factories and enterprises in 
the county have manufactured a number of minor farm implements 
and sent them to cooperative farms. 
  In recent few days the county secured 671,000 pieces of 
minor 
farm implements of 106 kinds and quantities of farming materials 
through an all-people campaign.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 28 (KCNA) -- The feature film 
"Sisters" is showing before full houses in Korea. 
  The film is about sisters who volunteer to be shoe menders 
following their father and devote their youth to the worthy work 
in the spirit of selfless service for the people. The film 
shows an aspect of Korean society where all occupations are 
equally honorable. 
  The leading characters of the film are modeled on Choe 
Kum-hwa and her younger sisters who work at the Welfare Service 
Cooperative in Kwangbok Street, Mangyongdae District, Pyongyang, 
enjoying respect from all people. When they finished the course 
of senior middle school with great ambitions, they were 
recommended for university entrance examinations, but they 
volunteered for the job of shoe mending in order to become true 
servants of the people. 
  In the DPRK, there are many persons who work with pure 
conscience, paying no heed to the rank of job. 
  At the Pyongchon District City Management Office in 
Pyongyang, Choe Chang-ae and 20 other girls work as road 
cleaners. Graduating from senior middle school seven years ago, 
they volunteered for this job. They have since cleaned roads of 
the capital city, drawing affectionate attention of the 
passers-by. 
  The family of Choe Tae-hwa of the Sinuiju Heating Station is 
called a family of town management workers. There are many 
people who sincerely work for society and the people for scores 
of years, not changing their posts, for example, Choe Kyong-hwa 
of the Kanggye Railway Corps and his two sons; Yi Son-ku, a 
heated floor repairer of the Kyongsong County building repair 
station in North Hamgyong Province; Cho Chung-un, a heat service 
worker of the farm attached to the university of the national 
economy; and Yang Pun-yo, a barber of the Pyongchon Welfare 
Service Office in Pyongyang. Their patriotic devotion is based 
on the deep loving care and favours shown by the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il, who always puts the interests of the 
people above all in shaping policies. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il takes care that such persons 
participate 
in national conferences and state functions, and shows deep 
trust and loving care for them, saying that those who devotedly 
work on different jobs of society as faithful servants of the 
people contribute to the fuller display of beautiful relations 
among people across the country. 
  Amid his trust and loving care, a road cleaning girl becomes 
a winner of "Kim Il-song Youth Honour Prize," the highest honour 
to a Korean youth, and ordinary workers enjoy affection and 
respect from all people as merited mender, merited barber and 
merited hairdresser.

  [Text] It has been learned that the two governments of the 
ROK and the United States have shared opinions [chopkun] to 
deploy the missile-intercepting Patriot missiles at U.S. forces 
bases in the ROK in March in case of war [siljon]. A 
high-ranking government official said today that even though 
U.S. President Clinton has not yet made a final approval of the 
deployment of the Patriot missiles on the Korean peninsula, he 
will approve their deployment soon. The official added that 
because our government agrees in principle to deploying the 
Patriot missile in the ROK in case of war, the Patriot missiles 
will be deployed at U.S. forces bases in the ROK around March. 
The official revealed that this time 36 Patriot missiles in all 
will be deployed in order to protect the strategic fortified 
zone of the U.S. forces in the ROK.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 28 (YONHAP) -- The U.S. move for early 
deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea is, in part, aimed 
at putting pressure on the negotiations between North Korea and 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a senior 
government official said Friday. 
  "If the North Korean nuclear problem is solved at an early 
date, I think that the anti-missile missiles will be deployed in 
Japan instead," he said. 
  Seoul and Washington agreed to deploy Patriot missile 
batteries at U.S. Army bases in South Korea in March, he said. 
  "U.S. President Clinton has not given final approval for the 
deployment of Patriot missiles, but I guess that sooner or later 
he will approve it," he said. "The South Korean Government 
agrees to the deployment in principle and the intercepter 
missiles will be deployed at the bases of U.S. Forces here in 
March or April at the latest. The number of Patriot missiles to 
be deployed here is 36. They are for protection of strategic 
points of U.S. Forces in South Korea rather than for defense of 
overpopulated areas including Seoul and the metropolitan area." 
  Deployment of Patriots on the Korean peninsula is the first 
step in establishing the theater missile defense (TMD) system, 
which the U.S. Government is pushing for on a long-term basis. 
  Washington confirmed Wednesday it was considering deployment 
of Patriot missiles in South Korea to defend its ally against 
North Korean attack. 
  Gen. Gary Luck, commander of U.S. Forces in Korea, requested 
deployment of Patriot missiles late last year to prepare against 
Scud missile attacks by North Korea.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 28 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government has expressed concern to the United States about an 
atmosphere being fostered to give the impression that "tension 
is building up on the Korean peninsula," a senior Foreign 
Ministry official said on Friday. The official said the 
worrisome air is being fed by the recent wholesale report by the 
American press of a U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles in 
Korea, the dispatch of a U.S. intelligence support team to 
Korea and the introduction of Apache helicopters by the U.S. 
forces in Korea. 
  "The government has expressed to the United States the wish 
that U.S. military authorities will restrain themselves from 
leaking such information," he said. 
  The official said the deployment of Patriot missiles was 
first requested by the commander of the U.S. forces in Korea to 
President Bill Clinton toward the end of last year as part of 
steps to beef up his command's conventional strength. 
  "Presently it is in the stage of being affirmatively 
reviewed 
and it would take several months before they are actually 
operationally deployed," the official said. He added that the 
introduction of Patriots missile will have no effect on the 
North Korean nuclear issues. 
  As for Apache helicopters, the official said the issue is by 
no means anything new. "Their introduction was decided on in 
the late 1980s," he said. 
  Regarding the intelligence support team, the official said 
it 
is true that the U.S.'s DIA has sent a state intelligence 
support team of five to six men to Seoul. But, he said, their 
tour is a routine mission designed to see if 
intelligence-gathering programs are going on alright. 
  "Their stay here does not mean that the U.S. intelligence 
team here has been reinforced," said the official. "They will 
leave Korea before long."

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular newspapers on 28 
January carry articles and editorials on the pending U.S.-ROK 
plan to deploy Patriot missiles and other new weapons on the 
peninsula. 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 1 a 400-word report 
from Washingon in connection with a U.S. plan to replace the 
existing Cobra helicopters deployed in South Korea with new 
Apache helicopters and to send an aircraft carrier to South 
Korea in addition to deploying Patriot missiles. The report, 
quoting THE WASHINGTON POST dated 27 January, notes the Clinton 
administration's plan to replace the existing Cobra helicopter 
unit deployed in South Korea with two new-type Apache helicopter 
battalions. 
  The report also quotes THE WASHINGTON POST as reporting that 
"the Clinton administration is ready to approve the plan to 
deploy Patriot missiles to South Korea requested by General Gary 
E. Luck, commander of U.S. forces in Korea, but it is now 
waiting for the ROK Government's final approval." The article 
continues to quote the U.S. paper as reporting that the ROK 
Government worries that the deployment of Patriot missiles 
"would irritate North Korea." 
  The report also quotes THE WASHINGTON TIMES as reporting 
that 
"the U.S. Defense Department is considering deploying an 
aircraft carrier in the waters near the Korean peninsula." The 
article quotes THE WASHINGTON TIMES as reporting that General 
Gary E. Luck requested one Patriot missile battalion which 
consists of "64 launching platforms, 256 Patriot missiles, and 
special radar devices which are capable of tracing several 
targts simultaneously." 
  HANGUK ILBO also carries on page 5 a 500-word article by 
Washington-based correspondent Chong Il-hwa on performance data 
of the Patriot missile and a 500-word article by reporter Yi 
Sang-won on that of North Korea's Nodong-1 long-range missile. 
Noting in detail the formidable performance of the Patriot 
missile as demonstrated during the Gulf war, the article by 
correspondent Chong Il-hwa describes the process of the 
upgrading of the Patriot system. 
  The article by reporter Yi Sang-won notes that North Korea's 
Nodong-1 missile was reportedly developed from the former Soviet 
Union's surface-to-surface Scud missile developed in the 1980's 
and that it is reportedly now deployed for use in an actual war. 
The article notes the performance of the Nodong-1 missile, 
including its size and range, adding that North Korea is 
reported "to possess 12 to 18 Nodong-1 missiles at present." The 
article also cites that the Nodong-2 missile is now in the 
developmental stage. 
  HANGUK ILBO carries on page 7 an 800-word article by 
Washington-based correspondent Chong Chin-sok on the reasons for 
the pending U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK. 
Noting the recent "hardline" moves by the U.S. Government in 
connection with the North Korean nuclear issue such as the 
pending U.S. plan to deploy the Patriot missile to the ROK, the 
CIA director's secret visit to Seoul, and U.S. Government 
officials' strong-worded remarks on the North Korean nuclear 
issue, the article says: "People hold that these moves are 
"probably either a sort of nuclear negotiation card to apply 
pressure on North Korea or a political card for U.S. domestic 
purposes." The article says, however, the fact that the 
hardline moves against North Korea have been led by the 
Department of Defense and the CIA suggests that they are aimed 
at warning North Korea. 
  The article notes different approaches between the U.S. 
Department of Defense and the CIA and the Department of State in 
dealing with North Korea regarding the nuclear issue. The 
article concludes that the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles 
to South Korea can be interpreted as a result of the hawkish 
line led by the Department of Defense and the CIA. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 a 600-word 
editorial on the pending plan to deploy Patriot missiles to the 
ROK under the title "New Arrangement of the Situation on the 
Korean Peninsula." Saying that the plan to deploy the Patriot 
missile can be considered prior preparations taken in 
consideration of the start of the UN sanctions against North 
Korea, the article notes North Korea's protracted delaying 
tactics in the negotiations with the International Atomic Energy 
Agency and the United States. The article also notes the recent 
reports by Russian nuclear experts about the possibility of 
North Korea possessing one to two nuclear bombs, the CIA 
director's secret visit to Seoul, and the deployment of a "U.S. 
national intelligence support team" in the ROK, and says that 
these moves show that "a new move for arranging the situation on 
the Korean peninsula in connection with the North Korean nuclear 
issue is in progress." 
  The editorial continues: "In particular, the deployment of 
Patriot missiles to South Korea will bring a big change to the 
military situation of the Korean peninsula, regardless of 
whether it is intended to cope with the North Korean troops 
concentrated along the DMZ, whether it is a prior step in taking 
sanctions against North Korea, or whether it is 'a sophisticated 
tactic to sell' Patriot missles to the ROK." The article 
concludes by stressing the need for our government to properly 
deal with the changing situation of the Korean peninsula. 
  TONG-A ILBO also carries on page 4 a 1,000-word article by 
reporter Kim Chae-hong. The article notes that "the U.S. plan to 
deploy Patriot missiles in the ROK can be considered to be an 
expression of the strong will of the United States to cope with 
possible North Korean provocation, but the ROK worries that the 
presence of Patriot missiles on the Korean peninsula would 
irritate North Korea and have a serious effect on the nuclear 
negotiations with North Korea." 
  The article is followed by a long explanation of the 
technological aspect of the Patriot missile, including its 
performance demonstrated during the Gulf war. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 a 900-word 
editorial entitled "The Merit of Patriot Deployment." The 
editorial notes North Korea's persistent refusal to comply with 
the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] demands for the 
inspection of its nuclear sites, increasing the likelihood of UN 
military and economic sanctions on North Korea, and says, "The 
U.S. plan to transfer to and deploy the anti-missile Patriot 
missiles to the ROK shows that the U.S. warning to North Korea 
in connection with the nuclear issue is becoming a reality. The 
ROK Government is inclined to accept the U.S. plan." The 
editorial then notes the deployment of Patriot missiles to the 
ROK has been considered for some time to augment the defense 
capability of the U.S. ground forces in the ROK to effectively 
counter the North's surprise attack, irrespective of the nuclear 
issue, in view of the difficulty of U.S. reinforcement forces in 
arriving in the ROK swiftly enough in case of a North Korean 
surprise attack. The editorial then notes the doubts about the 
performance of the Patriot missile which was used during the 
Gulf war, citing the U.S. accounting audit personnel's 
revelation that the Patriot's capability of destroying the 
enemy's missile warheads was only nine percent. The editorial 
goes on to note the insufficient performance of the Patriot, 
namely, its fragments falling out up to one kilometer diameter, 
increasing danger for civilian casualties, and shrinking 
performance in mountainous areas like the Korean peninsula. The 
editorial concludes by noting, "It is, therefore, effective for 
combat purposes to deploy the much-improved second stage Patriot 
missiles. The deployment of the type which was used during the 
Gulf war could give an impression that the United States is 
disposing of old stock. The deployment of the Patriot should 
not be viewed only from the perspective of creating tension 
between the North and the South." 
  KYONGHYANG SINMUN on page 4 carries a 900-word article by 
New 
York-based correspondent Pak Su-man and reporter Song Yong-sung 
entitled "What Was the Background for the Deployment of the 
Patriot in the ROK?--Pros And Cons in the ROK and the United 
States." The article notes, "The U.S. Government plan to deploy 
Patriot missiles to the ROK implies that the United States is 
preparing for the potential circumstances where not only 
economic but also military sanctions will have to be taken in 
case of a failure to bring about the settlement of the North 
Korean nuclear issue." The article notes the view of U.S. 
intelligence agencies that the Patriot will be capable of 
protecting the targets of a preemptive North Korean missile 
attack on the ROK. The article notes some ROK Government 
officials show an unwelcome reaction to the U.S. plan but 
refrain from explicitly commenting on it under the weight of the 
cause of building up the combat capability of the ROK-U.S. 
combined forces. The article also notes, "Some are of the 
opinion that if the nuclear inspection negotiation fails and the 
situation aggravates leading to sanctions on the North, North 
Korea may well be angered by it, and that it will then be 
necessary for the U.S. Forces in the ROK to be equipped with an 
augmented combat capability to cope with such a situation." The 
article then notes insufficient performance of the Patriot and 
some ROK Government officials' view that the deployment of the 
Patriot is ill-timed for the North Korea-U.S. negotiation on the 
nuclear issue. 
  KYONGHYANG SINMUN on page 4 also carries an 800-word article 
by reporter Choe Chung-ung on the performance of the Patriot 
missile which notes that the Patriot intercepted and shot down 
50 to 60 percent of the Scud missiles during the Gulf war and 
the "shortcomings" of the Patriot, namely, "its enormous price, 
namely $120 million per unit; the extensive fallout of its 
fragments which can cause heavy human casualties and material 
loss; and the helpless situation in case the enemy fires the 
missile with a chemical warhead." 
  KYONGHYANG SINMUN on page 4 also carries a 200-word article 
by ?eporter Pak Hun-sin in the column "Reporter's Bench." The 
article notes the opposition Democratic Party's [DP] position 
concerning the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK, 
and refers to remarks by DPR CHairman Yi Ki-taek: "The 
deployment of Patriot missiles to the ROK at this critical 
juncture when negotiations for nuclear inspection is underway 
can adversely affect the inter-Korean dialogue although it is 
said to be for defensive purposes." 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN on pag? 4 carries a 
1,000-word article by Washington-based correspondent Yi 
Kyong-hyong entitled "The Meaning of the U.S. Plan To Deploy 
Patriot Missiles--To Provide a Shield for the ROK Defenseless to 
Scud Gttack." The article says, "The U.S. plan to deploy 
Patriot missiles to the ROK seems to be prompted by the sheer 
defensive purposes in preparation for a North Korean Scud 
missile attack." The article stresses that the Patriot 
deployment is far from designed to pose a new threat to North 
Korea, and notes, "Nevertheless, the prevailing view about the 
plan to deploy =atriot missiles is that it will serve as 
important leverage to pressure North Korea into an early 
acceptance of nuclear inspection." The article goes on to note, 
"The deployment of the Patriot missiles in he ROK seems to be 
the U.S. measure to demonstrate its resolute will to defend the 
ROK." 
  SEOUL SINMUN on page 7 carries an 800-word report compiled 
from AP, YONHAP reports from Washington entitled "Patriot's 
Interception Capability `Unsatisfactory.'" The report says, 
"The Patriot intercept missile, which the United States is 
planning to deploy to the ROK, is a little improved from the 
type used in the Gulf war but is reported to have only a limited 
capability against North Korean missile attack. The PAC II-type 
Patriot, which is expected to be deployed in the ROK, was used 
by Saudi Arabia and Israel in 1991, and there is controversy 
over its capability to hit the target. Political analyst (Baker 
Spring) of the Heritage Foundation said that the United States 
is now developing the PAC III, and the missile to be deployed in 
the ROK will be the PAC II." The article concludes by quoting a 
remark by a U.S. military strategist that the U.S. plan to 
deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK is made more from political 
considerations than from military considerations. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 1 a 650-word 
article by Washington-based correspondent Chong Hae-yong citing 
the 27 January WASHINGTON TIMES article which said that "To cope 
with the possibility of North Korea's missile attack, the 
Clinton Administration plans to deploy 256 Patriot missiles (64 
launching pads) and special radar equipment capable of chasing 
and intercepting several targets at the same time to the ROK." 
The article also quotes THE WASHINGTON TIMES as reporting that 
"the plan to deploy the Patriot missiles in the ROK is an 
important sign that the United States is concerned about the 
failure of negotiations over nuclear inspections of North 
Korea's facilities." The article also quotes THE WASHINGTON 
POST report on the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles in major 
ports and airports of the ROK and on U.S. plans to sell the 
Patriot missiles to the ROK. The article concludes by citing 
WASHINGTON POST as saying that "the U.S. Government is promoting 
the plan to station two Apache helicopter battalions in the ROK 
which will replace the existing Cobra helicopter battalion." 
  The CHOSON ILBO also carries an 800-word article by reporter 
Pak Tu-sik on page 5 about the ROK Government's reaction to the 
deployment of the Patriot missiles in Korea, and notes that all 
along, the ROK and U.S. Governments have stressed "deployment of 
the Patriot missiles only in consideration of security and 
technology." The article says that "such an explanation by both 
the ROK and U.S. Governments is aimed at preventing the 
introduction of Patriot missiles from having a bad effect on 
negotiations on North Korea's nuclear issue." Then the article 
points out the possibility that "the deployment of the Patriot 
missiles may give North Korea, which has currently been driven 
to a corner, a pretext for frustrating negotiations with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]." The article notes 
the unfavorable reaction of our government's working-level 
officials involved in negotiations with North Korea. The article 
then notes prevailing opinion that "beginning with the 
deployment of the Patriot missiles, the United States-led 
regional missile defense system--`TMD-Theater Missile 
Defense'--should be more systematically reviewed," and also 
notes that "under the present circumstances with North Korea's 
missile threat, the introduction of weapons should be reviewed 
in terms of a middle and long-term plan, rather than a 
short-term plan." 
  CHOSON ILBO also carries on page 5 an 800-word article by 
Kyong Yong-won analyzing the efficiency of the deployment of 
Patriot missiles to the ROK, in which he notes the Patriot 
missiles' defects the low accuracy rate of 50-60 percent and the 
nine-percent destruction rate. Then the article says that "even 
if the Patriot missile's defects are remedied, it is doubtful 
whether the Patriot missiles will be efficient considering the 
many stumbling blocks, including high mountains, that exist on 
Korean terrain." Comparing Korean terrain with the Gulf war 
example, the article points out that although it took 20-30 
minutes for a Scud missile launched in Iraq to reach a target, 
"the early-warning time is no less than three or five minutes" 
on the Korean peninsula because the battlefield depth is only 40 
km. The article says that assuming that the Patriot missiles 
take three to five minutes to chase and intercept a target, "the 
Patriot missiles have almost no time to intercept a Scud missile 
once it is launched in North Korea." 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries on page 4 a 
1,400-word article by Washington-based correspondent Chong 
Yon-chu which cites NEW YORK TIMES and AP news agency reports on 
U.S. plans to deploy the Patriot missile system to the ROK. 
Quoting U.S. officials as saying that "because the Patriot 
missiles are purely defensive, their deployment in the ROK will 
not aggravate tension on the Korean peninsula," the article says 
that "even though the Patriot missiles are defensive, their 
deployment is sure to strengthen the military power of the ROK 
Army and the U.S. forces in Korea. It is difficult to predict 
what reaction North Korea will show and what effect the 
deployment of the Patriot missiles will have on negotiations 
over the nuclear issue." After noting that some U.S. State 
Department officials were concerned over the bad effect the 
Patriot missiles might have on nuclear negotiations with North 
Korea, the article says that "considering the situation of the 
Korean peninsula, the weapons for `defense' may be turned into 
weapons of `political offensive' which cause crises and 
tension." The article concludes: "Generally speaking, the 
deployment of Patriot missiles will have a bad effect on the 
solution of North Korea's nuclear issue and on reconciliation 
trends on the Korean peninsula. In this connection, some 
analysts point out that North Korea should also be to blame for 
dallying too long in the political game of negotiations with the 
United States and the IAEA. If there had been more rapid 
progress in nuclear negotiations and a foundation for resolving 
the nuclear issue had been laid, the military hard liners within 
the U.S. Administration would not have had an excuse for a 
hard-line policy." 
  The HANGYORE SINMUN also carries on page 4 a 600-word 
article 
by Yi Sang-ki detailing the capabilities of the Patriot missiles 
which he says are commonly known as the "missile that catches 
missiles." After noting that hundreds of Patriot missiles have 
been deployed in the U.S. Continent, Germany, Netherlands, 
Italy, Saudi Arabia, and Israel, the article says "the supreme 
speed of the Patriot Missiles is Mach 6 and their firing range 
is known to be over 150 km. Their effective range is 70 km and 
it takes the Patriot missiles three minutes to launch and 
intercept the enemy's target." The article notes that Patriot 
missiles were on display at the U.S. Suwon Base during the Ulchi 
Focus exercise in 1992 and during the Team Spirit exercise last 
year, and points out that: "There are some that say that the 
Patriot missiles are not suitable for Korean terrain because, 
for starters, the Patriot missiles are too expensive with the 
price of each launching pad amounting to $150 million; second, 
considering that Korean terrain has short battlefield depth, the 
efficiency of Patriot missiles is doubted." The article says: 
"Unlike the depth of the battlefield in the Gulf War, Seoul is 
less than 40 km away from the Armistice Line, so the accuracy of 
the missile's air interception rate will not reach that of the 
Gulf War. In addition, contrary to U.S. press reports of the 
Patriot missile's 80-90 percent target-hitting rate, its 
target-hitting rate is in fact only about 50-60 percent." The 
article concludes by quoting general opinion within the army 
that "considering economic and accuracy conditions, the Patriot 
missiles will provide nothing more than mental stability when 
facing a southward attack." 
  The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean publishes on page 2 a 
500-word article by Washington-based reporter Chin Chang-ho 
noting the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles and a new-type 
Apache helicopter unit to South Korea and to send an aircraft 
carrier to the waters near the Korean peninsula, reporting that 
these moves suggest that the U.S. policy toward North Korea is 
moving in a hard-line direction. The article quotes THE 
WASHINGTON POST and THE WASHINGTON TIMES as reporting that the 
United States will replace the Cobra helicopters with new-type 
Apache helicopters and send an aircraft carrier to the waters 
near the Korean peninsula in an effort to strengthen the combat 
capabilities of the U.S. Forces in South Korea. The article 
also reports a Defense Department spokesman described the 
performance of the Patriot missiles at a briefing session. 
  CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 a 1,500-word 
article by reporter Kang Yong-chin on the meaning and background 
of the U.S. plan to strengthen U.S. Forces stationed in South 
Korea. Noting the background of the recent hard-line attitude 
toward North Korea by the hawkish group led by the Department of 
Defense and CIA in connection with the negotiations with North 
Korea the article cites: "After all, the U.S. State Department, 
which has insisted on the need to continue nuclear negotiations 
with North Korea has become to realize that its concessions to 
North Korea have been fruitless." 
  Noting the position of the ROK Government, which has assumed 
a prudent attitude toward the hard-line group led by the U.S. 
Department of Defense and CIA, the article concludes that the 
United States will continue to maintain a hard-line attitude 
toward North Korea "through the strengthening of its defense 
capability in South Korea in a bid to apply pressure on North 
Korea." 
  CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 a 1,000-word 
article by reporter Pak Ui-chun describing in detail the 
background of the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles to the 
ROK. The article reports that deployment of Patriot missiles, 
though it will contribute to strengthening the combat 
capabilities of the U.S. Forces stationed in South Korea, will 
have a serious effect on alleviating tensions on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  The article also quotes leaders of the opposition DP, 
including Chairman Yi Ki-taek, as expressing worries over the 
possible negative effect of the deployment of Patriot missiles 
on North-South dialogue and on easing tension on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  The article concludes that the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot 
missiles to the ROK should be prudently reviewed, not only 
because it would dampen the negotiations of the North Korean 
nuclear issue, but also because it would create an arms race on 
the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 28 (YONHAP) -- About 100 drivers of 
"Arirang Taxis" serving American military people on a contract, 
demonstrated near the Yongsang U.S. military reservation Friday 
afternoon in protest against the arrest of a fellow driver by an 
American M.P. The demonstration lasted about one and half an 
hours at Gate No. 1 of the Eighth U.S. Army compound. 
Protesting drivers said that Chong Yang-han, age 48, was 
driving his "Arirang Taxi" along a back alley near Hannam 
Village, Hannam-dong around 11:20 a.m. when an American M.P., 
identified only as Cpl. Harrison, who was following the taxi in 
his patrol car, stopped Chong. An argument ensued between the 
two over whether Chong violated a lane. In the quarrel, 
Harrison all of a sudden handcuffed Chong and took him into the 
Eighth Army compound, the drivers said. Learning of the 
incident, about 100 "Arirang" drivers drove their taxis to the 
gate to stage the protest until Chong was set free around 3 p.m.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 28 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Canada 
have agreed to establish an informal working group to study ways 
to cooperate in coping bilaterally or multilaterally with 
rapidly changing world economic circumstances, the Foreign 
Ministry said Friday. The joint Korea-Canada Economic 
Committee, in its second meeting, Wednesday and Thursday 
discussed ways to cooperate in several economic groupings, 
including the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. 
  Son Chun-yong, assistant foreign minister for economic 
affairs, headed the Korean committee members, and Howard 
Balloch, assistant deputy minister for Asia and Pacific in the 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, led the 
Canadian side. The Canadians said they will actively study ways 
to extend the period of the Generalized System of Preferences 
(GSP) for Korea. They also said that the reduction of tariffs 
for Korean-made automobile parts decided early this month was 
not temporary and Canada will deal with anti-dumping regulations 
on some Korean goods fairly. 
  Balloch expressed an interest in the opening of Korea's 
agricultural market and said that Canada will actively study 
Korean demands, including exemption of short-stay visas and 
shortening the period for issuing visas to resident businessmen. 
  Son explained the results of the Uruguay Round negotiations, 
plans for implementation of the results, the opening of Korea's 
financial market and efforts to improve the environment for 
foreign investment before asking for increased Canadian 
investment in Korea. 
  The next committee meeting will be in Canada in the first 
quarter of 1995.

<F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>
  [Text] Australia's Prime Minister Paul Keating managed to 
minimize the changes to his ministry in a reshuffle forced by 
the shock resignation of his industry minister last weekend. 
Assuming the industry mantle is Senator Peter Cook, trade 
minister for almost a year who has steered the country's trade 
interests through a tough 12 months while heading the Cairns 
Group of free trading agricultural nations. But the real winner 
is the quiet but highly respected and capable Senator Bob 
McMullan, who has been elevated to the trade portfolio. 
Australian Affairs Correspondent Linda Mottram reports on the 
changes: 
  [Begin Mottram recording] When former Industry Minister Alan 
Griffiths fell on his sword of alleged financial impropriety in 
his electorate office, he created a headache for the prime 
minister, forcing the second ministerial reshuffle since 
December when then-treasurer John Dawkins unexpectedly stepped 
down under somewhat different circumstances. The fact of that 
earlier reshuffle made these changes more difficult with the 
number of ministers who were potential candidates for industry 
only just settling into their new portfolios. But after a week 
turning over the option, Paul Keating has found a formula with a 
minimum of change but that rewards good service. Peter Cook 
will take on the industry portfolio with his first big job, the 
delivery of a new industry policy statement due in April. 
Senator Cook is known to have impressed the prime minister with 
his 10-month stewardship of the trade portfolio, a period 
featuring difficult talks with the United States over the use of 
farm export subsidy that also saw the ushering in of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, and continuing evolution 
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, APEC, and the 
long-awaited successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the 
GATT trade liberalization talks. And that service, plus Peter 
Cook's earlier ministries, including resources and industrial 
relations, position him well for his new job of industry, 
technology, and regional development. 
  The biggest elevation, though, is for Senator Bob McMullan, 
long overlooked for ministries during the years of Bob Hawke's 
leadership largely because of his non-aligned status amidst the 
Labor Party's rigid factional system. A highly capable 
performer in parliament since the late 1980's, his first full 
ministry came after the March election last year -- the arts and 
administrative services portfolio with cabinet status. Now, 
Senator McMullan shifts up to trade, giving his beloved arts 
portfolio to the existing communications minister, Michael Lee. 
But Senator McMullan will be able to deliver his culture 
statement -- a pet project -- due in weeks. 
  The changes end a week of uncertainty in the Keating 
Government and give the prime minister a full complement of 
ministers to handle the resumption of parliamentary sittings 
next week. But in overall numbers, the ministry is one down, 
that is, the prime minister has left a vacancy -- should Alan 
Griffiths be cleared of impropriety as he insists he will be -- 
and should he be returned to the front bench. If that happens, 
the ambitious Mr. Griffiths will be picking up his career at a 
level junior to the status he just voluntarily abandoned. He 
would likely take on the administrative services portfolio. His 
future, though, is in the hands of two inquiries and then in the 
hands of his colleagues who must decide who they want as their 
ministers. [end recording]

  [Text] Mexican Consulate representatives in Sydney say 
they are baffled by a firebombing at their premises in 
Edgecliff. Cathy Kellos reports the Mexican consul general has 
released a statement on the incident. The statement reads that: 
  [Begin Kellos recording] Judging from the graffiti and 
posters left after the overnight attack, those responsible must 
have acted in solidarity with the indigenous peasant group that 
emerged on New Year's Day in the southern Mexican state of 
Chiapas. But representatives say they are perplexed by the 
incident because the Mexican Government is taking measures to 
find a peaceful solution to the situation. Among the steps 
taken: The president of Mexico has decreed a unilateral 
cease-fire and has appointed a commissioner to negotiate with 
the group. The consulate says it has not received any threat or 
communication by anyone prior to this incident. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Wina Domphananadon: "Visit To Manerplaw Camp To </F>
Celebrate General Bo Mya's 67th Birthday"] 
  [Text] The Moei and Salween rivers dividing Thailand and 
Burma from Tak to Mae Hong Son Provinces were full of activity. 
The noise of long-tail boats was deafening as boat after boat 
skimmed along the rivers while passengers chatted away. 
  This was not a normal scene. During the war when there were 
only the sound of gunfire and the smell of gunsmoke not many 
people dared to use the rivers. 
  However, since the Burmese Government ceased military 
operations in the Karen State in April 1992, the atmosphere has 
changed and more people have since traveled this route. 
  These extraordinary events took place as the Karens living 
on 
the banks of the Moei and Salween rivers came to the Manerplaw 
Headquarters of General Bo Mya, president of the Karen National 
Union [KNU], located on the banks of the Moei river about 50 km 
north of Ban Mae Tawo pier in Tha Song Yang District, Tak 
Province. Many also came by foot from across nearby mountains. 
  They Karens came to celebrate the 67th birthday of Gen. Bo 
Mya on 20 January, to express their loyalty, and convey their 
greetings to the man they regard as the leader of the Karens. A 
minority group, the Karens have waged a protracted struggle 
against the Burmese Government, and every year they have only 
few days for such joyous activities. 
  The grounds of the Manerplaw camp was thronged by people 
from 
the evening of 19 January, the first day of the celebrations. 
There were 11 folk performances, most of which were meant to 
arouse patriotic feelings. The performers totaled in the 
hundreds, and those who satisfied the organizing committee would 
receive several thousand bahts in reward. 
  Lasting over half the night, the performances were a prelude 
to the celebrations. 
  The next morning before the fog cleared, thousands were 
already gathered in great anticipation. Gen. Bo Mya and his 
family sat on the stage waiting for the ceremonies to take place. 
  A Buddhist ceremony performed by about 10 Karen monks 
started 
off the occasion. Then, Karen student leaders of various levels 
sang greetings to the melodies of church hymns, praising the 
revered leader. 
  Then, for almost an hour, Karens representatives who lived 
too far away to attend the celebrations, read their greetings. 
  Next came a party representing several Karen groups under 
the 
control of Gen. Bo Mya along the Thai-Burmese border from Mae 
Hong Son to Ranong Provinces. They included the All Burma 
Student Democratic Front [ABSDF] representatives from Dawngwin 
camp, Karen alliance groups, and even Thai logging firm 
operators. They lined up to hand gifts to Gen. Bo Mya. 
  As with earlier years, most of the gifts were blankets, a 
necessity not only for Gen. Bo Mya but for Karen soldiers in the 
field as well. Gen. Bo Mya then blew out the candles and cut 
the big cake given by his men. 
  Next came what all Karens eagerly waited for -- Gen. Bo 
Mya's address. The address in Karen was translated into English 
sentence by sentence. His address seemed to reflect his 
sincerity and long experience of the struggle. It was full of 
substance and determination and was punctuated by occasional 
applause from the big audience. 
  That concluded the official ceremonies. 
  In the afternoon, attendants gathered on the edge of the 
field which was used as a boxing ring. Boxing is the favorite 
sport of Karens of all ages, and all of them waited eagerly for 
the event. The event began with fights between volunteers, who 
were picked by referees on the spot. Some boxers were only 
about 100 cm tall. Foreign visitors were surprised by the 
enthusiasm of these boxers. There were many willing boxers and 
all the referee had to do was to give the signal. 
  There was no fixed length for a match. The pair displaying 
skills that pleased the cheering crowd would be allowed to fight 
longer. The boxers fought viciously. There would be two 
referees in each match to ensure that a boxer would not be taken 
unfair advantage by the other. Some matches were so exciting 
that they had to be interrupted for other matches before 
resuming. 
  After the match, each boxer would be given bunches of 
20-baht 
and 100-baht notes by the referees as a prize. 
  As dusk approached, the audience began to disperse and the 
boxing matches, which evidently projected a quality of the 
Karens, ended. This quality is their fighting and sporting 
spirit. They love boxing and they do not bet on matches. There 
were no shouts offering odds during matches as would be the case 
in Thailand. Gambling and alcohol are strictly prohibited in 
Karen land. 
  Karens participants of the celebrations waited for the night 
of 20 January, for "Li Ke Karen" [Karen folk play] which was 
held on the same field. These people thoroughly enjoyed each 
other and the play. The next day everything returned to normal 
at Manerplaw camp, and those who came from afar returned to 
their homes, while camp members would resume their normal daily 
chores. 
  Many agreed that the attendance at this year's celebrations 
was smaller than previous years. Not many dared to offer 
reasons, but some claimed that Gen. Bo Mya's influence had 
declined and so he had less interests to be exploited. In any 
event, this seemed to be the current situation with the Karen 
general. 
  In mid 1993 there were attempts by certain Burmese minority 
groups, such as the Kachin, the Wa, Shan, Pa-O, and other 
groups, to seek a cease-fire with the Burmese Government. There 
was a report that the Karens and the Burmese Government would 
negotiate a cease-fire in early 1994. The world is following 
the outcome of this event closely. 
  However, Gen. Bo Mya recently said: "The negotiations 
between 
the Karen and the Burmese did not take place. If a negotiation 
is to take place, it is likely to be held in a third country, 
possibly Thailand. First the Thai Government will have to give 
its consent. The Karens have not approached the Thai Government 
on this matter. The KNU will have to hold internal consultations 
on the timing of the negotiation. 
  "On our part, we will negotiate with the Burmese military 
government, but the negotiations must cover every political 
field, such as freedom and the liberty of minority citizens and 
political issues. We feel that there must be negotiations with 
every group, including the revolutionary group and the Burmese 
people. This will result in peace in the country. If the 
negotiation involves only the KNU, peace will probably not 
materialize nationwide." 
  Regarding the attempt by certain minority groups to seek 
negotiations with the Burmese Government: 
  "Those groups do not uphold correct political principle. 
Their action amounts to a surrender or a subjugation of 
themselves to the enemy without undertaking political 
negotiations to resolve the people's problems. The minority 
groups that participated in cease-fire negotiations are groups 
that have no political ideology." 
  On this, Nai Aung, president of the ABSDF, whose command 
post 
is located on the bank of Salween river, opposite Ban Mae 
Samlap, Sop Moei subdistrict, Mae Hong Son, and who participated 
in the celebrations of Gen. Bo Mya's birthday, said: 
  "The Burmese military government will negotiate with each of 
the minority groups in the format that it wants. This is no 
problem, providing that the negotiations deal with solutions to 
the political problems, to freedom and liberty problems, and 
diversities among the different minority groups. If these 
negotiations succeed, other minority groups will benefit as 
well. In any event, the students have not negotiated with the 
Burmese Government." 
  An issue that occupied great attention was the projected 
construction of dams on the Moei and Salween rivers by the Thai 
and Burmese Governments. The project will result in the areas 
on both banks of the rivers being submerged. The Karen forces 
and the student group occupy the Burmese side of the rivers. 
  On this issue, Gen. Bo Mya clearly opposed the project. 
  He said: "The construction of the dams will definitely 
affect 
us. Farmland will be lost. Our people will suffer. Most 
importantly, our areas of operation will be curtailed. So far, 
we have written to the World Bank and the free governments to 
help them understand the picture so that they will not support 
the project." 
  What if this effort fails? 
  "If our appeals fail we will resort to violence to stop it." 
  Meanwhile, Nai Aung said: 
  "We do not support dams on the Moei and Salween rivers. The 
student group will write their about the opposition to the dams 
to international organizations, environmental conservation 
groups, and international humanitarian groups to inform them 
that the project will destroy natural resources and human 
rights. Thailand may want to solve its domestic energy problem, 
but we have our problems too." 
  "If our opposition does not succeed, we will resort to 
violence in our territory to block the construction. That is 
our last resort." 
  Now that the direction and objectives of the two individuals 
who are allied in the struggle against the Burmese Govrnment are 
the same, the situation in the Salween river along the 
Thai-Burmese border is clear. Whether they choose peace or 
violence will depend on the future conditions.

privatization. 
  Speaking at a news conference at the end of his four-day

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jan 27 (OANA-ANTARA) -- A three-day 
meeting on Ligitan and Sipadan islands started here on Wednesday 
with Indonesia urging Malaysia to respond to its arguments to 
expedite the settlement of dispute over ownership of the two 
tiny islands off Kalimantan. 
  "I hope that the response would be given at today's 
meeting," 
head of the Indonesian delegation Izhar Ibrahim said. 
  At the opening session, the Indonesian delegation also 
expressed the hope that the two countries would agree upon 
several principles of settlement which would serve as the basis 
for the settlement of the dispute in the next negotiations. 
  Izhar reminded the participants of Indonesia's stance on the 
status of the islands adopted at the first meeting in July 1992 
when the Indonesian delegation submitted documents and maps to 
back Jakarta's claim over the two islands and the Malaysian 
delegation put forward a memorandum along with supporting 
documents. 
  "The Indonesian Government has replied to the memorandum in 
February, but the Malaysian Government has not yet responded to 
the documents and maps we have submitted to the Malaysian 
delegation," said Izhar, who is the director-general of 
political affairs at the Foreign Ministry. 
  Ahmad Kamil Jaafar, who led the Malaysian delegation said 
the 
dispute over Sipadan and Ligitan was not a matter of determining 
boundaries, but rather it was related to sovereignty which 
should be evidenced with the international law. 
  Kamil, who is secretary-general of Malaysia's Foreign 
Ministry expressed his optimism that the dispute could be 
resolved amicably. 
  The row over Sipadan and Ligitan resurfaced in recent months 
after Malaysia promoted the islands as a tourist attraction, 
which sparked off criticism from the Indonesian authorities. 
  President Suharto and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir 
Mohamed at their meeting in Langkawi, Malaysia, last July agreed 
to solve the dispute over ownership of the islands through 
negotiations. Indonesia's Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said last 
week the dispute was a problem but it did not threaten the 
frienship between the two countces, which are both members of 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. 
  In a reply to newsmen's questions, Kamil said the 
delegations 
of the two countries were expected to enter the stage of 
negotiation at the meeting shortly after they settled problems 
relating to the exchange of documents agreed upon at the 
previous meeting. 
  In a separate occasion, Izhar said the Indonesian Government 
hoped that the meeting would enter the phase of negotiation. 
  The meeting is the second held under the scheme of the 
Indonesia-Malaysia joint working group on Sipadan and Ligitan. 
The working group was established at tha conclusion of the 
first session of the Indonesia-Malaysia joint commission in 
Kuala Lumpur in October 1991, in which the two countries agreed 
to hold negotiations aimed at solving the 25-year-old dispute.

  [Text] Malaysia has reacted positively to Indonesia's 
desire to settle the dispute over Sipadan and Ligitan more 
quickly. Izhar Ibrahim, Indonesia's chief delegate to the Kuala 
Lumpur talks on the dispute, said there seemed to be progress in 
the talks because Malaysia had reacted positively to Indonesia's 
hope for a speedier settlement. During the talks, which started 
on Wednesday, Malaysia also responded to Indonesia's statement 
on the ownership of the islands made during the earlier talks in 
July 1992.

  [Text] His Excellency [H.E.] Hun Sen, second prime minister 
of the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC], recently paid a 
four-day visit to Sihanoukville. Speaking at a get-together 
with city officials, his excellency the second prime minister 
said: We are currently encountering a lot of problems, but this 
is quite normal. Even big, developed, and rich countries -- such 
as Japan, France, and the United States -- have problems. Japan 
is undertaking political reforms, while the United States is 
facing the problems of unemployment, drugs, and AIDS. So every 
country has problems; this is quite normal. 
  We have presented the RGC's working program to the National 
Assembly. It includes the Khmer Rouge issue, which can be 
regarded as a security issue; the problem of unidentified gunmen 
who plunder the people's property; and so on. 
  Different opinions have been put forward on the Khmer Rouge 
problem. Some say force should be used while others advocate a 
peaceful settlement. We really want to use peaceful means; that 
is why we have opened the door for a solution to this problem. 
We have created a working group to interact with Democratic 
Kampuchea's working group. The Khmer Rouge, however, do not 
recognize Samdech Krompreah [Prince Ranariddh] as first prime 
minister of the RGC. In their letters, they always address 
Samdech Krompreah as chairman of FUNCINPEC [National United 
Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative 
Cambodia]. If Khieu Samphan regards Samdech Krompreah as 
chairman of FUNCINPEC and me as vice chairman of the Cambodian 
People's Party [CPP], nothing will be solved. Only the prime 
ministers can give orders regarding military, police, and 
financial matters; no political party chairman can do this. 
  Khieu Samphan demanded that a working group be established, 
but when we sent H.E. Sok An for talks, Khieu Samphan said that 
H.E. Sok An belongs to the CPP working group and refused to 
recognize him. He also demanded the participation of H.E. Son 
Sann. He does not recognize the RGC, but he wants to be a 
minister in that government. The RGC has agreed to allow Khmer 
Rouge leaders to occupy suitable positions, but they have 
refused. When we call for a cease-fire, the Khmer Rouge leaders 
demand that we implement the five points of the cease-fire. We 
do not want war; we want to protect our people from being the 
victims of Khmer Rouge massacres, oppression, and banditry. 
During the celebration of Samdech Krompreah's birthday, the 
Khmer Rouge attacked the Rumchang camp -- FUNCINPEC's command 
headquarters -- killing people indiscriminately. 
  Speaking on behalf of the RGC, we do not want our territory 
divided. The Khmer Rouge have forced the people to pay for 
their actions, to forget what the people can never forget, to do 
something good for those that have mistreated them, and to 
accept unscrupulous individuals assuming power on their behalf. 
  The Khmer Rouge has about 8,000 troops. If we want to attack 
them, we can use our forces. Our country has laws and a 
constitution; the Khmer Rouge should abide by these laws if they 
want to join us. Rebels exist not only in Cambodia but in other 
countries as well. For instance, it took Malaysia many, many 
years to solve their own problem. 
  On the investment issue, H.E. Hun Sen said: We have to 
develop our country successfully. We are now on a stretch of 
road that needs restoration. No country can develop when it 
lacks political stability. For this reason, we should do 
whatever we can to attract foreign investment. If foreigners 
are not allowed to invest, and if people inside the country do 
not dare to produce capital, we will never have an opportunity 
to rebuild our country. If our country lacks foreign 
investment, we can never rebuild our economy and we can never 
use our state budget or state force. Therefore, we should 
restore political stability and allow the people to own land. 
We should never create complicated regulations. We should 
improve the quality of our workers. 
  Concerning the issue of land in Sihanoukville, H.E. Hun Sen 
said: We should clearly divide the city into trade, industrial, 
and tourist zones and zones that can be owned by the people. 
Stakes should not be randomly placed everywhere, as they are 
now.

  [Text] Prince Norodom Sirivut, state minister and minister 
of foreign affairs and international cooperation, on 26 January 
received the ambassadors of the five major international powers 
and members of the conference on Cambodian reconstruction. His 
Excellency [H.E.] (?Yi To-sop), DPRK ambassador extraordinary 
and plenipotentiary as well as dean of the diplomatic corps, was 
also present on the occasion. 
  First, the prince minister briefed his guests on the Kingdom 
of Cambodia's foreign policy. He said that by March at the 
latest, the government will have appointed all of the 
ambassadors it has planned for a number of countries in Asia, 
Europe, America, and Africa. He also said that the Kingdom of 
Cambodia [KOC] will maintain diplomatic relations with those 
countries it has had relations with in the past. 
  He also briefed his guests on the successful visit to the 
PRC 
by the high-ranking Royal Government of Cambodia delegation led 
by Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and H.E. Hun Sen, 
Cambodia's co-prime ministers. During the visit, China granted 
Cambodia an $8.6 million interest-free loan. He praised Chinese 
investment groups for being flexible and accommodating, thus 
facilitating investment. He recalled the assistance the PRC 
provided to the KOC during the 1960's. He welcomed any formula 
for regional, ministerial, or business relations to promote 
economic development. On behalf of the Royal Government and the 
Cambodian people, he expressed his profound thanks to the 
Chinese Government and people for their continued support to 
Cambodia. 
  At the same time, the prince minister highly valued economic 
cooperation with various countries, adding that economic 
cooperation protocols or agreements for concrete implementation 
should be signed at every round of talks. 
  Concerning the security and safety of the diplomatic corps 
and various international organizations in Cambodia, he said 
that their excellencies the co-ministers of the interior and 
national security have already taken concrete measures. For 
example, the Interior and National Security Ministry has already 
established a (?rapid) operation unit to deal with emergencies. 
  The meeting also focused on convening international 
conferences on Cambodian reconstruction. The diplomats 
suggested that Cambodia set out its priorities for the future 
rehabilitation and reconstruction of Cambodia. 
  In conclusion, H.E. (?Yi To-sop) expressed his thanks for 
the 
prince minister's detailed explanation of Cambodia's foreign 
policy.

<F P=106> ["Reply from His Excellency Khieu Samphan, chairman of the </F>
Party of Democratic Kampuchea, to Prince Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh, chairman of the FUNCINPEC party, concerning His 
Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk's five-point initiative"; dated 23 
January -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] After receiving a reply dated 22 January 1994 from 
His Excellency [H.E.] Khieu Samphan, chairman of the Party of 
Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] -- relayed by the PDK representative 
in Phnom Penh -- Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, chairman of 
the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, 
Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] party, instructed 
his representative to call our office. The representative 
informed us of the Phnom Penh side's stance regarding his 
majesty the king's five-point initiative and the organization of 
a technical group. 
  After learning of the telephone call's substance, on 23 
January 1994 H.E. Khieu Samphan instructed the PDK 
representative in Phnom Penh to inform Prince Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh -- through the latter's representative -- of his views 
as follows: 
  1. On behalf of the PDK, H.E. Khieu Samphan expresses his 
pleasure with Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, who has -- on 
behalf of FUNCINPEC -- fully accepted His Majesty King Norodom 
Sihanouk's five-point initiative and agreed that all points 
should be implemented simultaneously. There is also agreement 
on organizing a technical group, which does not need to have a 
name to hold discussions on the king's five-point initiative. 
This move represents a significant step. It will make the 
king's five-point initiative a success in accordance with his 
majesty's lofty desires and the deepest and most sacred 
aspirations of our entire people. 
  2. The PDK sincerely (?hopes) that H.E. Hun Sen and the 
Cambodian People's Party [CPP] will (?join) FUNCINPEC and the 
PDK in supporting his majesty the king's five-point initiative 
and will accept the initiative as the groundwork for the 
technical group's talks, which will be held among Cambodians to 
achieve national reconciliation and unify all national forces 
without discarding any of the national forces. This will allow 
all national forces to unite around the king and the throne to 
resolve the serious national problems and the (?war) we are 
facing. 
  It is worth emphasizing that the PDK neither demands nor 
rejects any person or party. The PDK wants to see all national 
forces -- FUNCINPEC, the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party 
[BLDP], the CPP, the PDK, and other national fores -- join hands 
to achieve genuine national reconciliation, unity, and peace. 
This is in line with the concrete situation, the king's sublime 
desire, and the deepest aspirations of our nation and people. 
The PDK firmly believes that our nation and people demand 
nothing more than this. They want the opportunity to resolve 
the economic problems and living conditions of their families 
and take part in rehabilitating and rebuilding the country 
[words indistinct]. 
  3. It is also worth noting that the CPP and H.E. Hun Sen 
have repeated only three points. Since 7 January 1994, H.E. Hun 
Sen's CPP has demanded that the PDK accept and implement these 
three points before discussing other issues. This constitutes 
an encroachment upon the PDK [words indistinct] the spirit of 
national reconciliation and national unification. (?It is 
hoped) that H.E. Hun Sen and the CPP will review this issue, 
accept the five-point political initiative, and send their 
representatives to participate in the technical group in keeping 
with the spirit jointly agreed upon by Prince Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh and H.E. Khieu Samphan. This will enhance the 
achievement of the king's five-point initiative. 
  4. Along with this, H.E. Khieu Samphan proposes that the 
technical group proceed immediately, composed only of FUNCINPEC 
and PDK representatives. When H.E. Hun Sen and the CPP clearly 
state that they accept the five-point initiative, then CPP 
representatives can be included. 
  It is worth mentioning that the BLDP has also declared its 
support for the king's five-point initiative.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The 1994-95 Budget, the Sixth Development </F>
Program, and the Second Long-Term Development Plan"] 
  [Text] There are certain matters that should be noted in 
the Sixth Development Program (6th Repelita) and the Second 
25-Year Long-Term Development Plan (PJP II). These matters were 
included in the budget speech delivered by President Suharto on 
Thursday [6 January] in Parliament. 
  First, Indonesia's population should reach 258.1 million by 
the end of the year 2019, and by then the country's work force 
should total 147.9 million. This total is based on the 
assumption that the country's population growth rate can be 
reduced to 0.88 percent from the current 1.6 percent by the end 
of the PJP II. 
  Second, Indonesia's annual average economic growth for the 
next 25 years was projected at 7 percent due to the 
ever-increasing population. As an early measure, the target for 
the country's economic growth was projected to stand at an 
annual average of 6.2 percent during the Sixth Five-Year 
Development Program. 
  Third, with the ever-increasing population, it was hoped 
that 
Indonesia's per capita income would reach U.S.$2,631 by the end 
of the Second 25-Year Long-Term Development Plan. This figure 
is calculated on the basis of price consistency during the 
1989-90 period. Nominal prices will definitely be higher. 
  By looking at the three factors, we would like to say that 
it 
was truly a difficult undertaking to draft the 25-year plan. 
Moreover, the plan had to be based on the achievements of the 
First Twenty-Five Year Development Program -- from 1969 to 1994 
and by taking into account the people's capability in ensuring 
continuity in development, the ever-changing and rapid global 
economic situation and the numerous domestic or external 
difficulties that could possibly arise. 
  The government performed an extraordinary service by 
simultaneously presenting all three programs to the parliament 
on Thursday -- the 1994-95 Budget, the Sixth Development 
Program, and the Second 25-Year Long-Term Development Plan. It 
is obvious that the three programs are interlinked. The 1994-95 
budget should be a part of the Sixth Development Program while 
the latter should be a part of the Second 25-Year Long-Term 
Development Plan or PJP II. 
  In drawing up the Sixth Development Program and the PJP II, 
the government definitely focused on growth in the economic 
sectors (agriculture, production industries, non-gas production 
industries, trade, and so on). It may be observed that the 
agriculture sector's role will decline while the role of the 
industries, trade, and services will rise dramatically. 
  However, what we wish to emphasize concerns a 
69-million-person population increase from the current 189.1 
million to 258.1 million by the end of PJP II and the demanding 
responsibility of making preparations toward providing the basic 
needs -- food, basic amenities, and accomodation. The most 
difficult task will be in ensuring adequate food supply. 
  With the present population of 189.1 million, the annual 
rice 
production, which stands at 36 million tons -- including an 
insignificant amount imported as a "security" measure -- food 
sufficiency, particularly rice, is adequate to meet general 
requirements. However, a more precise calculation will be 
needed in trying to meet the requirements of a population of 
258.1 million people by the end of the Second 25-Year Long-Term 
Development Plan. It will be difficult to ensure an adequate 
and consistent rice supply if we take into consideration our 
resources and capabilities. On the other hand, greater 
attention should be given to food sufficiency (which not only 
means rice but also some other kinds of food). 
  We need to consider the importance of importing a greater 
volume of our basic food requirements, including rice. This 
would mean that Indonesia should increase its exports so that 
more than adequate foreign exchange will be available for 
importing food. Indonesia's textile production industries 
should make relative preparations to clothe a population of 
258.1 million people. The industries should have appropriate 
manpower to satisfy the people's ever-changing demands. 
Therefore, there will definitely be an increase in the import 
of raw materials such as cotton. 
  Meanwhile, there will also be an increase in the need for 
construction materials to build houses. Relevant services and 
precise estimates will be needed to eliminate every obstacle in 
the effort to provide housing facilities to people -- regardless 
of which group they belong to. It was felt that, apart from the 
market economy mechanism, other sectors should also participate 
in the construction of houses if we wish to see the lower groups 
possess their own houses. To sum up, the task of ensuring the 
adequacy of food, clothing, and accomodation for the total 
population is a mammoth one even though such efforts were to be 
carried out in stages. 
  The average economic growth for the oncoming 25 years has 
been targeted at an annual rate of 7 percent. This is only a 
slight increase of 0.2 percent if compared to that of the First 
25-Year Long-Term Development Plan. 
  It may be asked why the economic growth rate should not be 
at 
8 or 9 percent. Why shouldn't the growth rate be similar to 
that of Malaysia, Thailand, or South Korea? Probably the 
problem can be traced to the issue of Indonesia's population, 
which now registers at 189.1 million and which could possibly 
rise to 258.1 million by the year 2019. But an opportunity and 
possibility exist for Indonesia's economic growth to attain a 
higher rate after the Sixth Development Program -- an annual 
average growth rate of more than 7 percent during the 25-Year 
Long-Term Development Plan. 
  There is one more issue we would like to raise. An economics 
expert, Dr. Irwan Jaya Azis, stated that the government's 
investment contributions in the 1994-95 budget only represents 
26.8 percent of overall national investments. As such, its 
impact on economic growth is less than that of the 1970's. In 
other words, the attaintment of better economic growth lies in 
the hands of the business sector through their various economic 
and business activities. These activities have no connection 
whatsoever with government funds. 
  During the upcoming 25-year period, the role of the business 
sector will be heavier regarding the development of economic 
growth. That was why the government, in its clarification at 
the Information Department last Wednesday, stressed the need for 
the business sector to conduct its business and economic 
activities smoothly. As such, the government emphasized its 
commitment to more deregulation and debureaucratization, 
continuously eliminating protectionism, and upgrading 
Indonesia's efficiency and competitiveness in the economic field. 
  We truly acknowledge that it will be a very demanding task 
to 
try to achieve all these objectives. The government, as an 
institution, will definitely and undoubtedly face obstacles from 
the business circle and the community. However, we are 
confident of one thing. Only one way remains in trying to 
achieve an annual overall 7 percent economic growth and the per 
capita income of U.S.$2,631 during the upcoming 25-year period 
by the year 2019. Our aspiration to achieve these goals will 
definitely disappear if obstacles that remain in our paths are 
not removed.

<F P=106> [Part one of article by Vu Oanh, member of the Communist </F>
Party of Vietnam Political Bureau: "Developing Combined Forces 
in Mass Motivation Work and Renovating the Work Content and 
Method of the Fatherland Front and Mass Organizations"] 
  [Text] President Ho Chi Minh said: "The national renovation 
and construction work is the duty of all people. We must 
administer social reform, improve the people's life, and apply 
real democracy in society. Mass motivation is the mobilization 
of all people's forces, not leaving anyone out, to create a 
force of the entire people to carry out all necessary works." 
(Ho Chi Minh Collected Works, Volume 5, page 299) The 
undertaking of making the population prosperous, the nation 
strong, and society civilized and just and the protection of 
national independence and sovereignty is the work of all people. 
In understanding this leading idea, at present, we must realize 
that the construction of a law-governed state of the people, by 
the people, and for the people; the economic development and the 
social stabilization; the harmonious combination of a strong 
economic development with the settlement of social issues; the 
combination of economic development with the strengthening of 
national defense and the broadening of foreign relations; the 
development of an internal and external open-door commodity 
economies to integrate into the world economy with different 
economic sectors under the state management; and the 
implementation of a multilateral and diversified foreign policy 
to be friends will all nations on the principles of respecting 
one another's national independence, sovereignty, equality, 
cooperation, and mutual benefits is the duty of all people. 
This duty requires a widespread public movement to 
satisfactorily carry it out. 
  The noble and final goal of the party is to serve the 
people's interests. The leadership of the party is the 
concentration of the people's willpower, aspiration, and 
intelligence to outline the developing path and steps and to 
educate, organize, and change the mass organizations into great 
forces to practice the people's right to mastery and to carry 
out the aforementioned noble goal. 
  The law-governed state of the people, by the people, and for 
the people introduces laws to regulate the political, economic, 
social, national defense, security, and external affairs 
activities for the interests of the fatherland and the public. 
It creates favorable conditions for the people to practice and 
develop their rights to mastery, improve the material and 
spiritual life of their families, contribute to the common 
undertaking of the society, achieve happiness for themselves, 
and respect other people's freedom and happiness. 
  To mobilize human and natural resources to implement the 
party and state's policy, line, and law for the undertaking of 
national construction and protection, the people must be 
organized into different mass organizations. These 
organizations must really become political foundation and bases 
of the party, state, and public forces, working for a common 
interest. 
  For that reason, the Sixth Plenum of the party Central 
Committee issued a resolution on the mass motivation work with a 
fundamental idea as follows: In the new stage of the revolution, 
to make the revolution the people's undertaking, the party, 
state, and mass organizations must achieve high results in their 
mass motivation work. They must not look down on any social 
forces. Only from the continuous perfection of the division and 
coordination of the mass motivation content and work scale 
between the party, state, and mass organizations and with the 
development of a combined strength from all the forces, can we 
create great strength for the mass motivation work. The mass 
motivation work is a permanent, strategic, and fundamental duty 
of the party. From this fundamental conception, we must think 
profoundly and review our practical results to clarify and unify 
our conceptions to revamp the work content and method of the 
fatherland front and mass organizations in the new stage. 
  Thoroughly understanding this, together with the 
implementation of Uncle Ho's teachings and party's resolutions, 
the government and mass organizations have been improving the 
people's daily life and creating favorable conditions to 
generate more jobs, increase people's earnings, secure living 
conditions, foster patriotism, eliminate old structures, and 
actively contribute, build, perfect, and execute our renovation 
and socioeconomic policies. 
  Our socioeconomic situation, albeit great challenges, is 
gaining good developing momentum and scoring important 
socioeconomic achievements. In 1993, most of socioeconomic 
targets were overfulfilled. These achievements regain the 
confidence in the party and its renovation undertaking from the 
people, making them more active in the movements for the 
increase of business, production, and social activities. That 
is the result of the satisfactory implementation of party 
resolutions, including the important Resolution No. 8 of the 
sixth party plenum. 
  However, facing new requirements, we must continue to 
practically and profoundly review exemplary models to upgrade 
the mass motivation work to its new duties. 
  1. Strengthening the party leadership is an important factor 
to accelerate activities of the fatherland front, mass 
organizations, and public movements. The party performs its 
mass motivation work through guidelines and policies. Correct 
policies will create a great strength for public movements. For 
example, the correct policy of contractual system in agriculture 
has motivated peasants to increase agricultural production. The 
party must regularly listen to public opinions to quickly 
correct and amend its policies. 
  The party considers the guidance and motivation of the 
public 
for the construction of a law-governed state of the people, by 
the people, and for the people is the foremost duty of the mass 
motivation work in the new stage. It also creates favorable 
conditions to motivate the public to carry out the party's 
political duty and line. The party chapters and members working 
in the state organs must concretize the party's line and 
resolutions into government's decisions and policies. Through 
work experience and training, the party assigns good citizens 
with good morality, a sense of professionalism, and social 
management skills to government positions to maintain national 
order and counter waste and corruption. 
  The party directs the National Assembly elections 
adequately in order to choose highly qualified and competent 
deputies to represent the people's will and aspirations as well 
as the common interests of the nation as a whole. It directs 
the formulation and perfection of laws, regulations, policies, 
citizens' rights and duties, statutes, and practices at 
grassroots installations. It guides the establishment of 
administrative organs at all levels, keeping in mind the need to 
streamline their personnel organization to make them neat and 
effective and avoid overlapping work and delays, which cause 
obstacles and inconveniences for the people. 
  It is necessary to make use of party papers and other party 
propaganda instruments to propagate the party's policies and 
lines among the masses and motivate everyone to implement all 
party resolutions. It is important to step up educational 
activities to promote public awareness of false arguments and 
foil attempts by hostile forces to distort the truth and 
implement their peaceful evolution strategy. 
  The party directs the front and mass societies by helping 
them formulate their orientations, guidelines, objectives, and 
tasks. The party does not exert direct leadership over work 
implementation. Instead, it uses the activities of party groups 
and party members assigned to each organization to fulfill its 
leadership role and apply its resolutions to the practical 
action programs of the front and mass societies. Each 
organization should be given the chance to hold democratic 
discussions to decide on the content of its action program. 
  Through their separate guidelines and control work, party 
committee echelons discover and develop progressive elements in 
production and business organizations, as well as in special 
task force units and mass societies. It is necessary to assign 
party cadres and members to oversee or take part in the 
activities of mass societies so as to assess the actual 
situations of each organization, family, and individual, and 
thereby work out appropriate assistance programs. The action 
programs of party organizations must include the orientations 
and tasks of mass societies. Arrangements must be made for 
party committee echelons and party committee secretaries to meet 
periodically with the people to hear grievances and resolve 
problems. 
  Party members must not only take the lead in fulfilling the 
tasks of the units they are assigned to, but must also set a 
good example of high quality and ethics for members of other 
organizations to follow. Party members must go out of their way 
to serve the people and must always stand ready to direct and 
learn from the masses. Let them hold discussions with the people 
and help them make their legitimate aspirations come true. It 
is important to revamp party organizations; screen the 
contingent of party members; and get rid of opportunistic, 
corrupt, and deviant elements. It is necessary to put an end to 
unreasonable favors and privileges. Constant efforts must be 
made to build and develop the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union. 
Practical measures must be taken to accelerate party-building 
work among the youth, and to ensure that this task receives 
close guidance. 
  Party committee echelons in charge of providing guidance 
for mass motivation work have a fundamental duty to closely link 
party building -- especially the building of grass-roots party 
organizations -- with the building of the administration and 
mass organizations. Mass motivation work must be carried out in 
conjunction with and through the implementation of specific 
political tasks. 
  2. Our state is a law-governing state of the people, by the 
people, and for the people. Therefore, it has a very heavy duty 
toward the cause of mass motivation. President Ho Chi Minh 
said: "Administrative cadres, mass organization cadres, and 
members of the various mass organizations such as the Lien Viet 
[Vietnamese Alliance], the Viet Minh [Vietnamese Independence 
League], and others must all be responsible for mass motivation 
work." (Su That newspaper, 15 October 1949). President Ho put 
mass motivation work on top of other activities of the 
administration. This is because when there is a ruling party, 
public administration will become a main function of the state 
and will be carried out by means of laws and policies. In the 
same token, the state must carry out mass motivation mainly by 
means of laws and policies. These laws and policies must 
reflect party policies and lines and must be compatible with the 
people's aspirations and interests. They must become a 
tremendous driving force for the mass movement. 
  The state's working mechanism must create favorable 
conditions and environment legislatively, economically, 
politically, culturally, and socially, and in terms of national 
security and development so the people can feel secure in doing 
their business and can take the initiative in developing their 
production and business and organizing their own material and 
cultural life. 
  We must work out a correct system of laws, creating 
conditions for the people to carry out their production and 
business, broaden their branches and trades, and enrich 
themselves legally. Earlier, the government was anxious about 
finding enough food for the people to subsist on. Now it is 
concerned about the question of how to clear up the surplus 
foodgrain and how to produce high quality rice for export. The 
pace of house construction and of neighborhood and urban 
renovation among the people has been very fast, far beyond the 
imagination of many people. 
  The administration must work out substantive policies and 
systems for various areas of work in a correct and flexible way 
capable of keeping the people's activities under control. 
  The party and various mass organizations must also 
participate in the supervision of this issue. 
  The state must spread explanatory propaganda on the laws so 
the people can clearly understand and comply with them. 
Satisfactorily resolving various issues -- such as the issue of 
"doing away with hunger and easing poverty;" the issue of 
maintaining public order and security; the issue of education, 
public health, and culture; the issue of caring for those with 
meritorious deeds, for the families of disabled soldiers and 
fallen heroes, and for retired cadres; and the issue of caring 
for and providing assistance to people in dire straits -- by the 
administration at all levels is also part of our mass motivation 
work. 
  Attention must be paid to various organizations at the 
village, ward, and hamlet levels such as urban household groups 
which are the lowest organizations in close contact with the 
people. Such a self- governing popular organization, which 
controls not more than 15 families, is an appropriate and 
effective format which is designed to control each family and 
each group of families while caring for the life of people and 
resolving problems relating to the people in compliance with the 
resolutions and policies of the party Central Committee and the 
government. 
  The administration must use the mass media sysem to carry 
out 
its mass motivation work. The mass media is a highly sensitive 
and effective tool of the party and the state for carrying out 
mass motivation work. We must expand our radio and television 
transmission signals, especially radio transmission signals, to 
many localities in order to bring messages of the central 
authority to households. The party must direct mass 
organizations to join with the government in satisfactorily 
stepping up the activities of the mass media in the right 
direction. 
  Schools must be places where people are educated and trained 
to become educated persons with good ethical qualities. 
Teachers of both sexes must be active cadres in mass 
motivation, trying to build good people. We must bear in mind 
the need to improve the qualities of the education sector so it 
can become an effective tool for mass motivation. We must use 
the people's Armed Forces to carry out mass motivation work in 
various areas, particularly in remote and mountain areas.

<F P=106> [Part two of article by Vu Oanh, member of the Communist </F>
Party of Vietnam Political Bureau: "Developing Combined Forces 
in Mass Motivation Work and Renovating the Work Content and 
Method of the Fatherland Front and Mass Organizations"] 
  [Text] The government performs its public relations work 
through cadres and government officials' behavior and their 
working attitude. They must respect the people; listen to them; 
improve their work performance; and fight against corruption, 
authoritarianism, and bureaucracy. That will increase public 
trust to the government and the regime. Government officials 
must be trained in their work, management skills, and legal 
knowledge. The government must work with mass organizations to 
contain and eliminate sucessfully social vices, and safeguard 
social and political stabilization. 
  Life in mountainous areas is still very difficult and 
backward. Public relation work in ethnic-inhabited areas is 
still weak. We must pay proper attention to economic 
development and social issues in mountainous areas by opening 
schools in every mountain village, rebuilding schools under 
deterioration, eliminating the situation of teaching different 
grades in the same classroom, and reducing malaria, gout, 
leprosy, and tuberculosis... We must stop the imbalance between 
economic development and social advancement. 
  Government and mass organizations must coordinate their 
socioeconomic duties. The relation between the government and 
mass organizations is not a relation in which the government is 
always helping mass organizations. It must be understood that 
the government can only accomplish its duties, especially in 
movements to "eliminate starvation and reduce poverty" with the 
great support fo mass organizations. These movements must help 
poor families and families who rendered meritorious service to 
the country. These movements must also carry out other 
socioeconomic projects. 
  Government Decision No. 163 about the relation between the 
government and the Vietnam Women's Union is an example of 
coordination. The two sides must actively remind one another 
about the need for good cooperation and high efficiency in their 
work. 
  3. Renovating the working contents and methods for 
fatherland fronts and mass organizations to match their new 
duties is a necessary task. In the new situation with a new 
economic structure, the people will not accept fatherland fronts 
and mass organizations' ideas and programs of action if they do 
not meet their legitimate interests and aspirations. Realizing 
this, the sixth party Central Committee resolution on mass 
motivation work confirmed: "The work of mass organizations is 
to unite their members to look after their own practical 
interests, contribute to the national cause, and construct and 
protect the revolutionary government". President Ho Chi Minh 
said: "Mass organizations are organs of the masses, fight for 
the masses, protect the masses' interests, and closely connect 
with the masses and the government." (Ho Chi Minh Collected 
Works, Volume 5, page 393) The people's interests must be 
guaranteed and stipulated in the legal system. At the same 
time, their interests must also be guaranteed by a system of 
mass organizations, in which, the position, role, and function 
of each mass organization must be guaranteed by the law. The 
mass organizations must perform their best functions and duties 
to guarantee the people's benefits. 
  A. Fatherland fronts and mass organizations need to 
accelerate their political and ideological education to improve 
the people's knowledge. They have to instill national pride in 
the public. They also have to encourage them to overcome 
starvation and poverty, to enrich themselves legally for a 
better life, and to contribute more to society. They also need 
to upgrade the people's education levels, morality, aesthetics, 
professionalism, thoughts, and working skills. They should 
improve information services for politics, economy, culture, and 
society via newspapers, radio, television, and their other means. 
  We must upgrade the quality of the mass organization 
information service to ensure better dissemination of the party 
and state line and policy. The service must carry information 
suitable to particular communities and regions so the people can 
clearly understand the nature of the party's line and policy 
before they consciously observe them. 
  On the other hand, mass media agencies must tell the truth 
in 
any situation, avoid optimism, and direct public opinion on 
major political events. At the same time, they should carry 
articles suitable to different sexes amd ages, answer daily 
questions, and guide the public for to lead decent, useful, and 
helpful lives. 
  We must continue to construct and perfect a system which 
provides great effects to the public (social clubs, cultural 
houses, political and cultural centers, professional 
associations, and so forth). In order to attract more people, 
we must expand political activities and heighten national 
tradition and political awareness with social movements such as 
visits to former revolution bases for youths, receptions given 
to revolutionary prisoners sentenced to death, and public 
campaigns to support Cuba and victims of natural disasters. 
  Efforts must be made to develop various scientific research 
institutes and investigative agencies to effectively monitor and 
survey public opinion and the people's aspirations to correctly 
formulate measures for mass mobilization work and make proposals 
to the state for revising and supplementing various lines and 
policies. 
  We must improve activities to promote democracy and the 
ideological work at various mass organizations especially at the 
grass-roots level such as teams, chapters, work groups, 
families, and populated areas. We must strive to ensure that 
the people's thought and actions are in conformity with lines 
and policies of our party and those of the era. 
  B. Activities of the Vietnam Fatherland Front [VFF] and 
other 
mass organizations must be carried out in a wide and 
far-reaching fashion and must be in line with the socioeconommic 
development task. Following the arduous protracted war for 
national salvation and independence, our people's forefront 
tasks at present are to carry out socioeconomic development 
program and build a bountiful and happy life for the people as 
President Ho Chi Minh wishes: "Our nation will regain total 
independence, our people will enjoy full freedom, our countrymen 
will lead a bountiful life and are equally entitled to proper 
education." To live up to mankind's advancement, we will not 
stop at just a moderate happly life, but we should strive to 
attain a bountiful life with tastes and modern facilities. This 
is also the urgent demand and aspiration of our people. Whether 
or not the VFF and other mass organizations score achievement in 
their activities depends on how far they can meet the people's 
aspirations in this regard. 
  As for the industrial and goods circulation sectors, with 
the 
current market economic system, their production and business 
activities are facing serious challenges. They may experience 
failure, subjected to dissolvement, or can continue their 
operation with success, all depend on their efforts and 
determination. As a result, mass organizations should not cross 
their arms in vain and adopt a passive attitude when facing 
difficulties. They should, however, surge forward to 
participate in activities to develop their units and 
organizations. They should coordinate with responsible agencies 
to satisfactorily rearrange production, carry out projects, and 
apply contractual work for finished products at factories and 
workshops to enhance the workers' responsibility toward their 
work and the market; strive to diversify forms of ownership and 
introduce the share-holding enterprise system so as to prevent 
losses of state property, create more jobs for the workers, 
increase their income, and stabilize their daily life. 
  Various mass organizations and societies must mobilize their 
members to discuss and share weal and woe with specialized 
production establishments to find ways and means to overcome 
difficulties, protect and develop capital, produce new products, 
change equipment, strengthen industrial production network; 
improve packaging, delivery, and the production of new products. 
Efforts must be made to find new clients and expand markets 
while participating in implementing the policy on developing 
economic components. We must actively detect shortcomings in 
our legal system to make proposals to the state for revising the 
irrational laws while striving to protect the laborers' 
interest. We must respect the legitimate interest and social 
equality of owners of establishments, oppose all illegal 
business activities and tax evasion. In agriculture, various 
mass organizations must mobilize the peasants to implement 
resolution no. 10 on the contractual system, promote the 
allocation of land for long-term use and granting of ownership 
over some means of production to the peasants; encourage family 
economy and motivate peasants to engage in fruit orchard, fish 
rearing, gardening, aquaculture, and the production of 
specialized goods. Efforts must be made to develop the 
assistance program among the laborers to help one another in 
term of crop seeds, capital, and experience to integrate them 
into an economic cooperative organization to work for a mutual 
interest. Various social associations must carry out activities 
to guide the peasants to improve their production, transfer new 
technology to peasant families, develop all potentials to 
produce more products to amass wealth. For instance, the 
Women's Union in Tuyen Quang province has participated in a 
movement to promote agriculture and forestry, teach the peasants 
on how to raise hogs by using sugarcane juice, raise milk goats, 
and produce biogas (by using animal manure). Moreover, they also 
set up women's groups (481 in number) to practice thrift, 
provide loans to poor members to engage in some kind of trades 
or production to increase income and improve their daily life. 
  Various mass organizations must also strive to help and 
guide 
their members and the laborers to develop the family economy, 
produce agricultural products, develop production activities, 
and improve goods circulation. In cities, efforts must be made 
to improve work at resturants, dress-making factories, 
transportation, production of handicrafts, and export goods, 
thereby creating favorable conditions for the people to help 
resolve the unemployment problem and increase their incomes. 
  While we integrate our efforts in carrying out economic 
development program to revolve various problems, we should pay 
attention on resolving the social issues. Various mass 
organizations and societies must pay special attention to 
protecting the laborers' interest because it is a great and 
complicated issue. 
  Social issues and social policies are very copious. They 
involve jobs, food, clothing, housing, transport, education, 
rest and recreation, medical treatment, physical fitness, and 
the building of a new culture. Satisfactory resolution of this 
issue will have a vigorous effect on the feelings and emotions 
of the people and on their confidence in the party. 
  Together with responsible organs, mass organizations must be 
mindful of the need to resolve employment and must hold 
discussions to chart new course for production activities and 
new work methods. This is to help maintain production and set up 
additional workshops to create more employment. Mass 
organizations must motivate the people to participate in the 
movement against the degradation of educational and health 
facilities and to respond to a fund-raising drive designed to 
obtain money to ensure better pay for teachers, improve academic 
qualities, and repair and build schools and classrooms. We must 
ensure the enactment of good by-laws for schools and must pay 
attention to organizing vocational training in general education 
schools. We must encourage the people to build their physical 
fitness and preserve their health. We must build first-aid 
stations and medicinal herb gardens and satisfactorily care for 
the welfare of public health cadres and personnel. We must 
motivate the people to make contributions to the causes of 
providing medical treatment for handicapped children and 
disabled people and bringing up orphans. We must motivate the 
people to respond to the movement for family planning and must 
improve the composition and quality of our diet. 
  We must encourage and organize the people and create 
conditions for them to build houses in accordance with urban 
planning. We must promote the building of more brick houses in 
rural areas, build new urban areas, and ensure satisfactory 
repairwork for houses in various communities. 
  We must organize democratic debates among the people so they 
can help formulate and comply with regulations on the 
safeguarding of their neighborhoods and city wards. Mass 
organizations must cooperate with popular defense forces and 
professional security police in tracking down and getting rid of 
hoodlums, thieves, and other social ills. We must set up 
security funds and incentive funds to maintain and care for 
popular defense forces. We must motivate the people to detect 
evil elements and subject them to self criticism for 
correctional purposes. Youth union members and youth association 
members must help and encourage backward people to make progess. 
This can be done in various forms and ways, the most important 
of which being the setting of good examples for other people to 
follow. 
  We must encourage the people to participate in popular 
national defense work, ensure the fulfillment of troop 
recruitment targets, carry out the army's rearguard policy, 
using diversified methods to ensure that combatants and their 
families engage in national defense activities with peace of 
mind. 
  We must build a sense of attachment among members of a unit 
and between themselves and their parent unit and must promote 
mutual assistance among people in cases of illness and mishaps. 
We must encourage giving assistance to people in the event they 
suffer from misfortunes, catastrophes, and illness and for those 
hapless families with incapacitated members. We must set up 
mutual assistance funds, charity funds, and retirement funds in 
the rural areas. 
  Mass organizations must motivate the people to contribute 
their energy and money to helping the administration build 
public utility projects such as bridges, roads, power lines, 
schools, first-aid stations, communication networks, and 
cultural and information systems. 
  To make a long story short, we must initiate a widespread 
mass movement to carry out the following programs and movements: 
The program to do away with hunger and ease poverty, the program 
to resolve employment in conjunction with efforts to develop and 
restructure the economy, and provide vocational training for the 
people, especially for youths, the program for population and 
family planning, the program for preliminary heath care, the 
expanded program for immunization, the health insurance program, 
the program to develop folk culture, build a civilized lifestyle 
and cultural households, the program to fight outmoded customs 
and social ills, the program for illiteracy eradication, the 
program for compulsory education, the movement for physical 
fitness, the movement to repay the kindness of those who have 
performed their meritorious deeds for the nation, and the 
charity movement. 
  Mass organizations must cooperate in enaging in community 
reconciliation efforts in various residential areas. We must 
form reconciliation teams made up of prestigious and 
enthusiastic people. Meanwhile, we must make youth union members 
and youth association members responsible for the task of 
resolving differences among the people. We must motivate the 
people to live and work in accordance with the law. In the same 
token, the people must have the right to use the law as a means 
of self defense. We must fight against acts of coercion and 
injustice among government cadres and employees and against 
their misinterpretation of the law. 
  In carrying out the mass motivation task, mass organizations 
must closely cooperate with youth union members and youth 
association members in motivating outside people. We must 
involve ourselves more fully in seeking to know the specific 
situation of each family and each person and the feelings, 
emotions, and aspirations of the people. We must talk to the 
people, listen to their views, and discuss the situation with 
them. In this way, the people will be thoroughly aware of and 
voluntarily comply with the party and state policies and lines. 
We can also discuss those policy issues that are not properly 
carried out. Mass organizations may ask the state to amend or 
revise its policies in a rational and appropriate way. Mass 
organizations must work toward resolving policy-related demands 
of the people. They must blend themselves with the people to to 
find out each other's similar points of views. Activities of 
mass organizations must be compatible with the activities and 
interests of the people. Mass organizations must learn from the 
people and be in the service of the people. They must avoid 
imposing their will on the people or doing anything against the 
aspirations of the people. 
  Our policy system has, at certain times and in certain 
areas, 
not been compatible with realities. Given the limited 
capabilities of the state, mass organizations must explain this 
fact to the people so they can understand and live with it. We 
must consult with the people over our planned enforcement of 
policies to prevent them from feeling unhappy with our policies 
or the enforcement of these policies. Just as Nguyen Trai put 
it: "We must strive to do in such a way as to keep villages and 
hamlets free from angry voices," and "this will bring 
prosperity, peace, and happiness for all." Our people's 
intellectual standard has been further improved in keeping with 
the era of wisdoms, science and technologies. As there are many 
talented intellectual workers in our society who are the sons or 
brothers of the laboring people and who are renowned both at 
home and abroad, our existing mass motivation method is all the 
more important and will certainly develop its effect.

  [Text] People in "military society" are unhappy at 
newspapers which frequently present remarks of Army chief Gen 
Wimon Wongwanit in a way that could harm his image, according to 
an article in a recent army journal. The officer, Lt-Col 
Thatthiam Yiamnakhon, said that newspapers always described Gen 
Wimon, when he talked to reporters, as "talking too much". But 
whenever he did not talk, newspapers would say that he was 
angry. Lt-Col Thatthiam said military society, like others, had 
its own characteristics and way of life. 
  Military society adhered to traditions passed on to soldiers 
for generations and was hard to change. Soldiers always thought 
systematically, had a clear line of practice and did as they 
were told by their commanders. Soldiers were taught to speak 
and express opinions according to their responsibilities. They 
did whatever was decided by their bosses, who usually took full 
responsibility should anything go wrong, he said. Relations 
between commanders and their subordinates were so close that the 
soldiers were ready to follow their bosses anywhere without 
complaining. 
  "For the subordinates, their show of pain, dissatisfaction 
and sentiment on behalf of their bosses is normal," he said. 
  Lt-Col Thatthiam said it was normal for soldiers to feel 
unhappy at newspapers which used "improper" words to describe 
their top boss. 
  "Newspapers may think the army chief is a public figure who 
must be able to tolerate criticism, but soldiers who study only 
military matters throughout their life do not easily understand 
this," he said.

<F P=106> [Letter to the editor from Wirasak Futrakun, Thai ambassador </F>
to Burma] 
  [Text] I have read the editorial column entitled, "Burma 
[Myanmar] dams are clearly a crime against humanity," that 
appeared in THE NATION on Nov 15, 1993 with deep concern that 
your distinguished newspaper might not have been correctly 
informed about the hydroelectric projects along the Thai-Myanmar 
borders. As someone who knows something about these projects, I 
would like to clarify the status of these projects in order to 
allay some of your anxiety as follows: 
  1. It is true that seven projects have been identified for 
possible cooperation between Thailand and Myanmar since 
hydro-power is clean and renewable comparing to other sources of 
energy such as nuclear reactors or coals. It is not true that 
feasibility studies for seven of these projects have already 
been carried out. So far, only one feasibility study has been 
carried out. 
  2. At present, there exists no agreement between Thailand 
and Myanmar regarding the construction of the Salwin 
hydro-electric project. The decision to go ahead with the 
construction of this project must await a feasibility study 
which will take a few years and will include as part and parcel 
of the feasibility study an environmental impact assessment. 
Even now, there exists no agreement between the two countries 
on the implementation of a feasibility study of this project. 
  3. If and when there is a mutual agreement between Thailand 
and Myanmar regarding the Salwin hydroelectric project, the 
aforementioned environmental impact assessment will definitely 
take into consideration any impacts on the peoples living along 
that river, be they Karens, Shans, Paos, Was and many other 
ethnic groups. The dams, should they be built, may not even be 
located in the areas where some of the Karens are living along 
the Thai-Myanmar borders since there are several possible sites 
along this long river. 
  4. The present Government of the Union of Myanmar is just as 
environ mentally conscious as the Thai Government. The decision 
of the Government of the Union of Myanmar to terminate timber 
concessions along the Thai-Myanmar border is based on its 
concern to conserve the forests along the border which happen 
also to be watersheds for several of Thailand's own rivers. 
Although this decision has caused pain to many Thai logging 
companies, the Government of Myanmar also sacrifice revenues of 
more than two hundred million dollars per year in order to 
conserve these forests. We should respect their decision and 
should realize that a government that is willing to sacrifice 
such large revenues given its relatively small foreign exchange 
reserves for the sake of preserving its environment is unlikely 
to agree to any hydroelectric projects without undertaking prior 
environmental impact assessment and securing environmental 
safeguards. 
  5. As for the Karens living along the Thai-Myanmar borders, 
their fate is not limited to being, as THE NATION puts it, 
"forced into making a terrible choice between living in Slorc 
[State Law and Order Restoration Council] concentration camps or 
Thai refugee camps." First of all, there are more Karens living 
in other parts of Myanmar such as the Ayeyarwaddy Division than 
along the Thai-Myanmar border and they are living not in 
"concentration camps" but in towns and villages similar to other 
135 ethnic groups that comprise the people of Myanmar. Second, 
they can enter into negotiations with the Government of the 
Union of Myanmar as other ethnic groups such as the Kachins, the 
Was and the Kokangs have done so successfully in securing their 
autonomous areas and their ways of life. I sincerely hope that 
they will choose this option of negotiations instead of 
prolonging the war that has gone on nearly half a century, and 
has already brought about three or four lost generations of 
Karens, who could have been devoting themselves to develop the 
Karen State in the framework of the Union of Myanmar. 
  It is in Thailand's interest that there be national 
reconciliation with dignity among all the ethnic groups in 
Myanmar because a peaceful and prosperous Myanmar will be the 
best possible neighbour for Thailand.

  [Text] National Security Adviser Jose Almonte has proposed 
the creation of an economic growth area in the South China Sea 
as a confidence-building measure towards resolving territorial 
disputes over the oil-rich Spratly Islands. 
  Almonte's proposal came in the wake of Hanoi's move to 
reassert its claim over the disputed islands on the grounds that 
it was the first to discover them in the 17th century. 
  Speaking at a recent security conference among ASEAN think 
tanks, Almonte said "a multinational agreement to develop and 
exploit together the oil deposits in the Spratlys transcends the 
conflicting claims there." 
  The Spratlys is being contested by China, Taiwan, Vietnam 
and 
by the three members of Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN) -- Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines. 
  "My own government believes there is no substitute for 
consultations that produce a consensus among the claimant 
countries," he said, warning that a conflict in the area "could 
be injurious to the entire Asia-Pacific community." 
  Almonte's proposal was similar to the "economic growth 
triangles" being established by ASEAN-member countries in the 
various sub-regions, like the East ASEAN growth among East 
Indonesia, East Malaysia, Brunei and Mindanao in the Philippines. 
  Almonte, who is also a retired army general, believed that 
such economic arrangements can help bridge political differences 
among neighboring countries as well as "make their bilateral 
problems irrelevant." 
  As an example, he cited efforts by Manila and Kuala Lumpur 
to 
use the East ASEAN growth area to foster closer bilateral 
political and economic relations despite their differences over 
Sabah and overlapping fishing grounds in the South China Sea.

  [Text] The European Parliament has withdrawn its support 
to exiled Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) Chairman Jose 
Maria Sison, an official of the European Union told President 
Ramos yesterday. 
  The official, Ben Visser, first vice chairman of the 
parliamentary delegation visiting the country, said Sison, who 
is based in Utrecht, the Netherlands, "no longer enjoys 
substantial support in Western Europe." 
  "Sison and his followers are now considered an isolated 
group 
where before he had received sympathy and support from some 
quarters," he said. 
  Visser, who belongs to the Party of European Socialists in 
the Netherlands, explained that the change in attitude towards 
Sison was on account of his continued adherence to the Maoist 
ideology which now belongs to the past and has almost no future. 
  On the other hand, Gunther Rinshe, chairman of the 
delegation, said that President Ramos' approach to the peace 
process "is really impressive." 
  "It makes such a good impression that you are almost 
considered as a model for all of us in our part of the world," 
Rinshe, a member of the European People's Party of Germany, said. 
  The president said that the Philippines is now enjoying a 
period of relative peace which is people-based. 
  The peace process, the chief executive explained, was 
arrived 
at through a very thorough consultative process at the local 
level. 
  The president, however, admitted having difficulties 
negotiating with the Communist Party of the Philippines and the 
National Democratic Front (NDF) which, he said, "may be 
fragmented right now." 
  "But just the same, in spite of these difficulties, we have 
offered the hand of peace to them so that we can finally come to 
a just, honorable and lasting peace," the president said. 
  Meanwhile, President Ramos urged the members of the 
delegation to consider possible cooperation in the field of 
technology transfer and environmental protection between the 
Philippines and European countries. 
  During their meeting, the president outlines several 
policies 
his administration is undertaking on the social and economic 
upliftment of the Filipino people. 
  The president said the Philippines is also giving priority 
to 
power and energy development and upgrading of the 
telecommunications and transportation systems. 
  He also cited the growing network of cooperation among the 
countries in the Asia-Pacific which he said has developed to be 
a cohesive union of countries. 
  "We are seeing enhanced stability because of economic 
progress. The countries in our region are really becoming more 
and more stable," he said.

  [Text] Armed Forces chief General Lisandro Abadia 
yesterday called on Nur Misuari, chief of the Moro National 
Liberation Front (MNLF) to get members of the dreaded Abu Sayyaf 
group out of Basilan and Jolo to prove their sincerity in 
attaining peace in Mindanao. 
  Abadia aired the call to Misuari in yesterday's breakfast 
forum at the Manila Pavilion. 
  "Nakikiusap kami sa MNLF na kung hindi ninyo makumbinsi, 
paalisin ninyo sila (Abu Sayyaf members). Nakakahiya, naguusap 
tayo tapos yung mga kriminal nasa paligid natin [We are 
appealing to the MNLF that if you can't convince them (Abu 
Sayyaf members), then get rid of them. It's a shame to talk 
peace while criminals are freely roaming around us]," Abadia 
said. 
  Although Abadia has belittled the capacity of Abu Sayyaf 
members -- about 100 to 150 plain criminals -- to launch major 
offensives against the government, he nevertheless sought the 
help of MNLF in maintaining peace and order in the area. 
  Police reports said that while peace negotiations between 
the 
government and the MNLF were going on, suspected members of 
Muslim extremist group Abu Sayyaf were reportedly sighted 
roaming around Jolo, Sulu and Basilan. 
  However, Abadia refused to comment on reports that the Abu 
Sayyaf is the "money-making front" of the MNLF but said that the 
extremist group has generated enough money from kidnaping and 
other criminal activities. 
  Abadia also said that the recent clashes between government 
troops and some members of the MNLF did not in any way affect 
the ongoing peace talks. 
  "Soldiers have to defend the innocent people," Abadia said. 
  The 7 November interim cease fire agreement states that "the 
forces of both parties shall remain in their respective places 
and refrain from any provocative actions or any acts of 
hostilities." 
  Latest reports reaching Camp Aguinaldo said at least seven 
troopers were wounded following a clash with MNLF rebels in 
Basilan last Saturday [22 Jan], the most serious breach of the 
interim cease fire agreed on by the government and the rebel 
group. 
  Earlier reports of clashes after the truce pact was inked 
were all attributed either to the communist New People's Army 
(NPA) or the so-called "MNLF Lost Commands." 
  In the past few weeks, sporadic encounters between 
government 
troops and suspected MNLF members in Basilan had resulted in the 
wounding of dozens of soldiers and policemen and an undetermined 
number of casualties to the rebels. 
  Mindanao Marines commander Brigadier General Guillermo Ruiz 
and co-chairman of the joint cease fire committee has said that 
"minor violations" on both sides had been reported and that 
these would be addressed by the committee.

  [Text] Baguio City -- The Cordillera Regional Assembly 
[CRA], the supposed legislative arm of the Cordillera Autonomous 
Region, has joined the fray against the holding of a special 
plebiscite on 28 February in five towns in Kalinga Apayao to 
ratify the 1990 Organic Act for the Cordillera Autonomous Region. 
  CRA Chairman Sergio Kawi, in a petition he submitted last 18 
January to the Commission on Elections [Comelec], disputed 
claims that there was a "failure of elections" in the five 
Kalinga Apayao towns during the January 1991 plebiscite. 
  "There was no continuous uneasy peace and order 
necessitating 
the failure to elect/vote as shown by the fact that the 1992 
local and national elections were peacefully held in the area," 
Kawi said in his petition. 
  But it was the "uneasy peace and order" that initiated the 
electoral protest. 
  Then Kalinga Apayao Rep. William Claver said that there was 
a 
"failure of elections" because 7,309 voters were disenfranchised 
in 28 village precincts in Pinukpuk, Balbalan, and Conner towns. 
  Former rebel priest Conrado Balweg, head of the Cordillera 
People's Liberation Army, blamed the members of the New People's 
Army who, he said, snatched the ballot boxes in these areas and 
41 other villages in Tanudan and Tinglayan towns. 
  "There was an election but the votes were not counted," he 
said. 
  Kawi said that under the Omnibus Election Code, another 
election should proceed 30 days after the electoral protest was 
upheld. 
  "Matagal nang nag-lapse ang 30 days [thirty days went by a 
long time ago], why would they hold the plebiscite only now?" he 
asked. 
  A special plebiscite was actually set on 19 January 1991 -- 
30 days after the Comelec called for a special plebiscite in 
Kalinga Apayao -- but the military conducted an operation 
[oplam] named Oplan Redlips in Conner and even declared three 
villages as a "no man's land." 
  Only Ifugao voted for the autonomous region. Kalinga Apayao 
had 27,898 "No" votes as against 17,919 "Yes" votes, leaving a 
margin of 9,979.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 28 KYODO -- A senior trade ministry 
official on Friday [28 January] called for a more cooperative 
approach by the private sector to help increase American access 
to Japan's automobile and auto parts markets. 
  "The cooperation approach" being proposed by the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI] for Japan's auto 
industry is designed to dispel "mutual distrust" between 
Washington and Tokyo in the bilateral trade framework talks, 
Sozaburo Okamatsu, deputy vice MITI minister, told a press 
conference. 
  Okamatsu was briefing reporters on his recent visit to the 
United States, which was intended to help lay the groundwork for 
the February 11 summit between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  Through a series of talks with top executives of the U.S. 
"Big three" carmakers and U.S. Government officials over a week 
until Wednesday, it was made clear that the two sides remain 
apart over the definition of the term "objective criteria" 
agreed between them previously, Okamatsu said. But he added the 
two parties agreed not to resort to "cosmetic" accords just to 
tide over the February meeting. 
  Okamatsu said the new cooperation scheme comprises three 
phases -- the setting of objective criteria by each auto maker 
in parts purchases and other areas, evaluation of performance in 
accordance with the criteria on a semiannual basis and deciding 
whether or not to craft additional steps based on the assessment. 
  Criteria for Japanese carmakers may also include the number 
of their dealership chains handling U.S.-made cars and whether 
the "design-in" approach is being adopted by them, Okamatsu said. 
  On the other hand, criteria would also be applied to U.S. 
automakers, such as whether their products are tailored to meet 
the needs of Japanese motorists by, for instance, having 
right-hand steering wheels, he said. 
  The new approach regards the establishment of mutually 
cooperative relationships on a private-sector level as a first 
step toward progress in bilateral trade talks, Okamatsu said. 
  Turning to the issue of a government role in trade and other 
business activities, he said the Japanese side rejected a U.S. 
call for Tokyo to use administrative guidance to increase 
imports. 
  Such a step would run counter to Prime Minister Hosokawa's 
major policy of deregulation, Okamatsu said. 
  After the press conference, a senior MITI official 
accompanying Okamatsu on his U.S. visit said he had the 
impression that views among U.S. Government officials are a bit 
divergent over the definition of objective criteria. But the 
Clinton administration, with the free market mechanism held up 
as its chief economic policy, will probably work hard in order 
to coordinate the differing views, said the official who 
declined to be named.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from "NHK News 7" program] </F>
  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] has begun an investigation into whether a Japanese 
trading firm violated a law prohibiting arms deals. The firm 
was involved in a deal whereby a decommissioned Russian 
submarine was exported to North Korea. 
  Since the deal was revealed early this month, the ministry 
has suggested that the firm might have acted as a mediator to 
provide arms to North Korea. The submarine was sold by Russia 
to North Korea. 
  NHK took this footage last May when a salvage operation was 
underway. [video shows Russian submarines -- including a 
worn-out "Golf II" class submarine -- being salvaged] Ruskiy 
Island in Vladivostok Bay is the graveyard for decommissioned 
ships from the Russian Fleet. The submarine in question was 
towed from the island to Najin, a port in the north of North 
Korea. 
  THE NEW YORK TIMES of the United States reported 40 
submarines have been sold by Russia to North Korea through 
Japanese trading companies. The report has caused considerable 
concern since the international community increasingly suspects 
that North Korea is attempting to develop nuclear weapons. 
  How was this recent deal concluded? It was a salvage company 
in Vladivostok which refloated the submarine and towed it to 
North Korea. (Boyko), managing director of the submarine 
salvage company, said they towed only one submarine to North 
Korea. Asked if this was disassembled, he said they salvaged it 
as it was. He added he heard the North Koreans would scrap the 
submarine. 
  Admiral (Gromov), commander-in-chief of the Russian Navy, 
has 
confirmed the deal. He said the Russian Defense Ministry 
entered into a direct business contract with a Japanese company. 
The trading company in Tokyo which arranged the submarine deal 
was set up three years ago. The company has four employees, and 
has a factory which is a joint venture with North Korea. About 
one year ago the company began buying up Russian locomotives and 
rails to sell as scrap iron. 
  The company said the submarine deal this time was proposed 
by 
its North Korean partner last September, and it was asked to 
guarantee payment to Russia. The company said it had been asked 
by a Russian firm if it would buy submarines for scrap iron. 
This being the situation, the company said it believed the 
submarine deal had nothing to do with armaments. 
  The president of the trading company said the submarines and 
warships are purchased for use as scrap iron. He said he does 
not understand why this has become such a big issue. If North 
Korea had intended to use it for military purposes, it could 
have made a direct request to Russia to sell a submarine. He 
said Russia would be willing to do this for the right price. 
  NHK has learned more about this scrap iron business which 
involves four countries in the Far East -- over decommissioned 
submarines from the days of the arms race in the Cold War. Old 
submarines are purchased for $60 per ton (by the Japanese 
company). The submarines are dismantled and turned into scrap 
iron in North Korea. The scrap iron is then sold back to the 
Japanese trading company for $130 per ton, including labor costs 
and other expenses. The company then sells the scrap to China 
for around $170 a ton -- the international market price. The 
company makes a profit of $40 a ton, and North Korea obtains 
about $70 per ton in hard currency. 
  The people involved said this was a straight-forward deal in 
scrap iron. Was it true of the submarine which was delivered to 
North Korea? The submarine in question was commissioned by the 
Russian Pacific Fleet in the 1960's, and was decommissioned six 
years ago. Russia says the old weapons and equipment were 
removed. 
  Military commentator Kensuke Obata said the submarine has 
been underwater for more than five years, and, as such, should 
be almost impossible to put it back into use as a submarine. He 
said because it is made up of top quality iron, it could be a 
source of earning hard currency from third countries -- if the 
submarine is dismantled by cheap labor. Obata said this is the 
only way for the submarine to be of any value in his opinion. 
  The collapse of the Soviet Union has forced North Korea to 
depend for its crude oil supply on China. Iron has become the 
only metal that can be exported to China in return. Labor is 
cheap in North Korea, and there is a large number of obsolete 
submarines in Russia. The economic boom in China has sharply 
increased the demand for iron there. The deal was made possible 
by the domestic situation in each of these three countries. 
  Meanwhile, MITI's Export Division said it is now looking 
into 
the matter because it is possible the deal violated the Foreign 
Exchange Law and the Foreign Trade Control Law which prohibit 
mediation in arms deals.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 28 KYODO -- Japan is preparing to send 
a team to monitor the March 20 presidential and parliamentary 
elections in El Salvador, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura said Friday [28 Janaury]. Takemura said the cabinet 
will make a final decision on the dispatch after receiving 
formal request from the United Nations. 
  A peace accord was signed in January last year after a 
decade-long "proxy war" in El Salvador between the government, 
backed by the United States, and rebel troops, backed by the 
former Soviet Union. 
  A Foreign Ministry source said the government is planning to 
send a team of between 10 and 15 people and is trying to enlist 
Spanish-speaking members, some of them from universities. 
  A statement released by the secretariat of the international 
peace cooperation headquarters within the prime minister's 
office said the secretariat is preparing for the dispatch before 
receiving a formal request because of the estimated time needed 
to put equipment and personnel together to meet the departure 
deadline. 
  Elsewhere, Economic Planning Agency Director General Manae 
Kubota told reporters "it's all right sending personnel to El 
Salvador, but we should think very carefully about sending (any) 
to the former Yugoslavia." 
  El Salvador's President Alfredo Felix Christiani, in a 
meeting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Tokyo on 
November 4, asked Japan to send election monitors for the March 
poll. Japan previously sent election monitors to Angola, 
Cambodia and Mozambique, officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 28 KYODO -- Japan has decided to extend 
full economic and technical cooperation assistance to the former 
Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, government sources said Friday 
[28 January]. 
  The sources said that next week Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata 
will announce the government's intention on bilateral assistance 
to Macedonia, along with additional medical and food assistance 
through United Nations organizations. 
  They said the government will dispatch a five-to-six member 
survey mission to Macedonia in the spring to study what kind of 
technical assistance Japan should render. 
  Japan will send experts on business management and 
revitalization of small and medium-sized enterprises to 
Macedonia and receive two or three Macedonian Government 
officials in Tokyo, they said. 
  The sources said the government will also continue studying 
whether to contribute personnel to the former Yugoslavia under 
the country's law on cooperation with UN peacekeeping operations. 
  Shunji Yanai, a senior Foreign Ministry official and head of 
a Japanese survey team that recently visited the region to look 
into the matter, told a press conference last week that 
Macedonia asked for economic assistance and cooperation to solve 
its debt problem. 
  Macedonia, which is the poorest and the most economically 
troubled of the former Yugoslav states, is presently untouched 
by the conflict that has spread through the region.

  [Text] Tokyo, jan. 28 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii said Friday [28 January] he has received "unofficial" 
notice on a German-proposed meeting in February of finance 
ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven (G-7) 
industrialized nations. A concrete schedule, including the date 
and place, is "now under arrangement," and "I would like to 
attend if my schedule allows," Fujii told reporters after a 
morning cabinet meeting. 
  Germany has reportedly proposed the G-7 meeting on February 
26 in Frankfurt to discuss world economy and aid to Russia. 
  Meanwhile, Fujii reiterated the timetable is yet not set for 
the adoption of a new economic stimulus package and the budget 
compilation, saying, "I don't have any fresh factors to comment 
on." But he also repeated the government wants to set the 
package and the third fiscal 1993 budget before Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa meets U.S. President Bill Clinton in 
Washington on February 11. 
  "As I have been saying, we must create an environment" in 
which Hosokawa can explain Japan's economic policies "in view of 
international society," Fujii said. 
  Asked about the economic impact from delayed stimulus 
measures, Fujii said the government will "certainly" take the 
measures as promised to the public and will also "certainly" 
form the third extra budget to finance the measures. He noted 
that a delay in the writing of the fiscal 1994 budget will 
undermine the economy "psychologically," but "in terms of real 
demand, the third budget is "more effective." 
  Concerning U.S. hopes of Japan including an income tax cut 
as 
the key measure, he said, "I can't fully comment on that yet. 
  Fujii said he would "carefully watch" the currency market, 
referring to the yen's appreciation to the 108 level against the 
dollar on speculation over U.S. pressure on Japan ahead of the 
summit. "But there are no rapid movements yet" in the 
dollar-yen rate, he said. 
  Fujii brushed aside reports that a policy-making committee 
of 
the coalition parties is inclined to separate a consumption tax 
hike from the tax cut, and he stressed that a decision on the 
tax issue will be left to a joint economic forum of the 
government and coalition parties. 
  The Finance Ministry is insisting that the tax cut and hike 
be included in a single program to ensure a financial source for 
cutting income taxes before hiking the consumption tax.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 28 KYODO -- Former Foreign Minister 
Michio Watanabe urged the governing coalition Friday [28 
January] to accept the failure of its political reform package 
to win Diet approval. The comment came as speculation continued 
over whether Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa would attempt to 
reach an eleventh hour compromise with the opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party to get the measures passed before the Diet 
session ends Saturday. 
  Watanabe, speaking at the Japan National Press Club, called 
on coalition and opposition parties to instead issue statements 
committing themselves to legislate provisions to crack down on 
electoral fraud and bribe-taking by March, and to continue 
discussions on changes to the electoral system. He also 
expressed support for a proposal to pass a law giving 
prosecutors' power to arrest Diet members who take bribes. 
  He said he backed a draft bill jointly proposed by Social 
Democratic Party veteran Hideko Ito and Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP) legislator Katsuhiko Shirakawa. "If the proposed draft 
bill were legislated, it alone would be able to exert a powerful 
effect to dissuade a Diet member from taking a bribe," said 
Watanabe, leader of the LDP's second-largest faction. 
  Under the bill, a Diet member could be liable to up to three 
years in prison if they accepted a bribe to use their political 
influence to persuade other politicians or bureaucrats to favor 
a specific business interest. 
  The draft bill, now being promoted by more than 50 
legislators from both the LDP and the Social Democratic Party, 
was submitted to both houses of the Diet on Tuesday.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 28 KYODO -- The opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) has given its leader Yohei Kono full 
authority to decide on holding talks with the ruling coalition 
on political reform, LDP officials said Friday [28 January]. 
Kono will be free to decide whether to have a make-or-break 
top-level meeting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on the 
issue, they said. 
  The LDP, the main opposition party, reached the decision at 
a 
meeting of its Executive Council, the officials said. 
  Kono signaled willingness to have a faceoff with Hosokawa to 
help break the deadlock brought about by the House of 
Councillors' rejection on January 21 of the government's 
political reform package. 
  The more powerful House of Representatives passed the four 
bills on November 18. 
  "In the face of the difficult situation, I will do my best 
as 
the party president to make the party's final decision," before 
the end of the current Diet session on Saturday, Kono said at 
the meeting. 
  The ruling coalition and the opposition camp, including the 
LDP, failed to reach a compromise on political reform Thursday 
midnight at a meeting of a joint council of the two houses. 
  Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito [New 
Government 
Party] and the coalition's chief negotiator, who chaired the 
meeting, declared an end to the effort by the joint council to 
find ground for a compromise. 
  The joint panel was made up of 10 members from the coalition 
who voted for the bills in the lower house and 10 legislators 
from the opposition who opposed the bills in the upper house. 
Both sides rejected the other's proposals. 
  Lower house speaker Takako Doi urged Ichikawa to continue 
trying to reach a compromise in the joint council. 
  Meanwhile, Hosokawa expressed his willingness to hold talks 
with Kono in an attempt to break the impasse. In a meeting 
Friday morning with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, Hosokawa reaffirmed his 
resolve to meet Kono, coalition sources said. 
  The coalition and the LDP, however, remain far apart over 
both electoral reform for the lower house and reform of 
political fund-raising, and even if Hosokawa and Kono meet, the 
prospects of reaching an accord are slim, political analysts 
said. 
  If the talks end in failure, some coalition members hinted, 
the coalition will send the package back to a plenary session of 
the lower house to seek a two-thirds majority to pass the bills. 
  This would require some 70 rebels from the LDP to vote for 
the package. 
  If the bills fail to be passed, Hosokawa will be forced to 
have his cabinet resign en masse or dissolve the lower house for 
a snap election, the analysts predicted. 
  Hosokawa said Thursday he will not cling to power if he 
fails 
to achieve political reform by Saturday's closure of the 
parliamentary session. 
  The reform package is intended to introduce a new electoral 
system for the lower house involving a mix of single-seat 
constituencies and proportional representation to replace the 
existing multiple-seat districts, as well as tightening curbs on 
political funding.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 28 KYODO -- The governing coalition 
decided early Friday [28 January] morning to urge Yohei Kono, 
president of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), 
to hold a meeting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to break 
the deadlock over crucial political reform bills, coalition 
source said. 
  The coalition made the decision at a meeting of leaders of 
the seven coalition partners after Yuichi Ichikawa, a chief 
negotiator for the coalition, just before midnight declared an 
end to a series of talks in a joint Diet committee. The 
committee, comprised of members of both houses of the Diet, was 
discussing salvaging the government reform package. 
  However, LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori told reporters 
the joint Diet panel still continues to exist and that his party 
will not agree to hold a summit meeting while panel talks 
continue. 
  Lower house speaker Takako Doi urged Ichikawa to continue 
efforts to reach a compromise in the joint Diet panel. 
  The coalition and the LDP are far apart over the electoral 
and political reform bills and if a top meeting between Hosokawa 
and Kono is held, the prospect of reaching an accord is dim, 
political analysts said. If Hosokawa and Kono fail to reach a 
compromise, the coalition will put the package to a floor vote a 
second time at a plenary session of the House of Representatives 
to seek a two-thirds majority vote to enact the bills. 
  The package cleared the lower house last November but was 
voted down by the House of Councillors last Friday. 
  Although the LDP is divided over electoral reform bills, the 
coalition will fail to secure a two-thirds majority vote in the 
lower house, political analysts said. The coalition will need 
some 70 rebels from the LDP to secure a two-thirds majority. 
  If the package is killed, Hosokawa will be forced to make 
his 
cabinet resign en masse or dissolve the lower house for a snap 
general election, they said. 
  Hosokawa said Thursday he will not to cling to power if he 
fails to achieve political reform by Saturday's closure of the 
current Diet session.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 28 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and Yohei Kono, head of the opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP), met Friday [28 January] evening in a 
last-minute bid to reach agreement on political reform bills. 
  The meeting began at around 7 P.M. shortly after Hosokawa 
and 
Kono met separately with Takako Doi, speaker of the House of 
Representatives, who urged the two rivals to come to terms on 
the issue. 
  Ichiro Ozawa, co-leader of Shinseito [Japan Reneweal Party], 
the second-largest but most influential party in the ruling 
coalition, attended the top-level meeting along with LDP 
Secretary General Yoshiro Mori. 
  Mori told reporters just before the start of the meeting 
that 
the LDP leadership agreed to meet with Hosokawa and Ozawa in 
response to a compromise proposal made by Doi, a former 
chairwoman of the Social Democratic Party (SDP). 
  Doi proposed passing the bills without setting a date for 
implementation and then discussing revision of the package in 
the next ordinary Diet session, coalition sources said. 
  Earlier, Hosokawa met with Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of 
the 
SDP, the largest party in the coalition, to seek his support for 
a face-off with Kono, officials said. The SDP has been 
opposed to making further concessions on the political reform 
bills. 
  The coalition and the opposition, including the LDP, failed 
to reach an accord over the issue Thursday night at a meeting of 
the joint council of the two Diet houses. 
  The council was made up of 10 members from the coalition who 
voted for the bills in the lower house and 10 legislators from 
the opposition who opposed the package in the upper house. 
  The alliance moved closer to the LDP position by amending 
the government's four-bill reform package, which was voted down 
by the House of Councillors last Friday. The package passed the 
more powerful House of Representatives last November. 
  The coalition's compromise proposal would increase the 
number 
of single-seat constituencies to 280 from 274 in the original 
bill and cut the number of proportional representation seats 
correspondingly to 220 from 226. The mix is intended to replace 
the current multiple-seat constituency system in lower house 
elections. 
  The coalition is also backpedaling on the initial blanket 
ban 
on corporate donations to individual politicians by allowing 
members of local assemblies to receive such donations for five 
years after the reform bills are enacted. 
  In the joint council session, the LDP rejected the 
compromise, and counterproposed its own slightly revised reform 
package, which was rejected by the lower house in November. 
  The LDP version calls for 300 seats single-seat 
constituencies and 171 under proportional representation, as 
well as allowing individual politicians to accept corporate 
donations through designated fund-raising organizations. 
  The coalition refused to accept this, and Yuichi Ichikawa, 
secretary general of Komeito and the coalition's chief 
negotiator, who chaired the meeting, declared an end to the 
effort by the joint council to find ground for a compromise. 
  If the talks between Hosokawa and Kono end in failure, the 
coalition will send the package back to a plenary session of the 
lower house to seek a two-thirds majority to pass the bills, 
some coalition members hinted. 
  This would require some 70 rebels from the LDP to vote for 
the package. 
  If the bills fail to be passed, Hosokawa will be forced to 
have his cabinet resign en masse or dissolve the lower house for 
a snap election, political analysts say. 
  Hosokawa said Thursday he will not cling to power if he 
fails 
to achieve political reform by Saturday's close of the Diet 
session.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 28 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and Yohei Kono, head of the opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP), reached agreement on political reform 
legislation on Friday [28 January] evening, well-placed sources 
said, averting a showdown which threatened Hosokawa's young 
government and seemed likely to further delay Tokyo's efforts to 
revive the sluggish economy. 
  The sources said the two rivals arrived at a compromise 
accord which calls for electing the House of Representatives 
through a mix of 300 single-seat districts and 200 seats 
distributed by proportional representation based on the division 
of the country into 11 blocs. 
  It was not immediately clear exactly when and how the new 
agreement would be sent to the Diet for a vote. The current 
parliamentary session ends on Saturday. 
  Flanked by Ichiro Ozawa, co-leader of Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party], the second-largest but most influential party in 
the ruling coalition, and LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori, 
the two leaders also agreed to allow each lawmaker to maintain 
one fundraising organization, the sources said. 
  The agreement came about after nearly two hours of talks 
between Hosokawa and Kono in the Diet building. 
  The meeting began at around 7 P.M., shortly after Hosokawa 
and Kono met separately with Takako Doi, speaker of the House of 
Representatives, who urged the two leaders to come to terms on 
the issue. Doi proposed passing the bills without setting a 
date for implementation and then discussing revision of the 
package in the next ordinary Diet session opening Monday, 
coalition sources said. 
  But both Hosokawa and Kono rejected Doi's compromise 
proposal 
and later produced the agreement by themselves, coalition and 
LDP sources said. 
  The coalition and the opposition, including the LDP, failed 
to reach an accord over the issue Thursday night at a meeting of 
a joint council of the two Diet houses. 
  The council was made up of 10 members from the coalition who 
voted for the bills in the lower house and 10 legislators from 
the opposition who opposed the package in the upper house. 
  In the joint council session, the LDP rejected the 
compromise, and countered with its own slightly revised reform 
package, which was rejected by the lower house in November. 
  The coalition's original version had called for 274 
single-seat districts and 226 seats alloted by proportional 
representation, compared with the LDP version's of 300 
single-seat constituencies and 171 seats allotted by 
proportional representation. 
  The LDP proposal had also called for allowing individual 
politicians to accept corporate donations through designated 
fundraising organizations. 
  The coalition refused to accept this, and Yuichi Ichikawa, 
secretary general of Komeito and the coalition's chief 
negotiator, who chaired the meeting, declared an end to the 
effort by the joint council to find ground for a compromise. 
  Hosokawa said Thursday he will not cling to power if he 
fails 
to achieve political reform by Saturday's close of the Diet 
session.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 28 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and Yohei Kono, head of the opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP), reached a basic compromise on political 
reform bills Friday [28 January] in eleventh-hour talks to break 
the stalemate, political sources said. 
  The compromise plan calls for replacing the current 
multi-seat constituencies for the House of Representatives with 
a combination of 300 single-seat constituencies and 200 
proportional representation seats to be allotted based on the 
popular vote in 11 electoral units, the sources said. 
  On the equally controversial issue of political 
fund-raising, 
the two sides agreed to allow individual politicians to 
designate one body for gathering political donations from 
enterprises and groups, they said. 
  Despite prospects that the compromise might undermine the 
original purpose of stopping rampant political corruption, the 
bills are likely to be enacted before the end of current Diet 
session on Saturday, the sources said. 
  Hosokawa's coalition government moved to bridge the gap 
between itself and the LDP by agreeing to amend the government's 
four-bill reform package, which was voted down by the House of 
Councilors last Friday. The package passed the more powerful 
lower house last November. 
  After the joint council of both houses of the Diet 
established for the purpose approves the compromise, the 
government-proposed bills may be passed Saturday, the final day 
of the current Diet session, and then revised in the next 
session starting Monday. The council is made up of 10 members 
from the coalition who voted for the bills in the lower house 
and 10 legislators from the opposition who opposed the package 
in the upper house. 
  Hosokawa and Kono talked at the Diet building for about two 
hours Friday evening after Takako Doi, speaker of the lower 
house, urged the two rivals to come to terms on the issue. 
  Ichiro Ozawa, co-leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], 
the second-largest but most influential party in the ruling 
coalition, also attended the meeting along with LDP Secretary 
General Yoshiro Mori. 
  Doi proposed passing the bills without setting a date for 
implementation and then discussing revision of the package in 
the next Diet session, the sources said. 
  The compromise plan ultimately agreed to was revealed to 
reporters during a break in the meeting when both Hosokawa and 
Kono visited Doi to report about the plan. During the break, 
Mori told reporters that the two sides had agreed not to accept 
Doi's own proposals for dealing with the problem.

Chairman Tomiichi Murayama in Tokyo -- live] 
  [Text] I shall make this announcement in the form of a 
chairman's statement: 
  With the agreement reached today between the ruling and 
opposition parties regarding the political reform bills -- 
excuse me, has this been passed out to everybody? Okay? -- 
prospects for the bills to be passed during the current Diet 
session have become certain. Regarding political reform, debate 
has been conducted for over five years, and two administrations 
in the past have failed to bring it about. Moreover, the issue 
has been associated with the images of various political parties 
and has had a deep impact on the very existence of Diet members 
and politicians. Thus, debates on this issue have taken a very 
difficult course. 
  Since Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Liberal 
Democratic 
Party President Yohei Kono have reached an agreement on a 
proposal presented by House of Representatives Speaker Takako 
Doi, our party will support this. I have indicated to Prime 
Minister Hosokawa that the agreement originally reached among 
the coalition parties regarding the political reform bills is 
the party's bottom line. However, we have judged that the party 
should not cause all the efforts made toward bringing about 
political reform to end up in smoke, nor shake the very 
foundations of the coalition government. Therefore, we have 
decided to accept this new agreement. We consider this a step 
forward from the existing conditions. In a continued endeavor 
toward promoting political reform in the future, we shall pour 
our utmost efforts into making up for what is lacking in the 
agreement. We ask for the understanding of the entire party, 
the people, and all our supporters. That is all.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 28 KYODO -- Business leaders on Friday 
night welcomed the eleventh-hour agreement reached between Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and the head of the opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party on troubled political reform bills. 
  "I welcome it from my heart," said Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman 
of the powerful Federation of Economic Organizations 
(Keidanren). "Now I hope that both the ruling and opposition 
parties will pass the bills in the Diet as early as possible and 
tackle urgent tasks such as economic measures and the Japan-U.S. 
Summit," Hiraiwa said. 
  Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry, said the agreement capped a six-year-old controversy 
and broke the deadlock in politics. "I hope it will somewhat 
clear the air hanging over the people and have a positive effect 
on the economy," Inaba said. 
  The business community has been pressing for an early 
passage 
of political reform bills, with Masaru Hayami, chairman of the 
Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai), 
calling it a prerequisite for writing recession-fighting 
economic measures. 
  Wrangling over the proposed political reform bills has kept 
Hosokawa's coalition government from hammering out a new 
stimulus package to help pull the economy out of recession, and 
from drafting the fiscal 1994 budget. 
  The Finance Ministry also appears happy with the compromise 
as it has been working against the clock on mapping out a 
blueprint for the budget before a February 11 Japan-U.S. summit. 
  Tokyo has been under pressure to carry out an income tax cut 
as a way to boost the economy and thereby create demand for 
imports to rectify the bilateral trade gap. 
  Indications are that the ministry is looking to present its 
budget blueprint on February 10, the day before the Japan-U.S. 
Summit, in hopes that the government can adopt the fiscal 1994 
budget around February 25.

  The opening shot shows Kono followed by Hosokawa stepping 
up to separate podiums in an unidentified room in the Diet 
building in Tokyo. 
  At 1549 GMT, Kono makes introductory remarks explaining how 
he and Hosokawa came to hold discussions after being called to 
separate meetings with House of Representatives Speaker Takako 
Doi. He says: "We held very lengthy discussions starting around 
1900 hours [1000 GMT] last night." "After reporting to lower 
house Speaker Doi and upper house Speaker Bunbe Hara and gaining 
their approval, we made further progress in our talks and were 
able to reach an agreement on the four political reform bills," 
he adds. Kono then says: "We both would like to sign this 
agreement in front of all of you who have gathered here. Will 
Mr. Prime Minister please sign first?" 
  At 1551 GMT, Kono hands a pen to Hosokawa who then signs the 
agreement. While Hosokawa is signing, Kono says: "The agreement 
is comprised of the main text and 10 topics." 
  After he finishes signing the agreement, Hosokawa hands the 
pen to Kono who then signs. 
  The signing ceremony ends at 1551 GMT and is immediately 
followed by statements by both men.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 28 KYODO -- The government should 
formulate a new economic stimulus package and another 
supplementary budget to finance it, regardless of the fate of 
political reform bills, Japan's top economic planner said Friday 
[28 January]. 
  Manae Kubota, Economic Planning Agency director general, 
called for maximum efforts both by the ruling coalition and the 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party to reach a compromise on 
political reforms before the current Diet session ends Saturday. 
But even if such a compromise was not reached, the government 
should not give up fulfilling its minimum responsibility of 
achieving the task of reviving the ailing economy, she told a 
regular news conference. 
  Kubota said she hopes a joint economic forum between the 
government and parties in the ruling coalition will meet this 
weekend, regardless of whether political reform bills are 
scrapped. 
  She also said the cabinet of Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa 
should not resign even if the reform bills fail to secure Diet 
passage, because such an action would not serve the interests of 
the Japanese people. 
  In view of the current political confusion, formation of the 
main budget for fiscal 1994 will be delayed "substantially," 
Kubota said. She urged the government to bring in another 
supplementary budget, which would be the third for fiscal 1993, 
ending March 31.

  [Text] Fukuoka, Jan. 28 KYODO -- A business leader Friday 
[28 January] urged the coalition government to pass the fiscal 
1994 budget through the Diet under the current administration of 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa even if controversial political 
reform bills are aborted. Even if Hosokawa's political reform 
bills are killed, said Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan 
Federation of Employers' Association (Nikkeiren), "it would be 
irresponsible (for Hosokawa) to dissolve the house without even 
compiling the budget for the next fiscal year." 
  Noting that two prime ministers in the past resigned after 
their political reform bills failed in the Diet, Nagano said 
Japan would lose its international credibility if Hosokawa 
follows such a course just two weeks before the summit meeting 
with U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  The Hosokawa administration's political reform package is on 
the verge of collapse following a rejection of the bills by the 
House of Councillors last week.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 28 KYODO -- Japan's jobless rate in 
December rose to a seasonally adjusted 2.9 percent, the highest 
in about six and a half years, while the ratio of job openings 
to seekers stood at an adjusted 0.65, unchanged from November, 
government reports said Friday [28 January]. 
  The December unemployment rate increased 0.1 percentage 
point 
from November, the fourth consecutive, identical monthly rise 
since September. The figure is the highest since 3.0 percent 
registered in June 1987, the Management and Coordination Agency 
said. 
  The jobless ratio for all of 1993 grew 0.3 point from the 
previous year to 2.5 percent, the highest in five years since 
1988, the agency said. 
  The figure of 0.65 in the job openings ratio resulted from 
an 
adjusted 0.9 percent fall in the number of job offers from 
November and a 0.4 percent drop in the number of job seekers, 
the Labor Ministry said. 
  December's unemployment rate came to 2.7 percent for men, 
down 0.1 point from the previous month, and 3.1 percent for 
women, up 0.3 point. 
  The monthly number of jobless people stood at 1.75 million, 
up 21.5 percent or 310,000 from a year before. The total figure 
comprises 1.02 million men and 730,000 women. 
  The number of jobless in 1993 was 1.66 million, up 16.9 
percent, or 240,000 from the preceding year. 
  The number of employed in December reached 64.32 million, up 
0.2 percent or 100,000 from a year before, in a turnaround from 
a 40,000 decrease posted in November. 
  The size of Japan's work force, including the unemployed, 
stood at 66.07 million in December, up 0.6 percent or 410,000 
from a year earlier. 
  By industry, construction jobs rose 3.2 percent from a year 
before, while those in manufacturing fell 1.9 percent, remaining 
in the minus column since November 1992. 
  Jobs in the wholesale, retail and food services sector 
dipped 
0.1 percent, the first drop in three months, while jobs in 
services increased 2.7 percent. 
  The Labor Ministry said work openings in December decreased 
30.6 percent in manufacturing, 20.3 percent in the wholesale, 
retail and food services sector, 13.3 percent in transportation 
and telecommunications and 12.2 percent in services. Job 
offers, on the other hand, increased 4.7 percent in the 
construction sector. 
  For the full 1993, the job opening ratio came to 0.76, down 
0.32 point from 1.08 the previous year. The number of job 
offers for 1993 dropped 17.9 percent while that of job seekers 
grew 16.5 percent.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 28 KYODO -- The Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI) said Friday [28 January] 
it will ease a rule limiting installment plans for credit cards 
as part of the government's deregulation policy. 
  Starting from April 1, the range of stores allowed to be 
members of such payment plans will be expanded gradually for 
credit cards issued by distributors and manufacturers, MITI 
officials said. At present, agents that can handle installment 
plans for card issuers in the two sectors are limited to stores 
in which the issuer has a 20 percent stake or more. 
  Under the new step, the scope will be expanded to include 
stores having any ratio of capital relations with an issuer, 
those with a franchising contract with an issuer and those 
agreeing to use a shop name designated by an issuer and agreeing 
to sell goods produced by the issuer, the officials said. 
  Convenience stores affiliated with supermarket chains and 
sales outlets of electrical appliance makers will be allowed to 
engage in installment plans under the new rule, they said. The 
measure is one of 94 deregulation items envisaged in the 
government's pump-priming package released in September last 
year. The rule restricting installment plans will be completely 
abolished in April 1995, they added.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 28 KYODO -- Japan's industrial 
production in December fell 1.7 percent from the previous month, 
a turnaround from a 2.2 percent gain in November, the Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry said Friday [28 January]. 
  The seasonally adjusted production index for the mining and 
manufacturing sectors came to 88.0 against the base 100 for 
1990, the ministry said in a preliminary report. 
  The index was the second-lowest under the 1990 base, 
introduced in May last year, after 87.6 registered last October. 
  Shipments in December decreased 0.3 percent for an index 
figure of 89.7, also a shift from a 1.0 percent growth in 
November. 
  The inventory index declined 0.8 percent to 108.4, following 
a 0.8 percent rise in November. 
  The December inventory-to-sales ratio rose 1.3 percent 
against a 0.5 percent slide in November, with the index standing 
at 125.6. 
  Industrial output has been seeing ups and downs alternately 
in the past five months -- a 1.2 percent fall in August, a 2.2 
percent gain in September and a 5.5 percent slide in October, 
the largest- ever decline. 
  On an unadjusted basis, industrial production in December 
slid 4.2 percent from a year before for the 27th successive 
month of decline, the longest ever losing streak.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 27 KYODO -- Japan's imports of crude 
oil in 1993 rose 1.6 percent from the year before to 1,604.83 
million barrels for the sixth straight yearly rise, the Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry said in a preliminary report 
Thursday [27 January]. 
  The United Arab Emirates was the largest crude supplier with 
shipments of 383.78 million barrels, up 4.1 percent. It was 
followed by Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Iran. Middle East 
nations accounted for 76.3 percent of Japan's total crude oil 
imports. 
  Imports of fuel oil dropped 13.8 percent to 178.26 million 
barrels and exports of it grew 20.9 percent to 96.55 million 
barrels. 
  Domestic sales of fuel oil slipped 0.8 percent to 1,420.60 
million barrels, posting an annual decline for the first time in 
eight years, the ministry said. The downswing was attributed to 
sluggish demand for fuel oil C, reflecting lower demand for 
thermal power due to the cool summer and factory closures amid 
the economic slump. 
  Production of fuel oil came to 1,360.53 million barrels, up 
3.0 percent for the sixth straight yearly rise. 
  The ministry said Japan's imports of crude oil in December 
fell 9.1 percent from a year before to 137.37 million barrels, 
marking the fifth successive month of year-on-year drops. The 
largest supplier of crude in December was the United Arab 
Emirates at 36.54 million barrels, followed by Saudi Arabia and 
Iran. 
  December imports of fuel oil fell 9.9 percent to 14.40 
million barrels but exports advanced 28.4 percent to 11.32 
million barrels. 
  Domestic sales of fuel oil rose 1.3 percent to 145.05 
million 
barrels, the first increase in eight months. 
  Production of fuel oil scored the fifth straight month of 
year-on-year rises, up 4.0 percent to 131.21 million barrels.

  [Text] Hanoi, Jan 28 (AFP) -- The U.S. Senate vote in favor 
of lifting the economic embargo against Vietnam is "a positive 
gesture," the Vietnamese foreign ministry said Friday. 
  "The fact that the U.S. Senate has voted in favor of lifting 
the embargo by President Bill Clinton is a positive gesture that 
corresponds to international reality and the wishes of the 
American people," a ministry spokesman said. 
  "We believe that this vote will enjoy substantial approval 
among American and world opinion," according to the ministry, 
which reacted particularly rapidly. 
  The Senate voted 62 to 38 in favor of lifting the sanctions 
imposed against Vietnam in 1975. The issue now moves to Clinton 
for his decision. 
  Last week, Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai said 
the 
embargo was a domestic American affair, saying that Vietnam has 
already cooperated fully in trying to resolve the issue of 2,238 
US soldiers missing in action (MIA) in Indochina. The MIAs 
remain the final obstacle to the lifting of sanctions.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 27 KYODO -- The U.S. is ready to propose 
that the next round of global trade talks focus on competition 
policy, a broad term that includes better enforcement of 
anti-trust laws, according to a think-tank close to the 
administration of President Bill Clinton. 
  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor "is ready to 
announce 
that competition policy should be the next main agenda for the 
next GATT round," Keio University Associate Professor Jiro 
Tamura, a participant in the Brookings Institution competition 
policy project, told a seminar sponsored by the Japanese 
American Citizens League. 
  Tamura later told a journalist he was informed by a chief 
economist at the Washington-based think-tank earlier in the day 
that Kantor "looks like" he is going to propose competition 
policy as the new theme for the next round of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT.) 
  The last round of the 117-nation trade organization was 
finally concluded last month after seven years of negotiations. 
Tamura said trade negotiators are likely to meet toward the end 
of this year to mull over a topic for the next round, which will 
be conducted under the World Trade Organization (WTO), the new 
name for the GATT umbrella organization. 
  Competition policy is a broad concept that includes better 
enforcement of anti-trust laws so that companies will compete 
with each other in a free and fair manner, he said. The term 
would include crackdowns on cartels and mergers, and restrictive 
business practices. 
  Tamura told the seminar on Japan-U.S. relations in 1994 that 
anti-competitive practices such as company-led boycotts, where 
manufacturers agree not to provide products to discounters to 
drive them out of business, have been common in Japan. But he 
said that the U.S. approach to enforcing anti-trust laws is not 
suitable for Japan because of a tradition of cozy ties between 
regulators and industry. 
  "The confrontational approach in this country just doesn't 
work," said Tamura, an adviser to Japan's Fair Trade Commission 
(FTC). 
  Tamura said the FTC has been relatively ineffective in part 
because powerful bureaucracies such as the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry and the Finance Ministry have 
been uncooperative in the interest of protecting their turf. 
  For competition policy to be successfully implemented in 
Japan, the powerful ministries must be given a role in carrying 
it out, he said.

  [Text] A draft agreement to be proposed by Japan during 
the auto and auto parts talks -- which has been the focus of 
attention of the deadlocked Japan-U.S. economic framework talks 
-- came to light on 18 January. In addition to such additional 
measures as promoting imports of finished automobiles, the draft 
agreement includes "the number of dealers selling imported 
autos" as an "objective criteria" to measure the openness of 
Japan's market. The draft agreement will be presented at vice 
ministerial talks set to begin in Washington on 21 January. 
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] 
plans 
to provide a breakthrough in the deadlocked negotiations by 
improving the condition for sales of finished imported autos in 
Japan, and by giving shape to an objective criteria -- designed 
to assess efforts by Japanese and American manufacturers -- as 
an index which will help promote access by foreign companies to 
Japan's market. However, according to MITI's International 
Trade Policy Bureau, Japan still maintains "it is impossible to 
compromise on such proposals as establishing an objective 
criteria, which Japan says leads to establishing numerical 
targets, and giving favorable treatment to 
non-Japanese-affiliated makers because these proposals run 
counter to the principle of a free trade system." For that 
reason, the talks seem to face rough sailing. 
  As part of the measures to promote imports of finished 
autos, 
Japan plans to propose expanding the loan ceiling of the 
Export-Import Bank of Japan [EIBJ] and the Japan Development 
Bank [JDB] as well as improving tax incentives to promote 
imports of finished autos. In addition, to increase imports of 
U.S.-made auto parts, which is held in check due to the sluggish 
auto market, Japan plans to expand loans by the EIBJ and JDB and 
release a list of U.S.-made auto parts which meet the standards 
applied to auto repairs and inspections. 
  As an objective criteria to measure the United States' 
efforts, the draft agreement proposes the United States should 
lower the prices of auto parts made by American companies and 
increase types of cars having the steering wheel on the right 
hand side. As Japan's objective criteria, the agreement 
proposes to promote research projects in the United States and 
increase the number of individual business talks.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Make Japan-U.S. Economic Framework Talks </F>
Successful"] 
  [Text] Japan-U.S. summit talks will be held on 11 February 
and this date is a deadline for the two countries to reach an 
agreement to correct trade imbalance between them. With the 
approaching deadline, however, Japan-U.S. economic framework 
talks remain deadlocked. 
  Growing economic friction between Japan and the United 
States 
will be more injurious than beneficial not only to the two 
countries, but to the entire world. We hope that the two 
countries will view the situation calmly and continue to make 
maximum efforts to address the bilateral trade imbalance. 
  Treasury Secretary Bentsen, who was on a tour of Asian 
nations, abruptly stopped in Japan at President Clinton's 
request, and his surprise visit to Japan reflected deep concern 
the United States has over the deadlock in the Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks. 
  Treasury Secretary Bentsen met separately with Prime 
Minister 
Hosokawa and Finance Minister Fujii on 23 January. During the 
meetings, he asked the Japanese Government to work for fruitful 
trade agreements and take aggressive fiscal measures to expand 
domestic demand. Speaking at a news conference, he hinted at the 
possibility of reviewing the basis for the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks, saying, "If agreements hammered out at the 
economic framework are inadequate, it would be better not to 
hold such talks." 
  At the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, both sides have 
agreed to treat government procurement, insurance, and 
automobile-auto parts as priority sectors and they have worked 
to reach agreements on the priority sectors by 11 February when 
Japan-U.S. summit talks are held. The United States still asks 
for setting numerical targets as an objective criteria to 
measure how wide the Japanese market is open. Treasury Secretary 
Bentsen confirmed the U.S. request in his statement. 
  In response, Japan has persistently refused to accept the 
U.S. demand for setting the numerical targets since last autumn 
when the first round of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks 
was held, arguing that "setting such numerical targets will lead 
to managed trade." The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks have 
made almost little progress from the "beginning." 
  It is hard to understand the method of setting numerical 
targets one by one in advance in order to promote market 
opening. Asian and European nations are guarding against the 
possibility of Japan and the United States tying up to shut 
third nations out of the Japanese market. 
  Setting targets for the expansion of the trade of individual 
items is a matter to be judged independently by enterprises. A 
government should not step into that matter. Prominent American 
economists have sent their letters to leaders of Japan and the 
Untied States, arguing against setting such numerical targets. 
Perhaps, they have been motivated by the above rationale. 
  As for access by individual sectors to the Japanese market, 
how about assessing Japan's imports six months or a year after 
it takes bold measures to stimulate its economy? 
  The United States has stuck to its demand for setting the 
numerical targets because of a "successful example" in the 
Japan- U.S. Semiconductor Agreement under which Japan is said to 
have committed itself to a 20 percent of market share. If Japan 
is in recession, its enterprises would be unable to meet such 
numerical targets. This foolish arrangement should not be 
repeated. 
  What is most important in order to avert a showdown between 
Japan and the United States over individual sectors is for Japan 
to speedily decide on stimulus measures. If Japan further delays 
taking the stimulus measures, it would undermine its 
international trustworthiness. To that end, it should carry out 
political reform at the earliest date. 
  Prime Minister Hosokawa should display his leadership in and 
make decisions on cutting the income tax prior to raising the 
consumption tax, compiling a budget for fiscal 1994 with 
priority given to the improved livelihood of people, taking 
monetary measures and tax incentives to spur land transactions 
and enforcing deregulation in ways that it generates immediate 
effects. The prime minister should make urgent efforts to spread 
a transparent tender system not only for public works projects, 
but for government procurement. 
  Japan should remove barriers to its market, while trying to 
recover its economy steadily whereas the United States should 
strengthen efforts to develop and manufacture goods that are 
salable on the Japanese market. The two countries should keep 
this principle in mind.

  [Text] Vice Chairman Isamu Yamakawa and other 
representatives of the Okinawa Peace Movement Center visited 
Choko Takayama, head of the governor's office, on 19 January and 
asked him to exert efforts to petition for the discontinuation 
of live-shelling exercises across Prefectural Highway 104, and 
to stop construction on the P3C communications station. Seishu 
Miyazato, Japan Communist Party member of the Prefectural 
Assembly, also asked Takayama to stop the live-shelling 
exercises. 
  Yamakawa and his party protested the prefectural 
government's 
proceeding with construction work for the P3C communications 
station. They criticized the prefectural government for this, 
saying: "We cannot permit the construction of a new military 
base. Sneaky construction work amounts to a betrayal. I hope 
you work harder to realize the governor's peace ideals." 
  Protesting the U.S. Forces' live-shelling exercises, 
Miyazato 
said: "The prefectural assembly has repeatedly asked that such 
exercises be stopped. The discontinuation of the exercises is 
the consensus of the Okinawan people." He asked the prefectural 
government to take measures concerning this problem. Takayama 
replied that he plans to petition for stopping the exercises 
with the U.S. Forces Okinawa, the U.S. Consulate, and the Naha 
Defense Facilities Administration Bureau shortly.

<F P=106> [Article by journalist Akira Kato: "North Korea Already Has </F>
Nuclear Weapons -- Classified Document of the Russian Defense 
Ministry Obtained"] 
  [Text] The international community has suspected North 
Korea of developing nuclear weapons and I recently obtained a 
document decisively proving that it already possesses nuclear 
weapons. The document is a formal report compiled by the Russian 
Government which long helped North Korea develop nuclear 
technology. 
  The document is entitled: "The Russian Federation's Basic 
Military and Political Concept on the Current Military Situation 
in the Asian and Pacific Region." 
  The document is a classified report that was compiled on 22 
October 1993 by the Russian Federation's Defense Ministry for 
Defense Minister Grachev. 
  The report, compiled by the Military Strategy Research 
Center 
under the General Staff of the Armed Forces, was also submitted 
to the Russian Government leaders. According to information I 
have obtained, the report has been sent to the U.S. Defense 
Department at President Yeltsin's instruction. In other words, 
the report is not a highly classified document. As the title 
indicates, the report proposes Russia's strategic blueprint for 
all of Asia. What draws our attention in the report is North 
Korea's nuclear development. It devotes five pages out of 36 to 
North Korea's nuclear development. 
  The report gives a general picture of North Korea's nuclear 
development. 
  It says: "The Democratic People's Republic of Korea [DPRK] 
has announced its decision to pull out of the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the DPRK has test-fired 
medium-range ballistic missiles. It has also refused to allow 
nuclear inspections by the committee of the international atomic 
organization [name as received]. These moves by the DPRK have 
heightened the potentially tense situation in the region." 
  The report also indicates that North Korea's threat to the 
security of Russia, the United States, and Japan is drastically 
growing. 
  What is of great interest to the Japanese is a section on 
page 20 of the report. The section was written about North 
Korea's nuclear development for senior officers of the General 
Staff of the Armed Forces and Russian Government leaders. 
  The section entitled "Technology Information" says: Now, 
nine 
people with Russian citizenship are working as nuclear 
physicists in North Korea. Seventeen experts are working on the 
missile manufacturing technology and four of them recently 
returned to their countries. 
  Soviet experts were most active in North Korea in the later 
half of the 1980's. At that time, North Korea was engaged in 
developing Nodong-1 medium-range ballistic missile with the 
direct assistance of the Soviet Union. The Nodong-1 weighs 
1,000-1,500 kg with a warhead tip. The missile has a range of 
1,000-1,600 km with a 100-200 meter margin of hit probability. 
Its explosive warhead ranges from one to two megatons. The 
warhead is of the Hiroshima type. The missile flies at the 
maximum speed of more than Mach nine and tipping the missile 
with nuclear warheads is in the final stage. 
  At the same time, North Korea is developing Nodong-2. The 
major task for North Korea is to improve the performance of the 
Nodong-2 -- extension of range and miniaturization of warheads. 
  According to the report, North Korea now has 10-12 kg of 
uranium-235 and 20 kg of plutonium-239. According to Russian 
nuclear experts, they are enough to manufacture three to five 
nuclear warheads. The massive nuclear complex is located in 
Yongbyun, 90 km north of Pyongyang. The Soviet Union provided 
North Korea with a centrifugal separator which is capable of 
greatly increasing the effect of enriched uranium. 
  The report describes North Korea's suspected nuclear 
development as in the "final stage" which has attracted 
attention of the American and European journalists and the 
world. Since the report is an official document that the Russian 
military, which continued to help North Korea's nuclear 
development, compiled on the basis of interviews with Russian 
engineers who returned home from North Korea, it is 100 percent 
reliable. 
  In an interview with me, a senior officer with the Military 
Strategy Research Center under the General Staff of the Armed 
Forces, which compiled the report, gave details of North Korea's 
nuclear development. In the interview, he revealed not only the 
existence of nuclear arms in North Korea, but fearful facts. The 
following are questions and answers: 
  [Unidentified officer] "In my view, nuclear inspections are 
a 
ridiculous story. North Korea has already completed the 
development of Hiroshima-type atomic bomb and it is widely known 
among us that North Korea has at least one atomic bomb. The 
North Koreans are using Russian scientists to promote the 
manufacturing of a few atomic bombs according to the `Nuclear 
Development Project' which they have worked out on their own. 
Perhaps they have already completed manufacturing them." 
  "According to an analysis by Soviet nuclear physicists in 
1992, it was said that North Korea was promoting a plan designed 
to produce at least three atomic bombs, similar to the atomic 
bomb dropped on Hiroshima, by the end of 1994. Therefore, it is 
highly possible that they have already finished building a bomb 
or two." 
  [Kato] What makes you so positive? 
  [Unidentified officer] "It is a matter of common knowledge 
that the former Soviet government supplied low level radioactive 
materials to the north. However, North Koreans are enriching 
these materials and producing high-grade uranium and plutonium 
by using centrifugal separators, which the former Soviet Union 
gave to North Korea, at an underground nuclear reprocessing 
plant in Yongbyun. Moreover, it was confirmed that there are 
several rich uranium veins in the north. 
  In the past, the Soviet Union provided North Korea with 
uranium mining knowhow and technicians as well. The Soviet 
Union did all that for smooth promotion of nuclear development 
in North Korea. Because of the help from the Soviet Union, the 
north now has 20 kilograms of plutonium. Roughly speaking, it 
is possible to make one nuclear warhead if you have eight 
kilograms of plutonium. Judging from the quantity of plutonium 
they have, I do not think my view is far from the truth. 
However, we know the details and actual conditions of the 
development program because we have interviewed scientists who 
came back from there." 
  [Kato] But, Russia is officially saying it is not supporting 
North Korean nuclear development. 
  [Unidentified officer] "That is right but the fact is 
different. As is written in the report, Russian technicians are 
engaged in North Korean nuclear development. They get paid 
$3,000 or $4,000 per month. In addition, they are given high 
quality houses, cars, clothes, and other daily necessities. 
They are given special treatment. The total number of Russian 
technicians, who were sent to North Korea, was well over 100. 
However, some of them are not coming back. They are staying 
there and obtaining North Korean citizenship and changing their 
names. Now, you understand that the scientists were not ordered 
by the government to go to Pyongyang. We know all about their 
movements, including the number of scientists who emigrated to 
third nations after they went to Pyongyang." 
  [Kato] According to a news report, it is said the Nodong-1 
will be deployed soon. Is that true? 
  [Unidentified officer] "After the experimental launching of 
the Nodong-1 in the Sea of Japan on 29 May last year, several 
missiles, including a new remote control system which was 
successfully produced, were sold to Iran. However, judging from 
this fact, there is no doubt that North Korea is steadily 
perfecting its missile development." 
  He also disclosed surprising facts. 
  "Currently, North Korea has three different kinds of 
missiles, which are capable of carrying nuclear warheads. They 
are Scud-A, B and C types which were manufactured in the north 
under a production license, and they have 300 such missiles in 
all. The missile, called Nodong in Japan, is called Tsurudo [as 
published] in Russia. Its capabilities are written in the 
report. However, what we should pay attention to is the 
Nodong-2, which North Korea is developing as a weapon to replace 
Nodong-1. Reportedly, the flight range of the Nodong-2 is 6,000 
kilometers. Therefore, we can say it is a real intercontinental 
ballistic missile [ICBM]. Of course, it will be capable of 
attacking not only the entire Asian region but also part of the 
United States." 
  [Kato] Just a minute. Why does North Korea need an ICBM? 
  [Unidentified officer] "We do not know that for sure. 
However, we can take a guess. Probably, the Gulf war became a 
motive. That is because Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il saw 
Tomahawk's attack the Iraqi military with pinpoint accuracy 
during the war and clearly realized that North Korea will 
immediately suffer crushing blows once it engages in a war. 
They do not need to develop missiles which have the same 
capabilities as American rockets. However, I suppose they 
immediately started to develop the Nodong-2, feeling the need to 
own an ICBM to use as a long-range assault weapon." 
  [Kato] Does that mean the Gulf war made North Korea change 
its missile development plan? Do you have some concrete 
evidence? 
  [Unidentified officer] "Of course. Previously, North Korea 
was using a liquid fuel method for all of its missile 
development. However, the Gulf war revealed that this method had 
a fatal defect. It was proved that missile bases, no matter how 
well they are hidden underground, are helpless against cruise 
missile attacks as long as their locations are known. 
  "For that reason, Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il have 
reportedly made an urgent decision to develop solid-fuel-type 
rockets like the SCUD missiles developed by Iraq. It may be 
safe to say that their decision is proved by the fact that the 
North has recently asked the Russian Defense Ministry through 
the Moscow Embassy in North Korea to provide it with more 
advanced missile development technology, including know-how of 
developing missiles with the sold fuel type method. Whatever 
the case may be, North Korea's demand concerning ICBM 
development technology is persistent and urgent." 
  If what the senior officer said is true, not only Japan but 
also all other nations will be exposed to the nuclear threat of 
Kim Il-song. In fact, reportedly, the United States and Russia, 
fearing North Korea's suspected nuclear development, have 
already started preparing for the North Korean threat. 
  Actually, the senior officer said the report described above 
has been written on the assumption that the world will be 
exposed to North Korea's nuclear threat. 
  As he said, the report emphasizes that Japan, the United 
States, and Russia should jointly cope with the North Korean 
threat. 
  The following are the major points of the report: 
  1) Within the Russian military authorities, there are some 
groups cooperating with North Korea in nuclear development. 
  2) It is impossible to ensure the future security of 
Russia without joint cooperation with Japan, the United States, 
and South Korea. 
  3) Should the military authorities cooperate with North 
Korea, it would double Japan's and South Korea's distrust of 
Russia. Therefore, in view of ensuring security, it is extremely 
dangerous to cooperate with North Korea. 
  4) In particular, Russia's relations with Japan are 
important to improving its relations with the United States, and 
Russia should not incite Japan. 
  5) Russia's plan to establish a regional missile 
interception network in cooperation with the United States and 
Japan is for regional defense purposes. Therefore, it is absurd 
to cooperate with North Korea in nuclear development. 
  In conclusion, the report even proposes that the outflow to 
North Korea of Russian experts for missile development, of 
materials for missile development, and nuclear resources should 
be prevented; that an accord between Russia and North Korea on 
missile development technology should be abolished; and that 
Russia should not help North Korea smuggle its missiles to the 
third countries. 
  The senior officer also disclosed another astonishing fact. 
  He said: "Concerned over the threat of North Korea, 
including 
nuclear attack in the Far East and the Pacific region, Japan's 
Defense Agency, the Russian Defense Ministry, and the U.S. 
Department of Defense are conducting meetings to seek a possible 
tripartite emergency defense system aimed at coping with a North 
Korean missile attack. 
  "Particularly, they have agreed that it is necessary to 
urgently come up with measures to deal with ICBM missiles which 
North Korea is developing secretly. 
  "As far as I know, when the summit was held, (then) Director 
General of the Defense Agency Nakanishi, who accompanied Prime 
Minister Hosokawa on his visit to Vancouver, reportedly met with 
a high-raking official of the U.S. Department of Defense and 
obtained information on progress in North Korea's nuclear 
development. 
  "Meanwhile, a high-ranking Japanese Defense Agency official 
visited Moscow, and his visit was briefly reported by ITAR-TASS 
saying a meeting was held between Japanese and Russian defense 
officials. However, in fact, at the meeting, in-depth 
discussions were held on such topics as progress in North 
Korea's nuclear development, and its strike capability. 
  "At the meeting, they agreed to hold a Japan-Russia meeting 
of defense officials in Tokyo around February 1994 (recently the 
meeting was scheduled for 1-2 February). When the meeting is 
held, Russia will bring a more detailed, precise report on North 
Korea's military power. Actually, the Military Strategy 
Research Center has been ordered to work out a report needed for 
the meeting." 
  It is true that former Director-General of the Defense 
Agency 
Nakanishi was eager to develop a Theater Missile Defense (TMD) 
system jointly with the United States. It is also true that 
after Prime Minister Hosokawa's visit to the United States for 
the summit meeting, Japanese ministries and agencies concerned 
with North Korean issues have started seriously studying 
possible economic sanctions against North Korea. 
  I think it is time for the Japanese Government to tell the 
people about how nuclear bombs and missiles are being developed 
by North Korea because the North Korean issue directly affects 
the future security of Japan. Meanwhile, the government is 
seeking a new framework for security. The situation is getting 
serious, and for Japan, this is no time to be carried away by 
"Hosokawa's performance." 
  The senior officer also said: "Russia is not the only 
country 
which provides North Korea with nuclear resources. You probably 
do not know that China has been cooperating with North Korea. 
It has been confirmed that a great volume of uranium has been 
brought in to North Korea only recently. 
  "It is said the source of that uranium is factories in 
Mordai 
[as published] and Choera [as published] in China. If so, 
nuclear material brought in to North Korea must be low-level 
radioactive material. However, if it is so inclined, North 
Korea can collect nuclear development and materials know-how. 
  "What you should not forget is the fact that North Korea 
already has at least one atomic bomb and 1,000-kilometer range 
missiles."

  [Text] On 20 January, Kong No-myong, South Korean 
ambassador to Japan, visited Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata at 
the Foreign Ministry and officially informed him that President 
Kim Yong-sam wants to visit Japan this spring. 
  In response, Foreign Minister Hata explained his intention 
to 
welcome the president, saying: "Since Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa also wants to talk with President Kim soon, I will talk 
to him about the schedule for the visit." Regarding President 
Kim's visit to Japan, the leaders of both countries reached 
agreement at the Japan-ROK summit talks held in Kyongju last 
November. 
  It seems that President Kim's trip to Japan will be realized 
in March, at the earliest. 
  Moreover, Foreign Minister Hata touched on the issue of 
North 
Korean nuclear development and said: "We should not isolate 
North Korea. We need to do our best to make them open the 
door." In this way, he explained his willingness to resume 
negotiations for normalization of Japan-DPRK diplomatic ties. 
At the same time the foreign minister also said: "We will keep 
an eye on how (North Korea) buckles down to the task of economic 
reform."

  [Text] Following the announcement of the new Russian 
cabinet lineup, the Foreign Ministry decided to review a portion 
of Japan's economic aid to Russia. Japan will maintain an 
outline of bilateral support, such as the $1.8 billion in aid 
that Japan promised to Russia in April. However, as for 
emergency and humanitarian aid, including food and medical 
supplies, the Foreign Ministry will carefully select Russian 
Government agencies eligible for such aid and study whether aid 
is needed at all. 
  This was disclosed by a senior Foreign Ministry official on 
the morning of 21 January. As for the plan to review economic 
aid to Russia, the same official pointed out that "we have no 
choice but to scale down the monetary and financial measures of 
the past" because of the resignation of Gaydar, first deputy 
prime minister and economic minister, who had been promoting the 
radical introduction of a market economy, and former Deputy 
Prime Minister Fedorov's refusal to become a cabinet member. He 
also explained that some people are concerned about the 
possibility that the escalating trend in Russia of seeking 
"major-power chauvinism" may create "antipathy against 
`handouts' termed humanitarian aid."

<F P=106> [By Norikazu Tsujino] </F>
  [Text] A large-scale project for improving Da Nang City in 
the central part of Vietnam and turning it into a key 
Indochinese port has suddenly surfaced, and the Vietnamese 
Government has decided to launch a development project by 
requesting cooperation from various nations such as Japan, a 
superpower that has provided enormous funds as the Official 
Development Assistance (ODA). In respone to this request, Japan 
will study the possibility of providing full-scale aid on the 
basis of the "Fukuda Doctrine," which advocates Japan's aid to 
Southeast Asia. Da Nang City is also included in another 
project for building a highway, which will start from suburban 
Bangkok and reach Vietnam via Laos. Therefore, when these 
projects are completed, a new gateway to Indochina from the sea 
that may function equally as Bangkok, will appear in central 
Vietnam. 
  Vietnam is a country consisting of a long strip of land that 
extends south and north, and it can be roughly divided into the 
Hanoi-centered northern region; the Ho Chi Minh-centered 
southern region; and the central region in between. However, 
since development and investment have been concentrated on the 
northern and southern regions, they have fallen behind in the 
central region. 
  Da Nang City, with a population of about half a million, is 
known for the fact that military facilities, such as naval ports 
and airports, were built by the U.S. forces during the Vietnam 
war, and the city's outer port is known as an excellent natural 
port. However, since these facilities have not been fully 
utilized for trade, serious deterioration in the economy has 
been noted recently. 
  Meanwhile, due to the rapid growth of the Asian economy, the 
Thai Government, which is concerned with the overcrowded 
situation at Bangkok port, has started paying its attention to 
Da Nang port, which is geographically accessible. This year, 
the Thai Government has made a proposal for using the Da Nang 
port on various occassions such as during its influnetial 
ministers' visits to Vietnam and at a forum sponsored by the 
Asian Development Bank. Realizing the importance of the 
comprehensive development in the central region, including Da 
Nang port, the Vietnamese Government has also started working 
out its own development program. 
  Aside from the proposal for developing Da Nang port, the 
Thai 
Government is also studying another "Indochinese Gateway" 
project. Based on the recommendations of the Japan International 
Cooperation Agency, this project aims at building a highway, 
which will connect a new industrial port located east of Bangkok 
with northeast Thailand and Laos. Since this project is 
believed to cover even Da Nang City in Vietnam, it will 
eventually be linked with the Vietnamese Government's program 
for developing its central region in a comprehensive way. 
  In 1977, then Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda announced in 
Manila 
the "Fukuda Doctrine," which promises Japan's overall 
cooperation in developing Southeast Asia. Since then, Japan has 
been promoting its diplomacy toward Southeast Asia based on this 
doctrine. When Japan became once again the biggest ODA supplier 
in 1992, it spent most of its ODA aid, amounting to $11.33 
billion, in Southeast Asia and East Asia. 
  However, due to such issues as sanctions against the 
Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia and its delayed payment to the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Japanese Government 
stopped providing its aid to Vietnam for 14 years up to November 
1992. Therefore, economic aid to Vietnam has been almost 
overlooked. In particular, no nations, including Japan, have 
ever provided any full-scale economic aid to Vietnam's central 
region. 
  Since a large gap in the economic growth has recently been 
observed between the central region on the one hand and the 
northern and southern regions on the other, it is observed that 
from a long-term viewpoint, it has become indispensable for 
Vietnam to work out a master plan for developing its central 
region.

  [Text] Following the decision to accept partial 
liberalization of the Japanese rice market from 1995, the 
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry [AFFM] firmed up 
its plan on 20 January to create a new emergency storage system, 
designed to adjust supply and demand of rice over several years. 
Unlike the current method, which includes rice in stock at the 
end of the rice crop year in the supply plan of the following 
year, the new system aims to flexibly adjust supply and demand, 
and to deal with future rice shortages. Adjustment will be made 
by combining foreign rice, which will be imported through 
partial liberalization, and domestic rice. It seems that about 
1.5 million tons of rice will be stored for sudden needs. 
Decisions regarding the volume of rice in stock for emergency 
needs, the method of operation, and other matters will be made 
around this fall after discussions at an agricultural and 
administrative council meeting, which will start as early as the 
end of this month. 
  Currently, the AFFM is adjusting supply and demand of rice 
through measures for reducing acreage of rice paddies. This is 
a "method for maintaining the balance between demand and supply 
for a single fiscal year." The ministry has been trying to 
maintain about one million tons of rice in stock in preparation 
for bad harvests. However, the limited effect of this system was 
revealed when Japan had its record-breaking bad crop last year. 
On the other hand, some people are worried that Japan will have 
an excessive amount of rice because a certain volume of rice 
will be imported for six years following the decision made at 
last year's new multilateral trade negotiations (Uruguay Round) 
to accept minimum access. Outlines of the AFFM's plan are: 1) 
to store a certain amount of rice for emergency needs by 
combining imported rice and domestic rice; 2) to store rice over 
several years regardless of changes in volume of rice in storage 
for emergency needs; and 3) to use rice for foreign aid and for 
processing should the volume of rice in storage exceed a certain 
level.

  [Text] With 17 upper house members of the Social 
Democratic Party [SDPJ] casting `no' votes, the political reform 
bills were defeated in a plenary session of the House of 
Councillors. Opposition to the combination of single-seat 
constituencies and proportional representative erupted suddenly. 
To the government and the ruling parties, it was an 
"unexpectedly" deep-rooted opposition. Why did the lawmakers of 
the SDPJ, the largest ruling party, try to kill the bills, on 
which Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa "staked his political 
life?" How did the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] manage to 
restrict to five the number of its upper house members who voted 
for the bills? And what about the behind-the-scenes moves by 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] to get the bills enacted? We 
will look at why the ruling parties lost by a wide margin. 
  The twenty "rebels" from the 73-member upper house SDPJ and 
the Democratic Federation for Safeguarding Constitution [goken 
minshu rengo], who voted against the political reform bills, 
completely reversed the power balance between the ruling and 
opposition parties. Seventeen of them voted against the bills 
and three abstained. This means that a group, an "opposition 
faction," was formed very skillfully without coming to the 
notice of the SDPJ executive council or other coalition parties 
until immediately before voting on the bills. The rebels came 
from all sections of the party, neither bound by age or sex -- 
from senior members to "madonna lawmakers" who won election to 
the upper house for the first time in 1989 when Takako Doi was 
chairperson of the SDPJ. 
  Moreover, Hideo Den, permanent adviser to the Social 
Democratic League who seceded from the SDPJ's "leftist and labor 
union line," and Masatoshi Ito, who was involved in 
"anti-military base struggles" and ran for the post of SDPJ 
chairman last September based on his opposition to the 
combination of single-seat constituencies and proportional 
representation -- also voted against the bills. They have 
different political beliefs and views. 
  We can say that many of the rebels feel a stronger affinity 
with Chairman Tomiichi Murayama than with Secretary General 
Wataru Kubo. Jinichi Ogawa, chairman of the Regional 
Administration Committee and a senior figure among the rebels, 
said: "Each individual had doubts about the bills and decided 
on his or her own will to vote against them." His comment 
showed he thought there was a difference between their group and 
a party faction which might force its members to vote against 
bills. 
  The Japanese Private Sector Trade Union Confederation 
[Rengo] 
and other organizations started to apply serious pressure on 
SDPJ members in mid-January when Diet discussions on the bills 
entered the final stage. The party convention which ended on 12 
January confirmed its resolve that the "bills be approved." 
Once that had happened, the SDPJ's executive department and the 
prime minister's close associates intensified efforts to 
persuade SDPJ upper house members to vote for the bills. At 
that time the party's executive department confirmed that up to 
19 lawmakers would vote against the bills. 
  On 18 January, the ruling and opposition parties started to 
talk about the idea of revising the bills. The concept included 
a plan which would leave some room for corporations and groups 
to make political donations. The executive department tried to 
persuade the rebels to support the concept, saying "the bills 
will be changed for the worse if we continue to oppose this 
idea." As a result, though, the rebels became more distrustful 
of the bills and strengthened their unity. 
  On 20 January, the day before the vote, a rumor leaked 
out that said: "It seems as though Shinseito has managed to 
persuade 10 LDP members to vote for the bills." Lawmakers who 
planned to abstain from voting, firmed up their resolve to vote 
against the bills for the fear they might be approved. Five 
upper house LDP members actually voted for the bills. "Twelve" 
rebellious members, the difference between the `yes' and `no' 
votes, was enough to kill the bills, even though five more LDP 
members than expected voted for them. The figures suggest the 
rebellious SDPJ members had a well-planned strategy. 
  In fact, the rebels had a further strategy. They had a 
secret plan to hold a meeting immediately before the vote to 
deliberate on a resolution to censure Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime 
minister and foreign minister, and Eijiro Hata, agriculture, 
forestry and fisheries minister, following the liberalization of 
the Japanese rice market. According to the plan, several 
lawmakers from agricultural areas, and who align themselves with 
the SDPJ group, would be asked to attend the deliberation 
meeting and thereby abstain from voting on the reform bills. 
Eventually, the LDP gave up the idea of calling for a 
deliberation on the resolution on 22 January. As a result, the 
SDPJ group had to shelve its secret plan. However, it seems 
that dissatisfaction -- including the abstention by Takao 
Mikami, a member of an agricultural cooperative association -- 
over the government's decision to accept liberalization of the 
rice market had some impact on the voting. 
  The opposition faction confirmed: "It is likely that any 20 
people would agree and act in concert on all proposals." 
However, there is no doubt that the opposition faction now has 
the casting vote in the upper house between the LDP and the 
ruling coalition parties. Although there are many tasks to be 
settled, including compilation of the fiscal 1994 budget, the 
positions of the ruling and opposition parties have been 
reversed in the upper house. A senior upper house member of a 
ruling party muttered: "The political reform bills will not be 
approved, no matter how many times we submit them to the upper 
house, as long as the current composition of the upper house 
remains."

<F P=106> [From Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 28 January </F>
Morning Edition] 
  [Text] On 27 January, with three days to go before the 
Diet session adjourns, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa made a 
very risky gamble. At an emergency general meeting of the 
Political Reform Promotion Council (also known as the Private 
Sector Seiji Rincho) on that day, the prime minister said that 
if political reform was not realized, he would not hesitate to 
resign. This was like burning his bridges behind him in a 
"desperate counteroffensive" to preempt moves inside both the 
ruling and opposition parties to scrap the reform bills, and to 
effect a breakthrough in the stalemate through a call to Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] President Yohei Kono to join him for a 
top meeting. Hosokawa, backed by a high popularity rating, 
tried to win public support by appealing to the people directly 
in an attempt to turn the unwholesome tide. Now the talks at 
the joint council of both Diet houses have ended in failure, the 
prime minister is likely to stake the survival of his 
administration on his top-level meeting with Kono. 
  As deliberations on the political reform bills entered the 
final stages, the prime minister and his aides drew up a 
strategy to implement this "threat." While a news conference 
had also been considered, the Private Sector Seiji Rincho 
meeting was considered a better venue because the prime minister 
could appeal to the people directly without having to answer 
questions about how he would take responsibility for the failure 
of political reform. 
  The prime minister once used a Private Sector Seiji Rincho 
meeting effectively in November 1993, just before the House of 
Representatives passed the political reform bills. At that 
time, he gave the impression that he was much more dedicated to 
political reform than Kono, and this contributed to the passage 
of the bills in the lower house. 
  In his speech on 27 January, the prime minister emphasized 
the seriousness of the present crisis. He said that if the 
political reform bills were scrapped, "what will happen to 
Japanese politics, which would remain what it always has been, 
and the Japanese economy and the people's livelihood, which are 
suffering from a severe recession during this period of 
transition?" He rejected a plan suggested by some members of 
the LDP and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] that a 
consultative body be created under the auspices of the upper 
house president and the lower house speaker, after which the 
Diet session would be closed. 
  Hosokawa reiterated his commitment to political reform, and 
appealed for the ideological and sentimental support of the 
people, saying "political reform is a question which belongs in 
a different realm from the maneuverings and power struggles 
between political parties and factions." Some U.S. newspapers 
even expressed support for the prime minister as a reformist, 
seeing the affair as similar to the "reformists versus 
conservatives" paradigm in Russia with President Boris Yeltsin. 
The prime minister, who prides himself on being the champion of 
"responsible change," seems to be also trying to enlist 
international support. 
  At a news conference on the evening of 27 January, Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said, "While we may need 
the north wind sometimes, ultimately, the important thing is to 
reach agreement with the warmth of the sun, or mutual trust. I 
think that is the decisive factor in the success or failure (of 
political reform)." 
  Perhaps the fact that the prime minister called for a top 
meeting with Kono in a Private Sector Seiji Rincho speech showed 
his desperation to finalize everything through mutual agreement 
after pushing political reform all the way using the "numerical 
strength" of the majority. 
  "I do not know. I do not know." "In any case, right now, I 
do not know." These were the only replies he gave to questions 
from reporters after the joint council of the two Diet houses 
ended in failure in the early hours of 28 January. 
  After his speech at the Private Sector Seiji Rincho, he said 
"(What I said about not clinging to my position) was merely 
stating the obvious. This does not mean dissolution of the Diet 
or resignation as prime minister," meaning his remark did not 
signify the scrapping of the bills would immediately call his 
political responsibility into question. Nevertheless, a remark 
like this at such a delicate time in political reform process 
cannot be taken lightly. 
  A ruling party Diet member, expressing his expectation, 
predicted that "if both the prime minister and President Kono go 
to the top-level meeting prepared to resign [if they fail], 
discussions will certainly be successful."

  [Text] Satsuki Eda, United Social Democratic Party [USDP] 
head (and concurrently director general of the Science and

reorganization, probably within this month. During a party held 
in Okayama city on 16 January, Eda told reporters, "I will form 
a new party within the coalition immediately after the Diet's 
approval of the political reform bills." 
  Eda then noted that the new party will be formed by liberals 
and that the party will prepare for the next general election in 
cooperation with the conservative parties in the coalition. He 
said: "The USDP will be dissolved when I form a new party with 
grass-roots democrats in the coalition. However, the new party 
will contest the next general election in cooperation with the 
other coalition members (including the conservative parties)."

  [Text] Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura plans to 
publish a book entitled "Japan: A Small But Brilliant Nation" 
["Chisaku-Tomo Kirari-to Hikaru Kuni: Nippon"] early this week. 
Takemura, who has been noted for being at odds with Ichiro 
Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], 
over political stance and strategies, intends his new book to be 
an antithesis to Ozawa's "ordinary country" [futsu-no kuni] 
argument on which the latter elaborates in his book entitled "A 
Plan To Rebuild Japan" ["Nihon Kaizo Keikaku"]. Takemura's book 
will be a follow up to a magazine article published early this 
month in which he unfolded his "anti-Ozawa declaration." In the 
backdrop of expected political turmoil with the rejection of the 
political reform bills at the upper house plenary session, there 
have been rumors that Ozawa plans to "remove Takemura." Under 
such circumstances, Takemura's book is expected to create new 
ripples in political circles. 
  Takemura directly challenges Ozawa's assertions in the fifth 
chapter of his book where he explains his views on where Japan 
ought to be in the world. Here, Takemura does not mention 
Ozawa's name, but says: "It has been argued that to preserve 
world peace, Japan should make military contributions 
appropriate to its national strength. To state my conclusion 
first, I do not agree with this idea." He also says: "I 
believe what the world earnestly desires of Japan is its active 
participation in nonmilitary contributions." He thus challenged 
Ozawa's "futsu-no kuni" argument. 
  As concrete ways in which Japan can make nonmilitary 
contributions, Takemura proposes a "green peacekeeping 
operations" project in which young Japanese can serve to work on 
"covering the earth's continents once again with greenery." In 
so saying, he stresses Japan should strive to become an 
environment-oriented nation. 
  Meanwhile, regarding the ruling coalition government's 
internal situation, Takemura says: "Discussion is openly held 
on a major portion of the policy area." However, he adds: 
"Personal relations cannot necessarily be judged on what 
appears on the surface. It is quite possible that antagonism, 
discord, and internal strife could occur due to conflicting 
interests and emotional troubles." Thus, Takemura's book draws 
attention as it gives a gloomy forecast of Japanese politics in 
view of a further regrouping of the political parties.

<F P=106> [Masaharu Gotoda, former chief cabinet secretary, </F>
interviewed by Takakazu Matsuda, deputy chief, MAINICHI SHIMBUN 
political section; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Deliberations are being held on a political 
reform bill in the Diet, where the Liberal Democratic Party 
[LDP], once on the offensive, now finds its position totally 
reversed. What brought about the LDP's collapse after over 37 
years of one-party rule? What steps should it be considering 
next? To find out, we asked party elder and lower house member 
Masaharu Gotoda. 
  Nagata-cho Logic, Political Reporters 
  [Takakazu Matsuda] One of the things you've been saying for 
quite awhile is: "If the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] doesn't 
carry out political reform, it's going to see hell." How do you 
view the political situation today, now that there's been a 
change of administrations? 
  [Masaharu Gotoda] When I made that comment, what I meant to 
say, first of all, was that, if we didn't take another look at 
our political system and make changes while we could, the issue 
of political reform would get gridlocked in the Diet and the 
objective situation at home and abroad would have completely 
changed. Political reform is something that should be undertaken 
at the hands of the LDP as the ruling party. If we don't do it, 
I was saying, we'll see hell. By "hell," I was referring to the 
day when people would no longer have any trust in parliamentary 
politics and just throw up their hands and turn away from 
government. That kind of climate, I was saying, would be very 
dangerous for our country. 
  In another sense, I was saying that, if the present 
political 
situation continues, there will be no end to the corruption 
surrounding politics, and there would no longer be any clear 
line between money and politics. There would be a growing 
distrust of politicians and government among the people, and the 
end result, I was saying, would be the collapse of parliamentary 
democracy in this country. 
  I meant the statement as a warning, but unfortunately, the 
party's reign came to a close. I guess you can say, a new bud 
has sprouted. So we can hope, at least as far as restoring the 
image of government is concerned, that the Hosokawa 
administration can carry out its work without any undue 
confusion and disorder. 
  For me, the LDP is a very important political party. But in 
a 
real sense, the most important thing, as far as our citizens are 
concerned, is that we create the kind of environment where they 
have a definite sense that government exists in Japan. So, for 
us, the Hosokawa administration is like a partner and here, on 
this point, I would like to see it succeed. 
  [Matsuda] What was one of the reasons you thought the LDP 
would be "seeing hell"? 
  [Gotoda] First of all, there are certain background factors 
to consider. Until recently, the ideological confrontation 
between East and West was carried over and projected into the 
confrontation in this country between the ruling and opposition 
parties. That's gone now. The LDP has come this far by having 
successfully pursued policies as a member of the democratic 
camp. The age of ideologies has literally disappeared. But the 
LDP is still living in the age when there was one-party rule. It 
has become careless, thinking that things will somehow turn out 
as it wants. It still has an arrogant "do if we dare" attitude 
about itself. Also, there's the turbidity that comes with having 
maintained power for a long time. 
  The raison d'etre for political parties is usually to gain 
power and put their ideologies into action. But the opposition 
has neither that kind of ability nor vitality. But because of 
that ideological tension in the background, the opposition does 
serve a positive role for the country in restraining [the power 
of the ruling party]. When that confrontation no longer exists, 
the opposition exists without a role. 
  So, what happens between opposition and ruling parties is 
the 
kind of government where they rely on each other and work in 
collusion with each other behind the scenes. To put it in a less 
flattering way, they build up a mutual relationship while 
licking each other's wounds. People no longer understand that 
[kind of mentality]. 
  So, we get the phrase "Nagata-cho logic." According to this 
kind of logic, politicians get things done with easy-going, 
behind-the-scenes maneuvering. This is all pretty far removed 
from the average citizen. They might not have a clear 
understanding of what's going on, but somehow they sense 
something odd is happening. So, when a scandal breaks, they say, 
"What? Again!" and they end up distrusting government even more. 
  I'm sorry to say, it is the mass media that is to blame. 
It's 
the fault of those who are assigned to cover us politicians. 
Even when they know something is going on, they don't report 
what's really happening. A give-and-take relationship develops 
between the reporter who is assigned to cover the politician and 
the politician he's been assigned to. I think this works as a 
big negative for Japanese politics. Those in the mass media are 
directing some pretty harsh criticisms at the government but, 
from our perspective, they haven't really gotten the truth out. 
In the end, reporters and the politicians they're reporting on 
naturally begin to take up the same breathing pattern. 
  Prerequisites for Being Prime Minister 
  [Matsuda] What you say hits home. But to turn your argument 
around somewhat, wasn't it former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka 
who abused the assigned-reporter system the most and made it 
into what it is? 
  [Gotoda] The change of administrations this time marks the 
end of Tanaka-style politics. In other words, the quarrel over 
who was to succeed (Noboru) Takeshita was a struggle over the 
Tanaka legacy, and it threw the entire party into disarray, 
leaving us with what we have today. It was a real pain for the 
other factions. That's why (Ichiro) Ozawa (secretary general, 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]) didn't try to become party 
president. (Ryutaro) Hashimoto (chairman, LDP Policy Research 
Council) has the potential to become president. But he didn't 
even try to get nominated. It's a period for him for 
self-examination--which, I think, is good. Probably he's looking 
over the political scene, knowing he should take a term or two 
to quietly reflect on his situation. 
  [Matsuda] For a time there was a "Gotoda, [LDP] presidential 
hopeful" theory going around. 
  [Gotoda] Not as far I was concerned. When there's a change 
of 
government, like the one now, people expect big changes. They 
want someone fresh and new, not the head of some faction who's 
like merchandise that's been on the floor for a long time. I'm 
too old. Unlike before, today's prime minister is on the run all 
the time. Generally speaking, he has to be about 60 or 
thereabouts and be in good health and have lots of energy, or 
else he isn't going to do this country any good. I wouldn't have 
the stamina to keep up. 
  There's also another reason. You'll find it happening in a 
company, a government office, wherever. Usually, he's a section 
head or in that class. When he reaches 40 or so, say until he's 
in his mid-40's, there is something in the air or something 
about him that makes people think, "that guy is going to be a 
top company executive" or "someday he's going to be vice 
minister." It's the same with politicians, isn't it? After 
someone has been reelected to his fourth or fifth or sixth term, 
people are going to think, "there's a chance that guy is going 
to be prime minister someday." But, then, there's the guy, 
totally devoid of that kind of atmosphere, who tries and makes 
it. It's all really very unfortunate for the country. 
  [Matsuda] Does (Prime Minister Morihiro) Hosokawa have that 
air about him? 
  [Gotoda] Yes, he does. It's his upbringing. 
  The Hosokawa cabinet had a good start, which I thought was 
very good for the country. If you ask yourself why his 
administration has been able to get a 70-percent voter approval 
rating, it's a reaction by the voters. They were disillusioned 
with existing political parties, especially with the LDP and 
Social Democratic Party of Japan, and wanted something new. That 
feeling, I think, has something to do with the new 
administration's positive ratings and was fueled to some degree 
by the mass media. Whether the administration can maintain those 
ratings or not depends on its performance from here on out. 
  The test will probably come in three basic areas: political 
reform, emergency economic policy, and the economy's medium- and 
long-range restructuring. The degree to which the Hosokawa 
cabinet succeeds in these areas will determine its worth. If it 
succeeds, it'll find itself a niche in history. 
  [Matsuda] What, then, in the midst of all this should the 
LDP 
be doing? 
  [Gotoda] We're looking into a number of reform 
proposals--for 
example, into an age limit of 70 and the dissolution of party 
factions. Nothing startling or unexpected. 
  [Matsuda] Can you go for a system that imposes an age limit 
of 70? It will be like cutting your own throat. 
  [Gotoda] It doesn't bother me. Mandatory age limits are 
something we should have. As for our factional system, it has 
presented too many obstacles in the past. On the other hand, we 
can't have some 200-plus members of the lower house running 
around every which way. Of course, some of them are on top of 
any developments in our committees or affecting national 
politics as a whole. Some have a half-way decent understanding 
of what's happening. Others don't know what's happening. And so, 
to discuss policy matters and share information, there have to 
be meetings of various sorts--by region, for example, or with 
regard to specific policy issues, or by the number of terms one 
has served in the Diet. 
  The most important point here is that there be avenues for 
communication. All 200-odd members of the party can't be 
together all at once, so we have to have some alternative means 
to communicate. But it's best to dissolve the kind of factions 
we've had until now. Factions will have to be dissolved. It'll 
happen, like it or not, if our political contributions system is 
reformed. Practices like leaving it up to the factions to see to 
whatever funds are necessary for routine political activities or 
helping out with contributions when elections are held are 
probably going to be a thing of the past. The day for that has 
come, so there is no need to fight it. 
  Shedding Old Ways To Become a `Party of Trust' 
  [Matsuda] Would it be necessary to place age limits on the 
heads of local governments, too? 
  [Gotoda] If you look at what's happening these days, with so 
many gubernatorial and mayoral elections, you naturally begin to 
wonder whether it wouldn't be better to impose restrictions. 
That way, voters would be able to focus their attention again on 
national politics. 
  [Matsuda] In planning its comeback, does the LDP have any 
strategies with regard to national policy? 
  [Gotoda] There's the issue of the tax system. I wonder if 
voters are going to go along with the idea of simply lowering 
the income tax while raising the consumption tax. It will mean 
higher taxes for the less affluent voter who is living on a 
tight budget. Voters who have fatter wallets are the ones who 
are going to benefit from an income tax cut. In a situation like 
that, if you ask whether you can raise the consumption tax rate, 
I would say, no, probably not. Then, you're going to have to 
consider the consumption tax in regard to specific items. Some 
items--like food, for example--are necessities whether you're 
rich or poor, and you're going to have to consider how such 
items are going to be handled. 
  Or, to give another example, how much of the consumption tax 
is going to be shifted to the social security system? At what 
percentage will the ratio be held between the tax burden and the 
social security burden. Questions like this must be clarified. 
  Sitting at roundtable discussions these days, I'm always 
asked the same question: "Sensei [teacher], people 
like me are now contributing to the pension system, but when we 
retire, will we be getting the same kind of benefits that others 
are getting now?" Everyone is worried. 
  We have to give very clear answers to those kinds of 
questions and then say, "We can't do everything at once. This 
year we'll do this, next year we'll do that." We want voters to 
have an image of us of the sort where they're going to say, "The 
LDP is seriously studying the issues. It's a party we can depend 
on." 
  Then, when that happens, we'll win in the elections. There 
is 
no reason at all, I think, for the party to lose confidence. How 
much confidence does an opposition party with a collection of 50 
or 60 members have? There's no way a major party with 227 
members in the lower house alone will lose confidence. 
  [Matsuda] What do you see happening in terms of the 
political 
situation in the future? 
  [Gotoda] The realignment, or regrouping, of parties due to 
the change of administrations is just the first step, I think. 
Depending on the objective situation, there may be as many as 
two or three further regroupings. Whether that will happen 
before or after the next election or the election after that I 
can't say. But it's still my opinion that there will be more 
realignments. 
  Although I personally think it will be hard to get to the 
point where we have a two-party system, the aim of political 
reform is an electoral system--namely, a combination of 
single-seat constituencies and proportional 
representation--that, in effect, creates the kind of situation 
where there are two major opposing parties, with political power 
alternating between the two. 
  Two major political forces engage in a healthy face-off. 
Sometimes they switch off and the other party is in power. It's 
a political relationship with a certain degree of tension. And 
because of that, Japan's parliamentary government is 
invigorated. That, I think, will happen. It's what political 
reform means. Political contributions, the electoral 
system--they're means, not ends. They are a way of getting our 
foot in the door so we can create the kind of political 
situation I've just described. 
  [Matsuda] To change the subject, what is your opinion of 
(Ichiro) Ozawa? 
  [Gotoda] I'm not sure. His political skills are impressive 
and I respect him for all the effort he's seemingly putting into 
political reform. But, if I were to consider just what I've read 
in print about him, I'd think he had a dangerous leaning toward 
national hegemony. I would frankly have to admit having certain 
misgivings about him. 
  Friendly U.S.-Japan Relationship Is Fundamental 
  [Matsuda] There is a lot of talk about Komeito being an 
issue 
for the Hosokawa cabinet. 
  [Gotoda] It will be a problem unless we can get a clear 
separation between church and state. I'd hate to see the day 
when religious antagonisms are brought in to plague us 
domestically. Komeito says a separation between church and state 
exists, but that's certainly not the impression I get. 
  [Matsuda] Recently, at the general meeting of the Watanabe 
faction and elsewhere, LDP president Yohei Kono's 
pro-Constitution stance has been criticized. 
  [Gotoda] To be sure, there's that kind of criticism. But if 
we take that attitude, we'll end up being isolated outcasts in 
Asia. It's what you call being a national supremacist. What 
other Asian countries fear most is a remilitarized Japan. [They 
have] the plutonium and the technology to make nuclear bombs at 
any time. The manufacturing ability exists to make any number of 
them. So, we can't have Japan go overseas and start using its 
military power. By then, warnings will be too late. 
  The most important thing for us to consider now is 
maintaining friendly relations with the United States. We can't 
be a dependent state. When something has to be said, we 
shouldn't hold back. But at the same time, an amicable 
relationship between our two countries is basic. So, in dealing 
with Asian countries, we have to make sure we include the United 
States. Don't leave the United States out and try to go it 
alone. That's basic. 
  [Matsuda] How do you feel about Prime Minister Hosokawa's 
"war of aggression" pronouncement? 
  [Gotoda] That I can't agree with. Colonialism isn't good, 
and 
certainly an apology to Korea is called for. I would also 
acknowledge that [ours] was a war of aggression against China. 
But there's absolutely no reason at all for apologies from us 
concerning World War II. That's because it was a war waged for 
world hegemony between two super-camps--on the one hand, Japan, 
Germany, and Italy; and, on the other, England, the United 
States, and the Soviet Union. The only difference between us is 
that we lost. There's no need to apologize later. 
  But, in the process, Japan occupied other Asian countries. 
That wasn't good. But you also had Indonesia under Dutch rule, 
the Philippines under U.S. rule, and Singapore under British 
rule. So, when the time came, Japan felt compelled to do what it 
did. But that's speaking like a disinterested third party. In 
the end, I guess you could say our actions were inexcusable.

<F P=106> [Article by Hiroto Kosuge, MAINICHI </F>
SHIMBUN political reporter: "Mass Media Versus Political World"] 
  [Text] The fact that Ichiro Ozawa shifted from his 
closed-door "informal press conferences" to open "formal press 
conferences" poses a question concerning political reporting and 
politicians' statements. 
<H3>  Ozawa Has Obscured His Actions to the Degree That He Has 
Distanced Himself From Reporters </H3>
  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro 
Ozawa played a leading role in the formation of the coalition 
government and will play a key role in the full-scale 
reorganization of the political world based on the new election 
system. It need not be said that Mr. Ozawa's future actions will 
be of foremost concern to political reporters. However, the 
atmosphere prevailing around Mr. Ozawa is completely in contrast 
to that normally seen in connection with a political leader. If 
one were to ask, do reporters swarm around in the presence of 
Mr. Ozawa? the answer would be, "No," and no reporters are to be 
seen in the mornings or evenings around the Ozawa residence in 
Fukazawa, Setagaya ward. 
  Leaders of the past who aspired to become prime minister and 
were gaining momentum towards that goal were in all cases 
exposed to the mass media offensive. Even Mr. Ozawa had been 
exposed to such an environment not long ago. Such leaders 
normally studied how to deal with political reporters, plotted 
to guide public opinion to their advantage and attempted to 
confirm public reaction by influencing reporters into writing 
about their views. Since such guidance often included major news 
items, political reporters have found it quite difficult to 
prepare articles without subjecting themselves to such 
manipulation. In recent years, typical leaders who used the 
method were former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka and former LDP 
Vice President Shin Kanemaru, but Mr. Ozawa has not continued 
the mass media approach of the Tanaka faction and the Keiseikai 
and has assumed methods which refute such an approach. 
  The following four points cover the media policy launched by 
Mr. Ozawa after the recent House of Representatives' election: 
1) Will not respond to early-morning and late-night 
news-gathering; 2) Will not hold informal press conferences; 3) 
However, in compensation, will respond to any questions during 
formal press conferences; and 4) When a reporter wants a 
personal interview, he will be asked to specify his purpose and 
make a prior appointment. 
  In summary, he made a declaration that he would make himself 
available to the mass media in a "formal" way. Three months have 
passed since this Ozawa policy was implemented, but comments 
concerning it vary widely. His policy emphasizing "formal" press 
conferences has been welcomed as being proper in recent times 
when adhesion between politicians and political reporters has 
been criticized, but, on the other hand, some sources criticize 
the fact that Mr. Ozawa's routine actions are more difficult to 
discern to the degree that the policy distances him from 
reporters. The policy poses the serious issue of political 
reporting and politicians' statements, beyond what was 
envisioned by Mr. Ozawa. 
  The site is waiting room No. 25 assigned to Shinseito in the 
Diet building. The time is during the Ozawa press conference 
immediately following the early-in-the-week coalition government 
summit meeting and the air is filled with tension. The 
conference can be attended by anyone not belonging to the press 
club such as weekly magazine reporters and special foreign 
reporters, and no restrictions are imposed on questions. The 
conference on 12 October lasted for 40 minutes. 
  Reporter: The Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ] is taking a lot of time to debate proposed revisions to 
the Self-Defense Forces Law. Are you in a position to agree with 
the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] revision plan? 
  Ozawa: I am in agreement with the substance of the 
proposed revision plan. However, although this statement applies 
to the LDP as well, the issues of peace and security have not 
necessarily been adequately debated within the coalition 
parties. (omission) Even the LDP cannot be proud of the fact 
that it has not done an adequate job in this respect. I am not 
about to agree to an LDP proposal just because the coalition 
parties have not completed their debate on the issue. 
  Reporter: A Communist Party Diet member posed a 
question in the Diet about Mr. Ozawa exercising control over 
general contractors in Iwate Prefecture, but... 
  Ozawa: I have received donations from all kinds of 
people and would have to assume that general contractors were 
among them. I know there is a Tosho Club, but it is not an 
individual support group. Neither I nor my office has ever heard 
any rumors about the dam construction project. 
  Reporter: The Korean daily press quotes Mr. Ozawa 
as saying that parliamentary dissolution and general elections 
will take place after autumn next year and formation of a new 
party will take place as soon as the outlook for those actions 
becomes clear. 
  Ozawa: Since there are appropriate cut-off points 
to accomplish certain actions, it is only appropriate to assume 
that party reorganization will take place in connection with 
changes in election systems, and differences in 
intergenerational perceptions do exist within the LDP as well as 
within the coalition parties. (omission) We must admit to the 
existence of such intergroup differences in concepts. This is 
why we can expect reorganizations in both ruling and opposition 
parties. 
  Otherwise, questions posed covered a broad range such as the 
liberalization of rice imports, consumer tax rates, and Russian 
President Yeltsin's visit to Japan. At the end of the press 
conference, he was asked, "It has been some time since you 
discontinued informal press conferences, how do you feel about 
that topic now?" Mr. Ozawa responded by saying, "I find nothing 
wrong with that approach. I do not comment on things I cannot 
discuss with the press, but do comment on topics when it is 
permissible. I feel discontinuance of the informal press 
conferences was not a bad idea." Later, increased attention was 
focused on Ozawa press conferences to include the one held on 
the 16th in Shizuoka city when he clarified his position of not 
objecting to tariffication of rice imports. 
  Individuals posing questions during press conferences are 
required to first state their company and personal names and if 
they should inadvertently forget to do so, Mr. Ozawa will not 
respond. Whenever a question is not clearly stated, Mr. Ozawa 
makes a naked display of his displeasure. At times, he even 
reminds the attendees, "Please research your questions 
thoroughly before you come to the conference." Foreign 
correspondents also attend the conferences and at one session 
when a British Broadcasting Corporation reporter asked, "May I 
pose a question in English?" Mr. Ozawa rejected the request, 
saying, "No. This is the Japanese Diet." At any rate, Mr. 
Ozawa's attitude of never smiling and refraining from use of 
flattery towards the press contributes to the creation of a 
"pervasively contentious" atmosphere between him and the press. 
There was the view that Mr. Ozawa himself will probably come to 
the point where he himself will not be able to tolerate the 
exclusive use of the formal press conference, but Mr. Ozawa has 
clearly denied that view, saying, " I will not take any action 
to revive the informal press conference." 
  Ozawa's office has stated that it will respond to requests 
for news-gathering appointments other than formal press 
conferences on a case-by-case basis. As an example, the office 
has said that it is prepared to respond to requests which make 
the purpose clear in such terms as "We wish to conduct an 
interview on international contributions," or "We have heard of 
a certain scandal and we would like to confirm the facts." It is 
a case where the office will not respond to requests for 
late-evening or early-morning news-gathering sessions where the 
purpose is unclear, but will respond, to the extent feasible, to 
any requests for U.S.-style news-gathering sessions based on 
appointments. 
<H5>  Unusual Scenes Enacted During Informal Press Conference Days </H5>
  Political news-gathering can be subdivided into four major 
categories: formal press conferences, walk-along 
question-and-answer sessions, informal press conferences, and 
exclusive news-gathering sessions. All reporters aim for 
exclusive reporting which uncovers special tidbits, but in the 
case of influential leaders, time restrictions and 
news-gathering onslaughts often require informal press 
conferences where the leader is confronted by questions, and 
replies are recorded by several reporters. There is this 
news-gathering technique where reporters hold walk-along 
question-and-answer sessions as they walk next to the 
influential leader. Even if in-depth questioning is impossible, 
simple "Yes" and "No" responses provide the basis for valuable 
information sought by the reporter. 
  In the past, numerous reporters once covered Mr. Ozawa in 
this manner, but now even if reporters ask a question of him, he 
responds, "If I were to reply now, it would not have the value 
of a statement made at a press conference." Such brusque 
treatment has led to the situation where reporters tend to shy 
away from him. 
  Late-night or early-morning news-gathering sessions in which 
politicians are periodically visited at their homes is a 
technique peculiar to Japan. There are some politicians who 
loathe that approach and some who will speak frankly only in 
their home environment. Previously, Mr. Ozawa responded to 
early-morning news-gathering sessions at his home in Fukazawa. 
  Special criticism has been addressed to the abuses of 
informal press conferences. The contents of such conferences 
have normally been treated on an off-the-record basis and are 
quoted with such anonymous references as "sources," "senior 
officials," "leader" and "official." Politicians dislike making 
commitments and tend to use ambiguous statements in reference to 
sensitive issues at formal press conferences and make frank 
statements at informal press conferences where direct 
attribution is not made in subsequently published articles. 
Chief cabinet secretaries over the years have held informal 
press conferences after formal sessions, leading to the 
possibility of strange articles which refer to statements made 
by the same chief cabinet secretary as if they came from two 
different individuals, such as, "The chief cabinet secretary 
made a statement during the press conference which revealed 
".....," which was later interpreted by a government official as 
"...." 
  On the other hand, there have been times when statements 
made 
during an informal press conference become an issue and the 
question is posed at a formal press conference held by a senior 
government official asking, "Was the statement made this morning 
by a government source true?" In reality, the senior government 
official and government source are the same individual and 
frequently that same individual acts out an unusual role, saying 
"That statement by the government source was in error." 
  Informal press conferences are attended by reporters 
assigned 
to cover a specific individual and basically tend to cause the 
concerned politician to be relaxed and prone to speak frankly, 
significantly more so than when conducting a formal press 
conference attended by an unspecified large number of reporters. 
Moreover, because informal press conferences are composed of 
reporters belonging to an inner circle, there is little chance 
that off-the-record pledges will be violated, and if a pledge is 
broken and an article of attribution is published, an off-limit 
order is issued and the reporter loses temporary access to the 
politician. Even in those cases where politicians do not detect 
violations of the off-the-record rule, fellow reporters 
occasionally "inform" the politician of such violations. The 
practice is such that it can be called a mutual reporters' 
"surveillance system" and a system which enables politicians to 
cause reporters to write only those articles which are 
advantageous to the former. 
  Nevertheless, the content of informal press conferences is 
often published in weekly magazines. In July, a segment of an 
informal press conference was published in a weekly magazine, 
which sharply angered Mr. Ozawa and became one reason for 
discontinuing informal press conferences. It is also true that 
Mr. Ozawa took measures such as off-limit actions in the past 
and that for reporters, he was a very difficult politician to 
cover for news-gathering purposes. 
  Former LDP Vice President Kanemaru made maximum use of 
informal press conferences as a way of manipulating the 
political situation and flow of information on policy decisions 
without clarifying the source of the information. If such 
information was released anonymously, he would be able to escape 
any responsibility. Put another way, he released information 
anonymously, because he did not wish to shoulder responsibility. 
Further, politicians deliberately make statements at informal 
press conferences knowing that they will be conveyed to rival 
politicians. In effect, that comprises a situation in which 
reporters play the role of intelligence brokers. Even though 
reporters sensed the risks inherent in the informal press 
conference format, it was impossible for them to totally 
disregard the words of influential leaders, and they had no 
choice but to recognize that informal press conferences were a 
rich source of information on the frank sentiments of 
politicians. 
  The high appraisal given to Mr. Ozawa's discontinuance of 
informal press conferences represents one side of the coin, the 
reverse of which reflects criticism of information released at 
irresponsible "backstage" sessions. The strong view persists 
that formal press conferences cover news in principle and that 
informal press conferences and exclusive news-gathering sessions 
reveal the true sentiments, and such views have led to the 
situation in which the formal press conference format for 
political reporting has been compromised. Politicians who do not 
manifest differences in what they say between formal press 
conferences and informal press conferences are referred to as 
"uninteresting politicians," "politicians who lack strategy," 
and "politicians in name only" and typical among them is Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata who is compared with Mr. Ozawa in this 
respect. House of Representatives Speaker Takako Doi of the 
SDPJ, currently in the process of seceding from the party, is 
regarded as an uninteresting politician despite her popularity 
with the general public. 
  Again, the reason is that she is a politician lacking in 
inside stories. Politicians such as LDP lower house member 
Junichiro Koizumi state, "I have nothing to say off-the-record," 
even when you meet him personally and repeatedly makes bold 
statements, but Mr. Koizumi is a very exceptional politician. 
  In summary, placing more significance on "unofficial" than 
"official" utterances in the political world can be seen in 
relationships between politicians and the mass media, 
diminishing the significance of statements made by politicians 
in the public arena. We must admit that the mass media added 
credence to such an atmosphere. Appreciation for the Ozawa 
format rests on the hope that it will accelerate restoration of 
credence to the "official" version in politics. 
<H3>  Why Were Reporters Unable To Uncover Personnel Decisions 
Made Behind Closed Doors? </H3>
  However, there has been criticism of the Ozawa format. I 
believe the political reporters' foremost function is to report 
on the actual process leading to policy and personnel decisions 
influencing national government affairs. In other words, I am 
speaking of reporting on the so-called actions and thought 
processes of politicians and bureaucrats. That is, "Who met 
whom, where, and what was said." 
  This issue concerning news-gathering is currently being 
widely debated in the form of criticism over political 
reporting, but it nonetheless pertains to work which is of 
foremost importance to a political reporter. These particular 
points do not become obvious in the process of conducting formal 
press conferences. Such reporters must function as vigilant 
"observers" closely associated with politicians. We are not 
speaking of writing articles to curry the favor of politicians 
for the purpose of seeking information or "adhesion" emanating 
from avoidance of articles which cover relations between various 
personalities. We are speaking of a situation which has no 
connection with criticism of ties between political reporters 
and politicians which is being widely covered at the present 
time. 
  After the House of Representatives election of 18 July, Mr. 
Ozawa disappeared from the public arena as soon as he declared 
the discontinuation of late-night and early-morning 
news-gathering sessions. Everyone had expected that Tsutomu Hata 
would be the candidate for prime minister, but then the prime 
minister candidate was shifted to Japan New party President 
Morihiro Hosokawa, which was obviously a personnel action taken 
by Ozawa. Reportedly, this personnel decision was made at an 
undesignated place in Tokyo on 22 July in a discussion between 
Ozawa and Hosokawa. 
  It was very difficult for political reporters to uncover the 
complete details on this closed-door personnel decision. Because 
of Hosokawa's popularity, public criticism did not arise during 
the decisionmaking process of this designation, but it was 
considerably more difficult to discern in comparison to previous 
LDP presidential elections and I believe it would not be 
unreasonable to hear criticisms which label the actions as 
closed-door politics. 
  Prime Minister Hosokawa was designated as such on 6 August 
and he initiated work on organizing a cabinet, but in the 
process of news coverage concerning appointments to the cabinet, 
appointees which were not revealed to the very end were those 
from Shinseito. Appointment of Mr. Fujii as minister of finance 
was one that most of the mass media was unable to anticipate. 
  Why was that the case? The answer lies in the fact that Mr. 
Ozawa would not release information to his close associates and 
the inability to track Mr. Ozawa's actions. Needless to say, 
such information would not necessarily have been available 
through informal press conferences or late-night and 
early-morning news-gathering sessions, and Mr. Ozawa himself 
said, "I cannot under any circumstances discuss personnel 
matters with any one." 
  However, it is indispensable for the mass media to maintain 
surveillance over politicians no matter how much the latter may 
dislike the practice, and it is only logical for the mass media 
to criticize the approach in which that function is abandoned 
from the outset in sole compliance with the wishes of Mr. Ozawa. 
Even if as a minimum commentators and scholars may comment on 
the Hosokawa government, the current approach precludes the 
fulfillment of the political reporters' role to report on the 
authoritarian drama involving the shift from Hata to Hosokawa. 
  A midlevel Diet member of the LDP's Obuchi faction provides 
a 
very level-headed appraisal of the Ozawa format, saying, "Having 
freed himself from coverage by closely associated reporters, I 
imagine he finds it easy to engage in behind-the-scenes 
politics. The only purpose of the formal press conference is to 
cover the official version of news." 
  Mr. Ozawa has said, "Political articles should deemphasize 
factional or personality disputes and provide more complete 
coverage of policies. Reporters should avoid late-night and 
early-morning news-gathering sessions and devote more time to 
research." However, although this is a very appropriate 
statement addressing press coverage which places excessive 
coverage of political situations, it is alsao extremely 
self-serving. 
  The prime minister is truly the foremost politician who must 
make available information on his actions for reporting by prime 
ministerial reporters who stalk him day and night. Needless to 
say, if the prime minister wishes to make confidential 
movements, there are a number of ways he can accomplish that, 
but the mass media has established a system called prime 
ministerial reporting to keep the public informed of his 
movements. 
  Setting aside discussions on whether it is functioning 
properly, the system pertains to the resourcefulness of the mass 
media. It is inadvisable to create a myth about Ozawa, but I 
believe Mr. Ozawa compares with the prime minister based on the 
interest exercised in him in political circles. Even many 
aspects of former influential leaders like Yoshida, Hatoyama, 
and Kishi were invisible and the public tolerated that fact, but 
in this information age, we must refrain from tolerating 
politicians of that type and Ozawa should not be treated as an 
exception. 
<H3>  How Will Reporters Assigned To Cover the Political Situation 
Perform News-Gathering Tasks? </H3>
  As indicated in the preceding text, reactions to the Ozawa 
format are complex. It may be that the upheaval in the political 
world has imposed a situation where the political mass media 
stands at a crossroads. No reporters believe that their job is 
complete once they finish a formal press conference with Ozawa. 
Although it is a task of utmost difficulty, they use a variety 
of techniques to approach and gather information on Mr. Ozawa. 
In that respect, the very fact that late-night and early-morning 
news-gathering sessions and informal news conferences are no 
longer held has caused reporters to intensify their 
news-gathering efforts. 
  However, a positive appraisal of Mr. Ozawa's format might 
generate the expectation that it will inspire a movement for 
restoring political "statements" to matters of genuine political 
concern. LDP House of Representative member Koichi Kato 
comments, "Even for politicians, formal press conferences 
without informal follow-on press conferences would be a big 
relief. However, we will have to be articulate during the formal 
press conferences and that will require us to be well-versed in 
potential topics of discussion. I believe the future will demand 
that type of politician." 
  Leadership exercised by the LDP in the past was embodied in 
"political power" or in other words "rights and interests." The 
LDP was not a political party that emphasized ideology like the 
SDPJ or Communist Party. LDP Diet members were required to 
coordinate matters concerning rights and interests, rather than 
matters concerning theory, and politicians who spoke of theories 
were shunned. 
  Now that the LDP has lost political power, it must take the 
initiative in stating its goals and concepts. It can no longer 
survive under past concepts where it devoted itself to 
coordination of rights and interests, now that it is no longer 
in control of the government. Now that all aspects such as 
diplomacy, defense, agriculture, and economic policies must be 
reviewed, politicians must express their views publicly to 
provide a sense of direction to the general public. They must 
also use logic to rebut any criticism. This trend will probably 
be accelerated by the existence of television which tends to 
influence political reporting. At any rate, television reporting 
is very realistic in terms of the audio and visual display 
transmitted to the public. 
  Further, Mr. Ozawa's assertion that we should discontinue 
diet interpellations handled by bureaucrats and convert to 
interpellations in which ministers and parliamentary vice 
ministers play a central role should be considered in the 
context of the preceding statement. 
  I believe the Ozawa format has become controversial because 
it was launched by Mr. Ozawa who is a powerful politician who 
previously played a central role in connection with Takeshita 
and Kanemaru politics. If the format had been launched by some 
other politician, the mass media would not have given it much 
attention. I believe the reason why Mr. Ozawa assumed the format 
was that he felt that the political turmoil required 
increasingly difficult behind-the-scenes coordination, that he 
would have no time to cope with the mass media and he wished to 
"avoid" the situation where he would be pursued by the press. 
When it comes to people like Mr. Ozawa, reporters will gather at 
their press conferences and television will organize special 
programs. 
  I believe he embraced a realistic attitude that he should 
express himself freely whenever such an occasion presented 
itself. 
  However, aside from Mr. Ozawa's motivations in launching the 
format, it is a fact that it presented the political mass media 
with the question of just what is political reporting and 
political news-gathering?

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "General Contractors Produce </F>
Corruption: Prefectural Assemblies' Overall Shift to Government 
Party; Supervisory Function Declines; Also Fear of Checking 
`Decentralization'"] 
  [Text] Following after the governor of Ibaraki Prefecture, 
the governor of Miyagi Prefecture has also been arrested on 
suspicion of receiving bribes from general contractors. Beside 
the criticism of whether there was not, in the manner of placing 
orders for public works, a foundation which spawned corruption, 
these scandals involving public works ordered by prefectures are 
also inviting observations as to whether the oversight function 
of prefectural assemblies was functioning in a healthy manner. 
It can be said that the basis of local government is being 
shaken because the so-called "phenomenon of a shift to the 
government party" of prefectural assemblies has become a 
nationwide trend, and the number of governors who are retired 
officials from central government agencies has risen. If things 
go on like this, the "decentralization of power" which the 
Hosokawa government espouses can also fade. 
  Governor Shuntaro Honma of Miyagi Prefecture, who was 
arrested on suspicion of having accepted bribes, aided by such 
things as Recruit-scandal distrust and helped also by the 
defeat-by-default of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], was 
elected in March 1989 with the endorsement and support of the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], the United Social 
Democratic Party [USDP], and some conservative members of the 
prefectural assembly. But four years later, in February 1993, 
the parties supporting him had increased to four: the LDP, SDPJ, 
Komeito, and the Japan Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and he 
defeated by a great margin a candidate endorsed by the Japan 
Communist Party [JCP]. 
  This kind of phenomenon is seen in every region throughout 
Japan, and as will be clear from the table, even though there 
are differences in the combinations, in general, it has become 
normal for all parties other than the JCP to share in the 
relationships of endorsement and support of the current 
governors of urban and rural prefectures.

  In the case also of former governor Fujio Takeuchi of 
Ibaraki 
Prefecture, in the gubernatorial election of 1991 he received 
the endorsement and support of three parties--the LDP, Komeito, 
and DSP--and of the Ibaraki Rengo, so, including the SDPJ, which 
voted independently, it was, in fact, a sharing by four parties. 
  In the gubernatorial election on 26 September to choose his 
successor, four conservative parties: the LDP, Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party], Japan New Party, and new Sakigake [Harbinger] 
party, cooperated, transcending the government-opposition party 
framework, and elected a former Home Affairs Ministry division 
chief. But the former mayor of Mito City, who did not receive 
party support, was catching up with him, and the turnout dropped 
below 40 percent, so criticism of the central political parties 
by the people of the prefecture stood out sharply. 
  Why does "a shift to the government party" advance apart 
from voter consciousness? Professor Hitoshi Abe (political 
science) of the University of the Air says, "Every party gains a 
great benefit by a shift to the government party because the 
volume and speed of information related to prefectural 
government is incomparably greater than that of opposition 
parties, and its "influence" regarding administration is also 
effective." But, on the other hand, he points out that an 
assembly's supervisory function toward prefectural government 
certainly declines. 
  Following the arrest of Governor Honma, a certain governor 
in 
eastern Japan said, "One can point out two problems in the 
arrest of two governors. One is the individual problem of the 
evil or flaw in ethical view of being elected many times. The 
other is the fact that governors are leaders who can act 
promptly in response to situations. In addition to being chosen 
by direct election, they have exclusive control of such things 
as the authority to compile budgets and to manage personnel. 
Concentration of authority leads to a trap." 
  At a press conference on 28 September, Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who has served as governor of 
Shiga Prefecture, also pointed out the dangerous nature of the 
corruption that lies dormant in the "position of governor," 
saying, "If one lowers one's guard for a moment, one will be led 
astray. It is a battle with one's own heart." 
  Of current urban and provincial governors, 27 have a 
background in central government agencies or in 
government-related agencies. Although one cannot condemn them 
wholesale, one expects there are many cases in which 
"connections with the central government" were used as selling 
points when running for election. It is surmised that, to that 
extent, it was expected by constituents that the governors would 
have skill in such things as attracting large national projects. 
  Concerning the influence that general contractor corruption 
exerts on "decentralization," a Ministry of Home Affairs 
executive says, "The view is spreading that corruption would 
advance even further if we delegated power from the central 
government to the provinces." It seems that the scandal this 
time involves substantive questioning of local autonomy and the 
proper nature thereof.

<F P=106> [Article by YOMIURI SHIMBUN investigation team: "Twenty-Two </F>
Urban and Rural Prefectures Do Amakudari Introductions; 
`Intimate Arrangement' of Local Government and Construction 
Industry; Allotment and Selection of Persons for Jobs"] 
  [Text] On 7 October it was learned through an investigation 
by the YOMIURI SHIMBUN Company that 22 urban and nonurban 
prefectures throughout Japan, and three government-regulation 
designated cities are using their good offices to enable 
officials who are scheduled to retire to find employment in the 
construction industry and are transmitting to industry members 
information on officials who are scheduled to retire. At least 
seven urban and nonurban prefectures among these 25 autonomous 
bodies have established "amakudari [the practice of retiring 
officials assuming good positions in the industries with which 
their agency deals] systems" in which reemployment committees, 
construction-related departments, and so on become interface 
points to handle such business as selecting former officials 
and allotting them to each company. In response to it being 
pointed out that amakudari has become a hotbed of 
"government-industry adhesion," in August [1993] the Ministry of 
Construction set forth the policy that it would independently 
refrain for the time being from amakudari of executive-level 
officials, but in local government, only Okayama Prefecture gave 
up amakudari recommendations. And only two prefectures, Chiba 
and Tottori, indicated that they would "reconsider." 
  Local governments that are using their good offices and 
introducing retiring personnel are of two types: 1) ones in 
which the autonomous body allots and selects personnel if there 
is a request from contractors for their former officials to 
take a position upon retirement--Iwate, Miyagi, Tokyo, Shiga, 
Wakayama, Yamaguchi, and Ehime; and 2) ones which, if there is a 
request, ask the retiree's own wishes and make an 
introduction--Hokkaido, Aomori, Chiba, Kanagaws, Niigata, 
Shizuoka, Mie, Osaka, Hyogo, Tottori, Kagawa, Kumamoto, 
Nagasaki, Oita, and Miyazaki Prefectures and the cities of 
Sapporo, Chiba, and Nagoya. 
  Typical of the first type is Miyagi Prefecture, whose former 
governor, Shuntaro Homna, was arrested. The usual practice is 
for such industry members as general contractors to submit to 
the prefecture documents called the "application for transfer of 
talented staff" and "employment application," and for the 
Construction General Affairs Section, for example, to allocate 
reemployment positions by checking the inclinations of the 
retiree with those of the company. 
  In Yamaguchi Prefecture an employment committee headed by 
the 
lieutenant governor studies reemployment positions for those 
scheduled to retire based on "transfer applications" from 
construction companies. Finding reemployment via one's own 
connections is called "self-development," but such cases are 20 
to 30 percent. The majority are said to find new positions in 
the private sector through the good offices of the prefecture. 
In Tokyo, each bureau coordinates through its own connections, 
and at the Bureau of Construction the bureau's executives become 
the point of interface, receiving requests from companies and 
introducing staff to prospective new employers. There are also 
many cases in which the contractor-side designates the person 
desired; in Aichi Prefecture contractors were making inquiries 
to the persons in charge of the Civil Engineering Division and 
Construction Division regarding such things as prospective 
employees' efficiency reports and state of health. 
  The Ministry of Construction not only independently 
refrained 
from amakudari for its own officials at the division-chief and 
office-chief levels, and at the department-chief and above level 
in local construction bureaus, but also made a practice of 
obtaining from general officials a written promise that they 
"will not engage in the operation of public works construction." 
But on the local government side there is a strong view that, 
"in order to make the most of officials' experience and 
technology after their retirement, one ought not establish 
limits to the places in which they can be reemployed. Firms in 
which former officials find employment do not have an advantage 
in bidding and so on." 
  In regard to using good offices and making introductions, 
standing out are such opinions as "We are different from places 
like Sendai and have no special problem, so there is no need to 
change" (Yukio Yamauchi, chief of Niigato Prefecture's Civil 
Engineering Department), and "Civil Engineering Department 
former officials who have found positions in the private sector 
are generally in charge of operations, but the objective of 
operations is to receive designation [as an approved bidder], it 
does not go beyond that" (Tetsuo Enamiya, chief of Kochi 
Prefecture's Civil Engineering Department). 
  For Okayama Prefecture, which has a positive attitude toward 
independent restraint, it had become a usual practice for two to 
five of the 10 or so persons who retire annually from the Civil 
Engineering Department to find new employment by receiving 
recommendations from the department chief, but beginning in the 
current fiscal year the prefecture stopped serving as a 
connection.

  [Text] On 18 January the Ministry of Finance [MOF] decided 
to provide approximately 8.99 trillion yen [Y] for public works 
projects in fiscal 1994, up 5 percent from the previous year. 
The growth rate of the entire budget will remain relatively low 
since serious revenue shortages are certain for fiscal 1994, but 
public works expenditures will be increased to boost the economy. 
  The total amount of public works expenditures for fiscal 
1994 
will be calculated as the sum of general public works 
expenditures, disaster-relief funds, and Y1.23 trillion in 
interest-free loans from funds raised by the profits from 
selling stocks of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation 
(NTT). Among the government agency budget requests submitted on 
31 August 1993, public works plans for fiscal 1994 totaled 
Y8.939 trillion. 
  In consideration of the current economic situation, the MOF 
intends to approve almost all budget requests from government 
agencies. In addition, the public works budget will include 
funds for constructing nonpublic subways, which is usually 
classified as "miscellaneous projects." 
  To reinforce subway networks, the Ministry of Transportation 
is asking for Y58.5 billion for urban railway projects, and Y2.6 
billion for the new-town railway project of the Housing and 
Urban Development Corporation. The MOF intends to allot about 
Y60 billion for these projects, with the amount of the publics 
work budget totaling Y8.99 trillion. 
  The 5-percent growth of the public works budget is the 
largest since fiscal 1988 (up 19.7 percent), when NTT stock 
loans were introduced to the initial budget.

Morning Edition] 
  [Text] The government's Tax System Research Council (an 
advisory body for the prime minister, chaired by Kan Kato) 
decided on 19 January to postpone a 24 January general meeting 
to discuss specific ways to decrease the income and resident 
taxes and raise the consumption tax. The general meeting will 
be held after 25 January. The council decided to put off 
full-fledged discussion of the tax issue out of consideration 
for parliamentary deliberations on the political reform bills 
which are at a crucial stage.

  [Text] The government has firmed up the outline of a new 
package of stimulus measures in an attempt to pull Japan out of 
the prolonged recession. In the new package of stimulus 
measures, the government plans to add approximately 2.9 trillion 
yen for general public works projects and other public works 
projects to be implemented by the Japan Highway Public 
Corporation, while asking local governments to increase budgets 
for their own public works projects. The Finance Ministry and 
the Construction Ministry have entered the final stages of 
coordinating a plan to increase the number of houses eligible 
for loans from the Housing Loan Corporation to about 60,000. A 
set of financial measures to help small- and medium-sized 
enterprises will be incorporated in the new pump-priming package 
and the size of public investments and loans will amount to 
nearly 9 trillion yen. The new pump-priming package, if income 
tax and residential taxes are cut drastically, will be the 
largest ever, far exceeding the 1993 April pump-priming package 
of 13.2 trillion yen. The government intends to put Japan's 
economy on track toward recovery with the new package of 
stimulus measures, and to raise the real growth rate by 2 
percent in 1994. 
  With the package of political reform bills rejected in the 
House of Councillors, it remains uncertain when the government 
will compile the new pump-priming package, and there is a 
possibility the government will formally decide on the new 
package in February. The government plans to submit the third 
supplementary budget bill to the Diet when its ordinary session 
is convened after deciding on the new pump-priming package, but 
the government's plan will be affected largely by the political 
situation which is reeling from disputes over political reform. 
  The pillar of the new package of stimulus measures is the 
addition of public investments. In public works projects to be 
implemented by the central government and public corporations, a 
substantial amount of the budget will be allocated for 
life-style-related projects aimed at upgrading current sewage 
systems and other things in line with the Hosokawa government's 
policy of improving the "quality of life" for the people. In 
the new package of stimulus measures, 600-700 billion yen will 
be additionally allocated as the so-called facility budget for 
research and development institutes in universities and welfare 
and medical facilities, but there is a possibility the budget 
will be further increased. The government will issue 
construction bonds to secure necessary financial resources. 
  The government, that is now studying ways to set aside about 
200-300 billion yen in the package for public works projects and 
the project of upgrading sewage systems to be implemented by 
local governments, plans to ask local governments to submit 
their respective supplementary budgets to their assemblies in 
March this year. 
  A plan is being coordinated within the government to 
allocate 
approximately 600 billion yen to the central government and the 
Housing and Urban Development Corporation, and 1.5 trillion yen 
to local governments to help them buy land for public works 
projects. Approximately 500 billion yen will be allocated to 
private urban development organizations to help them buy land. 
  The number of houses eligible for loans from the Housing 
Loan 
Corporation will be increased to about 60,000, and the amount of 
the loan will be raised to 1 trillion yen. 1.3 trillion yen 
will be set aside for loans by the Small Business Finance 
Corporation and other government-invested finance corporations 
to small- and medium-sized businesses. The new package of 
stimulus measures will include approximately 11 billion yen as 
subsidies for job-creating projects. The package will also 
incorporate deregulation, steps to expand Japan's imports, and 
the flexible management of monetary policy. 
  In the package, the government will include tax incentives 
to 
spur stalled land transactions and provide financial help to 
small- and medium-sized enterprises, but the focal point of 
contention is income tax reduction. A proposal is presently 
surfacing for cutting both income tax and residential tax by 6-7 
trillion yen. In a bid to secure necessary financial resources, 
the Finance Ministry is asking that income tax and consumption 
tax be respectively cut and raised. Coordination will be 
completed after the political reform bills are settled. 
  The third supplementary budget is supposed to ensure the 
continuity of government-financed projects from 1993 to 1994 in 
light of the present situation where the government has to rely 
on a provisional budget because of a delay in the parliamentary 
deliberations for the budget bill for fiscal 1994. The 
government intends to back up the economy with this budgetary 
arrangement and put the Japanese economy on-track with annual 
three-percent growth in the latter half of 1994 when cuts in 
income tax begin to spur the economy.

<F P=106> [Article by Yoshio Suzuki, researcher in BOJ Information </F>
Service Department, and deputy director, Executive Office, 
Central Committee on Savings Public Relations: "Household 
Economy Becomes Cautious, Reflects Sluggish Economy--Results of 
1993 `Public Opinion Survey on Savings and Consumption'"] 
  [Text] The Central Committee on Savings Public 
Relations (executive office is Bank of Japan [BOJ] Information 
Service Department) recently announced the results of the 1993 
"Public Opinion Survey Regarding Savings and Consumption." This 
survey has been conducted once a year (latter part of June to 
latter part of July) since 1953, targeted at regular households 
nationwide with two or more household members (6,000 households, 
return rate 68.5 percent) in order to grasp the actual state of 
savings, consumption, and life awareness. Below, we would like 
you to view the major characteristics of the results of this 
survey. 
<H5>  Average Amount of Savings Held and Composition by Category </H5>
  The average amount of savings per household for households 
with savings was 13 million yen, the highest in the past, but it 
was no more than a small increase of 3.3 percent compared to the 
previous year (12.59 million yen). Moreover, the median amount 
of savings (the amount of savings of households positioned in 
the middle when ranking households with savings in order of the 
amount of savings held) was 7.32 million yen, a slight increase 
of 1.0 percent compared to the previous year. 
  In the component ratio by category for amount of savings, 
"deposit savings" was the largest, accounting for 50.2 percent, 
next in order were "insurance and annuities" (25.3 percent), 
"negotiable securities" (14.4 percent), and "loans and money 
trusts" (6.4 percent). Moreover, viewing these by annual income 
level, a special characteristic was that deposit savings 
accounted for over half in the low income level, but the 
percentage of negotiable securities was high and the percentage 
of deposit savings was low for those with annual income over 7 
million yen. 
<H5>  Reasons for Increase in Amount of Savings Held </H5>
  Viewing the reasons for the increase in savings (multiple 
answers), the percentages for "increase in earned income" (43.2 
percent) and "higher percentage of savings because of earned 
income" (34.1 percent) continue to be high, but with the recent 
economic trends, while the percentage of households indicating 
"increase in earned income" has continued to decline for three 
years, households indicating "a higher savings percentage" have 
greatly increased (27.8 percent previous year to 34.1 percent) 
and the condition of stressing savings even amidst the leveling 
off of income stands out in relief. 
  On the other hand, a few households indicated "dividend and 
interest income" (11.1 percent), "extra income from inheritance, 
retirement pay, etc." (5.8 percent), and "increase appraised 
value of stocks" (2.0 percent), etc. 
<H5>  Selection Criteria for Savings Categories </H5>
  The percentage was greatest for households indicating 
"security" (43.5 percent) as the most important criteria in 
selection of savings category and next in order were "fluidity" 
(27.1 percent) and "earnings" (25.2 percent). 
  Comparing this with past surveys, up until 1991, the 
households indicating "security" had dropped back because of the 
progress of financial deregulation and the surge in interest 
preference awareness, and household indicating "earnings" had 
increased; however, since 1992, a complete change has been noted 
with "security" increasing (most recent bottom 37.0 percent in 
1991) and "earnings" declining (most recent peak 29.1 percent in 
1991). 
<H5>  Savings Objective </H5>
  Regarding savings objective (multiple answers of not more 
than three items), the households that consider "preparation for 
illness or disaster" continues to be the greatest with 70.9 
percent, followed next by "funds for old age" (50.1 percent), 
"children's educational expenses" (35.8 percent), "no particular 
objective, but peace of mind when saving" (23.5 percent), and 
"home acquisition or enlargement/remodeling funds" (19.1 
percent), and this order has not changed since 1987. 
  Viewing this by the age of the head of household, 1) 
"preparation for illness or disaster" has the greatest weight 
for all levels, but the trends can be surmised that 2) 
"children's educational expenses," "home acquisition or 
enlargement/remodeling funds," "funds to purchase durable 
consumer goods," and "funds for travel and leisure" have 
comparatively great weight in young households, and 3) "funds 
for old age" is high for elderly households. 
<H5>  Reasons for Selection of Financial Institution </H5>
  Regarding the reasons for selection of the financial 
institution (multiple answers of not more than three items), 
households oriented toward geographic convenience continue to be 
great with "because there is a branch or ATM in the neighborhood 
and it is convenient" (73.4 percent) being overwhelmingly the 
greatest, and in addition, not a few households indicating 
"because the branch network extends nationwide" (28.5 percent). 
  Amidst this, a special characteristic of this survey is that 
"because the management is healthy and reliable" at 37.0 percent 
surpassed the previous year (28.4 percent) by 8.6 percentage 
points. 
  In addition, "because salesman was enthusiastic and image is 
good" (11.5 percent) and "because they sell commodities with 
high earnings" (9.5 percent) follow. 
<H5>  Demands for Improvement in Service by Financial Institutions </H5>
  Looking at demands for improved service by financial 
institutions (multiple answers), demands for expanded business 
hours are the strongest, with "extension of weekday window 
closing time" (44.8 percent) and "expansion of ATM functions on 
Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, and extension of operating 
hours" (42.0 percent), etc. They are followed by "rate service 
for deposit and loan interest rather than spending on the cost 
of gifts such as tissue paper" (35.1 percent) and "shorter 
waiting time at window" (34.6 percent). 
  Recently, there have been quite a few demands seeking a 
close 
relationship with financial institutions such as "providing 
information closely linked to lifestyle" (19.6 percent), 
"establishing window where you can easily have consultation" 
(19.2 percent), and "expanding communication with customers, 
which has been neglected with automation" (15.0 percent). 
<H5>  Thoughts About Financial Deregulation </H5>
  Looking at the thinking in regards to financial deregulation 
(multiple answers of not more than two items), there has been a 
gradual increase in those who appreciate the merits or 
significance of deregulation such as "choice of financial assets 
is broad and advantages are great" (19.0 percent) and "approve 
since fair markets have been formed" (15.2 percent). 
  Although households complaining of lack of information have 
decreased compared to last year (52.8 percent) such as "the 
deregulation process and details on commodities are unclear" 
(43.9 percent), besides being rather large as before, many 
indicate "apprehension about the increase in mergers and 
failures of financial institutions" (24.9 percent) and "risk 
increases because there are limits to an individual's 
information-gathering capability and there are no advantages" 
(24.8 percent). 
<H5>  About Consumption Expenditures </H5>
<H5>  1. Consumption Expenditure Trends </H5>
  Viewing the increase or decrease of consumption expenditures 
for the past one-year period, while the percentage of households 
that consider that "consumption has increased compared to the 
previous year" (44.3 percent) has dropped compared to last year 
(45.9 percent), households that consider that "it has decreased 
compared to the previous year" (13.4 percent) have increased 
from last year (10.8 percent), and the attitude toward 
consumption lately has become cautious. Moreover, regarding the 
next year, households that will continue a cautious attitude 
about consumption spending at about the same level as up to now 
have increased. 
<H5>  2. Consumption Expenditure Decreased Expense Items </H5>
  Looking at the specific expense items where consumption was 
checked along with the aforementioned changes in consumption 
trends (multiple answers with no more than three expense items), 
in the past one-year period, many households decreased spending 
on items such as clothing (64.5 percent), cultural education and 
entertainment or social (50.5 percent), durable consumer goods 
purchases (43.5 percent), or food (36.2 percent). Moreover, in 
the next year period, they plan to decrease expense items about 
the same. 
  With regard to clothing expenses, durable consumer goods, 
and 
cultural education and entertainment or social expenses among 
these items, they are already possessed to a certain extent and 
it is believed that they are being held in check because of 
their weak essential character, but it is inferred that they are 
being held in check because they can be held in check. 
<H5>  About Life Planning </H5>
<H5>  1. Status of Establishing Life Planning </H5>
  Regarding life planning, 42.7 percent of the households 
considered that "they are establishing life planning," and, 
together with households that say that "they will establish life 
planning in the future" (34.5 percent), they amount to slightly 
less than 80 percent, and it can be said that the perception of 
the importance of life planning continues to be strong. 
  Incidentally, on this point, the Central Committee on 
Savings 
Public Relations conducts without charge "computerized diagnotic 
life planning" in order to help people who are trying to 
establish life planning, and users have reached 8,000 to 9,000 
per year, with a trend of further increase. 
  On the other hand, regarding items that households which are 
establishing life planning considered important when 
establishing it (multiple answers of no more than two items), 
the greatest were households which consider "funds for old age" 
(50.8 percent), followed next by "a life that is distinguished 
by planning" (31.6 percent), "children's educational funds" 
(31.2 percent), "home acquisition or enlargement/remodeling 
funds" (22.8 percent), and "funds for children's marriage" (13.4 
percent). 
<H3>  2. Connection Between Life Planning and Household Account 
Entries </H3>
  Regarding the important household account entries with 
establishment of life planning as the basis, households which 
"enter it" (25.8 percent) and households which "sometimes enter 
it" (19.7 percent) are 45.5 percent if combined, but no great 
change has been seen in the past few years. 
  However, looking at the connection between household account 
entries and whether or not there is life planning, households 
who "are establishing" life planning amount to about 60 percent 
of the households which "enter it" in household accounts, and it 
amounts to slightly less than 90 percent if households which 
"plan to establish one" in the future are included. As opposed 
to this, households that "are establishing" life planning are no 
more than about one-third (34.1 percent) of the households which 
"do not enter it" in household accounts, and it is no more than 
about 70 percent if households which "plan to establish one" in 
the future are included. 
<H5>  Awareness About Living Standards in Old Age </H5>
  Regarding "preparations for life in old age," in addition to 
many households indicating it as the most important item for 
life planning, it also follows "preparation for illness or 
disaster" as the objective of savings, and it can be said that 
concern about living standards in old age is very high. 
  Therefore, let's look at the awareness of "living standards 
in old age" and its background, dividing households where the 
head of the household is under 60 years of age and households 
where he is over 60. 
  A. Looking at the awareness of "living standards in old age" 
in households where the head of the household is under 60, the 
percentage of households that think that "there is not much 
concern" is no more than about a third (35.6 percent), and the 
majority of the households consider it "somewhat of a concern" 
(62.0 percent). 
  On the other hand, viewing the awareness of "living now" in 
elderly households with the head of the household over 60, 
households that consider that "living without much concern" 
amounted to over 70 percent, and it can be inferred that their 
awareness contrasts with households where the head of the 
household is under 60 years old. 
  B. Behind this awareness of living standards in old age, 
households which considered that it is "because there is an 
annuity or insurance" (61.6 percent) were the greatest in those 
that "have no concern" among households with the head of 
household under 60, followed next by "because there is 
retirement pay" (33.4 percent), and "because the price of goods 
has not gone up so much that the prospects for living are 
difficult to see" (22.2 percent). 
  On the other hand, the percentage of households which 
consider that it is "because of insufficient savings" (77.9 
percent) or "because annuities or insurance is inadequate" (59.5 
percent) was quite high in households that "have concern," and 
indicated next are "because retirement pay is not enough" (35.9 
percent) and "because a large increase the price of goods is 
possible" (25.9 percent). 
  C. Looking at the source of funds necessary for living 
(multiple answers) in households with the head of the household 
over 60, households that indicated "public pension" (66.4 
percent) and "income from employment" (53.6 percent) 
respectively accounted for over half. They were followed next by 
"individual or corporate annuity" (15.3 percent), "taking from 
savings" (11.1 percent), "real estate income" (10.6 percent), 
and "interest or dividend income" (10.3 percent). 
  Recently, comparatively few households indicate "support 
from 
children" (7.5 percent), and, moreover, as opposed to the 
percentage gradually declining since 1984 (18.7 percent), 
households that indicate "income from working" has increased 
since 1989 (from 37.3 percent at most recent bottom in 1989 to 
53.6 percent in 1993), and the independent orientation of 
elderly households can be inferred.

  [Text] The advisory panels to the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI] -- the Industrial 
Structure Council and the Small and Medium Enterprise Policy 
Making Council -- have jointly worked out revisions for the 
Large Retail Store Law. 
  While the Federation of Economic Organizations [Keidanren] 
and other business associations had been urging an abolition of 
the law, the joint panel decided not to do so. Instead the 
panel prepared a revision bill for relaxing restrictions on 
large stores. The law currently requires difficult procedures 
for opening stores larger than 500 square meters, but 
liberalizes in principle the opening of stores smaller than 
1,000 square meters. Also, the bill relaxes restrictions on 
business hours and days. 
  The joint council is expected to provide the final draft of 
the bill on 28 January, but the revision may face rough going 
due to opposition from smaller retail stores. 
  Presently MITI's Large Retail Store Council controls the 
opening of retail stores larger than 500 square meters. The 
bill still has the 500-square-meters rule, but adds a provision 
that the opening of stores smaller than 1,000 square meters 
should not be intended for governmental inspection unless local 
business communities complain. The bill also seeks deregulation 
for large retail stores by: 1) while the regulation in effect 
urges all large stores to close at 1900 hours, business hours 
will be extended to 2000 hours; and 2) the annual off-business 
days for restricted large stores will be reduced from 44 to 24.

Great Difference Between Japanese and U.S. Definitions of 
Unemployment; From Past Experience, What Comes After This Will 
Be the Real Thing in Regard to the Employment Situation"] 
  [Text] Because of differences in employment 
practices, increases in Japan's unemployment rate begin to show 
up later than in Europe and the United States. In the midst of 
a prolonged business slump, judging even from past examples, we 
will encounter the real severity in the unemployment rate after 
this. 
  With hopes that the slump would bottom out also proving 
futile, and GNP for the April-June quarter being the second 
quarter of negative growth following the July-September 1992 
quarter period, prolongation of the bubble-burst recession 
became clear. Along with that, apprehension has spread that the 
employment situation will worsen after this, so interest in the 
trend of the unemployment rate has begun to grow. 
  In the initial phase of the recession a period of 2.1 
percent 
unemployment continued for some time, but beginning about one 
year ago, the unemployment rate gradually rose and in July 
1993 has become 2.5 percent. 
  Since the unemployment rate did not increase for a long 
time, 
it seems likely that we are in a situation in which a view will 
spread that Japan's statistics on unemployment are not grasping 
the real situation. But before dismissing it as just a problem 
of statistics, we should take into account fully the actual 
situation of the labor market which lies behind the unemployment 
rate. Otherwise, it will be impossible to foresee accurately the 
development of the future employment situation that will 
accompany prolongation of the recession. 
<H5>  The Bubble Reserve </H5>
  If we follow the economic white paper for the current fiscal 
year and say that the high point of the last period of 
prosperity was the April-June quarter of 1991, the unemployment 
rate progressed at the same level of 2.1 percent for one year 
after that. It began to rise in July-September 1992, five 
quarters later. 
  In past recessionary phases, changes in the unemployment 
rate 
were such that, generally the rise in the unemployment rate has 
been slow in the first half of the recession, and the tempo of 
the rise has quickened as it approached the business trough of 
the second half. Yet, for the unemployment rate to not rise at 
all for one year, as happened this time, is a rare phenomenon 
even in past recessions. But it is not completely without 
precedent; the situation in the recession following the "Izanagi 
boom" of October 1965 to July 1970 resembled this time. 
  The way in which Japanese companies promote employment 
adjustment affects deeply the fact that the tempo of 
unemployment-rate increase quickens in the latter half of a 
recession. In the initial stage of a recession, companies mainly 
promote reductions in overtime, and as the recession advances 
further, they gradually begin to reduce employment. Here, too, 
they begin with temporary and part-time employees, and finally 
adjust regular employment when the recession has become fairly 
severe. Therefore, it means that generation of jobless persons, 
which raises the unemployment rate, is concentrated in the 
latter half of a recession. 
  The question is the reason which has particularly delayed 
the 
rise in the unemployment rate this time. It seems that the 
greatest reason is found in the labor market during the bubble 
period of prosperity. 
  In the bubble period of prosperity, the effective job offer 
ratio rose to 1.4 times that during the Izanagi boom. In a 
complete change from what had been the case up till then, 
companies were forced to go to considerable trouble to secure 
employees. Therefore, memories of that trouble probably did not 
fade easily even when they entered a slump. Furthermore, there 
are also limitations on labor supply for the medium to long 
term. It seems that this kind of situation caused them to hold 
back for some time on adjustment of employees. The high level of 
company revenue stored up in the bubble period of prosperity 
also made such holding back possible. 
  The unemployment rate turned upward from the July-September 
1992 quarter, and, although the rate of increase in the 
unemployment rate did not reach that of the recession following 
the first oil crisis, it has approached that of the latter half 
of the slump following the second oil crisist and returned to 
the ordinary rise in the unemployment rate during a slump. This 
indicates that accompanying the lengthening of the recession, a 
change has begun to occur in companies' heretofore cautious 
posture toward employment. 
<H5>  The Japanese and U.S. Definitions Are About the Same </H5>
  Next, let us turn to the question of unemployment 
statistics. 
The view that Japan's unemployment statistics do not grasp the 
situation of the labor market accurately has been repeated every 
time up till now that a slump has occurred. At its root is a 
perception, regarding the level of Japan's unemployment being 
markedly lower than that of Europe and the United States and 
the rise in the unemployment rate during recessions being too 
low, that the real situation is not so. Until now the assertion 
has often appeared that if one looked at Japan's unemployment 
rate by U.S. criteria, it would be twice what it is at present. 
  It was conventional wisdom that by nature Japan's definition 
of an unemployed person was strict, and that the unemployment 
rate had become less than in Europe and the United States for 
that reason. 
  But that was not something based on a strict comparison. 
Beginning about 1980, after the Statistics Bureau of the 
Management and Coordination Agency began to use the kind of 
research that makes it possible to change over to U.S. 
definition of an unemployed person, quantitative comparison of 
Japan's unemployment rate with those of Europe and the United 
States became possible. At about that time, based on the results 
of that research, I made a preliminary calculation of Japan's 
unemployment rate based on the U.S. definition of an unemployed 
person. As a result of that, it became clear that the 
unemployment rate was at about the same level by Japan's 
definition and by the U.S. definition. 
  The unemployed of Japan's definition are persons 1) among 
those who have not done work accompanied by income during the 
week of the survey (1 week) and are capable of working, who 2) 
actively sought employment in the week of the survey (1 week), 
or 3) actively sought employment in the past and are awaiting 
the results of that activity. 
  The U.S. unemployed are persons 1) among those who have not 
done work accompanied by income during the week of the survey (1 
week) and are capable of working, who 2) actively sought 
employment during the past four weeks including the week of the 
survey, or 3) have been laid off and are awaiting a return to 
work, or 4) have employment arranged to begin within 30 days. 
  What differs in Japan and the United States is that the 
period in which employment is sought in item 2 is short in 
Japan, at 1 week, but in the United States it is the past four 
weeks, as well as Japan's item 3 and U.S. items 3 and 4. 
Japan's item 3 and U.S. items 3 and 4 are all ones that are 
included as exceptions in the unemployed by removing the 
condition of seeking employment in 2. 
  Next, based on a February 1993 special labor force survey, I 
will make a preliminary calculation of the number of unemployed 
according to the U.S. definition. The number of unemployed at 
that point in time was 1.57 million, and the unemployment rate 
was 2.4 percent. 
  First, of those in Japan's item 3, we exclude 360,000 
persons 
who did not seek employment in the last four weeks, and next we 
add to the unemployed the non-labor force population other than 
those unemployed by the Japanese definition: 120,000 who sought 
employment in the last four weeks and 190,000 who had arranged 
for employment to begin within 30 days. In regard to U.S. item 
3, since Japan has no system of layoffs, we do not adjust it. 
The result is that the number of unemployed by the U.S. 
definition comes to 1.52 million, and the unemployment rate 
comes to 2.4 percent. 
  Thus, the difference between the Japanese definition and the 
U.S. definition is small. But if we look at it separately by 
sex, the unemployment rate for females comes out to be higher by 
the U.S. definition because it extends the period during which 
employment is sought. 
  In Europe, especially in England, France, and Germany, they 
publish unemployment rates based on the number of persons 
seeking employment who are registered at employment offices. 
Therefore, it is difficult, as it stands, to compare with such 
countries as Japan and the United States, which publish the 
unemployment rate based on sample surveys. 
  However, the EC has recently begun to conduct an annual 
survey that employs the same definition of the unemployed as the 
United States, so comparison with the EC has become easy. The 
unemployment rate in that EC survey, for 1991, comes to 7 
percent for England, 9 percent for France, and 4 percent for 
Germany, considerably higher than Japan. Furthermore, the U.S. 
unemployment rate at that time was 7 percent. 
<H5>  Cyclical Factors and Structural Factors </H5>
  It is possible to view the unemployment rate by dividing it 
into the part that fluctuates in response to poor or good 
business conditions and the part that is not influenced by 
changes in business conditions. The unemployment rate that 
fluctuates with business conditions is called the 
insufficient-demand unemployment rate, or the cyclical 
unemployment rate. On the other hand, the unemployment rate that 
is not influenced by fluctuations in business conditions is 
called the structural unemployment rate, the balanced 
unemployment rate, the full-employment unemployment rate, or the 
natural unemployment rate. 
  The way of referring to them varies because the respective 
definitions differ depending on economic theory and unemployment 
theory. The difference between the Japanese unemployment rate 
and those of Europe and the United States is found mainly in the 
part of the unemployment rate that is not influenced by 
fluctuations in business conditions. 
  The FY92 White Paper on the World Economy presented the 
results of an estimate which divided the unemployment rate of 
Europe and the United States into a cyclical unemployment rate 
and a structural unemployment rate. Therefore, applying this, we 
shall advance our discussion of the cyclical unemployment rate 
and the structural unemployment rate. 
  According to the cyclical unemployment rate, Germany is 0.7 
percent, England and France are 1.7 percent, and the United 
States is 3.8 percent; therefore, Germany is low and the United 
States is high. Japan is closer to Germany. 
  The level of the cyclical unemployment rate depends on the 
method of employment adjustment. If, as in Japan, one adopts an 
employment-adjustment method which emphasizes reduction of 
working hours, the cyclical unemployment rate is low. Germany, 
too, seems to have a system of shortening working hours, and 
it can be seen that adjustment of working hours is carried out. 
  In contrast to this, because of the diffusion of the layoff 
system, emphasis in the United States is placed on adjustment of 
employees rather than on reduction of working hours, so the 
cyclical unemployment rate seems to have become high. 
  Concerning the structural unemployment rate, the United 
States is 3.3 percent, England is 7.3 percent, France is 7.5 
percent, and Germany is 7.7 percent, so it is high in each 
country of Europe and the United States. Japan is on the level 
of 2 percent, lower than Europe and the United States. 
  The level of the structural unemployment rate depends on the 
supply and demand adjustment in the labor market. If the labor 
market's performance is good, the structural unemployment rate 
is low, as in Japan. In recent years, in the midst of 
internationalization and the advance of technological 
innovation, every nation has been exposed to structural changes 
in the demand for manpower. If the supply side's response to 
structural changes in demand is unsuccessful, the structural 
unemployment rate continues to climb. 
  However long one might wait, there is no hope for recovery 
in 
demand for types of occupation for which there has been a 
structural decline in demand. Workers in such occupations must 
acquire new occupational skills and transfer to occupations for 
which demand is increasing. If they cannot do that, the workers 
will continue to be out of work. 
  Japanese companies educate and train workers in-house and 
are 
carrying out employment management that emphasizes making the 
best use of staff within the company; therefore, in response to 
structural changes in demand, adjustment of supply and demand is 
first attempted by assignment changes within the company or the 
enterprise group. Then, when it becomes difficult by internal 
adjustment alone, it is for the first time left to adjustment of 
the market outside the company. That is, in Japan a worker's 
change of occupation is promoted in an in-house labor market, so 
generation of the structurally unemployed is restrained there. 
  In contrast to this, in Europe and the United States an 
in-house labor market is not functioning as it is in Japan, so 
the response to structural changes depends directly on 
adjustment of supply and demand in the external labor market. 
That apparently invites increases in the structurally 
unemployed. 
  Of course, all sorts of factors have influenced the 
difference in the structural unemployment rate between Japan 
and Europe and the United States, but it is thought that, among 
them, the difference of using an in-house labor market accounts 
for considerable weight. 
  Even in Japan, the rigorous employment adjustment of 
dismissals and inviting voluntary retirement was carried out 
after the first oil crisis. Therefore, from the 1970's into the 
1980's, the unemployment rate at the peak time of business 
conditions rose, and the structural employment rate became 
higher, albeit slightly, than that of Europe and the United 
States. 
<H5>  It Is Necessary From a Long-Term Perspective, But... </H5>
  The current recession is about to become as long as the one 
after the second oil crisis, which, at three years, was the 
longest in recent years. In past recessions, the unemployment 
rate remained high even after business conditions had passed 
their low point and turned to an expansionary phase, taking 
some time before the unemployment rate fell. Furthermore, after 
the first oil crisis, the unemployment rate continued to rise 
even in an expansionary phase. This is because, although 
generation of new unemployment declined along with the recovery 
of business, the unemployed who did not find new positions 
remained unemployed for some time even after the low point in 
business conditions passed. From such experiences in the past, 
we feel that the unemployment problem would become more severe 
in the future. 
  Moreover, in the current recession, the production index for 
manufacturing industries is recently showing its greatest 
decline, if one excludes the slump following the first oil 
crisis, which was the greatest since World War II. 
Notwithstanding that in the initial phase of the recession, 
companies refrained from adjustment of employed personnel, the 
bill for that would come due after this. 
  With the strong yen and the cold summer, companies are 
revising downward by a wide margin their estimates of future 
demand, and are intensifying measures toward employment 
adjustment. Lately, newspapers almost every day carry articles 
about companies implementing employment adjustment and 
suspending for the next fiscal year the hiring of new graduates. 
  Just a little while ago, managers were howling about the 
difficulty of securing workers. Those managers are now 
struggling to adjust employment. What a bewildering change. 
  Even if they can weather the current crisis by implementing 
employment adjustment, in terms of the future, it will for the 
most part come out to be a loss in the aspect of securing 
manpower. Accompanying the advent of an aging society, the Japan 
of the future is about to become a society in which the size of 
the working population will continue to decline. Do not managers 
need a viewpoint that is fixed on that kind of future? 
  At present it is important to prevent greater deterioration 
of the unemployment situation. In order to do that, it is 
necessary that business conditions recover as soon as 
possible, and company managers have a bright outlook. 
  Japan's unemployment rate is low and is not sensitive to 
business conditions. But as we have seen so far, important 
information for grasping movements in the employment situation 
is contained in the fluctuations of the unemployment rate. It 
seems that making use of this in judging the employment 
situation is precisely what is important.

  [Text] Tokyo -- At a regular news conference on 14 January 
Akira Takeshita, deputy director-general of the Defense 
Facilities Administration Agency [DFAA], commented on a report 
that the Maritime Self Defense Force's [MSDF] Staff Office is 
considering changing the construction site of a P3C transmitting 
station on Okinawa from Toyohara District in Motobu-cho to Ie 
Island in the face of strong protests from Motobu residents. 
Takeshita said: "The agency in charge of the construction has 
not been informed of any change." He also denied the report, 
saying his inquiry with the Maritime Staff Office has confirmed 
"such is not the case." 
  Meanwhile, it is also true that the DFAA has not much time 
left to execute the budget for the construction of the P3C 
communications facility. Furthermore, since the government 
formulation of the fiscal 1994 budget has been delayed this 
year, and the work on formulating the portion of the budget 
concerning the P3C project will begin in about a month, no doubt 
the DFAA faces a major problem in regards to the construction 
project which is making no headway.

<F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 20 January 94 Morning </F>
Edition] 
  [Text] The Federation of Electric Power Companies 
(president: Kohei Abe, president of Chubu Electric Power), 
organized by nine power companies, held a meeting of presidents 
from its nine member power companies on 19 January to decide on 
and announce plans for development of the No. 1 demonstration 
reactor of the fast breeder reactor (FBR), which has drawn 
attention as a key nuclear-fuel-recycling facility for the reuse 
of spent nuclear fuel. The No. 1 demonstration reactor is 
capable of generating about 660,000 kw and the cost of building 
the reactor is estimated at approximately 400 billion yen, 1.5 
times the cost of building a light water rector with the same 
capability. The building of the No. 1 demonstration reactor 
will start somewhere between 2000 and 2005. The reactor will go 
into actual operation in 2030, after construction of the No. 2 
demonstration reactor starts. 
  As for the choice of a site for the reactor, President Abe 
said: "At the present stage, our federation is studying it and 
our federation will make a close study of potential cites." In 
a bid to miniaturize the reactor and cut building costs, the 
federation will adopt a "modified top entry loop-type reactor" 
with short piping and simple structure for the first time in the 
world. At first, Japanese electric power companies studied the 
possibility of building a reactor that could burn only plutonium 
to draw down Japan's plutonium stockpile out of consideration 
for the international opinion against nuclear proliferation. 
In the end, however, the federation has decided to adopt a 
demonstration reactor model that uses "blanket fuel" to breed 
plutonium. In response, the government Atomic Energy Commission 
plans to revise the current long-term plans for development and 
utilization of atomic power.

<F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 11 January Evening Edition] </F>
  [Text] On 11 January the Ministry of Post and 
Telecommunications [MPT] began preparations for establishing 
broadcasting stations which will provide programs only in 
foreign languages. MPT's Broadcasting Bureau Chief Masaaki 
Egawa said: "Tokyo is the only major city in the world which has 
no radio station providing foreign language programs." In light 
of this, the MPT will create conditions for approving the 
establishment of new broadcasting stations to live up to the 
name of the international city "Tokyo." If technical issues 
such as allocation of electric waves are solved, it is likely 
the establishment of foreign language FM stations will be 
authorized within the year. 
  In concrete terms, FM stations will be newly established to 
provide programs only in English. Although it is planned that 
such stations will be newly established in three major cities -- 
Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya -- it is expected an FM station will be 
established only in Tokyo at first. The MPT will first study 
technical issues as to whether there will be electric waves 
which could be allocated for a new station. Then it will begin 
to work out a basic broadcasting program to improve system 
conditions. 
  What is behind the issue of setting up broadcasting stations 
for foreign language programs is that with the progress of 
internationalization, the number of foreigners who visit or live 
in Japan are increasing every year. Statistics show 980,000 
foreigners stayed in Japan for more than 90 days in 1989. In 
1993 the number increased to 1,370,000. The number of 
foreigners who visited Japan sharply increased to 3.53 million 
people (in 1991) from 2.15 million (in 1987). In light of this, 
those associated with the broadcasting business have expressed 
hope that broadcasting stations intended for foreigners will be 
established. Moreover, some felt that broadcasting in foreign 
languages is necessary in view of emergency cases such as 
disasters.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, January 21 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- At 
present Mongolia maintains trade relationships with some 47 
world's countries. The country's leading trading partner 
remains Russia on share of which falls some 48 per cent of the 
total foreign trade turnover of Mongolia. 
  After Russia there are the People's Republic of China 24 per 
cent, Kazahstan 7.5 per cent Japan 4.9 and the USA 2.9 per cent 
respectively. In 1993 year Mongolia realized foreign trade 
turnover of 722 million USD [U.S. dollars] worth, 160.9 million 
out of which constitute export and some 161.5 million import. 
[figures as received] Over 37 per cent of foreign trade for 
the last year account for the private sector's enterprises. 
This implies that their share in the foreign trade contacts of 
the country has been doubled in comparison with that for the 
year of 1992.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, January 25 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
outcome of checking the activities of the general board on 
ensuring the state security and the central police department by 
the working group of the parliament. The representatives of the 
opposition group in the parliament noted that the chairman and 
deputy chairman and the prime minister as well have expressed 
their request to check the above mentioned accusations of their 
so called abusing the official powers. They refused to give any 
commentaries on this point pleading the necessity to adhere to 
the parliamentary ethics. The capital city newspaper 
"ULAANBAATAR" published an article by scholar S. Ichinnorov on 
the creation of the present Mongolian capital. The article says 
that the city was founded as far back as 1639 and had been 
transferred from time to time until its stationing on its 
present site. Those movings of the capital historian is 
explaining in connection with the traditions of the people and 
necessity of nature protection. 
  Besides this he considers that among the other reasons there 
were aggressions of the neighbouring western tribes and the 
needs for maintaining commercial and economic relations. 
  Journalist O. Lhagvadorj in his article in the newspaper 
doubts whether the granting of the building of a club having 
been named after Lenin on lease to Russian citizen S. P. Kokarev 
was legitimate. The above mentioned citizen in his turn began 
letting lease of the building to various organizations which was 
recognized by the chief of the Consular Department of the 
Russian Embassy to Mongolia as being a violation of the decree 
of the Mongolian Government, the newspaper informs.

<F P=106> [Ian Simpson article: "Vietnam's Communists Fear Their </F>
Success"] 
  [Text] Vietnam government officials and Communist party 
cadres are gathered in Hanoi to assess the progress of their 
market reforms, which are rapidly transforming the economy. 
  Since they were first hesitatingly introduced in 1986, the 
reforms have made remarkable progress -- perhaps too much, in 
the eyes of party leaders who are worried that they are losing 
control of the economy and losing touch with the population. 
  There is no suggestion that Vietnam's economic 
transformation 
will be halted but senior party officials are worried about the 
social consequences of the reforms they have introduced. 
  Rising unemployment and a widening gap between the mostly 
urban rich and the rural poor are causing social tensions which 
some party cadres fear could surface in an imitation of recent 
peasant unrest in China. 
  Vietnam is now one of only five countries ruled by a 
Communist party and party leaders are acutely conscious of the 
fate of their former allies in eastern Europe and the ex-Soviet 
Union, much of which they blame on the reforms introduced by 
President Mikhail Gorbachev and his supporters. 
  This is the first time the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) 
has held a national conference mid-way through the five-year 
cycle between congresses. 
  In Vietnam, as in the country's huge northern neighbour, 
China, the party is trying to reform the economy while resisting 
calls for any change to the political structure. The party is 
still the only legal one in Vietnam and its leaders have no 
plans to relinquish its power. 
  Now they are increasingly worried that they are losing touch 
with ordinary people in the country, especially with young 
people who have diminishing loyalty to the ageing 
revolutionaries who still run the country. 
  "We should carry out properly the task of broadening the 
party's membership, especially among the youth and women," 
general secretary Do Muoi told the conference. "We should 
rejuvenate the party ranks." 
  Mr Do Muoi and his colleagues have reason to worry. Young 
people in Hanoi are becoming increasingly rebellious and appear 
to be more interested in western music and culture, than party 
politics. 
  Last year, some 50,000 people joined the party, which now 
has 
a membership of almost 3 million out of a population of 71 
million. However, many people say they joined the party because 
they had to or simply to boost their job prospects, rather than 
for any deep ideological commitment. 
  Party leaders, many of whom are in their sixties or 
seventies, are widely seen as out of touch with ordinary people 
who have to adapt rapidly to their changing lives. 
  On the streets of the capital, few people are even aware 
that 
the national conference is taking place and even those who do 
know show little interest. 
  To mark the occasion, Party buildings and main roads through 
the Vietnamese capital are festooned with red and gold banners 
proclaiming "Long Live the Glorious Communist Party of Vietnam!" 
and "Our President Ho Chi Minh Lives With Us Forever!" 
  One woman selling piles of oranges and apples by the 
roadside 
commented: "Oh yes, they always have banners for something. I 
don't know what these are for, though." She and the other 
traders nearby, several of whom had recently lost their jobs at 
state-run factories, said they had more pressing concerns such 
as making enough money to feed their families. 
  Elsewhere, a young woman was sitting in front of a newly 
bought television, apparently not paying much attention to a 
report on the evening news about the party conference. "They 
just talk and talk and talk," she said, "but they don't do 
anything." 
  This may sound just like the routine grumblings of people in 
many countries about their politicians. What makes these 
comments so remarkable in Vietnam is that just two or three 
years ago almost nobody would have dared to say these things, 
certainly not to a passing foreigner. 
  The report to the national conference by the party central 
committee makes repeated calls for political stability and 
stresses the need for vigilance against "all plots and acts of 
the enemy", "the scheme and acts of `peaceful evolution' by 
hostile forces" and "the way of life consisting in running after 
money". 
  However, outside the party's inner halls, people from all 
levels of society want to run after money; they are being 
encouraged by the government to start small businesses and to 
make profits. Throughout Hanoi, and across Vietnam, people are 
heeding this call. Tens of thousands of cafes, shops and other 
small enterprises have opened in the past few years. 
  In other ways, many young people have also become alienated 
from the party. They gather in cafes to listen to western rock 
music and race their motorcycles around the streets of the 
capital late at night. 
  To these people, who are searching for new influences and 
ways to escape the controls of the party, Mr Do Muoi's warning 
against "the tendency towards `commercialisation', propagation 
of heterogeneous cultures and depraved way of life" is faintly 
ludicrous.
