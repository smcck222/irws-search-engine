<F P=106> [By Yindi Loetcharoenchok] </F>
  [Text] Fighting resumed in Karenni state last week shortly 
after the Burmese junta and its armed ethnic Karenni opposition 
failed to reach agreement during peace talks. 
  A Karenni spokesman who requested anonymity said four 
battalions of the Burmese Army -- the 421th, 250th, 261st light 
infantry battalions, and 102nd ordinary battalion -- launched a 
lightning attack against about 100 Karenni fighters around 
midnight on 26 January near Danai Khong San village, which is 
about 10 miles north of Loikaw, the capital of the Karenni state. 
  Four Burmese troops were killed and three others wounded; 
the 
Karenni lost arms and ammunition during the one-night assault, 
but suffered no casualties, he said. 
  The spokesman expected the ruling State Law and Order 
Restoration Council (Slorc) would continue its offensive and 
said fighting could last until the onset of the wet season in 
April or May. 
  He said the attack on the Karenni took place 10 days after 
the second round of bilateral talks failed to make any progress. 
  Karenni and Slorc representatives met on 12 and 16 January 
about 40 miles from Loikaw. Deputy Army Chief Major Aung Mya 
led the three-member Karenni team, which also included Karenni 
officials Paulu and Shan Reh, to meet the four-person Burmese 
delegation led by Colonel Kyaw Win, deputy director of the 
Directorate of Defense Services Intelligence (DDSI), and 
Lieutenant Colonel Kyaw Thein, a DDSI officer in charge of peace 
negotiations and drugs suppression. 
  The Karenni spokesman said Slorc rejected their four-point 
proposal, while the Karenni could not accept Rangoon's demand 
that they drop political claims for independence. The Karenni 
proposal calls for Slorc to withdraw its troops from the eastern 
side of the Salween River, allowing Karenni forces to move 
freely in Karenni State, an end to collecting taxes and 
conscripting civilians as porters, and to stop using Karenni 
territory as a base to attack other armed ethnic forces. 
  Despite the breakdown of the talks, the Slorc delegation 
told 
the meeting that they would meet again in the future, according 
to the Karenni spokesman. No date had been fixed.

<F P=106> [From the "Letters" Section] </F>
  [Text] SIR: In the evening session of the Burmese program 
on January 17 1994, the BBC mistakenly announced that ABSDF [All 
Burma Students Democratic Front] student leader, Moe Thee Zun, 
and 11 others had been detained by the KNU [Karen National 
Union). On account that there had been some confusion among the 
members of the NCUB (National Council of the Union of Burma), 
and a misunderstanding upon the KNU by the people and the 
international community [as published]. Accordingly, we, the 
meeting of the NCUB members present in Manerplaw, issue a 
statement as follows: 
  The fact is that the BBC announcement came at a time when 
discussions were being held between the ABSDF led by Moe Thee 
Zun and the KNU, in order to prevent, in advance, any 
misunderstanding from occurring between the two, in connection 
with the KNU's decision to hold talks individually with the 
Slorc [State Law and Order Restoration Council], occasioned by 
various circumstances. 
  The (11-1-94) Central Committee Emergency Meeting of the DAB 
[Democratic Alliance of Burma], which is a member of the NCUB 
[National Council of the Union of Burma], adopted by consensus a 
position expressing understanding for the NMSP (New Mon State 
Party) which had to hold talks individually with the Slorc 
because of circumstances and the KNU which intended to hold 
talks individually with the Slorc. The KNU accepts with 
understanding the implementation of their own program by its 
allies, the political organisations including the Student Army, 
though it had to decide, because of circumstances, to find 
solutions to political problems through negotiations. 
  There is no serious problems between the KNU and the Student 
Army or any other ally. 
  Consequently, we have to declare that the news reported by 
BBC correspondent Larry Jagan and broadcast by the BBC in its 
evening session on January 17, 1994 is incorrect. 
  [Signed] National Council of the Union of Burma

  [Text] Malaysia and Australia will investigate whether 
opposition leaders in the country have received bribes from the 
Australian Secret Intelligence Service, ASIS, as reported by an 
Australian newspaper. Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad 
Badawi said if the report by THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH is true, it is 
a serious matter and it shows foreign interference in Malaysia's 
affairs. He said the matter was among several issues he 
discussed with Australian High Commissioner to Malaysia John 
Dauth when the latter called on him at the ministry yesterday. 
He added that Malaysia and Australia will try to verify the 
report. So far it is only a press report. 
  Speaking to newsmen in Kuala Lumpur, Datuk Abdullah also 
stressed that his meeting with Dauth was fixed some time ago and 
had nothing to do with the report. According to the report, 
ASIS agents had paid thousands of Australian dollars to certain 
senior political leaders in Malaysia and Singapore since they 
became members of parliament. Government leaders and DAP 
[Democratic Action Party] leaders have strongly criticized the 
report and called on Canberra to name those involved if the 
allegations were indeed true.

  [Text] Kuching, Jan 29 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- The Australian 
Government should verify the Australian Secret Intelligence 
Servcce (ASIS) claims that it bribed some Malaysian opposition 
politicians. 
  Information Minister Mohamed Rahmat said Saturday such a 
clarification was in the interest of good relations between the 
two countries. 
  Speaking to reporters here, he said the claims were very 
serious for if they were true then Australia had interfered in 
Malaysia's political affairs. 
  This is not in order and should be corrected.....We are not 
interfering in Australian politics as it is the right of 
Australians, our politics is our right and others cannot 
interfere, he said. 
  If it had really happened then Malaysia could not just keep 
quiet and Australia should inform the Malaysian Government as to 
who were the recepients -- were they individuals or political 
parties, he said. 
  He said it was not correct for opposition parties in 
Malaysia 
to look for funds outside of the country to finance their 
political activities. 
  In the interest of good relations between the two countries 
and to erase any doubt on the issue, the Government of Australia 
should state its stand on it, he said. 
  He said he did not think it was necessary to set up a 
commission of inquiry to investigate the matter. 
  Those involved should be frank and admit it, as it was a 
question of honour and dignity, Mohamed Rahmat said.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jan 31 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia and 
Indonesia have agreed to study whatever fresh evidence is 
available in their bid to resolve the overlapping claims on the 
Sipadan and Ligitan Islands, Malaysian Foreign Ministry 
Secretary-General Ahmad Kamil Jaafar said Monday. 
  He said both countries were agreed that the issue of 
overlapping claims on the Islands off Sabah and northeast 
Kalimantan could be settled through negotiations. 
  Whatever new documents and ideas can be presented for study 
before the third round of talks in Jakarta in May, he told 
reporters after the presentation of Japanese Government cultural 
aid to Malaysia at the Foreign Ministry here. 
  He was confident that the two sides could reach a concrete 
consensus at the talks although the issue was complicated. 
  Malaysia and Indonesia had studied all the documents and 
maps 
that were presented at the second round of talks here last week, 
he said. 
  He said both sides shared the view that all international 
legal aspects be resorted to if necessary to resolve the issue. 
  Both parties were confident that the issue would not spark 
off something that is to be regretted in the future.

  [Text] The latest news on the political crisis affecting 
the [PBS] Sabah United Party is that as many as 42 PBS branches 
have been dissolved because they have opposed the party leaders' 
decision to nominate (Koh Tong) to run in Bengkoka in next 
month's state elections. The dissolved branches have more than 
1,000 PBS members who have accused him of failing to develop the 
constituency. The dissolution of the branches was confirmed by 
(Bonong Mulung), a PBS official in Bengkoka. Members of the 
dissolved branches were disappointed with PBS leaders who had 
refused to listen to their views. 
  Meanwhile, (Tayu Memayu), a PBS member of parliament who 
decided to quit the party said his main reason for quitting was 
that the PBS would not be able to lead the state and promote a 
multiracial society in Sabah. He said PBS leaders have always 
given priority to one ethnic group only, adding that this would 
worsen the state's racist policy. People now believe that if 
PBS is returned to power, the hope for an economic recovery in 
Sabah will be dashed.

<F P=106> [By Han Fook Kwang in Bangalore] </F>
  [Text] Bangalore (India) -- Singapore's largest project in 
India -- a 58-acre (23.4-ha) Information Technology Park was 
launched by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong here yesterday. 
  He unveiled a plaque at the construction site for the S$250 
million one-stop industrial estate which has drawn interest from 
information technology industry giants like IBM and AT&amp;T. 
  Noting the speed with which the park has moved from idea to 
reality, he said it was testimony to the vision of India's 
leaders in opening up the economy. 
  "If India's reforms stay on course, I am sure that Indian 
companies which are already household names in the domestic 
market will soon be well known abroad," Mr. Goh said. 
  The Bangalore Information Technology Park, which will offer 
factory, office and residential space, is expected to be ready 
by the end of next year. It aims to meet the needs of high-tech 
companies in the computer, electronics and telecommunications 
industries. 
  There was an air of expectancy and optimism at yesterday's 
ceremony as speaker after speaker praised the speed with which 
the project has progressed. 
  Singapore's Economic Development Board chairman Philip Yeo, 
who was involved in the initial discussions on the project, said 
that if the record time -- six months from conception to ground 
breaking -- was an indication of things to come, he was 
confident of the park's future. 
  Mr. Ratan N. Tata, chairman of the Tata group, one of the 
park's joint-venture partners with a 40 per cent stake described 
it as a small step towards India joining the action that was now 
taking place in the booming economies of east Asia. 
  Bangalore is the capital of Karnataka state, which has a 20 
per cent stake in the project. Chief Minister M. Veerappa Moily 
of Karnataka state made a pledge to the park's investors, 
promising to speed up the pace at which permits and licences are 
processed. 
  The idea for the park was conceived by Prime Minister Goh 
and 
his Indian counterpart Mr. P. V. Narasimha Rao when they met in 
Jakarta in 1992. In his speech yesterday Mr. Goh said the 
decision to have the park here was based on Bangalore's good 
reputation with foreign investors. 
  However, before the expected influx of investors took place, 
Bangalore would have to restructure itself and develop its 
supporting infrastructure, he said. Singapore companies, he 
added, would be able to work with local partners here to bring 
this about. 
  If all went well, the park could become a forerunner of 
future industrial estates, and form a nucleus for the 
development of satellite townships around the city, said Mr. Goh 
who is on a week- long visit to India. 
  After the ceremony, Mr. Liew Mun Leong, group managing 
director of L&amp;M Group Investments -- a member of the 
Singapore 
consortium which has the remaining 40 per cent stake in the 
project -- told reporters that Bangalore was an eminently 
suitable site. It had many computer companies and professionals. 
  "Rather than bring them back to the US or Singapore it's 
better to operate here -- it's cheaper," he noted. 
  Dubbed the Silicon Valley of India, Bangalore is home to 
many 
household names like Texas Instruments, Motorola, 
Hewlett-Packard and IBM. 
  And with what is estimated to be a third of the 9,000 
information technology professionals in India living or working 
here, the city has been a driving force behind the country's 
growing software industry. The Information Technology Park will 
add to its attraction, and to Singapore's profile here.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Symptoms of the India Fever"] </F>
  [Text] Amidst the deafening roars of a Roman triumph, the 
official who held the wreath over the hero's head kept up a 
murmured refrain: "Remember you are only human." In the same 
way, it is as well not to forget that New Delhi's Republic Day 
pageantry is an annual affair. There is a guest of honour every 
year, and not all guests leave a significant imprint once the 
dust of the ceremony has settled. If Prime Minister Goh Chok 
Tong's presence lent a new dimension to Wednesday's 
celebrations, it was because the honour bestowed on him 
symbolises India's own changing economic perceptions. Now 
nearing its end, Mr. Goh's visit to India is meaningful because 
it is part of an integrated package and not just another 
diplomatic ritual. 
  The timing is revealing. A Singapore Prime Minister's visit 
would not have had the same impact even two years ago. Not only 
does India appear to be psychologically prepared to make the 
most of what Singapore has to offer, but many of the 
institutional changes needed to take advantage of the connection 
are already in place. However, the success that clearly marks 
the tour may prompt two questions. First, why was this rapport 
so long delayed? Secondly, will it result in a permanent 
qualitative and quantitative change so that Singapore leads 
ASEAN and the world in helping India to open up? 
  The usual short answer to the first question is that 
economics was hostage to politics all these years. This 
simplification may not be untrue, but it is not the whole truth. 
The confluence of stars (to borrow Mr. Goh's phrase) demands 
certain objective conditions that were not present earlier. It 
has taken time and effort to develop the large industrial base, 
a huge pool of scientists and engineers, and a 
200-million-strong middle class that have made India attractive 
to investors. Similarly, Singapore has built up gradually the 
reserves that are now available for investment, and taken the 
strategic decision to sprout a second wing. What is just as 
important is the fact that these are complementary attributes in 
a potentially strategic situation. 
  The agreements signed during the last few days would seem to 
bear this out. Seldom does an official visit produce so much in 
so short a time. But this is only a beginning. Important 
though they are, the agreements alone will not generate wealth. 
They will only help to create the right conditions for 
resourceful Singaporeans and Indians to give a boost to trade or 
set up joint ventures. The information-sharing arrangement 
between the Trade Development Board and six Indian organisations 
is a case in point. It will be exactly as rewarding as the use 
to which the information is put is productive. 
  Ultimately, the relationship will be what the private 
sectors 
in the two countries make of it. Singapore brings special 
expertise to the partnership. Not just capital or access to 
technology, but an international outlook, and well-honed skills 
in labour relations, property development and banking. 
Singapore's unique achievement in attracting twice as many 
tourists as there are citizens should be of interest to a 
country that has some of the world's most spectacular natural 
sights and human artefacts, but not the infrastructure for 
enough visitors to enjoy them. 
  India might also find it worthwhile to decentralise 
authority 
further so that project clearance is not held up, and to open up 
new areas, such as real estate, to foreign investment. Reforms 
in both fields would have a tremendous impact on domestic 
enterprise as well, and help to eradicate corruption rooted in 
too many complex restrictions. New Delhi might tackle some of 
these issues in next month's budget. Meanwhile, both countries 
would benefit from a better flow of information. India is not 
"Little India" writ large. Neither is Singapore only the 
shopping in Orchard Road. The sooner these tired stereotypes 
dissolve, the better it will be for pragmatic interaction.

  [Text] Singapore and Pakistan have agreed to further 
liberalize their air services agreement, the Civil Aviation 
Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said on 27 January. Effective 
immediately, the revised agreement allows each country's 
designated airline to operate four-weekly services using any 
aircraft type between the two countries. Now Singapore Airlines, 
SIA, operates one weekly Boeing B747 and two weekly Airbus A310 
services to Karachi, with a total weekly seat capacity of 767 
seats. 
  For its part, Pakistan International Airlines operates three 
weekly A310 services to Singapore, providing a total weekly 
capacity of 204 seats. 
  Both airlines plan to increase their services this year, 
CAAS 
said.

  [Text] The Republic of Singapore Navy is to acquire 12 new 
patrol craft to replace 12 coastal patrol craft that have served 
the Navy since 1980's. The second minister for defense, Dr. Lee 
Boon Yang, said the new patrol craft will be equiped with 
state-of-the-art command, control, and communications system. 
They will further enhance the Navy's fighting and civil defense 
capabilities. 
  Dr. Lee said for the first time in Singapore Navy's 
shipbuilding program, all the phases of design, construction, 
and system integration are carried out locally. The patrol 
vessels will be designed and built by the Singapore Shipbuilding 
and Engineering, a subsidiary of Singapore Technology. Dr. Lee 
was speaking at the launch of the Navy's second mine 
counter-measure vessel, RSS [Republic of Singapore Ship] (Kalau) 
at the Singapore Shipbuilding and Engineering yard at Tuas. The 
vessel is one of the four mine counter-measure vessels Singapore 
has ordered from Sweden.

  [Text] According to various informed sources, Prince 
Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh travelled to Singapore on 27 
January. Observers have made different comments on the prince's 
trip. They are as follows: 
  Some say Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh went to 
Singapore 
for a medical checkup because his overwork had caused him 
dizziness and hypertension. But others believe that the 
prince's medical treatment in Singapore was a minor issue. What 
is important is that he wanted to talk to Singapore leaders in 
person about buying ammunition from Singapore, since the island 
state is a market place for war materiel. 
  Observers are watching the move to see whether their 
assumption is correct and whether Prince Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh did go to Singapore only for a medical checkup or also 
to buy ammunition for the Phnom Penh Government troops, which is 
conducting a military campaign in the current 16th dry season. 
Some other observers hold that Singapore's intention of selling 
ammunition to the Phnom Penh government appears to be improper, 
because ASEAN's policy toward Cambodia is to achieve national 
reconciliation and peace. This position of ASEAN is 
emphatically mentioned in the ASEAN joint communique issued in 
January 1993 specifying that ASEAN wants Cambodia to reach 
national reconciliation and to regain peace. ASEAN wants to see 
the Cambodian problem settled in accordance with the five-point 
proposal of King Norodom Sihanouk.

<F P=106> ["Clarification issued by the spokesman for the Party of </F>
Democratic Kampuchea on rumors regarding Democratic Kampuchea's 
internal affairs;" dated 29 January -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] 1. There have been rumors concerning Democratic 
Kampuchea's [DK] internal affairs. 
  2. The spokesman for the Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] 
would like to clarify that the DK is a movement of the nation 
and the people that has been building, consolidating, and 
expanding for years. The DK enjoys unity and internal 
solidarity in its policies, organization, and activities. The 
DK is carrying out noble tasks -- along with the entire 
Cambodian nation and people --to struggle and fight with a lofty 
sense of responsibility against the Vietnamese aggressors, 
territorial expansionists, and race exterminators and their 
lackeys. 
  People inside and outside of the country are aware of and 
clearly understand the PDK's role in collaborating with the 
Cambodian nation and people to liberate the nation and people 
and safeguard the Cambodian race. 
  The DK has been preserving its unity and internal solidarity 
as well as its solidarity with the nation and people. It will 
continue to do so in the future; this is vital to the DK and to 
our nation and people for many generations to come. This is the 
sole ideal and the cement that binds the DK's unity and 
solidarity; that is, love for the nation and people and the 
political platform of the Cambodian National Union Party [CNUP]. 
  Every PDK member, regardless of whether they are from the 
old 
or the new generation, carries out their task according to their 
sector and field -- that is, within the framework of this lofty 
and sacred love for the nation and people -- and firmly adheres 
to the CNUP's political platform. Historical circumstances, the 
actual situation, and current and future geopolitics require the 
DK and the CNUP to adhere to this policy and organize new and 
appropriate generations of cadres. This is aimed at maintaining 
unity and internal solidarity so as to continue to join the 
nation and people in ensuring that a Cambodian nation and people 
exist in the world and absolutely preventing today's Cambodia 
from becoming a second Kampuchea Kraom [former Cambodian 
territory now part of Vietnam]. 
  If the DK did not enjoy unity and internal solidarity, it 
would not have been able to join with the nation and people in 
carrying out successive national tasks in the face of its savage 
and brutal enemies. 
  [Dated] 29 January 1994 
  [Signed] PDK Spokesman

<F P=106> ["Appeal Issued on (?27) January by His Excellency Khieu </F>
Samphan, Chairman of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea, to Our 
Compatriots Nationwide;" place not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Dear respected and beloved compatriots: 
  I. The 23 October 1991 Paris accord has clearly stipulated 
that the Vietnamese communists should withdraw all their 
aggressor forces from Cambodia and that a quadripartite Supreme 
National Council be set up to settle the issue of national 
reconciliation. 
  The Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] has correctly and 
meticulously implemented every point of the Paris accord, 
especially the important clauses. But the Vietnamese 
aggressors, the Vietnamese communist puppets, and an alliance 
inside and outside UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia] 
have opposed the accord from the beginning. 
  II. UNTAC organized elections in violation of the Paris 
accord. However, the Cambodian people have voted for the 
FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, 
Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] Party and the PDK has 
supported the outcome of the elections the FUNCINPEC Party has 
won. This is to allow the FUNCINPEC to form a new 
(?transitional) government, to set up a parliament, to codify a 
constitution, and to establish a real national government. 
Nevertheless, the Vietnamese aggressors, who have occupied 
Cambodia for 15 years, and their puppets as well as the alliance 
have shown their opposition to this by revolting and separating 
the seven provinces bordering Vietnam. They have used force and 
pressure to form a two-headed government. In reality, real 
state power still belongs to the puppets of the Vietnamese 
communists. They have repeatedly reorganized the formation [of 
the government] in opposition to and in violation of the 
Cambodian people's wishes, democracy, and the 23 October 1991 
Paris accord. 
  III. Shortly after the creation of the two-headed 
government, the Vietnamese aggressors, the Vietnamese puppets, 
and the alliance marshalled their forces in Cambodia to attack 
the Cambodian people, national resistance forces, and Democratic 
Kampuchea [DK]. In August 1993, they began launching military 
offensives on Phnum Chhat and Stoung [District]. They created 
all kinds of disasters, burned and plundered the people's 
property, shot the people dead, and raped their children in the 
most savage manner. These actions have caused appalling 
devastation. 
  IV. On 21 November 1993, King Norodom Sihanouk put forth a 
five-point policy for national reconciliation. The PDK, like 
the Cambodian nation and people, has fully supported the royal 
policy. The five points of the royal policy are as follows: 
  A. A total and immediate cease-fire across Cambodia; 
  B. A cessation of all military activities, including 
mine-laying and so on. 
  C. Return of Preah Vihear Temple, Pailin, and other 
regions controlled by Democratic Kampuchea to the state and 
government of the Kingdom of Cambodia; 
  D. Dissolution of the National Army of Democratic 
Kampuchea and its incorporation into the Khmer Royal Armed 
Forces; and 
  E. Obligation of the government to offer the posts of 
co-ministers, deputy co-ministers, and co-state secretaries as 
well as advisory roles to PDK personages. 
  The king will appoint a PDK personage as his senior privy 
councillor. 
  In this context, the PDK, on the one hand, should cease 
having liberated zones and armed forces, while on the other, it 
should join both the government and army. This is to form an 
authentic national government and to establish an authentic 
national army. 
  The Cambodian nation and people as well as the PDK and the 
peace- and justice-loving countries of the world have supported 
the royal five-point policy with the aim of achieving national 
reconciliation. Also, among the people, the movement demanding 
national reconciliation has become increasingly vigorous. 
  V. The two-headed government, however, does not care about 
the royal five-point initiative, the national reconciliation, 
and the desire of the Cambodian nation and people and peace- and 
justice-loving countries of the world. They are only busy with: 
  A. Allowing the Vietnamese, old and new alike, to flow 
into Cambodia at will. There are now nearly four million 
Vietnamese in the country. 
  B. Attacking and attacking. 
  C. Amassing money extorted from the people to buy war 
materiel to further inflame the war. 
  D. Forcibly drafting the people and their children to 
serve as soldiers and to die on the battlefield one after 
another. 
  E. Creating thievery, banditry, and corruption; allowing 
commodities prices to go sky-high; and generating unemployment, 
beggary, and all kinds of vices. 
  F. Whatever the two-headed government is called, in 
reality it is the Vietnamese communist government that assumes 
99 percent of state power in Phnom Penh and 100 percent in the 
provinces. This includes power in the military, police, 
civilian, and all other sectors. Therefore, it is the 
two-headed government, in particular the Vietnamese communists 
and their puppets as well as the alliance that should be held 
responsible for the survival of the Cambodian nation and people. 
  National problems are becoming increasingly serious as there 
are almost four million Vietnamese communists nationwide, 
especially in eastern Cambodia. The presence of over four 
million Vietnamese has created all kinds of serious national and 
social problems. Social problems, in particular, have become 
critical. People are starving; soldiers, policemen, public 
servants, teachers, and professors have not been paid; the 
number of beggars are increasing; and the problem of corruption 
and others have become acute. 
  G. In the face of this serious situation and national and 
social problems, I wish to appeal to the compatriots: 
  1. To join hands to carry out all kinds of activities to 
stop the war waged by the Vietnamese communists, the Vietnamese 
communist puppets, and the alliance; 
  2. To join hands to conduct all kinds of activities to 
prevent the serious social situation caused by the Vietnamese 
communist aggressors' occupation of Cambodia, by the power of 
the Vietnamese communists' puppet, and by all sorts of corrupt 
practices. 
  3. To join hands to support the national reconciliation 
plan of King Norodom Sihanouk; 
  4. To join hands to carry out all kinds of activities to 
prevent and do away with the problem of corruption and the 
problem of nearly four million old and new Vietnamese in 
Cambodia, and to promote national reconciliation in accordance 
with his majesty's five-point policy. 
  Our entire nation and people have become more united under 
King Norodom Sihanouk's national reconciliation banner. The old 
and new aggressors and their puppets have become terribly 
isolated, and have already been sentenced by the entire 
Cambodian nation and people. The cause of our nation and race, 
which is in the hands of all our people, will certainly prevail 
over their atheist enemies. 
  Down with the warmongers! 
  Long live the Cambodian nation and people! 
  Long live the king's national reconciliation policy!

  [Text] Mak Ben, representative of the Party of Democratic 
Kampuchea [PDK-Khmer Rouge], at the PDK office in Phnom Penh on 
27 January talked to local and foreign reporters about the 
situation concerning the national reconciliation policy in 
accordance with the five-point initiative of Samdech Euv [prince 
father] the king. 
  Mak Ben said that Samdech Euv the king thought that in order 
to resolve the current serious situation there was only one 
magic solution, which was to reconcile the nation by uniting all 
our national forces around the king and the throne. On 21 
November 1993, the king put forward a five-point political 
initiative requiring that all national forces soften their 
respective positions so that everyone can unite and move toward 
genuine national reconciliation and peace. 
  The PDK has fully and unconditionally supported the king's 
five-point political initiative. The entire Cambodian nation 
and people in rural areas and cities and inside and outside the 
country have assisted and supported this five-point initiative. 
The world, particularly the ASEAN countries, are happy about 
the proposal and have welcomed it because they want Cambodia to 
have genuine peace and national reconciliation, which is 
conducive to peace, security, and stability in the entire region. 
  Mak Ben said that on 22 January Prince Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh sent his representative to inform the PDK 
representative in Phnom Penh that Prince Krompreah and FUNCINPEC 
[National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, 
and Cooperative Cambodia] fully accept the king's five-point 
initiative and that all the points should be implemented 
simultaneously. Furthermore, agreement was reached on setting 
up a nameless technical group for talks based on the king's 
five-point initiative. 
  Replying to the above clarification by Prince Krompreah 
Norodom Ranariddh, His Excellency [H.E.] Khieu Samphan, PDK 
chairman, expressed his joy and thanks to Prince Krompreah and 
noted that this is an important step, enabling the king's 
five-point policy to move toward realization in accordance with 
the king's lofty desire and the profound and sacred aspiration 
of the entire Cambodian nation and people. 
  It should be noted that the PDK has not demanded that any 
personalities or parties be excluded. The PDK wants to see all 
national forces united, including FUNCINPEC, the Buddhist 
Liberal Democratic Party [BLDP], the Cambodian People's Party 
[CPP], the PDK, and other national forces, in order that there 
might be genuine national reconciliation, national unity, and 
peace. 
  Previously the CPP and H.E. Hun Sen repeatedly stated that 
only three points were to be discussed. On 7 January 1994, and 
later, the CPP and H.E. Hun Sen continued to demand that DK 
accept and implement the three points first before they agree to 
talk about other issues. This is offensive to the PDK and runs 
counter to the spirit of national reconciliation and the 
rallying of national forces. 
  We hope that H.E. Hun Sen and the CPP will reconsider this 
issue, accept the royal five-point political guidance, and send 
representatives to work in the technical group in accordance 
with the united aim of Prince Krompreah and H.E. Khieu Samphan. 
This is in order to move the king's five-point initiative 
toward its realization. In the immediate future, H.E. Khieu 
Samphan suggests that the technical group start its work 
straightaway with representatives from FUNCINPEC and the PDK. 
Once H.E. Hun Sen and the CPP clearly announce acceptance of 
the royal five-point initiative, then the CPP will also be 
included. 
  Mak Ben recalled that the BLDP has also declared support for 
the king's five-point initiative.

  [Text] His Excellency [H.E.] Hun Sen reaffirmed that the 
Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] will strive to restore 
security and political stability in the country and to elevate 
Cambodia's image in the international arena. This is aimed at 
stimulating foreign investors' confidence. He stated this at an 
audience granted to Mr. Gibson Phillip Henry, extraordinary and 
plenipotentiary ambassador of New Zealand to Cambodia, at the 
Council of Ministers office on the morning of 27 January. 
  At the meeting, his excellency the second prime minister 
made 
three requests for assistance from the New Zealand Government. 
First, he asked the government to provide general vocational 
training for the Khmer Royal Armed Forces' troops; second, 
supply necessary materials for the training; and third, develop 
Cambodia [words indistinct]. If New Zealand agrees to help 
develop Cambodia, it is requested that Cambodian soldiers are 
hired as workers. This is to give them jobs and so they may 
earn their living. 
  H.E. Hun Sen also requested that New Zealand provide the RGC 
with materials, mosquito nets, blankets, and medicine which will 
be given to Khmer Rouge soldiers rallying to the RGC. The royal 
government will not ask for armaments or ammunition, he 
emphasized. 
  With regard to the Khmer Rouge problem, H.E. Hun Sen 
reaffirmed that the RGC at all times leaves open the possibility 
for them to join in national reconstruction and achieve national 
unification. This is, however, possible only if they fulfill 
the five points of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk Varaman. 
On the contrary, they have continued to attack the RGC and 
people and refuse to recognize the legal royal government. 
  Before concluding, H.E. Hun Sen profoundly thanked the New 
Zealand troops, who had taken part in the elections and mine 
clearance in Cambodia. New Zealand continues to assist Cambodia 
in the demining operation in its capacity as a state in the same 
region. 
  For his part, Mr. Phillip reaffirmed to H.E. Hun Sen that 
New 
Zealand is always ready to cooperate in rehabilitating, 
rebuilding, and redeveloping Cambodia. New Zealand, he added, 
is willing to help restore Cambodia and is prepared to share 
weal and woe with the country. Currently, New Zealand is 
striving to promote cooperation in the development of the two 
countries.

  [Text] Phnom Penh AKP January 31 -- Acting State President 
and Chairman of National Assembly Chea Sim said that the Khmer 
Rouge had not showed its fair attitude towards national 
reconciliation. 
  During a meeting with representative of Canadian diplomatic 
mission to Cambodia David Martin Colagott, Samdech Chea Sim said 
the faction still refused to recognise the Royal Government of 
Cambodia and conditions proposed by King Norodom Sihanouk on 
cease-fire, the faction's troops demobilisation and integration 
into the royal army, and the return of its controlled areas of 
Pailin and Preah Vihear to the royal government. 
  He also told the Canadian diplomat that the Khmer Rouge also 
increased its strategy in order regain power in the country. 
  The acting state president also expressed thanks to the 
Canadian government for its efforts and assistance to the peace 
process and national reconstruction of Cambodia. 
  For his part, David Martin expressed pleasure over the unity 
between the two main parties of FUNCINPEC [National United Front

and the CPP [Cambodian People's Party] in the government, 
stressing that it was the firm aspiration for Cambodians.

<F P=106> [By Kevin Barrington] </F>
  [Text] Phnom Penh, Jan 30 (AFP) -- Khmer Rouge guerrillas 
were shelling hundreds of rounds of rocket and artillery fire at 
government positions around a town near Cambodia's northern 
border with Thailand, a military officer said Sunday. 
  "Choam Khsan is still in our hands as before," the officer 
said referring to the border town in remote Preah Vihear 
province which started to come under heavy artillery attack 
early this week, with about 100 rounds being fired each day. 
  Several hundred familes fled their homes to escape the 
intense shelling and rocket fire and moved to the safety of the 
provincial capital, Tbeng Meanchey, the officer who requested 
anonymity said. 
  Many families had to leave before they could harvest their 
rice crops and hundreds of rice-fields were burnt, he said. 
  The government cooperated with aid agencies and to airlift 
in 
food and shelter Friday for more than 2,000 displaced people who 
had gathered in Tbeng Meanchey, an aid agency official said. 
  Tbeng Meanchey is currently inaccessible by road but 
government troops were reported to be trying to clear mines 
which block the road running north through a heavy Khmer Rouge 
area in central Kompong Thom province. 
  Meanwhile "serious military activities" were taking place 
around the Khmer Rouge's headquarters for all of northern 
Cambodia at Anlong Veng, Cabinet Minister Veng Sereivut said 
without elaborating. 
  Defence Minister Tie Banh said that government troops 
started 
moving on the Khmer Rouge base at Anlong Veng on Friday in a 
bigger assault than previous ones. 
  Earlier offensives in the area were called off because of 
bad 
weather and poor logisitics. 
  "Our troops should have no problems capturing that area," 
Tie 
Banh said. 
  Other government officials would not specify whether the 
advance was an all-out assault to take the base or just an 
attempt to use military pressure to push the guerrillas towards 
peace talks. 
  Reports of an impending attack have been circulating for 
weeks, confirmed by some government officials and denied by 
others. 
  A Western diplomat said that some military officials were 
reluctant to talk about activity in the area "because they 
didn't want to build up expectations and then have a failure." 
  But he said he would not be surprised if the government had 
launched a major attack. "They were pretty much gradually 
creeping towards Anlong Veng over the past two weeks," the 
diplomat said. 
  Another Western diplomat said he was aware the government 
had 
been moving men and munitions into the area for some weeks but 
could not confirm what was happening on the ground. 
  However, he questioned the military significance of 
capturing 
the base. 
  If the Khmer Rouge were faced with a large-scale attack, the 
guerrillas would probably just abandon the base like they did 
when a similar base came under heavy attack at Phum Chat in 
northwestern Cambodian last August, he said. 
  Phum Chat is right beside the Thai border and government 
officers said at the time that the guerrillas had crossed into 
Thailand and escaped. 
  "The question to ask is `Can the Khmer Rouge continue to 
abandon bases?' And if they can, `Do they have others in a 
neighbouring country?'" the diplomat said. 
  The Khmer Rouge's infamous one-legged general Ta Mok was 
based in Anlong Veng but military officials and diplomats said 
he left in December, together with a number of his men, to set 
up another command post in Preah Vihear province not far from 
Choam Khsan. 
  Attacks in the Choam Khsan district have increased since 
then.

  [Text] Report on the attack by the people and the National 
Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK-Khmer Rouge] to destroy the 
Vietnamese communist puppets' invading forces around Bavel 
District in Battambang Province. 
  It is worth recalling that the people and the NADK had 
routed 
the Vietnamese communist puppets' military offensives in the 
Bavel region of Battambang Province in early January. However, 
the Vietnamese puppets continued to massacre their fellow 
countrymen, plunder their cattle, and burn their rice crops and 
homes. This made the people extremely furious. So, between 24 
and 26 January, they joined forces with the NADK to attack and 
destroy the Vietnamese communist puppets' troops around Bavel 
District. The following are the results of the onslaught 
against the Vietnamese puppet forces: 
  1. On 26 January, a group of our forces attacked and 
completely destroyed the position of the 24th regiment from 
Division 6 stationed at Ampel Pram Daeum, the position of the 
8th battalion at Boeng Sangke, and the position of a company at 
(Siem) village. We killed 30 invaders, including a regiment 
commander and a deputy commander of the 6th division, and 
wounded many others. The remaining enemy soldiers were forced 
to beat a hasty retreat to Bavel. The people also captured two 
enemy soldiers, seized 20 assorted firearms -- including DK-75, 
80-mm, DK-82, 12.7-mm, and 60-mm guns; B-40 rocket launchers, 
and AK rifles -- and destroyed some armaments. They also 
liberated many thousands of villagers in Ampel commune. 
  2. On 26 January, over 200 people closely cooperated with 
the NADK to attack the Vietnamese communist puppets' invading 
troops in the areas of S'tha Po, Prey Khpuos, (Dei S'at), and 
Kbal Krabei. We killed 15 enemy soldiers and wounded many 
others. We also liberated many hundreds of families in S'tha Po 
village. 
  3. On 25 January, a battalion of the Vietnamese communist 
puppets planned to attack us from behind. But we ambushed it, 
killed seven enemy soldiers and wounded five others. The 
remaining troops were forced to retreat to Lvea. 
  4. On 24 January, the people and NADK attacked and routed 
invading enemy troops along Route 5 in the area between Chroy 
M'teh and (Ta Pi). We killed five enemy soldiers and wounded 10 
others, and we dismantled the Vietnamese communist puppets' 
state authorities in the following five villages: Chroy M'teh, 
Am, Ta Ping Toch, Ta Ping Thom, and Tuol Neakru. We also seized 
more than 10 assorted guns. 
  These were the counterattacks mounted by the people to 
prevent the Vietnamese communist puppets from mobilizing their 
troops for offensives. These are attacks made in self-defense 
to protect the people's lives and their property, cattle, carts, 
plows, and rice crops. 
  The people say the only way to defend their lives is to 
cooperate closely with the NADK. They also say that the entire 
Cambodian nation and people, both in the urban and rural areas, 
are now rising up. They add that they can no longer allow the 
Vietnamese communists, the Vietnamese puppets, and their 
alliance to continue inflaming the war to kill Cambodians at 
will.

  [Text] The Vietnamese communist puppets on 26 January sent 
out more than 200 troops backed by seven tanks to invade a 
liberated area north of Sre Noy [in Oddar Meanchey Province]. 
The people and the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea 
ambushed them with mines and attacked them with heavy guns on 
the stretch of road at Prey S'at, killing 12 enemy soldiers and 
wounding many others. We also seized a significant quantity of 
firearms and ammunition and captured two tanks -- one about to 
run out of gas and the other about to break down. The enemy 
ground troops and the other five tanks hastily retreated behind 
their lines.

Samraong, the seat of Oddar Meanchey Province] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Over 2,000 people were 
divided into groups to attack the Vietnamese communist puppet 
administrators and ringleaders from the western part of Samraong 
District along Route 69. They attacked and destroyed the police 
post and the site of an army engineering unit, which was in 
charge of preparing the way for suppressive operations. Another 
group of the people's forces attacked an artillery position at 
Don Ken village south of Samraong District hall. Another group 
attacked the central area, totally destroying the Oddar Meanchey 
provincial hall, the provincial seat, and Samraong District 
hall. Another group attacked the camps of the Vietnamese 
communist puppets at O Russei, destroying two positions 
belonging to the 286th Division and Nhoek Bunchhai's forces. 
Another group attacked positions in the suburban area, totally 
destroying the positions at Bos Sbouv and Trabek. 
  All groups in this people's attack linked up at Samraong 
market and occupied this area for over 3 hours. The people's 
forces destroyed the puppets' heavy military machines which were 
being used for building roads for their military trucks, as well 
as armored personnel carriers and tanks used for launching 
operations in the eastern and western parts of Route 68. They 
destroyed three [words indistinct], five [words indistinct] 
tractors, four ten-wheeled and thirteen-wheeled trucks, an oil 
truck, a water truck, two ammunition depots, two 122-mm and B-30 
cannon, three 82-mm mortars, four 12.7 guns, and two DK-75 guns. 
They also killed 36 of the enemy on the spot and wounded over 60 
others. [passage omitted].

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] On the night of 25 January, the 
people and the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] took 
the initiative in attacking the Vietnamese communist puppet 
stronghold in Stoung District, Kompong Thom Province. The 
people believe that this bridgehead should be burned to prevent 
them from attacking us. Before midnight on 25 January, the 
people and the NADK surrounded and attacked the Stoung District 
township. After an hour of fighting, we had completely occupied 
the district market and destroyed the district office buildings, 
two barracks, a police quarters, six vehicles and armored 
carriers, and a rice warehouse. We killed seven cruel district 
officials; four puppet officers holding the rank of colonel, 
major, and captain; and 12 invading enemy soldiers. We also 
wounded a number of enemy soldiers and captured 38 others. The 
other puppet troops quickly fled for their lives from the Stoung 
District township. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Phnom Penh 28 Jan (AKP) -- The Cambodian Government 
has decided to waive entry visas for Cambodia for visits of two 
weeks or less. 
  This decision was made on Wednesday, 26 January, at a 
Council 
of Ministers meeting chaired by Prince Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh and His Excellency Hun Sen, first and second prime 
ministers of the Royal Government of Cambodia respectively. The 
decision will be effective as of 1 March 1994. At present, 
foreigners must pay $20 for an entry visa at Pochentong Airport. 
  Concerning agricultural development for the period of 
1994-95, the meeting decided to impose a ban on the export of 
logs and timber, but it still authorizes the exploitation of 
wood for local needs. 
  With regard to rubber exploitation, the government has 
decided in principle to privatize rubber production. It also 
examined the project for palm oil cultivation, saying it favored 
foreign and local investments in that sector. 
  The government has also adopted [number indistinct] May as 
Water Policy Day. On that day, all citizens should participate 
in work to construct irrigation systems. They should work on 
these projects for 15 days per year.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 29 [date as received] (KCNA) -- 
The United States and the South Korean authorities are 
reportedly having consultations to hasten the projected 
deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea. 
  It is an unpardonable grave military challenge of keying up 
the tensions on the Korean peninsula to scheme to introduce 
Patriot missiles in South Korea at a time when DPRK-U.S. 
contacts have taken place and the third round of DPRK-U.S. 
talks are expected for a fundamental solution to the nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  The hostile forces of the United States and the South Korean 
puppet clique claim that the deployment of Patriot missiles is 
to "counter the threat of missile attack from North Korea." But 
this is no more than a plea to justify their dangerous 
introduction of lethal weapons. 
  The real purpose of their massive shipment of Patriot 
missiles into South Korea under the pretext of "threat of 
missile attack" is to impede the progress of the DPRK-U.S. 
talks for a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula and impose their unreasonable demand for 
"nuclear inspection" on the DPRK through pressure and threat. 
  If the United States and its followers think they can subdue 
the DPRK with pressure and threat, it is a big mistake. That 
method may lead the situation to a hopeless phase, far from 
resolving the problem.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 30 (KCNA) -- The Pusan Alliance 
for Democracy and National Reunification released a statement 
Saturday denouncing the United States and the South Korean 
puppet clique for scheming to deploy Patriot missiles in South 
Korea, according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  The statement said that "the U.S. projected deployment of 
Patriot missiles may make difficult the negotiations between the 
North and the International Atomic Energy Agency on nuclear 
inspection and lead to a war." 
  It said that "the plan is entirely contradictory to the 
universal trend toward peace and reconciliation" and urged its 
immediate withdrawal. 
  The organisation strongly demanded that the South Korean 
puppet authorities refuse introducing missiles which will bring 
the situation of the Korean peninsula to the brink of war.

  [Text] Tokyo, January 28 (KNS-KCNA) -- The Federation of 
South Koreans in Japan for Democracy and Unification 
(Hantongnyon) released a statement today denouncing the arms 
buildup of the U.S. imperialists in South Korea. 
  Recalling that the U.S. defence deputy undersecretary and 
state deputy undersecretary recently announced many Patriot 
intercepting missiles, fighter planes and warships would be 
brought into South Korea and other large-scale joint military 
maneuvers be staged even if the "Team Spirit" was suspended, the 
statement condemned their belligerent outburst. 
  The statement said: 
  "The military crisis created by the United States on the 
Korean peninsula has reached a dangerous phase. 
  "If the negotiations between the North of Korea and the 
United States progress in line with the `solution in a package 
deal' including the settlement of the nuclear issue and the 
improvement of the DPRK-U.S. relations, military tension would 
be drastically defused, peace and denuclearization be promoted 
on the peninsula and, further, a favorable climate be provided 
for peaceful reunification of the North and the South. 
  "The latest move of the United States is not only a grave 
obstacle to the solution to the nuclear issue but also a 
criminal act threatening the existence of the Korean nation. 
  "We strongly demand that the decision to deploy Patriot 
missiles in South Korea be immediately cancelled and all the 
military maneuvres including the provocative `Team Spirit' joint 
military exercises be discontinued. 
  "The United States must, instead of bringing such 
sophisticated weapons as Patriot missiles into South Korea, cut 
back armaments, stop all kinds of military exercises there and 
hold the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks as early as 
possible."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "A Trick To Appease Public </F>
Opinion"] 
  [Text] It was recently revealed that Kim Chong-hwi, who was 
senior assistant for diplomatic and security affairs in 
Chongwadae [presidential offices] during the Sixth Republic era 
and who now lives in the United States as a fugitive, has 
recently applied for permanent residency in the United States. 
  Concerning this, the South Korean ruling bunch is kicking 
off 
a row, such as requesting that the United States not grant his 
permanent residency and extend his visa, as well as requesting 
that his whereabouts be established. 
  However, this is no more than a deceitful trick to appease 
the heated public opinion. 
  It is common knowledge that Kim Chong-hwi, who worked as 
senior assistant for diplomatic and security affairs at 
Chongwadae during the Sixth Republic era, is one of the key 
figures involved in irregularities committed in the course of 
weapons transactions with the United States under the signboard 
of Yulgok Project [ROK weapons procurement program]. 
  Kim Chong-hwi secretly ran away to the United States last 
April under the tacit approval of the incumbent ruling bunch 
because the public's attention was focused on him and his 
irregularities were exposed. 
  However, the people's voice demanding his summons and that 
he 
be dealt with according to the law has not been pacified for 
nearly a year. 
  Because his request for permanent residency in the United 
States was exposed recently, the Democratic Party--the 
opposition party--in a statement urged the puppet authorities to 
summon him without fail. Even Korean residents in the United 
States launched a signature campaign and struggle to oppose Kim 
Chong-hwi's asylum in the United States. 
  Embarrassed by this, the Kim Yong-sam group kicked off a row 
about a so-called request and so forth. However, it has no 
intention, even to the slightest degree, to call him to Seoul, 
because various Sixth Republic corruption acts and 
irregularities, which have been concealed behind the black 
curtain, and crimes of the incumbent rulers who are related with 
such corruption and irregularities, as well as crimes of the 
civilian ruling bunch which helped him flee to the United 
States, would be fully exposed to the entire world if Kim 
Chong-hwi, who has a lot of intelligence materials because he 
was in charge of diplomatic and security affairs during the 
Sixth Republic, is summoned to Seoul and is made to stand trial. 
  The puppets' so-called request to the United States, and so 
forth are no more than a poor trick to appease the people's 
increasing demand for his summons, by pretending that they are 
making efforts to summon him. 
  This is proven by the fact that although they described Kim 
Chong-hwi's request for permanent residency as deplorable and as 
an act going against common sense, and so forth, the puppets 
recently stood back a step, saying that drastic measures are 
difficult, and the like. Moreover, the puppet Foreign Ministry 
was aware of his request for permanent residency long before the 
press reported it. Nevertheless, instead of preventing his 
request the puppet Foreign Ministry kept it secret. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group is now indeed embarrassed by this 
incident. In addition to Kim Chong-hwi, Yi Won-cho, National 
Assemblyman from the Democratic Liberal Party; Yi Yong-man, 
finance minister during the Sixth Republic; and many other 
criminals fled overseas since the so-called civilian government 
came to office. 
  If the Kim Yong-sam group only summons and imprisons Kim 
Chong-hwi, the people will raise voices of criticism that his 
imprisonment, while leaving others who fled with its help free, 
is unfair. And if the Kim Yong-sam group does not arrest him, 
the people's protest will increase. Therefore, the puppets are 
indeed at a loss. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group is gravely worried that the crimes of 
the Sixth Republic and its own crimes committed in collusion 
with the Sixth Republic will be exposed through the mouths of 
the fugitives when they are called to Seoul. This is why the 
puppets do not want to summon Kim Chong-hwi, although they are 
loudly talking about the request and so forth. 
  All facts show that the incumbent ruling bunch is deeply 
involved in various corruption acts and irregularities of the 
Sixth Republic and that the reform drive, parting from the Sixth 
Republic, eradication of irregularities without sanctuary, and 
so on, which the puppets have loudly talked about to date, are 
all a deception. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group is the guard who protects criminals 
who committed various irregularities during the Sixth Republic 
era. As long as such a group remains in power, corruption and 
irregularities will not be eradicated in South Korea. 
  In fact, Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, the ringleaders of 
various corruption and irregularities during the Fifth and Sixth 
Republics, are still active under the protection of the 
incumbent authorities. Besides, incidents of various 
irregularities, including large-scale financial fraud, have been 
exposed one after another. 
  The fact that society becomes corrupt and irregularities are 
rampant under the corrupt politics is a phenomenon that cannot 
be prevented. The Kim Yong-sam group, the supporter and 
protector of such irregularities, should be removed from power 
in order to eradicate corruption and irregularities in South 
Korea.

Confrontation" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 29 (KCNA) -- The confrontation 
atmosphere persists on the Korean peninsula because the 
traitorous Kim Yong-sam group of South Korea under the 
"civilian" veil is committing anti-national, anti-reunification 
crimes, says NODONG SINMUN in an article today. 
  The author of the article notes: 
  If the Kim Yong-sam group truly wanted national 
reconciliation and unity and reunification, it, first of all, 
must have reformed the anti-national, anti-reunification ruling 
system set up by the successive military dictatorial "regimes" 
in South Korea. By invoking the "National Security Law" the 
successive rulers of South Korea barred travel and contact 
between North and South, blocked national reconciliation and 
unity and tied fast the patriotic pro-reunification democratic 
figures in South Korea who hoped for reconciliation and unity 
with the North and harshly persecuted them, incriminating their 
slightest move. 
  It is preposterous to talk about reunification, while 
leaving 
intact in South Korea the confrontation system with legal and 
institutional mechanisms which totally negate and block national 
reconciliation, unity and reunification itself. Nevertheless, 
the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, while advertising "reform", is 
keeping the whole of the anti-communist confrontation system of 
the successive military dictatorial "regimes." 
  Worse still the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is on the run day 
in and day out to beat fellow countrymen on the back with the 
help of outside forces, crying for "international cooperation 
system" and "sanctions" over the "nuclear problem". 
  The anti-national acts of the traitorous Kim Yong-sam clique 
strip bare the anti-national color of the "civilian government" 
pursuing North-South confrontation. 
  As long as the treacherous North-South confrontation system 
against national reconciliation and unity is kept in South Korea 
and such a separatist as the traitor Kim Yong-sam is left alone, 
it is only too clear that one grave obstacle after another will 
be laid in the way of the struggle for a great unity of our 
nation and national reunification. 
  The situation gives a serious lesson that the South Korean 
people and democratic forces must not place hope on the 
"civilian government" but smash the anti-reunification moves of 
the Kim Yong-sam traitor clique with a massive struggle.

<F P=106> ["Crafty Sermon for Crackdown on Labor Movement" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 31 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Yong-sam told chairmen of comprador groups at "Chongwadae" a few 
days ago that "trinity" of the "government," the employers and 
workers should be established for "the increase of international 
competitiveness." 
  NODONG SINMUN today brands the "trinity" as a slogan of the 
puppet authorities and comprador entrepreneurs to crack down on 
the workers' struggle for wage hike and vital rights under the 
pretext of "economic stability" and "increase of 
competitiveness." 
  The news analyst says: 
  That day the traitor Kim Yong-sam preached "labor-management 
harmony", saying rather "humane treatment" is necessary than 
wage hike in order to make this year "the first year free from 
labor-management disputes." This is quite ill-intentioned. 
  By "labor-management harmony" he meant that the workers must 
refrain from any demand and any protest but meekly yield to the 
exploitation by the employers. 
  Kim Yong-sam told the businessmen that he would loosen the 
"regulations" obstructive to business activities to the extent 
that the employers are satisfied. 
  Although Kim Yong-sam wants the workers to work silently 
without protesting to the "government" and the employers, it is 
a futile dream. 
  The South Korean workers and people will not be cheated by 
the traitor's sermon on "labor-management harmony" and "trinity" 
but rise up courageously in the struggle to overthrow the 
"civilian"-veiled regime.

  [Text] U.S. religious leader Billy Graham, who is currently 
visiting our country, gave a speech at the People's Great Hall 
of Study on 30 January. 
  Saying that he had the great honor of meeting with the great 
President Kim Il-song, Reverend Graham said he rejoiced over the 
meeting. Noting that he is currently reading the great leader's 
memoirs zealously, he said: After having learned the fact that 
Christian followers actively supported the great President Kim 
Il-song's revolutionary activities through his memoirs, I was as 
delighted as the followers were. He added that Rev. Son Pyong-no 
had helped President Kim Il-song a great deal and noted that the 
reverend's family enjoyed being with President Kim Il-song. The 
great leader is a strong and wise leader. 
  He continued to say that he is well acquainted with the dear 
leader and stated that all DPRK people highly respect him. 
Recalling the fact that this is his second visit, he said: New 
streets are laid in Pyongyang. Pyongyang is beautiful, clean, 
and brilliant. A smile is on everybody's face and I can clearly 
read the DPRK people's state of mind. I can never forget my 
Pyongyang visit. 
  Touching on the fact that the DPRK people experienced agony 
and sorrow for almost half a century due to the country's 
division, Rev. Graham said: I can feel their agony and sorrow 
deeply. However, I cannot fully understand those feelings since 
I am not a party concerned. As I said two years ago during my 
Pyongyang visit, the United States and the former Soviet Union 
are responsible for the Korean division. The two countries 
pursued their interests in Korea, a weak power. Even nowadays, 
there are many cases of big powers demanding sacrifices from 
weak powers. I hope my current visit will contribute to reunify 
Korea and promote DPRK-U.S. relations. I visited your country 
out of responsibility that I will do my utmost for peace and 
reconciliation. I would like to pray for the great President 
Kim Il-song and thank the leaders [yongdoja] of the DPRK. 
  Kang Yong-sop, chairman of the Central Committee of the 
Korean Christian Federation; and Chong Chae-chol, chairman of 
the Central Committee of the Korea Catholics Association; 
religious followers and residents of Pyongyang were present.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 31 (KCNA) -- U.S. religious 
leader Rev. Billy Graham now on a visit to the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea was interviewed by reporters in 
Pyongyang today.

spending 
private times and the lunch with the great leader," he said. 
  Referring to his visit to Kim Il-song University and the 
three revolution exhibition, he said: "I have been fully 
interested in large machinery and also the beautiful clothes

experience and I'll never forget being among the people of this 
country," he said.

He said: "Wherever I go, various countries have economic 
problems. We, in the United States, have same serious economic 
problems.

can 
be done now will help you in the future."

he said: "I see the responsible people and hear the beautiful 
singing. I say the order is disciplined here among the people."

nation for the reunification of the country' needs a great deal 
of study," he said, stressing "I am for the unification of the 
country." 
  "The great leader has said that he hopes the country's 
reunification would be done during the 1990s. So do I," the 
pastor noted.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 29 (KCNA) -- The director of the 
Defence Agency of Japan, Kazuo Aichi, reportedly told a press 
conference that "the suspicion concerning North Korea's nuclear 
development is ever increasing" and "North Korea is the biggest 
factor of instability in Asia." 
  We cannot but take a serious view of his preposterous 
sophism, which is an intolerable insult to the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea. 
  His utterances reveal a base scheme to impose unreasonable 
"nuclear inspections" on the DPRK at any cost with international 
pressure by spreading again the rumor of the DPRK's "suspected 
nuclear development." 
  This "suspicion" is an offspring of the U.S. anti-socialist, 
anti-DPRK moves. It is a fiction. 
  It is really ridiculous of Japan to cry over "a factor of 
instability in Asia" and "a global problem", basing itself on 
this fiction. 
  It is only too clear that Japan itself is the biggest factor 
of instability in Asia. 
  Japan's moves to become a military power equipped with 
nuclear arms, which are entering a dangerous stage, pose a 
potential, grave threat to peace and security not only in Asia 
but in the world. 
  The scheme of the Japanese reactionaries to develop the 
"Theatre Missile Defence" system in collusion with the United 
States is a grave threat and open challenge to the Korean people. 
  While crying for the "Theatre Missile Defence" system, Aichi 
twaddled about "Japan-U.S. security system" and South 
Korea-U.S. "alliance." This revealed the sinister intention to 
strengthen the U.S.-Japan-South Korea "tripartite military 
alliance" and contain the DPRK militarily. 
  It is, however, a foolish daydream. 
  The Japanese reactionaries must abandon the habit of 
caviling 
at others and give up their moves to convert Japan into a 
nuclear power and military power, which pose a threat to peace 
and security in Asia and the world.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 29 (KCNA) -- A national seminar 
on the chuche idea was held in Kigali on Jan. 15 on the 
threshold of the birthday of the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il. 
  Mbonigaba Stanislas, chairman of the Rwandan Committee for 
the Study of the Chuche Idea, made a keynote report on the 
subject "philosophical principle and socio-historical principle 
of chuche idea." 
  He said the chuche idea founded by his excellency the great 
leader President Kim Il-song raised the fundamental question of 
philosophy with man in the centre and expounded the 
philosophical principle that man is the master of everything and 
decides everything, thus establishing a man-centred new outlook 
on the world. 
  The reporter said: "The imperialists and international 
reactionaries find themselves powerless before socialist Korea 
because the DPRK has an ideological and moral weapon -- 
singlehearted unity -- which is mightier than A-bomb." 
  "This ideological and moral weapon of the Korean people is 
noble and invincible because it was prepared through arduous 
trials in history," he added. 
  Rudahunga Ignace, vice-chairman of the Rwandan Committee for 
the Study of the Chuche Idea, in his report on the subject 
"guiding principles of chuche idea" said the guiding principles 
of the chuche idea indicate the fundamental principles in 
maintaining the independent and creative stand and successfully 
carrying out the revolution and construction with the enhanced 
role of ideology. 
  "If the chuche idea is to be applied in the revolution and 
construction, its guiding principles must be observed," he said. 
  The speakers at the seminar dwelt on the validity of the 
philosophical principle of the chuche idea and stressed the need 
to apply the guiding principles of this idea in conformity with 
the specific conditions of Rwanda. 
  A congratulatory message to Comrade Kim Chong-il was adopted 
at the seminar.

<F P=106> ["Victory of Revolution is Victory of Faith and Will" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 28 (KCNA) -- The victory of 
revolution is the victory of faith and will, declares NODONG 
SINMUN in a by-lined article today. 
  It quotes the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as saying: 
  "The stand and resolution with which the leader shapes 
politics may lead the country and the nation to prosperity and 
development or to decay and ruin." 
  The article notes: 
  What is of decisive significance in steadfastly defending 
the 
cause of socialism and carrying it to completion is the 
unshakable faith and will of the leader who guides the 
revolution in the van. 
  We cannot think of uninterrupted, great advance in our 
revolution and construction apart from the dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il who is leading our party, people and revolutionary 
Armed Forces to victory with iron will and faith. 
  The firmness and steadfastness of his faith and will are 
fully demonstrated in that he meets and foils whatever challenge 
of the enemy, undaunted by it in the slightest. 
  No matter what offensive the imperialists launched in all 
fields of politics, military, economy and diplomacy, rendering 
the situation complicated, he has smashed it with bold offensive 
spirit and superb operation. 
  His firm grit and will was invariable in the hard time last 
year when a touch-and-go situation was created due to the 
enemy's reckless nuclear clamor and the "Team Spirit" joint 
military maneuvers. The decisive self-defensive measure in 
putting the whole country, the entire people and all the Army in 
a semi-war state and the militant slogan calling for launching a 
great revolutionary offensive in the same spirit displayed in 
the rigorous Fatherland Liberation War -- this was our answer to 
the enemy who was trying to crush the sovereignty of the nation 
with the sword of aggression. 
  This indomitable will of our party encouraged our people to 
display unyielding heroism. 
  The firmness of Comrade Kim Chong-il's faith and will is 
also 
manifested in that once he makes a decision and sets a target he 
fulfills them without fail in any circumstances. 
  When difficulties and obstacles lie ahead, he finds a 
solution and takes the lead in making a breakthrough. He also 
inspires the soldiers with the conviction of sure victory and 
optimism, cultivates their courage as revolutionaries and 
encourages them to perform heroic feats. And once a thing is 
started, he daringly carries it to completion, although many new 
political matters crop up. Such revolutionary spirit, 
revolutionary leadership and stubbornness are the traits of his 
leadership. As he has such a strong will, all his plans and 
instructions bear fine fruits. 
  Our party has unfolded a grand plan to further increase our 
economic might and remarkably improve the people's living in the 
near future and is now dynamically stepping up the grand 
socialist march to carry it into practice. Led by the great 
party our people will surely fulfill the heavy revolutionary 
tasks successfully and secure a new base for reaching a higher 
level in socialist construction. 
  The steadfastness of Comrade Kim Chong-il's faith and will 
finds a clear expression also in that he always firmly maintains 
the principles of revolution and the stand of the working class 
in any circumstances. 
  It is the unshakable stand of the dear leader that one must 
not depart from the principle, although flexible tactics and 
methods may be adopted depending on the given circumstances, and 
one must not make any concession in the fundamental interests of 
the revolution, no matter which way the wind may blow and 
whatever thorny road one may traverse. 
  The resoluteness of our party in keeping to the principle of 
the revolution to the end is demonstrated more clearly when the 
ruling parties in socialist countries have degenerated and 
socialist system has collapsed. When others vociferated about 
"political pluralism" and "multi-party system", it has cemented 
the singlehearted unity of the whole society and tirelessly 
increased its leading function in every way. When others were 
introducing corrupt and degenerated bourgeois ideology and 
culture under the motto "liberalisation of thought", it has made 
the whole society pervade with the sound way of life of the 
working class and communist traits. This eloquently shows the 
unshakable principled stand of our party. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is leading the party, 
the people and the revolutionary Armed Forces with his iron 
faith and will because he is unfailingly loyal and devoted to 
the revolutionary cause of chuche started by the great leader. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il has been able to lead the cause of 
socialism with steadfast faith and will because he firmly 
believed in the inexhaustible strength of the Korean people. 
  As long as there is the strong bond between the leader and 
the people, all the victories of the Korean revolution will in 
the future, too, shine as victories of revolutionary faith and 
indomitable will.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 30 (KCNA) -- Kenichi Ogami, 
secretary general of the International Institute of the Chuche 
Idea and permanent chairman of the Japanese Society for the 
Study of Kimilsongism, made public a treatise titled 
"Illustrious Leader Leads the 21st Century." 
  The lengthy treatise underlines the significance of the 
inauguration of the society for the study of works of Kim 
Chong-il and its strengthening and development. 
  The treatise consists of "1. President Kim Il-song who has 
built anthropocentric socialism", "2. Question of succeeding to 
revolution is key to ultimate victory of socialism", "3. 
Characteristics of Secretary Kim Chong-il in ideology and 
theory, exploits and humanity" and "4. Towards inauguration of 
national organization of societies for the study of works of Kim 
Chong-il." 
  In the first part, the treatise points out that President 
Kim 
Il-song has founded the chuche idea, a new revolutionary idea, 
with the popular masses, the subject of socio-historical 
development and revolutionary movement, as the main, in a new 
historical atmosphere in which the independence of the popular 
masses has been strengthened and the world revolutionary 
movement waged on an independent basis in the 20th century. 
  The building of anthropocentric socialism in Korea, the 
first 
of its kind in history, embodying the chuche idea is the 
greatest exploit performed by President Kim Il-song for human 
history. 
  It says: 
  Despite the vicious offensives and slanders of the 
imperialists and reactionaries, President Kim Il-song has pushed 
aside all difficulties, built socialism centred on the masses, 
the only in the world, at an Asian corner and is maintaining and 
developing it with pride. 
  However vicious the offensives and slanders of the 
imperialists and reactionaries may be, Korean-style socialism 
centred on the masses will never be collapsed. 
  Because socialism of Korea has struck deep roots among the 
popular masses. 
  In the second part, the treatise points out that the 
question 
of succeeding to revolution is the key to the ultimate victory 
of socialism and that it is not too much to say that all 
socialist countries except Korea have failed in the question of 
succeeding to revolution and the question of a successor. 
  It is of universal significance that Secretary Kim Chong-il 
has emerged as a successor to the revolution who is carrying 
forward and developing the leadership of President Kim Il-song, 
the treatise says, and adds: 
  The right settlement of the question of succeeding to the 
revolution and the question of a successor for the first time in 
Korea not only provides a guarantee for the ultimate victory of 
the Korean revolution but also opens a bright future ahead of 
the revolutionary struggle of all countries. 
  In the third part, the treatise refers to the 
characteristics 
of ideology and theory, exploits and humanity of secretary Kim 
Chong-il. 
  One of the exploits of Secretary Kim Chong-il in ideology 
and 
theory is that he has systematized and formularized the 
revolutionary idea of President Kim Il-song. 
  He formularized the revolutionary idea of the president as 
Kimilsongism, an integrated system of the ideology, theory and 
method of the chuche idea, on the basis of his deep study of the 
basic principle and the quintessence of the chuche idea created 
by President Kim Il-song and on the philosophical principle of 
the chuche idea. 
  The ideology, the theory and the method are components of 
Kimilsongism. 
  The ideology systematizes the independent demand of mankind, 
the theory gives a systematic exposition of the prospect, ways 
and tasks to realize the independent demand of the masses and 
the method systematizes the method of guidance to awaken, 
organize and powerfully arouse the masses in the revolutionary 
struggle. 
  What is important in the ideological and theoretical 
contents 
of the chuche idea enriched by Secretary Kim Chong-il is that he 
has developed the chuche idea on a philosophical principle, 
clarified the superiority of socialism to capitalism in an 
all-round way and elucidated the law of social development on 
the basis of the intrinsic demand of mankind. 
  The ideological and theoretical exploits of Secretary Kim 
Chong-il lie in that he has made the masses accept the chuche 
idea as their own. 
  A great exploit of Secretary Kim Chong-il as a leader of the 
revolution is that he has strengthened the party and enhanced 
its leadership role so as to bring the creativity of the masses 
into full play. 
  The principle maintained by Secretary Kim Chong-il in 
strengthening the party and enhancing its leadership role is to 
establish the party's leadership system to the letter and direct 
big efforts to the ideological education in the party's 
activities after advancing an ideological theory. 
  What is outstanding in many exploits accomplished by 
Secretary Kim Chong-il is that he has turned the whole society 
into socio-political organism with the leader, the party and the 
masses united as one. 
  Korea's is a society of an integral whole rallied firm 
around 
President Kim Il-song and Secretary Kim Chong-il. The party 
finds itself among the masses and devotedly works for them 
holding aloft the slogan "We serve the people!" The masses 
accept the tasks set forth by the party as their vital demand 
and carry them through unconditionally under the slogan "When 
the party is determined we can do anything". Through the social 
realities of Korea we can see the most solid unity of 
collectives formed by human beings. 
  The high quality of humanity of Secretary Kim Chong-il as an 
illustrious leader is infinite loyalty and devotion to the 
leader and the party, the revolution and the people, stronger 
sense of respect for the revolutionary seniors than others' and 
boundless love for the comrades and the people. 
  All the activities of Secretary Kim Chong-il are 
characterized by politics of love and trust. 
  "Belief in people as in heaven": To regard the people as the 
heaven was the motto of President Kim Il-song, while Secretary 
Kim Chong-il has respected the people as the greatest and takes 
it as his creed to regard them as the heaven. 
  As the Korean people actually feel that Secretary Kim 
Chong-il who is devotedly working for the people is, indeed, a 
genuine leader of the people, they hold him in high esteem on 
the basis of their faith and will. 
  In the fourth part, the treatise points to the tasks to 
firmly build up and expand the organization of the societies for 
the study of works of Kim Chong-il in an organizational and 
ideological way. 
  The world will, in the future, usher in a new era when the 
chuche idea is applied in an all-round way and brought into full 
play under the guidance of Secretary Kim Chong-il. Without 
learning from Secretary Kim Chong-il it is impossible to look 
forward into a new era of mankind. 
  It is necessary to push ahead with the work of studying and 
disseminating the chuche idea with a bright prospect for the 
future and a clear cut method to shape it out, deeply learning 
from the ideology and theory, exploits and humanity of Secretary 
Kim Chong-il. 
  On the basis of the achievements we the entire members of 
the 
society will inaugurate the national organization of the 
societies for the study of works of Kim Chong-il on the occasion 
of the February 16, 1994, the 52nd birthday of secretary Kim 
Chong-il by vigorously pushing on with the work to inaugurate 
the society for the study of works of Kim Chong-il in all 
regions and among the people of various strata. 
  The inauguration of the national organization of the 
societies for the study of works of Kim Chong-il will be a 
turning point in exerting a big ideological influence on the 
activities of studying and disseminating the chuche idea in 
Japan and the social movement as a whole and serve as a banner 
showing how the study and dissemination of the chuche idea will 
be conducted in the world.

<F P=106> [By Yoshihisa Komori] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 25 Jan -- With the Japan-U.S. framework 
trade talks still deadlocked, criticism has begun to emerge 
among officials in some quarters of the Foreign Ministry, 
including the Japanese Embassy in the United States, against the 
hard-line attitude the Japanese Government is currently taking 
in the trade talks. The officials admit it was a mistake for 
the Japanese Government to turn its back on the "general idea" 
that clearly admits to the low level of market openness in 
Japan. They feel that Japanese negotiators have lost sight of 
the broad trade issues involved and have been forced to focus 
their attention on countering U.S. negotiators on the 
"particulars" of the issues. The officials are concerned that, 
as a result, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's planned visit to 
the United States will achieve nothing. Their views apparently 
reflect such concerns. 
  Vice ministerial talks were held in Washington on 25 January 
to discuss the issues, but both sides refused to make any 
concessions. At this rate, it has become increasingly unlikely 
that there will be practical results from the 11 February talks 
between Prime Minister Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  With such grim prospects in view, officials in some quarters 
of the Foreign Ministry, including the Japanese Embassy in the 
United States, who watch Japanese-U.S. relations closely, have 
reportedly deepened their "concern about the growing feeling of 
distrust between Japanese and U.S. negotiators." 
  In the framework trade talks, the United States has argued 
that the microeconomic (individual) sectors of government 
procurement, insurance services, and automobiles and auto parts 
in Japan "are less open than the U.S. and European markets, and 
the concept of horizontal international specialization (in which 
nations mutually import and export industrial products to 
supplement each other) is still underdeveloped there; therefore, 
it is necessary to resolve the problem by increasing imports in 
services as well as products to correct the imbalance in 
bilateral current account payments." The Japanese Foreign 
Ministry officials noted above feel this argument is essentially 
correct. 
  Meanwhile, the Japanese Government officials directly in 
charge of trade negotiations have been at odds with U.S. 
negotiators. They have presented the following three principles 
to the Americans: 1) market access should proceed on a two-way 
basis; 2) the setting of numerical targets should be rejected; 
and 3) the scope of government responsibility must be clarified. 
  The critical Foreign Ministry officials noted above complain 
that "although it is undeniable that the issue of Japanese 
market access has been taken lightly by Japanese negotiators, it 
seems they have devoted themselves to refuting U.S. arguments on 
the `particulars' of the three principles and rejected the 
`general idea' itself." 
  Japanese negotiators have also demanded the United States 
abolish government control of insurance services and government 
procurement on the basis of a "two-way traffic" principle. The 
Foreign Ministry dissenters say: "Japan should actively deal 
with the government procurement system and insurance business 
market access as problems in themselves. Taking up U.S. 
problems could make the Americans think Japan is trying to avoid 
the real issues." The officials also say: "If demands on the 
United States are not kept to a minimum, the whole purpose of 
the framework trade talks will be lost." 
  Such criticism has also been presented to Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata in the form of a statement of opinion. It has 
resulted in the unusual situation of bureaucratic domination of 
the trade talks being condemned by bureaucrats. The dissenters 
have also urged Japan to make more concessions on automobiles 
and auto parts, saying: "Although it is true there has been a 
lack of effort by U.S. automakers to export to Japan, there is, 
on the other hand, room for Japanese car dealer organizations to 
improve the closed nature of the market and understanding of the 
regulations involved." 
  Among these critical Foreign Ministry bureaucrats, are some 
who feel no real progress in the framework trade talks can be 
made before the Japan-U.S. summit meeting. As a result they 
suggest that Prime Minister Hosokawa should take the opportunity 
to formally reexamine the improper attitude Japan has taken in 
the bilateral trade talks. Among the unfair claims Japan has 
made in the past are: "Japanese snow is different (so 
foreign-made skis cannot be imported)"; "there are no 
differences in prices between Japan and abroad"; "U.S.-made 
metal baseball bats are dangerous (so they cannot be imported)"; 
and "foreign drugs are too strong for the Japanese (so they 
cannot be imported)." 
  The critics say Prime Minister Hosokawa should frankly 
admit that such a narrow-minded, erroneous approach has been 
taken solely by bureaucrats themselves. They also say that in 
certain circumstances, Hosokawa should even express an 
"apology," stressing the difference between "administration" and 
"bureaucracy" by clarifying that he does not intend to support 
such bureaucrats or their ideas. The critics feel that if 
Hosokawa can appear to have such a bold understanding and 
positive attitude toward market opening, the atmosphere in the 
United States would considerably improve even if concrete 
results are not achieved in the framework trade talks. They 
feel this would act as a "stop-gap measure" for several months 
and help put off the crisis.

  [Text] Washington, JIJI -- A senior U.S. Government 
official warned on 26 January that if the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks end in failure, the United States would use 
sanctions as a weapon to press Japan to open its market. 
President Clinton met on 25 January with other U.S. Government 
officials to review the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. 
The same senior U.S. Government official made it clear that 
during the meeting, President Clinton approved of U.S. 
negotiators taking a tough stance and making no concessions at 
the bilateral economic framework talks. 
  The same senior U.S. Government official also disclosed that 
during the meeting, a U.S. official, while pointing out that no 
substantial progress has been made in the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks, stressed the need for both Japan and the United 
States to work to make a success of the Japan-U.S. summit talks 
scheduled for 11 February, and asserted that the talks should 
hammer out trade accords beneficial to the United States.

  [Text] It has been disclosed that at the Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks on the auto and auto parts sectors, the 
United States has presented a 12-point demand for improvement, 
maintaining "the Japanese system on auto standards and 
authorization constitutes an import barrier." Included in these 
demands are: procedures for inspection of imported cars should 
be simplified; regulations on standards for designating 
car-inspection factories should be eased; and information on car 
registrations should be made available. These are additional 
demands to those the United States has made since 1992 when 
(then) U.S. President Gorge Bush brought up a 14-point demand 
for improvements during his visit to Japan. Japan intends to 
have these problems settled at the consultations held between 
experts from the two nations; however, since it will be 
difficult for Japan to agree to certain demands, it is now faced 
with another problem in addition to the issue of setting 
"numerical targets." 
  Regarding the 14-point demand that President Bush made 
during 
his visit to Japan, consultations have continued at the talks 
between Japanese and American experts specializing in auto 
standards and authorization systems. So far, an accord has been 
reached on accepting the U.S. system of testing brakes. 
However, other problems such as the acceptance of U.S. 
standards on exhaust emissions remain to be settled. Therefore, 
in addition to these problems, the United States has brought up 
other demands at the framework talks. 
  Concerning simplification of import procedures, the United 
States demands that the PHP [expansion unknown] system which 
gives special treatment to imported cars -- whereby import of a 
small number of cars requires only documentary inspection -- be 
further simplified. It was also demanded that the government's 
inspection of each imported car be eliminated and, moreover, 
that the number of facilities designated for car inspection be 
increased. This is because the United States believes that once 
the number of such facilities is increased, the market for 
U.S.-made auto parts will be expanded. In concrete terms, the 
United States demands that when applying for designation as a 
car-inspection facility, each center should be required to have 
at least one, but not necessarily two, qualified mechanics. 
  In addition, the United States demands that for the purpose 
of recalls (of defective cars for free repair), information on 
car registrations (individual registration data) under the 
control of the Ministry of Transport [MOT] should be made 
available; and that the MOT should take measures to publicize 
use of U.S.-made parts among various garages. 
  With regard to these demands, Japan is rather puzzled 
because 
"many of these demands were brought up because of 
misunderstanding on the part of the United States" (as stated by 
an MOT source). For example, an inspection is, in principle, 
required for every new car whether it is domestically 
manufactured or imported. Moreover, when "the system of model 
designation," based on which the MOT approves the system of 
quality control for certain models, is adopted, manufacturers 
can apply for inspection procedures on behalf of users. 
  With the issue of making individual registration data 
available, the Japanese side maintains that "since the data are 
made available to manufacturers for the purposes of analyzing 
statistics or for recalls, there is no discrimination against 
foreign manufacturers."

  [Text] A senior official in the U.S. Association of 
Automobile Industries has said that at Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks, U.S. negotiators had asked their Japanese 
counterparts to go along with a U.S. demand for setting a target 
for selling 100,000 American-built cars three years later on the 
Japanese market. Commenting on the U.S. official's remark at a 
regular news conference on 27 January, Hideaki Kumano, 
administrative vice minister of the Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry [MITI], said: "The Japanese Government cannot 
commit itself to goods that Japanese consumers buy. The U.S. 
demand cited by the official is out of the question and an 
inconceivable concept."

  [Text] The "Scholars Group Against Managed Trade," 
composed of 154 Japanese and foreign economists and political 
scientists (headed by Kazuo Ueda, a professor at the Economics 
Department of Tokyo University), held a news conference on 27 
January to announce its policy proposal against setting 
numerical targets which the United States has sought at the 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. As for the numerical 
targets, the policy proposal criticized it as "something that 
promotes government-led managed trade." The policy proposal 
warned that if Japan accepts numerical targets, it would bring 
economic and political losses to Japan. 
  The policy proposal pointed out that "if the Japanese 
Government leads efforts to increase Japan's imports, Japan 
would face unreasonable trade demands from the United States. If 
Japan failed to meet the numerical targets, it would run into 
U.S. sanctions." The policy proposal also pointed out: "If Japan 
rejects the U.S. demand for setting numerical targets, it would 
be highly praised for protecting free trade, an asset of the 
entire world." 
  Meanwhile, the policy proposal stressed that the Japanese 
Government should expand opportunities for foreign access to the 
Japanese market, and address price differentials between Japan 
and other nations by relaxing bureaucratic regulations and 
rigorously enforcing the Antimonopoly Law. The policy proposal 
also urged the Japanese Government to work out plans for their 
promotion and announce the plans at home and abroad.

Morning Edition] 
  [Text] Sozaburo Okamatsu, deputy vice minister of 
international trade and industry, in a news conference on 28 
January revealed the outline of a draft agreement presented by 
Japan at talks on the auto sector in the current round of 
Japan-U.S. economic consultations. The main points are 
proposals on the use import figures of finished automobiles by 
Japan as objective criteria, and an evaluation of import 
performance and discussion of remedial measures every six 
months. But Okamatsu admitted there remained a big gap in views 
between Japan and the United States, saying, "In the talks in 
Washington early this week I could not see any change in the 
U.S. demand for numerical targets, including future numbers." 
  The Japanese draft agreement proposes promoting cooperation 
among private companies, and using as objective criteria import 
figures for finished automobiles, the number of imported-auto 
dealers, and figures on U.S.-made auto parts bought by Japanese 
plants in the United States. 
  It proposes using as criteria only the numbers of actual 
purchases in the past, and not quantity or the future growth 
rate of automobile imports. 
  The draft also presents necessary future actions such as the 
sale of right-hand drive cars by U.S. companies and 
participation by U.S. parts makers in designing finished cars. 
It proposes conducting regular evaluation to determine progress 
in this area. Explaining the role of the government, Okamatsu 
said, "It will not go beyond providing support for business 
meetings and creating an atmosphere that encourages 
private-sector cooperation, such as through the provision of 
loans for the promotion of imports for instance."

26 January Evening Edition] 
  [Text] Washington, 25 Jan -- At a news conference on 25 
January, Takakazu Kuriyama, Japanese Ambassador to the United 
States, said: "Japan should urgently work out pump-priming 
measures, including a draft fiscal 1994 budget, to show its will 
to fulfill an economic responsibility." In this way, he 
stressed the need for Tokyo to compile the draft 1994 budget 
before the Japanese-U.S. summit talks take place on 11 February. 
Noting that Washington has put great expectations on Japan's 
pump-priming measures, a Japanese diplomatic source in the 
United States also said: "A delay in formulating 
economy-boosting measures is against Japan's interests. It also 
annoys people of the world." 
  During the news conference, Ambassador Kuriyama referred to 
the ongoing Japanese-U.S. framework trade talks in Washington. 
He said: "Both Japan and the United States should remember the 
starting point of the talks," expressing an apprehension over 
the situation in which Japanese and U.S. negotiators continue 
confronting each other over whether or not objective criteria 
should be set. He added: "Japan agreed last July to reduce its 
current account surplus and increase imports, and that was the 
starting point." His remark indicates that both Japan and the 
United States need to make concessions during the talks. 
  Regarding the prospect for the two sides making compromises, 
Kuriyama said: "Tokyo and Washington earlier agreed during 
construction talks to set criteria to gauge the openness of the 
Japanese construction market. This becomes a precedent and will 
be good for reference." In this way, he indicated that Japan 
would comply with the U.S. demand for setting criteria if they 
are yardsticks to evaluate results.

  [Text] On 29 January, Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], discussed 
with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa the issue of how to 
proceed with the deadlocked Japan-U.S. economic framework talks 
in the future, in consideration of the Japan-U.S. summit talks 
to be held on 11 February. 
  It is considered that regarding the macroeconomic policy as 
well as individual priority sectors, "a well-balanced accord 
will be indispensable" at the summit talks (as stated by a 
senior MITI official). Hosokawa and Kumagai seem to have 
confirmed the plan of working out a macroeconomic policy, about 
which the United States has expressed strong concern, which in 
turn may lead to overall success at the framework talks. 
  On the other hand, concerning individual sectors, Prime 
Minister Hosokawa and MITI Minister Kumagai have once again 
confirmed the stance of rejecting the U.S. demand for setting 
numerical targets.

  [Text] The contents of a new action program being drafted 
by the government to improve the government procurement system 
have been revealed. Key points in the draft program are that: 
1) open competitive bidding will be carried out in a more 
thorough manner; 2) initially, application of the open bidding 
will be expanded to projects of more than 500,000 SDR [special 
drawing rights] (from the current 1,000,000 SDR); 3) a 
comprehensive evaluation system which takes into consideration 
factors other than price will be introduced; and 4) a new 
complaint arbitration body to deal with overall government 
procurement will be inaugurated. 
  The government decided earlier on a plan to open up public 
works projects, and is now discussing procurement of 
communications equipment and medical equipment in Japan-U.S. 
economic consultations. The government wants to stress its 
position on market liberalization by presenting a comphrehensive 
action program which attaches importance to transparency and 
internationality even in government procurement in nonspecified 
sectors. 
  In a meeting of the Action Program Implementation Promotion 
Committee (chaired by Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura) on 27 
January, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa formally instructed 
Deputy Cabinet Secretary Nobuo Ishihara to prepare a new action 
program aimed at improving the government procurement system. 
The program is expected to be finalized by early February and 
to be announced at the Japan-U.S. summit meeting on 11 February. 
  While past plans aimed at improving the government 
procurement system have dwelled on such specific commodities and 
fields as supercomputers and public works projects, the new 
action program will apply in principle to all equipment, 
commodities, and services procured by the government. It is an 
action in recognition of criticism against "the 
bureaucrat-businessman colluded structure" that arose in the 
wake of the scandals involving general construction companies. 
  According to the draft, the new actiaon program first of all 
advocates thorough application of opening tenders. Under the 
Accounting Law, government procurements are supposed to be 
conducted through open bidding in principle, but they are mostly 
conducted by designated bidding or free contracts in actual 
practice. Given the circumstances, the draft restricts the 
cases wherein designated bidding and contracts ad libitum are 
allowed, and specifically note when they are allowed. The draft 
also proposes announcing the numbers and value of procurements 
have been conducted through opening bidding, designated bidding, 
and free contracts, and what part of them are from local sources 
and what part from foreign sources. 
  In addition, with regard to large value procurements which 
are required to be announced in advance, the value of the 
procurements for announcement will be lowered from the current 1 
million SDR TO 500,000 SDR. All concerned offices will be also 
required to hold seminars on their purchase plans at the same 
time. 
  While under the current bidding system, the lowest bidders 
are basically supposed to win, the new system will have an 
element of a comprehensive evaluating system. At present, such 
a system -- adding equipment performance to the price as a 
factor in deciding on winners -- is used in procuring 
supercomputers, but in the future the government wants to apply 
it to telecommunciations and medical equipment. 
  The new action program, in addition, proposes activating a 
neutral review committee (complaint arbitration committee) which 
will handle complaints on procurements on areas other than 
specific sectors like supercomputers. The program suggests 
empowering the committee with such rights as ordering the 
suspension of certain bidding processes.

  [Text] It has been revealed that a secret note was attached 
to an agreement Japan and the United States concluded in 1989 to 
expand the access of U.S.-made mobile and portable telephones to 
the Japanese market and that the two countries are at odds about 
the interpretation of the note. Japan wrote the note as a 
"preamble" which stipulates the spirit of the agreement. With 
regard to the interpretation of the phrase "equal market access" 
in the preamble, the United States has maintained that this 
phrase "assures the U.S.- system a share equal to the 
Japanese-system." Meanwhile, Japan has refuted the U.S. view, 
saying: "It only means that the U.S. system will also be given 
an opportunity for access to the Japanese market." The friction 
over mobile and cellular phones, which came to the fore again at 
the end of last year, has become complicated. 
  The outline of the 1989 Japan-U.S. agreement stated that new 
frequencies would be allocated to the U.S. Motorola-system 
apparatus so it could be used in the metropolitan and central 
areas of Japan. Following the agreement, Japan Mobile 
Communication Co. (IDO) has begun providing service via the 
Motorola-system in addition to its original service via the 
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) system. 
According to IDO, the Motorola system is characterized by 
relatively low charges for a telephone call. 
  However, due to the difference in the number of ground relay 
stations, the area available for service via the Motorola-system 
is smaller than for the NTT-system. That is why about 310,000 
units have subscribed to the NTT-system while only about 10,000 
units to the Motorola-system. The United States is dissatisfied 
with the figure. Threatening sanctions based on the U.S. 
commercial law, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative 
(USTR) began investigating the case last December, saying: 
"There is a possibility that Japan has not abided by the 1989 
agreement." The results of the investigation will be issued on 
15 February. 
  The very note was sent to [then] Deputy USTR Lin Williams 
[name as published] of the Bush administration by [then] 
Administrative Vice Minister of Posts and Telecommunications 
Yuzai Okuyama (currently president of DDI [Daini Denden 
Company]). According to a source concerned, there was the 
following clause in the note: "Measures included in the 
agreement should reflect the principles of MOSS (market-oriented 
sector selective) talks (which Japan and the United States 
concluded in 1986) such as transparency, home-country treatment, 
equal market access, and nondiscrimination against foreign 
companies." 
  It appears that on the basis of the phrase "equal market 
access" in the clause, the United States has asked the Ministry 
of Posts and Telecommunications "to instruct IDO to take 
measures such as increasing relay stations so that the 
Motorola-system will grow to the same level as the NTT-system." 
However, the ministry has rejected the U.S. request, saying 
this "is not an issue the government can touch." 
  In this connection, Mr. Okuyama says: "Although it is true 
that the note exists, I indicated the view in the note that 
Motorola-system mobile and portable telephones would be given an 
opportunity to access the Japanese market through allocation of 
new frequencies. I am sure that the United States consented to 
such an interpretation at that time. If, at present, the 
country maintains that the phrase assures the Motorola-system of 
an equal share with the NTT-system, that is regrettable."

  [Text] In the midst of worsening trade frictions and a 
stronger yen, Japanese businesses that have established 
"transplant" operations in the United States are having a 
noticeably hard time. Even Honda Motor Co., considered typical 
of one of the more successful operations, has been losing steam 
these days. While U.S. carmakers are enjoying a comeback, Honda 
hopes to regain its footing with its new model Accord. But even 
with the high yen, if Honda hopes to maintain its present work 
force at home, it will have to continue exporting some of its 
cars from Japan, thus putting restraints on its competitiveness 
and the "localization" of its products. 
  Along with the Civic, the new Accord, which came out 
yesterday (2 September [1993]), is one of the company's leading 
models and is important for the company, especially in the 
United States. There, of the 770,000 Honda cars sold in 1992, 
Accords accounted for 390,000 units, or one-half of all sales. 
Honda's goal is to sell 375,000 of the new model Accords in the 
United States on an annual basis, compared to 48,000 on the 
domestic market. 
  However, to beat the Big Three--General Motors Corp. (GM), 
Ford Motor Co., and Chrysler Corp.--will not be easy. U.S. cars 
are improving in quality and Japanese cars have lost their 
almost religious following. U.S. carmakers are also now on top 
in terms of having cut costs through restructuring, including 
wide personnel cutbacks. 
  At Honda, "costs have been cut at the source," according 
President Nobuhiko Kawamoto, and the company is now clearly 
taking a course that will give precedence to profits over market 
shares. The first step in that strategy is to further localize 
its operations. Thus, there were some 61 U.S. parts makers 
directly involved with the new model Accord this time from the 
development stage on. Two years ago, when the Civic was brought 
out, there were only 20 such companies. Honda has also raised 
its local sourcing from 75 percent to 82 percent. Compared to 
its 1993 models, 64 additional local companies are supplying 
parts, raising the total number of such supplies to 320 
companies. New locally supplied parts include suspension 
[frames], airbags, and sunroofs, for a total of 395 locally 
supplied parts. 
  Moreover, designers were sent out from as early as the 
planning stage to tour the facilities of Japanese-U.S. parts 
makers and recommend the use of existing plants to manufacture 
parts. When new cars are made, a large capital investment is 
required. But in the Accord's case, Honda was able to get by 
with "half the usual investment in plants and equipment," 
according to Kawamoto. 
  Ninety engineers from Honda of U.S. Manufacturing, Inc. 
(Ohio) were sent for three years to Honda's Saitama plant (in 
Sayama city). The idea behind this experiment, the first of its 
kind for Honda, was to have them learn how to reduce production 
costs from the company's central manufacturing base in Japan. 
  Armed with the knowledge it has gained about localization 
this time, Honda plans to expand local production even further. 
It is even studying the feasibility of shifting production to 
the United States of the Integra and Legend, which are now only 
exported from Japan. 
  As localization moves forward, an important question it 
brings with it is how to cope with the "hollowing out" of 
domestic industry. Last year, about 60,000 Accords were exported 
from Japan to the United States. Though less than 20 percent of 
all Accords sold in the United States, if these 60,000 cars 
were no longer produced in Japan, some 1,000 workers would 
become domestic dead weight. But the policy at Honda, says 
Kawamoto, is "to maintain its personnel." If cuts continue to be 
made in the production of its four-wheeled vehicles, Honda will 
have to do something about workers at its Suzuka plant. In lieu 
of personnel cuts, Honda has begun looking into the possibility 
of putting the Suzuka plant in charge of parts that are 
currently produced at both its Hamamatsu and Kumamoto facilities. 
  Revising its rate from 115 yen to 105 yen to the dollar, 
Kawamoto made it clear yesterday that the company is working on 
a new management plan. The age of the high yen is making it 
necessary for companies to consider fundamental changes in the 
way their domestic and overseas production and sales systems are 
being organized.

<F P=106> [Interview With Honda U.S. President Koichi Amemiya by New </F>
York correspondent Osamu Kobayashi; place and date not given: 
"Interview With U.S. Honda President--Local Procurement Rate 82 
Percent"] 
  [Text] [Osamu Kobayashi] The price hike on the new model 
Accord was smaller than expected.... 
  [Koichi Amemiya, president of U.S. Honda] Actually, we 
didn't want to raise our prices at all this fall. The minor 
increases that were announced in February and April were meant 
to dramatize an "Accord price freeze" for the new car year. But 
the yen rate suddenly shot up when we were at the final stage of 
setting prices. Because some of our cars are imported from 
Japan, we couldn't absorb the higher rate otherwise. 
  [Kobayashi] Why wasn't everything produced in the United 
States? 
  [Amemiya] We were ready to, for our part. But the problem 
was over on the Japan side. Personnel adjustments on their side 
haven't kept up with the speed that localization is taking place 
here in the United States. 
  [Kobayashi] I imagine you'll have to be concerned about the 
U.S. automobile industry accusing you of dumping if there are 
only minor price adjustments despite the higher yen. 
  [Amemiya] We locally sourced 82 percent of the parts for the 
Accord. And local production accounts for 80 percent. So there's 
no need for price increases to reflect the higher yen in its 
entirety. I can say with confidence that our prices are the 
result of our efforts to rationalize our operations. 
  [Kobayashi] Then, in terms of prices, will you be able to 
compete with U.S. cars? 
  [Amemiya] GM's fall increase was on a par with the Accord's, 
a 1.8 percent increase, but GM didn't raise its prices in the 
spring. So, all together, our increase is on or around the 4 
percent level. U.S. car makers also give a bigger mark down to 
their dealers. On the other hand, until now, people have been 
saying that with the same accessories, Japanese cars are $2,000 
higher than U.S. cars. With this new Accord, however, I think 
we've cut that difference down to $500. That's sufficient to 
make the Accord competitive. 
  [Kobayashi] Does it look as though you'll be able to regain 
your position in 1994 as having U.S. best-selling car? 
  [Amemiya] When we lost our top seating in 1992, there were 
people in Japan saying, "Given the trade friction between our 
two countries, that might have been for the best." But in the 
United States, winning is what counts. When we export the Accord 
to Asia, there, too, we're asked, "When is the Accord going to 
recapture first place?" Placing first in the United States is 
very important. 
  [Kobayashi] How about the business end...? 
  [Amemiya] What with a combined sales slump and start-up 
costs, 1993 was a very tough year for us. But the Accord should 
be contributing fully next year. We'll also be adding our own 
version of the Rodeo (recreational vehicle) to our battle lines. 
Higher priced imports like the Acura are having a tough time 
because of the stronger yen, but profit-wise, by the end of this 
term, we should be seeing the end to our present slump.

<F P=106> [Article by New York correspondent Osamu Kobayashi: "Fear of </F>
Hollowing Out Fetters"] 
  [Text] Whether in electronics or the automotive field, a 
common headache experienced in varying degrees by Japanese 
companies in the United States is the "tug of war" being played 
out with Japan over employment concerns at parent companies. "We 
feel threatened," complains a top executive for a Japanese 
electronics manufacturing affiliate in the United States, 
referring to a troubling question often put to them; namely, 
"what's going to happen to domestic industries if they are 
`hollowed out' [by the transfer of manufacturing capacity to 
overseas plants]?" 
  As of the end of 1991, direct investments in the United 
States by the Japanese manufacturing industry amounted to a 
book-value balance of $69.5 billion (or about 7 trillion yen at 
the yen's present exchange rate). But from the profit end, when 
revenues and expenditures are averaged out, that adds up to a 
deficit. One of the main reasons is that companies invested in 
personnel and equipment ahead of time on speculation of the 
yen's future increase in value and the extent of trade problems. 
  The importance of local production can't be measured in 
terms 
of cost alone. Common to the Honda Accord, Toyota's Camry and 
other Japanese cars that have been hits in the United States is 
the fact that, with their production localized from the 
development stage, they were made according to American tastes 
in automobiles. Just the fact alone that clear differences 
emerged in the tastes of U.S. and Japanese car buyers during 
the development process indicates the important results that 
localization can achieve. 
  In the home electronics industry, which has also pushed 
ahead 
with local production in the United States, a certain air of 
determination has become evident. American Matsushita 
Electronics (AMEC), which produces television cathode-ray tubes, 
has decided to source only 8 percent of its materials from Japan 
by 1995 (down from 20 percent in 1993). AMEC President Kazuya 
Ashizaki is quite clear in stating their plans. "Production in 
Japan will be limited to specialized, high value-added tubes, 
while more general-use tubes will be produced in the United 
States and Asia, where there's a consumer market for them." 
  There may be some resistance to shifting production overseas 
given the strong fear in Japan about losing domestic employment 
opportunities, but the key to global competitiveness may very 
well lie in reducing costs and expanding local production.

<F P=106> [From Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 25 January </F>
Morning Edition] 
  [Text] Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura has 
published a book entitled: "Japan, a Small But Brilliant Nation" 
[Chisaku Tomo Kirari to Hikaru Kuni Nippon]. As if reacting to 
the notion of a "normal nation" [futsu no kuni] advocated in 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa's 
book: "A Plan to Rebuild Japan" [Nihon Kaizo Keikaku], Takemura 
proposes building Japan into a country which is small, but has a 
unique identity. Takemura and Ozawa, who are rumored to 
conflict in the ruling coalition parties, have apparently shown 
their sense of rivalry even in their books. Takemura's book 
directly refutes Ozawa's ideas. For instance, while Ozawa 
advocates the participation of the Self-Defense Forces in UN 
operations to make active international contributions, Takemura 
writes: "I do not agree with such ideas." 
  While Takemura's aides stress: "This is not meant to clarify 
his relations with Mr. Ozawa," the book says: "When we cooperate 
with other political parties, the basis will be ideas on the 
Constitution, the future and image of Japan, international 
contributions...we would like to work hand in hand with 
political parties which share our ideas and will work with us 
toward a common goal." As Japan faces the second stage of the 
process of political realignment, there is bound to be more 
controversy between the two men.

<F P=106> [Article by Nick Rufford, Far East correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Japan has acquired all the parts necessary for a 
nuclear weapon and may even have built a bomb which requires 
only enriched plutonium for completion, according to a secret 
government report. 
  The Ministry of Defence has warned Downing Street that the 
crisis over North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes is 
threatening to force Japan to abandon its non-nuclear stance. 
The risks are detailed in a paper to the Joint Intelligence 
Committee, Whitehall's main security body, which advises the 
cabinet and the prime minister. 
  The report, sent last month, reveals that Japan has key 
bomb-making components, including plutonium and electronic 
triggers, and has the expertise to "go nuclear" very quickly. 
  One expert who has seen the report said: "They (the 
Japanese) 
could have acquired all the expertise for imploding a weapon 
without breaking safeguards. All they would need to do is 
select adequate amounts of plutonium for the core." 
  American intelligence officials said President Bill Clinton 
has given up hope of stopping North Korea getting nuclear 
weapons, a setback which is likely to spark a regional arms 
race. The Pyongyang government still refuses to allow full 
inspections of two disputed nuclear sites. 
  Tension increased last week when America announced it would 
deploy the Patriot antimissile system in South Korea. North 
Korea described the move as an "unpardonable grave military 
challenge." 
  The Patriots are supposed to help reassure South Korea and 
Japan by providing a first-line defence. But they will not 
prevent Japan developing a nuclear deterrent if it fears a 
surprise attack, intelligence sources said. 
  The turning point would come if North Korea improves the 
accuracy and range of its Nodong missile. The weapon, a version 
of the Iraqi Scud, can carry a nuclear or chemical payload; last 
May it landed a test flight in the Sea of Japan. 
  The Whitehall report emphasises there is no evidence yet 
that 
Japan has taken the decision to proceed with a nuclear bomb 
programme, or that it has strayed from its commitments to the 
international Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
  Japan has its own reprocessing plant for producing plutonium 
and has also contracted Britain and France to supply several 
tonnes of plutonium from Japanese spent reactor fuel. It also 
has sophisticated rockets for launching space satellites that 
could be converted to intermediate or long-range missiles. 
  Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, recently 
confirmed 
that he was "very strongly concerned" by North Korea's growing 
military strength. "The missile North Korea is developing has a 
range of 1,000 km and could hit much of Japan eight minutes 
after it is launched," he said. "How to develop a defence 
against that is a matter of great concern to Japan." 
  North Korea is growing increasingly unstable as food 
shortages and electricity blackouts blight the bankrupt nation. 
Kim Il-song, the 81-year-old dictator, warned in a new year 
address that any effort to pressure his country into reforms 
"may invite catastrophe." 
  The Central Intelligence Agency last week repeated its 
warning that North Korea probably had enough plutonium for one 
or two nuclear bombs. It also warned of its "heightened state 
of military readiness" and the deployment of rocket launchers 
and artillery close to the demilitarized zone. 
  America has threatened economic sanctions if North Korea 
fails to agree by February 22 to allow inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency. North Korea replied it 
would suspend the armistice on the Korean Peninsula if Clinton 
pushed for sanctions.

  [Text] On 23 January, the government decided firmly to 
resume grant aid to Myanmar [Burma], which is currently ruled by 
a military dictatorship. As for changes in the State Law and 
Order Restoration Council's (SLORC) policy on human rights, the 
government has judged that "because gradual improvements have 
been observed in the country's situation concerning human 
rights, this opportunity should be taken to seek a policy of 
dialogue" (as stated by a Foreign Ministry source). 
  Specifically, it is expected that a small-scale aid program 
in which 3 million-5 million yen will be extended in each 
instance to purchase medical equipment and drugs for hospitals 
will be implemented by the end of the current fiscal year. This 
is to be done through such nongovernment organizations (NGO) as 
the Burmese Red Cross and Doctors Without Borders. Ever since a 
military coup took place in Burma in 1988, Japan has as a rule 
suspended all new aid programs to that country, except for 
emergency humanitarian aid. 
  Starting in April 1992, when General Than Shwe became 
chairman of the SLORC, the Burmese military dictatorship has 
released political prisoners, ceased attacks against ethnic 
minorities, and lifted martial law. It has also permitted 
meetings between opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi (a Nobel 
Prize winner), who has been under house arrest, and her family. 
Such changes have thus been noted in the government's clampdown 
policy.

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry and the Labor Ministry jointly 
plan to increase their technical assistance to developing 
nations by sending technicians from the private sector. The 
ministries plan to review the current system of sending 
technicians from the private sector overseas -- the current 
technical assistance is applied to the field of shipbuilding and 
heavy electrical machinery -- to extend the scope of technical 
assistance to nonmanufacturing industries. At the same time, 
the ministries will ask companies through the Federation of 
Economic Organizations of Japan to use the revised system. The 
ministries believe that the system will not only enrich 
international contributions by the Japanese private sector but 
also enable companies -- which are promoting the restructuring 
of their organizations or downsizing their technical departments 
-- to send their technicians overseas. 
  The two ministries established the "skilled technicians" 
system in 1987 which was designed to send private enterprises' 
technicians to developing nations as technical advisers. The 
costs of sending them and a portion of their salaries are 
covered by the Japan International Cooperation Agency and the 
Employment Promotion Corporation. However, because of the 
bubble economy, private enterprises have not taken much interest 
in the system, and the number of companies which make use of the 
system has not increased so far. In fiscal year 1993, only 17 
companies applied to take advantage of the system. 
  In view of the fact that companies promoting the 
restructuring of their business systems are increasing, both the 
Foreign Ministry and the Labor Ministry have decided to make the 
system more helpful. The ministries also hope to send abroad at 
least 60 technicians annually. The ministries are considering 
sending survey missions to Vietnam, Indonesia, and China to 
learn what areas of technical assistance are needed.

<F P=106> [Article by Taro Yayama: "Rice Liberalization: `Heaven's </F>
Will'"] 
  [Text] The time limit for the Uruguay Round (new 
multilateral trade negotiations) is now imminent. The U.S. 
Government has to attain the new round's blanket passage by 15 
December under a term of negotiations it gained from the 
Congress, and so it is arranged that respective countries should 
show their acceptable conditions in each sector by 15 November. 
Among conditions are those related to Japan's rice issue, and 
Prime Minister Hosokawa must decide by that time whether Japan 
should accept "imposition of custom duties without exception" to 
replace all other trade barriers. 
  Dark clouds of regional economic blocs are hanging low over 
the world economy, partly affected by the worldwide recession. 
Amid such a development, making the new round successful amounts 
to opening a bright prospect in the world trade. It is 
undoubtedly Japan that will receive the largest benefits by the 
success of the new round. Prime Minister Hosokawa should 
consider it the highest national interest to carve out the 
future of the world trade by effecting a breakthrough on the 
rice question. There is no doubt that the rice issue is an 
extremely difficult question, but it is after all nothing but 
Japan's domestic problem. It should be defined as a matter of 
secondary importance, compared with the supreme national 
interest. 
  Seeing a prospect of hardship in the future of the new 
round, 
there was once a move in GATT to grope for a "small package" 
(small compromise). The move meant to avoid the difficult 
agricultural issue and settle things on a small scale. However, 
once such a move began, each country backed down on its 
concession plan, resulting in a widened move to only make 
smaller concessions. This resembles the way in which you make 
caramel candy. In making caramel, you should boil sugared water 
blended with baking soda, stirring the mixture with a stick. 
When it swells, the stick should be pulled out instantly and you 
will see caramel made in a flash. If you clumsily give too many 
small stirs, nothing will be produced and you will end in seeing 
only the sugared water remaining there. Sensing that there was 
such a knack at doing their business, respective countries came 
to realize that their negotiations would fail once they began 
moving toward the small package. They have thus generally agreed 
at present to work out a large package, that is, to produce the 
largest possible caramel. 
  The agricultural negotiations between the United States and 
the EC are now facing difficulty. The Miyazawa cabinet appeared 
to be looking forward to the failure of the U.S.-EC 
negotiations, with the view that, as a result of the failure, 
Japan would not be called to task for the new round's collapse 
and could avoid settlement of the rice issue. However, this was 
a totally mistaken view. No matter how the U.S.-EC negotiations 
turn out, Japan should manifest its acceptance of the imposition 
of custom duties to replace all other trade barriers. This may 
possibly soften the EC's position and link to successfully 
reaching a global agreement. Japan receives the highest benefits 
from free trade, and it should make sacrifices for the new round 
which perfects free trade rules. 
  Agricultural organizations and rice-related Diet members 
have 
made a do-or-die resistance to the imposition of custom duties 
under the following diagram: the imposition of custom duties = 
deregulation = the collapse of rice farming. Hikaru Matsunaga, 
former minister of international trade and industry, once said 
that "the logic that not even a grain of rice will be imported 
is not warrantable in the world" (January 1990). Reacting 
against his remarks, agricultural organizations adopted a 
resolution to the effect that "we seek his immediate 
resignation." Since then, the tendency to taboo the rice issue 
has taken root in the political world, and the issue has not 
been discussed at all, even in the Ministry of Agriculture, 
Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF]. This is strikingly similar to 
the condition of Japan during World War II when people who 
mentioned a cease-fire or the unfavorable progress of war were 
regarded as traitors. Japan was heading toward a catastrophe 
because there was no freedom of research and the press, was it 
not? What prospects do agricultural organizations, the MAFF, and 
rice-related Diet members have now regarding the rice issue? It 
is indeed irresponsible for them to only call for stubborn 
opposition without having any prospect, and it is not an action 
taken out of real consideration for the future of agriculture. 
<H5>  Farm Households Without Successors </H5>
  According to agricultural censuses, of every 14.9 farm 
households, only one household had a successor (a key male 
agricultural worker) in 1970; however, in 1991, showing a sharp 
decrease, one of every 78.7 farm households had its successor. 
This decrease in the number of households having successors will 
particularly be sharp in the upcoming five or six years. In 
those five or six years when people born during the first 10 
years of the Showa era are expected to retire, the decrease will 
be made in geometric progression. The lack of successors are 
particularly tense among rice farming houses. 
  Miyagi Prefecture, the home of the Sasanishiki rice strain, 
registered a ratio of one to 154 households in 1991 against the 
national average successor ratio of one to 78.7 households. When 
we compare this with the prefecture's 1990 ratio of one to 101.3 
households, we will see how sharply the number of the households 
with successors decreased. 
  Likewise, in Akita Prefecture, the home of the Akitakomachi 
rice strain, the 1990 ratio of one to 139.2 households changed 
to a ratio of one to 183.3 in 1991, and in Niigata Prefecture 
where the Koshihikari strain is produced, the 1990 ratio of one 
to 153.8 changed to a ratio of one to 251.8 in 1991, both 
indicating a sharp decrease. 
  If this trend goes unchecked, farmlands will be successively 
devastated and abandoned across the nation in the upcoming five 
or six years. Why does rice farming alone lack successors like 
this while there are enough of them in the domains of flower and 
plant cultivation, animal husbandry, chicken raising, and the 
growth of vegetables? The MAFF and agricultural organizations 
are not analyzing the reason for this and, in the first place, 
they even do not report to the people on this serious situation. 
  Young people shun rice farming because the rice industry is 
not profitable. It is said that, of profits accruing from the 
rice industry, 20 percent come from production, 30 percent from 
processing, and 50 percent from sales. It is only in this 20 
percent sector where farmers are now able to display their 
creativeness and ingenuity. This is because they are bound hand 
and foot by the Agricultural Land Act and the Staple Food 
Control Act. In contrast, agricultural cooperatives control the 
30 percent and 50 percent portions, skimming the cream of the 
top. Should the Staple Food Control Act be repealed, farmers can 
advance into the 30 percent and the 50 percent sectors. Then 
their managerial efforts will be rewarded, and they will become 
able to display their entrepreneurial spirit. 
  Present agricultural cooperatives exist not for the sake of 
farmers, but for their own benefits, and farmers are just like 
serfs working at government-run farms. Such being the case, it 
is natural for young people to shun rice farming. 
<H5>  What MAFF Should Do Is... </H5>
  What MAFF should do is think about how to release farmers 
from such inconveniences and restraints and make them enjoy the 
profitability of rice farming. It is none other than MAFF 
bureaucrats that fawn upon agricultural organizations and 
reckless commando-like rice-related Diet members and drive the 
rice industry to ruin. 
  Former GATT Director General Dunkel's proposal, which 
constitutes the base of negotiations in the new round, calls for 
1) importing 3-5 percent of minimum consumption requirements, 
and 2) lowering tariffs by 15 percent in seven years. As things 
stand now, our country already falls short of rice by 300,000 to 
500,000 tons for other purposes [rice for uses as other than 
principal food] even when there is not a crop failure, and so 
there will be no problem in accepting the proposal. As for 
tariff rates, they will be brought up for negotiations after our 
"acceptance of the imposition of custom duties" to replace all 
other trade barriers, and even though the imposition of custom 
duties is realized, foreign rice will not flow in with a rush 
when initially proposed high tariffs such as a 700 percent rate 
are approved. 
  Prime Minister Hosokawa, accept the imposition of custom 
duties to replace all other trade barriers with a firm resolve.

  [Text] As a part of the third supplementary budget for 
fiscal 1993, which will be drawn up after approving additional 
economic measures, the Finance Ministry has firmed up its plan 
to issue construction bonds as a revenue source to cover public 
works projects and other expenditures. Because of this, the 
total amount of government bonds for fiscal 1993 will reach the 
record high of some 16 trillion yen. Moreover, the reliance 
rate of the general account on national bonds will exceed 20 
percent for the first time in the past seven years or since 
fiscal 1986. 
  Expenditures in the third supplementary budget will be 
allocated mainly for public works projects, facilities and 
additional investments -- including Small Business Finance 
Corporation and the People's Finance Corporation -- which are 
accompanied by an increase in guidance policy financing. The 
amount of government bonds issued by the second supplementary 
budget reached 13.992 trillion yen. About 2 trillion yen will be 
added to that amount. 
  The Finance Ministry issued 14.172 trillion yen's worth of 
government bonds in fiscal 1980. It was the largest amount (of 
which about 7.2 trillion yen was for deficit-covering bonds) in 
the past. In fiscal 1993, the total amount of government bonds 
will exceed 14.172 trillion yen. Moreover, due to the decision 
to issue additional bonds, the general account's reliance rate 
on national bonds will be well over 20 percent. It will be the 
highest-level reliance rate since fiscal 1986, when the rate was 
21 percent. While the government promoted rehabilitation of 
public finance, the reliance rate was going down in the 
eighties. Although it dropped to 9.5 percent in fiscal 1991, 
however, the rate suddenly rose again.

  [Text] Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], indicated at a late-night news 
conference on 28 January that his party will agree to 
considerable revisions to the political reform bills that would 
bring them closer to the bills proposed by the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP]. The chairman made his decision so the 
party can avoid being isolated in the coalition alliance. It 
will be difficult for pro-reformist SDPJ members, not to mention 
those advocating taking cautious stance on reforming the 
electoral system, to accept easing the ban on corporate 
donations. However, Murayama judged: "The party could not gain 
the support of voters if it were to oppose the revisions at this 
time," since the bills were rejected at the upper house plenary 
session due to a considerable number of party dissidents who 
voted against them. But even if the party executives made such 
a decision, it is likely "there will be more than 10 dissidents 
opposed to the single-seat constituency system" (as stated by a 
senior party official). Thus, it seems inevitable the SDPJ will 
further lose its influence among the coalition parties, and 
Murayama and other party executives may inevitably have to 
resign. 
  At the news conference, Murayama said: "Since Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa and LDP President Yohei Kono have reached an 
agreement following lower house Speaker Takako Doi's proposal, 
the party will support this." "Regarding corporate donations, 
it is disappointing we inevitably had to accept the designation 
of one fund-raising body to receive such donations, but that 
cannot be helped from a general standpoint," he added, as he 
tried to hide his regret. Regarding his future course of 
action, Murayama said: "I plan to make a progress report at the 
party's general meeting of members of both houses of the Diet on 
29 January and also at the Central Executive Committee meeting 
which will eventually be held." He thus hinted he may resign 
after taking care of necessary matters in the aftermath. 
  The SDPJ seems to be holding itself together through a 
delicate balance between those advocating taking a cautious 
stance on reforming the electoral system and the pro-reformists. 
On such an understanding, Murayama sought for a way to avoid 
having to accept drastic concessions on the political reform 
bills that could cause the party to fall apart. At a meeting of 
senior party officials held inside the Diet building in the 
early hours of 28 January, Murayama indicated he wished to 
prevent Prime Minister Hosokawa and LDP President Kono from 
holding their top-level meeting which would likely lead to the 
coalition having to make considerable concessions to the LDP. 
As a "third alternative," Murayama hoped to settle the 
deadlocked situation by having the house speaker act as a 
mediator. In this way, he resorted to "asking help from Ms. Doi 
in times of trouble," although to no avail. The top-level 
meeting was held, and the coalition made considerable 
concessions, just as Murayama feared. 
  Only the "left half" of the SDPJ tried to prevent the 
coalition from having to make considerable concessions on the 
political reform bills. Party members in favor of reforming the 
electoral system were already prepared to accept the expected 
concessions, saying: "It is possible that discussion on 
revisions which could supersede the coalition proposal presented 
at the meeting of the joint committee of both houses of the Diet 
may be held at the top-level meeting" (as stated by SDPJ 
Secretary General Wataru Kubo). 
  Pro-reformists, led by a policy group called the 
"Democrats," 
have campaigned to collect signatures for a proposal to oust 
from the party those "dissident Diet members" who voted against 
the political reform bills at the recent upper house plenary 
session. They have thus put a check on Murayama, who has been 
supported by those advocating taking a cautious stance on the 
political reform bills. As of 28 January, the pro-reformists 
have obtained signatures from 35 lower house members and 32 
upper house members from the SDPJ, excluding cabinet ministers 
and Central Executive Committee members. Senior party officials 
belonging to the pro-reformist groups are confident of rallying 
together a majority, saying: "The proposal to oust dissident 
members and efforts to promote political reform are just the 
opposite sides of the same coin. Since our party is responsible 
for the bills being rejected at the upper house, it has no right 
to complain about revisions to key points of the bills. There 
also are many members who have not signed the proposal but 
support it. There may be only 20 opponents in the lower house 
at the most." 
  Under such circumstances, Murayama decided to accept the 
revisions. However, it is inevitable that the party's status 
among the coalition parties will now grow weaker.

  [Text] On the afternoon of 29 January, Japanese Trade 
Union Confederation [Rengo] chairman Akira Yamagishi held a news 
conference at Rengo headquarters. Following enactment of the 
political reform bills, Yamagishi noted the resignation of 
chairman Tomiichi Murayama and other executives of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is unnecessary. He said: "The 
responsibility (for the upper house's rejection of the bills) 
should be assumed by SDPJ rebels, but not the party leadership."

  [Text] The ruling coalition parties, at a meeting of their 
officials in charge of policy on 26 January, formally decided on 
the basic guidelines for formulating the draft fiscal 1994 
budget. These policy officials later met Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura at the prime minister's official residence, 
and requested that the government respect these basic guidelines 
in the process of drafting the budget. 
  With regard to the focal issue of income tax cuts, the 
guidelines deleted the wording in the orginal version that this 
should be done "basically without issuing special government 
bonds," and settled with the more abstract expression that "in 
order to bring about an early economic recovery, positive 
measures should be taken while paying attention to maintaining 
sound fiscal policies." A final decision on this issue will be 
left to the meeting of the ruling parties' representatives or of 
the economic affairs committee. 
  The basic guidelines reflect the political values of the 
coalition government, which puts forth the slogan of 
"responsible change," in its first effort to compile a budget. 
  Concrete policy measures cited as the main points of the 
draft budget include: 1) new agricultural policy in light of 
the agreement concluded at the GATT multilateral trade 
negotiations (the Uruguay Round); 2) the development of new 
sources of energy; and 3) fiscal and administrative reform 
measures, including the consolidation and rationalization of 
various subsidies, and relaxation of regulations.

  [Text] With the support of the coalition parties, the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], and other parties, the political 
reform bills, which have as their pillar the introduction of an 
electoral system combining single-seat constituencies with 
proportional representation, have been enacted. Following this 
development, moves toward further regrouping of political 
parties are now expected to take a complicated course. LDP 
President Yohei Kono has suddenly moved closer to Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa, as the former has started to clarify that he 
intends to cooperate with the Hosokawa administration regarding 
economic and diplomatic issues. Since Hosokawa plans to respond 
positively to Kono's advances, it is expected that the framework 
of the coalition government would be drastically altered should 
the LDP in fact provide the administration "support from outside 
the cabinet." The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], 
which is split over the issue of electoral reform, is facing a 
serious crisis. It is expected that drastic political changes, 
such as a restructuring of the coalition alliance due to a 
possible falling apart of the SDPJ, may inevitably occur in 
time. Prime Minister Hosokawa, who has strengthened the 
solidarity of his administration, plans to entrust the steering 
of the Diet to Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito. At 
the same time, he plans to give due consideration to the LDP. 
Thus, he will apparently take a "tandem" approach toward running 
the government. 
  At a 29 January joint press conference with Prime Minister 
Hosokawa, Kono said: "From the standpoint of protecting the 
livelihood of the people, I think we can make suggestions to the 
prime minister in terms of our knowledge, experience, and 
personnel." This was an outstanding stage performance by Kono 
that impressed the people with the "intimacy" of the two leaders 
since Hosokawa had already revealed that he plans to hold 
meetings with Kono again to exchange views on the Japan-U.S. 
summit meeting and on economic issues. 
  Asked for advice by the Prime Minister's Office on the issue 
of revising the political reform bills prior to the top-level 
meeting between Hosokawa and Kono, a senior LDP official 
belonging to the Miyazawa faction said: "Regarding political 
reform, all you have to do is throw a strike. What is important 
instead is to build a relationship of trust under which the 
leaders can mutually open up their hearts and hold discussions." 
This signaled that "Kono's LDP" is prepared to support the 
prime minister in view of the possibility that in the future, 
the SDPJ may break away from the coalition government over the 
issue of a consumption tax hike and other disputes. 
  Internal strife within the SDPJ over the political reform 
bills has shown further signs that the party may split. Party 
members who insist on preserving the party's independence may 
break away from the coalition, possibly turning the Hosokawa 
administration into a ruling minority. Hosokawa reportedly 
acknowledges that, sooner or later, the coalition must 
inevitably be reshuffled. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura hopes the LDP will split again so he can challenge 
Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa. He hopes to secure 
his influence in the administration by joining hands with LDP 
members who support electoral reform. Various speculative views 
intertwine around the issue of "regrouping" as a result of the 
splitting of the SDPJ as well as further splitting of the LDP. 
  Shinseito has aligned its sights on the next general 
election. It plans to gain political leadership straight out by 
forming a new party through such means as recruiting members 
from Komeito, the Japan New Party, and the SDPJ who support 
maintaining the coalition government. On 29 January, Shinseito 
leader Tsutomu Hata, who is deputy prime minister and 
concurrently foreign minister, held a press conference at the 
Diet building. Regarding the "Hosokawa-Kono partnership," Hata 
praised it, saying: "It means they plan to straightforwardly 
discuss the domestic and foreign issues that have accumulated." 
But, regarding its effect on the regrouping of political 
parties, Hata said: "It (regrouping of political parties) will 
happen through elections." 
  However, the fact that the political reform bills were 
rejected in the upper house plenary session due to a 
considerable number of SDPJ dissidents voting against the bills 
clearly indicates it will not be easy for both the ruling 
coalition parties and the LDP to gain a majority in the upper 
house. To promote regrouping of the political parties, it will 
become necessary to work out a framework which takes this 
situation in the upper house into consideration. Parties will 
have to reconstruct their original strategies which have been 
based on a "LDP versus non-LDP" concept.

<F P=106> [Article by Hikaru Tomita, economic reporter: "Emergency </F>
Economic Measures: Although Produced in Hosokawa Mode, 
Leadership Unchanged; Line-Up of Drafters Same as in LDP Era"] 
  [Text] With "give weight to consumers" as a 
catchphrase, "emergency economic measures" were announced on the 
16th--the fourth set of economic countermeasures since the 
collapse of the bubble economy. But there are already such 
criticisms as "the undiluted part is too meager and it will 
have no immediate effect," or "they have merely compiled 
measures not adopted heretofore." While "the premier's 
leadership" has been powerfully staged, aiming to bolster an 
economy nearly at rock bottom, only the moves of the ministries 
have been conspicuous; and a general comment is that a 
"bureaucratic odor" has been wafting about even more than in the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] era. 
  At a press conference following the cabinet meeting for 
deciding on countermeasures, Prime Minister Hosokawa explained 
the coalition government's first economic measures, by gesturing 
toward the panels nearby. From the prime minister's emphasizing 
that "since these are measures based on a consumers' position, 
they should definitely be effective," the earnest staging gave a 
sense of their trying to give the impression of the premier's 
leadership and the enthusiasm of a coalition government trying 
to stave off any further crumbling. 
  As though moved by the prime minister's zeal, officials in 
the Finance Ministry also had been hustling about for the past 
several days developing measures, saying "We will do as you, 
Prime Minister, instruct us" and watching television pictures in 
the ministry of Prime Minister Hosokawa giving press conferences 
here and there. 
  However, the Ministry of Finance for its part had not 
originally intended to add any new financial measures for the 
economy and had considered the present measures "adequate for 
distribution of marginal profits from the strong yen and for 
easing regulations." Just the middle of last month, a certain 
Budget Bureau official made light of the situation, saying 
"Sometimes it's nice to have a chilly summer. It's nice and 
cool." Yet, with a chilly summer coming on top of the strong 
yen, economic conditions have quickly turned darker. The fact of 
the matter is that even Finance Ministry bureaucrats have begun 
to change their expressions. 
  Then, Finance Ministry bureaucrats, who had been playing 
second fiddle, leaped onto "giving weight to consumers," which 
Prime Minister Hosokawa had put forward. They had racked their 
brains over the fact that "with public works already going full 
tilt, any add-ons would be useless; so then we might pull 
together providing welfare measures and cultural facilities." 
So, they came up with "improvement of social infrastructure on 1 
trillion yen scale," which is being called the sole undiluted 
part of the latest measures. 
  Although the prime minister's office had provided the ideas, 
in actuality they were measures shaped by the Finance Ministry's 
planning and staging. One economist said scathingly of them, "In 
short, they have merely pulled together a budget for items other 
than public works and called it giving weight to consumers. I 
cannot understand at all how, overall, it stimulates the economy 
to eliminate differences between roads and museums." 
  An aide of U.S. Treasury Under Secretary Summers, who 
arrived 
in Japan that same day, also was critical, saying, "It won't 
contribute to economic recovery or to expansion of domestic 
demand. I'm disappointed." 
  Yet, one can hear from a part of the Ministry of Finance the 
counter-argument that, "In the LDP era, the scale was loaded up 
in trillion yen units by the secret chamber negotiations of 
ruling party officials; but that kind of anachronistic bubble 
disposition is gone. We'd like that to get some credit." 
  On the other hand, as if putting "bureaucratic leadership" 
into practice, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] is elated that "it has turned out as we insisted." The 
"need for financial moves also among the economic measures" 
which MITI had called for since the summer has been chieved. It 
is also elated because of the land supervision system being 
eased, as MITI Minister Kumagai had earnestly hoped, even though 
it was worked in by indirect phrasing. A former MITI bureaucrat, 
too, the MITI minister "had the experience of being shouted at" 
as an underling of parliamentary vice minister Kumano. Hence, it 
is held that their relationship is not harmonious. But, he says, 
"We've become good friends" with this opportunity; and he 
chuckles endlessly at this unexpected by-product. 
  Yet, a National Land Agency official, who had opposed easing 
the land supervision system, says angrily, "I fear that land 
prices, which had finally settled down, will climb again. Does 
Mr. Kumagai understand the feelings of consumers?" This could be 
called an internal spat among officials; but its substance took 
a form long desired by the real estate industry; and while they 
speak of giving importance to consumers, that may be called the 
part where the risk of its being void of content bursts forth. 
  Unanimously, LDP officials now out of power offer 
criticisms: "To begin with, it was former Economic Planning 
Agency Director Funada, who yielded to the ruling coalition 
parties, made a rock-bottom proclamation, misreading the 
economy. Nevertheless, we cannot forgive such things as "taking 
measures because of the legacy of the former regime's defeat," 
and "Although the yen rose sharply from foreign investors taking 
advantage of us because the oalition regime is irresolute, it 
has no concrete measures against the strong yen." 
  While called a coalition regime, until just recently its 
major cabinet officers were all members of the LDP. It appears 
that the idea is circulating as an undercurrent in the LDP that 
just because they left the party "does not mean they can 
immediately bring out a sense of freshness." 
  On the other hand, from Finance Ministry bureaucrats who saw 
things go as they had wanted, one hears it said, "At first we 
worried a bit, but he's a pretty good prime minister, isn't he. 
He's quite easy to deal with." It seems all but unmistakable 
that, turned around, this "easy to deal with," means "easy to 
control."

  [Text] Policy Project Teams Reach Height of Activity 
  "Project teams" to "coordinate policies of the ruling 
coalition" are being established one after the other. During 
December, project teams began consultations on "Agriculture and 
Agricultural Community Projects" to discuss measures to be taken 
after the partial decontrol of rice markets, "Decentralization 
of Central Government Authority" and "Access to Information." 
Early next year, project teams will be initiated on a total of 
13 projects, to include "Residential and Land Issues" and 
"Improvement of Bidding Procedures for Public Works Projects." 
However, even though each project team arrives at a conclusion, 
they often encounter a situation in which difficulties are faced 
in reaching interparty agreements or an agreement cannot be 
reached on how to proceed with the discussions. 
  Project teams of the ruling coalition have been initiated 
and 
are managed with the motto that "zoku Diet members" will not be 
created. 
  The reason for this approach is the strong criticism 
directed 
at the adhesion between so-called "zoku Diet members"--wielding 
a strong influence over policy decisions by the ruling party 
during the Liberal Democratic Party days--and specific elements 
of industry. 
  Projects are initiated when an issue arises by summarizing 
the scope of the issue. In the past, project teams were 
established on topics such as "Cold-Weather Countermeasures" and 
"Relaxation of Crop Conversion Programs" to respond to poor rice 
harvests as well as "New Trunk Rail Lines" and "Annuities." Team 
positions are expressed in the form of "reports" which are 
submitted to the policy executive committees of supervising 
government agencies. 
  However, because the team in charge of the New Rail Trunk 
Line issue specified the name of the new line proposed for 
construction, the respective coalition parties were critical, 
and the discussions were returned to their initial starting 
point. 
  In the case of the team in charge of annuities, it was 
unable 
to engage in in-depth discussions because an interparty 
agreement could not be reached on how to conduct discussions on 
annuity reform, while treating central government treasury 
obligations and tax issues as separate issues. 
  Mamoru Nakajima, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Policy 
executive and chairman of the policy executive committee 
responsible for coordinating efforts of the project teams has 
said, "Although we are speaking of project teams that were 
established under the concept of banishing zoku Diet members, 
failure to brake the current trend will only result in the 
establishment of an unlimited number of project teams. It would 
be more efficient if the project teams were established on the 
basis of broader topic areas." Already, the potential has arisen 
for a return to "LDP-style" project teams.

Public Opinion Survey Section: "Agriculture-Faction Diet Members 
Driven Into a Tight Corner"] 
  [Text] The formation of a nonpartisan Diet-member league, 
which Diet members of the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ] and the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] who oppose opening 
the rice market had scheduled for 20 October, was put off 
suddenly in response to adverse reaction from Komeito, the 
Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and so on. The adverse 
reaction derived from a sense of alarm about "LDP-SDPJ 
cooperation," and although it is said to be the biggest urgent 
task to the Hosokawa government, it ended up exposing disarray 
within the coalition government parties. But what is attracting 
attention is the point that the question of opening the rice 
market is being discussed on the same level as the question of 
election system reform. 
<H5>  The Connection to Reform of the Election System </H5>
  A Komeito executive who was an active leader in smashing the 
Diet-member league said "the hardline faction opposing opening 
the rice market is apt to overlap the faction that is opposed to 
reform of the election system," and there has also arisen in 
some quarters speculation that "there may be a secret agreement 
between the LDP and the SDPJ on the question of opening the rice 
market and crushing reform of the election system." 
  To the Hosokawa cabinet, opening the rice market has become 
a 
big task, along with reform of the election system that would 
introduce in the lower house a system which combines single-seat 
electoral districts and proportional representation, and the 
problem of reducing income tax and increasing the consumption 
tax rate. Whichever one you take, it is a hurdle that could 
easily prove fatal to the cabinet, depending on how it is dealt 
with. 
  The opening of the rice market and election-system reform, 
in 
particular, have been spoken of as being linked, as in, for 
example, "it is a means for the conservative parties, which want 
to ease the problem of economic friction with the United States, 
to shift their base of support from the agriculture sector to 
the urban sector; former prime minister Nakasone's `86 system' 
can be ranked as something on the same line." 
  It has become clear that, in regard to the question of 
opening the rice market, which has become the focal point of the 
new multilateral trade negotiations (Uruguay Round), Japan and 
the United States have secretly reached agreement on a policy in 
which the Japanese Government would establish a six-year grace 
period and accept tariffication of rice. It is said that during 
the grace period there would be a course of Japan accepting 
minimum access (minimum volume of imports), and that the volume 
of imports would be adjusted between a minimum of 3 percent of 
domestic consumption to a maximum of 8 percent. 
  The Japanese Government is denying this. There is also a 
policy agreement of the coalition governing parties to the 
effect that "we oppose opening the rice market by 
tariffication," so it seems that they will not be able to shift 
all that easily, but it is certain that the question of opening 
the rice market is about to reach the crucial point. There is 
also the view that agreement will be reached between Japan and 
the United States in the not-too-distant future. 
  Concerning this plan to "accept tariffication of rice after 
six years," Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] leader Ichiro Ozawa 
said in mid-October, "It is probably not saying that Japan will 
tariff rice right away. It does not contradict to that extent 
the policy agreement among the coalition government parties; if 
the government explains it properly, the government parties may 
also be able to understand." 
  Even looking at the results of recent public opinion polls, 
opposition to opening the rice market has been declining 
gradually. According to a MAINICHI SHIMBUN poll, opposition to 
opening the rice market continues to decline, with 45 percent in 
December 1988, 36 percent in April 1990, 33 percent in December 
1990, and 27 percent in December 1991; conversely, opinion for 
partial opening has risen. The opinion for partial opening of 
the rice market is becoming a great ground swell. 
  The "League of Diet Members Opposed to Tariffication of 
Rice," which was centered on the LDP and the SDPJ, was created 
in response to this kind of movement and climate, with a nucleus 
of so-called rice Dietmen such as lower house member Shizuka 
Kamei in the LDP and lower house member Takeshi Takeuchi in the 
SDPJ. Komeito and others attacked at a meeting of the Board of 
Governors of the coalition government parties which was held 
immediately before the league was to be formed, because of their 
judgment that they did not want to leave live embers within the 
coalition government parties because of the problem of opening 
the rice market, and because there was a danger that opposition 
to tariffication of rice would link with opposition to a system 
that combined single-seat election districts with proportional 
representation, because the number of urban-sector Diet members 
would increase more than those of the agriculture sector if such 
a system were introduced. 
  At the time of the LDP's Toshiki Kaifu cabinet, agricultural 
organizations reacted against a system that combined single-seat 
election districts and proportional representation, saying that 
opening the rice market and a system that combined single-seat 
election districts with proportional representation would lead 
to neglecting and abandoning agriculture; it is related to this 
like the reverse side of a coin. As Professor Michitoshi 
Takabatake of Rikkyo University said at the time, "on this 
occasion financial circles calculated that it would be more 
desirable if a conservative government could be maintained, even 
if it reduced at one stroke the influence of the 
agriculture-sector Diet members and cut off from the LDP 
agriculture Diet members who are resolutely opposing opening the 
rice market, so it would not be at all strange if the core of 
the LDP thought so," a system which combines single-seat 
election districts with proportional representation has become a 
device that will increase the number of urban-sector Diet 
members much more than that of agriculture-sector Diet members. 
<H3>  The Agriculture Faction Will Be Ruined by Single-Seat 
Election Districts </H3>
  We investigated to see how the number of Diet members for 
the 
four large metropolitan areas (the nine urban and nonurban 
prefectures of Tokyo, Kanagawa, Chiba, Saitama, Aichi, Osaka, 
Kyoto, Hyogo, and Fukuoka) and for the other prefectures would 
change compared with the present because of the current 
government plan for a system that combines single-seat election 
districts and proportional representation. 
  In contrast to the fact that, for the current system of 
midsized election districts, the number of Diet members for the 
four large metropolitan areas is 203, 39.8 percent of all Diet 
members, if it became a system that combined single-seat 
election districts with proportional representation, their share 
of the single-seat election district portion (250) would be 180, 
43.2 percent of the whole. As to the remaining 250 seats of the 
proportional representation portion, executive committees have 
strong power in deciding on candidates, so it would probably be 
very difficult for candidates who represent the provinces or 
farm villages to run, so it is also conceivable that the number 
of Diet members who are supported by provinces and farm villages 
might decline still further. It would be an extreme case, but if 
all proportional representatives were to be Diet members who 
were not from the provinces or from farm villages, the number of 
Diet members for provinces and farm villages outside the four 
large metropolitan areas, who accounted for 60.2 percent under 
the current system of medium election districts, would decline 
drastically to 28.4 percent. 
  On the other hand, when we compare the proportion of the 
entire complement of Diet members under the current system for 
the 47 urban and nonurban prefectures, and which would be 
accounted for under the single-seat election districts of the 
government plan, there are 25 urban and nonurban prefectures in 
which the proportion of the complement would decline. In the 
Tohoku region the proportion would decline in every prefecture 
except Miyagi Prefecture. In the Chubu region, it is Yamanashi, 
Nagano, and Gifu. In the Shikoku region, it is every prefecture 
except Kagawa, and so on. Prefectures with a high proportion of 
agriculture are overwhelmingly numerous. Even judging from this, 
clearly the influence of Diet members who are supported by the 
provinces and farm villages would decline, and that of urban 
Diet members would rise. 
  The reorganization of political circles which made possible 
establishment of a non-LDP coalition government is about to move 
from Act I to Act II. All sorts of unions and alliances have 
been developed on the premise of introducing a system combining 
single-seat districts and proportional representation. 
  It will probably continue on to Act III and Act IV. It is 
judged that, in such a case, an "urban-type conservative party" 
will become a single cohesive entity. Shinseito and Komeito 
have, since early on, shown a posture of approving partial 
opening of the rice market. It seems likely that the non-LDP 
coalition government parties will select future development as, 
basically, an urban-type political party. 
  As might be expected, what attracts attention in this case 
is 
the SDPJ. As to whether it is indicating development as an 
"urban-type political party," such certainly not the case. As is 
shown by the fact that former Executive Committee chairperson 
Sadao Yamahana was the only one of that party elected by Tokyo 
in the July lower house election, in recent times the SDPJ has a 
strong tinge of a rural party. It is a political party whose 
actions are difficult to anticipate.

<F P=106> [Article by Kenichi Omae, leader of the Heisei Restoration </F>
Group: "The Japanese Public Is Hoping for Realization of 
`Consumer-Oriented Policy' Rather Than an Ichiro Ozawa-Type 
`Superpower Policy'"] 
  [Text] The Close Resemblance of Prime Minister 
Hosokawa and Yeltsin 
  Now, a great change has occurred in the world of politics. 
The Hosokawa cabinet has gained a support rate of 70-odd 
percent, the highest of any cabinet, and has the people's hopes 
centered on it. But reform is difficult in any country. 
  For example, the reform that Gorbachev carried out in the 
former Soviet Union also only destroyed the old system. It was, 
so to speak, merely the first act of the restoration. 
  Gorbachev tried to bring a market economy into the Soviet 
Union's centralized-type controlled economy by promoting 
perestroyka. That is, he caused change. But, although he 
destroyed, after that, he did not know how to build. When the 
moves of various forces, such as the military, began to be 
threatening, he attempted a unipolar concentration of authority. 
This time, Yeltsin is about to trod the same path. 
  In short, up to the destroying part, up to the part of 
causing change, it can be done with comparative ease in the 
information society of today. But putting the result in order 
and causing a safe landing is very difficult. 
  Even with the Berlin wall, destroying was easy. But causing 
East Germany to have as soft a landing as West Germany was too 
difficult, so even Chancellor Kohl fell from the zenith of his 
popularity to its nadir in a mere two years. 
  In the United States, with the word "change," Clinton 
defeated the Republican Party administration that had continued 
for 12 years. But, now, Americans are reacting by rejecting 
such things as the increased taxes and decreased government 
spending that accompany the change that Clinton is trying to 
carry out. The American people were fascinated by the word 
"change," but they are saying "no" to its content. 
  Then, what about the case of Japan? When it comes to whether 
the coalition government can cause the public to make a soft 
landing in a good direction, it is very doubtful. Because this 
government is not something that the public chose, something 
that received the mandate of the people; politically, too, it is 
the product of a common-law marriage. 
  Before the election, the Japanese people did not even know 
how the three new parties differed. They faced the election 
without even having been told such things as how Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party] and Sakigake [Harbinger] differ from the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], and whether or not the Japan New 
Party and Shinseito would join together after the election. 
  The result, as might be expected, was that the number-one 
party chosen by the people was the LDP, but after the election, 
a certain politician, who was the strongest, organized the 
present government with Hosokawa as a figurehead. 
  The Japanese people went along with Hosokawa because, first 
of all, this too, was certainly change. The slogan, From 
National Sovereignty to Consumer Sovereignty, that Hosokawa is 
setting forth (which the Heisei Restoration Group has advocated 
from the outset) is nothing other than the direction which 70 
percent of the Japanese people are now demanding. 
  However, when it comes to the question of whether the 
current 
government can move politics in accordance with this slogan, it 
is probably impossible. 
  The only one making a slogan of local autonomy and consumer 
sovereignty is Hosokawa; it is not a condition that binds the 
coalition government parties. The only tie is political reform, 
and that, too, only in connection with a single-seat 
constituency system. There are persons in the cabinet who still 
trumpet the doctrine of Japan, the superpower, there are also 
ones who advocate deficit-covering bonds, and ones who, even 
now, are still doing nothing but protecting industry circles. 
  The true state of coalition government party politics is 
that, just as up till now, it is consorting with bureaucrats, 
or, having been skillfully won over by bureaucrats, is doing 
things that have no relation to consumer sovereignty. 
  Should one ask why this kind of situation has come about, it 
is because the "test of loyalty" of the eight coalition factions 
has been established on maintenance of governing power, not 
debate on policy. 
  Moreover, persons who were members of perennial opposition 
parties have now begun to imbibe the sweet taste of being a 
governing party, and are spellbound by the fluent explanations 
of bureaucrats. A certain minister said with deep emotion: So 
this is what it was like to be in the governing party. 
<H5>  LDP Executives Appalled at Own Lack of Ability </H5>
  On the other hand, the LDP cannot even attack the 
excessively 
early deterioration of the coalition governing parties. It 
cannot set forth a single new plan. It lacks the ability. 
Because, in reality, LDP politicians had fallen into the malady 
of salaried workers of just going along, for the 38 years since 
1955, with a system called "LDP Inc." 
  Gathering money, creating ministers of state, and 
campaigning 
for election: everything is the LDP system. Individual 
politicians had only to go along with that system; up till now 
the ability of each individual had nothing to do with it. Even 
the LDP executives themselves are realizing for the first time, 
with disgust, the low level of their individual ability and 
skill. 
  Therefore, moves to waver and switch to other parties such 
as Shinseito have begun to appear because they think that they 
will not be able to do well in the next election if they have 
gone along with the current LDP. The fact that speculation that 
Michio Watanabe and Ichiro Ozawa will probably get together has 
been going around recently is also one of the phenomena which 
this meltdown has caused. 
  But even if they left the LDP, they are the kind of bunch 
who 
could not even become "manager of a business department;" so, 
even if one hoped that they could change Japan or so on, it is 
impossible. 
  I think there will be two options that Japan should take 
after this. The first is an Ichiro Ozawa type of centralized 
nationalism; the second is decentralized "consumer-oriented 
policy" [seikatsusha shugi], which we advocate, and which 
Hosokawa, too, stands on and is making his slogan. 
  There are already all sorts of moves around Ozawa. 
Meanwhile, 
there is also the movement of Diet members who say let us 
operate with consumer-oriented policy as the common ideology; on 
5 October [1993] those Diet members started the "Heisei Club." 
  Therefore, if one takes it that what transpired up to 
formation of the Hosokawa cabinet is the first act of a great 
reform, what happens after this will assuredly be the 
curtain-opening for the second act. 
  Japan is now entering the eve of a restoration. Regardless 
of whether they belong to the LDP or to another party, if they 
have the same policy, they will rebel with swords when the time 
comes. It matters not whether they become one party or two... 
The important thing is that those with the same view of Japan's 
future image win the power to govern. 
  It seems likely that politics will become more and more 
interesting from now on, but what can be said clearly is that 
the genuine great upheaval of the Heisei restoration will come 
after this.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ichiro Ozawa by Taiichiro Kobayashi, staff </F>
reporter; place, date not given: "Ichiro Ozawa Talks on Japan 
and Politics"] 
  [Text] Ichiro Ozawa is extremely logical and rational 
in his thinking. However, it is another thing if his thinking 
can gain easy acceptance with the climate of Nagata-cho and with 
Japanese society. He refers to a disparity between the views 
that one expresses officially and that one really holds at 
heart. 
  [Ozawa] I decided not to meet reporters on their evening and 
morning rounds. I have observed this policy since the general 
election in July, but there seems to be some misunderstanding in 
this regard. 
  At any rate, while making evening and morning rounds, 
political reporters thus far clung to politicians and walked on 
their heels to cover news. However, this kind of practice is 
meaningful only in Japanese-style politics, where it has been 
common for politicians to hold both official views and real 
views and choose to use either of them according to 
circumstances. They cannot express their real heartfelt views in 
public, but instead reveal them in places where there are only a 
few intimate reporters. Reporters hear the real views and use 
them as reference, but they do not report the portions 
mentioned off the record. 
  This is not just the case in politics, but also in the 
entire 
society of Japan. Citing a company for example, at a conference 
of directors, they talk only about official positions and wrap 
up the meeting quickly. They instead conduct varied talks on 
other occasons and shape up positions through backstage 
maneuvers. Politics is typical of this practice. 
  However, politics, economics, and daily life in Japan have 
now reached a point where they can no longer allow such a 
Japanese way of conduct and contrivances. One should clearly be 
allowed to express views and make decisions, but also accept 
one's own responsibility squarely. One should quit telling lies 
as a result of selectively using official or real views to suit 
the circumstances. By so doing, one has to get along well with 
others in the upcoming new era, particularly in international 
society. This is why I am saying that political reform is linked 
to reform of Japanese consciousness. 
  I do not tell things that should not be revealed, and I also 
do not selectively use real or official views according to 
circumstances. Therefore, it is meaningless for reporters to 
cling fast to me from morning till night. I quit the membership 
formula and instead decided to go public so that I will become 
accessible to anybody who visits me for an interview and so that 
I can talk about as many things as possible. 
  Abolition of the reporters' on-duty system arouses, in a 
sense, questions about the reason for the existence of the 
political desk. However, mass media were accustomed to such an 
old system, thereby saving politicians from showing their clear 
views on each separate issue. 
  For example, when Mr. Hosokawa was asked what was the 
difference between his government and the past Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] regime, he clearly answered that he 
will accept the responsibility if the political reform-related 
bills did not pass. In politics thus far, no one has clearly 
said that he will take the responsibility and quit should he 
fail to achieve this task. In a nutshell, no one has ever 
clarified where his own responsibility lies. Or, we may say that 
no one has ever been so self-assertive. 
  This is a tremendous change in politics. I was deeply 
impressed by the Mr. Hosokawa's attitude when he clarified where 
his responsibility lay, and I think that we did not err when we 
recommended him for his post. 
  [Kobayashi] In his book Blueprint for Building a New 
Japan, Mr. Ozawa is advocating the need to reform all 
political, economic, and social structures. What is it that has 
made Mr. Ozawa really feel Japan's crisis and driven him toward 
reform? 
  [Ozawa] It was the Lockheed scandal that made me think that 
Japan would go wrong if left as it was. I got a horrible shock 
emotionally. I have kept calling for system reform since I was 
first elected. When I saw my boss, who was so close to me, 
arrested, I was further prompted to consolidate my thoughts. I 
thought I had to do something. 
  I also entertained doubts about how the court of law should 
be. It is no good to grumble about the judicature because it is 
one of the three powers, but it, including the court, committed 
acts transcending the law during the investigation into the 
Lockheed scandal. Japan is a law-governed country, but the 
judicature committed acts which could not be allowed within the 
bounds of Japanese law. If things transcending the law are 
allowed because a case involves the prime minister's scandal, it 
means that the judicature can exercise its influence 
arbitrarily. I thought at that time that such a practice would 
really mislead democracy. For example, the other party 
implicated was questioned after being given immunity at a 
meeting of judges, and what was obtained from the questioning 
[in the United States] was used as evidence. There is no such 
rule in Japanese law. That was when Mr. Miki was governing. 
That way of politics in the style of Mr. Miki and such a way of 
administering justice made me think about many things. 
  [Kobayashi] In the Lockheed scandal, when asked by the Tokyo 
District Public Prosecutor's Office to interrogate those 
involved from the U.S. side, the U.S. Department of Justice 
sought their testimony after giving immunity from criminal 
charges. 
  Mr. Ozawa calls former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka father. 
In the Marubeni Route case of the scandal, in which this father 
was accused of accepting a bribe, Mr. Ozawa attended all of the 
191 public trial sessions from the first public hearing (27 
January 1977) to the first trial ruling (12 October 1983). Why 
did he need to attend them? 
  [Ozawa] That's what made me think about politics. Why did 
such a thing happen to my father? I suspected that the political 
mechanism itself might be the reason for it. 
  Politics really requires money. However, its mechanism fails 
to ensure the way to obtain money properly. It requires money, 
but it is quite difficult to obtain donations because there are 
such things as the Political Fund Control Law enacted in the 
name of principled policies. Accordingly, that created spots 
where money secretly flows in and out. After all, since 
people could not get necessary money, they seeked it secretly. 
Such was also the case with Mr. Kanemaru. 
  I doubted if, with all this, Japan's entire democratic 
system, including its politics, would still be all right. 
  Since then, I have kept thinking that if I ever come to 
the position where I can push for reform, I will act one way or 
another to that end. 
  [Kobayashi] The forces for defense of the Constitution are 
opposed to Mr. Ozawa, calling him "a nationalist" and taking 
issue with his strong arguments for the dispatch of the 
Self-Defense Forces to UN peacekeeping operations and with his 
position for a single-seat constituency system. What is Mr. 
Ozawa himself thinking about this? 
  [Ozawa] It is a totally absurd assertion that I have 
nationalistic thoughts, aim to build a superpower, or a 
minipower, and do not attach importance to the livelihood of 
ordinary working citizens. I would have to accept such a view if 
I were asserting that we, as a nation, should exercise more 
political or military influence on the world even at the cost of 
lowering the people's living standards and victimizing them. 
However, I am not saying such a thing at all. 
  Japan is enjoying an affluent, happy, and peaceful life. The 
people all wish to continue such a life for long. In other 
words, it is the role and goal of politicians to realize this 
wish. Therefore, the question is what we should do to this end. 
  During the Tokugawa era, when the people were living in 
isloation on the four islands of the Japanese archipelago, Japan 
had a population of 30 million and people still had a hard time 
feeding themselves. However, at present our 120 million people 
are enjoying an abundance of food. How has Japan, which is 
totally dependent on foreign countries in terms of resources and 
markets, been able to reach the present status? It is because it 
has been able to maintain friendly relations with various 
foreign countries and because the world has been peaceful. 
Conversely, Japan will have to lose all it has gained and return 
to the Tokugawa era if it cannot maintain cooperative relations 
with foreign countries; that is, if Japan gets isolated in the 
international community. 
  If people say such a situation is okay with them, that is 
another story, but as long as they wish to maintain affluence, 
happiness, and peace, they have to act in such a way that 
various foreign countries consider Japan as one of their fellow 
associates. This is my assertion. 
  Of all relations, the relations with the United States are 
the most important to Japan. Will relations keep moving for the 
better as they do now? Or will they move for the worse along a 
mistaken course in history? We are now at the crossroads in this 
regard. I believe that the situation is far more critical than 
others think. 
  The United States still exists as the number-one country, 
but 
its power has gradually been weakening in a relative sense. It 
is natural that the country make more demands as it gets 
weaker. After our defeat in the war, the United States protected 
Japan across the board. It afforded us generous assistance and 
furnished us with broad markets. It told us to make utmost 
efforts only in the economic field, promising that in other 
areas the United States would do all things for Japan. 
  Such a generous country as the United States has been 
weakening and making various demands. Not all of the demands 
are just, but it is now Japan's turn to cooperate. I think that 
we have to respond to these demands as best as we can as long 
as it is the precondition for Japan's existence that Japan gets 
along well with nations in the world and with the United States. 
  A certain expert said: Japan should straighten itself up in 
response while the United States is clamorously making various 
demands. It might soon stop making any demands at all. The 
time may come soon when it says to Japan, "Do as you like. You 
are no longer my associate and so I will make no request to you. 
Just live by yourself." 
  I shuddered and was seized with fear at his remarks. 
Fortunately, things may not be too serious yet because the 
country is still levying complaints against us; however, I think 
we have to take proper responsive measures before it is too late. 
  Last time, I said that the collapse of the LDP government 
and 
the Meiji Restoration bear a resemblance to each other. What 
symbolizes the black ships this time is the collapse of the cold 
war structure, is it not? The other party is still the United 
States. That is why I am warning so much. Our opposite number 
was the United States at the time of the black ships and at the 
time of the Pacific war as well. And this time again....

<F P=106> [Unatributed article in "People" column: "What About </F>
Development of the Investigation of Bribery by General 
Contractors? Stir Over `Firm Decision To Appoint Yusuke 
Yoshinaga as Public Prosecutor General'"] 
  [Text] The appointment of Yusuke Yoshinaga (61 years old), 
chief of the Tokyo High Public Prosecutor's Office, who is known 
as "Mr. Special Investigator," to the top prosecutorial post, 
public prosecutor general, on 10 December has been settled. 
Opinion is rife that the investigation of general contractors 
will gain momentum by the decision to make Yoshinaga public 
prosecutor general, but judging from established practice up 
till now, one can say that this appointment is an extreme 
exception. 
  As the chief prosecutor in the Lockheed scandal, Yoshinaga 
arrested and prosecuted former prime minister Kakuei Tanaka, and 
he later had a hand in the Douglas-Grumman scandal, the Recruit 
scandal, and so on. But in November 1991 he became chief of the 
Osaka High Public Prosecutor's Office, which was said to be "the 
highest post that he will reach," so it was thought "there will 
be no more times for Yoshinaga to appear on stage." But in July 
1993 he astonished everyone by being appointed chief of the 
Tokyo High Public Prosecutor's Office. 
  Moreover, after a mere five months he is succeeding to the 
top post during the term of Public Prosecutor General Yasutaka 
Okamura because Okamura abdicated his position. A person related 
to the Public Prosecutor's Office explains this promotion. 
  "The one who was controlling prosecutorial appointments up 
till now was Yasuchika Negoro, administrative vice minister for 
justice, and he was also scheduled to assume office as the next 
public prosecutor general. But confidence in him is at a low ebb 
because in the Sagawa Kyubin scandal he allowed the prosecution 
of Kanemaru to end with only summary legal proceedings. The fact 
is, the prime mover was Negoro, who has close ties with 
politicians. By this appointment, the chance for Negoro, who was 
born in the same year as Yoshinaga, 1932, to assume the office 
of public prosecutor general disappeared, and one can say that 
it severed the union of the judiciary and politics." 
  It appears that prosecutors actively engaged in prosecution 
gained further strength from this appointment; it is said "there 
are many prosecutors who would like to do something to enhance 
Yoshinaga's appointment as public prosecutor general. The 
investigation of general contractors is winding down; at present 
Kajima President Rokuro Ishikawa is the focal point, but the 
exposure of politicians is also being narrowed to two 
politicians and brought to a close" (a person connected with the 
District Public Prosecutor's Office). It is really very 
promising, but there is also a view which has misgivings about 
an appointment to public prosecutor general that is too early. 
Because a rumor that when Yoshinaga made a comeback to chief of 
the Tokyo High Prosecutor's Office there was a secret agreement 
between him and a powerful former public prosecutor general, is 
widely believed among those connected with prosecution. The 
secret agreement "was that the condition for becoming public 
prosecutor general was that Yoshinaga retire midway in his term 
and yield the post of public prosecutor general to Negoro. It is 
rumored that there even exists a signed and sealed memorandum. 
If that were true, it would mean that the highest post in 
prosecution, which should be the most open and aboveboard, is 
held in rotation by the same group by private agreement" (person 
connected with the Tokyo High Public Prosecutor's Office). 
  Attorney Kazuo Kawakami, former chief of the Special 
Investigations Department of the District Public Prosecutor's 
Office says this: 
  "Speaking from Yoshinaga's real ability, I think it was a 
natural appointment. I would like him to hunt down great evil 
for the full extent of his term, without being led astray by 
such things as disputes over appointments." 
  There are signs that early this month the investigation of 
general contractors will finally begin to move toward central 
political circles. We also desire a thorough investigation in 
order to negate the rumors of a secret agreement.

<F P=106> [Article by KANKAI editorial staff] </F>
  [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is now 
being buffeted by tumult from at home and abroad. 
Internationally, along with the end to the East-West Cold War, 
the building of a new international order is becoming a pressing 
issue. At home, the 1955 order centering on both the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) and the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
(SDPJ) has ended and an effective method is being sought to 
proceed with foreign policy under a ruling coalition composed of 
eight parties. The following is an introduction to the officials 
that are proceeding with Japanese foreign policy under the most 
difficult set of circumstances since the war. 
<H5>  Minister and Parliamentary Vice Minister </H5>
  On 1 August, MOFA carried out its greatest structural reform 
since the war. The two pillars of structural reform were the 
abolition of the United Nations Bureau along with the 
establishment of the General Foreign Affairs Policy Bureau and a 
change of the mantle for the Information Analysis, Research, and 
Planning Bureau into the International Information Bureau. Along 
with this, personnel changes were carried out on a ministry-wide 
scale for the most part, including those overseas. 
  Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs 
Tsutomu Hata is leading MOFA in this difficult situation. As the 
head of the Shinseito Party, he contributed to the victory of 
the non-LDP forces in the general election and the establishment 
of a coalition administration centering on Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa. He personally denies it, but according to 
those around him, it is said that he desired the appointment to 
foreign minister at an early date and ultimately fulfilled his 
desire. 
  He presents a slightly different foreign policy ideology 
from 
that of foreign ministers of the LDP regime era. For instance, 
he advocates expressing general responsibility for World War II 
and refraining from visits to Yasukuni Shrine on the 15 August 
anniversary of the end of the war. 
  The parliamentary vice minister for foreign affairs, who 
assists the foreign minister, is Shozo Azuma of the Komeito. It 
is said that the appointment of the parliamentary vice minister 
for foreign affairs from the Komeito was due to the strong 
desire by that party and the desire was realized with the 
appointment of Azuma. Ironically, his electoral district is the 
Tokyo No. 6 District, the same area as former parliamentary vice 
minister for foreign affairs, Koji Kakizawa, and it can be 
called a personnel change due to an awareness of activities in 
the era of Parliamentary Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs 
Kakizawa. 
<H3>  Administrative Vice Minister, Deputy Vice Minister for 
Foreign Affairs, and Chief of Protocol </H3>
  Supporting the two politicians, Tsutomu Hata and Shozo 
Azuma, 
are Administrative Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Kunihiko 
Saito (passed foreign service exam in 1957, same for below) and 
the following foreign service officers: 
  Saito, the administrative vice minister following previous 
Vice Minister Hisashi Owada, has superior ability that was noted 
early on in his career. He normally followed after Owada and 
studied his foreign policy methods, as he was councilor for the 
Treaties Bureau when Owada was director of that bureau and was 
deputy vice minister for foreign affairs (in charge of political 
affairs) when Owada was administrative vice minister for foreign 
affairs. 
  However, Saito's foreign policy methods are a contrast to 
Owada's. For example, Owada diligently looked over documents 
himself and corrected them in ink in small letters. As opposed 
to Owada who was not satisfied unless he participated in 
everything himself, Saito is a rare type among recent senior 
officials,who " leaves the work to subordinates but takes the 
responsibility upon himself." 
  Naturally, Saito is popular among subordinates. In his days 
as director of the Treaties Bureau, once Diet deliberations had 
stopped as a result of his replies and when the evening came, he 
left the office promptly. As might be expected, his subordiantes 
were flustered at that. It is a fact that the sense of tension 
in the ministry in the Owada era has dissolved with the 
appointment of Saito, and the atmosphere has become animated. 
  There is obviously a lot of anxiety under a composite 
administration, but he does not seem perturbed, saying "The 
continuation of foreign policy is included in the consensus of 
the eight parties, and I am not worried at all. I am confident 
that policy decisions will be made so as not to lose 
opportunities." 
  Following No. 1 Saito on the administrative side are the two 
No. 2 deputy vice ministers for foreign affairs, Hiroshi Fukuda 
(1959) and Koichiro Matsuura (1958). Fukuda is in charge of 
political affairs, and Matsuura is in charge of economic 
affairs. These two are called "vice minister class." 
  After serving as private secretary to Prime Minister 
Yasuhiro 
Nakasone (at the time) and director of the Treaties Bureau, 
Fukuda served abroad as ambassador to Malaysia for about two 
years and nine months. 
  The major jobs for the deputy vice minister for foreign 
affairs in charge of political affairs are consulting with the 
vice minister class of major countries and preparing discussions 
on political issues at summits. His schedule is rather hard and 
among senior councilors, for example, some are forced to retire 
from overwork due to consecutive trips abroad. 
  Experience as a private secretary to the prime minister and 
director of the Treaties Bureau is useful in the administrative 
work of a deputy vice minister for foreign affairs, but 
nevertheless, a hiatus of two years and nine months is big. 
Therefore, he currently is receiving discourses on each topic 
from administrative authorities. For the present, it seems that 
preparations for the Japan visit by Russian President Yeltsin, 
scheduled for the middle of October, will be the test case. 
  Matsuura scored further points by shepherding the success of 
the Tokyo Summit in July. After enjoying hiking in the Northern 
and Southern Alps on a brief summer vacation, he will undertake 
U.S.-Japancomprehensive economic talks from September on. With 
this as his final job, he will be transferred to an 
ambassadorship in the European area at the end of 1993 or the 
beginning of 1994. 
  The chief of protocol, Junichi Nakamura (1957), also will be 
transferred to an ambassadorship after the Europe visit of the 
emperor and empress in September. It has been informally decided 
that his successor will be Makoto Watanabe (1958), director of 
the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). 
  The private secretary to the minister of foreign affairs is 
Yoichi Nishizawa, who is young, but enjoys confidence of Hata.. 
Lately, there is the trend in MOFA for the minister's secretary 
for political affairs to become the private secretary to the 
minister of foreign affairs. 
  Kaoru Ishikawa (1971) substantially serves as private 
secretary in handling the private secretary administrative work 
of the foreign minister. He was appointed from the position of 
chief of the First West Europe Division, and there had been a 
move for his appointment in the era of the previous Foreign 
Minister Kabun Muto. However, just when he had begun making his 
rounds of greetings, the former appointee was retained in his 
post by the voice of authority of former Foreign Minister Michio 
Watanabe. He was thoroughly prepared for his appearance this 
time. He is a second-generation foreign service officer 
following his father who served as ambassador to Kuwait. He 
resembles his father in both spoken and written eloquence. 
  Another person who handles the private secretary 
administrative work of the foreign minister is Kazuhiro Fujimura 
(1982), a young foreign service hopeful with a promising future. 
  Next, let's look at the new major foreign affairs lineup 
after the August personnel changes by bureau. 
<H5>  Minister's Secretariat </H5>
  The director of the Secretariat is Sadayuki Hayashi (1959). 
He had the strong trust of the previous vice minister, Owada, 
and will be promoted to deputy vice minister for foreign affairs 
in charge of economic affairs, the successor to Matsuura, at the 
end of 1993 or the beginning of 1994. It is said to be "a 
parting present personnel change" by Owada. Since he has a 
sincere personality and is the type who carries out instructions 
silently, he is highly rated by superiors. 
  Saito also cited "Hayashi's remaining in his post for at 
least a half year" as a condition for accepting the vice 
ministership. 
  The press secretary, who is the spokesman for MOFA, is 
Kisuke 
Terada (1961). He was appointed from the position of director of 
the Central and South American Affairs Bureau, and because of 
his experience as private secretary to Prime Minister Noboru 
Takeshita, chief of the Press Division, and councilor in charge 
of the press and public relations, he has many acquaintances 
among the press-related people at home and abroad. He is perhaps 
the most suitable person for the position. 
  His ambition is modestly "not to have misreadings by 
press-related people," but he knows the vital points of the job. 
  Incidentally, Terada is an expert in Spanish. He even has 
the ability to serve as an interpreter for heads of state 
conferences. Moreover, he is also skillful respectively in 
English, which every foreign service officer can speak, and in 
French due to his wife's being French. The press secretary for 
foreign affairs has a news conference with foreign special 
correspondents in Tokyo twice a week in the news conference room 
on the third floor of MOFA, and the birth of a press secretary 
proficient in languages has been favorably received by foreign 
reporters. 
  The general councilor in charge of the Diet is Atsushi 
Hatanaka (1964). It seems that there is considerable confusion 
on Diet measures because the LDP has become an opposition 
party, a "strong opposition party" has appeared, the ruling 
party is a coalition of eight parties, and the SDPJ, which had 
been far from the government foreign affairs, security, and 
defense policies up to now, has become a party in power. 
  The councilor in charge of the press and public relations is 
Sadaaki Numata (1965). He is an expert in English and previously 
served as an interpreter at U.S.-Japan summit conferences. Like 
Terada, foreign special correspondents in Tokyo have come to 
rely on him. 
  The chiefs of the major divisions in the Minister's 
Secretariat are Rokuzen Nishimura (1966), chief of the General 
Affairs Division; Shotaro Taniuchi (1968), chief of the 
Personnel Division; and Ichiro Fujisaki (1968), chief of the 
Financial Affairs Division. 
  Among them, Nishimura is a foreign service officer who 
joined 
MOFA from Sophia University and was appointed chief of the 
General Affairs Division after serving as chief of the Press 
Division and counselor for the Information Analysis, Research, 
and Planning Bureau. At MOFA, the chief of the General Affairs 
Division, Minister's Secretariat, is a "pivotal" post in charge 
of coordination with the prime minister's official residence and 
the various ministries and agencies. There will be many 
instances when he is appointed to a bureau director position in 
the future. 
  In his days as counselor for the Information Analysis, 
Research, and Planning Bureau, Nishimura achieved results by 
undertaking, without sleep or rest, the problem of fund 
cooperation ($13 billion) for realizing peace and security in 
the Gulf region. Japan went so far as to increase taxes to 
implement the fund. He has become the personal adviser on 
foreign affairs for the prime minister due to school ties with 
Prime Minister Hosokawa. 
  It has been a characteristic of Nishimura that in 
undertaking 
foreign policy problems, he has tried to make a fresh approach 
that is different from ordinary foreign service officers' 
approaches. 
  Insofar as Taniuchi served as a private secretary in the 
days 
when Nobuo Matsunaga was administrative vice minister for 
foreign affairs, he is an affable person and also does his work 
well. Having passed the foreign service test in 1968, he 
probably is a future candidate for vice minister, along with 
Hitoshi Tanaka mentioned later (chief of the General Affairs 
Division, General Foreign Policy Bureau). 
  Fujisaki is the son of Kazusato Fujisaki, former director of 
the MOFA Treaties Bureau, who served as a supreme court justice. 
There are many second-generation foreign service officers within 
MOFA. 
  Chikahito Harada (1973), who became chief of the Press 
Division in the August personnel changes, was a selection that 
upset the expectations of many people. Previously, a senior 
foreign service officer of the division chief class has been 
appointed the chief of the Press Division. Since Harada, the 
youngest of the division chiefs, was appointed, those within 
MOFA were surprised. 
  Before returning as chief of the Status of U.S. Forces 
Agreement Division of the North American Affairs Bureau at the 
MOFA, Harada served as secretary in charge of public relations 
at the Japanese Embassy in Russia and was popular among the 
Japanese press corp in Moscow. 
  In his days as chief of the Status of U.S. Forces Agreement 
Division, he sought understanding and cooperation in the 
maintenance of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty while exchanging 
drinks with the mayors of cities, towns, and villages embracing 
U.S. military bases throughout Japan. He was familiar with "the 
scene,"a rare attribute for a foreign service officer. This 
record of performance was seen in his appointment to chief of 
the Press Division, which taxes one's nerves due to the 
association with press-related people. 
  Harada's language of expertise is Russian. The Japan visit 
of 
President Yeltsin in October probably will be the first 
opportunity to show his skill. 
<H5>  General Foreign Policy Bureau </H5>
  The August structural reform was inaugurated with a flourish 
of trumpets. MOFA has been a vertical administration with the 
Asian Affairs Bureau, North American Affairs Bureau, and 
European and Oceanic Affairs Bureau, but the reason this bureau 
has been established is to deal with international situations 
that are rife with fluidity, by developing horizontal, 
comprehensive foreign policy. 
  Behind this is the reflection that vertical administration 
was a disaster and a swift response was impossible at the time 
of the 1990 Gulf war. 
  The first director of the bureau is Shunji Yanai (1960), who 
served as the first director general of the International Peace 
Cooperation Headquarters in the era of the previous Miyazawa 
administration. This bureau created the draft of the foreign 
policy portion of the general policy speech delivered by Prime 
Minister Hosokawa in the special session of the Diet. This 
bureau also was in charge of the policy of taking general 
responsibility for World War II that has been advocated by 
Foreign Minister Hata. Furthermore, this bureau has begun to 
make the draft for Prime Minister Hosokawa's general discussion 
speech at the ordinary general session of the United Nations. 
  Novel ideas, in addition to ample knowledge of internationl 
law, are sought in the officers of the bureau, but the best 
fitted was Yanai who served as director of the Treaties Bureau 
and was concerned with the first full-scale UN peacekeeping 
operation [PKO] for Japan. 
  Yanai looks back on his year as director general of the 
International Peace Cooperation Headquarters as "having 
continuous application to everday problems." His hobby is being 
a Sunday carpenter and he apparently makes furniture. 
  Councilor Yoshikazu Nogami (1965) was known internationally 
for his activities in the multinational conference on peace in 
the Middle East during his previous job when he was councilor 
for the Middle Eastern and African Affairs Bureau. He is viewed 
as a talent most appropriately appointed to the General Foreign 
Policy Bureau (at MOFA abbreviated and called Soseikyoku) where 
new ideas are needed. 
  The major division chiefs are the aforementioned Hitoshi 
Tanaka (1968), chief of the General Affairs Division; Yoichi 
Otabe (1973), chief of the Planning Division; Sumio Tarui 
(1970), chief of the Security Policy Division; and Mototake 
Yoshikawa (1973), chief of the UN Policy Division. 
  Tanaka is "an able man" who served in the past as the senior 
administrative official of the First North America Division and 
chief of the Second North America Division. There is the feeling 
that MOFA heads chose talented men such as Yanai, Nogami, and 
Tanaka to produce results in this new bureau. 
<H5>  Asian Affairs Bureau </H5>
  It was traditionally the most rightwing bureau before the 
inauguration of the General Foreign Policy Bureau, but it has 
yielded that position with the birth of the General Foreign 
Policy Bureau. 
  The bureau director is Tadashi Ikeda (1961), an expert on 
China. Since the time of his appointment, it has been said that 
he was appointed so that the historical visit to China by the 
emperor and empress could end successfully. The China visit of 
both their majesties ended without incident as expected and his 
popularity within MOFA quickly rose. Some call for him to be the 
next director of the Secretariat disregarding Yukio Sato, 
director of the North American Affairs Bureau, who is highly 
recommended by some to be the next director of the Secretariat. 
  During his days as a minister in Thailand, he had contacts 
with officers of the Pol Pot faction in the jungle near the 
Cambodian border. He has increased his fans in MOFA by his 
sincere courtesy without the unapproachableness that is apt to 
exist in foreign service officers. 
  The councilor is Yukio Takeuchi (1966) who served as private 
secretary to Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa (at the time). The 
counselor is Akimoto Takano (1966) who served in the handling 
of the private secretary administrative work for Foreign 
Minister Shintaro Abe (at the time, now deceased). 
  The division chiefs are Seiji Kojima (1971), chief of the 
Regional Policy Division; Shigeru Nakamura (1972), chief of the 
Northeast Asia Division; Yoshio Nomoto (1971), chief of the 
China Division; Tadamichi Yamamoto (1973), chief of the First 
Southeast Asia Division; Keiichi Hayashi (1973), chief of the 
Second Southeast Asia Division; and Yasuaki Tanizaki (1974), 
chief of the Southwest Asia Division. 
  Among these, Nomoto was appointed from his position as chief 
of the General Affairs Department (Taipei) of the Exchange 
Association with Taiwan. In the previous MOFA personnel changes, 
it would not have been considered because of concern for China, 
and it can be called a sign that Japan's foreign policy on China 
has changed from "outward formality" to "inward feelings." 
  Yamamoto's outstanding English capability and superior 
diplomatic abilities that were demonstrated in the series of 
Cambodian problems have received a high rating inside and 
outside MOFA. 
<H5>  North American Affairs Bureau </H5>
  The bureau director is Yukio Sato (1960), the ablest man in 
MOFA. The prospects are that he will be promoted to director of 
the Secretariat at the end of 1993 or the beginning of 1994. 
  At MOFA, the Economic Affairs Bureau stands at the front 
line 
in the economic area of U.S.-Japan relations, but Sato directed 
talk preparations for the opening of the first talks between the 
U.S. and Japanese heads of state for the Hosokawa administration 
in New York in the latter part of September. 
  The councilor is Ryozo Kato (1964), and the chiefs of the 
major divisions are Toshiaki Ozawa (1972), chief of the First 
North America Division, and Shinichi Nishimiya (1975), chief of 
the Second North America Division. Kato is a future candidate 
for vice minister. 
<H5>  Central and South American Affairs Bureau </H5>
  The bureau director is Kiyohiko Arafune (1961), who was 
called back from his position as ambassador to Nicaragua to 
replace Terada, who became press secretary. He has had a broad 
range of work and friendly relationships, being temporarily 
transferred to the Finance Ministry and serving as head of the 
Nagoya Customshouse, and it seems to have become a plus in his 
career as a foreign service officer afterward. 
  The counselor is Shinya Nagai (1967), and the chiefs of the 
major divisions are Akira Miwa (1974), chief of the First 
Central and South America Division which covers South America, 
and Masuo Nishibayashi (1974), chief of the Second Central and 
South America Division which is in charge of Central America and 
part of South America. 
<H5>  European and Oceanic Affairs Bureau </H5>
  The bureau director is Issei Nomura (1962), an expert on 
Russia. It seems his ability will be evaluated by whether or 
not he will be able to make the official visit to Japan by 
Russian President Yeltsin in the middle of October the first 
step in the resolution of the pending northern territories 
problem. 
  The councilor is Shigeru Tsumori (1964), and a major 
division 
chief is Tsuneo Nishida (1969) who transferred to the Russian 
Division from chief of the Press Division. Nishida is an expert 
in English and it is unusual to appoint a chief of the Russian 
Division who does not speak Russian. There is a strong view that 
it is an expression of MOFA's desire to handle foreign policy on 
Russia using a new concept. 
  Yasuo Saito (1970), who handled private secretary 
administrative work for the previous foreign minister, is the 
chief of the First West Europe Division which is in charge of 
France and Germany, etc., and Akitaka Saiki (1975) is the chief 
of the Second West Europe Division which is in charge of Great 
Britain, etc. Saiki is known as a "forceful foreign service 
officer." 
<H5>  Middle Eastern and African Affairs Bureau </H5>
  The bureau director is Takaya Sudo (1961), an Arabist. 
Although he was appointed after serving as councilor for science 
and technology, he should be quite satisfied with the 
appointment as an expert. For the time being, the big job will 
be preparations for the "Africa Development Conference" to be 
held under the sponsorship of the Japanese Government in Tokyo 
in October. 
  The counselor is Toshinori Shigeie (1968) who returned to 
the 
home ministry after serving as a minister to the United 
Nations. The chiefs of the divisions are Hideo Tanaka (1970), 
chief of the First Middle East Division which has jurisdiction 
over Egypt and Israel, etc.; Toshihiro Okuda (1974), chief of 
the Second Middle East Division which is in charge of the Gulf 
nations such as Saudi Arabia; Kensuke Tsuzuki (1974), chief of 
the First Africa Division; and Hisao Yamaguchi (1974), chief of 
the Second Africa Division. 
  Shigeie, who has had experience as chief of the Security 
Division, North American Affairs Bureau, etc., is greatly 
trusted by high-ranking officials, but it seems that his actions 
will be the key to deciding the value of the bureau. 
<H5>  Economic Affairs Bureau </H5>
  The bureau director, Kazuo Ogura (1961), along with 
classmate 
Minoru Tanba (director of the Treaties Bureau), is an elite 
foreign service officer. of whom it was said from early on, 
"Ogura or Tanba will become administrative vice minister for 
foreign affairs." He has both written and spoken eloquence and 
the articles that he contributes once in a while to the 
"Foreign Affairs Forum," the public relations magazine of MOFA, 
almost always are popular inside and outside the ministry. 
  The councilors who assist Ogura are Kazuo Asaumi (1961) and 
Nobuyasu Abe (1966). Asaumi is the son of former Ambassador to 
the U.S. Koichiro Asaumi, and formerly served as interpreter for 
U.S.-Japan heads-of-state talks. Abe worked hard and rendered 
distinguished service behind the scenes in the economic area for 
the success of the Tokyo summit in July. 
  The general affairs counselor, who also can be called the 
director of the Secretariat for the Economic Affairs Bureau, is 
Yoshiki Mine (1967). The chiefs of the divisions are Kojiro 
Shiojiri (1972), chief of the First International Economic 
Affairs Division which is in charge of trade with the European 
Community (EC) and economic integration, and Koro Bessho (1974), 
chief of the Second International Economic Affairs Division in 
charge of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade). The 
other division chiefs are a galaxy of able men. 
  Japan took the lead role at the Tokyo summit, and it was 
agreed to conclude successfully the Uruguay Round (new 
multilateral trade negotiations) within the year, but it will be 
a test case of the Economic Affairs Bureau whether or not this 
can be realized. 
<H5>  Economic Cooperation Bureau </H5>
  Hiroshi Hirabayashi (1962) was appointed bureau director 
after serving as a minister to the United States in the August 
personnel changes. He immediately displayed his skill in the 
Cambodian postwar reconstruction problem, etc. In his days as 
minister to the United States, he appeared on U.S. television, 
etc., and as a result of his blunt speeches that were 
disagreeable to U.S. ears, it seems that he was kept at a 
distance. When he believes it to be true, he speaks out 
without reserve. From the standpoint of a friend, there is no 
person with such dependable fighting power. 
  The councilor is Shohei Naito (1965). During the Gulf war, 
Japanese in Kuwait became hostages of Iraq and he worked hard 
without sleep or rest for their release. The counselor is 
Hideaki Ueda (1966). Originally, he was in Russian service, and 
economic cooperation has been a different field, but he has been 
cheerfully carrying out his work, including trips to Central 
Asia, ever since his appointment. 
  For the chiefs of the major divisions, Nobuichi Kitajima 
(1970) is the chief of the Planning Division, which can be 
called the secretariat of the Economic Cooperation Bureau. He is 
one of the few foreign service officers in MOFA who came from 
Keio University, but he has melded into the ministry so well 
that officers in the ministry who do not know from what 
university he came are surprised and say, "Did he come from Keio 
University?" In the days of his former job as chief of the First 
International Organizations Division of the Economic Affairs 
Bureau, he worked hard on arrangements for the Uruguay Round and 
was deeply trusted by Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe (at the 
time). 
  The chief of the Technical Cooperation Division is Mitsuo 
Sakaba (1972). Due to joining the ministry from Yokohama City 
University, it seems that human relations were difficult for him 
at first. However, he is deeply trusted by his subordinates for 
his quiet and refined style of work. In addition, Shigekazu Sato 
(1973) is chief of the Loan Aid Division and Masahito Kodera 
(1975) is chief of the Grant Aid Division. On the occasion of 
the visit to China by the emperor and empress, Kodera 
contributed to its success by working devotedly behind the 
scenes as senior administrative officer of the China Division in 
the Asian Affairs Bureau. 
<H5>  Treaties Bureau </H5>
  The bureau director is Minoru Tanba (1961). The director of 
the Treaties Bureau has important jobs such as responding in the 
Budget Committees of both the House of Councilors and the House 
of Representatives and attending conferences with Russia, with 
whom a peace treaty has not been concluded. 
  Tanba is extremely popular with the LDP opposition party and 
therefore it looks like that he need not to worry about being 
bullied by "the strongest opposition party in history." 
  He is an expert on Russia and previously has been known as a 
hardliner on Russian policy, but recently, he has a touch of 
consideration for the U.S. and European position of support for 
Yeltsin and much more flexible. 
  The councilor is Hiroharu Koike (1965), who is working at 
the home ministry for the first time in a long time, after 
serving as a minister of the Japanese Government mission at the 
United Nations. 
  The lineup of division chiefs are Ichiro Komatsu (1971), 
chief of the Treaties Division; Kenjiro Moji (1974), chief of 
the International Conventions Division; and Tetsuo Ito (1972), 
chief of the Legal Affairs Division. 
<H5>  International Information Bureau </H5>
  The bureau director is Haruhiko Shibuya (1962). He slid over 
horizontally from the position of director of the United Nations 
Bureau, which was abolished along with the inauguration of the 
General Foreign Policy Bureau. 
  Previously, as councilor of the Asian Affairs Bureau at the 
time when the crew of the Fujiyama Maru No. 18 was released by 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), he 
traveled together with Ichiro Ozawa (currently acting secretary 
general of the Shinseito) to take charge of the crewmembers in 
Pyongyang. When the special plane landed at Haneda, the 
television [broadcast] that was relayed showed Shibuya who was 
mistaken for a released crewmember. 
  He has many fans at MOFA with his polite manner and honest 
personality that are not common in a foreign service officer. 
  The councilor is Kiyohiko Nanao (1965). It previously seemed 
that his specialty field was economic foreign policy, but since 
serving as a minister to South Korea, he also has become strong 
in the political field. 
  The division chiefs are Makoto Mizutani (1970), chief of the 
International Information Division; Akio Suda (1970), chief of 
the First Analysis Division; and Hiroyuki Kishino (1974), chief 
of the Second Analysis Division. 
<H5>  Other </H5>
  The chief of the Cultural Affairs Department is Takayuki 
Kimura (1961). The weight occupied by cultural exchange in 
Japanese foreign affairs has been increasing year by year, but 
actual results steadily have been produced in diverse fields 
such as Japanese language education abroad, cooperation for 
Japanese research, introduction of Japanese culture abroad, and 
cooperation in the preservation of cultural heritage. 
  Assisting Kimura and substantially working on cultural 
foreign policy are the three, Councilor Takashi Nakamoto (1965), 
Osamu Shiozaki (1972), chief of the First Cultural Affairs 
Division, and Nobutaka Shinomiya (1973), chief of the Second 
Cultural Affairs Division. 
  Nakamoto has served as private secretary to director of the 
Secretariat, Takao Fujinami (at the time) and is one of the 
hopeful leading foreign service officers with expectations for 
the future. 
  Appreciation for the existence of the Consular and 
Emigration 
Affairs Department is increasing more and more along with 
Japanese living and traveling abroad. There also should be some 
people among the general public who have been assisted by the 
department once or twice. 
  Chief of the department is Yoshihisa Ara (1961) and the 
counselor is Norio Hattori (1967). Previously at the time when 
there were many hijacking incidents by the Japanese Red Army, 
the counselor of the Consular and Emigration Affairs Department 
was appointed under careful instruction beforehand about the 
possibility of being exchanged for hostages. 
  Speaking of that, Ryohei Murata, the current ambassador to 
Germany, had experience in that post. He remembers the episode 
on the occasion of the Kuala Lumpur incident when he was 
exchanged for hostages and passed the time by solving crossword 
puzzles in the aircraft together with the enemy, the Japanese 
Red Army. 
  In the same department is the Foreign Nationals Affairs 
Division whose workload has expanded in both quality and 
quantity with the rapid increase of foreigners coming into Japan 
recently. The experts from Division Chief Akio Egawa (1974) and 
on down are tackling the surge of visa applications. 
  An organization that is substantially the same as a 
department is the Arms Control and Scientific Affairs Councilor 
Organization. The head is Akira Hayashi (1963), and the 
counselor is Yoshitaka Kawamura (1967) who was transferred from 
the Asian Affairs Bureau. 
  There are two divisions and two offices in the organization. 
The chief of the Arms Control and Disarmament Division is 
Takeshi Nakane (1973), and the chief of the Scientific Affairs 
and Nuclear Energy Division is Yukihisa Amano (1971). Waiting 
for Nakane is the issue of creating the draft for the nuclear 
test ban treaty, etc. 
  Chief of the International Social Cooperation Department is 
Kojiro Takano (1963). In his days as chief of the General 
Affairs Division of the Japan International Cooperation Agency 
(JICA), he directly faced the incident of the murder of a JICA 
expert by antigovernment guerrillas in Peru, and his memories of 
skillfully dealing with the difficult problem are fresh. 
  In his new post, he handles highly contemporary problems 
such 
as UN administration and finance, human rights, refugees, drugs, 
and wildlife protection. It probably should be viewed as facing 
a chance to make further strides. 
  The counselor is Itaru Umezu (1967), who has had experience 
as the consul in New York. For division chiefs, Yuji Kumamaru 
(1974) is chief of the United Nations Administration Division 
and originally was an expert on China. Chief of the Human Rights 
and Refugee Division is Toshio Kunikata (1975), and chief of the 
Global Scale Problems Division is Toshiki Kanamori. Kanamori is 
a temporary transfer from the Finance Ministry. His proficient 
language capability gives him the advantage. 
  In addition, the councilor in charge of inspection is Takao 
Kawakami (1960). He is the former director of the Economic 
Cooperation Bureau, but the opinion is strong that he will be 
appointed chief of the Cabinet Foreign Policy Councilors' 
Office some day. 
  The ambassador in charge of international trade is Nobutoshi 
Akao (1960). He bears the heavy responsibility for reaching an 
agreement within the year in the Uruguay Round. 
  The ambassador in charge of negotiations on normalizing 
relations between Japan and North Korea is Tetsuya Endo (1957). 
He is a classmate of Vice Minister Saito and also is in charge 
of Asian Pacific cooperation. Japan-North Korea negotiations 
never have been held since Endo became in charge of them, 
and it is not certain whether or not he will be able to put a 
period to the last postwar disposition of Japan. In so far as 
North Korea has been awkward as a negotiation partner, it seems 
that he has faced his crucial moment as a foreign service 
officer. 
  As director of the Foreign Service Training Institute, 
Shintaro Yamashita (1957) is in charge of training young foreign 
service officers. As general guidance officer, Yuji Miyamoto 
(1968) helps Yamashita. 
  Among the foreign service officers temporarily transferred 
to 
other ministries or agencies, Sakutaro Tanino (1959) is the 
chief of the Cabinet Councilors' Office on External Affairs. He 
is an expert on China, has obtained overwhelming support from 
the China school within the ministry, and many have anticipated 
that he will be appointed deputy vice minister for foreign 
affairs after Saito is promoted to vice minister. 
  Hisami Kurokochi (1957), who is known as the oldest forceful 
foreign officer, serves as the chief of the House of 
Representatives Committee on the Foreign Affairs Research Office. 
  The second secretary general of the International Peace 
Cooperation Headquarters is Katsunari Suzuki (1961), the 
previous director of the Information Analysis, Research, and 
Planning Bureau. He immediately made an inspection tour of the 
scene in Cambodia. Yoshiyuki Sadaoka (1973) is the counselor for 
the International Peace Cooperation Headquarters and supports 
Suzuki. 
  In addition, Kazuyuki Hiraoka (1953) is the director of the 
state guest house, Kiyoshi Kadotani (1948) is the lord 
chamberlain of the household, Azusa Hayashi (1968) is chief of 
Police Headquarters, Iwate Prefecture, and Masaji Takahashi 
(1960) is director of the Immigration Bureau, Ministry of 
Justice. 
  The president of JICA is Kensuke Yanagiya (1948). He is 
famous for taking a part in the nuptials of the Crown Prince and 
Masako. JICA director Makoto Watanabe (1958) soon will return to 
the home ministry and is scheduled to be appointed the post of 
Chief of Protocol. 
  Also from MOFA are Shinichiro Asao (1950), director of the 
Japan Foundation, and Toshijiro Nakashima (1948), Supreme Court 
justice. 
<H5>  Overseas Establishments </H5>
  Finally, let's mention the major ambassadors among the 
foreign service officers who are serving in overseas 
establishments. 
  In the Asia Pacific region, Toshio Goto (1953) is in South 
Korea, and Michihiko Kunihiro (1954) is in China. Goto has been 
a consul in South Korea in the past, has served as director of 
the Asian Affairs Bureau, and is most suitable as ambassador to 
South Korea. 
  Kimio Fujita in Indonesia and Hiroaki Fujii in Thailand both 
passed the foreign service officer exam in 1955, and are fellow 
rivals. Along with Koji Watanabe, ambassador to Italy in the 
same 1955 group, they are called the triumvirate of vice 
minister candidates. In Australia Kazutoshi Hasegawa (1956) who 
served as private secretary to Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone 
(at the time). 
  In the North American region, Takakazu Kuriyama (1953) is in 
the United States. It was rumored that Hisashi Owada, previous 
administrative vice minister for foreign affairs, would be 
appointed ambassador to the United States and it seems that 
Kuriyama has difficulty doing the job, but he will continue 
until at least the end of 1994. Noboru Nakahira (1953) is in 
Canada. In his previous appointment, he served as ambassador in 
charge of Japan-North Korea negotiations. 
  Turning an eye to the European region, Sumio Edamura (1951) 
is in Russia. He will retire after the visit to Japan by 
President Yeltsin in October and Koji Watanabe will take his 
place. Hiroshi Kitamura (1952) is in Great Britain, Atsuhiko 
Yatabe (1951) is in France, and Ryohei Murata (1951) is in 
Germany. 
  In the Middle East and African region, Taizo Watanabe (1956) 
is in Egypt, Hiroshi Ota (1959) is in Saudi Arabia, and Takeshi 
Ohara (1960) is in Iran. 
  In charge of international agencies, Yoshio Hatano (1952) is 
at the United Nations, Yoshitomo Tanaka (1955) is at the 
Disarmament Conference, and Yoshiyasu Sato (1957) is at the 
Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. Sato is 
from Hitotsubashi University. He is strongly trusted by his 
schoolmate, former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe, and if 
Foreign Minister Watanabe had continued on, it is said that he 
would have been appointed vice minister instead of Saito. 
  Among these ambassadors, Kitamura and Hatano are scheduled 
to 
be replaced in the near future, and the personnel changes for 
successors probably will be a topic of conversation.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, January 26 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
former chief of the counterintelligence Colonel L. Sanjaasuren 
has notified the chairman and the vice chairman of the 
parliament and the prime minister that in case these high 
officials not made clear conclusions he is ready to make public 
new facts telling about their involvement in corruption and 
contacts with secret services of some foreign states. In this 
way the former chief of the counterintelligence who has been 
removed recently from the office expressed his readiness to 
complete "the case." L. Sanjaasuren started from fact than at 
the end of the last year he has held a press conference at which 
he informed that there are materials documents in his department 
telling about possible contacts of the above mentioned high 
officials with foreign secret services. The parliament working 
group on investigation of this information has not revealed any 
signs telling about liquidation of these materials as L. 
Sanjaasuren supposed in this connection. Colonel L. Sanjaasuren 
had to announce that a special system of concealing improper 
deeds of state high officials is already formed in the country. 
As far as the parliament speaker N. Bagadandi, vice speaker J. 
Gombojav, and the Prime Minister P. Jasray are concerned they 
are resolutely rejecting the charges of L. Sanjaasuren and the 
press.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, January 26 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
newspaper ARDYN ERH publishes an article by its correspondent 
trying to clear up the circumstances around the scandalous case 
with an "Mi-8" helicopter with 27005 number on its board. 
  The helicopter crossed illegally the Mongolian frontier 
bordering on the Russian Federation on June 28 and up to now is 
on the Buyant-Uhaa Airport. 
  According to a competent officer of the investigating board 
under the Central Police Department by August 20 the general 
board on ensuring state security by its former name had 
instituted proceedings in connection with the helicopter and 
carried out proper investigations. It was found that pilots of 
the helicopter had returned home after taking it to Mongolia. 
The other day Deputy Director of the Russian "Godli" firm B. B. 
Gomboyev came to Ulaanbaatar with the purpose of receiving money 
for the helicopter having been sold to the Mongolian "Oyuny 
Undraa" firm. In response to it we have demanded to send here 
their pilots having violated the law of the country, he said. 
  According to him, the Mongolian "Oyuny Undraa" firm did not 
purchase the helicopter for itself but played only the role of a 
mediator in the selling of the helicopter.

  [Text] The daily MERDEKA highlights the dispute over the 
islands of Sipadan and Ligitan. The daily understands 
Malaysia's apprehension if the International Court of Justice 
confirms Indonesian ownership of the two disputed islands 
because the sea lanes from Tawau to Malaysia's Exclusive 
Economic Zone situated in the Sulawesi Straits will be under 
Indonesian control. However, MERDEKA hopes that Malaysia will 
discard such a narrow-minded perception and will instead adopt a 
far-sighted attitude. 
  The daily reiterates that Indonesia has no intention 
whatsoever of putting Malaysia in a disadvantageous position. 
It recalls that Southeast Asia was once a kingdom alternatively 
ruled by sovereign rulers in the southern part of the Malay 
archipelago and in the Malay Peninsula. It adds: Why can't the 
fact that Singapore -- the majority of whose population is not 
of Malay stock -- is able to cooperate with Indonesia in 
developing the Riau islands serve as an example for Indonesia 
and Malaysia -- whose peoples have the same forefathers -to have 
good relations?

  [Text] Jakarta, Jan 29 (ANTARA) -- In response to recent 
talks between President Suharto and Bosnian President Alija 
Izetbegovic, Indonesia plans to post an RI [Republic of 
Indonesia] ambassador in Sarajevo, Bosnia, this year. 
  Foreign Minister Ali Alatas told the press after 
inaugurating 
Syam Sumanagara as inspector general at the Foreign Ministry 
here over the weekend that the realization of the plan to open 
full diplomatic ties with Bosnia should be implemented soon. 
  "We are just waiting for a decision on who will be appointed 
Indonesian ambassador to Bosnia," he said, adding that Bosnia is 
also considering a reciprocal step. 
  The plan to open full diplomatic ties between Indonesia and 
Bosnia has been discussed by President Suharto and Bosnian 
President Alija Izetbegovic, who visited Indonesia recently. 
  Alatas said that Indonesia will maintain its stance to 
support Bosnia on the issue of the lifting of arms embargo 
imposed by the United Nations to Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  He said that Indonesia also backs Bosnia's rejection to the 
idea or resolution of lands division in the region. [passage

  [Text] Speaking to newsmen at the Sukarno-Hatta 
International Airport on his return from a three-day visit to 
Yemen yesterday, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas expressed his 
opinion that the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem could probably be 
settled through the Nonalignment Movement, NAM and the Islamic 
Organization Conference, ICO, because of the larger number of 
countries involved in the issue. Minister Ali Alatas was 
optimistic that if a conference was hosted by the Nonalignment 
Movement and ICO, there was a hope that peace would be restored 
to Bosnia when compared to the unilateral conferences held in 
Geneva. 
  According to the minister, a long series of conferences had 
already been held and Bosnia is concerned over the 
responsibility and attitude of the United Nations Security 
Council.

  [Text] The ABRI [Indonesian Armed Forces] patrols along 
the Indonesia-Papua New Guinea border regions in Irian Jaya have 
never intruded into the neighboring country's territory. 
  When meeting with Papua New Guinean Defense Minister Paul 
Tohian in Jayapura, Brigadier-General Rustam Kastor, Commander 
of the 8th Trikora Regional Command, stressed that Papua New 
Guinea's news report about ABRI's patrols intruding into the 
neighboring country was untrue. He said he considered the 
reports as irresponsible and that they have been brought up by 
certain groups to destroy the existing good relations of the two 
governments. He said Indonesia respects the sovereignty of 
other countries, including Papua New Guinea and ABRI, in 
carrying out its responsibilities, places its territorial 
operations as top priority. In carrying out its duties, ABRI has 
never used military strength. Rather, it chooses to use greater 
contact with the local community, including separatist groups in 
efforts to make them realize of their mistakes. 
  Apart from meeting with the 8th Trikora Regional Commander, 
the Papua New Guinean defense minister also met with the 
governor of Irian Jaya, Jacob Pantiri. He also observed the 
ongoing development of a toll road network from Irian Jaya to 
Mutong in Papua New Guinea.

  [Text] New York, Jan 29 (ANTARA) -- Indonesia is set to 
open diplomatic ties with Saint Lucia, a small nation in the 
eastern part of the Caribbean. Information Officer at the 
Indonesian Embassy in Washington Hupudio Supardi said here 
Friday the signing of a joint communique on the opening of the 
diplomatic relations between the two countries will be carried 
out at the Indonesian Embassy on February 2. 
  With these new diplomatic ties, Arifin Siregar will become 
Indonesian ambassador to the United States, and pluralistically 
to Grenada, Saint Vincent, and Saint Lucia. 
  The opening of diplomatic relations with Saint Vincent was 
conducted in Washington on November 30, 1993, shortly after 
Arifin assumed his position as Indonesian ambassador to the 
United States, while the diplomatic ties with Grenada was opened 
during the term of Ambassador A.R. Ramly. 
  According to the embassy spokesman, Indonesia's diplomatic 
relations with Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent, and Grenada are of 
high political significance, as the small Caribbean countries 
each have the same vote as the major countries. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Addressing the 21st anniversary of the United 
Development Party (PPP) on 5 January, Party Chairman H.Ismail 
Hassan Metareum stressed that the quest for greater political 
openess and democracy has become a dominant issue in the life of 
the people now. This is a consequence of the success achieved by 
Indonesia during the first 25-year long-term development master 
plan. 
  We agree with the PPP chairman's claim that the people's 
increasing maturity in political affairs has led them to demand 
for greater democracy and further encourage them to fight for 
their rights and to protect their interests. These are the 
products of the political development that has been continuously 
implemented by the new order government. Likewise, the fact 
that the people have higher aspirations and are becoming more 
critical is inseparable from the development progress. 
  Many highly intellectual younger Indonesians, who have been 
educated overseas, and their counterparts, who have been growing 
up under the new order government over the last 25 years, did 
not face the rebellion by the G-30-S/PKI [30 September 
Movement/Indonesian Communist Party] at all. They did not 
experience the struggle for national independence and the 
physical revolution from 1945 to the 1950's. They only know 
about these facts through reading material. This means that even 
the current young generation, who are under 25 years old, was 
not born yet when the country was struggling for independence. 
They too are ignorant of the G-30-S/PKI uprising in 1965. 
  In view of this, we can expect the Indonesian young 
generation, who returned to their homeland after completing 
their studies overseas, and other youths growing up during the 
new order's development program and those who were born after 
the G-30-S/PKI uprising to have a dynamism, aspirations, and 
visions that are different from those of the pre-G-30-S/PKI 
uprising generation. 
  Basically, we can understand that it is difficult for the 
youths, who are currently below 25 years old, to understand why 
the government still fears danger from the leftist and rightist 
extremists in the country. 
  We are highlighting these reasons to reaffirm Metareum's 
statement on the current need for greater political openess and 
greater democracy. Relatively speaking, when our current young 
generation becomes more daring and expresses their ideas and 
criticisms against government officials, this should be accepted 
as something normal and as the outcome of the development 
achievements in various fields. 
  In this case, the dynamism, aspirations, and visions that 
are 
spreading now would, perhaps, be different from those of the 
older generation. This in turn should be considered fair, 
frank, and constructive. It is hoped that our government 
officials can be more accomodating of the dynamism and 
development of political awareness in the country. They should 
be tactful in promoting openess by holding dialogues with the 
people without over-emphasizing approaches to national security. 
[passage omitted] 
  There is a possibility that the selection of the PPP 
leadership is based on the figures' political affiliations, 
rather than on true qualifications. Factional differences, 
however, could bridge together by considering the cadreization 
system implemented by the figures running in the party election. 
  Even though we are a little late in sending our greetings to 
the PPP on the occassion of its 21st anniversary, we hope that 
the PPP will always be one of our successful socio-political 
forces and is able to implement development programs as desired 
by the new order government.

  [Text] Jakarta, Jan 29 (ANTARA) -- Finance Minister Mar'ie 
Muhammad said Saturday the government's step to secure U.S.$400 
million worth of external standby loans is not related to the 
collapse of crude price. 
  "Neither is it needed to strengthen the position of the 
country's foreign exchange reserves which currently stand at 
U.S.$12 billion," the minister said after a meeting with 
President Suharto. 
  The Indonesian Government is now seeking foreign funds as a 
standby loan that can be cashed any time when needed. 
  The central bank, Bank Indonesia, (BI) has given a mandate 
to 
six foreign banks to provide the syndicated loan. 
  The six foreign banks are Chase Manhattan, the Industrial 
Bank of Japan, the Bank of Tokyo, Banque Nationale de Paris, 
Dresdner Bank and the Long-Term Credit Bank. 
  Mar'ie Muhammad said that the government's effort to get 
standby loan is just a normal thing so that there is no need to 
kick a fuss about. Explaining the background of the need to 
secure a standby loan, the minister said that a government -- or 
state-owned project -- usually gets export credits about 80-85 
percent of the project's total value only. 
  "The remaining 15-20 percent should be covered by the 
government itself," he said, adding that "We can use our own 
funds but they could reduce our foreign exchange reserves." 
  The external export credits are never enough to finance 
government's projects, he added. 
  For the first two-year period, the interest rate of the loan 
is set at 0.75 above the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) 
and in the third year the rate will be increased to 0.875 
percent. 
  Carrying a five-year gcece period, the loan will be repaid 
in 
five phases in every six months. 
  The agreement on the loan will be signed in March.

  [Text] Reports that ASEAN will hold economic talks with 
Taiwan have been dismissed as untrue. In a press statement

Taiwan. The ASEAN secretary general stressed that it is normal 
for ASEAN businessmen to hold consultations with third parties 
at international meetings. In this connection, Datuk Ajit Singh 
said ASEAN officials may hold hold informal talks with Taiwanese 
counterparts at an APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation] 
meeting in Jakarta at the end of this month.

<F P=106> [Article by Jauhari Teguh Sugiharto] </F>
  [Text] Jakarta, Jan 28 (ANTARA) -- Aceh fishermen have 
come out from silence to vent anger at the increasing number of 
foreign poachers in their waters by throwing molotov cocktails 
at intruders. 
  They even threatened to use guns if the foreigners insisted 
on entering the area without permission. 
  Seemingly, the action comes as a call for more attention to 
preventing poaching cases in other waters of this archipelago, 
right from its westernmost province of Aceh to the easternmost 
province of Irian Jaya. 
  The fishermen's action has caused some officials to urge the 
government to take necessary measures. 
  Aceh regional House of Representatives' Commission B 
secretary Fuad Zakaria said the government should pay special 
attention to the problem. 
  "It is now high time that security forces intensify their 
patrol of Aceh waters and if poaching continues, the central 
government in Jakarta should send protests to countries 
concerned," he added. 
  Aceh is not the only victim of poaching. Foreign fishermen 
have also intruded into North Sumatra's waters and South 
Sumatra's Bangka and Belitung Islands. 
  Reports from Bangka said that tens of foreign fishermen were 
left unrestricted to operate in the region. Apart from the 
indiscriminate exploitation of marine resources, their 
operations also destroy the fish's natural habitat and 
frustrating local fishermen from their income. 
  Head of South Sumatra police public relations chief 
Lieutenant Colonel Syahrifudin Madri Gumay said that action has 
been taken with the arrest of a foreign trawler. 
  "Together with the special waters police, we constantly 
supervise the waters around Bangka and Natuna Islands and will 
continue to seek more information on the foregin fishermen," he 
said. 
  An official of the local waters police, Police Captain R. 
Nasution confirmed that there have been reports of the increased 
poaching by foreign fishermen in Indonesian waters. 
  He said a Task Force has caught a foreign trawler red handed 
with a dead weight of 99 tonnes. It carried a number of foreign 
crewmen. 
  "We found tonnes of fish catch, large trawling nets and 
corals as evidence," he said, adding that other fishing ships 
managed to escape. 
  Nasution noted that the local police's equipment was almost 
no match for the foreigners who got away. 
  Director general of fishery at the Agriculture Ministry 
Mokhtar Abdullah said that marine exploitation in Malacca Strait 
should not be allowed to threaten international relations as 
many countries have their own interests at stake. 
  According to biological resources director Sukoco Adi 
Sutrisno, speaking in a meeting recently, said that the Malacca 
Strait is part of the Exclusive Economic Zone and a crowded 
international sea lane. 
  It contains a fish resource of about 332,000 tons per year 
including shrimps and coral fish. 
  "They are already being exploited by fishermen from Aceh, 
North Sumatra, Riau and those who have license to operate from 
the central government in Jakarta. 
  Meanwhile, reports from the eastern part of Indonesia said 
that foreign poachers in the region are equipped with modern and 
comprehensive facilities such as fish location detector. 
  Many of their trawlers fishing ships are like "floating 
factories": catching fishes and directly manufacturing them in 
the ship, so that when they anchor at a port they only have to 
sell their goods. 
  Reports from Central Maluku said that some 16 foreign 
fishermen were jailed in Halmahera last year for illegally 
entering Indonesian waters. 
  Sulawesi, Irian Jaya and Nusa Tenggara waters are also among 
the targets of foreign poachers. 
  The reports should therefore be sufficient enough evidence 
that poaching by foreign fishermen in Indonesia exists and they 
harm the interest of the country, particularly our own fishermen.

  [Text] Thailand's English language daily BANGKOK POST on 27 
January carried a headline saying: Thais Claim 100 Die From 
Torture After Breaking Laos' Border Law. Quoting slanderous 
charges made by a Thai citizen, Mr. Anonglak Khambunruang, 23, 
the newspaper reported that the said Thai citizen accused Lao 
authorities of failing to look after and torturing Thai citizens 
who are arrested and detained for illegally entering Laos. 
  The truth is that Mr. Anonglak Khambunruang was recently 
detained by Lao authorities in Champassak Province for 
committing violations against the laws of the Lao People's 
Democratic Republic. The Lao authorities, however, later 
released and sent him back to Thailand. 
  KPL categorically denies the allegations published by the 
BANGKOK POST which irresponsibly quoted the fabricated charges 
made by Mr. Anonglak Khambunruang. We hold that the slanderous 
charges are baseless and have been fabricated to purely serve 
certain bad elements in Thailand who are intent on undermining 
the relations of friendship and good neighborliness between the 
Lao and Thai peoples which are currently developing favorably.

<F P=106> ["President Berisha's New Year Address to Albanian People" </F>
-- ATA headline] 
  [Text] Tirana, January 1 (ATA) -- Dear brothers, sisters, 
respected compatriots wherever you are, ladies and gentlemen, 
  Through this address I wholeheartedly wish you a happy new 
year! May the year 1994 bring joy, happiness, harmony and great 
prosperity for your families, and your children and friends. 
  The year which is going out was a good year for us. It was a 
year of efforts, challenges and successes for the whole Albanian 
nation. At the age of a nation every minute, hour and day is of 
great importance. But I would distinguish among all ages that 
democracy is the most important and it itself has its most 
significant and decisive moments. The year 1993 was determinant 
to the reforms program in Albania. By the end year let us think 
for a moment of the position of the Albanian society in the 
past, the troubled waters it was in two or five years ago. If 
we do this we will all feel a great joy that our ship was able 
to come to anchor towards freedom. Thus we joyfully celebrate 
the new year being sure and optimistic for the future of free 
Albania. Tonight let us recall Albania of some years ago and if 
we do this we will never forget the price of freedom we enjoy 
today. However bitter Albania's past history, we can see the 
progress we have made. If we throw a glance on the road we have 
traversed in such a time we will see that the progress of 
Albanian people during a year of work and efforts is enormous. 
Albania of 1993, despite the great troubles and hardships has 
quite completely changed its view and sees to the new year with 
a higher standard than 1993. 
  We rightfully call the year 1993 as the year of great 
turning 
point on the road of all-sided consolidation of reforms in 
Albania. During this year we were able to transform Albania, the 
country of chaos, anarchy, organized state corruption, poverty 
and hunger, gallopant inflation and paralyzed economy into a 
country of free citizens, private farmer, free enterprise, free 
creators. Albania is now a country where political legislative, 
institutional and economic reforms are successfully carried out. 
So Albania is moving towards the establishment of a genuine 
civilized society. 
  Brothers and sisters, 
  During 1993 harmony and understanding among people have 
increased. Both of them were an empty notion without freedom. 
The human rights and freedoms charter was endorsed and these 
rights and freedoms are developing constantly. The necessary 
legislation for the transition into a market economy was 
drafted, the institutions of the rule of law were consolidated, 
economic reform marked a great turning point. A paralysed 
Albanian economy was replaced by free market economy, inflation 
was put under complete control, lands, houses and hundreds of 
enterprises were privatized. 
  The growth of gross production is the greatest achievement 
of 
the reform. Compared to a year ago, goods turnover is several 
times higher, export and import increased by 3-5 times. Albania 
which two years ago counted its witch-hunters has now its rich 
men. 
  Human dimension of Albanian society have increased and will 
continue to increase in the future due to the social component 
of market economy, social assistance and economic support, the 
reduction of work days and several other achievements. 
Spiritual and cultural life, the genius of Albanian creators 
recorded a great development and their talent was in blossom 
during 1993. But I would say that what has changed more is our 
psychology. In this way the psychology of totalitarian society 
was replaced by psychology of free market. Tolerance, respect 
for man and his freedoms, understanding and optimism 
characterize the individual and national psychology. During 
1993 Albania and Albanians, through efforts, pains, sacrifices 
and achievements for the establishment of the rule of law and 
market economy, moved closer to Europe and the civilized world, 
deserved their generous aid, support and respect. Albania's 
image in the world at present is quite different. 
  Historic progress was made in cooperation with our 
neighbours, member countries of the European Union, the United 
States, Islamic countries and international institutions. 
Albanians proved to be serious partners and displayed their 
determination for building a free and democratic society. They 
are determined to follow a foreign policy which intends to 
integrate Albania into Europe, to prevent conflict in the 
region, and resolve correctly the issue of Albanians in former 
Yugoslavia. The year 1993 was another year of terror for 
Albanians in Kosova. 
  Police violence, savage dictatorship, poverty, and 
persecution kept growing. In front of this barbarous stand, 
which relies on the ideology of crime, massacre and annihilation 
of another nation, is the civilized, determined and wise 
attitude of self-controlled Albanians who know that freedom is 
eternal while violence and terror have their days numbered. The 
just issue of Albanians in Kosova and former Yugoslavia was 
presented to the UN. The European Union and international 
community appreciate more and more the role of Albanians as a 
factor of stability in the region and today it is clear to them 
that without the correct solution of Kosova issue, without 
guaranteeing the human rights and national freedoms of Albanians 
in former Yugoslavia, the resolution of Balkan crisis is 
impossible. 
  In spite of our great and incontestible achievements during 
1993 we are aware of the great problems and difficulties lying 
in store for 1994. Priority will be given to reduction of 
unemployment, construction of infrastructure, attraction of 
investors, privatization of mid and large-sized enterprises and 
the establishment of vouchers' market. In regard to foreign 
policy Albania will give priority to its integration into Europe 
and international community, the correct solution of the 
Albanian nationality issue. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, 
  Great challenges lie in store during 1994. But our 
capabilities to solve them are several times greater. The new 
year will be a year of the vigor of freedom because a great 
vigor has burst out today among all Albanian citizens wherever 
they work and live. The year 1994 will be a touch stone for us. 
Success will depend on how wise and capable we will be to make 
use of constant vigour of freedom to step up the development of 
Albania and make for the lost time. In fact we have a long way 
to go through in order to get there where we wish to. But 
Albania is a young nation and young nations have great energies, 
they progress quickly in freedom. I am optimistic and sure that 
in 1994 we will fulfil our hopes and will meet the established 
goals. Let us make use of the vigor of freedom to be closer 
each other, and be more united than ever, as brothers of blood, 
spirit and freedom to build a more prosperous present and future 
for our children and outselves. Let us use the vigor of freedom 
to raise high the name and honour of Albanians and Albania, and 
to integrate Albania more and more into Europe and the world. 
  I appeal to all your brothers and sisters, to toast and wish 
Albanians in Albania, Kosova, emigration, diaspora, wherever 
they are, in city or countryside, in their homes,in military 
units, in navigation, in hospitals, prisons or in the border, as 
well as their friends in the Balkans, Europe and the world : A 
happy new year! I also wish them all good health, happiness and 
prosperity. 
  God bless Albania and the year 1994.

<F P=106> [News conference by President Sali Berisha with foreign and </F>
domestic correspondents in Tirana on 30 December -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Xhevdet Shehu] Xhevdet 
Shehu. Mr. President, after the departure of [the Italian 
humanitarian operation known as] Pelican, there were rumors that 
our relations with Italy were deteriorating. Is this true? I 
would like to ask another question, if I may: For some time 
now, the events of the Democratic Prosperity Party in Macedonia 
have attracted the attention of the Albanian public and have 
been commented on in various ways. The newspaper RILINDJA of 
Kosova wrote yesterday about a distinction in your attitude and 
that of Mr. Rugova regarding this party. What exactly is your 
opinion? 
  [Berisha] [passage omitted] Regarding the rumors that our 
relations with Italy have deteriorated, I consider them to be 
completely false. Our relations with Italy are of a friendly 
nature. Italy is a country that has helped Albania, and I am 
convinced that the Albanians are and will be grateful to the 
Italian people for the noble assistance they have rendered to 
Albania. We should keep one thing in mind though: Friendship 
and speed are two different things. When establishing a 
friendship, it is important to base it on a solid and strong 
foundation. We are determined to develop and maintain friendly 
relations with Italy and the Italian people. As for Pelican, it 
left because its mission was over. I think the Pelican 
operation felt the greatest pleasure of all of us. After 
performing its large humanitarian mission, Pelican saw that the 
friendly country, with which it was related, had reached its 
required level of efficiency. [passage omitted] 
  Therefore, Pelican finished its mission and left. There is 
no room for a shadow, and it did not leave any trace of one. 
Pelican came as a humanitarian mission and left after honestly 
performing its work. 
  There is no distinction between Rugova and Tirana regarding 
the assessments and attitudes toward developments in Macedonia's 
main political force. Our ideas and concessions are identical. 
  [Ndrek Gjini, ATA] Ndrek Gjini of ATA. How do you feel 
about the attacks from the left? [passage omitted] 
  [Berisha] If you are referring to the press, I can openly 
say that I do not like it if I am attacked by the press. 
[passage omitted] 
  The press is a very important institution of freedom and 
democracy. If the press abuses its freedom, do not think that 
it goes without being judged. There is a judge for the press, 
and the most powerful judge for the press is the public. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Edi Paloka, RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE] Edi Paloka of RILINDJA 
DEMOKRATIKE. In the extremist leftist circles, a new idea is 
circulating about early elections. The idea is that PASOK 
[Panhellenic Socialist Movement], who won the elections in 
Greece, wants to overthrow the Meksi government. What do you 
think about this? 
  [Berisha] This is a constant idea in the minds of some 
leftist leaders. In another meeting with you, I reiterated that 
this idea is being expressed by one of the main exponents of the 
Albanian left that we would like to hold elections on 23 March. 
This formula clearly shows their extraordinary zest for power 
and a conversion of power into an aim. This expresses old 
careerist ambitions and a non-adaption to the loss of power. As 
for the relation to and victory of this or that party, I think 
that they are completely... [changes thought] First, every 
victory of a party is determined by votes from the people. I am 
sure that with Mr. Papandreou's government, we will develop 
normal and friendly relations. Albania has been and will remain 
outside ideological friendships. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] How do you assess the results 
of Ibrahim Rugova in France, and what role do you think Albanian 
policy has played in this framework? Do you think that the 
Zhirinovskiy phenomenon is spreading in East Europe as it is 
presented or is it part of a temporary phenomenon in the Soviet 
crisis? 
  [Berisha] I have always greeted and continue to greet the 
invitation that the French foreign minister, Mr. Alain Juppe, 
forwarded to Mr. Rugova. I consider as very important the 
establishment of a dialogue between the legitimate 
representatives of the people of Kosova with the EC member 
countries and the EC main countries, as well as with other 
countries. I think that the French Government, the government 
of Mr. Balladur, has already given new dimensions to the problem 
of Albanians in the former Yugoslavia and the Balkan crisis. 
  Concerning Zhirinovskiy, this phenomenon is as invented as 
it is dangerous and as mystic as it is real. In my opinion, 
Yeltsin won in the last elections. Through the Russian 
Constitution, President Yeltsin was able to mark a historic 
victory for the Russian people. The Russian political scene, 
however, has historically had its mystic aspects. [words 
indistinct] Thus, even Zhirinovskiy in this [words indistinct] 
is a mystic phenomenon in politics or rather [words indistinct] 
in a posttotalitarian society. What exactly does he represent? 
He represents the displacement from one extreme to another of a 
large psychology or rather a large mass of people with a 
totalitarian psychology -- that is, a mass of people who, 
unfortunately, have been embodied with and are still not 
liberated from the totalitarian psychology. They were 
transferred from supporters of, let us say, the left-wing 
extreme into supporters of the right-wing extreme. 
  Despite the present results, I think that Zhirinovskiy is 
and 
should be a strong political signal for the West. This farmer 
is seeking more powerful support from the democratic forces. To 
be honest, the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon has more of an emphasis 
in Russia than in another country because in every kind of 
situation, rich or not, Russia is a very powerful factor, not 
only in Europe but worldwide. Russia is a large country that 
plays a great role. It cannot be judged simply on whether it 
produced wheat this year or not. Thus, the development of 
democracy in Russia is extremely important for Europe, as well 
as the world. 
  Is it possible that the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon could be 
repeated in Eastern Europe? It could be repeated but not in a 
Russian context. If we were to analyze or take the moment 
[words indistinct] from the left to the right of a mass of 
people who are still preserving the totalitarian psychology, 
this is justifiable because the totalitarian society in Russia 
was the oldest in Europe; it was 70 years old. That is why the 
liberation from the totalitarian psychology is more slow. In 
this aspect, I do not think that the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon 
will gain any strength, not even in Russia. The gradual 
liberation of people from the totalitarian psychology will cause 
Zhirinovskiy to rely on them. This phenomenon will not develop 
in other European countries. It can appear, but it will not 
develop. 
  [Pellumb Baci, Deutsche Welle] Pellumb Baci of DEUTSCHE 
WELLE. Mr. President [words indistinct] you are insisting that 
the embargo against Serbia is essential. On the contrary, 
several Western political circles have asked that the embargo be 
lifted, almost to the point of completely abolishing it. What 
are the real chances of both attitudes, and what will be the 
consequences if the embargo is abolished? [passage omitted] 
  [Berisha] We are insisting that the embargo against Serbia 
be maintained in order to prevent the conflict from spreading to 
the Balkans. The truth is that the embargo is, perhaps, the 
only Security Council resolution to be carried out, not exactly 
in full but in approximately full efficiency. For all analysts, 
there is no doubt that this embargo plays a role in weakening 
Belgrade's aggressive potential. To reward Milosevic by 
abolishing the embargo and asking him to give back the occupied 
territories would, in my opinion, create the precedence of 
occupying other territories and setting up another chain of 
rewards and compromises that could be dangerous for the Balkans 
and Europe. The embargo was inflicted as a result of Belgrade's 
aggressive policy. It was not an expression of revenge by a 
country against Serbia or the Serbian people. It was a 
punishment for the aggressive policy that the Serbian leadership 
followed in the Balkans. 
  What are the chances? It is difficult to determine what the 
chances are. However, the danger and the consequences of 
abolishing the embargo could be very serious. [passage omitted] 
  [Unidentified correspondent] As BBC reported, Mr. Papandreou 
greeted Albanians on the New Year. How do you feel about this? 
The second question concerns foreign investments. How is the 
present situation and what are the prospects? 
  [Berisha] In response to the first question, although it is 
a news [word indistinct] a wish from a friendly country or a 
country with which we should develop friendly relations is 
always welcomed. Of course, there is no doubt that we have had 
our problems, but the neighboring countries and all other 
countries are important for us. 
  We will be loyal to the principle of reciprocity in our 
policies. This is and will be the main principle of our foreign 
policy. We are offering honest cooperation and sincere 
relations to our neighbors. This is a confident road of 
cooperation with Albania or enhancing cooperation with Albania. 
Every other attempt will only fail. All those who, through 
other forms or methods, tried to condition or impose their ideas 
on Albania have made and are still making mistakes and have 
failed and still continue to fail. Albania has been and will be 
open. On the basis of this principle, it will establish 
relations with all countries and will consider as a friend the 
one who is interested in a sincere friendship. It will know to 
be neutral toward the one who wishes to be neutral, and it will 
know to disgust everyone that will try to disgust her. Thus, in 
our relations with neighbors and far-away countries, the main 
principle will be that of reciprocity. We offer honest 
cooperation to the others and we ask the same thing from them. 
  As for foreign investments, I think that this extremely 
important knot is heading toward a solution. There were 
difficulties concerning the legislative, psychological, and 
regional orders. On this occasion, I am appealing once again to 
Albanians to demonstrate that friendly potential they have in 
their soul to foreign investors. We should keep in mind that 
forming partnerships with foreigners is a very important when it 
comes to accelerating the country's development. In this 
respect, we will further improve our legislation next month. 
The Law on Foreign Investments is among the best, and 
parliament recently passed two very important amendments -- the 
price of land, and I hope parliament will approve the sale of 
land, and the price of agricultural land. 
  Finally, a great possibility for investments will be the 
application of securities and the creation of markets. They 
will grant the opportunity to Albanians to become partners and 
participate in these processes, either in creating joint 
ventures with them or buying the enterprises. Thus, the 
creation of securities and their application will bring about a 
powerful stimulus in attracting foreign investments, because 
foreign investors definitely prefer the individual more than the 
state. This is quite normal. The private individual in Albania 
has had many limited opportunities. The securities will 
increase these opportunities by a certain percentage. Thus, 
this year cannot end with forecasts; the successes are much 
better than can be imagined. We have $200 million worth of 
investment. In fact, we have already signed contracts for next 
year, which can possibly double this amount in ore industry and 
other fields. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] [passage omitted] What 
concrete successes has Albania achieved this year in domestic 
and foreign fields? What main goals do you plan to achieve next 
year in domestic and foreign policy? 
  [Berisha] Regarding Albania's concrete successes this year, 
I can summarize them and say that politically, Albania has made 
confident steps toward its integration in international 
institutions and countries of Europe and toward a further 
affinity with other countries, including your country [as heard] 
as well. The visit of your foreign minister is a remarkable 
event and has rendered an indisputable contribution and in the 
new relations we plan to establish with your big country. I can 
say that there were great achievements in the legislative field 
as well. The greatest of all is undoubtedly the Charter on 
Human Rights and Freedoms. It is a monument of the right in 
European standards. Of the same importance are laws on foreign 
investments, banks, privatization, the status of persecutees and 
prisoners, and a series of other institutions. Another 
achievement is the increase of production. I think that this 
marks a great success for Albania. 
  Considering next year, we hope to wisely use the impetus of 
freedom. Albania is experiencing a moment of impetus, and this 
should be used as wisely and rationally as possible. Thus, next 
year, we hope to achieve good results concerning the large-scale 
privatization of medium and large enterprises. Privatization 
marked new achievements last year and this year. Out of 600 
enterprises, more than 500 have been privatized. The land is 
privatized as are the houses. However, the use of securities 
will grant great possibilities to the enterprises privatized on 
a large scale. I consider this to be the most important problem 
next year. 
  Of course, the opening and integration of Albania in Europe 
and the international community is and remains another constant 
goal of ours. I have stressed over and over that Albania will 
strictly adhere to the principal of reciprocity. 
  The solution of the Balkan crisis and national question is 
another priority of our foreign policy. In this framework, I 
think that 1992 marked another level concerning the issue of 
Albanians in the former Yugoslavia and the Albanian national 
question. Europe is finally convinced that the problem of 
Kosova is an international question. Thus, it is necessary that 
Albanian political forces and the Albanian Government be more 
active and more energetic in their dialogues with international 
community governments in explaining the truth that was darkened 
by history and half a century of Greater Serbian propaganda. At 
the same time, while solving this problem, it is necessary for 
Albania to remain loyal to the agreements it has signed and show 
that it is a serious constructive partner. The acceptance of 
Albania's stabilizing role in the Balkans is undoubtedly the one 
proof that Albanians carry more weight in the dialogue with the 
international community in solving these problems. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Evgeniya Drumeva] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, December 29 (BTA) -- Bulgarian President 
Zhelyu Zhelev described the leader of the Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP) in Russia as an "outright fascist." Interviewed for 
the National Television and talking to Bulgarian and foreign 
reporters, President Zhelev expressed his serious concern over 
"the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon," comparing the Russian politician 
to Hitler three times. Dr. Zhelev voiced his doubts that Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy would ever be allowed to visit Bulgaria again, no 
matter what his future position might be. 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy arrived on a private visit to Bulgaria 
on the evening of December 25. In the three days of his stay, 
he made a number of statements saying, among other things, that 
President Zhelev should be replaced with one of his advisers, 
Bulgarian-born Svetoslav Stoilov, unknown here so far, that 
Bulgaria should regain Thrace, Macedonia and Dobrudzha, and that 
Romania was an invented state. At 1930 hours local time last 
night, the Bulgarian Ministry of the Interior ordered Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy to leave this country within 24 hours. The Sofia 
Airport authorities reported that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy left on 
a regular service flight to Moscow at 1420 hours local time 
today. 
  "A self-respecting sovereign state cannot allow any 
politician coming from another country, be it even a great 
power, to insult the people he has come to by his statements, 
injure the country's sovereignty and retailor the borders it has 
with neighbouring countries, especially at a time when 
hostilities are going on in the immediate proximity, or strike 
off at one scoop whole states as in the case of Romania, a 
circumstance which, if we keep silent, could sour this country's 
relations with its neighbours," the president said, explaining 
why the Bulgarian Ministry of the Interior expelled the Russian 
politician from the country. 
  "Had we taken action earlier, it would have created the 
impression of a nervous reaction indicating possibly fear or 
uncertainty on our part," President Zhelev said in reply to the 
question if Zhirinovskiy's expulsion from Bulgaria was not 
belated. "And yet Zhirinovskiy did a very good job, showing what 
he really is; now that he has been expelled, no normal person 
can suspect us of having some other considerations besides the 
actual one. He is an inadequate politician who, wherever he 
goes, is always getting into mischief," the Bulgarian president 
went on to say. 
  Commenting on Zhirinovskiy's intentions to visit Bulgaria, 
possibly in another capacity, next year again, Dr. Zhelev said 
that this would be a political issue which the Bulgarian 
institutions would have to decide. Having been expelled once, 
he may be denied entry next time, Dr. Zhelev said. 
  Invited to say what his reaction would be should 
Zhirinovskiy 
win the Russian presidential election, Dr. Zhelev said: "There 
is a lot of time until the presidential election, and in the 
meantime the Constitution may change, there may be a number of 
other elections, parliament may also change." Dr. Zhelev did 
not rule out the possibility of the LDP reacting negatively to 
its leader's statements. 
  Commenting on Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's statement that 
Bulgaria 
should regain Aegean Thrace and Macedonia, President Zhelev 
recalled that before Zhirinovskiy, Hitler also wanted to give 
Bulgaria those lands. The Bulgarian president described this 
statement as funny because "he brought down a peg or two certain 
Balkan politicians who have been trying to counter some sort of 
local education based on Christianity, Eastern Orthodoxy, 
Pan-Slavism and other anachronistic ideas to Europeanism, 
Eurocentrism and the Euro-Atlantic structures." The path to 
follow is unification with Europe, becoming an integral part of 
Europe, and not inventing local structures like the ones we have 
already had, but they all came to nothing," Dr. Zhelev stressed. 
However, responding to another question, he said that NATO 
could continue its existence only by turning into a system of 
collective security, "otherwise sooner or later this will lead 
to the establishment of other regional groups, blocs and 
alliances because none of the former socialist countries has 
reliable foreign political and military guarantees for its 
security at the moment." 
  President Zhelev expressed his opinion that the LDP leader's 
statements will by no means influence Bulgarian-Russian 
relations or, if they have some effect, it will be rather 
positive. 
  According to the Bulgarian president, what matters is not 
Zhirinovskiy as an individual but Zhirinovskiy as a phenomenon 
emerging in most Central and East European countries as a 
logical consequence of the difficulties they face in the period 
of transition. Zhelyu Zhelev, who wrote the book "Fascism" and 
was awarded a Ph.D. degree for his dissertation on the 
totalitarian state, expressed his fears that having won over the 
masses with demagogic promises and coming to power, such an 
individual would replace demagogy with dictatorship. 
  In my view, now that we are building democracy at the end 
of the 20th century, our democracy has no right to be naive and 
helpless as liberal democracy was at the beginning of the 
century when it was so easily usurped by totalitarian 
adventurers, the president said. In his opinion, "democracy at 
the end of the 20th century should have all the antibodies 
needed to counter all possible mutants and relapses of 
totalitarianism -- both of a fascist or communist type." 
  "Producing those antibodies is a must and I think we will be 
compelled to produce such antibodies to counter any possible 
relapses of totalitarianism," Dr. Zhelev stressed. 
  The president said that the prosecutor's office in Bulgaria 
should take action against Vuzrazhdane, a recently established 
ultra-right organization led by Father Georgi Gelemenov who 
declared his intention to persecute Gypsies and Bulgarian Turks. 
"I think that the prosecutor's office should have taken action 
against Gelemenov long ago because his statements run counter to 
the Constitution, they are an open incitement to subversion and 
violation of human and minority rights which is impermissible in 
a democratic society," President Zhelev said, adding that "the 
constitution, they are an open incitement to subversion and 
violation of human and minority rights which is impermissible in 
a democratic society," President Zhelev said, adding that "the 
prosecutor's office should act very quickly and categorically."

<F P=106> [From BTA's 30 December "Press Review"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Sofia, December 30 (BTA) -- [passage omitted] 
"President Zhelev Calls Zhirinovskiy `fascist'," (STANDART NEWS 
daily,) "President Says Why Zhirinovskiy Was Kicked Out," 
(OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK daily), "Zhirinovskiy Leaves, President 
Zhelev Compares Him to Hitler, Doubts If He Will Be Let Into 
Bulgaria Again," (the KONTINENT daily): Under these and similar 
headlines today's newspapers coverage of President Zhelev's 
statements on the visit here of the leader of the Russian 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. The 
newspapers detail the last hours of Zhirinovskiy's visit here. 
He left for Moscow by a scheduled flight at 14:20 p.m. local 
time. "The interior minister's order for Zhirinovskiy's 
expulsion was unnecessary, stupid and leaves open the question 
about the real motives. It also is indicative of a temper 
lost," runs a commentary in KONTINENT daily, adding that "talks 
with Zhirinovskiy should have been held only by force of 
argument, or no comments should have been made at all -- just 
the way the president had reacted in the case of U.S. Ambassador 
William Montgomery's statements," an editorial commentary in 24 
CHASA blames the president's advisers for having invited only 
foreign correspondents and reporters of "selected Bulgarian Mass 
media" to hear Dr. Zhelev's remarks yesterday. 
  The trade union daily TRUD runs an interview with Svetoslav 
Stoilov whom Zhirinovskiy proclaimed as the future president of 
Bulgaria. Asked if he really believed he was going to be the 
next president of Bulgaria, Stoilov said, "Me, a Bulgarian 
president? This statement is offending me. I am going to be 
president of the Balkans (of all countries on the Balkan 
peninsula). A severe cataclysm is due in Bulgaria. We will 
throw all the present parties into the Black Sea. The plan is 
ready." Interviewed for the Socialist Party daily DUMA, the 
leader of the Bulgarian Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Veselin 
Koshev says that before leaving Bulgaria Zhirinovskiy had 
declared he would come back here as president of Russia. Koshev 
says that the Bulgarian LDP invited Zhirinovskiy to visit 
Bulgaria again in March or April next year, and a delegation of 
LDP will visit Moscow in January. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of Russia's </F>
Liberal Democratic Party, by Vasko Gigov; place and date not 
given: "The Main Thing Is To Change Bulgaria's Political 
Leadership"] 
  [Text] [Gigov] What, according to you, is the state of 
Bulgarian-Russian relations today? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] We think that Bulgaria must be a key country 
in the Balkans and that Macedonia and Thrace could be ceded to 
its territory. They are ancient Bulgarian lands. However, the 
main thing for us is the fact that the country's political 
leadership must be changed. Your current president, Zhelyu 
Zhelev, is a figure of the transitional period, which is about 
to end. The state leaderships of many East European countries 
are being replaced, and I would like to see Mr. Svetoslav 
Stoilov as your president. I think that this will also be 
beneficial for Russia. Mr. Stoilov is a well-known economist 
and our European consultant on all economic issues. Bulgaria 
needs such a president in the new year. The process of 
stabilizing relations throughout the entire Balkan peninsula 
with the participation of Russia will begin only after he comes 
to power. Then the violent actions and armed conflicts will 
end. Naturally, the help of the UN Security Council 
member-countries is necessary for this. 
  The status quo in Yugoslavia will be preserved and the 
variant of a not very "rigid" federation on the territories of 
former Yugoslavia is possible. The Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes 
will remain in their places and refugees from various republics 
will no longer be mixed. Thus, every possibility of armed 
clashes will be eliminated. 
  I think that this confederation among the Balkan states 
could 
be expanded by the inclusion of Romania and Hungary, but no 
state will have priority. Every nation has the right to live in 
the Balkans and discrimination based on nationality or religion 
is necessary. There have never been Muslims in the Balkans. 
Whoever claims the opposite lies. Slavonic and Christian 
peoples, predominantly belonging to the Eastern Orthodox Church, 
but also Catholics, lived here. The lie about the Muslim nation 
is a pure game on the part of certain centers. 
  This all could be regulated and I think that the new Russian 
parliament, the Duma, will support the Liberal Democratic Party 
plan on peacefully and finally stopping the conflicts in the 
Balkan peninsula. However, for the time being, the main thing 
is to change Bulgaria's political leadership, and I think that 
this will happen soon. 
  [Gigov] Does the Kuril Islands problem exist for you? 
What do you think about the concerns of Poland and Finland with 
your election success? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] All stories that, in my political program, I 
threaten the sovereignty of Poland and Finland are lies. In the 
past, many people said that the CPSU's [Communist Party of the 
Soviet Union's] regime was almost criminal and had to be 
eliminated. However, I, as a jurist, always claimed that I was 
born under that regime, and I do not consider myself a criminal. 
Generally, this was a normal state, but its leadership made 
mistakes. 
  Even at that time, I said that if the West thinks that the 
Russian regime is criminal and must be eliminated, then the 
borders established by that criminal regime must also be 
eliminated and returned to the situation before the October 
Revolution. Now the Finns could ask: What about our 
independence? 
  Look, we do not question at all the fact that Finland is now 
a sovereign state. It was they that raised the issue. They 
became scared. We do not talk about returning Finland to 
Russia. We do not need this. Let Finland be. The same applies 
to Poland. 
  The USSR is another matter. We think that, in the long run, 
Russia's borders could be the borders of the former USSR, but 
this could happen only if the relevant territories, which today 
are viewed as independent, want this. 
  [Gigov] What do you think about the military blocs? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] We oppose them. If the Warsaw Pact was 
dissolved, we think that NATO should also be dissolved as a 
military bloc. However, it is very possible that the East 
European peoples form an economic and cultural alliance with 
Russia, similar to the European Community, without attributing 
any military aspects to this alliance. 
  [Gigov] In certain countries you were described as a 
fascist.... 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Look, I want the entire Bulgarian people to 
understand through you that our party has no relation to fascism 
or communism. We are a moderate centrist party with a 
liberal-democratic program. Now, in the former USSR and the 
former republics, nationalism is the main ideological weapon, 
and in certain regions anti-Russian emotions intensified. 
  We say that various nations should not be opposed to each 
other, because we are against every discrimination. 
Nevertheless, they try to slander us and say that we support 
Russian nationalism. We say that Russia is the motherland for 
all and that we oppose the idea of restoring the USSR and CIS. 
We support the existence of a Russian state, a great Russia, 
but as a motherland for all nations that live on its territory. 
It is their common motherland as a geographical entity. And 
what are they trying to do? They try to prove with their tales 
that we are Russian nationalists, that we want a pure Russian 
state, and so on. 
  We do not want this, and since they had no arguments to 
oppose us, they decided to use lies. Lies became their 
political weapon. 
  [Gigov] How do you think that the conflict in former 
Yugoslavia will be resolved? Do you think that Mikhail 
Gorbachev is responsible for this conflict? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Gorbachev is the main culprit of everything 
bad that happened in the USSR and East Europe, and which began 
in April 1985. In December 1991, he himself understood that he 
made a mistake and resigned. However, I think that the period 
of transition in Russia and East Europe ended and that, soon, 
new political leaderships will come to power in those countries. 
Conditions of lasting peace and democracy for all, rather than 
for a nation of a group of citizens, will finally be established 
in the near future. The man is in the first place. He will be 
even above the state. 
  [Gigov] What is the basic goal of your visit to Bulgaria? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I assumed the commitment to lay a wreath at 
the monument of the King-Liberator [Alexander II] of the Balkan 
peoples, which is in Sofia's center. I will do it on 28 
December at 1500 [1300 GMT], but prior to this, I would want a 
military band of the Bulgarian Army to play a Slavonic march. 
Afterward we will give a news conference for Bulgarian and 
foreign reporters. I will not hide from them. I support the 
free press and I am ready to talk to anyone, as I did in Germany 
and Austria. 
  In addition, I will take the opportunity to meet certain 
representatives of Bulgarian political parties. 
  The basic goal of my visit to several European countries is 
to renew my business contacts and present our party's positions.

  [Text] Sofia, December 31 (BTA) -- "Maybe 1993 was the most 
difficult and painful year of the transition. Many things we 
hoped for did not happen, those which did happen were not always 
done as they should have been, and meanwhile some other very 
important things were achieved ensuring a good start for next 
year," President Zhelyu Zhelev says in his New Year message to 
the Bulgarian nation which will be broadcast on the National 
Television and Radio a few minutes before 1994. 
  According to the president, the possibility of obtaining a 
most favourable settlement of Bulgaria's foreign debt, of 
quickly concluding an agreement with the International Monetary 
Fund, of attracting foreign investments to Bulgaria, of 
receiving compensations for the Bulgarian losses ensuing from 
the Yugo embargo, of completing the restitution of land and of 
carrying out mass privatization are the things that give ground 
to believe that 1994 will mark a turning point in the period of 
transition. We will either make it or will be listed in another 
category of states, Dr. Zhelev says. However, making the 
possible a reality depends on us and first of all on the 
Bulgarian politicians, on their will and efficiency, on their 
ability to place the national interests above their narrow party 
ambitions and their strife for power, President Zhelev believes. 
  Bulgaria is not surrounded by enemies, it is not threatened 
by hostile neighbours, the president says. 
  Addressing the Bulgarian people, President Zhelev wishes 
everybody health, happiness and success in 1994. "May the New 
Year be prosperous, peaceful and successful for Bulgaria," 
President Zhelev says in the end of his New Year message.

  [Text] Sofia, December 30 (BTA) -- A prime-time address by 
Prime Minister Berov called upon Bulgarian people to unite. 
"Society is tired of political strife and wants a calmer life 
and more common sense," the prime minister said. "I will not 
promise you a bright future, but as a nation and a state, we 
have to break clear from our past," he went on to say. 
According to Prof. Berov, the National Assembly bears inscribed 
the secret for Bulgaria's headway: "Unity Is Strength." 
  Prime Minister Berov summed up the 1993 performance of the 
government which he headed precisely an year ago. He thanked 
the cabinet, which he called "valiant," for its "courage, zeal 
and wisdom." 
  "We worked to further advance the changes that had already 
been launched though there was nobody to applaud us. We did 
everything we could to take this country's ship into calmer 
waters," Prime Minister Berov said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav </F>
Daskalov by Major Spirdon Spirdonov; place and date not given: 
"Government Received Important Support"] 
  [Text] [Spirdonov] What is your assessment of the 
parliament's declaration on expanding cooperation with NATO? 
  [Daskalov] This represents support for the government's 
present activity, because the government has always expressed 
our interest in joining the European and Euro-Atlantic 
structures. We will now work even more actively. A matter of 
great importance is how the conference of NATO members on 10 
January will end, what decisions they will adopt, whether NATO 
will extend its influence on the East, and whether or not they 
will adopt the U.S. "Partnership for Peace" initiative. Most 
likely, we may expect a favorable outcome, but only then will it 
become clear what rights and commitments the countries to which 
the initiative is addressed will have. I cannot make any guess 
now. 
  [Spirdonov] Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Avdeyev assured 
Prime Minister Lyuben Berov that there is no danger of tension 
in the two countries' relations. He made this assessment 
immediately following the vote on the parliamentary declaration. 
Do you admit the possibility of any problems arising in 
bilateral relations, perhaps at a later date? 
  [Daskalov] The North Atlantic Alliance will do nothing that 
disregards Russia's interests. Without Russia, we will find it 
difficult to guarantee European security, and furthermore the 
"Partnership for Peace" initiative is directed at Russia as 
well. I think that our joining NATO cannot become a motive for 
friction between our two states. 
  [Spirdonov] It is still too early to talk about what will 
happen after 10 January, but nevertheless, if the results of the 
NATO forum are to our advantage, what will be the first step 
that our country will take? 
  [Daskalov] We will study how to react to the results of the 
meeting, and I am duty bound to inform the National Assembly 
deputies about it.

  [Text] Sofia, December 29 (BTA) -- President of the 
Republic Dr. Zhelyu Zhelev agreed to receive on January 13, 1994 
Mrs. Madeleine Albright in her capacity as special envoy to 
Bulgaria of U.S. President Bill Clinton, reporters learnt today 
from Dr. Zhelev's foreign policy advisor Kamen Velichkov. 
  Mr. Velichkov specified that the purpose of the visit of 
Mrs. 
Albright, who is U.S. permanent representative to the United 
Nations, will be to brief the Bulgarian head of state on the 
results of the NATO summit due in Brussels on January 10. 
  Mr. Velichkov pointed out that some time ago President 
Clinton sent a message to Dr. Zhelev, expressing his agreement 
and desire to take into account Bulgaria's position on the 
exceedingly important and relevant issue of Bulgaria's bid to 
join the North Atlantic Alliance. 
  In his reply, Dr. Zhelev's advisor said, the Bulgarian 
president agrees to receive Mrs. Albright and reaffirms his and 
this country's principled and reasoned position in favour of 
Bulgaria's cooperation with NATO and its future participation in 
the alliance. 
  One important point in Dr. Zhelev's reply message is the 
fact 
that Bulgaria became the first country in Eastern Europe whose 
legislature took a stand on this pressing issue, which is 
important for all Central and East European countries, Mr. 
Velichkov said. Last week the Bulgarian Parliament voted a 
declaration on cooperation with NATO. 
  The message is part of an ongoing dialogue which started at 
the meeting of the two presidents earlier this year and which 
will continue with the forthcoming visit to Bulgaria by the 
special envoy of the U.S. President, Mr. Velichkov said.

  [Text] Sofia, December 30 (BTA) -- The Ministry of the 
Interior tonight denied a story in the TEMPO magazine of Ankara, 
alleging that members of a Kurdish terrorist organization were 
based in Bulgaria. 
  "The Ministries of Bulgaria and Turkey have signed a 
cooperation agreement and exchange information on the combating 
of terrorism," says a press release of the Interior Ministry 
received at BTA. It stresses that Bulgaria's special services 
have no information on the existence of such an organization in 
this country and have not exchanged information on the matter 
with Turkey. "What the magazine says about there being a link 
between a Kurdish terrorist organization and Iranian drug 
traffickers could be described only as a journalist's 
interpretation unsupported by facts and evidence," the press 
release also says. The story in TEMPO, commented in most big 
Bulgarian dailies today, says the Bulgarian special services 
have found out that PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] members 
have penetrated into Bulgaria after some West European countries 
outlawed them. The story alleges that the PKK was connected 
with one Iraqi and two Iranian drug runners, discovered in a 
recent police check in a Sofia flat, in which one policeman was 
killed. Indeed one police officer was killed on December 6, and 
another died from his wounds in hospital later on, but the 
Bulgarian police reported they had been shot by Iranian drug 
traffickers, shot dead by the police as they resisted arrest. 
  The Interior Ministry also stated it had no information on 
the existence of a Bulgarian-Greek ring which, according to 
ELLADHA SIMERA of Greece, illegally transfers foreign currency. 
Allegedly, it operates through gambling casinos in Bulgaria and 
is connected with senior government officials. "The Interior 
Ministries of Bulgaria and Greece have signed an agreement which 
includes exchange of operative information, so far, however, 
there has been neither information nor inquiries about the 
activities of such a group," says the ministry's press release.

  [Text] The Prosecutor General's Office today handed over 
to the prime minister the materials in which cabinet members are 
accused of corruption. The statement by the Prosecutor 
General's Office reads: 
  Following a preliminary study of the materials, it emerges 
that they do not enable one to establish the presence or 
otherwise of sufficient information on the commission of crimes 
of a general nature. 
  According to the statement, the materials also cannot serve 
as a basis for mounting a preliminary investigation under 
Article 191 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Most of the 
materials received were in the form of xerox copies of letters, 
contracts, and memoranda that did not even bear the signatures 
of the persons who compiled them. The materials also included a 
complaint to Mr. Berov submitted to the Council of Ministers on 
1 October 1993, protesting against acts by officials from the 
Ministry of Trade. However, the document contained no 
information as to whether any official action had been taken on 
the matter or on what was established as a result of the 
complaint. 
  The Prosecutor General's Office hopes that the Trade 
Ministry 
officials in question will carry out their duties by taking 
action on the complaint after studying each individual case that 
it brings to their attention, and that, in the event of 
information emerging on the commission of a crime, they will 
provide specific information to the prosecution service.

  [Excerpt] Sofia, January 3 (BTA) -- [passage omitted] For 
the time being, Ukraine has declined Bulgaria's offer to barter 
coal for electricity, the 24 CHASA daily reports, quoting the 
chief of the Power Engineering Committee Nikita Shervashidze who 
returned from Ukraine at the end of December. Bulgaria will 
start buying coal at considerably higher prices from the 
Republic of South Africa which would most probably raise the 
prices of electricity, Mr. Shervashidze believes. He says that 
the possibilities for setting up a new common power grid among 
Bulgaria, Greece, Slovenia, Croatia, Romania, Serbia and Ukraine 
were discussed in Kiev. Negotiations with Ukraine will continue 
two weeks later, during a visit to Kiev of a Bulgarian 
delegation led by Deputy Prime Minister Valentin Karabashev, the 
private daily STANDART NEWS reports. A commentary in the same 
newspaper says that if the National Electricity Company were 
private, the negotiations would definitely succeed. [passage

has been accepted as suitable for regular functioning. 
  The sixth reactor is now functioning at full capacity. The 
other two reactors -- the second and the fourth -- are also 
functioning at full capacity. The capacity of the 440-megawatt 
first reactor is constantly being increased on the basis of 
tests that are being constantly conducted. At the beginning of 
the week, that reactor was connected to the country's power grid. 
  The 1000-megawatt fifth reactor has been switched off for 
repairs and refueling. It is expected that this reactor will be 
connected to the power grid by the end of January 1994.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ani Parmakasiziyan: "Parliament in 1993"] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, December 28 (BTA) -- Parliament had passed 
74 acts and adopted 74 decisions in 1993, Parliament Chairman 
Aleksandur Yordanov said at the closing of the autumn session. 
The bulk of the acts amend existing ones. MP's failed to 
update social legislation. 
  Parliament also passed a package of the following acts: Tax 
Proceedings Act, Tax Administration Act, Value Added Tax Act. 
Their passing by mid-1993 deprived the exchequer of large 
revenues, the Finance Ministry claims. The restructuring of bad 
credits into a state debt was also stalled. Parliament passed 
it at the end of December. 
  Parliament also passed several agriculture-related acts on 
1993 agriculture financial backup and on 1993/1994 autumn and 
spring agriculture activities financial backup. Tobacco and 
Tobacco Products Act was among the most important 
tobacco-related acts. Tobacco producers protests continued 
despite their passing. 
  MP's also passed the National Police Act at the end of the 
year on the structure and activity of one of the Interior 
Ministry sectors. A bill on the Structure of the Legal System 
was not passed. 
  Debates on the bills often grew into continuous political 
disputes: During the debate on the 1993 Budget Act (introduced 
in late April and passed in early June) during its updating 
increasing budget deficit by 5,470 million leva, during a debate 
on a bill amending the Supreme Judicial Council Act (passed at 
first reading), which, to quote MP's from the Union of 
Democratic Forces (SDS), aimed to remove Prosecutor General Ivan 
Tatarchev and Supreme Court Chairman Ivan Grigorov from their 
posts. MP's had a three-week debate on a SDS MP's proposal on 
declassifying MP's and senior state officials' files. 
  Sometimes the National Assembly would pass important acts 
and 
decisions in the very last days preceding parliamentary recess. 
This was the case with the declaration on Bulgaria's relations 
with NATO passed in late December. In August MP's even cut 
short their summer recess at the request of the prime minister 
to pass the Amendments to the Turnover Tax and Excise Duty Act. 
  Over the past year MP's ratified a number of bilateral 
agreements: with France, Moldova, Ukraine, Italy, Kazakhstan, 
Albania and Poland. Parliament gave the cabinet term to 
negotiate and sign lending agreements with different foreign 
banks. 
  This year saw the ratification of bilateral agreements on 
consolidation and rescheduling of Bulgaria's foreign debt to the 
creditors of the Paris Club. The cabinet was given term to 
negotiate this country's foreign debt to the commercial creditor 
banks. 
  A special sitting of parliament in February commemorate the 
50th anniversary of the deliverance of Bulgarian Jews and the 
death of the Jews from Macedonia and Aegean Thrace in the Nazi 
death camps. The sitting was addressed by Bulgarian President 
Zhelyu Zhelev and Knesset Speaker Shevah Weiss. Italian 
President Luigi Scalfaro, King Juan Carlos of Spain, Council of 
Europe Parliamentary Assembly Chairman Miguel Martines and North 
Atlantic Assembly Chairman Louic Bouvard also addressed the 
Bulgarian Parliament during their visits to this country.

  [Text] Sofia, December 30 (BTA) -- The 64 percent 
inflation apart, the end of 1993 ushered in several important 
events in this country's economic life: The Bulgaria-European 
Union interim trade agreement took effect and an agreement in 
principle on rescheduling Bulgaria's debt to private creditors 
was attained. Parliament passed an act regulating bad credits, 
while the cabinet and the IMF forged a third agreement which 
will in all likelihood be initialed early next year. 
  Production slump continued throughout the year. GDP fell 
short of the 1993-projected 350 thousand million leva. GDP will 
total 270 thousand million leva, the National Statistical 
Institute says. The projected 27 thousand million leva budget 
deficit, or 8 percent of GDP, was exceeded and parliament 
updated the budget at the end of the year raising the deficit by 
5.5 thousand million leva. 
  Trade in 1993 was much lower as compared to 1992 which was a 
successful year for Bulgarian exports, statistics show. The 
Agency for Economic Coordination and Development's annual report 
indicates a $100-150 million export decrease every three months. 
Agricultural exports were half the 1992 level at the end of 
September. There are no major changes in the country's trade 
geography. Bulgaria's trade has three main trends. Nearly 30 
percent is effected with the European Union (EU), another 30 
percent of trade is done with the former Soviet Union and the 
ex-socialist countries with the rest covering other countries. 
The delay in the trade agreement with the EU and the 
Yugoembargo consequences entailed a livening up of trade with 
Greece, Turkey and Macedonia. Economists do not expect miracles 
from the trade agreement with the EU which took effect in 
December. 
  The Privatization Agency, the Ministries of Trade, Industry, 
Agriculture and Construction sold 56 state enterprises 
throughout the year. The Ministry of Trade concluded 30 deals, 
the Ministry of Industry sold six light industry enterprises 
while the Ministry of Construction sold seven construction 
companies. The Sofia Municipal Privatization Agency announced 
55 privatization procedures, held 127 auctions and two tenders. 
Just 40 percent of the other municipalities have started 
privatization. Council of Ministers Privatization Agency's 
Executive Director Mrs. Reneta Indzhova said too many 
institutions had been authorized to sell state property. The 
Privatization Agency sold a total of seven enterprises and 
payment is forthcoming on four of them. The state collected 2.8 
thousand million leva in revenue. 
  Five groups united 53 commercial banks of majority state 
holding throughout the year. The ambitious project of the Bank 
Consolidation Company on a restructuring of Bulgaria's banks 
remained halfway done. The institutionalization of new private 
banks was initiated. Three private projects were granted 
authorization by the National Bank of Bulgaria (BNB), while 
another four are waiting for a bank license. 
  Big private business was united throughout the outgoing 
year. 
In late September, 12 private businessmen met with the 
intention of uniting and have since been known as the G-13. Two 
months later they formally founded the Confederation of 
Industrialists. Soon afterwards, in mid-December, big state 
business established an organization of their own. A total of 
21 state-run companies instituted the association of Bulgarian 
state industry. Foreign trade companies, among which arms 
manufacturers like Kintex and Teraton, are the most important 
members. 
  The national energy system functioned without electricity 
blackouts. Electric power cost was raised on two occasions. It 
went up 15 percent early in the year and another 50 percent in 
May. The cabinet is planning a third 67 percent rise at the 
beginning of 1994. In the credit accord with the World Bank, 
the cabinet pledged to raise the cost to 3.5 cents per kw/h in 
June, 1994, the current price being around 2 cents.

  [Text] Sofia, December 29 (BTA) -- 21.4 percent of 
Bulgarians are unemployed, specialists of the National 
Statistical Institute (NSI) said today, announcing the results 
of a survey of the population's economic activity and the labour 
force conducted for the first time in Bulgaria in September this 
year. It covered 30,000 households chosen at random using 
techniques of the International Labour Organization, thus making 
the survey comparable with similar studies in other European 
countries. The survey cost two million leva, one million of 
them being provided by the state. If three million are raised 
next year, statisticians will be able to conduct several surveys 
of this kind to reveal the dynamics of unemployment in the 
country, Mr. Milcho Mladenov, an NSI department director, said. 
  814,000 people out of a 3.8 million population in active age 
are unemployed, the NSI statistics show. This figure is higher 
than those reported so far because it includes all people over 
15 years of age who are looking for jobs. Practically, the 
group includes 51,000 pensioners and 13,000 learners who would 
like to work. 
  Most unemployed have low educational qualifications: 385,000 
have primary or lower education, 137,000 have finished secondary 
vocational schools, and 44,000 are university graduates. Women 
are more badly hit by unemployment than men. 
  Almost 400,000, or 38 percent, of the unemployed are between 
25 and 44 years of age. Unemployment in the rural areas runs at 
19.5 percent, which is 6 percent higher than the urban centres. 
  55 percent of the unemployed have become redundant as a 
result of staff cuts, 11 percent failed to find themselves jobs 
after finishing their education and 7.8 percent -- after their 
dismissal as conscripts from the Army. 
  63 percent of the unemployed have had no jobs for more than 
a 
year and a half, 14 percent have been looking for job 
opportunities for half a year or a year, only 6 percent have 
been jobless for less than a month.

  [Text] Vidin, December 30 (BTA) -- Over 3 million tourists 
and more than 870,000 vehicles have passed through the Vrushka 
Chuka, Bregovo, Vidin ferry line, and river station border 
crossings in the Vidin area (on the Danube) since January 1993, 
BTA learned from its local correspondent. The river station 
border crossing alone issued 70 entry visas and 8,640 transit 
visas for vessels sailing the Danube. Romanian nationals most 
frequently pass the border into Bulgaria (over 690,000). 
Macedonians and ethnic Albanians rank immediately after with 
320,000, said the regional directorate of the interior chief 
Nikolay Dechev. The authorities of these border crossings 
barred 503 foreigners from entering Bulgaria. A total of 17,620 
Deutsche Marks and $1,250 were collected from fines paid by 46 
foreigners upon their exit from this country on account of 
expired visas. Forty trespassers were caught on Bulgaria's 
western border. 
  Over 2-kilometer lines of vehicles are waiting on the Serb 
side to enter Bulgaria by way of the Bregovo and Vrushka Chuka 
border crossings. Over 7,000 Serb nationals pass daily via the 
border crossings in both directions. Most of them go to Kulata, 
Vidin and Bregovo, which are situated near the border, to do 
their shopping for the holidays. The information that Serb 
citizens will have to pay taxes -- 10 Deutsche Marks per person 
and 50 to 100 per vehicle -- upon exit from Serbia brought about 
a busier passenger traffic. The introduction of exit taxes for 
Serb citizens is unprecedented in the international practice, 
customs officers say. 
  The number of people passing through the two Bulgarian 
border 
crossing doubled after the Serb authorities informed about the 
envisaged taxes, BTA learned from the customs officers on duty.

<F P=106> [Mariyana Barutchieva article: "Capital Market in 1993"] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, January 3 (BTA) -- Bulgaria's capital market 
in 1993 marked a significant development as compared to 1992. A 
great number of new companies emerged. No legislation on stock 
market transactions and securities was passed, but a related 
bill will be drafted and tabled for consideration and adoption 
by the National Assembly. 
  The number of stock exchanges grew from two early last year 
(First Bulgarian Stock Exchange-Sofia and Sofia Stock Exchange) 
to thirteen at the end of the year, while stock-market turnover 
totalled 131 million leva. Shares traded in 1992 at the cash 
market were double the 1992 level, but trade was not monitored 
and no exact figures can be published. 
  Leks Ltd. is the undisputed leader among companies. It 
distributed 89 percent in dividends among its share holders 
which increased the demand for the said securities on the 
capital market. The average stock-exchange share price was 169 
leva with a 100 leva par. 1994-projected dividends were 
officially put at 131 percent by the company's management. The 
company's financial position is stable: Metal and oil re-export 
deals with Russia are among the most lucrative transactions as 
are production investments in the assembly of wrangler jeeps. 
  First Private Bank, instituted in 1990, was ranked second in 
market share. The bank's 1992 dividends were 50.4 percent for 
bearer shares and 46 percent for registered shares. The 1993 
dividend will be several points higher. First Private Bank will 
be among a handful of profiting banks in 1993 which heightened 
the interest in its shares. Last month the extraordinary 
general assembly of share holders decided on a capital increase 
to reach 1,000 million leva, its registered capital being 10 
million leva, which is a significant market portion. The Board 
of Directors has been authorized to negotiate with South Korea's 
Daewoo industrial giant which is interested in the purchase of 
49 percent of the registered shares. First Private Bank will 
cover a World Bank loan for private sector and export funding. 
  Credit Bank, an international multigroup holding bank 
instituted in 1991 with a 50 million leva registered capital, 
was surprisingly ranked third in market traded shares worth 
nearly 14.5 million leva which is due to big sales in May, June 
and September. 
  Another private bank, the Agricultural Credit Bank, with 30 
percent of its capital owned by Austria's Raiffeisenbank 
distributed 50 percent in dividends in 1993, while its share 
prices did not drop below the 2,000 leva mark, the par being 
1,000 leva. 
  The shares of major state-run banks did not sell well in 
1993 
due to huge bad credits and financial performance throughout the 
year. 
  Newly emerged companies opted for real property and 
construction investment: Long-term material assets not affected 
by high inflation. The East-West International Holding, which 
guaranteed a 105-percent dividend in 1993, and TBS Hotels 
constructing the Ambassador-Sofia Hotel with a 150-per cent 
projected dividend, are some of them. Trakiya Commerce, working 
in the field of bakery products, Maxcom Hold, Black Sea 
Investment Fund, Aktiv, and Bulgarian Autotransport Co. have 
elicited investor's interest because of their anticipated 
progress. 
  Investment funds are a novelty. They aim to collect the 
disposable money assets of banks and other potential investors 
and invest them in lucrative projects. The Razvitie 
(development) Investment Fund was ranked top on the stock 
market. The bulk of its transactions relate to immoveables and 
it is also engaged in the construction of a financial centre in 
Sofia. The shares of Suedinenie (unity) Investment Fund, 
dealing with financial investments, also elicited interest.

  [Text] Zagreb, December 30 (TANJUG) -- The Croatian 
Helsinki Committee warned Thursday [30 December] that mass 
mobilization was carried out in the past few weeks in the 
Republic of Croatia of those born in Bosnia-Herzegovina in order 
to send them to the battle fronts in this war-torn former 
Yugoslav republic. 
  A committee statement said several thousand people have 
already been mobilized. They were at the barracks of the 
Croatian Army and wearing uniforms without any insignia. Noting 
that those mobilized were citizens of Croatia, the committee 
noted that the Croatian authorities "did not adhere to 
international provisions" which "most strongly forbid sending 
soldiers of one state to fight in another state." 
  A civil war raged in Bosnia-Herzegovina for more than 20 
months between the local Serbs, Moslems and Croats. The Bosnian 
Croats have from the very beginning been assisted by several 
tens of thousand of troops of the regular Army of the Republic 
of Croatia. The Croatian Helsinki Committee demanded the 
Croatian authorities immediately halt such activities, condemn 
them and promise a thorough and urgent enquiry as well as open 
disciplinary and court proceedings against the officials 
involved. 
  The statement also demanded an enquiry into the fate of all 
the soldiers, Croatia's citizens, sent to Bosnia-Herzegovina 
whose whereabouts were presently unknown, as well as the return 
of all those mobilized and already sent to Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
The committee, as set out, was in possession of documents 
showing that disciplinary measures were taken against the 
soldiers serving in Croatia's Army who have refused to go to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as that they were threatened with 
court-martial. 
  Some of the soldiers who refused to take part in the latest 
preparations for going to Bosnia-Herzegovina "were beaten up at 
the barracks," while others were threatened "to have their 
citizenship certificates taken away and inviting trouble for 
their families," the statement of the Croatian Helsinki 
Committee said.

  [Text] Zagreb, Dec 31 (AFP) -- A convoy carrying about 750 
Bosnian Moslems and Croats civilians out of Sarajevo arrived 
late Thursday [30 December] at the Croatian port of Split, the 
official Croatian agency HINA said. The refugees, mainly women, 
children and elderly, left Sarajevo on Tuesday evening on board 
16 buses. They will be housed temporarily in a sports centre in 
Split, before being transferred to refugee camps or leaving for 
new lives in another country. 
  Many of the refugees had no documents with them, which 
created long hold-ups at the Croatian-Bosnian border, the Croat 
refugee office said quoted by HINA. Bad roads and a spate of 
technical hitches also delayed the convoy's progress. UNHCR 
spokesman Ray Wilkinson said earlier Thursday in Sarajevo: "It 
was not anticipated that it would take so long." 
  Wilkinson said the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 
was going to feed the evacuees before the last leg of the 
journey Thursday from Metkovic on the Croatian border to Split, 
120 kilometres (70 miles) to the north. "These people are 
probably quite hungry, since they had only a few food supplies 
with them when they left Sarajevo on Tuesday," he said. 
  A group of 150 Bosnian Serbs evacuated the same day, heading 
for Belgrade, arrived in Serbia on Wednesday.

<F P=106> [Article by Czech Economy Minister Karel Dyba: "What Will </F>
the 1994 Bring in the Czech Economy"] 
  [Text] If we consider the year 1991 to be the beginning of 
the real transformation of the Czech economy, in January 1994 
the Czech Republic will enter the fourth year of the 
transformation period. 
  The economic policy for 1994 continues with the successful 
economic policy of the previous years. Of course, however, it 
adds some new, growth-promoting accents (cf. highway 
construction, housing policy, etc.). In 1994, the maintenance 
of a balanced budget remains the objective, while the tax burden 
should be relieved. The government policy of a balanced budget 
helps the Czech National Bank, whose task it is to protect the 
stability of the koruna. 
  Economic growth emerges from this background, as a new 
objective for the government that is fully compatible with the 
maintenance of the macroeconomic stability. 
  1994 is the first year in which we can say that all the 
corner stones have been laid, and we should witness the 
completion and finishing touchs to something that already exists 
rather than some new pivotal events. This is the fundamental 
information for the economic sphere, for the dependable 
calculability of investment decisions. 
  I believe that inflation will not exceed 10 percent in 1994. 
That is implied by the long-term trend of the development of the 
month-to-month inflation, which, if we disregard the one-time 
price shocks in 1991 to 1993, hovers within the 0.5 to 1.0 
percent limits. It remains a question, however, whether the 
Czech National Bank should not be more flexible and pump more 
money into the economy. I believe that this approach would be 
compatible with the protection of the stability of the price 
levels and the rate of the koruna. At the same time, it would 
support the growth tendencies on the already sufficiently 
transformed supply side of the economy. 
  The gradual liberalization of prices should continue in 
1994, 
rationed with consideration to the ability of economically weak 
households to bear the price moves. Another price 
liberalization (for instance, rents, transport tariffs, etc.) is 
considered in the context of the completion of the system of 
social subsidies. The price liberalization must not be 
cumulated so as to bring about useless financial expectations. 
  The balanced budget is one of the reasons why the government 
has managed to maintain a stable nominal exchange rate of the 
koruna. With respect to the development in the volume of foreign 
currency reserves, I consider this policy a good one also for 
the coming year, and do not expect any substantial shift in the 
nominal exchange rate of the koruna. 
  Because of the relatively high level of inflation in the 
Czech Republic (in comparison with our West European trade 
partners), the stability of the nominal exchange rate of our 
currency means a gradual strengthening of the competition for 
our domestic producers thanks to imports growing relatively 
cheaper. That is good for the consumer, and the producers have 
to adjust. 
  The government has sometimes been reproached that it does 
not 
adequately deal with the structural policy. I believe that we 
want no such policy in the sense of the selection by the 
government bureaucracy of the victors and the vanquished. On 
the contrary, it is possible that the government would 
facilitate the process of the necessary structural changes by 
general measures such as supporting the retraining of employees 
or -- when necessary -- by selective interventions of the type 
of the restructuring of Skoda Plzen [company]. The condition is 
always that the interested entities, i.e., particularly the 
enterprises and banks, share the costs. 
  It would be too soon to expect in 1994 a substantial 
recovery 
in the advanced market economies, and this will reflect 
negatively on the possibilities of Czech exports. Our 
manufacturers marked an exceptional success in export 
performance in 1993. The pace of growth of exports reached 
double-digit values at a time when competition on the world 
markets increased because of the economic recession. 
Nevertheless, I believe that, under the present economic 
conditions, even a deficit trade balance would be compatible 
with the external balance, given a surplus trade in services and 
a continuing flow of investments from abroad. One has to bear 
in mind that if the trade balance shows a deficit because of a 
high share of machines and equipment in the overall imports (40 
percent in 1993), it will be favorably reflected in the growth 
of the gross domestic product in the next period and in 
long-term exports. 
  Although the unemployment rate in the Czech Republic 
fluctuates substantially from region to region, on average and 
on a long-term basis, it belongs to the lowest in Europe. This 
fact has its positive side (from the point of social peace) but 
also a negative one (from the point of economic effectiveness). 
Anyway, a certain growth is to be expected in the unemployment 
rate in 1994. That is, above all, because of the 
rationalization brought about by the progress of privatization, 
but also as a result of the effect of the law on bankruptcy and 
settlement. Under no circumstances, however, would I expect any 
dramatic shifts in the unemployment rate. I am not even calling 
for bankruptcies. I believe that in the instance of 
bankruptcies, we bear witness to the process of learning while 
working. Wherever a bankruptcy is the best solution to the bad 
situation of the enterprise, sooner or later it will come to it. 
I would really like it though, if the courts worked better in 
the bankruptcy proceedings and that the court decisions were 
more easily executable. 
  The small-scale privatization is practically completed, the 
large-scale one will continue in 1994, among other things, 
through the second wave of coupon privatization. A further 
dynamic development can be expected on the capital market, which 
has been operating smoothly for almost a year both at the Prague 
Exchange and within the framework of the RM-system. 
<H3>  The share of the private sector in the economy will continue 
to grow. </H3>
  The volume of both direct and portfolio investments from 
abroad will also grow. The growth of foreign investments 
together with foreign loans (both state and private) will 
result, in 1994, in a further increase in foreign currency 
reserves. The ability of the economy to produce a sufficient 
volume of foreign currency is a prerequisite for introducing the 
regime of full convertibility of the koruna, which has become a 
topic of specific talks in banking circles. 
  If, in closing, I were to briefly summarize my expectations 
regarding the economic development in the Czech Republic in 
1994, I would say the following: The economic transformation is 
moving in the right direction. In this respect, the Czech 
Republic belongs to the best among the postcommunist countries. 
This fact should become even more apparent in the next year 
that it has been so far. I do not expect any dramatic jumps, 
internal or external, which could threaten our economic 
development. 
  Of course, we must not underestimate the fact that 50 
percent 
of our gross national product is produced for export. The 
merciless struggle for the place in the sun will continue on the 
world markets next year. The managers, whose performance is not 
up to par, should realize this fact. If they do not realize it 
in time, I hope that the enterprise owners will replace them 
soon. 
  Overgrown bureaucracy, tying up enterprise with numerous 
superfluous regulations, could also become a threat to healthy 
economic development next year. Let us learn from the negative 
experience of others, including the European Union countries. 
  A healthy economic development can only take place under the 
conditions of social peace. On the other hand, the healthy 
economic development itself creates conditions for maintaining 
the social peace. The diversification of income is a desirable 
driving force of the economic growth. The economic growth, 
however, opens the path to a higher living standard, also for 
those whose wages grow the slowest. The future prosperity is in 
our hands.

<F P=106> [Article by Richard Salzmann, chairman of the board and </F>
director general of Komercni Banka: "What Will the 1994 Bring 
in the Czech Economy"] 
  [Text] I assume that the continuing development of the 
private sector, which had better results than the state sector 
already this year, will bring with it a tendency to a gradual 
growth of the gross national product. A production growth, 
however, can be expected only in some branches of industry (i.e. 
consumer goods, chemicals, wood-processing, and some areas of 
mechanical engineering) and in construction. On the other hand, 
a further decline is likely in coal mining, metallurgy, and 
agriculture. We can again expect imports to grow faster than 
exports. This is a result of the growth of personal and public 
consumption and the demand for investments arising from the 
necessary change of the production basis. This deficit will be 
probably covered by a surplus of services in the balance of 
payments, which, as a whole, will be balanced. 
  Our economic development will be favorably affected next 
year 
particularly by the following: 
  -- a continuing stability of the currency 
  -- a substantial decline in the rate of inflation 
  -- the interest of private owners in good management 
  -- a recovery of demand (a moderate increase in personal 
consumption and investment activities on the domestic market and 
the possibility of placing Czech goods on some foreign markets) 
  -- social peace and, in comparison with other countries, a 
relatively low rate of unemployment 
  -- budget stability 
  -- an increased interest of foreign capital in investing in 
the Czech Republic. 
  On the other hand, the ongoing recovery process in our 
economy will apparently bring also some negative trends, for 
instance: 
  -- pressure for a growth of wages faster than that of social 
productivity 
  -- a high insolvency of companies and enterprises 
  -- the harmful effect of bankruptcies on business partners 
of 
the bankrupt enterprises, i.e. also on banks 
  -- a regional disparity of certain phenomena, such as 
unemployment, for instance. 
  Of the foreign influences, in addition to the, on the whole, 
already compensated-for losses of the markets in the former 
socialist camp, we can be unfavorably affected, above all, by 
the following: 
  -- the certain uncertainty in the future development of the 
economic relations with the Slovak Republic 
  -- the surviving protectionist efforts of the economically 
advanced countries 
  -- the continuing economic stagnation in the countries of 
our 
most important trade partners, demonstrated not only by the 
closing of their domestic markets, but also by their intent 
interest in third markets. 
  The gradual liberalization of some more prices (rent, power, 
etc.) can combined with the growing unemployment reflected in 
the decline in the pace of growth of the purchasing power of the 
population, and, in extension, effect the deposits by the 
population and thereby the bank resources. That could weaken 
the activity of the banking sector -- credits, capital market 
operations, etc. Thus, the interest of the banks in domestic 
primary deposits will grow, and the banks will seek funds 
abroad. This will increase the importance of audits of bank 
balances according to international standards as a token of 
their reliability for foreign partners. 
  The basic systemic measures of the transformation have been 
adopted. Next year, we expect the government to fine tune the 
conditions for the support for the growth of the economy as, for 
instance, exports advancement law, tax adjustment, details of 
the legislative conditions for the entry of foreign investors, 
the drafting of housing market legislation, etc. The work will 
continue on the prerequisites for the external convertibility of 
the Czech koruna, and both more radical avenues and slower 
gradual steps will be investigated. We expect an amendment to 
the law on banking, which will facilitate the development of 
other types of banking operations (mortgage loans, for 
instance). The ongoing privatization, with the emergence of 
stockholding companies, will put great demands on the perfection 
of the capital market with securities. Many of the shareholders 
(there are several million of them in the Czech Republic) will 
gradually start trading either on the exchange or on the 
RM-system. 
  The reduced inflation will result in pressure on reducing 
the 
interest rates. Over the next two years, the interest rates on 
the Czech banking market will gradually adjust to the rates in 
the advanced countries. It is, together with other 
prerequisites, one of the steps the banking sector must take in 
preparation for a possible entry of the Czech Republic into the 
European Community. 
  What are then the tasks of the Komercni Banka [Commercial 
bank] for the next year? 
  We want to keep and reinforce our position as a leading 
Czech 
universal bank, and that while fully respecting the 
legislatively defined monopoly limits. We must complete the 
organizational and technical restructuring, began three years 
ago, to a standard modern European bank, and so improve the 
services to our customers. We will enhance the extent of our 
business activities, in credits as well as in trading on the 
capital and financial markets. We will, above all, expand 
credits for the private sector. For selected, superior 
projects, we have prepared a so-called KB PRO program with 
better credit conditions (substantially lower interest rates, 
lower collateral required, etc.) and, at the same time, with 
demanding criteria for assessment of these projects. We intend 
to more than double the trade in securities, and we will 
continue to expand the operation on the interbank market. To 
improve the situation in resources, we will expand our offer of 
deposit products, particularly the term deposits, so we satisfy 
the demands of our customers to the utmost. We are also 
preparing another bond issue. 
  The possibilities of the development of the business 
activities of the Komercni banka are limited by its capital as 
assessed by the index of capital adequacy [kapitalove 
primerenosti] set by the Czech National Bank. Therefore, we 
have decided to raise the bank's capital from the original 5 
billion korunas at the end of 1992 to at least 9.5 billion 
korunas in 1994. We are conducting this increase in two steps -- 
first, by an increase of 2.5 billion korunas from the equity 
ratio, and second, by a new issue of shares in the nominal value 
of 2 billion korunas. The talks on the preparation of the new 
issue indicate a great interest of the current shareholders as 
well as of the selected foreign investors. This interest is 
given, among other things, by the fact that the price of KB 
shares listed on the market show a mostly advancing trend and is 
a multiple of the nominal value. 
  The Komercni banka intends to continue in the policy of the 
lowest interest rates on credits, while keeping the 
corresponding real level of interest on deposits. In practice, 
this means another decline in the bank margin. 
  The Komercni banka has founded a home ownership saving bank 
and is preparing a mortgage bank as subsidiaries. Thus, it 
intends to fill the voids in the banking services in the Czech 
Republic. The home ownership savings and the mortgage loans may 
contribute significantly to the development of the Czech economy 
by stimulating the demand for construction, but also for the 
industry manufacturing needs for the construction and equipment 
of housing etc. 
  I believe that the banking sector in general and the 
Komercni 
Banka in particular will make another step in 1994 towards an 
increase in both the number and quality of financial services 
that are necessary for the development of a healthy market 
economy.

  [Text] Prague, Dec 28 (CTK) -- Some 25,000 foreigners with 
permanent and long-term stays are living in Prague, Zdenek 
Sykora, a Prague police official told journalists today. The 
figure includes nationals of 136 countries, "ranging from 
Afghanistan to Zimbabwe," Sykora said. 
  The inflow of Chinese has declined, while the number of 
immigrants from the former Soviet Union has been on the rise, he 
reported. They often work without residence and labor permits. 
"They arrive in the Czech Republic, as to a blessed country, in 
order to earn money here," he added, and noted that the 
employers, too, are punishable for hiring illegal workers. 
  The latest problem are Tunisians, Sykora said. During 
foreign police round-ups, when foreigners are checked, some 70 
percent of the detained are from Tunisia. These people are 
usually heading for the West, he reported. 
  Sykora called nonsense the allegation that 30,000 Americans 
were living in Prague. He explained that according to the 
current estimates, about 80 million foreigners had arrived in 
the Czech Republic this year. If they come from the States of 
visa-free contact with the Czech Republic, they can stay here 
for 30 days with no registration necessary. Therefore, it is 
not possible to estimate the number and nationality of people 
staying in the Czech Republic illegally.

  [Text] Prague, Dec 30 (CTK) -- The clearing balance in 
trade between the Czech and Slovak Republics is coming close to 
6 billion Czech crowns [Kc] (about $200 million) at the end of 
this year, Ondrej Kvacek from the Czech National Bank informed 
CTK today. The new block stands at Kc4.25 billion and the old 
block (before the currency separation on February 8) at Kc1.50 
billion. The two clearing accounts were set up on February 9, 
1993 when the first payments on the old block were cleared. 
Payments on the new block began February 15. The Czechoslovak 
currency split on February 8. 
  Transfers from the old to the new block took place in 
mid-May 
and mid-August, and at the end of September, October and 
November. Compensation of the marginal credit was done in the 
middle of August. The marginal credit amounts to 130 million 
clearing European Currency Units. If exceeded, a foreign 
exchange settlement has to follow. At present the balance is 
nearest to the marginal credit (127 million).

  [Text] Belgrade, Dec 30 (TANJUG) -- Inflation in Yugoslavia 
in December alone will stand at one million percent, the Federal 
Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday [30 December]. Retail 
prices will be 1,790 times higher than in November, and living 
expenses will increase 2,839 times. 
  The draconic sanctions which the U.N. Security Council 
imposed on Yugoslavia in late May of 1992 have resulted in 
severe shortages of goods, a monetary chaos and general 
impoverishment of Yugoslavs the majority of whom now live on a 
subsistence level.

  [Text] Belgrade, December 30 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Prime 
Minister Radoje Kontic has asked the general director of the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) to dispatch a mission to 
Yugoslavia to acquaint itself with the government's 
anti-inflationary programme and a monetary system reconstruction 
programme prepared for January 17. Letters with the same 
content were sent on Wednesday to the president of the World 
Bank amd the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development. Kontic wrote that inflation of more than 20 
per cent a day was causing the withdrawal of goods, services and 
factors of production from the market. 
  The government is aware of the urgency of stabilizing the 
national currency and putting the financial system back on its 
feet in order to save the economy, he wrote. The inflation is 
especially hard on the sick and the poor, Kontic wrote. The 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is hit by the world's highest 
inflation as a result of international economic sanctions 
imposed 19 months ago. Production is paralyzed, imports and 
exports are banned, and the country's assets are frozen in 
foreign banks. Retail prices rose by more than 20,000 per cent 
in November alone. 
  Kontic invited an IMF mission to visit Yugoslavia any time 
before January 14. The start of monetary reconstruction is 
scheduled for January 17. The government has requested the UN 
Sanctions Committee to take action to release Yugoslavia's 
assets abroad (National Bank reserves and commercial bank 
deposits), Kontic wrote. These funds would be used to prop up 
the national currency and soften the transition from 
inflationary financing to an economy backed by a sound currency, 
he wrote. The initiative for these activities was given by 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Kontic wrote. 
  A team of experts has advised Kontic to start monetary 
reconstruction on January 17 even if his request is turned down 
by the international institutions concerned. The experts 
estimate there will be a deficit of some 800 million [figure as 
received] during the first half of the year. The deficit, they 
say, could be covered by releasing the foreign currency reserves 
of the National Bank and commercial banks. This could be done 
by lifting the sanctions or finding other ways of giving 
Yugoslavia access to these funds.

  [Text] Behind us is not only a difficult year of great 
self-sacrifices and great efforts but also of a great solidarity 
in the realization of the vital interests of our country, all 
citizens of Serbia, and our nation. In the past year, we 
managed to create the conditions for achieving a just solution 
to the Yugoslav crisis. We succeeded in this because our policy 
has been just and based on the inalienable right of our country 
and our people to protect their historical, state, and national 
interests but also based on the principle of respecting the same 
rights of other peoples. 
  Today, no one -- neither throughout the former Yugoslavia 
nor 
in the world -- can deny Serbia, its citizens, and the Serbian 
people their persistent and lasting endeavor for peace. We can, 
therefore, freely say that we quite justifiably expect that the 
coming year will bring a lasting and just peace. 
  Great mobilization for work and economic recovery are 
awaiting us in the new year. We expect the implementation of a 
comprehensive economic program, on which we have been working 
for some time and whose preparations have been carried out and 
completed in the last few days, to commence at the beginning of 
the year. This program aims to curb inflation, stimulate 
production, make public expenditures and social policy rely on 
realistic sources of funds, and eliminate speculations. 
  Everyone will have to bear some of the responsibility. This 
equally refers to the governments at the federal and republican 
levels, businessmen, trade unions, workers, peasants, and all 
citizens. Under such conditions, our economic recovery will be 
possible, and this is why resolving the amassed problems of our 
economy will be focused on next year. 
  Along with the struggle for economic recovery, we will fight 
a merciless battle against all forms of crime, because crime is 
incompatible with the nature of a free and democratic society. 
Serbia and its citizens and the entire Serbian nation have great 
potentials for a successful economic and cultural development. 
Next year will be crucial for the quick realization of these 
long- term aims. 
  I wish you all much success and a happy New Year.

<F P=106> [Article by Veselin Simonovic, Miroslav Mikuljanac, and </F>
Vukan Simonovic: "Everyone Together or No One at All!"] 
  [Text] Ten days after the elections it is certain that the 
Serbian citizens have failed to live up to the expectations of 
the Serbian president who had hoped that his party would win an 
absolute majority and would form a government without any 
problems. The Socialists hope that, although relative victors, 
Slobodan Milosevic will give them the mandate. This will 
probably happen, since none of the opposition parties have 
expressed the desire to form a party [stranacka] government or 
even a coalition government. 
  All parliamentary parties have also announced that they 
would 
not support a Socialists' minority government. Zoran Djindjic, 
chairman of the Executive Council of the Democratic Party [DS], 
is the only one currently proposing a solution that could 
perhaps save the day. His proposal to form a government of 
national salvation (in which neither the mandator nor the 
majority of the ministers would be from the Socialist Party of 
Serbia [SPS]), has been decisively rejected only by the SPS and 
the Radicals. If the Socialists continue to insist on ruling 
alone, all the opposition leaders foresee new elections as early 
as spring. 
  According to constitutional procedure, the new parliament 
should meet 20 days after the final electoral results are 
announced. In the meantime, the president of the republic 
should appoint a mandator for forming the government, after 
which the deputies would have two months to discuss the forming 
of the new government. If they are unable to do this within the 
allotted time limit, the assembly is automatically dissolved and 
new elections are held. 
<H5>  "The Montenegrin Recipe" </H5>
  The Socialists announced their electoral victory as early as 
the electoral night of 19 December, after which they announced 
that they would form the new government alone. The euphoria, 
however, did not last long, and, just a few days after Ivica 
Dacic's statement that the SPS would not form a coalition with 
anyone, they sobered up and announced the "Montenegrin recipe." 
Yesterday Dacic said that the Socialists might offer a 
ministerial department or two to everyone except the Radicals. 
  Since all the parties have stated that they do not wish to 
be 
part of a Socialist government, the SPS might employ another 
maneuver, and, under the pretext of an expert government, win 
over certain opposition parties. According to Dacic, however, 
this is in Slobodan Milosevic's domain and not the SPS's. 
  For the time being, the SPS is still considering a mandator 
from its own ranks. The names that have come up are those of 
Dragan Tomic, manager of Simpo, Oskar Kovac, Zeljko Simic, and 
even Radoman Bozovic. In case this is not accepted, the SPS 
might consider a new Panic, or Zoran Djindjic, as the "least of 
opposition evils." 
  The Socialists have lately been toying with the possibility 
of securing the necessary three votes with the deputies from 
ethnic minority parties. The coalition of the two Albanian 
parties from southern Serbia has decisively denied the 
possibility of supporting the SPS. Moreover, the Socialists 
will not get the three votes from the Democratic Community of 
Vojvodina Hungarians [DZVM]. Caba Sepsej, DZVM vice president, 
said for BORBA: "I personally think, and I believe that this 
opinion will be accepted by my colleagues from the party, that 
we are not the ones who should make decisions about the 
government in Serbia. This is an issue that should be solved by 
the parties of the majority people. We are, of course, always 
in favor of democratic options, the end of the war and 
integration into European trends, yet it seems we have no 
influence over any of this. The majority people's parties are 
unanimous in this, just as they are in relation to minorities." 
<H5>  Djindjic Is Ready </H5>
  Some opposition parties see Zoran Djindjic as being the 
"savior" of the Socialist majority. In a statement to BORBA, 
Djindjic decisively rejects the possibility of DS deputies 
supporting a minority government of the Socialists or any other 
coalition government in which the Socialists would have the 
majority. 
  In order to have a capable and efficient government, which 
we 
have not had so far, it has to be trusted by the majority of the 
parties in the parliament. Parties that wish to form a party 
government do not respect the will of the people and show that 
their only goal is power. 
  The greatest responsibility lies with the largest party, 
adds 
Djindjic. First of all we need to establish the concept of the 
new government and find the smallest common denominator, which 
at the moment is solving the basic problems of the people. If 
this were the new government's program, every party would 
support it. In order to form a government of national salvation 
everyone should take a step back from party interests in favor 
of national interests. I am ready to support such a government 
even if not a single one of our members is in it, claims 
Djindjic. He also stresses that he is ready to take on the 
responsibility and role of mandator of such a government. In 
response to accusations of SPS leaders that he is courting the 
Socialists, Djindjic says that this is illogical and strange, 
even for Seselj, who is known for his "strange logic." "If I am 
proposing a solution that will end the SPS's monopoly on power, 
I fail to see how this could be interpreted as courting the 
Socialists. The SPS must be ready to make the greatest 
sacrifices," says Djindjic. 
<H5>  Discontinuity of Power? </H5>
  The new DS leader hopes that he will win the support of the 
Democratic Movement of Serbia [Depos] and the Democratic Party 
of Serbia's [DSS] support for such a government: "with the 
exception of cadre issues, they cannot have a different approach 
from us. A discontinuity of power must occur. A moderate 
variant of such discontinuity is possible only with a government 
of national salvation." 
  However, the other political power in Serbia -- Depos -- 
does 
not expect the president of the state to give them the mandate, 
and it seems that they also do not believe in the possibility of 
a coalition government of everyone with the exception of the 
SPS. Commenting on the proposals currently in circulation, 
Serbian Renewal Movement [SPO] spokesman Ivan Kovacevic said 
that he did not believe that anyone would vote for an SPS 
minority government, but he does not reject the possibility of 
discussing a government of the type proposed by the DS. 
  Two years ago we proposed a government of national 
salvation. 
Such a government should primarily create conditions for the 
first democratic elections. Such a government cannot be formed 
by the SPS and they cannot have the majority in it. 
  The DSS is convinced that the government will be formed by 
the SPS. That is a certainty, says Milorad Jovanovic, DSS 
spokesman, just as it is certain that the opposition will be 
against this government. Deputies of minority parties and 
perhaps some other parties could secure the majority for the 
SPS. The DS has, for example, showed the most affinity for such 
a possibility, whereas the DSS is the last one on the list of 
those who could agree to something of the kind. The SPS is in 
dire need of support, but judging by everything it does not have 
the possibility of forming a stable government, says Jovanovic. 
<H5>  Is a Parliamentary Crisis in View </H5>
  The Serbian Radical Party [SRS] is convinced that the 
electoral results will lead to new elections. Vojislav Seselj, 
president of the SRS, says that there will be no support for an 
SPS minority government, but he also does not believe in the 
possibility of an opposition government or a government of 
national salvation. In response to what the Radicals role in 
this situation is, Seselj said that "we will continue along our 
path; we will neither support the SPS, nor will we oppose them 
in coalition with the DZVM." 
  Rumors that Milosevic will soon summon for consultations all 
party leaders with the exception of Vojislav Seselj testify to 
the fact that the Socialists will try to win over other parties 
for their "expert government." Milorad Jovanovic (DSS), 
however, believes that the SPS is not ready to look for a 
coalition partner and that is why he foresees "new elections, 
new hassles, and finally, the SPS deputies' loss of even the 
relative majority in the assembly. The current 123 will boil 
down to a realistic 80 to 90 mandates," says Jovanovic. 
  Ivan Kovacevic (Depos) also does not foresee a stable 
parliamentary future. "What will follow is a brief 
parliamentary crisis and new elections in the spring." Djindjic 
says that the only salvation for the Socialists' government 
would be for the parliament never to hold a session and to be 
dissolved immediately. In that case, the elections would take 
place as early as May. The Socialists probably expect that the 
sanctions will be lifted in the meantime, which could be an 
electoral point for them. Not all citizens will live to see 
that, and those that do survive will not be aware that elections 
are taking place, says Djindjic.

throughout the territory of Serbia, the information center of 
the Belgrade public railway transport enterprise announced this 
evening. 
  There are no details in this laconic statement, which 
contains only one sentence, about the ending of the strike that 
has been going on since the day before yesterday in the 
afternoon, nor about what was agreed between employers' 
representatives and the government on the one hand, and the 
strike committee on the other. One thing, however, is certain: 
This was a particularly "nasty" strike in terms of its 
consequences for thousands of passengers who were unable to 
travel over the holidays and who suffered greatly in waiting 
rooms and on platforms.

  [Text] Belgrade, Dec 31 (TANJUG) -- Miners at Serbia's 
biggest coal mine Kolubara on Friday ended a three-day strike 
after negotiating a settlement with the authorities in the night 
between Thursday [30 December] and Friday. 
  Early on Friday afternoon, the Belgrade city transport was 
back to normal after its workers ended their several-hour 
stoppage. Like the workers in Kolubara, they went on strike 
demanding higher wages and better living standards. The strike 
of the 17,000 Kolubara workers in Lazarevac near Belgrade ended 
after the miners on Friday morning verified the agreement 
reached with the republic's electricity board and the government 
on Thursday night. The strikers demanded to receive their wages 
in German marks because of the galopping inflation which hit one 
million percent in December alone. 
  The disturbances in coal deliveries resulted in the 
suspension of operation of the thermal power plant Nikola Tesla 
in Obrenovac, which produces 50 percent of Serbia's overall 
electricity, due to which the Serbian electricity board started 
with several-hour brownouts on Thursday. Although the miners' 
strike has ended, it is not certain whether power supply in 
Serbia will be back to normal on Friday because of the 
disturbances in coal deliveries and electricity production or 
whether some parts of the republic will celebrate New Year's Eve 
in candlelight. 
  Dissatisfied with low wages, workers in the Belgrade city 
transport struck on Friday morning. The Serbian railways has 
been on strike for several days, along with some hospitals and 
gravediggers in Belgrade. A drastic fall in the living 
standards and record-high hyperinflation have been provoked by 
draconic U.N. sanctions introduced against Yugoslavia in late 
May of 1992. 
  Three-fourths of Serbia's industrial facilities have been 
standing still for months, while the remaining one-fourth 
operate at reduced capacities although they are not on strike. 
The average salary in Serbia is below 15 German marks, while 
one kilo of meat sells for 40 marks.

  [Text] Belgrade, 31 Dec (TANJUG) -- The presidency of the 
Serbian Renewal Movement [SPO] and Depos [Serbian Democratic 
Alliance] demand that the Serbian Government immediately fulfill 
the Kolubara miners demands, a SPO Presidency statement, 
forwarded to TANJUG today, says. 
  In its message of support to the miners, the SPO says that 
"the disgraceful truth is that in todays's Serbia loiterers and 
criminals get rewarded while miners cannot afford a crust of 
bread." 
  "The SPO and Depos resolutely support the view that the 
authorities who cannot secure at least two things: That no one 
in Serbia is hungry and that every citizen's salary is enough to 
feed himself and his family, must be removed," the statement 
says. 
  The Civic Forum's [nonnationalist intellectual group] 
statement, also forwarded to TANJUG, says that "the latest 
events show that the authorities are trying to provoke the 
introduction of a state of emergency." 
  "The strikes by public services of vital importance for the 
functioning of our state and for citizens' lives, such as 
electricity supplies, railroads and local transportation, show 
that the authorities have decided to use these events to justify 
the introduction of a state of emergency," the Civic Forum's 
statement says.

  [Excerpts] Belgrade, 31 Dec (TANJUG) -- Due to the shortage 
of electric power, Belgrade is now divided into only two blocs, 
instead of the previous four -- those having electricity and 
those not. It is not known for how long this situation will 
last; it depends on the resumption of normal coal production in 
the Kolubara complex, Miodrag Simic, the technical operations 
manager of the Belgrade Electricity board said at a news 
conference today. [passage omitted] 
  According to information available to the Belgrade 
Electricity Board it is not certain that the miners will go back 
to work and resume coal deliveries. According to Simic, if the 
power plant in Obrenovac does not resume work, half the Belgrade 
population will have only candles for light during New Year's 
Eve. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [New Year's statement by President Kiro Gligorov to </F>
delegates of People's Assembly; unattributed: "Conditions for 
Economic Revitalization"] 
  [Text] "I would refer to 1993 as the year of accomplishing 
our international legal and political recognition and 
sovereignty. Since 8 April of this year, the Republic of 
Macedonia has been a member of the United Nations. At this 
moment it has been recognized by more than 50 countries, some of 
which are of extreme importance, and the process of recognition 
by others has already been announced. Finally, the Republic of 
Macedonia has become an international reality. It is a new and 
prospective [as published] state in the Balkans, a factor of 
peace in the region." This, among other things, was emphasized 
by Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov in his new year's 
statement to the delegates and numerous guests at the 72d 
session of the Macedonian People's Assembly. He also made a 
review of everything that has been achieved during the past 
year, particularly what lies ahead of us and what our duties and 
obligations are in the year to come. 
  Talking about the current internal situation, President 
Gligorov pointed to the necessity of adopting a stabilization 
program. "That is, probably, the number one issue in 
Macedonia," he emphasized, and stressed reality as the only 
possible way of approaching that subject. According to him, 
reality means starting from the objective economic and social 
situation in which we find ourselves now, from its influence on 
the stability of the country, and the further reinforcement of 
its international position. "The Republic of Macedonia is in 
transition." he pointed out, "and we should make that period 
easier by opting for that which will exact the smallest economic 
and social price of all of us, without exception." 
  The second point of the review by President Gligorov within 
the framework of the stabilization program was the social and 
political security of the country. That is the basis on which 
the future development of democracy and construction of a legal 
state depends. Therefore, in the opinion of President Gligorov, 
besides the indispensable restrictions, the program should also 
take into account social endurance and establish a system for 
solving the social conflicts. In this context, he stressed the 
need for a speedier establishment of the judiciary system, 
because, in his words, it has a direct impact on the entire 
social and political stability of the state. 
  President Gligorov also said that "it is of special 
importance for us to create an economic, social, and political 
milieu that will guarantee the stability of interethnic 
relations in Republic Macedonia. We have been hearing for three 
years that Macedonia will `without a doubt witness an 
interethnic conflict' and that will be the end of this state. 
But what has reality demonstrated? First, it demonstrated that 
such an interethnic conflict is not unavoidable if we have a 
clear political option, that this is the state and fatherland of 
all those living in it, that the nationalities must enjoy their 
rights, but also respect and perform their duties toward the 
state. Those rights must be realized and solved through 
dialogue, understanding, and political measures within the 
system and its institutions. And second, the realization of 
that unique alternative, as a guarantee to peace and 
harmonization of interethnic relations, is very much dependent 
on the economic and social status of the state." 
  As the last segment on the importance of the stabilization 
program President Gligorov stressed its influence on the 
reinforcement of the republic's international position. "That 
position," he said, "at this moment must, first of all, be 
bolstered on the economic plan and reaffirmed abroad. That is 
our real interest, but also it is in the interest of the 
international community at large. The stabilization and 
economic rise of Macedonia is an important part of that plan. 
Any other choice will either mean pushing the country into a 
hopeless isolation or placing it on the margins of the world 
economic market." 
  Continuing, President Gligorov made a special presentation 
on 
maintaining and reinforcing the security of the Republic of 
Macedonia. "Our republic, today, is on relatively stable 
foundations. However, we do not and must not underestimate 
those possible dangers, particularly because there is a bloody 
war going on in the region. That is why our basic idea is to 
make the Republic of Macedonia an equal member of the collective 
European and world security. The CSCE is the first link. 
However, it is of no less importance for us, in the interest of 
our own security and the security in the region, to be included, 
first of all, in the NATO Council, and then in NATO. It is 
therefore of extreme importance that the Macedonian People's 
Assembly has already come to a firm decision on that," President 
Gligorov emphasized. 
  "The foundations of the sovereign and independent state of 
Macedonia," President Gligorov said furthermore, "were lain on 8 
September 1991. They were reaffirmed by the Constitution of the 
Republic and by the admission to the United Nations. The 
centuries long aspirations and wishes of the Macedonian people 
are our reality -- what we are experiencing today -- an 
independent and internationally recognized state, as a 
continuity of the 1903 Ilinden [the first Macedonian Republic in 
Krusevo], and the 1944 ASNOM [Anti-Fascist Council of National 
Liberation of Macedonia]. Honored delegates, there is no such a 
force that can change all that. Many have tried in the past 
three years, claiming from the outside, that we are `an 
artificial creation', a `communist invention.' For the sake of 
the truth, all those claims have been exhausted. The Republic 
of Macedonia is a respected reality. 
  Allow me, in the end, to express my deep belief that the 
Republic of Macedonia is opening up a new page in its history. 
Its basic orientation will still be an independent state, with 
an open European option, fully integrated in the International 
Community and its security systems; a democratic state in which 
the interethnic relations are and will be regulated by 
international standards; a market economy and full candidacy in 
the world market. 
  That is why, finally, I stress the necessity for the 
People's Assembly and government, as well as for the other 
factors in the republic, to turn to economic and social 
questions, to the stabilization and development of our economy. 
That will ease the transition and create conditions for 
economic revitalization. That will be a thorny road, with 
problems and numerous sacrifices. However, there is no other 
road." 
  Congratulating the orthodox delegates and guests on the new 
year and the Christmas holidays, President Gligorov sent a 
message asking all of us to gather the necessary strength to 
completing that which began with the Declaration of 
Independence, the Constitution, and the realized international 
recognition, in order to leave to the next People's Assembly and 
Government a complete state with all its attributes. 
<H5>  [Box, p 11] </H5>
<H5>  "Main Argument" </H5>
  "The question of the economic survival of the Republic of 
Macedonia is a question of the intensive engagement of many in 
the Balkans. It was always offered as "the main argument", 
saying Macedonia could not survive as a state, because it was 
not able to survive economically on its own. That is why we 
have been exposed to various blockades in the past three years 
since our independence. 
  We demonstrated our ability to maintain our state under such 
conditions, taking into account its economic vitality and 
positive stimuli from privatization. We hear, even today, 
threats to destabilize us through economic measures. 
  However, the most important thing at this moment is for us 
not to allow an economic collapse inside the country, which 
would erode democracy, thus jeopardizing the life and stable 
fabric of our state. There is not one single political goal 
that could justify that," President Gligorov emphasized. 
<H5>  [Box, p 11] </H5>
<H5>  End to Balkan Wars </H5>
  "The question on the dispute over our name has acquired its 
real framework. It has been proven that we do not endanger any 
of our neighbors, and our independence and international 
recognition are not cause for a new Balkan war -- on the 
contrary. We have demonstrated ourselves to be a factor that 
has impeded the expansion of the war to our southern border. We 
demonstrated that the independence of the Macedonian state is 
the key to peace in the south of the Balkans. Through all this 
historical mistakes have been corrected. It, independent 
Republic of Macedonia, put an end to the historical reasons for 
Balkan wars and conflicts; it impeded attempts for another 
division of Macedonia. 
  I deeply believe that knowledge about Macedonia being of 
vital interest for neighboring Greece will become more and more 
widespread. We have many more reasons to fully cooperate as 
good neighbors, instead of creating a new region of conflict in 
the Balkans," President Gligorov said. 
<H5>  [Box, p 11] </H5>
<H5>  Moderation and Realism </H5>
  "The difficult process of our recognition," President 
Gligorov said, "demonstrated that moderation and realism are the 
only possible routes in our foreign policy. It demonstrated 
that it is neither justified to idealize international relations 
and practice, nor to have a completely nihilistic attitude in 
that regard. Reality demonstrated that international relations 
and practice rely on real interests and principles. They can 
neither be idealized nor denied."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Economic Indicators: Conditions in </F>
the Macedonian Economy - 1993"] 
  [Text] The Macedonian economy will round off this year 
with a 14.5 percent drop in production, compared to last year, 
and also, as a result of the insufficient exploitation of the 
production capacities, the productivity of the labor is expected 
to drop 11.8 percent, according to Svetlana Antonovska, director 
of the republic's Bureau of Statistics. 
  The data about the population movements shows that the 
number 
of inhabitants in Macedonia is expected to amount 2,084,000. 
The natural increase in population will note a 1.2 percent 
drop, and total some 17,008 people. The domestic product, per 
capita, calculated according to prices in 1985, will total $687 
in 1993. 
  Analyzed according to branches, the biggest drop in 
production will be recorded in the field of non-metal production 
42.6 percent, the production of leather goods 40.4 percent, and 
the production of non-metal minerals 36.8 percent. Contrary to 
this, high growth will be noted in only four branches, which 
take part in the structure of industrial production with 6.5 
percent. The reduction of the physical volume of the 
agricultural production will total some 22.5 percent compared to 
1992. The personal consumption, measured through retail trade 
sales in 1993, is expected to undergo a drop of 23.3 percent and 
the reduction in the number of shops will total 10.6 percent. 
  According to the previous data about the foreign-trade 
exchange of the Republic of Macedonia, during the first ten 
months, exports totalling more than $855 million have been 
achieved, and the imports total $915 million. Exports are 
covered by the imports with some 93.4 percent, and a deficit of 
some $60 million is appearing. Finished textile products, black 
metallurgy, electric machines, and appliances, comprise the 
major part of the exports, while the priority in the field of 
imports is held by the finished textile products, electric 
machines and appliances, oil derivatives and finished products. 
  The highest reduction in the field of consumption is 
expected 
to be achieved in the field of investments, which will be 
reduced 15 percent. According to the final statistics, this 
year's inflation will be 349 percent and the living costs, 362 
percent. 
  The drop in the level of economic activity brought about a 
4.5 percent drop in employment. The number of people searching 
for work will increase 1.6 percent and reach a level of 174,843 
people. 
  The average net annual wage for 1993 was nominally increased 
+84 percent, and reached an amount of 3,710 denars. It is 
estimated that the increase in wages in the economy sector would 
total 463 percent, and in the non-economy, 536 percent. The 
total number of businesses is expected to reach the number of 
57,721, which is 55 percent more than the situation from 
31.12.1992. The privately owned companies are still the most 
numerous, comprising 93.9 percent.

  [Text] The Slovak Government is disgusted with RFE 
broadcasting. This is what RFE Director Robert Gillette said in 
Bratislava today, adding that this is the real reason for the 
Slovak side's termination of the agreement with RFE. 
  According to Transport and Communications Minister Roman 
Hofbauer and Culture Minister Dusan Svobodnik, whom Director 
Gillette met, RFE broadcasting is biased and is directed against 
the Slovak Government. Gillette said that this was 
unsubstantiated and added that the RFE hoped to reverse the 
Slovak side's decision and conclude an agreement at the next 
meeting scheduled for the end of January.

  [Text] Frantisek Dlhopolcek, director of the Foreign 
Ministry's bilateral contacts department, received the director 
of Radio Free Europe [RFE] Robert Gillette at Gillette's 
request. Robert Gillette briefed Dlhopolcek on the situation 
that has developed as a result of the decision made by Roman 
Hofbauer, minister of transport, communications, and public 
works, concerning the termination of the agreement between the 
former Federal Ministry of Communications and Radio Free Europe. 
During the discussion Frantisek Dlhopolcek said that under the 
totalitarian regime the RFE was a symbol for the Eastern bloc 
states and one of the few sources of free information available 
to citizens living in these countries. But the situation has 
changed since 1989 and that is why we need to seek new forms of 
addressing the listeners. RFE broadcasting should adapt to 
this, too.

DENNIK today. This explains why the SDL has proposed early 
elections, he says. 
  To avoid the crisis in which it had found itself, the 
Movement For a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) formed a coalition 
with the Slovak National Party (SNS). Because its 75 votes are 
exactly half the parliament's total number of seats, the vote of 
no confidence in it cannot be made. However, since it is one 
vote short of a majority, it lacks leverage for pushing through 
certain issues, Kanis says, adding that he believes that the 
process of differentiation within the HZDS is something latent 
and hidden which it might be possible for all to see if members 
of the HZDS group of deputies show the necessary courage. If 
they fail to take initiative, the process might be sparked off 
by the worsening political and economic situation in Slovakia. 
Some deputies from the most deeply struck regions may come 
under pressure from their voters and distance themselves from 
the government, Kanis says in SLOVENSKY DENNIK.

  [Text] Bratislava, Dec 28 (CTK) -- The independent daily 
SME today turns its attention to Slovak Premier Vladimir 
Meciar's proposal, made at an extraordinary cabinet meeting last 
Wednesday, to discuss the compatibility of the 1991 lustration, 
or screening, law with the Slovak Constitution. 
  (The screening law passed by the now-defunct Czechoslovak 
Federal Parliament in 1991 bars former Communist Party 
officials, and members of the former State Secret Police (StB) 
and the People's Militia, from high economic and political posts 
until 1996.) 
  Meciar has asked the Constitutional Court to rule that the 
law runs contrary to the Slovak Constitution. 
  SME carries an interview with chairman of the opposition 
Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) Jan Carnogursky, who points 
out that the law has already been dealt with by the 
Constitutional Court of the former Czechoslovakia, which ruled 
that only two of its provisions contradicted the Constitution, 
primarily the Charter of Fundamental Freedoms and Human Rights, 
which was adopted into the former Czechoslovak Constitution. 
  The Slovak Republic included the Charter into its own 
Constitution without changes, Carnogursky recalls, which means 
that if the Constitutional Court has ruled once on the law's 
compatibility with the Constitution, it should now ignore any 
reservations raised by the Government. 
  Eva Poganyova, a spokesperson for Egyutteles, a Hungarian 
minority movement in Slovakia, says on the same topic that 
Meciar's stance on the lustration issue has been "unclear" since 
1990. She questions the sincerity of Meciar's efforts to 
cleanse Slovak civic and political life of StB agents. 
Poganyova describes the screening law as "imperfect" and 
stresses that it has been a political weapon in the hands of 
those in power from the very beginning. 
  Democratic Left Party (SDL) Deputy Chairman Dusan Dorotin 
says in the daily that SDL reservations against the lustration 
law as a legal norm contradicting the Slovak Constitution are 
generally known. Dorotin says the SDL will support all moves 
aimed at putting the end to the psychosis of collective 
suspicion and at creating an atmosphere of decent respect 
towards the principles of a law-abiding state. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Surany, southwest Slovakia, Jan 2 (CTK) -- Slovaks 
living in southern Slovakia today called on the foreign ministry 
to advise the Council of Europe [CE] of the dangerous precedent 
of creating destabilised areas by recognition of above-standard 
ethnic minority rights. Participants in today's 6th meeting of 
"Slovaks Living in Southern Slovakia" appealed to President 
Michal Kovac and Slovakia's state bodies not to allow a possible 
anticonstitutional contents and consequences of the meeting 
which had been convoked by the Association of Towns and Villages 
of Zitny Ostrov (SMOZO) in Komarno, south Slovakia, on January 
8. The alleged aim of the meeting is to create "a special 
status" (Hungarian minority's) territory in the nationally mixed 
south of Slovakia. According to earlier reports, a 100-man 
assembly is to be elected at the meeting. 
  Most of the 560,000 ethnic Hungarians (11 per cent of 
Slovakia's total population) live in southern Slovakia. The 
appeal also calls for the passage of a law on the protection of 
the republic, a law on the protection of the state language and 
demands that at least one Slovak school be functioning in every 
community, something that ceases to be natural in southern 
Slovakia. 
  The appeal demands that the resolutions in which the Slovak 
Parliament pledged to fulfil the CE recommendations made when 
Slovakia was admitted to the council on June 30, 1993, be 
revised. The recommendations include bilingual road signposts 
in ethnically mixed communities, the possibility to use 
Hungarian first names, and others. 
  A second part of the document calls on ethnic Hungarians not 
to help foment conflicts between the Slovak and Hungarian 
population. The Surany meeting was attended by the deputy 
premiers, Jozef Prokes (Slovak National Party, SNS) and Roman 
Kovac (Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, HZDS), Culture 
Minister Dusan Slobodnik, chairman of Matica Slovenska cultural 
and educational organisation founded in 1863, Jozef Markus, 
deputy chairman of the Democratic Left Party, SDL) Pavol Kanis, 
and HZDS Deputy Chairman Augustin Marian Huska. 
  Speakers at the meeting of 500-600 people expressed Slovaks' 
fears of alleged attempts by the Hungarian parties represented 
in the Slovak Parliament at gradual "ethnic cleansing" of 
southern Slovakia of Slovaks and subsequent revision of the 
state border with Hungary. Kovac stressed that the government 
would not allow any territorial-administrative rearrangement of 
Slovakia on the basis of the ethnic principle which would aim to 
expel Slovaks from newly created micro-regions and would soon 
initiate the conclusion of a treaty with Hungary on the 
inviolability of the state border.

  [Excerpts] The parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee 
considers that the Russian Zhirinovskiy phenomenon does not 
represent a danger for Hungary. The chairman of the committee, 
who is a member of the Socialist Party [HSP], evaluated the 
deputies' work of the year at a news conference. Levente Sukosd 
reports: 
  [Sukosd] In the past year the committee operated as a forum 
for creating political consensus and with good result, said 
Laszlo Kovacs of the HSP, chairman of the committee. [passage 
omitted] 
  In reply to a question, Laszlo Kovacs said that the 
committee 
analyzed the Russian situation not long ago, but no joint stand 
was formulated. The chairman said that in his view, the 
Zhirinovskiy phenomenon did not mean danger for Hungary at 
present, for a strong presidential power prevails in Russia. 
However, we cannot be optimistic in the long term he added, for 
it is not only the grave economic condition which caused the 
present situation but also the increasing nostalgia in the 
Russian army and the population for Russia's former superpower 
role. 
  As for the Hungarians living beyond the border and Hungarian 
foreign policy in general, the committee chairman said that more 
Hungarian initiatives and gestures will be necessary in the 
future and better care will have to be taken also that 
statements, which could be misunderstood, should not be uttered 
by members of the government in connection with the Hungarian 
minority beyond the border. Finally, Laszlo Kovacs also 
considered it harmful that, according to the decision of the 
present legislature, the Hungarian minorities will not have 
direct parliamentary representation.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The deputy director of the Gallup 
Institute in Hungary, Gyorgy Fischer, said in an interview in 
the 14 December Budapest weekly 168 ORA that according to 
Gallup's public opinion research data the liberal Federation of 
Young Democrats (Fidesz) will win the May parliamentary 
election. Moreover, if the election were held now, Fischer 
said, the four liberal parties in the field taken together would 
"have a decisive lead." Asked why Gallup's forecasts "depart" 
from those of other well-known polling organizations in Hungary, 
like Szonda Ipsos--which reported recently that the former 
reform communists' Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) has "caught 
up" with Fidesz and that "the public sees greater chances for an 
MSZP victory than a Fidesz victory" (NEPSZABDSAG, 13 
December)--Fischer said that the "seeming differences" result 
from the fact that other polling organizations "interpret their 
data differently." If the elections were held now, according to 
the Gallup data accompanying the interview, of those who have 
chosen a party, 29 percent would vote for Fidesz and 22 percent 
for the MSZP. The other parties would get the following 
percentages: the currently ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum, 
10; the Christian Democratic People's Party, 9; the liberal 
Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), 9; the Independent 
Smallholders Party, 6; and other parties, a total of 15. 
  Fischer did not dispute the finding of Szonda Ipsos and 
other 
polling agencies that the MSZP has become considerably more 
popular since last year and that Fidesz has lost popularity. He 
maintained, however, that the MSZP has reached its limit while 
the liberal parties have reserves of potential support. "The 
MSZP's ascendance has stopped" in the past four months, he 
argued, "and in fact, we can see a 2-3 percent decrease" in its 
vote-getting ability. Thus, although Gallup data show the MSZP 
running neck and neck with Fidesz, each with 24 percent of those 
who consider themselves "certain voters," Fischer declared that 
the data do not support predictions "of a landslide victory of 
the left" in the next election. "The MSZP has no place to grow," 
Fischer asserted, "because it has already won over everyone who 
was a potential supporter. It seems to have come up against a 
brick wall that it is not likely to break through." In contrast, 
Fischer said, "many" people cite Fidesz and its main liberal 
partner, SZDSZ, as their second choice. "It is important that 
few people consider the liberal parties to be ones that they 
would not vote for under any circumstances." 
  A table included with the interview compares the accuracy of 
the 1990 election predictions made by three prominent polling 
organizations: Gallup, Median, and the Hungarian Public Opinion 
Research Institute. (A footnote indicates that the government 
disbanded the latter in 1990 and that "most of its leading 
workers now work in the leadership of Szonda Ipsos.") According 
to the table, Gallup came closest to calling the election, 
coming within 1.7 percent of the overall result and not erring 
by more than 2.0 percent in its prediction for any individual 
party. The overall error rate of the Hungarian Public Opinion 
Research Institute was 2.2 percent and of Median 2.8 percent.

  [Text] Ljubljana, Jan 2 (TANJUG) -- Slovene Prime Minister 
Janez Drnovsek on Sunday warned the leadership of the 
neighbouring Republic of Croatia that `Slovenia may take a 
firmer stand towards Croatia as regards the resolution of mutual 
problems.' Drnovsek told Ljubljana Television that so far it 
has been Slovenia alone that has initiated talks, `sticking by 
what is termed a soft stand.' That was why Slovenia decided to 
`cool off relations for Croatia to realize that this problem 
must be of joint concern,' said Drnovsek. 
  In recent months, Slovene-Croatian relations have been 
broken 
off entirely, as was asserted also by Slovene Foreign Minister 
Lojze Peterle. One-time firm alliance between Ljubljana and 
Zagreb in breaking Yugoslavia has been affected by a series of 
outstanding territorial and other matters [sentence as received]. 
  The central problem is posed by a future sea border in the 
Piran Bay. Both sides adhere to their origiinal stands -- 
Slovenia insists on the current border, Croatia on a redrawn 
border. The settlement of the sea border issue, analysts 
believe, might engage also an international arbitration. In 
that case an additional weight would be put on what are at this 
time only minor territorial questions.

<F P=106> [Report by Maria Wagrowska: "The President Will Back the </F>
Army"] 
  [Text] Addressing members of the Polish Navy, Coast Guard, 
Air Force, and the Air Defense, President Lech Walesa, commander 
in chief of the Polish Army, said: "I have had many problems 
over the last three years, but there were none with the 
military." The president spoke at a New Year's meeting held on 
board the largest Polish destroyer, Warszawa. 
  Lech Walesa also assessed the elapsed period of his 
presidency, saying that "everything is okay in the concept that 
I once chose, however there were problems with the realization 
of the latter." The president added: "I bet on democracy and 
reform initiated by the people. Poland did not let others win 
the race. We will never have a better legislature than the one 
we have now; I mean that everything was discussed over the last 
four years and it only has to be given legal footing now." 
  Walesa stated that he had made no decision thus far 
regarding 
his running for another term as president but added that he 
would like to give it a try. 
  The president swore that he will do his best to assist the 
Army, saying in Piotr Kolodziejczyk's presence: "I will try and 
assist [the Army] through the person who is an expert in this 
matter. I will not put up with political divisions in the 
Army." The president advocates adopting the Army's budget once 
every four years, so that the Army can plan in advance. 
  Lech Walesa informed the audience that he will personally 
attend the 12 January conference of Visegrad Group leaders with 
President Bill Clinton, saying: "I hope he listens to us." 
  Answering a RZECZPOSPOLITA question regarding hopes placed 
on 
the 10-11 January NATO summit in Brussels, the president said 
that we should approach the West set by step, staying in the 
West's orbit. The West is skillfully scheming. It is happy 
that the Warsaw Pact and the communist bloc have ceased to 
exist, while we want a unified Europe.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 2 -- President Lech Walesa said on 
Sunday [2 January] in an interview for the Italian daily LA 
STAMPA that there was a threat of new east-west confrontation 
like the cold war unless the European Union embraced the East 
European countries that had been in the Eastern European bloc. 
If the European Union and NATO do not admit the Eastern 
European countries, Russia would seek to re-assert its influence 
in the region, said the president. If Europe and NATO decided 
within a short period of time, six months at the most, to expand 
gradually towards the European countries that were communist, 
then the field of confrontation would diminish, Walesa stressed. 
He added that otherwise Russia will take the initiative, 
exercising economic pressures on Poland and countries more 
important than Poland like Ukraine. We will have to give in to 
compromises and the former Soviet bloc will organise itself 
again, concluded Walesa.

the economy, declared Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak during this 
morning's conversation with listeners and journalists of Polish 
Radio's First Program. [passage omitted] 
  One of the important subjects broached during the

Poland joining the economic and defense structures of the West. 
  [Begin Pawlak recording] This is not just a case of our 
expectations and our choice -- it is also a case of the decision 
and the responsibility of European and other countries that make 
up the NATO structure. I think it is in our common interest 
that the changes that took place in 1989 should find a very 
definite expression in these joint interrelations -- both 
economic ones and those connected with external security -- in 
order that we might calmly be able to say that this was not just 
a short breath of freedom before having to cope with the same 
problems that we have had to deal with for such a long time.

  [Text] The most important tasks facing the government 
concern the economy, said Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak during 
this morning's early conversation with listeners and journalists 
in the "Signals of the Day" program. The most dangerous and the 
most difficult to deal with are foreign and internal debts and 
the payments hold-ups between enterprises. The prime minister 
believes that Poland, with the potential of its people and its 
economic potential, is capable of holding a worthy place in 
Europe. 
  Listeners asked the prime minister about his views on 
privatization: 
  [Begin Pawlak recording] As far as the principle goes I 
think 
one can say one thing: we must sell less and sell it better -- 
and then we shall all be satisfied -- because when comparing the 
effects of privatization for this year, when revenue from 
privatization amounts to about $400 million, when comparing this 
to some specific undertakings I don't know whether with this 
kind of money one could build as much as a Kwidzyn [city in 
Gdansk province]. So this illustrates the scale of this 
phenomenon. 
  So I would like to stress again: The point is to sell less 
-- 
for a better price. And then there will be no doubts regarding 
this process. 
  It is important that privatization should not be a program 
motivated only by ideology; it should be an undertaking which 
would improve the efficiency of the economy and an undertaking 
which would allow us to stabilize the economic situation. Here 
we have the example of other countries which managed to 
implement large privatization projects and to stabilize their 
economy. If this revenue is not used as soon as it is received 
then there will be both acceptance and justification for 
effecting such important undertakings. This task faces us all 
-- faces the government but also those who have a good grasp of 
the money market: to introduce procedures which will be 
effective. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with SdRP Chairman Aleksander Kwasniewski by Ewa </F>
Kaszuba; place and date not given: "Political Ornaments" -- 
questions published in boldface] 
  [Text] [Kaszuba] Will the new political debate which has 
been initiated within the Social Democracy of the Polish 
Republic [SdRP], the aim of which is to define the party's new 
goals -- will it make the left wing continue the political 
reforms initiated by "Solidarity?" 
  [Kwasniewski] After four years, we have found ourselves in a 
completely new political situation, so posing some fundamental 
questions is very appropriate now. The main elements of change 
in Poland are permanent, and we cannot make just a step back 
from them, but even a step sideways. I mean democracy, free 
market, ownership transformations which increase economic 
efficiency and the economy's openness to the world, I also mean 
the country's sovereignty and its inclusion in a European 
security system. Still, the question remains of how we intend 
to go about strengthening those main elements while at the same 
time implementing our program. I regard a third element as a 
personal task of mine -- the Polish political scene must 
stabilize itself, and once it has acquired a definite shape, 
there must be room in it for a strong social-democratic party. 
Such a party will be in power at times, and in the opposition 
at other times, but it will never be condemned to have any 
to-be-or-not-to-be doubts. 
  [Kaszuba] But if the left-wing government survives for four 
years, then it will finish what "Solidarity" has started. 
  [Kwasniewski] No, it will not finish but rather continue 
what "Solidarity" started. We are against constant revolutions 
taking place -- it would be a very bad thing if Poland was to 
adopt the kind of development model which is similar to the 
movement of a pendulum: From one wall to the other, and back 
again. Development is about strengthening achievements that 
have already been made and about introducing changes which would 
be in accordance with people's expectations. One can then live 
in a country which is better organized, with a higher standard 
of living and equal opportunities. In that sense, it is a 
continuation, and I am not afraid of using that word. The 
essence of the transformations -- which by the way were 
initiated earlier, since even though these were slogans 
proclaimed by "Solidarity" many of them were also declared 
during the "Roundtable" talks -- is to transform Poland into a 
democratic, well-organized, economically efficient, significant 
in global terms, and normal kind of country. 
  [Kaszuba] And also a capitalist one, with a constitution of 
a 
bourgeois democratic state. 
  [Kwasniewski] That ideology's significance around the world 
has been getting smaller and smaller. 
  [Kaszuba] Fine, but is it not your perception that we have 
an historical paradox here? Or maybe on the contrary -- maybe 
it is a natural course of events? 
  [Kwasniewski] I would lean toward the latter. Social 
democrats the world over have managed to make their contribution 
to free-market and democratic systems. But there is a debate 
going on about whether it is capitalism, socialism, or social 
democracy, and about what all these are supposed to be about. 
If we want to get something useful done in Poland, then we must 
immediately abandon such obsolete labels. If capitalism is a 
system of free markets with different ownership forms and based 
on democracy, then we are after capitalism. But should 
capitalism be described as exploitation of man and supremacy of 
the class of owners, then we should not be building capitalism. 
But for me it is a completely useless debate. The point is 
about having a vision of the country -- we may call it what we 
want, even though I tend to prefer calling it a 
social-democratic system -- in which there would be a free 
market, different ownership forms, an effective economy, a 
democracy, and with people having equal opportunities and power 
to influence official decisions. 
  [Kaszuba] For some time now, the fate of the Democratic Left 
Alliance [SLD] as an election alliance has been trembling in the 
balance. For many different reasons, the groups forming the 
alliance have been embarking on their own roads, while SdRP 
wants to take upon itself the task of leading SLD. Is SdRP 
already strong enough for that? 
  [Kwasniewski] SdRP is in a situation of absolute necessity 
-- it is the main pillar of SLD, and it is the only force to 
have nationwide political structures which are capable of 
implementing political tasks which are about getting ready for 
elections, explaining the government's measures, and looking for 
social support for these measures. In my view, the solution to 
the issue is in the hands of trade unionists, not SdRP. It is 
the trade unionists who found themselves in the most difficult 
situation. It is natural for them to be in the opposition -- 
they are critical of the government and they make demands 
while at the same time avoiding any responsibility. Right now 
they are part of the governing coalition and so they must change 
their line of reasoning -- from contesting and making claims, to 
a more pragmatic and efficient solving of problems facing 
employees. But the weak side of that concept is that the trade 
unions' role is not very spectacular, and that it will be hard 
to try to argue with the shouters and it will be even harder to 
win battles with them. The All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement 
[OPZZ] is not the first trade union to have found itself in this 
kind of situation. We are familiar with what "Solidarity" went 
through -- the union has never decided to back the government 
completely, it led to the government's collapse and today it is 
absent from the parliament. That is an important factor in 
debates. OPZZ is not the first trade union to participate in 
political structures, either -- it was the same case in Sweden, 
Spain, and Greece for years. 
  [Kaszuba] What other source of SdRP's radicalization in 
personnel issues could there be aside from its feeling of 
strength? 
  [Kwasniewski] It is not a radicalization at all. Does 
election victory in a democratic country mean that a government 
is formed and the winning party makes no appointments apart from 
ministerial posts, with the president's policies being 
implemented in presidential ministries, and the predecessors' 
policies being implemented in the other ministries so as to gain 
support from the mass media? Does that also mean that there are 
no changes at the level of voivodships [administrative 
districts], even though some voivodes [local government 
officials] do not have any great willingness to cooperate with 
representatives of the new government? That would not mean being 
in power but enjoying being in power at the supreme levels. We 
think that every government should have necessary instruments 
and procedures at its disposal. This is also the essence of the 
dispute about participation in presidential ministries' 
leaderships. They are included in the government's structure so 
the prime minister and the whole coalition bear responsibility 
for measures undertaken also by those ministries. So we would 
like to have some influence over them. The whole issue would 
never have even come to surface if it was not for some 
deficiencies in the process of agreeing on certain issues. We 
came to the conclusion that direct influence is insufficient. 
So for the sake of those ministries, and for the sake of 
integrating measures undertaken by the government with those 
undertaken by the president, a system must be created in which 
the flow of information and consultations would be complete. 
  [Kaszuba] But the sudden interest expressed in the 
ministries tends to create the impression of the coalition 
having come to a conclusion that it can afford to get involved 
in a conflict with the president at this stage. 
  [Kwasniewski] The president is someone who undertakes 
different measures and makes different value judgments at 
different points in time. Our proposals -- these were jointly 
agreed upon by SLD and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] -- are 
neither a result of a willingness to be begging for conflicts, 
nor of a contention that the president is now weak, so one can 
launch an attack on him. Rather, the proposals are the result of 
a conviction that the ministries' activities cannot be out of 
the government's control since that would mean that first, we 
would create an unconstitutional situation. Secondly, a joint 
creation of concepts by the ministers, the president, and the 
governing coalition, will better serve the cause of ruling the 
country. 
  [Kaszuba] And the coalition hopes that the president will 
continue to swallow the bitter pills without uttering a word? 
  [Kwasniewski] What bitter pills? I am sure the president 
will understand that it is in his best interests. After all, 
you just cannot think this way: This is my backyard and 
everybody else can keep their noses out of it. There are no 
constitutional provisions to justify such a view. If foreign, 
internal, and defense policy is to be implemented exclusively by 
the president, then government members should not implement it 
but rather high-ranking officials in the President's Office. 
The Constitution provides -- and we adhere to this -- that the 
president is the commander in chief of the Armed Forces, that he 
participates in shaping both foreign and domestic policy, and 
that he has influence over filling those posts. The ministers 
were appointed in accordance with his wishes, and now the 
coalition would like to have the possibility of participating in 
decisionmaking within the ministries. Foreign policy, internal 
policy, and defense issues -- these are the main parts of any 
government's business and that is the case around the world. 
  [Kaszuba] Two months ago, SLD used to say it does not plan 
on replacing voivodes. Right now the party -- along with PSL -- 
announces widespread purges. 
  [Kwasniewski] The fact that up to now there have been very 
few changes proves that there is no purge going on whatsoever. 
I think we will always be between two extremes: On the one 
hand there will be views expressed that the coalition fails to 
influence an important part of the government's policy, but on 
the other hand, following any kind of personnel measure there 
will be talk of purges and retaliation. Both views are false. 
  [Kaszuba] But one does not change one's views on an issue as 
important as this within a period of two months. Is it not the 
case that by leaving voivodes alone the coalition was courting 
the Democratic Union [UD], but once it found out there is no 
chance for agreement -- at least for now -- then it decided to 
come back to the issue? 
  [Kwasniewski] Our relationship with UD was predetermined by 
recent statements made by its leaders. UD wants to remain a 
definite opposition party and an alternative to the arrangement 
now in power. Aleksander Smolar even wrote that it was a 
mistake to vote for Oleksy, that it was a mistake to abstain 
during votes in the Sejm Constitutional Commission, and that one 
should have shown society with determination that UD was in 
opposition. In that sense, the roles have been divided and I 
can see no political possibilities -- even though one could find 
some substantive ones -- to come into alliance. I cannot 
imagine, either that following PSL's statements during the 
debate on a vote of confidence for Suchocka's government, we 
could see UD courting PSL again. 
  [Kaszuba] SLD abstained, so it can keep courting. 
  [Kwasniewski] We did not abstain from courting UD. There 
was too much politics in the debate and not enough of sticking 
to the letter of the law. Political decisions concerning the 
previous governments had been made -- both of them were brought 
down. To me, that was when political issues were done with. 
The question put before the Sejm was: Was the budget adopted 
by the previous Sejm ever implemented? If someone thinks it was 
not implemented, then he should continue the trail and look for 
the guilty party. 
  [Kaszuba] There was talk in SLD circles under the previous 
Sejm that Ireneusz Sekula was a wasted seat in parliament. How 
did this sudden reversal come about, I mean his appointment as 
chief of the Main Customs Office? 
  [Kwasniewski] Sekula is a good organizer and manager, he is 
experienced in working in large, state-owned institutions, and 
he is also psychologically predisposed to carry through 
difficult operations. He is just strong psychologically. Apart 
from that, he also enjoys social support, he has been 
politically active since 1990, he was elected Sejm deputy twice, 
and had he not been elected, he would not have made the comeback 
now. 
  [Kaszuba] But he has always aroused controversy, even among 
his colleagues from his deputy club. 
  [Kwasniewski] Yes, and that is why he occupied position 
number 16 on the electoral list but he still managed to win in 
his electoral district, and that must be respected. Those 
colleagues who had raised their objections and then lost to 
Sekula, should bow before him. 
  [Kaszuba] Is the essence of the governing parties' 
far-sightedness about that they will take up the most important 
posts and the government's immediate base, followed by having 
provisions on public civil service enacted which would be 
apolitical and not subject to changes along with changes of 
political teams? And this way, the supposedly apolitical posts 
will be permanently occupied by people representing the left 
wing? 
  [Kwasniewski] We need a law on civil employees of public 
services but if it is enacted, then it will be possible to 
withdraw political nominations. The point must be defined at 
which public and irremovable service begins which would be based 
on contracts, and then people must be found to fill those posts, 
people whose political views will be irrelevant. 
  [Kaszuba] Can you say with absolute certainty that this will 
be the order in which events will happen? 
  [Kwasniewski] That order simply must happen, if all this is 
to make any sense at all. In any case, nobody will believe that 
a politically appointed voivode can become a "civil servant" 
overnight. We will deal with that when the right time comes. 
Of course, once the law becomes effective, it will influence 
the way personnel are appointed. It would be the same case if 
UD was in power today. After all, the apolitical nature of 
voivodes presented a diversified picture under the previous 
cabinet. Not only were they not apolitical, but they were also 
active in specific political parties, including PSL. SLD was 
the only party which was totally absent from state 
administration agencies. 
  [Kaszuba] And you insist that is not retaliation? 
  [Kwasniewski] One could comment on any kind of change by 
saying it is retaliation. The word is being used much too 
often; one could speak of retaliation if changes were introduced 
everywhere after two months and if people from the old Polish 
United Workers Party took up voivode posts. That would be a 
case of retaliation, it would be a purely political act, and 
also complete stupidity. An opinion on people performing public 
posts cannot be political in its nature and nothing else. If we 
have a case of a good voivode -- and I know a few of those 
although I want to cite no names since I am not sure whether 
that could harm them or be good for them -- who happens to be 
from the right wing, he should remain at his post. But if there 
is someone who is incompetent, then he must leave. The 
coalition is not only responsible for who is in power, but also 
for the entirety of issues in Poland. What about personnel 
replacements? Of course they happen -- that is the case all 
over the world when it comes to such posts. 
  [Kaszuba] It has been a month and a half since your apology 
in the Sejm [for abuses under previous communist regimes]. Do 
you feel you have been forgiven? 
  [Kwasniewski] I did not expect anybody to forgive me. 
  [Kaszuba] So why did you make the apology? 
  [Kwasniewski] To me, the "I'm sorry" was an important 
political act. In the context of the whole speech it meant that 
the past is a closed chapter and there is no going back. I am 
aware that 20 percent of the people voted for us, but on the 
other hand, many people fear going back to the old ways. And I 
think that those people who can afford to speak frankly and do 
not have to decorate their statements with different political 
ornaments -- I think those people approved of my statement. 
They became convinced that there is no going back to an era 
which we are all fed up with.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy by Krzysztof </F>
Skowronski at the Radio Zet studio in Warsaw; from the "Guest of 
Radio Zet" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Skowronski] Radio Zet's guest today is Sejm 
Speaker Jozef Oleksy. Good morning to you. 
  [Oleksy] Good morning. 
  [Skowronski] I think there has never been a New Year's Eve 
with this kind of rainy and hopeless weather. 
  [Oleksy] Yes, it is a dull day, very bad weather, and it is 
warm and wet. It is not going to be a successful New Year's Eve. 
  [Skowronski] And how are you feeling, Mr. Speaker? 
  [Oleksy] Well, I am overworked, I am looking forward very 
much to this weekend, the relaxation and the tranquility. And 
this is exactly what how I will spend the three days. 
  [Skowronski] Will you have a New Year's Eve celebration, or 
not? 
  [Oleksy] I am not planning on any. I have conducted 
negotiations with my wife and we are not going to any ball -- we 
will just stay home with the children, quietly. There could be 
the problem of a possible traditional invasion by my colleagues 
and friends, but I think I will be successful in avoiding it. 
  [Skowronski] But there is a bottle of champagne already 
cooling in the fridge. 
  [Oleksy] Yes, there are a few of those to be used later. 
  [Skowronski] You said a few bottles, so that means two, or 
perhaps more than that? 
  [Oleksy] Well, there are three bottles. 
  [Skowronski] What can one see from the top of the power 
structure? What is happening in Poland? 
  [Oleksy] We can see that the end of the year is surrounded 
by a situation of decreased emotions, as it were -- that is my 
impression. By the way, the year was full of significant events 
and issues, and if that perception of mine is correct, I think 
one can look forward to 1994 as a relatively peaceful kind of 
year. I think that the thing that could disturb the peace is 
some kind of social tension, or problems in major factories, but 
let us hope it will not happen because then -- with quite a 
rigorous budget, as can be seen from the budget draft -- if the 
budget was to be implemented within that rigorous framework and 
if it would not be coupled with any major social disasters in 
workplaces and in different social spheres, then one could say 
that this relatively peaceful 1994 could be a sound basis for 
1995, which would then be a year of a clear improvement of the 
country's situation. 
  [Skowronski] You use phrases in your statements from time to 
time, describing the danger of social disasters or protests. Is 
there a major danger of this kind? Is Poland's situation.... 
[pauses] At what point are we now? 
  [Oleksy] I think that this type of tension will continue to 
accompany the process of transformations for a long time still, 
since there are differences in situations of different economic 
establishments, in their financial conditions and consequently 
also in the situation of people who are employed there, so it is 
inconceivable that there should not be any tensions at all. The 
main point is about the scale of those tensions and about the 
possible tendency to use such tensions for political purposes. 
I hope -- and I trust very much -- that the peace at the end of 
this year means that next year there will not be any tendency to 
use what are oftentimes natural tensions and the population's 
dissatisfaction for political goals. May we see as little as 
possible of that, as I said. May we see that there is a 
relatively popular understanding of the situation, and also may 
politicians and parties -- contrary to what happened not so long 
ago -- abstain from using these tensions which may occur, for 
purposes of their political games. 
  [Skowronski] When will the battle for the Belvedere begin in 
Poland? 
  [Oleksy] I think it is already beginning, gradually -- it is 
not very clear to the public at times, but sometimes one can 
clearly see its signs. But I think it is too soon for that yet. 
I think work on a new constitution will unavoidably mark the 
beginning of at least a more clearly visible debate on future 
power structures, on divisions among different authorities, on 
who is to have how much power, and also on the mutual 
relationships among the individual components of state power at 
the highest level, and also on what kind of decentralization of 
political power should occur in the direction of 
self-governments. There are self-government elections coming up 
in May which will not be legally prepared to a sufficient degree 
as it were, I mean from the standpoint of executive laws and 
comprehensive changes in the system of financing gminas [small 
administrative units]. In a word, I think that the beginning of 
work on the new constitution will mark the actual beginning of a 
debate -- and also perhaps of emotions or of attempts to have 
one's own way or of showing the direction one wants things to 
head. I think that beginning sometime in mid-1994 -- or 
practically speaking, from the moment the legislative initiative 
submitted by the Union of Labor is voted upon -- then we will be 
able to speak of the beginning of a constitutional debate, 
including the part of the constitution related to presidential 
elections. 
  [Skowronski] Due to your official duties, you have been 
meeting very often with the president, that is Lech Walesa. What 
is the rapport between you two? Could you give us more of a 
personal type of answer? 
  [Oleksy] It is an overstatement to say I have been meeting 
with him very often. 
  [Skowronski] But it is certainly more frequent than before 
19 September? 
  [Oleksy] Definitely. Well, President Lech Walesa is an 
extremely good conversationalist and a man who is capable of 
even being extremely engaging and straightforward during direct, 
personal contact with him, and one could also say he is human 
and normal in such moments. This is different to what he 
projects publicly when one's personality always comes through in 
a different way, even somewhat artificially, too. But I miss 
one thing in these contacts with the president: a more thorough 
discussion of Polish issues, I mean the kind of discussion where 
the country's president and Sejm speaker -- perhaps also with 
some other participants, but not too many -- would be involved 
in a deeper kind of wider debate. After all, it would not be 
binding when it comes to decisionmaking, but it would reduce 
differences in information levels and it could also contribute 
to a convergence of views on some very immediate issues, but 
ones which are significant in the long run. That is what I 
would like to see. Our conversations very clearly pertain to 
the immediate situation at hand, issues or even differences of 
opinions, but there has not been any opportunity for 
conversations about the country during which -- as I said -- the 
highest ranking politicians would -- I can see it as in a 
picture -- be looking for common ways and common views, while 
very concerned for their country's fate. 
  [Skowronski] So the president has not revealed to you the 
fundamental plan for Poland which he had prepared three years 
ago? 
  [Oleksy] I am trying very hard to convince the president to 
go back to that fundamental plan, but this time it cannot be in 
the form of a slogan. I am convinced that a slogan....[pauses] 
A fundamental plan is very important for Poland today because 
it is time now -- after the change resulting from the elections, 
after four years of accomplishments, after a certain clarity .... 
  [Skowronski, interrupting] You mean after four years of 
success? 
  [Oleksy] No, success is a very dangerous term here, but 
there were certainly some accomplishments and a democracy during 
those four years, also a market economy was built and there was 
all kind of turmoil -- which by the way is also a valuable 
lesson -- so after the four years, after the post-election turn, 
and after -- I think -- emotions and fears in connection with 
the center-leftist government have subsided, it is now time for 
a strategic kind of approach, a common approach, not just by one 
or two governing parties, but by many ingredients which have the 
power to shape public opinion or even to shape power in the 
country; it is time for a common approach to a strategy which 
would extend even beyond the next two or three years. That is 
the equality plan -- this is the way I see it -- but it must 
have substance to it and that is why I have been trying very 
hard to convince President Walesa -- within his coming back to 
the fundamental plan since he is already doing that -- to make 
his staff return to the plan -- perhaps also in debates with 
others -- in a way that would make it specific and adapted to 
debates on practical solutions. 
  [Skowronski] If you were to outline such a fundamental plan 
right now, what would be the first item there? 
  [Oleksy] Undoubtedly the first item would be the issue of 
debts incurred by the state, both domestic and foreign, and 
everything that must be done to eliminate or at least decrease 
this phenomenon, which is extremely dangerous for the economy. 
A second issue would be a constitution which would put in order 
some principles of a democratic and legally based country since 
there has been a lot of confusion created around those issues. 
A third issue would beyond any doubt be a strategy of a more 
thorough look at long-term security of the country, including a 
thorough analysis of the radical events in Russia and their 
impact on possible changes in Western views. I think that 
Poland faces the danger of ending up in a kind of vacuum -- may 
it not come to that, the activity in that area is quite clear. 
I know and I have been saying that Poland is not secure, either 
externally or domestically. The president has been saying the 
same thing by the way, except -- as I said -- it requires more 
specific proposals, and I think that apart from these three 
issues, there is certainly also the unquestionably strategic 
issue of self-governments and of adapting the state and its 
structures to a new approach to our Third Republic, and so these 
four issues are included in the fundamental plan. I ignored 
here of course such issues as the civilization standard of 
society's education.... 
  Yes, we could go on listing such issues here. 
  Will the left wing win the self-government elections? Are 
you convinced of that? 
  [Oleksy] We are all wondering what will happen and I think 
it is not just us, the left wing. If the left wing were to win 
the elections, that would be a very important confirmation of 
the way the majority of society thinks politically, not only at 
the top but also in local communities. There could occur 
different outcomes and I think we will not manage to prevent a 
process of making these self-government elections political, but 
that would not be a good thing since in a well-ordered country, 
self-government elections should be far removed from political 
games. 
  [Skowronski] Do you think that the voters are disappointed 
after the few months of left-wing rule? 
  [Oleksy] I think that there are no reasons whatsoever as of 
yet to be disappointed. We did what was technically possible to 
do for the poor and weak within a period of two and a half 
months. There were also similar announcements made with regard 
to 1994. It may be a disappointment with regard to the extent 
of the measures, but the fundamental thing is that a trend to 
have good intentions and the will to act was demonstrated, I 
mean with regard to budget-type measures and not just for 1994, 
with the main emphasis being put on looking for possibilities to 
assist the weak of our society. The fact that the raises are 
modest and that the valorization levels are not too high -- that 
is an issue of financial possibilities and of the state of 
public finances that the coalition took over from the previous 
team.... 
  [Skowronski, interrupting] You mean an empty state Treasury? 
  [Oleksy] And that requires time. I think a majority of 
people understand that. I think what people need the most today 
is the faith that they are being treated with honesty, that the 
government thinks about them, and that their problems are 
regarded as number one, while I think the majority understands 
that the rates of increases and the scale of financial 
assistance will increase with the passage of time. 
  [Skowronski] Do you like the budget draft presented by Prime 
Minister Pawlak? 
  [Oleksy] To be honest, I will only begin studying it in a 
thorough manner on New Year's Day. I am familiar with all the 
main principles of the draft and also with the arguments that 
were voiced. I think that among the draft's negative sides 
could be its underestimation -- even though others say it is an 
overestimation.... 
  [Skowronski, interrupting] Underestimation of what? 
  [Oleksy] Of budget revenues. I personally think that taking 
into account huge disputes which we may see on that occasion, 
the budget I think will be adopted with minor modifications 
only, but then the government will have to work very hard to 
increase the revenues. Expenditure cuts are already out of the 
question in most of the areas. 
  [Skowronski] Sejm Deputy and Minister Miller has been 
announcing a major battle surrounding the budget. Are you 
afraid of Deputy Miller? Is he capable of making the budget 
fall apart? 
  [Oleksy] Deputy Miller is a very consistent type of 
personality and he should be praised for that. I like it when 
people display such traits. I think he has been performing his 
job in a responsible manner and I think that constitutes a 
certain discomfort to the prime minister, to the coalition and 
to the Democratic Left Alliance.... 
  [Skowronski, interrupting] But he still demands 6 trillion 
zlotys? 
  [Oleksy] Exactly, and he also provided justifications for 
his demands and he demonstrated from which sources he intends to 
get the money. I do not think it is a good thing to have such 
public disputes between individual ministers and the Council of 
Ministers as a whole, which is the body that adopts the budget 
as a whole. But if you look at it from the standpoint of a 
certain course of action required for the sake of meeting social 
needs, I say he has been doing that with dignity. 
  [Skowronski] You said you do not discuss the fundamental 
plan with the president. Now what about Waldemar Pawlak? 
  [Oleksy] I have had many more discussions with him than with 
the president, there is a very direct contact between us and 
that is a natural thing to happen between a prime minister and 
the Sejm leadership.... 
  [Skowronski, interrupting] So the prime minister's female 
assistant does not have to be an intermediary? 
  [Oleksy] But I have not debated the fundamental plan with 
the prime minister yet. 
  [Skowronski] What about relations with Aleksander 
Kwasniewski? 
  [Oleksy] I have been debating all kinds of plans with him -- 
both fundamental plans and also the less important ones, and 
even additional or complementary ones, but we have not finished 
the overall debate yet. 
  [Skowronski] Why did Aleksander Kwasniewski not make a 
speech during the recent Sejm debate following the prime 
minister's address? 
  [Oleksy] Because that was the first instance of the prime 
minister deciding to make a speech in a kind of ad hoc manner, 
and under that situation it was quite logical that the time for 
debate and discussion should be given primarily to the 
opposition. After all, what could a speech made by a member of 
a coalition party contain? Of course it would be praising what 
the prime minister said. I even thought it would be quite 
logical not to have any governing party speak out then, after 
the prime minister's speech. Yes, a Polish Peasant Party 
representative did speak out, and Kwasniewski did not. It is 
not the end of the world. 
  [Skowronski] What was the happiest day in 1993 for you, Mr. 
Speaker? 
  [Oleksy] Definitely 19 September. 
  [Skowronski] Why is that? 
  [Oleksy] Because a lot of psychological burden was taken off 
my chest at that point, which I had had inside of me before 
then, as it turned out, and I was not even conscious of that 
burden. The election results took that burden off me and 
allowed me to breathe with relief again when I realized that if 
you act according to rules of honesty and persistence in a 
democracy, it must bring positive results sooner or later. 
  [Skowronski] Is a man who is speaker of the Sejm a happy 
man? 
  [Oleksy] It is a hard and dangerous thing to speak of 
happiness with regard to politics. My job is first of all about 
work and service -- that is the way I see it and I am not 
looking for happiness in the job of Sejm speaker but in hard 
work, and if work is a source of happiness -- which it is in 
some cases -- then my answer is yes. 
  [Skowronski] Thank you very much for the conversation. 
  [Oleksy] Thank you. 
  [Skowronski] Radio Zet's guest today has been Sejm Speaker 
Jozef Oleksy.

  [Text] Warsaw, 30 December -- An indictment against 
Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski in the case relating to the illegal 
turnover of hard currency in 1990 between the former CPSU and 
the former PZPR [Polish United Workers Party] has been directed 
to the Regional Court for Warsaw by the capital Prosecutor's 
Office, its head, Prosecutor Jerzy Labuda, has reported. 
  The Prosecutor's Office accuses Rakowski of having in 
January 
1990 received from the then CPSU Central Committee a loan of 
$1.2 million and 500 million zloties without the required hard 
currency permit, which broke the Treasury Penal Law. This was 
to have been financial aid for the PZPR prior to its final 
congress. 
  On 8 December, the Prosecutor's Office discontinued 
proceedings against Leszek Miller in the face of a lack of 
evidence of his having committed a crime. He had been accused 
of having repaid $600,000 of this loan in November 1990, 
transgressing the law. In accordance with the regulations in 
force in 1990, the actions of which Rakowski is accused carried 
the penalty of a fine of up to 2 million zloties. 
  The capital Prosecutor's Office commenced an investigation 
in 
November 1991 on the basis of materials gathered by the State 
Protection Office. It had been waiting for many months for a 
reply from the Russian prosecutor's office, which it had 
addressed with a request for legal assistance and the 
questioning of USSR former Vice President Yanayev and a number 
of employees of the former CPSU Central Committee. 
  In the middle of October this year, Prosecutor Janusz 
Regulski, who was then leading the investigation, decided to 
discontinue it, inter alia in the face of the low credibility of 
the testimony of the two Russians involved in the financing by 
the former CPSU of other communist parties. 
  The implementation of this decision was suspended though; in 
the view of the heads of the capital prosecutor's office, 
Regulski inter alia deemed the action of which Rakowski is 
accused an action "of low degree of social threat," whereas the 
amount of money at hand was the not at all modest sum of over a 
million U.S. dollars.

  [Excerpts] Warsaw, 30 Dec -- On 30 December 1993 Internal 
Affairs Minister Andrzej Milczanowski repealed the clause 
"confidential" from the Ministry of Internal Affairs' [MSW] 1983 
instruction on principles and ways of handling classified 
information and professional confidentiality. 
  The instruction is one of the executory regulations 
accompanying the 1982 Law on the Protection of State Secrets. 
MSW press spokesman Andrzej Szczypinski announced that the text 
of this regulation would be made available to the press next 
week. [passage omitted] 
  Szczypinski did not deny that today's decision by the 
interior minister was connected with a discussion on the 
government's draft Law on the Protection of State Secrets and 
Professional Confidentiality presented in the Sejm on 2 December 
1993. Among other things, the draft bans every person, 
including journalists, who has information classified by the 
government as secret from revealing it. Jerzy Zimowski, deputy 
minister of internal affairs, said on 22 December that the 
ministry "will not favor solutions too harsh for journalists" 
and suggested that the role of the press in cases of classified 
information should be discussed.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent S. Matczak, including recorded </F>
remarks by Marek Borowski, deputy prime minister and finance 
minister] 
  [Text] The government has prepared a diary of this year's 
price rises. It has done this to ensure budget revenues and to 
avoid springing surprises on the public. According to [Deputy] 
Prime Minister [and Finance Minister] Marek Borowski, the 
planned rises are lower than assumed in the agreement with the 
World Bank. 
  [Matczak] According to the authors of the official inflation 
index, there are few countries which have a totally free market. 
For instance, in Germany six years ago the state controlled 
more prices than in Poland at present, but no one used to deny 
there was a free market in Germany. [video shows cash tills; 
street scenes] 
  We are going to get the first round of price increases in 
February. After electric power and gas, fuel prices will go up 
in March, while those of central heating, hot water and 
medicines will go up in April. [video shows following table]

September, will be introduced in July. Also power and gas 
prices will go up again. [video shows following table]

  [Borowski] You have to look at this issue in a different 
way. If we were to say: Let the prices be whatever the 
producers want them to be, then it is very likely that with our 
state of the market we would have greater price increases than 
the ones we prescribe, if I may put it thus. 
  [Matczak] According to the budget, next year prices will go 
up by 27 percent. The biggest rises will apply to housing 
rents, central heating and hot water, gas, power, and medicines. 
Excise tax will be increased, which will affect the prices of 
fuels, alcohol and cigarettes. But it is not known when the 
latter two commodities will go up. [video shows following table]

  [Borowski] Well, we do have a market economy, albeit one 
with a few prices which are influenced by the state. 
  [Matczak] The zloty [Z] will be devalued by 1.6 percent a 
month and by the end of the year we will be paying Z26,300 for 
one dollar. But at the end of 1993 the dollar cost Z1,000 more 
than planned.

<F P=106> [Report by Renata Wrobel: "Forty-Four Pilots"] </F>
  [Text] In the new year, the pilotage program has formally 
been started: the self-government authorities of the largest 
Polish cities took over new tasks. Forty-four of the 46 
selected cities decided to take part in the program. In line 
with the intention of its authors, the program is supposed to 
meet two goals: First, which is generally believed to be of 
paramount importance, is to make the managing of local affairs 
more efficient. The second goal is a test before introducing 
self-government powiats [small administrative units]. 
  The change lies in the following: the city -- that is, the 
council elected in general elections and the mayor appointed by 
it -- will deal with some of the affairs that have so far been 
in the domain of the government administration (of ministries, 
voivodes, regional offices). It will receive a special subsidy 
from the state budget. The subsidy, as Finance Deputy Minister 
Wojciech Misiag said in the Sejm, will not be bigger 
(self-governments hope that it will not be smaller either) than 
the subsidy that would be given to the administration. This 
operation is supposed to yield three kinds of benefits: 
  -- make management more uniform, by concentrating the 
powers, 
which have so far been scattered, in the hands of 
self-government authorities; 
  -- submit the activities of yet other establishments under 
social control. This control is exercised by the council, which 
every four years is evaluated by the city's inhabitants in 
elections. Control over centrally steered civil servants is far 
less efficient; 
  -- ensure better spending of public money. There are many 
examples which show that local authorities spend their money 
more thriftily and wisely; they can also pursue a much more 
flexible budget policy than centralized structures. 
<H5>  The Pilotage Program Has an Eventful History </H5>
  On 29 December 1992, Michal Kulesza, the government's 
representative for public administration reform, forwarded a 
letter to the mayors of selected cities; he asked them whether 
they would be interested in taking part in such an undertaking. 
At the very beginning it was established that cities would be 
free to make this decision independently. Forty-six cities were 
selected; each of them has more than 100,000 inhabitants (except 
Warsaw, due to a complex system of self-government); there are 
also several smaller towns which are part of urban complexes. 
As many as 50 percent of Poland's inhabitants live in the 
selected cities; their budgets constitute 40 percent of all 
self-governments' finances. 
  In February 1993, the Sejm adopted the budget law. Article 
35 empowered the government to issue an order concerning the 
pilotage program. In July, Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka met 
with the mayors and chairmen of municipal councils of the cities 
participating in the program. She stated that "one cannot 
change Poland without changing its cities." "We are ready to 
make the effort. We have been waiting for this for three years. 
We really want the program to be successful," answered Wojciech 
Szczesny Kaczmarek, president of the Union of Polish Towns and 
Cities and mayor of Poznan. Soon afterward, on 13 July... 
<H5>  The Council of Ministers Adopted a "Pilotage" Order </H5>
  In line with it, cities were supposed to take over the 
following: 
  -- administrative powers, such as those concerning ground 
policy, construction, road traffic (such as registration of 
vehicles, issuing or withholding drivers' licenses); 
  -- such establishments as secondary schools, culture 
establishments, health service institutions, houses of social 
care, as well as managing national and voivodship roads, except 
highways and expressways; 
  -- administrative police forces, such as protection from 
fire. 
  Among other things, approximately 30 cultural establishments 
of "all-national importance," as well as specialized health 
service institutions of voivodship or national importance were 
supposed to remain under state administration. Along with new 
duties, cities were supposed to take over indispensable 
buildings for free and receive money from the state budget. 
This was supposed to be a purposeful subsidy [a subsidy for a 
particular purpose], but gminas [small administrative units] 
were supposed to be free to move the money from one area to 
another. Self-governments were supposed to be free from the 
debts incurred by various establishments before the middle of 
1993. The deadline for signing agreements by mayors and 
voivodes was set for 30 October. 
  Just a few days before this day, when 28 cities had already 
concluded their agreements, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak sent 
a fax ordering a stop to this operation. The decision was 
explained by the "intention of obtaining exact information 
concerning the course of the pilotage program to date and 
carrying out a legal and substantive analysis of it." Cities 
and national self-governmental organizations soon protested 
violently against the stopping of the program. Soon afterward 
the government made a decision: the agreements must not be 
signed until 30 November; after that, cities will be allowed to 
do it until 20 December. 
<H5>  The Scope of the Pilotage Was Restricted </H5>
  This also concerned the cities that had signed their 
agreements earlier; it encountered accusations of breaking the 
rule that the law is not retroactive. Chorzow and Grudziadz 
withdrew, being deterred by the "disloyalty of the partner." 
They have not given up new powers; they will take them over 
from voivodes on the basis of individual agreements. 
  The number of the culture establishments that will not be 
transferred to self-governments has risen five times -- to 150 
and comprised such institutions as voivodship public libraries 
and houses of culture. It was the result of protests by culture 
employees and artists, including the Union of Polish Stage 
Artists and "Solidarity." Although even Deputy Minister Michal 
Jagiello recalled that self-governments pay for culture (even 
though they would not have to) more money than the state budget 
via voivodes and that establishments taken care of by the 
ministry are not doing better than those financed by 
self-governments, Minister Kazimierz Dejmek managed to force the 
decision on limiting the pilotage. 
  Not all cities will take over secondary schools, first of 
all 
for financial reasons. For a long time it was not clear what 
would happen to school debt. The government's decision that the 
state budget will be responsible for those debts which should 
have been paid off by 30 November, was made on 23 December at 
night. There are other problems as well. Only on 29 December, 
at the meeting of the team steering the pilotage program, did 
representatives of self- governments manage to obtain the most 
recent information on the sums to be allocated for the 
maintenance of various schools. It turned out that they differ 
from those presented earlier by school superintendents. In the 
atmosphere of uncertainty, some cities (such as Bialystok, 
Koszalin, Lublin, Poznan, Slupsk) decided to give up the idea of 
taking over secondary schools. 
  For the time being in the budget bill... 
<H5>  There Is No Trace of Pilotage </H5>
  It is still not clear what sums the state budget will 
earmark 
for cities. The Finance Ministry has committed itself to 
calculating everything as soon as it obtains full information on 
what the various cities will take over. Then an appendix will 
be drawn up which will be forwarded to the Sejm as a 
governmental amendment. 
  What needs to be explained is the matter of debts of the 
establishments taken over by cities. It is known that the 
budget will deal with the debts of secondary schools that should 
have been paid off by 30 November 1993, and the debts of other 
establishments -- by 30 June 1993. At the meeting of the team 
steering the pilotage it was decided that the finance minister 
would propose to the Council of Ministers that health service 
institutions and culture establishments be treated the same way 
as secondary schools. Self-government activists recall that the 
debts have been incurred by budget sphere establishments; they 
believe that the government can do one of two things: keep the 
establishments that are working inefficiently as well as their 
debts, or keep only their debts. 
  Self-government activists are not satisfied with the way 
money is supposed to be transferred. Originally it was assumed 
that all the money would pass through the voivodes' budgets. 
Now it is planned that the money will be given by voivodes and 
the various ministers; however, only voivodes will see to it 
that the money comes in time and is sufficient in amount. 
Cities believe that this does not guarantee them financial 
security. 
  Despite reservations, the self-governments of most towns 
have 
not withdrawn from the program (even though some of them add 
that after a few months they may consider such a possibility). 
They are prepared to add from several to a few hundred billion 
zlotys to new establishments. "We risk our posts, but we must 
take anything we can from the hands of irresponsible people," 
says Bytom's Janusz Paczocha, "enfant terrible" [preceding two 
words in French] among city mayors. Gdynia Mayor Franciszka 
Cegielska adds: "We may get into trouble as authorities, but 
this is what the inhabitants want us to do." Self-government 
activists are disappointed that the prime minister has not even 
once made a political declaration that he would like the 
pilotage program to be successful.

  [Text] Obrenovac, 31 Dec (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, 
president of the Assembly of the republic of Srpska, has said 
that this year the Serbs of the republic of Srpska have been 
carrying out the difficult task of fighting the entire world to 
save their state, their dignity, and their freedom. In this 
difficult struggle we have managed, along with all the other 
Serbs who have been vilified for demonstrating solidarity with 
us, to resist all the pressures which fundamentally aimed to 
bring about Serbian divisions and rifts, Krajisnik said. 
  Krajisnik maintains that there has been no justice or law in 
all these assaults on us, something that is best borne out by 
the European Union [EU] stands, as it in fact encouraged the 
Muslims to first gain a foothold in central Bosnia and then to 
take on the Serbs in the spring. We will, of course, be ready 
for them, Krajisnik cautioned. 
  Asked by a Obrenovac radio reporter whether a change in the 
leadership of Herceg-Bosna would tilt the balance of forces on 
the ground, Mr. Krajisnik said that the possibility of Mate 
Boban being replaced by Akmadzic would result in better 
relations between the Croats and Muslims, something that in its 
turn would not bring about changes to the Serbian negotiating 
position. "All the more so since neither of them takes any 
steps, as this is done by Mr. Tudjman, the Catholic Church and 
the Vatican. In any case, as far as the Muslims are concerned, 
there will be no further concessions, as it has already been 
proved that they cannot reach their goal. Concessions in 
western or eastern Bosnia would jeopardize the continuity of the 
republic of Srpska," Krajisnik said.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 31 Dec (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the republic of Srpska, sent a letter today to 
Willy Claes, chairman of the European Union's council, in reply 
to his claim that the responsibility for the continuation of the 
conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina lay with the Serb side. 
  The letter says that this truce was being violated by Muslim 
extremists who, in Karadzic's words, are intolerant of Christian 
holidays. 
  "Dear Mr. Claes, I am deeply moved by your concern about the 
violations of the Christmas truce," President Radovan Karadzic 
says in his letter. He further stresses that, in this civil 
war, as in the previous two World Wars, the Serbs are exposed to 
vicious attacks by their neighbors of different denominations, 
especially during Orthodox Christian holidays. 
  Underlining that the Serbs would be thrilled if the Muslims 
ceased their military activities, the republic of Srpska 
president expressed his hope that Willy Claes, as chairman of 
the European Union's council, could influence the Muslim side to 
accept the peace plan drawn up thanks to Serb concessions.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Radovan Karadzic, president of the </F>
republic of Srpska, by Momir Brkic in Belgrade "shortly before" 
the news program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Brkic] Good evening, Mr. President. 
  [Karadzic] Good evening. 
  [Brkic] Could you summarize for the listeners of Belgrade 
Radio the events concerning peace negotiations on the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and express your expectations for 1994. 
  [Karadzic] First, I want to congratulate this official, 
international new year to all citizens of the Serbian lands, 
particularly the fighters on the defense lines of the Serbian 
lands, although I think that there will be opportunities to 
congratulate them on our own traditional Serbian Orthodox New 
Year. I want to congratulate them and thank them on behalf of 
all those whom they have saved and on behalf of the sacred and 
great aim that they are accomplishing by risking their youth and 
their lives. I also want other citizens to see the 
centuries-old aim of the Serbian people being realized next 
year, namely common life in a common state. 
  1993 has certainly been a year of great tests for the Serbs, 
because the world has found itself out of balance and to some 
extent off track, as all things in physics and nature fall off 
track when they are out of balance. The interests of major 
powers are simply congealed and, unfortunately, the Serbian 
people and their state have again found themselves on the path 
of big powers, above all on the path of German interests in 
Europe. 
  This year was marked by the brutal and unscrupulous 
realization of the big powers' aims, the total lack of 
international law, the absence of any scruples, and great 
dangers for the Serbian people with unprecedented threats. I 
think that the past year was also a year for Russia's gradual 
recovery. This was also a year in which many Orthodox countries 
realized what was going on and extended either more or less 
support to the Serbian people and Serbia. 
  Certain changes and improvements for our benefit also 
happened in Europe, because there are conflicting interests in 
Europe itself. The brutal policy of Germany has opened the eyes 
of, above all, the British, who have realized what is going on. 
Unfortunately, this policy has even more firmly tied the French 
to Germany. This was a year in which we withstood pressure 
exerted on us because of the Vance-Owen plan, which we rejected, 
a year in which President Clinton assumed his post, a year in 
which he had to bear the burden left behind by the previous 
administration, the burden of anti- Serbian views and attitudes. 
We also witnessed the United States slightly distancing itself 
from the crisis in Yugoslavia this year. 
  In brief, this was a year that will be remembered by the 
Serbian people for unprecedented pressure, which they withstood, 
as well as unprecedented dignity and resistance of the Serbian 
people. 
  Next year, we expect relations in the European Union and the 
world as a whole to further differentiate themselves. We expect 
uniformity to be restored to some extent. We expect the United 
States to concentrate on Asia and we expect many European 
countries, even some from the European Union, to try to oppose 
German domination. We expect Russia to become stronger and 
declare its interests in the Balkans, which also affects the 
Serbs, and we expect Greece to invest a great deal of effort in 
the first half of next year on settling the Yugoslav crisis -- 
particularly the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Brkic] Mr. President, at the end of our conversation, I 
would like to thank you on behalf of the First Program of 
Belgrade Radio on the exceptional cooperation during 1993, 
cooperation that enabled our listeners to always be timely 
informed on what was happening in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
the international scene, and at the negotiations. You 
personally made a great contribution. 
  Finally, we hope that peace will be established in this 
region and that you appear on our programs more as a poet than a 
politician, because, as Branko Miljkovic said, he who does not 
listen to a poem will have to listen to a storm. 
  [Karadzic] Thank you very much. I must say that you deserve 
more thanks than we do. Radio and Television of Serbia and, 
thus, Belgrade and Novi Sad Radios have been closely following 
us and our struggle since 1990. They saw that this struggle was 
just and did not spare any efforts to help us. We are brothers 
and perhaps words of gratitude from each side are superfluous. 
I believe that this is what makes us a nation, one being. It 
is good that gratitude exists on both sides. 
  [Brkic] Thank you and good luck.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] The guest of our news broadcast this 
evening is Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic. 
Good evening, Mr. Silajdzic. We have seen what the 
humanitarian situation in our country is like. [passage omitted] 
  News has reached us from Croatia on the announcement of some 
kind of military intervention by the Croatian Army in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Croatian President Franjo Tudjman warns 
that, as he puts it, the continued offensive by the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army in central Bosnia could call into 
question the continuation of the peace negotiations scheduled 
for 18 January. What do you think about that? 
  [Silajdzic] Unfortunately, the Croatian Army has already 
been 
intervening in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is well known to us and 
to international circles, to those who are interested in the 
truth. The Croatian Army is indeed present in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, particularly in central Bosnia. The 
Croatian armed forces, including people and resources, have been 
present in Bosnia-Herzegovina for a long time. But even so, we 
are surprised by the openness of Croatian diplomacy regarding 
the preparations for the new intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  They want to achieve two [as heard] things: They want to 
justify the intervention already under way, they want to justify 
possible future actions, and they want to distract the attention 
of the world public from the notorious fact that the Croatian 
extremists, with the help of some circles from Croatia and the 
Croatian Army, have committed a genocide, particularly in 
Herzegovina, starting in Prozor, against the Bosnian [word 
indistinct] population. This is an attempt to divert the world 
public's attention from that fact and from the fact that Croatia 
is intervening in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  I think that [word indistinct] intervention....[pauses] I 
have information about a large-scale mobilization, that it will 
certainly not allow the preace process [words indistinct]. 
  [Announcer] What is your message for those who are watching 
or listening to our program who are on the threshold of a new 
war year in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is less than four hours 
away? 
  [Silajdzic] A new year is usually connected with wishes and 
greetings. My wish is for us to have peace next year, and I 
would like to extend greetings to all of you for all the 
achievements. I think that we have achieved a miracle and that 
we are achieving a miracle which the whole world is talking 
about. Greetings especially to our [word indistinct] who are in 
their (?trenches) this evening defending their country for their 
children and for all of us against the well armed enemy who 
keeps getting help, and who has enjoyed the support of [words 
indistinct] so far. 
  The world community has intervened in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 
favor of the aggressor. The world community has failed to 
fulfill its promise as far as the victim is concerned and we are 
rightly asking ourselves, or better still we are asking those 
who make decisions in the world community: What right have they 
not to allow us to defend ourselves? 
  To all the others in these countries we wish peace and a 
year 
of [word indistinct]. [passage omitted: greetings to families 
who lost their nearest and dearest; Silajdzic says it is an 
honor to die for one's country; mentions five victims of 
Sarajevo shelling today] 
  To all in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in which there will always be 
room for everyone, as before -- regardless of nationality and 
religion -- and to those outside Bosnia-Herzegovina, I wish 
peace above all.

  [Text] The Defense Ministry of the Croat Republic of 
Herceg-Bosna pointed out in a special statement today that 
Muslim fundamentalists from the ranks of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Army have committed the greatest crime yet in their brutal 
aggression against the Croat population of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and its ancestral homes. The fate of the mass execution grounds 
in Uzdol, Maljin, Doljani, Trusina, Grabovica, and Mostar has 
befallen the village of Krizancevo near Vitez. 
  According to well-informed sources close to UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces], 50 of the 53 Croats abducted by Muslim 
fundamentalists in Krizancevo last week were brutally murdered 
while three are prisoners in a Zenica jail. A mass grave 
containing the remains of 35 massacred Croats has been found in 
Preocica while another one located in no-man's-land between the 
Muslim forces and Croatian Defense Council units contains the 
bodies of another 15, the statement says. 
  The Muslim Army is still refusing to allow international 
organizations and UNPROFOR access to the area between Krizancevo 
and positions held by the 3d Corps of the Muslim Army, where the 
Muslims had carried out the massacre. The liaison officer of 
UNPROFOR's British battalion today informed the command of the 
Vitez operational zone that the spokesman for the Muslim Army's 
3d Corps had declared that some 15 bodies of Krizancevo 
villagers could be found near the separation line and that 
another 35 were buried in a mass grave near the Muslim village 
of Preocica between Vitez and Zenica. The liaison officer 
failed to disclose any details about the crime but added that 
the head of the European observers and representatives of the 
International Red Cross were still trying to obtain the 3d 
Corps' permission to carry out an on-the-spot investigation.

  [Text] The defeats suffered by the ustashas on the 
battlefields of Bosnia are most often described by the Croatian 
media as strategic retreats or, when a large number of 
casualties is at issue, as a massacre of civilians. It is 
obvious that Boban and Tudjman would like, in a rather 
masochistic way, to see Croats experiencing something similar to 
Ahmici and Stupni Dol [sites of massacres of Muslim civilians by 
Croat forces]. For several days this country's media have been 
citing a figure of 74 civilians killed in Krizancevo Selo. 
  The West European and other world TV broadcasters who are 
stationed only a few km from this village have not reported a 
single line about this case because they have, of course, found 
nothing to report. 
  Following the lies of the Croatian media, yesterday four 
European agencies, THE DAILY TELEGRAPH, CNN, the BBC, and 
REUTERS visited the site; they saw no trace of any massacre. 
The only thing they witnessed was the fact that the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina fighters in this area had scored yet another 
great military victory.

<F P=106> [Report by Nedzar Leko; passages within quotation marks are </F>
recorded] 
  [Excerpt] Former Pakistani Prime Minister Navaz Sharif, 
who is visiting Bosnia-Herzegovina, held a news conference 
today. Nedzar Leko reports: 
  [Leko] At the beginning of the news conference Navaz Sharif 
explained the purpose of his visit: 
  [Sharif, in English fading into Serbo-Croatian translation] 
"The purpose of my visit to Bosnia is to express solidarity 
with the heroic struggle of the Bosnian people. This is also a 
humanitarian mission, whose aim is to establish the facts. I 
wanted to find out what could be done to lessen the suffering of 
the Bosnians so that I could help the Bosnian cause on the 
political and diplomatic front. 
  "Of course, Bosnia must be given much more attention than 
the 
international community has done so far. The international 
community does not have a clear picture of Bosnia. I am 
referring to a section of the international community, which 
does not support the Bosnian cause in the way it should, not 
even as regards humanitarian aid. The international community 
should be much more active in supporting the Bosnian cause. 
  "We have now seen the situation ourselves. In the past, we 
only heard on television or read in the newspapers that the 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is very grave. It is painful to 
see that the Bosnians are compelled to live in a situation such 
as this, while the world is still not doing anything about it." 
  [Leko] In his introductory speech, Navaz Sharif also spoke 
about the double standards of the world, demanding that an end 
be put to it. 
  [Sharif] "While the victims of aggression, the Bosnians, are 
continuing to suffer, the aggressor is neither being halted nor 
punished. Bosnia is not only an Islamic or European issue. 
This is an international humanitarian issue, because crimes are 
here being committed against humanity and human rights are being 
violated. This must be stopped. 
  "We think that the lifting of the arms of embargo is 
something that should be done so that the Bosnians can defend 
themselves. Also, it must be made possible for humanitarian aid, 
food, medicine, and clothing, to arrive in Bosnian unobstructed. 
These are the main things that should be done with regard to 
Bosnia. This task should be undertaken by the United Nations 
and the international community." 
  [Leko] Replying to journalists' questions on the causes of 
the inefficiency of the Organization of Islamic Countries, Navaz 
Sharif said: 
  [Sharif] "It is a pity that not enough is being done. 
Actually, the international community is rather indifferent, and 
I think that the Organization of Islamic Countries must mobilize 
itself more. Pakistan will play an important role with regard 
to demands for the lifting of the arms embargo. It will not be 
enough only to lift to the embargo. A way must be found to 
deliver it [arms] to Bosnia. The prevention of arms deliveries 
to Bosnia is sheer discrimination and we will use diplomatic 
channels to influence those countries that are opposed to the 
lifting of the embargo into changing their view." [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] In Bosnia General Briquemont, Gen. Morillon's 
successor, is increasingly bitter and is quite open about it. 
The Belgian general said that the activities of the UN force in 
Bosnia were completely paralyzed by the lack of personnel and 
political will. This inefficiency undermined the credibility of 
future UN operations. Interviewed in his office in the UN 
peacekeepers' barracks near Sarajevo hospital, Gen. Briquemont 
wondered whether the leaders of the three warring parties cared 
at all about the fates of their compatriots. They talk only 
about their war aims and objectives, he said, adding: I think 
that they like power above all else. 
  The United Nations, however, is also guilty in the general's 
eyes. It has voted resolution after resolution without giving 
itself the means to implement them effectively. There is a 
yawning gulf, he said, between all the UN resolutions and the 
means made available to implement them on the ground. The 
general estimated that he needed at least a further 10,000 men 
in order to carry out his mission in Bosnia. Instead of that, 
he said, France and Great Britain speak of withdrawing their 
contingents in the spring if there is no sign of solution to the 
conflict.

  [Text] General Jean Cot, UN Protection Force commander in 
the former Yugoslavia, is tired of seeing his men being 
permanently humiliated and shot at without being able to shoot 
back. He believes that western diplomats must now show more 
resolution in the Geneva talks because, he says, this is the 
last straw. General Jean Cot was interviewed on the phone by 
Bertrand Vannier this afternoon: 
  [Begin Cot recording] The last straw is that I have the 
feeling, indeed the conviction, that the Bosnian Serbs reckon 
that we are pawns in their political game. This seems totally 
unacceptable to me. It must be understood that if the 
international community is indeed totally at the service of the 
warring parties to find a solution, it cannot agree to all the 
humiliations that are inflicted on it. We will have to make 
choices. 
  Mr. Stoltenberg and Mr. Owen cannot act in Geneva as if, 
here 
on the ground, we did not have 30,000 soldiers subjected to 
pressures by all and particularly by the Bosnian Serbs. I 
believe that we will have to choose and that we cannot act as 
kind go-betweens in Geneva, in the UN conference halls, while 
abandoning the force, which after all is the armed tool of the 
international community, in its current situation here on the 
ground. [end recording]

  [Text] Army General Rasim Delic, commander of the General 
Staff of the Supreme Command of our Army, addressed the fighters 
of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the citizens of our country. 
Here is what he said in his message; 
  [Begin Delic recording] Behind us is a difficult, war-ridden 
1993 during which the brutal aggression on our homeland 
continued. Despite the unjustly introduced embargo, the fact 
that the world indifferently observed the war horrors in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the difficult conditions in which 
members of the Armed Forces of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina waged the war, they endured in their heroism 
and defended their homeland and people. 
  As a soldier of the Army of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, I would like to wish to all the fighters of 
the Armed Forces, all patriots of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in both 
free and occupied territories, that next year, 1994, will be a 
year of freedom and peace. I want arms in this region to go 
silent. I wish for a just peace for Bosnia-Herzegovina and its 
people. I want people to return to their homes, families, and 
jobs that they performed in peace. Our people -- and by this I 
mean all citizens that consider Bosnia-Herzegovina their 
homeland -- have the right to that because of the sacrifices 
they made in this struggle. 
  Regardless of everything, my message to all fighters is to 
remain firm and ready to stop all future offensive intentions of 
the aggressor. If the peace negotiations fail, we must be ready 
to secure the freedom and peace of our people with arms and, 
above all, enable them to return to their centuries-old hearths. 
  I appeal to all those who have so far not fully participated 
in the struggle not only to fully contribute with arms next 
year, but to also strengthen in all other ways the front of our 
just struggle for the freedom of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  I wish the fighters all the luck in their honorable tasks 
and 
peace and freedom to all citizens of our homeland. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Sarajevo, Jan 1 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic has denied reports by foreign agencies that 
Bosnian Serbs shelled Sarajevo on Friday. In connection with 
agency reports that four civilians were killed and several 
others wounded in Sarajevo, Karadzic told TANJUG that this was a 
new attempt by the Moslems ruthlessly to manipulate the 
international public. 
  "Anyone in the world who has followed this bloody civil war 
at all could have guessed that the Moslem side would stage some 
New Year's gift to the international audience," said Karadzic. 
  "This is by now largely a crime against one's own people, 
which the Moslem leadership has been perpetrating constantly, 
and the international public should finally expose it by 
publishing the naked truth that Moslems do not care even for 
their own citizens since their slogan is -- the end justifies 
the means," said Karadzic. 
  In the meantime, the Bosnian Serb parliament late on Friday 
temporarily ended a regular session. It was ruled that a report 
on the peace talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina, which were held in 
Geneva and Brussels in December, and a debate on this major 
subject of the current session be put off for the next session, 
which has been scheduled for January 10.

  [Text] Bileca, Jan 2 (TANJUG) -- Commander of the Bosnian 
Serb Army's General Staff General Ratko Mladic has said that the 
end of war in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
is not yet in sight despite the Serb side's utmost efforts to 
have peace restored. 
  The Bosnian Serbs have to be ready to protect themselves and 
if forced, to continue the war till final victory, because "our 
enemies, backed by the German factor, the United States and 
Islamic countries, are committed to resuming the war," said 
General Mladic in his new year's and Christmas message. 
  In Bosnia-Herzegovina, the civil war between three 
communities -- Moslem, Serb and Croat -- has been going on for 
more than 20 months now. After the forcible secession of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina from the former Yugoslav Federation and the 
outbreak of the civil war, the Bosnian Serbs and Croats 
proclaimed their national states on their ethnic territories. 
  The Moslem side, however, continues to aspire to a unitary 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in which they would dominate as the most 
populous community. 
  General Mladic assessed that the Bosnian Serb Army, together 
with its people, achieved great results in protecting the Serb 
population and territories last year through their defensive and 
liberation war which had been forced on them. 
  The results achieved on a military plane, the message said, 
were the key presumption for our state and political leadership, 
to struggle internationally for the recognition of the Serb 
republic and for the exercise of their natural law to be masters 
of their own fate in their own home.

  [Text] Sarajevo, Jan 3 (AFP) -- Sarajevo was mainly calm 
early Monday [3 January], although a Christmas truce was still 
being breached in a number of other Bosnian areas, a UN 
spokesman said. Idesbald van Biesebroeck, a spokesman for the 
UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), said the truce, signed on 
December 23 and set to last though January 15, was 
"non-existent." 
  "The last two days have been very quiet in the whole of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, except Sarajevo, Mostar and Bihac," he said. 
In Sarajevo "the situation remains unstable," he said, although 
there was little or no fighting Monday morning. Heavy arms fire 
could be heard at the end of the morning from the north of the 
city, and small arms fire downtown. He said UN observers had 
counted more than 300 shells fired by Sarajevo's Bosnian Serb 
besiegers Sunday, countered by some 30 Bosnian army shells in 
return. 
  In one incident, a Norwegian C-130 Hercules military 
transport aircraft was hit by small arms fire Sunday as it 
prepared to land in Sarajevo, UN High Commissioner for Refugees 
spokesman Ray Wilkinson said Monday. The plane was only 
slightly damaged and the airport remained open. In the past 
similar incidents have led to the suspension of aid flights into 
the Bosnian capital. 
  Eighty percent of the shelling targeted military areas north 
of Sarajevo, including Vogosca, Zuc, and Rajlovac, he said, but 
added that shells had landed on residential areas, killing one 
person and injuring seven. 
  In central Bosnia the situation was mostly calm, except for 
the regions of Busovaca and Dubravica, south of Zenica, 50 
kilometers (30 miles) west of Sarajevo, Wilkinson said. The 
region was the scene of violent mortar and small arms clashes 
between the Moslem-led Bosnian Army and Bosnian Croat (HVO) 
forces Sunday, he added. 
  In the southern city of Mostar, where HVO forces have been 
besieging the Moslem section of town, "the level of military 
activity lowered," van Biesebroeck said. But shooting 
continued, with the Bosnian Croats firing some 20 mortar shells 
into the Moslem eastern sector of the city on Sunday. 
  Fighting had intensified in the northwestern separatist 
Bihac 
enclave between forces loyal to rebel leader Fikret Abdic and 
the Bosnian Government forces, with clashes particularly fierce 
north of the town of Cazin, he said.

  [Text] Two people were killed and six wounded in the free 
part of Mostar in last night's large-caliber artillery attacks 
from Croatian Army and HVO [Croatian Defense Council] positions, 
the 4th Corps press center reports. 
  Today the ustashas directed most of their attacks on Blagaj, 
targeting it with more than 100 destructive shells and causing 
fresh casualties and considerable material damage. This town, 
which is also inhabited by several thousand refugees, was 
targeted by the ustasha artillery for two hours. Fourteen 
people were wounded in these bestial attacks by crazed 
supporters of the vampire from Grude [reference to Herceg-Bosna 
president Mate Boban]. Despite the increasing aggressor attacks 
on the free part of the Mostar municipality, the demarcation 
lines have remain unchanged and firmly controlled by the 4th 
Corps units.

  [Text] In Mostar today passed off relatively peacefully, 
though the political administration of the defense ministry of 
the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, in a special statement this 
evening, notes an irrational act by NATO planes which at 2055 on 
31 December fired at least two short bursts in the direction of 
a Croatian Defense Council [HVO] helicopter, which was flying to 
Nova Bila with the aim of evacuating the wounded from the 
Franciscan hospital. 
  The helicopter was forced to return to base despite the fact 
that advance notice of its flight had been given to the UN 
Protection Force. The act is incomprehensible, the statement 
says, because the Croatian side has made it clear that it would 
support all humanitarian actions -- something which it recently 
confirmed in practice when it allowed a Muslim aid convoy to 
pass through territory controlled by the HVO.

  [Text] The Croatian Defense Council's Vitez operational 
group today warned the UN Protection Forces and other 
international organizations about the consequences of a possible 
explosion of the ammunition factory in Vitez. This factory 
stores explosives and dangerous chemicals, and if it is blown up 
by the defenders or as a result of Muslim shelling everything 
within a 3 km radius would be destroyed. 
  A document issued by the Vitez operational group also warns 
that toxic gases would affect people living from 2 to 15 km from 
the factory. Snow, rain, and fog could reduce the effect of 
toxic clouds to a certain extent, but in any case the safety 
zone for the population of the area would be at least 20 km away 
from the epicenter of the explosion, the Vitez operational group 
warns in the document.

  [Excerpts] Bihac, 2 January (TANJUG) -- Inter-Muslim 
clashes in Cazinska Krajina continued today along all 
demarcation lines, but were of somewhat less intensity than over 
the past few days, local Muslim information media report. 
  Muslim radio in Bihac reports that forces of the army of the 
autonomous province of Western Bosnia were in action today, 
using light weapons along demarcation lines in the immediate 
vicinity of Cazin; no mention was made of the killed or injured. 
The same source adds that during the day there were also 
clashes near Todorovo, Sturlic, and Trzacka Rastela. [passage 
omitted] 
  The Muslim media in the Bihac area report that there is real 
chaos in Bihac itself. Clashes between Izetbegovic's Muslims 
and the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] are still going on, and 
relations between the HVO, commanded by Major General Vlado 
Santic, who is otherwise a follower of Fikret Abdic, and the 
Croatian Democratic Community, led by Dr. Ante Santic, are 
increasingly tense. The most distinguished people on the 
opposing sides are being liquidated in the town. There are an 
increasing number of incidents of shots being fired from light 
weapons and the town reverberates with the noise of explosions.

  [Text] Belgrade, January 2 (TANJUG) -- Heavy fighting 
continued in the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
over the new year holidays, despite an agreement reached by the 
three warring sides to halt hostilities from December 23 until 
January 15. Moslem forces continued attacks on Serb positions 
and villages on fronts in the wider region of Doboj in northern 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Doboj operative group of the Bosnian 
Serb army said on Sunday [2 January]. Moslem forces were the 
most active in the eastern part of the Ozren front, the source 
said. The villages of Milino Selo and Vozuca took the brunt of 
the attack. Moslem forces attacked Serb defence positions in 
the region of Foca and Cajnice in southeastern 
Bosnia-Herzegovina from the direction of Gorazde on Saturday 
night, the Herzegovina Corps in Bileca said on Sunday morning. 
  Moslem-Croat conflicts also continued last night and this 
morning in southern Bosnia-Herzegovina and in its central part. 
Croatian radio reported on Sunday morning that Moslem forces 
last night attacked Bosnian Croat positions in the region of 
Mostar with infantry and artillery weaponry. Moslem Radio 
Sarajevo said that Croatian forces fired more than a hundred 
shells on Blagaj in southern Bosnia-Herzegovina on new year's 
eve and on Saturday.

  [Text] Sarajevo, Jan 2 (AFP) -- Bosnian wage earners are to 
pay 10 percent of their net income towards the costs of 
defending and rebuilding their country, Bosnian television said 
Sunday [2 January]. The new defence and reconstruction tax, 
which is effective as of this month, was agreed in a law passed 
by Bosnia's collective presidency, the television said. It will 
be levied on Bosnians living in Bosnia-Herzegovina and on 
Bosnian nationals working abroad. Observers noted were the main 
targets of the new legislation [sentence as received]. A 
presidency statement said: "Bosnian workers abroad will thus be 
able to participate in an organised way in efforts to defend the 
country."

<F P=106> [Report on New Year's message extended by King Mihai to </F>
Romanian nation on 30 December -- place not given] 
  [Text] Romania's former sovereign, Mihai I, sent a message 
to the country on the occasion of the New Year. 
  After recalling the events four years ago when our people 
began to free themselves from the dictatorship and communism, as 
well as the difficult work, so that the hope that was born from 
the blood shed in December 1989 may materialize, and after 
emphasizing that, due to the support by friends abroad, Romania 
was admitted to the big European family and that each Romanian 
citizen will thus be able to appeal to the Council of Europe 
every time the institutions in Romania violate the regulations 
regarding human rights, that the United States has granted us 
most-favored-nation status -- the advantageous customs regime 
granted to friendly countries -- former King Mihai expresses his 
gladness that, through his public interventions and personal 
contacts, he was able to contribute to the recognition of the 
place due to Romania within the community of nations. 
  The message then emphasizes, quote: Despite these efforts 
made everywhere in order to support you in your struggle for 
dignity, freedom, and prosperity, our country continues to 
flounder in complete misery, unquote. Noting that everywhere 
there is goodwill, creative energy, considerable riches and 
capabilities, former King Mihai expresses the desire that all 
these things be freed and united to serve the country for the 
benefit of all. He stresses that unity cannot be achieved 
without national reconciliation. 
  From the bottom of my heart, through my prayers, and through 
my wishes, which I extend to you today, the message continues, I 
want to express the desire and will to be among you and with 
you. Let us contribute to conciliation and unity, and let us 
help all Romanians within the country and outside it. 
  With belief and confidence in the future, the message ends 
with the following wishes: May Romania be reborn for the 
benefit of all Romanians. So may the Lord help us.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu by </F>
Cristiana Terenche; place and date not given: "The Unted States 
Has Opened a Door for Romania and on Its Threshold Stands a 
Friend"] 
  [Text] [Terenche] Mr. Minister, when you left for 
Washington, your agenda did not include certain issues that 
emerged shortly before your visit -- the pronouncement of the 
sentence in Tiraspol, the results of the elections in Russia, 
and so forth, which immediately changed the framework of talks... 
  [Melescanu] Indeed, the meeting in Washington was scheduled 
to take place in the month of October and in his letter of 
invitation Mr. Warren Christopher said that we were going to see 
each other to celebrate, together, the granting of the 
most-favored-nation status and to discuss tangible ways and 
means for cooperation whereby Romania could benefit; this, 
actually, meant returning to normal relations of partnership 
with the United States of America. Due to Mr. Christopher's 
schedule, this visit was postponed all the time, and thus the 
events happened to which you referred; to this we may also add 
certain reactions by the American public to domestic actions. 
Unfortunately, there were things that modified the framework 
initially established for this official visit. I do not want to 
conceal the fact that great attention was paid there to the 
unveiling of the statue of Marshal Antonescu in Slobozia, which 
was viewed as a certain escalation of ultranationalist political 
positions... 
  It was obvious to me that there is concern for developments 
in Romania; this is proven by the particular impact this 
unveiling had on groups of Jewish people in the United States. 
I tried to explain that the government was not involved in this 
event. I have said and I want to repeat that Marshal Antonescu 
is a very controversial figure; there are still numerous facets 
that have not been clarified. He is perceived by Jewish 
organizations as Hitler's man, who caused the death of Jews in 
Romania. By other segments of society, however, he is perceived 
as the man who reclaimed Romanian territories and who recovered 
our national integrity. And he is also perceived as a victim of 
the communist regime. In the United States, however, this is 
viewed as an extremist nationalist event that proves that the 
image we enjoy here, at home, is different from our image across 
the ocean. 
  [Terenche] But you still returned very optimistic... 
  [Melescanu] We discussed two big problems. One is linked to 
the question of bilateral relations within the framework of 
which we noted signs of entering a new and different stage of 
Romanian-U.S. relations. Second, we conducted lengthy 
discussions on the consequences of the developments to which you 
referred and on the possible orientations of our government. 
  [Terenche] What does this mean in concrete terms? 
  [Melescanu] Concretely speaking, it means a firmer 
involvement of ours in efforts that are being made, on the one 
hand, to stabilize this area and support democratic developments 
in all countries, including the countries of the former USSR. 
On the other hand, it means achieving, at the domestic level, a 
broad political base of a center leaning that will permit the 
continuation and speeding up of the economic reform program. 
The Americans insist very much on broad support for the 
population in the reform process. Consequently, in their view 
this process has to take place under such conditions as will 
ensure support for the political forces at all levels. It is 
clear-cut that the United States of America has opened a door 
for Romania and that on its threshold stands a friend. And it 
depends solely on us to capitalize on the possibilities we are 
offered. Thus, a fund of $50 million was set up in support of 
the development of private enterprises in Romania. It is not a 
big fund, but rather a symbolic one; its merit, however, is to 
encourage investors. For, the moment the American state 
participates with 10 percent in an investment, this will surely 
attract private investors. Thus, the multiplying effect is 
greater. The second part of the visit refers to the support the 
United States guarantees for us to preserve Romania's stability 
and security, and even territorial integrity. I am not talking 
of formal, judicial guarantees. We are now in a different 
stage, one in which no treaties of mutual assistance are 
concluded as we used to do formerly. I am talking of a very 
clear-cut involvement of the U.S. Administration in what we 
would term Romania's security and stability, because this is a 
question that interests the United States. 
  [Terenche] Is this where the "Partnership for Peace" 
relationship comes in? 
  [Melescanu] Mr. Warren Christopher told us that their 
political concept that is now being applied in the "new 
democracies" is incorporated from the point of view of security 
into the concept "Partnership for Peace," which they view as a 
transition stage in relations with NATO. This means that the 
immediate admission to the Alliance, as those working at the 
Pentagon said more directly, is not possible from a technical 
point of view. Similarly, NATO's expansion should not take 
place in a fashion that would give the Russians the impression 
that it is directed against them. We were told very clearly 
both at the State Department, the Pentagon, and the National 
Security Council that we will be included in the program, that 
we will even conduct some consultations on concrete ways and 
means of applying the concept of "Partnership for Peace," which 
also implies tangible obligations. Military obligations of 
cooperation, and so forth. 
  [Terenche] Nevertheless, what is the explanation of the 
fact that Romania is constantly eschewed by U.S. officials? 
  [Melescanu] A position toward Romania is valid. Therefore, 
I believe it is necessary to conduct a dialogue at the summit 
level and I mentioned the possibility of a meeting in Prague. 
Or an official visit, for which purpose I extended an 
invitation to President Clinton to visit Romania. The excuse 
was a full program and I am convinced that it was not a 
circumstantial problem. We have overcome the stage in which 
political dialogue at the summit level was a question of 
reservations by the other side... 
  [Terenche] How did the Americans react to the election 
results in the Russian Federation? 
  [Melescanu] I arrived there when things had begun to calm 
down. I said that not the result, but the percentage surprised 
us. Obviously, in Russia there is very broad support for 
tackling the reform other than in a democratic way. The 
conclusion I drew was that an alarm signal has been sounded and 
this should make the Americans pay greater attention to the 
support granted to Russia and the East European countries. 
  [Terenche] What was the reaction to the death sentence 
pronounced in the Ilie Ilascu case? 
  [Melescanu] The entire Romanian community in the United 
States rallied and energetically supported the Ilascu case. 
They took steps and put pressure on the U.S. Administration. 
  [Terenche] And what was the result? 
  [Melescanu] The result is a very serious involvement of the 
Administration. We have already received serious signals in 
this respect from Moscow. In the United States it is very 
important when an ethnic community rallies and demands something 
from the Administration. For ourselves, however, that is for 
relations with Russia this has, unfortunately, had a negative 
effect. The postponement of the visit by Defense Minister 
Grachev is a signal in this respect. And such signals have 
become increasingly numerous: For example, the postponement of 
the meeting on the treasury or the consultations on the 
treaty... I personally do not think that we are guilty of 
anything, because what happened in Tiraspol was shocking for the 
public, irrespective of political leaning. People were shocked 
and said so. But this created a negative moment in 
Romanian-Russian relations as far as economic integration is 
concerned. It is important for us to relaunch bilateral 
relations with our neighbors: With Bulgaria, Ukraine, and, of 
course, with the Russian Federation. Such moments affect us. 
They have a much more centralized system than we, where every 
economic element has a political effect. 
  [Terenche] You also hold the position of minister state 
secretary, that is a sort of deputy prime minister. What are 
you doing in this capacity? 
  [Melescanu] A sort of... is well put. We have the feeling, 
somehow, that we could do more to brief and ensure the access of 
parliamentarians and politicians to the foreign policy elements 
such as the European conventions. 
  [Terenche] But here we can also mention the way in which one 
can violate the freedom of citizens to travel, a right enshrined 
in the European conventions, which are so little known by our 
authorities... I am referring to the refusal of granting a visa 
to His Majesty King Mihai to visit the country on 1 December. 
  [Melescanu] There are two aspects: First, there is the 
formal one, meaning the need to clearly settle procedures. 
Irrespective of what will happen, of how we will develop 
politically, we have to try to solve the problem of the monarchy 
in its entirety. I want you to understand me: It is not the 
visa that presents a problem, but the political decision on the 
king's participation in some of the events in the country. I 
understand that there was an opening at Christmas, but there was 
no answer. I am not talking about the fact that we are a 
republic; that is clear and stipulated in the constitution. 
  [Terenche] But nothing is nailed... 
  [Melescanu] Of course. But I do not understand why we do 
not see the good side of things in this respect. A major part 
of the Romanians, who left the country after the war, did not do 
so because they had it too good. If we start from the idea that 
now we need the support of Romanians everywhere, I do not see 
why we should not consider the possibility of using the royal 
institution. Especially since reference was made to abiding by 
the constitution. This is why we are the advocates of solving 
this problem in its entirety. We need the support of numerous 
capitals through contacts. 
  [Terenche] Including through royal houses... 
  [Melescanu] Why not? If they can help us! Our situation is 
such that we need any help available. At the domestic political 
level, I do not think that we have an overproduction of capable 
people, so that we do not know what to do with them. Therefore, 
we cannot ask anyone to change his opinions and friendships. 
Thus, both at the domestic level and the foreign one, we have 
to rally our efforts in order to implement our basic objectives. 
For, misery is no political capital. 
  [Terenche] Were these arguments insufficient when needed? 
  [Melescanu] You have to know that each one tried to present 
his point of view as best as he could. Finally, however, a 
conclusion is formed on the basis of all opinions, and thus we 
cannot always win. I, however, have the impression that there 
are developments on both sides, although there are 
irreconcilable positions. There is the basic problem of the 
abdication act and that of elections on the basis of which the 
constitution was adopted. But even if each one continues to 
have the same position, one can seek ways and means to 
cooperate, which is the most important thing. 
  [Terenche] Mr. Minister, how did you react, first as a 
private person and then as an official person, to the idea 
promoted by Mr. Adrian Nastase that the minister of foreign 
affairs should be involved in the political, party activity? 
  [Melescanu] I think that it is a correct and principled 
position, which is being supported by numerous politicians in 
Romania. It is a correct solution in the sense of the political 
responsibility of ministers when governing. I think that this 
is a normal thing in a democratic society. The only question in 
our country at this point is to what extent our society is 
sufficiently structured for the application of these principles. 
In actual fact, I and the other ministers, who are "non-party 
members" are involved in the government program in which we 
participate. I cannot say that I am a minister who enjoys full 
freedom of movement, but I am a minister within a PDSR 
[Socialist Democracy Party of Romania] government. Since, 
however, I am not fully involved, this situation offers me 
certain advantages in the sense of getting broader support. If 
I had a certain political color, a dialogue could be refused at 
a certain point, although this refusal would not have anything 
to do with my activity...

  [Text] At today's ordinary session, Romania's Government 
adopted the following statement in connection with the aberrant 
and insulting stands made by the ultranationalist Russian leader 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy against Romania and the Romanian people. 
  Our country has recently been included in the cascade of 
insults, warnings, ultimatums, and revanchist slogans recently 
launched by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal 
Democratic Party of the Russian Federation, the statement reads. 
In the most insulting way, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy went so far as 
to state that Romania is an artificial state, consisting of 
Italian Gypsies who seized territories from Bulgaria, Hungary, 
and Russia. Although these pronouncements look more like the 
outcome of a certain pathological rather than political state of 
mind, such public statements should not be ignored at all, since 
they can become starting points for developments that might have 
nefarious consequences for the countries and peoples of Europe 
and for humankind in general. 
  Romania's Government, the statement reads, firmly rejects 
and 
condemns such beliefs revived from a propaganda arsenal, which 
has bloodied the entire planet 50 years ago. In our entire 
history, no one has dared to insult the Romanian people in such 
an indescribable manner. No criminal plotter against our 
national being and identity has ever dared to utter such dirty 
invectives against us. We have never allowed and will never 
allow anyone to hurt our national dignity. Romania and the 
Romanian people have never tolerated and will not tolerate such 
aberrations. 
  Romania's Government unanimously expresses this steadfast 
position vis-a-vis Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's irresponsible insults 
and is convinced that all the country's citizens and all 
Romanian political groupings will have the same intransigent 
attitude of condemning and rejecting such a serious affront. 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's irresponsible statements are 
actually 
an attempt on our national security. Other extremist statements 
of his made about European matters are quite inflammatory and 
jeopardize the stability and security in our region and Europe. 
This fully justifies our concern with defending our national 
security interests, especially now on the eve of the forthcoming 
NATO high-level meeting. 
  At the same time, Romania's Government again points out that 
our country has supported and continues to support the 
democratic process in the Russian Federation and President Boris 
Yeltsin's reform program. We also consider their success as a 
guarantee for security and stability in Europe and the world. 
We are interested in developing good relations with the Russian 
Federation. Therefore, we express the hope that the president 
and Government of the Russian Federation will distance 
themselves most clearly from Zhirinovskiy's positions, including 
his insulting statements against Romania. 
  We express the conviction that the realistic and reforming 
forces in the Russian Federation will prevail in the positive 
evolutions toward democratic reconstruction, so as to bar the 
way of extremism and ultranationalism, facilitate the 
development of a Europe of peace and good understanding, and 
further consolidate the traditional Romanian-Russian relations 
-- the declaration of the Romanian Government, which we received 
by fax from the spokesman of the executive branch, concludes.

  [Text] President Ion Iliescu met with a delegation of the 
Romanian Social Democratic Party [PSDR] at Cotroceni Palace 
today. The PSDR delegation consisted of Messrs. Sergiu Cunescu, 
Constantin Avramescu, Radu Gheciu, Radu Dumitrescu, and Emil 
Putin. Today's meeting was also attended by Ambassador Traian 
Chebeleu, presidential adviser and spokesman of the presidency, 
and Mr. Paul Dobrescu, presidential adviser. 
  After the meeting, PSDR President Sergiu Cunescu made the 
following statement: 
  [Begin Cunescu recording] We presented our viewpoint on this 
declared desire to conclude a political pact. We said that a 
political pact can only be achieved between political forces 
that are sincerely interested in moving along the road of 
reform. We did not discuss issues related to the formation of a 
new government but only to putting together a new parliamentary 
majority. This parliamentary majority should only consist of 
the groups from the Democratic Convention [CDR] and the 
parliamentary group of the Social Democracy Party of Romania 
[PDSR]. Since these two alone cannot put together a 
sufficiently broad and stable majority, which should not be at 
the mercy of several deputies who may occasionally decide to 
change sides, we believe that another important parliamentary 
group should also participate in this effort, namely the 
Democratic Party (National Salvation Front) [PD(FSN)], which one 
can count on as a reformist group. We cannot rely on other 
groups if we want to achieve this kind of stability; maybe one 
could take into consideration certain individuals from the 
Romanian National Unity Party [PUNR]. 
  Therefore, if this new parliamentary majority is put 
together, we could proceed -- with this majority and the 
respective parties -- to negotiate a political pact that 
contains the principles and main actions for a more stable 
political activity in the future. If such a pact can be 
eventually achieved, then a second part should follow, namely 
negotiations on a social pact with the important social factors 
in our country, particularly the trade unions, students, and 
other social sectors. Therefore, we are talking about two 
documents: a political one, to be concluded among parties, and 
a social one, to be concluded with the trade unions. There are 
possibilities for reaching this goal, if the current majority 
party shows the political will to move along these lines. In 
order for this to happen, the majority party must accept certain 
new things and other attitudes than the ones it is practicing 
today. 
  The discussions also focused on the statements made 
yesterday 
by PDSR Executive President Adrian Nastase, who outlined his 
conditions for such a pact. He raised the issue of the 
observance of the Constitution. We agree with his point and 
have always said that -- although we did not vote in favor of 
the Constitution for various reasons -- we will observe it, 
literally. As you know, we are in favor of a parliamentary 
republic. The second condition he raised was the need to 
observe the republican form of state. Again, we have no 
objection to that, since we are republicans -- that is, we are 
in favor of a parliamentary republic. Third, he raised the 
astounding issue of the return of the nationalized houses to 
their owners. He should not have raised this issue, but since 
he did, we also discussed it and stressed that we will support a 
law on restoring the nationalized houses to their owners, but 
that this law will not be able to solve all cases from the very 
beginning, just the most blatant cases. The situation should be 
further dealt with gradually by successively promulgating new 
laws that ensure that the tenants are never at a disadvantage 
and are secure in their homes. All instances should be dealt 
with individually in keeping with the justification and strength 
of each case. 
  We also discussed various other political issues. We stated 
that we plan to stand by our overall principles and will remain 
faithful to the CDR, since we believe in it and actually 
initiated it. From the various notes the president took of our 
conversation, we hope that he retained many of our ideas and 
that the two aforementioned pacts can be achieved. 
  We did not raise the issue of the government, which can be 
an 
outcome of later endeavors. The main thing is to put together a 
new parliamentary majority. [end recording]

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 28/12/1993 -- Ioan Solcanu, vice 
chairman of the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR], 
maintained at the party's news conference on 28 December that 
the ruling party was not sticking to power, so it would not 
allow to be blackmailed. Oliviu Gherman, chairman of PDSR, 
reiterated in that context the program-like principles 
(observance of the Constitution, of the republic as form of 
government, and of the non-enforcement of the restitutio in 
integrum principle,) which the PDSR means to be truthful to. 
The role of the recent meetings at Cotroceni, Ioan Solcanu 
stressed, is to gather a picture of the political, economic, and 
social situation as seen by the other parliamentary parties. 
PDSR, Solcanu added, will not give up the portfolios of defense 
and national security, foreign affairs, and the interior if a 
mixed government is formed. 
  Ion Solcanu admitted that the people's living standard 
declined over this year of PDSR rule, which was the reason of 
erosion of the government's popularity and credibility. At the 
same time, he said that although the government took a string of 
unpopular measures, engaged by the previous governments and 
imposed "by the seriousness with which it approached the 
continuation of the process of reform, it however neglected its 
own public image." He considered it necessary that the 
government should be given between 30 and 60 minutes a week on 
the air with the national television, in order to be able to 
correctly inform the population.

<F P=106> [By Mihaela Rodina] </F>
  [Text] Bucharest, Jan 3 (AFP) -- The room is cluttered with 
old furniture, and yellowing photographs of the stars of 
yesteryear look down from the walls of what seems a fitting 
headquarters for Romania's National Party of the Right (NPR). 
It is one of three extreme right-wing parties that have been 
created since communist dictator Nicolae Ceaucescu was toppled 
and executed in December 1989. Party president Radu Sorescu 
told AFP: "Anti-semitism is old hat, these days we must fight 
against immigrants and gypsies." Sorescu, a 30-year-old former 
teacher of the Romanian language, told AFP he had spent two 
years ensconced in a library to bring his party's doctrine to 
fruition. 
  Romanian President Ion Iliescu last July asked the state 
prosecutor to check on the legality of the NPR and two other 
parties, the Movement for Romania and the Fatherland Party, 
worried at the spread of apologists for fascism. The prosecutor 
ruled in November that the parties were law-abiding, a 
declaration immediately contradicted by a newspaper that got 
hold of the NPR's internal constitution. 
  That document stipulated that members had to be of Romanian 
origin, would wear the brown uniform of the Nazi army the 
Sturmabteilung (SA) and could win the Nazi Iron Cross for 
exceptional service. Despite provision for a Hitler salute in 
the constitution, Sorescu said his supporters never gave such a 
salute. But he did not deny the similarities between his dogma 
and that of the Iron Guard, the pro-Nazi Romanian movement which 
was active in the 1930s. 
  He maintains that he has retained only its "good points", 
citing nationalism and discipline, and denounces the "mistakes" 
the Iron Guard made before it was banned in 1941, like 
assassinating opponents and deporting Jews and gypsies. "Many 
people share our views, but are afraid to express them openly," 
he said, comparing the position of the NPR with that of French 
ultra-nationalist Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front. 
  "Everybody called him a fascist, until the government 
started 
adopting the same stance on foreigners," he said. The party's 
quarterly THE NEW RIGHT has a print-run of 5,000, and it is 
snapped up like hot cakes. Its pages are brimful of attacks on 
democracy -- "a utopia turned to anarchy" -- and of threats 
against gypsies, who are blamed for rising crime. 
  One of the latest editions had an interview with Le Pen, who 
said that France could no longer be a haven for foreigners. 
"Ninety percent of Romanians hate gypsies," Sorescu said by way 
of explanation for the magazine's success. 
  The NPR claims it is non-violent, but envisages legal moves 
against those it judges to be incapable of integration, and 
recommends sterilising gypsy women and creating "reserves" for 
the "most recalcitrant" members of that minority. According to 
the human rights organisation Peoples in Peril, based at 
Goettingen in Germany, there have been more than 20 serious 
attacks on gypsies since the fall of Ceaucescu. 
  The last was on September 20, when two gypsies were lynched 
and a third was burnt alive in his shack at Hadareni, 400 
kilometres north of here, by a mob out to avenge a Romanian 
stabbed to death by a gypsy. Still in its embryonic stage, the 
Romanian right garnered less than 0.2 percent of the vote at the 
last general election in September 1992. But Sorescu is 
confident his party will score much higher the next time round.

  [Text] After meeting with representatives of the Socialist 
Party of Labor [PSM], President Ion Iliescu received leadership 
members of the Public Ministry. Aside from Romania's General 
Prosecutor, Vasile Manea Dragulin, the meeting was also attended 
by Minister of National Defense Lieutenant General Niculae 
Spiroiu; Minister of Interior George Ioan Danescu; Minister of 
Justice Petre Ninosu; and by the director of the Romanian 
Intelligence Service [SRI], Virgil Magureanu. 
  At the end of the discussions, Vasile Manea Dragulin stated 
to the press that the issues discussed were the stage of legal 
investigations on the December 1989 events and the situation of 
corruption in general terms. It was emphasized that a critical 
and serious examination of the results achieved so far was made. 
  The Prosecutor General specified that organizational 
measures 
have been taken in connection with people, who will be involved 
in carrying out activities regarding such cases and verifying 
certain cases in which -- upon the request of the press, of 
other institutions or people directly involved -- solutions were 
adopted, which were termed as illegal and unfounded. He added 
that firm promises exist on behalf of the SRI that very many 
data will be passed on to the Public Ministry by the end of 
January and that it is hoped that state institutions dealing 
with this kind of information, such as the specialized 
departments of the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of National 
Defense, will cooperate. 
  Asked when it will be possible for the public to be provided 
with information on the stage of investigations, Vasile Manea 
Dragulin answered that during January the military prosecutors' 
offices will report on what has been done and what is in the 
process of being solved in 1993, materials which will be 
distributed to all mass media.

  [Text] After today's three-hour consultations at Cotroceni 
Palace between President Ion Iliescu and a delegation of the 
National Romanian Unity Party [PUNR], we asked PUNR Chairman 
Gheorghe Funar to summarize the contents of their talks. 
  [Begin Funar recording] We appreciate this initiative by 
President Ion Iliescu. PUNR supports the idea of concluding a 
political, social, and economic pact and will associate itself 
with the PDAR [Democratic Agrarian Party of Romania], which 
intends to sign the pact. 
  I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to all 
political parties, especially those of the opposition, to 
associate themselves with us and sign the mentioned pact, which 
we badly need in these difficult times. We need national unity, 
and I hope that all political parties will prove to be 
sufficiently mature to go beyond all party ambitions and lend a 
helping hand to conclude the pact and especially implement it. 
  I would also like to mention the second issue for 
discussion, 
which we have been invited to by President Iliescu, namely the 
International Monetary Fund memorandum and the discussion on it 
in parliament. We were happy to see that President Iliescu 
appreciates PUNR's petition that was issued a few days ago, by 
which it requests that the government should come to parliament 
and present the details on the accords concluded over the past 
years with the IMF, their consequences, as well as the accord 
planned for 1994 and 1995. We are certain that the prime 
minister [Nicolae Vacaroiu] will personally come to parliament 
to present those details so that our lawmakers can get 
acquainted with them and decide accordingly. In this way, the 
whole country can learn about the details, since many things 
related to those accords are presently unclear. [end recording]

Franjo Tudjman stated Thursday [30 December] that the offensive 
of the Bosnian Moslems threatened the survival of the Croatian 
enclaves in central Bosnia and added he expected international 
pressure to prevent this, REUTERS has reported. In a television 
interview, Tudjman, whom the British news agency termed "patron 
of ethnic Croat forces in Bosnia's war," accused the army of the 
Bosnian Moslem Government of trying to push through to the 
Adriatic Sea and split Croatian territory. 
  "They even have plans to push through to the sea and split 
Croatia. Such plans are similar to the Serbs' plans. We can 
expect the world will put more pressure of the Moslem leadership 
(to stop fighting," Tudjman said in the interview. A civil war 
raged for 20 months in Bosnia between the local Moslems, Serbs 
and Croats. Regular troops of the Republic of Croatia were 
fighting on the side of the Bosnian Croats.

<F P=106> [New Year address by Czech President Vaclav Havel; place and </F>
date not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Dear follow citizens: The coming into being of 
the independent Czech Republic a year ago was for most of us 
more of a reason for reflection than for celebration. We asked 
ourselves what the division of what until then had been a common 
home would mean for all us, both the Czechs and Slovaks; what 
would this mean for Central Europe? Were we to understand this 
as a success of national aspirations or as a defeat in the 
struggle for a common state? 
  I believe the first year of the existence of our new state 
has dispersed a larger part of last year's concerns. Our 
republics did not collapse and Central Europe was not shaken by 
our split. Czech society accepted this change with 
understanding as a fact of life. It did not succumb to a feeling 
of despondency or defeatism. It did not come to hate Slovaks, 
and without much hesitation it set about creating new relations 
within the area of the Czech state. 
  We soon began to understand that the wound caused to many of 
us by the division of Czechoslovakia was a kind of tax we are 
having to pay for our post-November freedom. What this division 
will really mean historically, and what will it bring, depends 
again above all on ourselves. 
  The aim of European unification is to create a new type of 
coexistence and cooperation of all its independent parts. We 
therefore ought to accept the fact that we are taking part in 
such unification as two sovereign states bounded together by the 
richness of Czech-Slovak mutual relations simply as a newly and 
differently based challenge to fulfill this European goal. If 
we succeed in this endeavor, it will mean that we have 
successfully passed this historic test. 
  We have prerequisites for this. The most important of them 
is the fact that immediately after its establishment the Czech 
Republic succeeded in following up on all that was good in both 
the older and fresh Czechoslovak legacy. We have clearly 
subscribed to the humanistic and democratic tradition of our 
modern history, and this we have expressed symbolically by 
adopting the Czechoslovak national holiday and by continuing 
without interruption the great work of transformation that began 
after November 1989. 
  Thanks to all this, our parliament succeeded in adopting in 
good time the new democratic Constitution and a large number of 
other laws, and thus continued the fundamental rebuilding of the 
whole of our legal system. We began to establish and put into 
practice the new constitutional system. The president was 
elected and the constitutional court established. This year 
this process will be further promoted by holding elections to 
the Senate. 
  Our government enjoys the lasting support of parliament and 
the majority of our citizens. Thanks also to the orderly manner 
in which Czechoslovakia was divided, the Czech Republic was in a 
short time fully recognized by the international community. In 
its foreign policy it soon was able to stand on its own feet 
and, in a manner appropriate to the new situation, it followed 
up in a creative way on the active foreign policy of 
post-November Czechoslovakia. 
  The most visible success of the Czech Republic is 
undoubtedly 
its success in maintaining the pace of economic transformation 
and its refusal to deviate from its plan. It thereby 
demonstrated that the course taken after the first discussions 
was the correct one. [passage omitted] 
  One can say overall that most of the basic changes carried 
out in our economic system have been carried out and therefore 
we can today regard its transformation as irreversible. 
  Esteemed friends, I am well aware of all the difficulties -- 
and frequently the pain -- which the great changes now taking 
place in all areas of our life are causing in your ordinary 
life. I am well aware of your fear of growing criminality. I 
am aware of problems many of you, especially older people, are 
having with the restructuring of social and health care. I am 
aware of the risks connected with your business activities. 
  It is precisely because I am aware of all this that I 
appreciate the fact that most of you understand the good sense 
of these changes and the patience with which you are coping with 
all the burdensome phenomena accompanying them. Again and 
again, I admire the courage with which so many of you are 
engaging in the creative work of building new relations. This 
is why I regard the speed and all the existing good results of 
our social transformation as being due to you, citizens of the 
Czech Republic, rather than to the government and the 
parliament. [passage omitted] 
  I believe the common denominator of several important tasks 
we ought to concern ourselves with now is the creation of a 
genuine -- that is a truly open -- and many-layered civic 
society. The large-scale privatization taking place in our 
society must in my view quickly find its counterpart in civic 
and public life. We ought to broaden really purposefully and 
with much greater courage than hitherto the trust in the 
individual as real creator of economic prosperity. We must also 
show greater trust in the individual as a citizen capable of 
assuming his share of joint responsibility for the affairs of 
the whole community. 
  Of course, there are tasks which only the state can and must 
discharge if it is to have any purpose at all. Perhaps there 
are more of these tasks than our government admits at present. 
At the same time, however, there are many other tasks which 
citizens themselves could and indeed should discharge to a far 
greater extent and which they could discharge better than the 
state. [passage omitted] 
  Democracy is a system based on trust in human 
responsibility, and this is something it should awaken and 
cultivate. Democracy and civic society are therefore only two 
sides of the same coin. In any case, at a time when the 
civilization of our planet is threatened by human 
irresponsibility, I do not see at the present time any other way 
of saving it than by a general awakening and the cultivation of 
man's responsibility for the affairs of this world. 
  Above all, the development of a civic society depends, of 
course, on citizens themselves, but not only on them. What can 
the state do in this respect? Out of many possible examples I 
will cite at least two which seem to me at this moment 
especially topical. 
  There has been a great deal of talk about the reform of 
public administration. I believe our state is facing here a 
typical challenge of the present time, a challenge which has a 
deeper purpose that might appear at the first sight. If the 
state has the courage to decentralize itself in a good time and 
if that decentralization is based on the good idea of bringing 
various types of decision-making to the lowest possible level 
and of giving greater scope to self-administration, both at a 
higher and at a community level, then it can make a significant 
contribution to the creation of a real civic society. 
  After all, a large number of matters now being tackled at 
individual ministries could be tackled by people far more 
flexibly and with a better knowledge of all specific 
circumstances at the level of regions and natural areas. Many 
matters now being dealt with at district level could be dealt 
with faster and more effectively by local communities. And an 
even more daring decentralization in redistribution could merely 
help ensure that such a redistribution reacts truly sensitively 
to the multifaceted requirements of life which can be hardly 
foreseen at the center. [passage omitted] 
  Another area in which civic participation in the public life 
should be significantly strengthened is that extensive area 
which is not mostly a private matter but which at the same time 
should not be confined only to the state, an area which is not 
aimed at profit making but which at the same time is extremely 
important to society. I am talking about the large area of 
nonprofit or public organizations. [passage omitted] 
  The state should not be founded on the notion that it alone 
knows best what society needs and that it alone should finance 
this area from centrally collected taxes. Central financing 
leads inevitably to central control. Here, too, we must trust 
citizens more and enable them to assume greater responsibility. 
The issue then is thoughtfully delegating to other subjects 
some of the redistributing functions currently vested with the 
state. [passage omitted] 
  Moreover, by expanding the opportunities I have been talking 
about we will help our society deepen civic solidarity, enhance 
interest in public affairs and experience in participating in 
them, and raise people's sense of responsibility for the whole 
community. We will thereby indirectly nurture a attitude to 
one's country. 
  Esteemed friends, I believe you understand what this is all 
about. After all, this is not a complicated matter. To put it 
simply, unless courageous economic reforms are accompanied by 
long-term, purposeful, and continuous care for the good 
development of all levels of civic society, our life will soon 
become one-dimensional. It will become desolate. It will 
restrict itself to a mere pursuit of profit accompanied by an 
apathetic attitude to public affairs and once again reliance on 
the state as someone who on our behalf will take care of 
everything. 
  A modern democratic state cannot be composed, to put it 
simply, of merely the state administration, political parties, 
and private enterprises. It must open to citizens a varied 
scale of opportunities to enable them to become involved not 
only privately but also publicly; to enable them to develop 
various types of civic coexistence, solidarity, and 
participation. [passage omitted] 
  Moreover, a genuine civic society is the greatest insurance 
against various kinds of social tension or political and social 
shocks. It makes it possible to tackle various problems 
immediately where they begin and ensure that they do not fester 
somewhere under society's skin and finally grow to such an 
extent that they pose a threat to the life of the society as a 
whole. 
  We hear frequently the word standard. We are building a 
standard market economy, a standard political system, and 
standard political parties. We pass standard laws, norms, and 
principles and look at standard advertisements. One has nothing 
against it if standard means that something is well tested and 
good. We must take care, however, not to profess standards as 
such, to adopt standard attitudes about oneself in order not to 
succumb subsequently to the mistake of seeing everything that is 
standard as being customarily also good. There are things which 
cannot be standard because of their very nature, and which if 
they were standardized would mean simply that they had become 
simplified and inexcusably the same. [passage omitted] 
  A talk about civic society is of course a talk about the 
character of the state. I believe the Czech nation, like other 
advanced European nations, has already grown out of the diapers 
of its modern national awakening and is now mature enough to 
know that their Czech nationality cannot be the sole or main 
purpose of its existence. It must be something different and 
somewhat more than a mere culmination of the nation's existence. 
  We cherish our nation's history, its traditions, culture, 
and good customs. We love our language, country, and the towns 
in which we live, our country's spiritual climate. We equally 
cherish other levels of our belonging -- to one's family, 
church, community, profession, or company, society, political 
party -- a community of those with whom we share a common view 
of the world. I believe most of us already understand that none 
of these groups to which we profess our belonging -- however 
well disposed toward others we might be -- cannot be elevated 
above them and changed into some kind of a determining purpose 
of the existence of the state. 
  During World War II, Europe learned how far the idea of an 
ethnically pure state can lead and it is now watching this 
happen, in a different form, with impotent horror in the former 
Yugoslavia. We learned sufficiently how far the idea of a state 
based on class ideology led during the era of communism. We see 
in the manifestations of fundamentalism which is trying hard to 
take power in some Islamic countries just where the idea of a 
strictly religious state can lead. An ideology which 
establishes a state only, and only on considerations of how some 
people differ from others and thereby on what divides them, 
always leads to a use of force. 
  The only alternative to a strictly national state as created 
in various forms in Europe over the past centuries is today a 
state founded on a civic principle, a principle which unites 
rather than divides people without suppressing any of its 
specific features. [passage omitted] 
  To build a state on a civic principle cannot of course be 
done except by building a genuine civic society. I believe this 
is the path the Czech Republic should take. It is not a path 
that will lead to any loss of national or any other identity; on 
the contrary, it will lead to its peaceful development. [passage 
omitted] 
  Europe is now endeavoring to give itself a historically new 
type of order which is called unification. It is not a matter 
of making all nations, ethnic groups, cultures, and regions 
dissolve into some kind of an amorphous pan-European sea; nor is 
it a question of creating some kind of a monstrous super-state. 
It is a question of making it possible to create a space for a 
close, equal cooperation among various individual parts of 
Europe. It is a question, therefore, of building a Europe in 
which a powerful nation can no longer oppress a less powerful 
one and in which disputes are no longer resolved by force. 
  It is a complicated process and it will undoubtedly be 
accompanied by many mistakes. It is, however, something worth 
trying. The basic principle which makes such an integration at 
all possible is once again a civic principle as a guarantee that 
national hatred will never again prevail over normal civic 
cooperation. Many different civic communities of European 
democratic states are jointly creating a great civic European 
society. I do not see for us any other or better possibility 
than to accept this spirit of a civic Europe. It is the only 
way we have of ridding us forever of a fear of others. 
  In a democracy, relations between citizens and politicians 
are always a two-way process. Politics mirrors the will and 
moods of citizens; at the same time, the conduct of politicians 
influences the conduct of citizens. The task of political 
power, which is concerned about civic society, is therefore not 
only to issue relevant laws but also to care about what is 
understood as political culture. 
  To be more specific, if politicians want to awaken in 
citizens their best talents and powers, their resolve to serve 
the whole community, and their responsibility for it, then they 
should think more about public affairs and less about how much 
to foster their own career and how to successfully put something 
over some other politician. A good political climate is one of 
the important conditions of a good social climate. After all 
the tremors caused by the shock of our newly acquired freedom, 
the spirit of good will, tolerance, decency, interest in others, 
belief in good human features, respect for life, natural 
responsibility, modesty, and kindness should return to our 
social climate. The better we succeed in achieving this, the 
better life will be for all of us. 
  Esteemed fellow citizens, on this day four years ago I said 
that our country was not flourishing. What can I say today? I 
would not dare to say that it is already flourishing, but I am 
not afraid to say that green shoots have already begun to appear 
in many places. One can see the shoots of something new, of 
something promising and hopeful. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Government of the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia profoundly regrets the resolution on the situation in 
the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was recently adopted by the 
UN General Assembly. This was stated in a letter sent to UN 
Secretary General Butrus-Ghali by Dragomir Djokic, head of the 
Yugoslav mission in the United Nations, on behalf of the 
Yugoslav Government. 
  The assertion by the authors of the resolution that 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is the victim of Serbian aggression has been 
refuted in practice with fierce fighting between the Bosnian 
Croats and Muslims. The authors of the resolution, the letter 
states, ignore the fact that it is the Bosnian Muslims who have 
been persistently obstructing the peace process in the past few 
months and refusing to accept and implement the agreements that 
the cochairmen of the conference on the former Yugoslavia 
consider realistic and just. 
  The Yugoslav Government rejects the accusations about 
concentration camps throughout the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia and stresses that such camps are run by the Bosnian 
Muslims and the Bosnian Croats. 
  The resolution also mentions the violation of human rights 
of 
ethnic Albanians, Bosnians, Hungarians, Croats, and others in 
Kosmet [Kosovo-Metohija] and Vojvodina, which is not only 
something that the resolution should not be dealing with but 
also represents an unprecedented fabrication and distortion of 
the truth, the letter states. 
  Particularly unacceptable is the fact that Security Council 
Resolution 820, which was imposed on the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia because the Bosnian Serbs rejected the Vance-Owen 
plan, is still in force, even though cochairmen David Owen and 
Thorvald Stoltenberg have abandoned the plan themselves. This 
was pointed out by Ambassador Djokic in the letter to 
Butrus-Ghali.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Finance Minister Ivan Szabo by </F>
Istvan Varga; place and date not given: "Past the Nadir After 
Three Years -- Ivan Szabo on Economic Growth and Crisis Sectors"] 
  [Text] Hungarian economic changes require greater 
sacrifices than were expected by many people in 1990. The gross 
domestic product [GDP] decreased by 15 percent in three years, 
although the decline appears to have stopped this year and it is 
possible that a solid growth will start next year. The question 
is how fast and lasting the upturn will be. A brief period of 
growth could easily be followed by another decline. In order to 
avoid this, the banking system has to be put in order, a further 
swelling of the budget deficit has to be curbed, and Hungarian 
exports have to increase. We interviewed Finance Minister Ivan 
Szabo on the chances and the effect of the factors that depend 
on us and that are independent of us. 
  [Varga] Recently you said a number of times that the 
Hungarian economy has arrived at the threshold of growth. What 
is the basis for this statement? 
  [Szabo] When we talk about the whole economy, we have to 
look at its various elements. One of these is industry, which 
started to move in a positive direction from the fourth quarter 
of 1992 and production has been increasing every month. It 
seems that, by the end of the year, industry will have produced 
4 percent more than in 1992. Agriculture is in an emphatically 
bad situation, it has many wounds. On the basis of yields and 
the sown area, it can be established that the drought that has 
lasted many years and caused specially large damage this year 
caused most losses. However, it has to be admitted that the 
changeover also has a price: The slowest structural change is 
in agriculture and it is far behind the pace of industrial 
transformation. Services that include transport is the third 
big area of the economy. There is a general boom in the service 
sector. The small and medium size enterprises that are part of 
the private sphere in this sector have reached as much as 15 to 
20 percent growth. On the other hand, road, railway, and water 
transport suffered untold losses, mainly due to the Yugoslav 
embargo. Therefore, we can conclude that the economy is drawn 
back by the low performance of agriculture and transport. 
Otherwise the GDP would already be showing an increase. 
<H5>  Special Support to Agriculture </H5>
  [Varga] How much loss does the UN embargo cause to Hungary? 
  [Szabo] According to calculations, this now reaches $1.2 
billion. However, it has to be added that $300 million arose in 
1992 and this year's figure approaches $900 million. 
  [Varga] What does the government do to improve the situation 
in agriculture, which is the main crisis sector? 
  [Szabo] The government is trying its best, but it can only 
be hoped that the many-years-long drought will end. The amount 
of agricultural support will increase by 20 percent in the 1994 
budget. I expect much from the fruition of the association 
agreement with the European Union. In this respect, it is 
positive that the GATT talks have ended, which also gives 
Hungary more room for maneuver. Unfortunately, in the area of 
transport, we cannot expect significant changes until the 
situation outside our border changes. 
<H5>  If Recession Ends.... </H5>
  [Varga] Experts also admit that a solid growth can be 
expected next year, but they immediately ask how lasting the 
growth is going to be. They mention the deficit of the state 
administration as the main hindering factor. 
  [Szabo] Undoubtedly, the level of the deficit of state 
administration causes liquidity problems in the economy. The 
reason is that the state bonds tie up the mobile capital of the 
banks. However, two factors have to be added to this. One is 
that our state administration's deficit would not be one of the 
worst in Western Europe. It is a different matter that, in 
their case, the budget deficit is in an economy that is 
operating better than ours. In addition to this the crisis that 
was caused by the collapse of the Soviet Union can be felt 
everywhere. Compared to the GDP, the deficit is twice as much 
in Sweden, and one and a half to two times as much in England 
and Belgium. I think that we managed to stop the increase of 
the budget deficit this year. It seems that we will be able to 
keep to the level of the deficit defined in this year's 
supplementary budget. I honestly hope that we will also be able 
to say the same next year. If we reach this point, then the 
many- years-long process, namely that the deficit is always 
bigger than planned, will be reversed. 
  [Varga] Do you feel that the economy can now start on a 
course of lasting growth? 
  [Szabo] I am convinced that it can. However, it has to be 
seen clearly that Hungary's economy is basically dependent on 
foreign markets and more than half of the gross national product 
is sold abroad. Therefore, Hungarian economic development 
mainly depends on the West European countries. The fact that we 
did not manage to achieve growth this year is largely a 
consequence of the decline there. The forecasts referring to 
the European Union and the European Free Trade Association 
[EFTA] indicate that economic growth will also start there in 
1994. A modest growth in Western Europe can have a decisive 
effect on Hungarian exports. A 1-percent growth abroad can 
increase Hungarian exports by as much as 25 percent. Therefore, 
to answer the question how lasting the growth will be, I can say 
that this depends very much on foreign market conditions. 
  [Varga] Bank and debtor consolidation will be implemented in 
December 1993 and next year. According to the government's 
promise, this is the last step to putting the economy back in 
order. 
  [Szabo] This is needed because all losses that have 
accumulated in the economy over the past years now appear as 
dubious or bad debts. This is where everything culminates. The 
majority of bad debts originate from the crisis of circular 
debts that has been pushed along since 1988 and 1989, and it 
amounted to 300 billion [currency not specified] already then. 
And at that time, the forint had a different value. 
  Putting this area in order will eliminate most of the ruins 
forever. On one hand, bank and debtor consolidation gives an 
opportunity for the economy to rid itself of burdens that even 
effect enterprises that operate well. This helps preserve 
workplaces that, after a while, will lead to reducing the 
solidarity fund and welfare expenditure. The other result of 
the tidying up of banks will be that the capital ratio of 
domestic banks will improve. The stability of the various 
financial institutions will increase and the gap between 
interest rate on deposits and loans will narrow. The 
improvement of the capital ratio will also increase the 
privatization chances of banks. 
  [Varga] What is needed to be able to sell the currently 
rather-shaky banks on good terms? 
  [Szabo] According to European norms, a normally operating 
capital ratio is at around 8 percent, and banks that have less 
than this find it difficult to find a buyer. The capital ratio 
of Hungarian banks is incredibly low, it is usually under 0 
percent. If we privatizaed a bank under these circumstances, I 
am afraid that it would have to be given away free and even then 
the buyer would be generous. If the state was not putting 300 
billion forints into the banking sector then the buyers would 
have to do this. It is obvious that, if we do not consolidate 
the banks, then we will lose the purchase price. However, 
raising the capital ratio to 4 percent or even higher will make 
it possible for us to sell the banks on better conditions. At 
the same time, it is much easier to increase this figure from 4 
or 6 percent to above 8 percent. In this case, it will be worth 
buying a bank, especially if the investor group can acquire a 
significant economic role through this. I believe that the 
technical and finance-technical conditions will be adequate by 
the middle of next year for bank privatization to begin. 
  [Varga] The investors of which countries show most interest? 
  [Szabo] Mainly European interest is big which we can also 
see from the fact that many foreign banks, not having found any 
healthy Hungarian banks, have established subsidiaries in 
Hungary. However, I must add that interest is shown literally 
from all over the world, because even a Malay bank was recently 
established in Budapest. Interestingly, the London-based 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development [EBRD] shows a 
remarkably great interest in bank privatization and it would 
like to become part owner of several Hungarian financial 
institutions. 
<H5>  The Stages of Integration </H5>
  [Varga] Whether we look at the import of capital or the 
export of goods, contacts with Western Europe is the key issue 
of the Hungarian economy's development. In your view, when will 
Hungary be admitted to the European Union [EU]? 
  [Szabo] In my view, EU membership has many conditions. One 
is legal harmonization, and the institutional structure also has 
to be set up. In my view, we are not behind in these. The 
transitional period while we are associate members will be 
enough for us to prepare for the membership. Considering all 
this, I expect that full membership will be possible to achieve 
sometime between 1997 and 2000. By this time, our institutional 
and economic development can reach the point at which 
unification will not be much of a problem either for Europe or 
for Hungary. 
  [Varga] Will the political or the economic conditions of 
membership be more difficult to fulfill? 
  [Szabo] Economic conditions certainly play a determining 
role. Politically it is also important for Europe that the 
countries of this region are economically solid, otherwise we 
can also shake their stability. This would have far-reaching 
negative political consequences. It is a completely different 
matter that economic integration has to be concomitant with some 
kind of integration in security policy. However, I believe it 
is Western Europe's fundamental interest that these countries 
that are economically linked to it do not belong somewhere else 
politically. The one supposes the other. 
  [Varga] How do you assess the achievements so far? 
  [Szabo] I believe that Hungary has been taking the hurdles 
of transition very well. The challenges in our region are huge. 
I think that if Hungary wants to create serious chances for 
itself, then 1994 will be a good occasion for this. We have to 
preserve the Hungarian economy from disarray, hyper-inflation, 
or chaos. If Hungary remains to be an island of peace, both in 
political and economic terms, then it can make a very big step 
forward. It can prove to the world that Hungary does not follow 
fashions and avoids right- or left-wing extremism and this meets 
the European standards.

<F P=106> [New Year's address by President Lech Walesa; place and date </F>
not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Ladies and gentlemen: 1993 is receding into the 
past and becoming a part of history. It is not possible now to 
know how it will be recorded or how the nation will remembered 
it. To a large extent, it will depend on its background in 
light of subsequent years. For now, we still lack the necessary 
distance for a thorough examination and a fair assessment. 
  The passing year was rich in important events. It was a time 
of disputes and emotions, of thorough political reshuffles. The 
September elections changed the political configuration of the 
parliament. They handed over the helm of government to the left 
wing. They closed the first chapter in the history of the Third 
Republic, the chapter whose substance and form had been 
fashioned by political forces originating from Solidarity. The 
elections brought them the bitterness of defeat. Their actions 
and efforts did not get the voters' approval. I am convinced 
that time will correct this opinion and do them justice. 
  Once the memory of things which are transitory in the lives 
of peoples fades, the true dimension of the achievements will 
become clearer--the undeniable achievements that have changed 
the face of Poland. 
  The passing year was a year of disappointments but also of 
hopes. Our hopes came from a variety of sources. For some 
people these were the economic results heralding the beginning 
of growth, the overcoming of the economic collapse. For other 
people these were the political changes that have been carried 
out. These sources need not be mutually exclusive. 
  I wish all of us to be able to receive hope from both of 
them 
in the coming year. May the new team not disappoint those for 
whom it was their hope. May it dispel the fears of those for 
whom it was a denial of hope. May it be bold but also prudent. 
While improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the state, 
may it not dampen its citizens' enterprise and initiative, and, 
while improving things that need improvement, not destroy the 
things that have started to bear fruit. 
  The year that has passed was also a year of promises. That 
is a natural thing in an election year. Now comes the time of 
their verification. We have to change from electoral poetry to 
prose of governance. The next few months will show whether the 
force of words is backed by a real force of ideas and 
implementation. 
  So may the year of promises not be followed by a year of 
disappointment. I wish the people wisdom of their rulers. I 
wish the country peace and success. I wish the state 
prosperity. May the year we are going to greet in a few hours' 
time be happy and more prosperous.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] From the cabinet of the president of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency we have just received President 
Izetbegovic's letter to President of Croatia Franjo Tudjman. It 
reads as follows: 
  Esteemed Mr. President: I reply to your letter of 23 
December 1993. I agree that the humanitarian situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is very grave and this, it seems, is the only 
thing we fully agree upon at the moment. We evidently perceive 
some facts in relation to this situation in totally different 
ways. First, your convoy for Nova Bila has reached its 
destination. Our convoy has not reached Maglaj. This convoy is 
waiting in hope in Zenica. You have been misinformed about this 
matter. 
  It is true that the Nova Bila convoy was being considerably 
delayed along its way but you are certainly familiar with the 
reason behind this -- the military equipment hidden in it. This 
is why I fail to understand your criticism of what you brand as 
unjustifiable delays. It turned out, regrettably, that these 
delays were entirely justified. On its way back the convoy 
encountered problems because it was caught in crossfire near 
Gornji Vakuf, where for months battles have been raging on a 
daily basis. We regret the casualties but it was not us who 
started this war in general or the one around Gornji Vakuf in 
particular. 
  The Bosnia-Herzegovina army legally defends this town from 
the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] paramilitary formations and 
their attempts to take the town. They are responsible for the 
destruction of this town and the deaths of hundreds of its 
citizens. Every single word in the message, sent allegedly by 
Djemo Merdan, deputy commander of the 3d Corps, is fabricated. 
Our army does not kill women and children. What evidence do 
you have to support such crude slander against the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army? I believe that it is entirely 
inappropriate to include an unconfirmed and, I believe 
fabricated statement in our correspondence. 
  As far as the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army is concerned, I want 
to 
be perfectly clear. The presence of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 
in every part of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina is legal 
and legitimate to the same extent the presence of other military 
formations that do not recognize the supreme command of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency is unlawful and unacceptable. The 
Bosnia-Herzegovina army cannot be an aggressor in its own 
country. Only armies sent in from other centers withut 
permission from the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency can be 
aggressors. 
  Hence, the allegations made in your letter regarding the 
Nova 
Bila humanitarian convoy have no grounds. Nor do the 
allegations about the Bosnia-Herzegovina army's conduct. 
  The following facts are, however, indisputable. First, the 
field hospital donated by the South African Union to the 
population of eastern Mostar has been waiting for as long as six 
months in Ploce. It was stopped by Croatian authorities and is 
now being slowly cannibalized. Who is irritated by a field 
hospital? What is the justification for this inhumane act? 
  Second, in Medjugorje your forces confiscated and blocked 
two 
months ago two of our helicopters which had been sent in 
agreement with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] and given its 
assistance to collect the wounded although Medjugorje is on the 
territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Third, your police, in the course of the last campaign 
against the citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina in Croatia, without 
any basis or explanation, confiscated 2,760 vehicles that were 
the property of our citizens. This is a figure that can be 
substantiated by documents in our embassy in Zagreb. The true 
number of vehicles that were taken could only be larger. 
  We stated that the Croat authorities in Herzegovina founded 
concentration camps and imprisoned in them tens of thousands of 
innocent civilians. You have persistently rejected this 
assertion as slanderous. A few days ago your minister of 
foreign affairs, in a letter to the UN Security Council, boasted 
that the Croatian authorities, and I quote, freed 5,600 Muslim 
prisoners. How can prisoners be freed from camps that do not 
exist? 
  I am intentionally not setting out here the historical 
details of the conflict in Herzegovina that has been accompanied 
by the brutal ethnic cleansing of the Muslim population in 
Mostar, Stolac, Capljina, Livno, and other places, the 
culmination of which was the barbaric destruction of the Old 
Bridge [in Mostar]. Nor am I setting out here worrying reports 
of the presence of significant elements of the Croatian armed 
forces on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, something which 
shows the open interference of Croatia in the internal affairs 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina, because this is contained in our letter 
to the Security Council. 
  Despite everything that has been said, and many negative 
facts, I wish to convey equally seriously to you our sincere 
interest in improving the relations between our two countries, 
and in developing all forms of cooperation. For this to be 
achieved, however, a true change in your policy toward 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is needed. 
  Furthermore -- as I have stressed to you many times -- you 
cannot expect us to improve relations by negotiating with people 
who have been branded as executioners [djelati] of the Muslim 
people. With my respects. 
  This is the content of the letter that Alija Izetbegovic, 
president of the presidency, sent to Franjo Tudjman.

<F P=106> ["Text of New Year's Message Addressed by Romania's </F>
President, Mr. Ion Iliescu, to the Nation Over the Radio and 
Television," in Bucharest on 31 December 1993] 
  [Text] Dear compatriots: We are crossing the threshold of 
a new year. It is our tradition, as well as that of other 
peoples, to be closer to each other at the end of one year and 
the beginning of another and to think with greater hope and 
confidence of the new year that is approaching. 
  May it be a better year and may our hopes come true. With 
these thoughts and feelings, I am addressing you with heartfelt 
wishes for health, happiness, peace, understanding, and for many 
happy returns. 
  The year we are concluding has been neither simple nor easy. 
Maybe it has not brought the much-desired satisfactions to 
people's homes and hearts, it has stored up -- as we, in fact, 
expected -- too many difficulties. Surely, however, if we judge 
correctly and objectively, the year 1993 was a purposeful year 
that placed our hopes on a more stable foundation. This year of 
continuity in our political and social balance and stability 
also marked the beginning of our economic consolidation, a first 
and decisive step toward what we have to perform from now on. 
  At the foreign level, the year 1993 marked Romania's 
recognition as a factor of stability in this part of the world 
that is still beset by anxiety, conflicts, and explosive 
situations with serious and incalculable consequences. This 
year marked the consecration of our integration into European 
structures and our association, on the basis of partnership, 
with international bodies and organizations. The merit of being 
in a completely different international position today and of 
benefiting from relations, which we have to honor with 
dedication and seriousness, belongs to all reasonable political 
and social forces in our country. 
  Dear compatriots, I believe that all of us have reason to 
hope that the year to come will more evidently display the 
fruits of Romania's change for the better. First, I am 
truthfully thinking of those who have had and continue to have 
difficulties, families with numerous children or those who are 
without jobs -- young people, pensioners, and other segments, 
who, day in day out, have to make ends meet with their modest 
incomes. I want to grant them a tiny support and encouragement: 
They will be neither eschewed, nor forgotten. It is the duty 
of all of those invested with responsibilities in our society to 
pay attention -- along with economic recovery -- to measures for 
social protection in the year to come. 
  I am addressing all those who, through great efforts, honest 
work, and practical initiatives -- the entrepreneurs and 
managers of economic units -- have reaped success. I want to 
congratulate them and to wish them new successes in the year to 
come. Their results are of great importance in the work of 
relaunching our economy. Their experience has to be encouraged 
and given general application. Not through profiteering and 
fiscal evasion will we build a modern economy, but through 
productive initiative and intensive, intelligent, and honest 
work. 
  Dear compatriots, we are going through a period that is 
still 
difficult. It is a trying time for our nation but we must never 
forget that, during difficult and decisive times, the Romanian 
nation reaped success through unity, cohesion, courage, and 
intelligence, thus, each time, recovering through commendable 
proof of balance and stability. Instigation to hatred and 
disorder and disunity and intolerance have not been and are not 
favorable, but, on the contrary, they have played and can play 
into the hands of interests that are dangerous to our national 
destiny. 
  Therefore, I want to appeal to the political and social 
forces, and to all our citizens to rally their efforts, 
capabilities, and energy, which our people do not lack, in order 
to build a modern and prosperous society. Let us abandon feuds 
and intolerance, as well as sterile confrontations and disputes. 
Let us seek, together, through dialogue, the points of 
understandings and eliminate those that disunite us. 
  On the eve of the New Year, I would like to extend a warm 
message to our brethren across the Prut River -- to Ilie Ilascu 
and his friends, and to all Romanians everywhere. I want to 
express the hope that the year 1994 will guarantee for all of us 
a better life, that it will be a year of peace and understanding 
and of unity on the platform of national interests. 
  In conclusion of his message, President Ion Iliescu wishes 
everyone a happy New Year and many happy returns.

  [Text] Zagreb, Jan 3 (AFP) -- Yasushi Akashi, the United 
Nations' new special representative in ex-Yugoslavia, said upon 
his arrival here Monday that Japan must contribute peacekeeping 
troops toward the conflict in the region. "Japan, which is now 
a major power, has to cooperate with European countries, with 
the United States, Canada and the other governments which are 
already deeply involved in restoring peace here in 
ex-Yugoslavia," Akashi said during a press conference. 
  "If Europeans are in Asia, why shouldn't Asians be in 
Europe," he said refering to UN peacekeeping troops deployed in 
Cambodia. 
  Akashi, 62, in his new assignment becomes the special UN 
representative in the former Yugoslavia and head of the UN 
Protection Force deployed in the region. He replaces Thorvald 
Stoltenberg who will retain his position as co-chairman of the 
Geneva peace talks on the Bosnian conflict. Akashi previously 
headed the UN force deployed in Cambodia. 
  Akashi later announced that a team of Japanese Government 
experts would soon arrive in former Yugoslavia to study how 
Tokyo could "extend its cooperation in order to help restore 
peace" to the region. He also said he was planning to 
reorganize some sections of UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection 
Forces], introducing elements which he had personally selected. 
He said he saw his role as helping to reestablish confidence 
between the three warring factions.

<F P=106> [Ivan G. Ivanov commentary: "Opposite Poles Attract One </F>
Another"] 
  [Text] At one time there was a popular joke to the effect 
that "every rumor is a reality!" It has turned out that this 
witticism still has topical significance. 
  The persistent rumor of a meeting between the top leaders of 
the SDS [Union of Democratic Forces] and BSP [Bulgarian 
Socialist Party] is on the way to being confirmed. Filip 
Dimitrov, SDS National Coordinating Council leader, has declared 
that he has met with [BSP leader] Zhan Videnov. 
  The leaders of the two main political forces indeed have 
plenty to talk about. The subjects for discussion go far beyond 
seeking a way out from the vexatious situation in which the SDS 
and BSP have found themselves and possibly forming a coalition 
to fight local elections. 
  Both the SDS and the BSP have their reservations regarding 
Dr. Zhelev, and they did not permit him to extend his powers. 
  The same applies to any early National Assembly elections. A 
well-calculated amendment to the Electoral Law would enable the 
SDS's "disloyal ally," the DPS [Movement for Rights and 
Freedoms], to be thrown overboard and ensure the tranquil 
existence of a two-party parliament in the future. 
  Another question is that neither the SDS nor the BSP really 
want elections before the end of parliament's allotted term. 
This is also a subject for discussion. 
  Regarding the naive voters (if there are any left) for whom 
the idea of such a meeting appears ridiculous, let them recall 
one of the laws of physics, which states that opposite poles 
attract one another.

<F P=106> [Article by Dimitur Vasilev: "Movement for Rights and </F>
Freedoms Is Preparing To Form an Association of Municipalities 
To Act as a State Within the State"] 
  [Text] At the end of November the DPS [Movement for Rights 
and Freedoms] held its second national conference, which adopted 
the DPS program and decisions on its future activities. In 
fulfillment of the latter, in December the DPS initiated 
meetings in certain municipalities to discuss and adopt a 
"Charter for an Association of Municipalities." DPS municipal 
councillors had taken the trouble to draft a document called a 
charter for establishing a new administrative-state organization 
not prescribed under national legislation. At this point it 
must be stated that the association dreamt up by the DPS is 
illegitimate. The National Assembly is the only body with the 
powers to constitute and create new state bodies not covered by 
the Constitution and the law of the land. 
  The aims and tasks of the association as recorded in its 
charter emphasize its supramunicipal character. It is to be an 
body of government that can impose a dictate over its member 
municipalities in deciding specific issues, albeit with the 
"consent" of the mayor of the municipality in question. It is 
no accident that the charter includes this phrase -- with the 
consent of the mayor, because the purpose of this is to make it 
easier for the association to impose its dictate in practice, 
for the mayors exercise the power of the state, not only 
representing the municipalities, but also governing them. On 
the other hand, not every mayor in the territory covered by the 
association can be a DPS member. For this reason, the 
association's leadership will not be able to wield its dictate 
in every municipality. Furthermore, all the DPS mayors are 
functionaries of the local DPS leaderships and are subject to 
their will. They are obliged to fulfill the DPS program. 
Evidently, the association's leadership will consist solely of 
DPS representatives. In the last elections, 27 municipal mayors, 
653 village mayors, and 24 National Assembly deputies were 
elected from the DPS list. According to the decisions of the DPS 
national conference, they are all DPS functionaries and must 
obey its orders. 
  Under the charter, the association's member municipalities 
can preserve their economic, political, and juridical 
independence, but how will they retain it when, according to the 
same charter, the association may set them tasks, supervise 
them, adopt decisions to be carried out by the municipalities, 
and call them to account. Although they have joined the 
association "voluntarily," the municipalities are placed under 
its leadership. Accordingly, the association becomes an body of 
the DPS and is anticonstitutional in nature. It will comprise 
not one, but several associations, established on 
administrative-territorial and ethnic principles. Accordingly, 
the associations form an intermediate link in the state 
structure. They are tending to replace the regional and 
district municipal councils as specified in the Local 
Self-Government Act that have not been created so far and are 
unlikely to appear in the future. The DPS has decided to fill 
this gap by forming these associations. They are being created 
in regions with a Turkish- speaking population and are 
differentiated on an ethnic basis. The Constitution does not 
permit such autonomous territorial formations (under Article 2, 
Paragraph 1). 
  According to the charter, the leadership of the association 
consists of one representative for each municipality -- its 
mayor, who has only one vote in the adoption of decisions, which 
are passed by an absolute majority, that is, by half the number 
of members present plus one. The charter does not state the 
number of members in the association's collective leadership, 
its minimum or maximum membership, or where its headquarters 
will be located, nor does it in any way resolve the not 
unimportant issue of how the association will be financed. 
  The charter, despite its legal imperfections, is of great 
political importance because of the ethnic aims that it pursues. 
For this reason, prominence must be given to the ethnic goals 
that the DPS aims to achieve through the association. The DPS 
is trying to use it as a form of intermunicipal unification so 
as to provide qualified assistance to the DPS mayors in their 
administrative work. Accordingly, it may help them to stick more 
closely together, exercise more effective control over them, and 
help to resolve more efficiently the problems addressed in the 
DPS program. 
  The DPS wants to create an independent administrative and 
territorial unit that is protected from external influence. 
Here one can perceive the idea that Ahmed Dogan put forward at 
the DPS national conference, namely that no one should be able 
to exercise his dictate in the territory covered by the 
association -- not parliament, the president, the government, or 
anyone else. In this way, the DPS provides itself with a 
terrain for acting and holding sway, undisturbed by anyone, over 
the territory of the sovereign Bulgarian state, and for 
manipulating and deciding everything that arises from its 
program. This is already a basis for ethnic differentiation and 
for developing political, cultural, and economic autonomy. 
Thus, the association becomes "a state within the state," in 
complete contravention of the Constitution and the laws. By 
creating the association on this basis, the DPS can direct it 
and link it more closely with our southern neighbor, which in 
recent years has been displaying and following a purposeful and 
well- planned policy in many ways in the regions of Bulgaria 
with a Turkish-speaking population. This already represents a 
threat to the national security and sovereignty of the state of 
Bulgaria.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Unnecessary and Stupid"] </F>
  [Text] The interior minister's order to expel Zhirinovskiy 
is unnecessary and stupid and leaves open the question of who 
were the real people behind it. It also indicates a loss of 
nerve. 
  It is unnecessary because Zhirinovskiy was leaving anyway 
within the 24-hour deadline. So why did they not expel him when 
he arrived on Sunday? 
  It is stupid because, as was proved way back in the days of 
totalitarianism, it is in principle foolish to react to words 
with persecution. 
  It is clear that Zhirinovskiy went too far with his call for 
the replacement of the Bulgarian president. It is also clear 
that the press reacted sharply. However, no newspaper (except 
one privatized trade union paper) and no institution demanded 
the expulsion of this party leader, who won the largest number 
of votes in the Russian elections. 
  In contrast to the interior minister, the press reacted 
neither to the first tipoff nor to anyone's suggestion. 
  If it is necessary to expel everyone who permits himself to 
make insulting statements about the president, then Minister 
Mikhaylov should expel (to where?) Edvin Sugarev and all those 
who burned portraits and books of Zhelev during Sugarev's hunger 
strike. 
  Furthermore, why was [U.S. Ambassador] Montgomery not 
declared a persona non grata? In the final analysis, the 
Russian declared his dislike of a single figure, whereas the 
American criticized the Bulgarian Constitution. 
  One should either combat Zhirinovskiy's statement by the 
force of argument or swallow what he said, as the president did 
in the case of Montgomery. Surely both cases constitute 
interference in the country's internal affairs? 
  When nervous reactions of condemnation invade politics, we 
are no longer talking of politics, but of a wrestling mat, which 
is very sad when one remembers that Bulgaria is no longer a 
world force in wrestling.

  [Text] Sofia, Jan 3 (AFP) -- The Bulgarian electricity 
company launched an invitation for tenders to modernise four 440 
megawatt nuclear units at the Kozloduy power station on Monday. 
The programme is to be financed by the nuclear safety fund of 
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and 
the tenders are to be opened on March 4 in the presence of 
bidders. 
  The first stage of improvements to make safe the four 
obsolete units of Soviet design was completed last week when the 
the oldest unit, which had been in service since 1974, was put 
back into operation. This unit had been closed in September 
1991 on the recommendation of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency. 
  Apart from the four units of 440 megawatts, the plant 
comprises two more modern units, each of 1,000 megawatts. The 
power station provides between 30 percent and 40 percent of 
energy used in Bulgaria.

  [Text] The Democratic Party-National Salvation Front 
[PD-FSN] has faxed us the text of an open letter addressed by 
that party to President Ion Iliescu. Among other things, the 
letter says, quote, we express our sorrow, disillusion, and 
great concern caused by the fact that, over the short period of 
time that elapsed since your talks with the representatives of 
the PD-FSN, a dangerous record was achieved in the violation of 
the rules any democratic regime ought to follow through the 
elimination of some of the essential offices in parliament as 
well as by the intensification of the unspeakable attacks 
against the opposition, in a new campaign launched by the 
representatives of the current state power, beginning with the 
head of the executive and ending with the leaders of the 
extremist parties belonging to the ruling majority. 
  We are certain that you are well aware of all these facts, 
but we would still like to remind you of an extremely grave act 
that totally despises parliamentary norms, namely the way in 
which the draft bill empowering the government to rule by 
ordinances was discussed and passed in parliament. That 
regrettable moment is an embarrassing world premiere in this 
domain: A normative act was passed while parliament lacked the 
constitutionally established quorum. Unfortunately, that is not 
a solitary case, as a large number of representatives of the 
current state power, both in the government and in parliament, 
are systematically trying to put the opposition in a situation 
that is inconceivable in truly law-governed states, obviously 
intending to make it capitulate unconditionally under the 
pressure of abuse and discriminating and discretionary acts that 
also include menaces with penal sanctions, unquote. 
  After emphasizing the need for the accomplishment of a 
national pact, the letter outlines the key ideas and principles 
of the pact that the PD-FSN has repeatedly proposed. It then 
defines the concepts of a national pact, national interest, the 
structure of the pact, the economic pact, the social pact, and 
the political pact.

<F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "The Prague Probe"] </F>
  [Text] It has now been revealed that Gyula Horn [chairman 
of the Hungarian Socialist Party, MSZP] is looking into the 
MSZP's strategy on neighborhood policy in terms of conciliation, 
the essence of which is that to restore confidence, the 
inviolability of borders and the necessity to respect national 
minority rights should both be included in future basic 
agreements. In fact, Horn is testing more than this when he 
tells a Prague newspaper that if the MSZP is given the 
opportunity to implement its foreign policy program, then it 
will strive to have basic agreements signed with these contents 
as soon as possible. 
  At the moment, there is no point to guessing whether the 
MSZP 
will get this opportunity. However, according to our 
information, it is almost certain that the MSZP's strategy is 
obvious for the enlightened section of the Hungarian party 
spectrum. Therefore it is likely that if a coalition with this 
kind of enlightened majority comes to power next year, their 
foreign policy will be dominated by a neighborhood strategy 
similar to that of the MSZP's. Therefore, the results of the 
Prague investigation could even assume national importance. 
  It appears to be particularly ingenious that Horn detailed 
the concept, which he published in Hungary about three weeks ago 
(and which received virtually no response here), in a Prague 
newspaper. Although the Czech Republic is not one of our 
neighbors, as a result of 70 years of shared history it is quite 
attuned to Hungarian sensitivity to Slovak foreign policy, while 
this "message from Budapest" may appear more credible if it 
comes to Bratislava through a Prague detour rather than in 
"direct transmission." 
  It will be interesting to find out how [Slovak Prime 
Minister] Meciar (or Romanian President Iliescu, or perhaps 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic) reacts to this offer of 
Horn's, which speaks about mutual offers rather than bargaining. 
He did not say "if you give me the border issue, then I will 
give you the national minority rights" -- it was something 
completely different. 
  This something different is the lesson of European history 
-- 
also being intended for domestic use. It shows that the 
problems of national minorities cannot be solved through 
reattaching territories. It also shows that only guaranteeing 
the borders, rather than changing them, can bring peace, however 
badly and unjustly they were established in the first place and, 
for this reason, the borders must to be made permeable and open. 
It shows that the members of a national minority must be free 
to meet their relatives over the border whenever they want and, 
on their return, books and newspapers in their language must not 
be confiscated by customs officers. It shows that these 
minorities must be allowed schools and choirs in their home 
country, and, living in one unit, they should be able to elect 
their leaders, have the same freedom as other citizens to start 
businesses, and, something that is not a reality but only a wish 
even in Western Europe: Owing to their predetermined 
disadvantage, they should enjoy a few more rights on certain 
issues than the others (positive discrimination). 
  Bosnia and the disease tormenting Yugoslavia are examples of 
the opposite. Does anyone yearn for these? Before anyone tries 
to use the trump card of the "sold minorities" in the election 
campaign, he should consider this. [sentence as published] If 
he can.

<F P=106> [Tibor Kis editorial: "Gift"] </F>
  [Text] By denying Hungary's national minorities the right 
to set independent election lists, parliament gave an unexpected 
Christmas surprise to [Cluj Mayor] Funar, [Slovak Prime 
Minister] Meciar, and the anti-Hungarian forces of the 
neighboring countries. As long as this decision is in force, 
parliament will not have a moral right to speak up against the 
violations of national minority rights in the neighborhood, 
because it has also joined the lines of those who violate these 
rights. After this, what can be said to the accusations that 
Hungarian legislation does not practice what it preaches? While 
in all Europe, it is probably this parliament that speaks most 
about national minority rights, it has not really done anything 
more to solve this tense problem of the region than the 
parliaments and governments it so often criticizes. 
  Naturally, there is an explanation to the ominous decision 
-- 
discarding the "corporative element of representation" -- 
however, this does not at all appears to be convincing when we 
consider what is at stake. The decision certainly goes against 
the national minorities; mainly because the parliamentary 
parties were obviously unable even to bear the thought of the 
very hypothetical possibility that the representatives of 
national minorities might decide the voting on a certain 
political issue. Narrow party political considerations decided 
a matter that should not have anything to do with party 
politics. If there is an all-national problem then it is the 
national minority issue; therefore, it is simply astounding how 
little the deputies were able to realize that progress cannot be 
made through superficial rhetoric, empty speech, and especially 
not through indiscriminately denouncing the neighboring national 
minority policies. Instead, it can mainly be done through 
example. Among other things, through Hungary generously and 
without hesitation granting all rights to its national 
minorities that can be given in Europe at the moment, and which 
it itself expects from others. This generosity would be simple 
in our case, because we have fewer citizens belonging to 
national minorities than the neighboring countries have. If we 
cannot find acceptable solutions even in these circumstances, 
then what right do we have to expect the neighboring countries 
to deal with the national minority issues on their merit? 
  Of course, in the given case, international assessments are 
not the major problem. After all, we should settle our national 
minority problems for our own good rather than to give an 
example to others. These rights would be due to the national 
minorities in Hungary even if all Hungarians living beyond the 
border were deprived of them. The simple reason is that these 
people are Hungarian citizens, the constitutional provisions 
apply to them the same way as to others. And Hungary, after 
all, is a democratic constitutional state. 
  This fact of being a constitutional state appears to have 
been violated through parliament's antiminority decision. This 
in itself is enough shame. It would be even bigger shame if we 
cannot find a remedy to this wounding of Hungary's national 
minorities before the next elections.

  [Text] The Hungarian Way Circles movement considers 
rapprochement with the coalition parties possible, Chairman 
Istvan Csurka has said, adding that relations between the 
movement and the government parties naturally depend also on the 
willingness of the Hungarian Democratic Forum and the operation 
of the Boross government. Krisztina Hadas reports: 
  [Hadas] The statement of the Hungarian Way Circles presidium 
urges unity of national forces. According to movement leader 
Istvan Csurka, today countless parties characterize themselves 
as national but this self-declaration is no more than an empty 
phrase. The Hungarian Way Circles movement interprets such 
unity as meaning unity with parties of the present government 
coalition. 
  [Begin Csurka recording] This appeal, in fact, concerns the 
coalition parties and the smaller and bigger political 
gatherings and movements which are already members of the 
Hungarian Way. Now we wish to see more pronounced politics from 
them. After all, the force in government is the most important, 
regardless of how much of its popularity has been lost during 
the time of governing. [end recording] 
  [Hadas] At his news conference Csurka said that the four 
month activity of the government lead by Peter Boross could be 
extremely important for the country's future. The leader of the 
Hungarian Way Circles hopes that the forthcoming national 
conference of the Hungarian Democratic Forum will bring a 
favorable political turn for them. He did not speculate but 
said that, come what may, the Hungarian Way Circles and the 
Hungarian Justice and Life Party can only influence the 
government by declarations of principles.

<F P=106> [Correspondent's report: "The Army Will Not Have Money for </F>
Development in 1994"] 
  [Text] Compared to previous years, it will only be 
possible to maintain the Hungarian Army's ability to function 
through much greater sacrifices, Defense Ministry Spokesman 
Colonel Lajos Erdelyi told NEPSZABADSAG. 
  The Army's planned 66.5 billion-forint 1994 budget is only 
enough to maintain the current level but not to carry out 
serious development. Some 90 percent of this amount will be 
spent on daily operational expenses, Colonel Gyorgy Paszto, 
leader of the Defense Ministry's Defense Management Main 
Department, said after President Arpad Goncz signed the Defense 
Law on 23 December and, at the same time, the government had 
accepted the regulation on its implementation. 
  In connection with this, Lajos Erdely pointed out that in 
the 
1994 budget it is envisaged that the Army would acquire 8 
billion forints in income from the sale of stocks, army 
barracks, and similar buildings. It will be very difficult to 
achieve this, Erdelyi said. Although in 1994, in real terms, the 
Army will dipose of a sum which is more than 2-billion forints 
more than in 1993, financial problems are anticipated because of 
inflation and the tasks that will be new in 1994. Erdelyi found 
it especially worrying that the amount that can be spent on 
material and technical development has decreased to a minimum 
level. For 10 years, the Army has been unable to ensure the 
supposedly ideal 60 percent to 40 percent maintenance and 
development ratio. In 1994, less than 5 percent of the 66.5 
billion forints will be left for development; the change of the 
Army uniforms is also included in this. The financial problems 
are made worse by the running costs of the 28 Russian MiG-29 
aircraft that were included in the system at the end of the 
year, the planned launching of air force officer training in 
Szolnok, and the previous commitment to set up a Hungarian UN 
training base, Erdelyi said. 
  In 1994, U.S. military industrial enterprises will deliver 
113 complete electronic Identify Friend or Foe (IFF) systems to 
the Hungarian air-force. As is known, Parliament earmarked 1.1 
billion forints from the budget for this purpose in 1993. 
According to the plans, the specialists of the U.S. air-force 
will fit the equipment on 28 MiG-29, nine MiG-23, 65 MiG-21, and 
11 Su-22 aircraft. The prototypes on the various types of 
aircraft have already been set up and tried out. In addition to 
this, the suppliers will also fit four Russian-type land-based 
location systems with "questioning equipment." Putting these in 
position will probably begin mid-1994. 
  According to the NAPI VILAGGAZDASAG, a deal that is part of 
a 
U.S. Government program will amount to some $12.7 billion.

  [Text] Border Guards have reinforced the protection of the 
Hungarian-Serbian border. They fear that due to the 
introduction of a travel tax in rump Yugoslavia that is to come 
into force soon, many people will try to come across to Hungary 
illegally. Border Guard Spikesman Attila Krisan said that as a 
result of the new decree, which is valid as of midnight, the 
number of Yugoslavs entering was down to a minimum at the Tompa, 
Roeszke, and Hercegszanto border crossing points.

<F P=106> [Correspondent's report: "The Fate of the Paks Nuclear </F>
Power Station Is Uncertain"] 
  [Text] If we do not find a safe solution to store the 
expended fuel within 18 months then the further operation of the 
Paks Nuclear Power Station Inc. may become doubtful. Should 
this happen, half of Hungary's energy production would be lost, 
Laszlo Kemenes, leader of the company's information service, 
said. 
  In the past, the expended fuel was transported to the Soviet 
Union. In the summer of 1992, the Russian parliament accepted 
an environmental protection law that bans the import of 
dangerous waste. In spite of this, in February 1993, Russia 
accepted expended fuel filling a railway carriage. However, it 
is not at all certain that it will again do this, although it 
has not indicated, either, that it will refuse to process waste 
from Paks in the future. The Ukrainian side has already 
indicated that it would let the deliveries pass through. 
Considering the favorable atmosphere of talks with the 
Russians, it cannot be excluded that future deliveries will be 
possible. As Hungary cannot expose itself to the decisions of 
other countries, a solution will definitely have to be found 
within a short time. 
  For five years, the used-up fuel elements has been stored in 
a resting basin at the Paks Nuclear Power Station, then they 
were transported in special containers. At the moment, the free 
storage capacity at Paks is enough for 18 months, therefore, if 
no solution is found in the coming 18 months then, failing all 
else, the nuclear power station might be halted. 
  Being aware of this situation, to safely solve the further 
placement of waste, the company had internationally announced 
bids for building a transitional storage, and this was won by 
the French-British GEC-ALSTHOM. This company, which has built 
several of this type of storage, will have to complete the 
reception building and the storage area in 18 months. Although 
temporarily, the Paks Nuclear power station would gain time 
through this 3 to 3.5 billion forints investment.

  [Text] The forint will be devalued by 1 percent as of 3 
January. The decision was made by the Hungarian National Bank 
[MNB] within its scope of authority. The MNB gave the 
strengthening of the U.S. dollar on international foreign 
exchange markets as the reason for the decision. A communique 
points out that the measure is in line with the MNB's official 
exchange rate policy.

<F P=106> [Report on a telephone interview with Bosnia-Herzegovina </F>
Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic in Sarajevo by an unidentified 
correspondent on 2 January; Silajdzic speaks in English fading 
into German translation -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer Wolfgang Labuhn] Yesterday we asked Haris 
Silajdzic, prime minister of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
since last October, about the prospects for his country in 1994. 
Via a satellite telephone link to his official residence in the 
Bosnian capital, we asked him first of all how the people of 
Sarajevo experienced the New Year. 
  [Silajdzic] Here in Sarajevo it was the same as it has been 
over the last year. Five people died and 35 were injured on New 
Year's Eve. [passage indistinct] First, we have to come to a 
negotiated settlement, something that is unlikely because of the 
Serb position. The second possibility is that the international 
community should finally do its duty and intervene to end the 
aggression and the genocide directed against Bosnia- 
Herzegovina. The third possibility also involves the 
intervention of the international community, but for the victim, 
whose state and people are a member of the United Nations. In 
imposing an embargo against us, the international community has 
intervened for the first time in favor of the aggressor. Our 
hands are now tied and we have been suffering this aggression 
for two years now. There is no doubt that genocide is being 
committed in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the international community 
will not let us defend ourselves. We have taken part in 
negotiations, we have tried our best. Because the international 
community is not prepared to use force, the Serb negotiators are 
practically ignoring it. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Silajdzic, you are demanding that the 
international community intervene. What should be the aim of 
foreign intervention -- merely a military victory over the 
Serbs, or the complete reestablishment of the former territory 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina under the control of the Bosnian 
Government? 
  [Silajdzic] The aim is clearly defined in the UN Charter as 
well as in the resolutions of the UN Security Council, the CSCE, 
the World Human Rights Conference, etc. The aim would be to end 
the genocide and to restore order in this region on the basis of 
the UN Charter of international law. This is to stop the 
aggression directed against Bosnia-Herzegovina if the aggressor 
does not want to conclude a real peace. Unfortunately, we 
cannot make peace -- we have not made war. Neither do we have 
the means to (?conclude) peace. One thing is important -- 
lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina, it is 
argued, would only add fuel to the fire in Bosnia. But we all 
know that our postwar peace rested on a balance of power and 
that principle worked for 50 years. Precisely this principle, 
alongside many others, has been abandoned in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
You have said that we will not give you weapons, but we cannot 
help you either. 
  The outcome is very clear and it is that the Serb aggressors 
have conquered Bosnian territory and are naturally refusing to 
withdraw because no force is used against them. They are 
dealing with a defenseless population with very few arms. This 
imbalance is leading to yet more war. If there is a balance of 
forces there is no war. That is the problem we have. We hope 
the time has come to take action, either by restoring this 
balance so that we can make peace ourselves through the balance 
of forces, or by the international community either putting 
pressure on the Serbs or intervening itself. 
  [Correspondent] Does this mean that you will not return to 
the Geneva negotiating table to discuss the Owen-Stoltenberg 
plan, which foresees the division of your country into three 
parts, a Muslim, a Croatian and a Serb part? 
  [Silajdzic] I think it was very explicit from the statement 
that I gave you that we are looking for a negotiated solution. 
We have taken part in all negotiating processes and are still 
prepared to do so. But our people are dying every day while we 
travel from one meeting to the next. Civilians are dying every 
day in our towns, in Sarajevo, in Mostar, in Tuzla, in Zenica, 
and in other towns. It is like a medieval siege of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, an aggression and, without any doubt, 
genocide. The international community therefore has an 
obligation, and if negotiations fail, then other measures have 
to be taken. 
  Otherwise, the Bosnians must assume that they have been 
condemned to death by the international community. Many people 
in Bosnia already believe that by its attitude, by its wish not 
to get involved, the international community has intervened on 
the part of the aggressor, has facilitated the position of the 
aggressor by disarming us and has thus condemned us to death.

  [Text] Ejup Ganic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Presidency, today gave an interview to VJESNIK of Zagreb, the 
Slovene daily VECER, and FERAL of Split. 
  I am not an optimist when it comes to signing the agreement 
as envisaged by Lord Owen. Both the agreement and its draft 
will resolve nothing in Bosnia. In other words, it is merely an 
academic paper that neither tackles the essence nor raises the 
main issues facing this state. 
  We would like to avoid the war option but we expect Serbia 
to 
launch a new attack. The regime in Serbia sees the continuation 
of the war as crucial for its survival. However, they are not 
as strong as they think they are. They have artillery, criminal 
units, but they have no popular army. On the opposite side they 
are facing an army of volunteers. 
  As for the Croatian state, which has disintegrated on all 
fronts and which is trying to step up its aggression against a 
sovereign state, it is obvious that Tudjman's behavior is 
preparing the ground for sanctions against Croatia, Ganic 
stressed. 
  In eastern Bosnia, we will not allow homes and the land 
belonging to Bosniak Muslims to be taken over by a single Serb 
family. My message to the Serbs is this: Do not go there, do 
not move into houses and land that belong to someone else. 
Something terrible will happen to you, today, tomorrow, the day 
after tomorrow, or in six months, it does not matter. Those 
whom you have expelled have nowhere to go. They are strangers 
in both Sarajevo and Vienna. The solution is to return these 
people to where they came from, Ganic said. 
  The proposal for a union [in Bosnia-Herzegovina] will be 
difficult to implement, Ganic said. If we are to accept the 
proposal, at least 1 million people will have to be resettled. 
To resettle them we would need at least $2 million daily or 
about $700 million annually to relieve the misery of these 
people. The union proposal is not a serious one because it does 
not reflect reality. We are not in the process of setting up a 
Muslim state. We want to create a state of Bosnia with Croats, 
Serbs, and Bosniak Muslims living in it. I think that the idea 
of a Muslim state was planted on us and has, in the meantime, 
become transparent. Here the feeling of patriotism is much 
stronger than any other passion. I am in favor of Bosnia as a 
state of Bosniak Muslims, Serbs, and Croats but am not in favor 
of an artificial peace. I advocate the rule of law. 
  It is realistic to expect a turnabout in Croatia's policy in 
Bosnia. Its policy will hit rock bottom unless Tudjman has 
reached an agreement to hand over the occupied territories in 
Croatia to Milosevic. This would signal an end to Croatia as a 
state, Ejup Ganic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, 
said in his interview to VJESNIK and VECER.

<F P=106> [Statement by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic after </F>
talks with (Sergio Demel), adviser to UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali, in Pale on 3 January -- recorded] 
  [Text] We have agreed that there is no animosity between 
the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] and the Serb side, that the 
Serbs are very cooperative in that respect, but that some 
[humanitarian] convoys are being delayed because of 
irregularities in the convoys themselves. Either there is no 
permission to search the entire convoy, or there are too many 
people or things, and our soldiers abide strictly to what they 
have on their lists. We might show a bit more flexibility 
toward UNPROFOR there. However, we do have to be somewhat 
cautious since the Muslims are doubtless getting weapons and 
ammunition, that is beyond any doubt. 
  We would never accuse the UNPROFOR Command. We know that 
General Briquemont and all his officers are exceptionally 
professional and honorable soldiers, but individuals are 
probably smuggling arms for money. We have to be very cautious 
there as we do not want the war to be prolonged.

  [Text] Jadranko Prlic, president of the government of the 
Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, has sent a letter to the 
Government of Croatia in reaction to the conduct of the Muslim 
side and the latest developments in central Bosnia. 
  In his letter Jadranko Prlic notes that at their last 
session 
the Chamber of Deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna 
and the government of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna 
discussed the political and military situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina with special emphasis on the course of 
negotiations on the future political system in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The common view is that in the negotiations 
so far, the Croat delegation has made most concessions and that 
any further concessions to other sides in the negotiations would 
not only place the Croat nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina in an 
unequal position toward the two other constituent nations but 
would directly threaten its survival. 
  The Muslim army continues to attack the Croat people, 
especially in central Bosnia. At the same time top Muslim 
politicians have openly threatened to pursue their territorial 
conquest of the centuries-old Croat homes in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In view of the above, the Republic of Croatia is called on 
to 
reexamine its overall relations with the Republic of Bosnia- 
Herzegovina where -- contrary to its constitution -- decisions 
are now being made by authorities that are exclusively under 
Muslim control. 
  The letter also contains a request to annul the document by 
which the Republic of Croatia recognized Bosnia-Herzegovina, in 
view of the fact that since the recognition major changes have 
been made in the foundations of constitutionality of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina by the fact that the Muslim side has achieved 
illegitimate dominance. 
  In addition, we ask the Republic of Croatia to end its 
participation in the talks on the future organization of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina unless the Muslim side halts its offensive in 
central Bosnia and provides firm guarantees that it will end its 
aggression against our people, the president of the government 
of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna says in his letter to the 
Government of the Republic of Croatia.

<F P=106> [Statement by Sefik Teslic, president of the Zepce War </F>
Presidency, to Sarajevo Radio; place and date not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] The town of Zepce and parts of the commune are 
temporarily occupied by the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] and 
its most extremist segment, the ustashas. However, there is a 
large part of the territory that is free. We have consolidated 
there, politically and militarily, as a precondition for the 
liberation of the entire territory and linking with the 
surrounding territories of Tesanj, Maglaj, and Teslic communes. 
  The true faces of all who were, until yesterday, our alleged 
friends and neighbors have been clearly shown by the example of 
Zepce. The ustashas and the chetniks have jointly done what 
they have done. However, I am truly puzzled that the Serbs have 
forgotten what the ustashas have done [words indistinct] they 
have committed a massacre upon the innocent civilians on that 
occasion, but are now friends with a common objective of 
destroying everything Muslim. 
  The trust in neighbors, peace, and respect for oneself and 
one's property has backfired on Zepce in the most brutal 
possible way. Bearing in mind the betrayal and humiliating 
surrender of a great part of the command and soldiers, a clear 
message remains to all Zepce residents regardless of where they 
are: To those who have not done so yet, join a brigade as 
quickly as possible; to those who can help in any other possible 
way, do this immediately to help the brigade that has been 
formed very hastily with the help of other brigades which are 
situated on the free territory of Zepce commune and which are 
taking an active part in the combat. 
  We shall return to Zepce. We do not doubt this. We will 
punish all criminals, ustashas, and Mate Boban. To those who 
did not bloody their hands and commit crimes, we will guarantee 
freedom and life together. We know who the criminals are and 
what they have done, and they have done many things not 
befitting civilized people.

<F P=106> [Interview with Macedonian Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski </F>
by correspondent Giorgio Atteni; place and date not given; 
Crvenkovski speaks in Serbo-Croatian with correspondent's 
superimposed translation -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Atteni] In Macedonia, where a 
quarter of the population are ethnic Albanians, nationalist 
factions are raising their profiles. Macedonia is the only 
former Yugoslav republic to have gained its independence 
peacefully, and it is an example of the cohabitation of 
different ethnic groups, which is more unique than rare in these 
parts. The Albanians are even represented in the government, 
run by Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski, who is only 32 years 
old. 
  What is the present situation like on the borders with 
Serbia 
and your other neighbors? There is talk of illegal trafficking 
and of the embargo being violated. 
  [Crvenkovski] Extremist Albanians in Macedonia, Kosovo, and 
Tirana, dream of a greater Albania. This plan is embarrassing 
for the authorities in Tirana, with whom we have good relations. 
If Kosovo were to explode, the war would be more devastating 
than the present one. The Albanians in Macedonia would rush to 
support their brothers, and Serbia could take advantage of this 
to invade our country. At this point Bulgaria, which recognized 
us and with which we now have good relations, would come forward 
with its ancient territorial claims. Even Greece, in which 
there is a Macedonian region, would be involved.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Petrovich Trushin, representative of </F>
the Russian Federation in Macedonia, by Moscow correspondent 
Mirce Adamcevski in Moscow; date not given: "Macedonian Policy 
-- the Future in the Balkans"] 
  [Text] Moscow, December. [date as published] The Russian 
Federation has recently appointed Yuriy Petrovich Trushin as its 
permanent representative to the Republic of Macedonia. He is a 
professional diplomat, involved in the Balkans for 20 years. 
His dissertation was on the Balkans, and he has also written a 
number of scientific works related to this region. He has spent 
more than 10 years working in the diplomatic service in 
Bulgaria. This year, he has been engaged in the global problems 
of that part of Europe. He has been professionally and 
scientifically linked to the Balkans for more than 20 years. 
  [Adamcevski] Mr. Trushin, how do you view your appointment 
to the post of permanent representative of the Russian 
Federation in Macedonia? 
  [Trushin] This appointment to Macedonia is a great honor for 
me. The Macedonian people are few in number, but have a deep 
and old culture, and if we look at the history of the Balkans, 
it cannot be disassociated from Macedonia. Moreover, our two 
peoples are closely connected through close blood, religious, 
and historic links. As you know, Russia was christened (it 
accepted Christianity) and became a Christian country through 
the great merit of the Ohrid Exarchate. We know that Kiev 
Russia had strong relations with Ohrid. There are numerous 
other examples in history when the two countries and peoples had 
active cooperation. From that aspect, it is a great honor and 
duty for me to be appointed to Macedonia. I say great duty 
because, unfortunately, the history of the Macedonian people was 
carried on in such a way that many in Macedonia know a lot about 
Russia, but only a few in Russia know about Macedonia. That 
will be one of my basic goals, to get to know that country 
better and to bring the truth about that people to the brotherly 
Russian people. 
  [Adamcevski] You have now touched the next question. What 
other aims will be basic to your activities? 
  [Trushin] I have already mentioned them: The intensification 
of the traditional friendship and cooperation between our two 
peoples. The second goal is to get to know the history and 
culture of that people, to study the present situation, and to 
inform my leadership, my government, my people. One of the most 
important goals of my stay in Macedonia, as a representative of 
the Russian Federation, will be to make our people, our country, 
realize the guarantee of stability and independence of the 
Macedonian people. The policy conducted by Russia in Macedonia 
should contribute to stability and peace in that country. In 
brief, these will be the goals during my stay in Macedonia. 
  [Adamcevski] What is your opinion of the present situation 
in Macedonia within the framework of the Balkans? 
  [Trushin] I think that the policy led by President Kiro 
Gligorov, who enjoys great respect in our country, and this has 
been confirmed during the numerous discussions and meetings I 
have had with my leadership, is the best policy, because his 
policy is directed toward good neighboring relations with the 
neighboring countries. That is an example of how the future 
policy in the Balkans should be, despite the fact that this is 
the time when Macedonia is surrounded by furious passions, wars, 
and interethnic disputes. Thanks to its leadership, thanks to 
the fact that the Macedonians are a very peaceful people, of 
good intentions, it can be said that Macedonia has succeeded in 
being the only states of former Yugoslavia to have avoided those 
events. Here, I think that this policy of peace, good 
neighboring relations, and cooperation with the neighbors, in my 
opinion, is the main orientation in the policy of Macedonia. On 
that plan, Macedonia will always have support from Russia, from 
our government, and leadership. 
  [Adamcevski] Can you tell us about your views on the future 
development of the situation in Macedonia? 
  [Trushin] It is ungrateful to forecast policy. However, the 
way it seems to me, the fact we are now witnessing a broad 
process of recognition of Macedonia by the European countries, 
by the world, proves a full recognition of the peaceful policy 
of Macedonia. My opinion is that the line of international 
recognition of Macedonia, neglecting the known difficulties, 
represents a chance for Macedonian perspectives, for overcoming 
those difficulties, for it becoming a full and equal member of 
the world's community on its road to civilized development. 
  [Adamcevski] What will be your role and the role of the 
Russian Federation in that direction? 
  [Trushin] If we reduce all that to Russian-Macedonian 
relations, I would like to mention that Russia was the first of 
the superpowers to recognize Macedonia. It recognized its 
independence on 4 August last year, by the act of our President 
Boris Yeltsin. Then our Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev paid a 
visit to Macedonia, followed by his deputy Vitaliy Churkin. In 
implementing the act of President Yeltsin, official inter-state 
relations were established between the two countries and 
respective representatives were appointed. My leadership has 
entrusted me with the task of going to the spot and learning 
about the situation in Macedonia, and then I am expected to 
submit adequate proposals to our leadership and government in 
compliance with the development of the situation. 
  [Adamcevski] What is your opinion of the presence of the UN 
forces in Macedonia? 
  [Trushin] Our line in that direction is clear and 
consistent. If those forces contribute to the development of 
stability and the reinforcement of peace in Macedonia, to its 
economic growth and security, we can then welcome such a 
presence. 
  [Adamcevski] However, some Russian media said that Russia 
had abandoned the Balkans, asking about the reason for the 
presence of the Americans there, that is in Macedonia. 
  [Trushin] First of all, we look at the presence of the 
Americans within the framework of the UN forces. On the other 
hand, I think that such an aspect appears as a remnant of the 
ideological concept of the division of the world between the two 
superpowers. Now, we are developing a Russian policy on the 
indispensable Partnership for Peace, for which we meet 
understanding in the Western world. Therefore, any actions, 
Russian, U.S., or some other countries', must contribute to the 
reinforcement of stability, of good neighborliness. The 
ideological remnants must be excluded from these actions, as 
well as the confrontations and the division of the world between 
two systems. That is why we consider that our role, I would 
say, in assisting Macedonia, will mean a continuation in the 
direction followed hitherto. If the U.S. policy leads to 
stability and development in Macedonia, we shall welcome it and 
we shall cooperate with the Americans. 
  [Adamcevski] You know that a great part of the Macedonian 
foreign trade exchange was linked to the USSR, that is Russia. 
What will you do, now that the exchange has been lowered, to 
promote this situation? 
  [Trushin] With the breaking up of the USSR and Yugoslavia, 
the traditional trade relations have been remarkably weakened. 
It does not affect only the former republics of the USSR and 
Yugoslavia, because it is a larger process. Let me note that 
Macedonia was the only one of the former Yugoslav republics that 
imported more than it exported to the USSR. This is a very 
significant detail. Our analyses show that there are 
possibilities for increasing Macedonian exports to Russia. Our 
side is pleased to show great interest in textiles and small 
industry. Our large market is interested in tobacco, in shoes, 
and in many other products bought in Macedonia. There is a 
mutual interest with the Macedonians, too. Now that the economy 
is being restructured, it is very important to start direct 
links and contacts between the respective companies. In that 
framework, I view my mission in Macedonia as a possibility for 
promoting economic cooperation to a higher level. It will be a 
great contribution if Russia helps Macedonia get back on its 
feet. That is extremely valuable. For that purpose it was 
decided, right after my appointment, to also appoint an economic 
counselor to Macedonia. It demonstrates that we have put the 
issue of foreign trade relations in the first place. 
  [Adamcevski] Would you like to add something I have failed 
to ask about? 
  [Trushin] I would like to say that the characteristic of my 
mission is that, compared to representatives and ambassadors 
appointed to, so to say, "worked out" countries, I am starting 
an unusual mission in that aspect. Unfortunately, that was due 
to history itself, therefore there are no experts on the 
Macedonian language, on the Macedonian history, and so on. 
Therefore, in addition to my everyday obligations, I shall be 
also learning the language, the country.... In that 
perspective, my contacts with Macedonian historians, linguists, 
and people of culture, will play a great role for me. On that 
plan, we must use the links among the scientists of the two 
countries, as well as the existing potentials. There are such 
ideas now. When it became clear I was going to Macedonia, I was 
visited by some representatives of the intelligentsia, the mass 
media, some scientists, and they came out with the idea of 
opening a Russian House in Macedonia, which would be the only 
one in the Balkans. Therefore, it would be a Russian House 
accumulating the spiritual wealth of the Russian people, which 
we would generously share with our brothers, the Macedonian 
people. This idea has already been accepted by Macedonia. I 
have already had meetings with your eminent writers and artists. 
The government circles have also accepted it with pleasure and 
approval. It will be the first step in introducing the two 
peoples that have traditional and cultural links. There are 
also other ideas, but this is the first major one, and I, as the 
first representative of the Russian Federation, would like to 
realize it. I think it will also be well accepted by the 
neighboring countries. I think they will have an understanding 
for that, so that we can expand the cooperation. 
  And finally, I would like to wish the Macedonian brotherly 
people success in overcoming the present difficulties and in 
making Macedonia a flourishing state in the family of civilized 
nations.

<H5>  Promptness for Better Mutual Cooperation </H5>
  Yesterday, President of the Republic of Macedonia Kiro 
Gligorov received a protocol visit of the official 
representative of the Russian Federation in our country, Yuriy 
Petrovich Trushin. 
  The Russian representative conveyed to President Gligorov 
the 
cordial greetings and new year's wishes of President of the 
Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin and the Russian leadership, 
emphasizing their readiness to promote further relations and 
cooperation with Macedonia in the interest of the two nations 
and countries, for peace and stability in the region. 
  President Gligorov expressed his gratitude and returned the 
greetings and wishes, emphasizing that Macedonia is following 
with great attention and pleasure the efforts of President 
Yeltsin and the Russian leadership to further democracy in 
Russian society and peace in the world. Gligorov also talked 
about the possibilities for, and interest in, an ample 
cooperation in all fields of mutual interest, based on the 
historical links between the two countries and on the democratic 
developments in both countries. 
  President Gligorov welcomed the opening of the Office of the 
Russian Federation in Macedonia and expressed his hopes that it 
would soon grow into an embassy. 
  Discussions were also held on the current issues regarding 
Macedonian-Russian relations, on the situation in both the 
countries, as well as on the situation in the Balkans. This was 
stated by the Cabinet of the president of the Republic of 
Macedonia.

<F P=106> [Report by Krystyna Grzybowska from Bonn: "Without </F>
Ally-Type Commitments; Olechowski and Kinkel on European 
Security"] 
  [Text] Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski wants the 
terms and the timeframe for accepting Poland into NATO to be 
clearly defined. He paid a short working visit to Bonn. It was 
his first visit to Germany as the chief of Polish diplomacy. 
  German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said he had made a 
deliberate decision to invite Minister Olechowski to visit Bonn 
as the first foreign guest of the New Year. During the meeting 
the following topics were discussed: Poland's efforts to join 
the European Union, the Western European Union, as well as NATO 
-- these constitute a block of issues linked with creating 
European security. 
  Minister Kinkel said during a press conference that Germany 
will continue to be an advocate of the Polish cause in Europe. 
"It is obvious," Kinkel said, "that Poland should want to leave 
the security grey area through its integration with NATO and 
with the remaining organizations of European security." 
According to the German foreign minister, during the NATO 
summit on 10 January fundamental decisions will be made 
concerning the opening up of NATO to the East, but it will not 
be possible for new countries to join the Alliance in the 
nearest future. Decisions will be made during the summit on 
coming to some agreements, but these agreements will not contain 
ally-type commitments. But Minister Kinkel thinks that closer 
cooperation between Poland and NATO will be possible; this could 
be -- among others -- joint military maneuvers or joint peace 
missions. 
  Polish public opinion has high expectations in connection 
with the NATO summit. "Poland wants to be a member of the 
Western family of countries," Minister Olechowski said, "which 
also means being a member of the European Union and of NATO. It 
will not happen tomorrow but it is our desire to have a clear 
and specific prospect opened up before us. Apart from Poland 
itself and the NATO members, nobody can decide whether we should 
join the Alliance or not," Minister Olechowski also stressed. 
  That statement corresponded to one made by Minister Kinkel. 
When replying to a question asked by a German journalist, 
Minister Kinkel recalled that during talks with Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev he pointed out that Russia has not had 
the right of veto in NATO nor will it ever have it in the 
future, but at the same time he assured Kozyrev that Russia's 
sensitivity will be taken into account. The Germans are in 
favor of NATO adopting the kind of solution that would take into 
account the interests of both the countries of Central Europe 
and of Russia. 
  Minister Kinkel did not talk about "Partnership for Peace." 
Only Minister Olechowski mentioned it by pointing out that 
Poland expects the kind of partnership that would not mean 
giving up full membership in the future. "We can be satisfied 
with that part of the talks," Minister Olechowski said, and he 
suggested that Poland also take part in providing assistance to 
Russia and other eastern neighbors. 
  The Polish and German foreign ministers also discussed 
bilateral relations of our two countries, but -- as Minister 
Kinkel said -- they are so close that there are no major 
differences of opinions.

<F P=106> [Article by Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski: </F>
"Poland and the North Atlantic Alliance"] 
  [Text] A sensible foreign policy should always take two 
viewpoints into consideration: one's own and that of the 
partner. For Poland, participation in NATO is the synonym for 
national security. For the signatories of the North Atlantic 
Alliance there arises the question of whether the gradual 
expansion of NATO by the Central European states is in their 
interest and, if so, whether Poland -- alone or in the Visegrad 
group -- should initiate this process. There is no doubt that 
these two viewpoints are not identical. However, they can prove 
to be convergent, if we weigh the motives and needs, the 
benefits, and the potential risks for all parties involved, 
soberly and without prejudice. 
  Unfortunately any important foreign policy problem is 
shrouded in myth, which makes it more difficult to solve. In 
our case, too, there is often a strange MYTHOLOGY OF FEAR 
[capitals as published] that replaces realistic assessments and 
courageous visions. 
  Myth number one: In NATO it is feared that by expanding to 
the uncertain zone of Central and Eastern Europe, the alliance 
might be dragged into local conflicts, for the settlement of 
which it is prepared neither politically, nor militarily, nor 
psychologically. After all, the alliance was formed to defend 
the West against aggression from the outside and not to get 
involved in situations that do not directly threaten its 
members' security. 
  Such fears seem to be nourished by events in the former 
Yugoslavia. However, even if we bow in pain to the suffering of 
these people and entire ethnic groups, we must soberly note that 
the situation in the former Yugoslavia has nothing in common 
with the situation in Central and Eastern Europe. One can 
assume with certainty that potential misunderstandings between 
individual nationalities in this area do not harbor the danger 
of bloody conflicts. 
  This applies all the more to Poland, which is ethnically 
almost homogeneous and has managed in the course of the past few 
years to establish friendly, goodneighborly relations with all 
neighbors and to settle all border and nationality issues by 
treaties. 
  Myth number two: Russia is afraid of NATO. Certainly, one 
should not underestimate the remnants of old enemy images -- in 
particular in the Army. Neither the solemn statement by the 
North Atlantic Cooperation Council in 1990-91 nor the tell-tale 
changes in the doctrine and the organization of the NATO forces 
have been able to completely abolish this enemy image. However, 
this myth takes into consideration neither the changes that have 
already occurred nor the dynamism of the further development of 
Russia's relations both with NATO and its individual member 
states. The Russian statements that relations between NATO and 
Russia should be better than NATO's relations with the states in 
Central and Eastern Europe demonstrate how unfounded this myth 
is. 
  Instead of NATO, Russia points other states to the CSCE. We 
understand the efforts to strengthen the CSCE and, on principle, 
we share them. However, we are of the opinion that the CSCE 
cannot replace NATO as a collective self-defense system in the 
foreseeable future. On the other hand, it can and should play a 
more important and more effective role. Therefore, together 
with Germany, Russia, and other states, we are in favor of 
considerably expanding the powers of the CSCE, in particular in 
the field of conflict prevention as well as arms limitation and 
control. 
  Myth number three: Poland is afraid of Russia and, 
therefore, wants to isolate it from Europe with a "cordon 
sanitaire." This myth is particularly absurd. It is simply not 
possible to isolate Russia and, if it were possible, it would be 
a mistake. In Poland such action would be prevented by 
political and economic aspects as well as by strong cultural and 
ethnic ties. Poland is against Russia's isolation. To put it 
even more clearly: In our view, no European security system 
will work without the participation of a democratic and strong 
Russia -- neither in the short term nor in the long run. A 
democratic and strong Russia will be the strongest guarantee for 
peace and stability in Europe. 
  Thus, we are not afraid of Russia but only of objective 
situations that might provoke it to actions dangerous to Poland. 
Such a case is the current security vacuum in Central Europe. 
"Nature abhors a vacuum," the Romans noted. In Poland's case it 
is particularly artificial and provoking, because it is located 
between two giants -- Germany and Russia. The consolidation of 
this vacuum would provoke these two states into considering 
Poland either as a buffer state in the classical sense of the 
19th century or as an area, where the respective spheres of 
influence clash. One does not need any proof that both cases 
would be detrimental not only to Poland's interests but also to 
Europe's stability. The common denominator of these three myths 
is easy to see. The concern and the fears do not develop from 
the friend-foe pattern but from the structural incompleteness of 
the European security system. Therefore, the construction of 
its new architecture is very important. 
  This term is, perhaps, not quite adequate as regards the 
current and future situation, because it lacks dynamism. At the 
moment, it is not so much the creation of new elements that is 
important but active cooperation of the already existing ones 
and their adjustment to the new situation. The European 
security architecture of the near future will not be of the 
classical style but rather of the baroque, with its flowing and 
interlaced elements. 
  At all levels of this construction Polish diplomacy has 
made an essential contribution and intends to continue doing so. 
We have settled the bilateral security issue with all the old 
and new neighbors. At the supraregional level Poland is trying 
to support initiatives such as the Visegrad group, the Central 
European Initiative, or the institutions of the Baltic Sea 
littoral states, which do not deal directly with political 
security aspects but strengthen the climate of cooperation and 
contribute to stability in Europe. At the pan-European level 
Poland has played an active role in arms limitation negotiations 
as well as confidence and security-building measures. 
  We watch the activation of the Western European Union [WEU] 
with great attention. We do not see the WEU as an alternative 
but as a supplement to NATO and consider it to be NATO's 
increasingly strong European pillar. The WEU's close relation 
to the process of European integration makes it the natural 
forum of cooperation between those states, which have -- like 
Poland -- already linked their future with this integration. 
  At the global level we recognize the need to strengthen the 
powers and functions of the UN Security Council in safeguarding 
and reestablishing peace. 
  Thus, we are convinced that European security must be 
established at different levels in different forms. I can 
describe our altitude by paraphrasing the proverb that 
"everything is politics, but politics is not everything." The 
same goes for the question of the North Atlantic Alliance: 
"Everything is linked with NATO, but NATO alone is not 
everything for Europe's security." 
  At the same time, we are firmly convinced that NATO remains 
irreplaceable for the foreseeable future. First, as an anchor 
safeguarding the United States of Europe, one that we consider 
absolutely indispensable as a guarantor of peace on the 
continent and Poland's security. Second, as a mechanism that 
ensures the harmless self-realization of German power in harmony 
with the interests of other European peoples. Third, as the 
only fully organized, experienced, and powerful military 
organization that would be able to stand up to a potential 
aggressor. Fourth, as an alliance of peoples who represent 
common values rooted in Greek culture, Roman law, and Christian 
religion. 
  I have already mentioned that Poland does not mean any 
threat 
to NATO in the sense of a "Balkanization." Even more: As a 
member of NATO, Poland would not only not be a burden but would 
even be a trump card. The increasingly consolidated political 
stability, the continuity of the economic reforms, the visible 
signs of an economic upswing, the strengthening of civilian 
control over the military -- all this makes Poland an 
increasingly essential element of European order and democracy 
in this part of the continent -- and this in its most sensitive 
geostrategic area, in the narrowing between the Baltic Sea and 
the Carpathians. 
  Above all, however, accepting Poland into NATO would be a 
first step toward ending the division of Europe into different 
security areas and levels. This would be the beginning of an 
evolution of the European security system toward indivisibility, 
universality, and mutuality. 
  A process aimed at a specific goal: Apart from a handful of 
Polish politicians who demanded the immediate acceptance of 
Poland into NATO in spring 1992, all serious political parties 
and the overwhelming majority of our people agree that Poland's 
membership in NATO will be preceded by a complicated process. 
Both in Poland and abroad, a number of ideas for step-by-step 
solutions and partial approaches have emerged. We brush none of 
them aside right from the beginning. We will insist on only one 
criterion: The purpose and goal of these projects must be 
Poland's approach to full membership in NATO -- and not putting 
it off, feeding it with hopes, or pushing it on the sidetrack of 
half-way solutions. 
  This also applies to the particularly topical initiative of 
the "partnership for peace" that U.S. President Clinton has 
proposed. We see it as an important initiative for a Europe 
that is not divided into blocs or security spheres and that 
would be characterized by democratic values, rule-of-law 
principles, free market economy, and the openness of European 
society toward the extra-European world. This shows that the 
initiative of the "partnership for peace" should extend to all 
countries that fulfill these conditions. It should, however, 
also clearly communicate (to the interested states) the final 
goal -- namely membership in the Atlantic Alliance for those who 
fulfill the specific criteria. The lack of such a prospect 
would reduce the support of the parliaments and the public for 
the idea of a "partnership for peace" in the affected countries 
and also the dynamism of the initiative. There would be the 
impression that the West wanted to keep these countries in a 
"gray zone of insecurity" forever. This would give rise to a 
trend toward nationalist tendencies in these countries, provoke 
a negative attitude toward international cooperation, and make 
them withdraw like a snail into their own shell. At the same 
time, imperialist desires might again emerge in neighboring 
states. 
  The framework agreement on the partnership should not be 
general. On the contrary, it should set down as precisely as 
possible the criteria and conditions for participating in the 
"partnership for peace," including: Transparency of the 
military budgets, civilian supervision of the armed forces, 
non-deployment of armed forces on foreign territory without 
approval by the affected states, observing all obligations in 
the field of disarmament, arms control, as well as security and 
confidence-building measures. 
  The "partnership for peace" should also further develop the 
contents of Article 4 of the Washington Agreement, by noting, 
for instance, that the consultations envisaged there in the case 
of a threat to the inviolability of the territory, the political 
independence, or the security of one or several partners, can 
also lead to common action with the goal of safeguarding or 
reestablishing peace. 
  In addition, bilateral agreements on specific fields and 
forms of cooperation with NATO should make it possible to take 
into consideration the specific geographical location, the 
interests, needs, and security problems of the individual 
countries as well as their progress in the process of 
democratization. This would result in a positive 
diversification of forms and scope of cooperation. 
  I hope that the NATO summit will take our proposals into 
consideration and publicly state its conviction that the 
security of Poland and the other Central European countries is 
part of NATO's basic interests -- because their security is 
closely linked with NATO's own security.

  [Text] Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak today met members of 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. According to Prime Minister 
Pawlak the results of the economic transformations in Poland are 
appreciated by international financial organizations such as the 
World Bank, the IMF and the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development. 
  [Begin Pawlak recording] In 1994 we expect that Polish gross 
domestic product to grow by about 4.5 percent, exports to 
increase by 6 percent and investment by 6 percent. We envisage 
that the annual rate of inflation in this period will decrease, 
falling to about 25 percent. The government is continuing the 
process of reforms, the foundation of which is formed by a 
market economy and the principle of free economic management, as 
well as by the demonopolization of foreign economic relations. 
  The government will also continue the processes of ownership 
transformations, although here we want to use the criterion of 
efficiency as the primary criterion. We are interested in 
creating conditions for a free flow of goods, services, capital 
and people. At the same time we need a greater openness of 
foreign markets to our goods, as well as increased interest of 
foreign entrepreneurs in investment projects in Poland. [end

<F P=106> [Interview with Andrzej Drzycimski, press spokesman for </F>
President Lech Walesa, by Piotr Swiac on the "Directly From the 
Belvedere" program; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Swiac] Mr. Minister, since this is our first 
interview in the New Year, I would like to ask you to recap last 
year. President Lech Walesa is not satisfied with the year 1993. 
  [Drzycimski] Everyone has a kind of dissatisfaction because 
the development of democracy in Poland -- which by the way could 
be seen in this past year -- could have resulted in more 
achievements and in bringing about greater effects, the kind of 
effects whose impact the citizens of the country would feel 
directly; and I mean they would have to feel a very clear impact 
in a legislative sense, the kind of legislation which would 
allow the overcoming of some deadlocks, especially in the 
economic area, and which would allow moving on with issues that 
have been dragging for years now, beginning with the famous 
issue of the Treasury, and also of customs stamping 
[banderolowanie] and many other issues as well. These issues 
have been debated, deliberated on, and dealt with many times, 
but they subsequently dragged slowly either through Sejm 
commissions or during later Sejm debates, and so these issues 
required a push. And that kind of push was exactly what was 
missing. And that is precisely what the waste of time is about, 
that is .... 
  [Swiac, interrupting] But Mr. Minister, I am sorry to 
interrupt you like this, but many people accuse the president of 
having submitted relatively few legislative initiatives. 
  [Drzycimski] The president has focused on the main issues 
that constitute the state and its structures, he has focused 
mainly on the legal framework defining the political system of 
the country, including having submitted a few legislative 
proposals aimed at -- first of all -- the Electoral Laws, the 
constitutional system, that is the Small Constitution, a 
proposal for a constitutional framework for the country in the 
future -- these factors determine the political system's nature. 
Recently we also had the president submit a Rights and Freedoms 
Charter, he also submitted a proposal for making the 
Constitutional Tribunal independent -- all these determine and 
constitute a democratic and sovereign state with three clear 
pillars: The parliament, the executive authority, and the 
judiciary. 
  [Swiac] In that case, could one not have a grievance 
precisely against the president about his lack of efficiency? 
After all, efficiency is something that should be present at a 
post this high. 
  [Drzycimski] Well, I can you see you are going back to a 
constitutional dispute, a dispute on what Poland should be like: 
Should it be a democracy of a presidential-parliamentary type, 
or should it be one of a parliamentary-cabinet type? The 
president's view is that deciding in favor of one or the other 
option is a question of choice. But he also thinks that in this 
transitional period that we are in -- by the way, it is not just 
him but also many legal experts and politicians think that, too 
-- the executive authority should be strengthened to make it 
more effective and to render it able to make decisions faster. 
That is why the president is in favor of a 
presidential-parliamentary system, but he also says the issue 
remains open, and the decision is up to the nation, and we will 
certainly debate the Constitution. 
  [Swiac] December was the third anniversary of Lech Walesa's 
term as president, and on that occasion, former prime ministers 
of the Third Republic expressed their views on the president's 
term. There were some positive views expressed but there were 
also plenty of critical ones. Tadeusz Mazowiecki would like 
Lech Walesa to contribute to returning the presidency to its 
grand qualities, so as to prevent the person performing the 
state's supreme post from getting involved in immediate 
political maneuvers. 
  [Drzycimski] But you ignored here other views which were 
expressed as well. 
  [Swiac] Fine, let us take another statement. Former Prime 
Minister Jan Olszewski said: To me, President Lech Walesa is a 
major disappointment. 
  [Drzycimski] But you still left out some other statements. 
  [Swiac] I am sure there were also other kinds of views but I 
would like to hear you comment on what I cited. 
  [Drzycimski] You seem to be citing here only critical 
statements made on the presidency, and it is a good thing that 
we have them. It is not the case that a politician or even the 
state as a whole can function without any arguments. It is good 
that the president has been arousing such passionate debates 
since everyone has a right to think in his own mind, as it were, 
about what it is that he expects -- using his own judgment -- 
from the president. Not only we here in Poland have been making 
judgments, but also the world has been judging us, so let us 
look from the perspective of that broader kind of view. Our 
domestic, Polish view is important -- by all means -- in terms 
of our achievements and failures, and on this issue there are 
all kinds of things to be listed. But what is also important is 
the view of Poland from the perspective of our current position 
in Europe and the world. The time of peace, the time of 
political stabilization and of this kind of special treatment of 
Poland so to speak -- this is all over. And it is only thanks 
to Poland being so active, thanks to the president's initiatives 
and proposals finding their way not only to the desks 
[presumably of foreign politicians], but also contributing to 
the debate, I would even say they are a cause of this major 
debate on the future of Europe. 
  [Swiac] Mr. Minister, but let us go back to domestic issues. 
Would you not agree with me that during this past year the 
president's measures have not been perceived very well by 
society, and there are some results of research conducted by 
agencies which deal with that kind of work, to back it up? I 
think the views expressed by the press on the president have 
also been getting worse and worse. 
  [Drzycimski] The president has become a lightning-rod of his 
own kind. If something bad happens or if something 
inappropriate is going on -- who is to blame? Lech Walesa. 
Why? Because of this and that, and then the list goes on and 
on. But nobody pays attention to the fact that if the president 
was really responsible for all that is expected of him .... 
[pauses] He has not been given enough powers. That is why the 
president says: Let us establish some fundamentals and some 
principles which would be the state's pillars, or a fundamental 
plan. He has been saying that over and over again for years 
now. Every new governing team or coalition that takes over 
power says: Yes, that is correct. We can hear such views also 
in the case of this latest coalition. But once the time comes 
for implementing that in practice, these coalitions kind of take 
back what they had said. The mass media evaluate President Lech 
Walesa by judging from first looks, as it were, and they are not 
making an effort to look for a deeper kind of measure, while I 
think that.... 
  [Swiac, interrupting] Mr. Minister, perhaps this deeper kind 
of measure that you are talking about should be made more 
specific. One can conclude from what you are saying that there 
is no understanding, or that there is no transformation of the 
president's ideas into practical measures, while I think the 
mass media are an excellent means to accomplishing just that. 
  [Drzycimski] Yes. This very program here can serve as an 
example. After all, this television program which began last 
year, serves to familiarize society with what the president 
does. Of course one can debate whether the program's formula is 
good or bad, but from the letters that have been coming into the 
President's Office and to me personally, I perceive something 
different: Namely, it can be concluded from those letters that 
the program has been enjoying an ever-increasing social 
interest, and that is because in one way or another it shows 
those parts of what the president does which were absent from 
the media for two years. Only those aspects were present which 
were one-sided, so to speak: They were full of criticism and 
oftentimes also of a lot of sarcasm. What the president has been 
trying to convey -- that is the need to build a system -- was 
ignored. I also mean the need to establish a strategy not just 
for a year or two, not for the duration of a coalition or two, 
but the kind of measures with which we will enter the new 
century. 
  [Swiac] Mr. Minister, but I hope it is not your intention to 
accuse the mass media of bad faith? 
  [Drzycimski] No, no. 
  [Swiac] So in that case, where is the fundamental error? 
  [Drzycimski] I think it is in that .... [pauses] That is 
quite normal, it is quite a typical phenomenon; I think it 
occurs in every place like Poland where after a period of 
censorship -- which we all know existed before 1989 -- the mass 
media gained enormous freedom. There is an enormous freedom in 
Poland in that regard. But what is missing is what I would 
describe as the responsibility factor. There are more and more 
frequent cases of -- and I am saying that with satisfaction -- 
a sense of being responsible for the country, for what we have 
been doing, and for the fact that Poland's image is also being 
shaped by the mass media.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] In presenting the draft of a new 
copyright law to the Sejm on 18 November, Polish Minister of 
Culture Kazimierz Dejmek argued that the existing 1952 law is 
outdated and that the new law takes into account current 
technologies and economic realities. KRONIKA SEJMOWA of 24 
November reported Dejmek's remarks to the effect that the draft 
contained improvements over the previous version, which he said 
had been revised to make Polish law more compatible with 
European and world standards. This, Dejmak predicted, will make 
participation in international copyright agreements possible and 
"will enable Poland to fulfill obligations resulting from 
previous accords, in particular those resulting from the trade 
treaties with the U.S." 
  Dejmek said, according to the KRONIKA SEJMOWA report, that 
the law was designed to provide equal protection to authors and 
artists, as well as to the producers and distributors of 
cultural products. He also noted that the law delegates 
oversight responsibilities to professional organizations of 
authors, artists, performers, and producers, while at the same 
time exercising control over them by licensing requirements. To 
mitigate the negative impact of the illicit copying of cultural 
products, the law provides that losses due to such pirated 
production will be compensated by fees on blank tapes and 
videocassettes. 
  Zdzislaw Podkanski, a spokesman for one of the parties in 
the 
governing coalition, the Polish Peasant Party (PSL), said that 
the copyright law would bring economic as well as cultural 
benefits. According to Podkanski, the new law both "meets the 
expectations of the artistic associations and satisfies the 
requirements of international pacts and treaties." He also 
endorsed the law's criminal penalties, which he said should 
serve to deter "pirating" of copyrighted materials. 
  Jerzy Zdrada of the opposition Democratic Union described 
the 
existing Polish copyright law as "anachronistic" because it 
"does not reflect the standard legal practice of the European 
Union and the United States." The failure to change the old law 
until now, he charged, has impeded domestic scientific, 
technological, and cultural activities and hampered 
international trade relations. He said that the new law, which 
is based on West European models, should rectify this situation. 
  Speaking for the opposition Confederation for an Independent 
Poland (KPN), Deputy Janusz Koza regretted that the copyright 
law had not been passed earlier because "every day of delay 
causes great losses for the state treasury, businesses, and 
individuals." He complained that, currently, the illegal 
production of tapes, videocassettes, and computer software is 
encouraged by "the impunity of pirates." These pirates, he said, 
penetrate not only the domestic market but also "markets of 
neighboring countries." They pay "neither taxes nor duties" and, 
selling their products at much lower prices, "they ruin 
legitimate businesses."

  [Text] Mikulas Duray and Stefan Pasztor, representatives of 
the Hungarian minority in Slovakia, continue to refuse to 
postpone the Komarno 8 January meeting of deputies and mayors 
who are to debate the possibility of setting up in southern 
Slovakia a region with a special legal status. 
  There is no reason to change anything, Komarno Mayor Stefan 
Pasztor said in an interview with CTK. Problems remain and we 
need a joint stance of a large number of people. At the same 
time he assured that the meeting will be held in accordance with 
the law on petitions. 
  Matica Slovenska [Slovak cultural institution] officials 
yesterday appealed for the meeting in Komarno to be cancelled. 
In their opinion, the meeting endangers the territorial 
integrity of the Slovak Republic. They also demanded that a law 
on the protection of the republic be adopted. 
  Mikulas Duray reckons that it will be not possible to push 
through the demands of the Hungarian minority under the present 
government. However, he considers a Hungarian self-governing 
region, where minority Slovaks would enjoy the same status as do 
the Hungarians within the Slovak majority, on a reciprocal 
basis, to be a realistic long-term objective.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vojtech Bugar, chairman of the Hungarian </F>
Christian Democratic Movement, by Peter Toth; place and date not 
given: "We Do Not Want To Be `Diluted'"] 
  [Text] [Toth] In the Tuesday (28 December 1993) issue of 
SLOVENSKY DENNIK, Arpad Matejka, government commissioner for the 
new territorial and administrative arrangement, said that it was 
impossible to grant collective rights to the Hungarian ethnic 
minority and to establish ethnic borders in Slovakia. How do 
you evaluate his statements? 
  [Bugar] Who is talking here about ethnic borders? Who wants 
to establish ethnic borders? Ethnic borders cannot be 
established in Slovakia, because southern Slovakia is ethnically 
mixed, inhabited by both Slovaks and Hungarians. What we want 
to prevent is a further artificial "dilution" of these areas, so 
that the districts of Dunajska Streda and Komarno are not 
"tagged" as purely Slovak districts. In this way, the higher 
territorial entities would be "diluted" in such a way that the 
Hungarian minority would everywhere constitute fewer than 20 
percent of the population. 
  [Toth] There is no doubt that within the Hungarian minority 
there exists a minority that would welcome ethnic borders. Is 
the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH] prepared to 
eliminate this factor? 
  [Bugar] If such people exist at all, they are only 
individuals. It is not a minority or a group, but only 
individuals who could imagine a different territorial and 
administrative division and, perhaps, also a completely 
different government and, maybe, also a different state. There 
will always be such individuals. What counts, however, is the 
political will of parliamentary parties. What count are the 
intentions of representatives of the Hungarian minority, be they 
politicians or representatives of Csemadok [Hungarian minority's 
cultural organization] or the Union of Hungarian Pedagogues in 
Slovakia. So far, I have not encountered anywhere the intention 
to secede from Slovakia or to create a purely Hungarian region. 
  [Toth] Coexistence Chairman Miklos Duray has said on several 
occasions, between the lines [medzi recou], that his aim was 
territorial autonomy for the Hungarian minority. He is an 
individual, but a leader of your coalition partner.... 
  [Bugar] If Mr. Duray understands as "territorial autonomy" 
the rights that, according to the new territorial and 
administrative division, will fall due to the other regions, 
regardless of whether these regions are Slovak or mixed, 
everything is okay. These are self-administered areas with 
certain powers. But if he understands by this term territorial 
autonomy such as exists in South Tyrol, it is a waste of time to 
speak about it because we know that the political will for this 
is lacking, both on the Slovak side and on the part of various 
European institutions (such as, for example, the Council of 
Europe). The draft principles of the law on the position of 
ethnic minorities, as signed by both the MKDH and Coexistence 
deputies, speaks about transferring jurisdiction over education 
and culture to the regions. If someone speaks about something 
else, it is only his personal view, even if it is Mr. Duray 
himself.

Proposed That the CTV Company Be Granted a License To Operate 
the Second Television Channel"] 
  [Text] Bratislava -- The Slovak Republic Council for Radio 
and Television Broadcasting decided in a secret ballot yesterday 
to propose that the CTV Ltd. Bratislava company be granted a 
license for the STV [Slovak Television] 2 channel. One of CTV's 
representatives is Marcel Dekanovsky, the Kosice movie director. 
  In the course of the preceding weeks, 12 contenders 
presented 
their concepts to obtain 12 hours of broadcasting time on STV 2. 
Slovak Television will continue to operate the channel during 
the remaining hours. The commercial station will broadcast from 
1700 to 0500 hours. Apart from the victorious CTV, whose 
nomination still must be approved by parliament, the license had 
also been sought by the following firms: Redstone, Davay, Sola, 
Sezam TV, SP, Artep, Markiza, Danube Television Channel, Medium 
5, Sitno 5, and Cent Eur (behind which stands U.S. the capital 
of Turner BS, which owns, among other things, the Cable News 
Network). 
  In a secret ballot, CTV won five votes from members of the 
Council, Cent Eur won three votes, and Sitno 5 won one vote.

Foreign Affairs"] 
  [Text] Bratislava -- SME approached the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs Press Department in conjunction with reports in 
the daily press about a "list of some 100 Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs staffers who are to leave the Ministry in January being 
prepared" and about "the closure of several Slovak embassies 
abroad." We were told that no such list exists at the Ministry. 
In response to our question about how many foreign missions 
would be closed, and for what reasons, the press department 
stated that "in view of the volume of financial resources 
allocated to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak 
Republic from the state budget for 1994, the Ministry had to 
draw up a set of cost-cutting measures, within the framework of 
which it is considering the closure of some foreign missions as 
well as staff reductions at foreign missions." It promised "to 
inform the mass media once the proposed measures have been 
approved by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or by the 
government." As Minister Jozef Moravcik recently promised that 
the posts of ambassadors to the United States, Germany, and 
Hungary would be filled by the end of the year, we inquired 
about their appointment. We learned that "Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Jozef Moravcik submitted to a Slovak Government meeting 
proposals for the appointment of ambassadors to the three 
countries. So far, the government has approved Branislav 
Lichardus as ambassador of the Slovak Republic to the United 
States and the president of the republic has signed his 
nomination. He has received an agreement from the U.S. side and 
will take up his post shortly," the reply of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs Press Department states in conclusion.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The emergence of right-wing nationalism 
in the recent Russian elections was the main concern expressed 
by Milos Zeman, head of the Czech Social Democratic Party, in an 
interview published after a recent conference of social 
democratic parties. Zeman, in his 20 December interview in the 
right-of-center Prague daily CESKY DENIK, said that the 
social-democratic parties of Central Europe must develop a 
strategy to counter the danger presented by the emergence of 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to political power in Russia because "Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy belongs to the extreme Right, the extreme Right is 
extremely nationalistic, and this nationalism, combined with 
expansionist ambitions, presents a clear threat to the region of 
Central Europe." The conference, which took place in Bratislava 
on 18-19 December, was the first meeting of the seven social 
democratic parties of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and 
Poland. 
  Asked by CESKY DENIK reporter Petruska Sustrova whether it 
did not bother him that "at least two of your partners are 
parties directly descended from communist parties," Zeman said 
he had to respect the results of elections and pointed out that 
the parties in question enjoyed rather high voter support. In 
fact, he said, "One of them, in Poland, was so high that it won 
the elections." 
  Zeman said that the Bratislava meeting was also attended by 
representatives of the German, Swedish, and Austrian social 
democratic parties, and that the formulation of strategy by the 
Central European parties "must naturally be conducted in close 
coordination with the West European social democrats." 
  Voicing the hope that the social democrats would win the 
coming West German elections, Zeman revealed that "we are 
holding a two-day get-together with SPD [Social Democratic Party 
of Germany] Chairman [Rudolf] Sharping in March." He expressed 
the hope that cooperation among the region's social democrats 
"could lead to a social democratic Central Europe in a few 
years." As an example of socialist resurgence, Zeman noted that 
the Hungarian Socialist Party has taken the lead in the latest 
public opinion polls, with elections scheduled for next May.

  [Text] General Jean Cot, who was the guest of our 1300 
bulletin, live from Zagreb, denounced the humiliations inflicted 
upon the Blue Helmet UN soldiers on the ground. The UN 
Protection Forces commander in chief also said that his troops 
are ready for a potential offensive intervention, should the 
United Nations give the green light, of course: 
  [Begin Cot recording] My freedom of action is more 
restricted 
than I would like; this will come as no surprise to you, because 
I am not here to wage a war, for instance. 
  I think, however, that we can do two things. First, we 
should be firmer in our attitude toward the Bosnian Serbs in 
particular, since they are the ones who are hampering our 
freedom of action most at the moment. I was able to verify this 
during the long week I spent there. Also -- and this is the 
message I am striving to put across -- we should exert pressure 
in Geneva, including on our negotiators. 
  To me, it seems impossible that, on the one hand, we should 
behave like nice mediators and have polite conversations with 
the political and military officials of former Yugoslavia while, 
on the other hand, our force on the ground is being subjected to 
increasing pressure and even humiliation. Therefore, I cannot 
emphasize enough to Geneva -- and I would also like to put this 
message across to New York -- that we must probably put the 
brakes on, and we cannot be nice in Geneva while we suffer on 
the ground. 
  We retaliate every time our rules allow us to do so, that is 
to say, every time we face a direct attack, believe me. As a 
result, we do not suffer. You will, however, understand that 
when the lives of some 3 million men and women in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are at stake, we have to swallow our pride, 
which is sometimes difficult. However, I do not think we should 
swallow our honor. Where do you draw the line between both, 
where is the threshold? I will decide. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report on news conference held on 15 December </F>
by Jozsef Kasza, mayor of Subotica: "To Weather the Misery"] 
  [Text] At a news conference held yesterday, Mayor Jozsef 
Kasza reacted to charges leveled by the SPS [Socialist Party of 
Serbia] Szabadka [Subotica] organization at Tuesday's news 
conference. As reported in detail by this newspaper, the grave 
charges related primarily to the social policy of the local 
government; the soup kitchen opened last Monday was viewed as 
humiliating from the standpoint of citizens, and as a political 
move whose timing coincides with the elections. 
  "Despite the difficult situation and the grave shortage of 
money, the local government is taking every possible action to 
provide for the poorest stratum of the city's residents, to 
enable these people to weather the cold and the misery. The 
fundamental void in the charges leveled by the gentlemen from 
the SPS is that they forget to mention the fact that they were 
the ones who brought this situation upon the citizens, the same 
people who are now in power in the republic, and whose policies 
cast the country into total isolation, and its citizens into 
total misery," Jozsef Kasza said relative to the charges that 
"exceed anything we have heard so far." "I agree with the 
assertion that a soup kitchen is degrading, particularly in this 
part of Vojvodina, one of the richest agricultural areas of 
Serbia, where extremely diligent people live, people who could 
earn a livelihood as a result of their work. But inappropriate 
policies have brought these people to a point where they cannot 
afford to buy a loaf of bread, or a single warm meal per day. 
The SPS does not support our humanitarian action program, 
despite the fact that they have been hauling food away from here 
to other parts of the country for years. We are aware of the 
identity of those who carried relief supply shipments to every 
part of the former Yugoslavia; they took aid collected in 
Szabadka to the battle fields, or the shipments ended up on the 
black market. At this point it is the local government's 
function to rescue citizens lingering below the subsistence 
level. By using funds from our tight budget, and from 
humanitarian aid received, we are trying to help these people 
irrespective of their nationality, religion, or political 
belonging. At this point, those who plundered the northern 
Bacska region have tried to undermine the launching of a soup 
kitchen program. They cannot succeed in this effort, however, 
because the people of Szabadka are prepared to cook on hot 
plates to save their fellow citizens from hunger," according to 
the Szabadka mayor. The mayor expressed regrets over the fact 
that the SPS, while increasingly losing ground, creates 
political issues out of social welfare concerns, and in the 
course of this, it uses the customary method of telling lies. 
Jozsef Kasza denied that the SPS members of the municipal 
committee in charge of organizing supplies for the populace were 
not invited to participate in the committee's work. Compliance 
with the most recent government decree is delayed because the 
ministry having jurisdiction has failed to dispatch all the the 
vouchers, despite repeated interventions. Citizens did not 
receive their laundry detergent for September because the local 
government had neither funds nor fuel to transport the detergent 
from Krusevac to Szabadka. Transportation charges for bringing 
the per capita rations to Szabadka frequently exceeded the worth 
of goods to be transported. 
  Jozsef Kasza expressed regrets over the fact that a noted 
professional, Dr. Rodoljub Duric, the director of the Szabadka 
hospital, also joined the SPS's campaign, which is filled with 
lies and is aimed at discrediting the local government. Managing 
the hospital would be his primary function, but "he should, at 
least, be honest as long as he entered into political 
discourse," because the local government supports the hospital 
by using municipal reserve funds. The mayor of Szabadka says 
that it is not true that Dusan Stipanovic successfully lobbied 
for the opening of a border crossing point at Bajmok-Bacsalmas; 
the truth is that Stipanovic raised obstacles in the path of 
opening the crossing point. Similarly, the truth is that Jozsef 
Kasza negotiated with Foreign Minister Jovanovic and with the 
appropriate Hungarian organizations regarding extended work 
hours. Construction of facilities at the border crossing point 
is also impeded by people from Bajmok encouraged by the SPS; 
construction could begin upon release of the disputed area. On 
the other hand, contrary to to experience of residents of other 
municipalities, Szabadka residents are unable to obtain 
passports for months. This could not occur if Interior Ministry 
organs performed their functions and provided passports 
continuously. Every citizen has a right to receive passports. 
  "The Szabadka local government wants peace, and tries to 
conduct its affairs despite the difficult circumstances that it 
experiences by no fault of its own," Mayor Jozsef Kasza said in 
conclusion of yesterday's news conference.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Milan Kucan by Miha Dj. Stamcar </F>
and Jani Sever; place and date not given: "Every Story Must End 
Sometime"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Arms </H5>
  [MLADINA] Following Slovenia's independence a war broke out 
in Croatia and Bosnia, and Slovenia helped these two countries 
with arms, too. Decisions were allegedly made at the sessions 
of the Defense Council. What did you discuss at these sessions? 
  [Kucan] In the presidency and at the Defense Council 
sessions we actually debated arms within three groups. First, 
the seizure and purchase of arms for Slovene requirements. At 
that time Slovenia had to prepare itself even for the most 
extreme possible outcome. However, the presidency had nothing 
to do with the purchase of arms. This was the responsibility of 
the government. 
  Second, we discussed arms when Croatia was attacked. Even 
before the war in Slovenia, [Defense and Interior] Ministers 
Jansa and Bavcar at the meeting with their Croatian counterparts 
wanted to sign a military alliance pact with the Croats. This 
would have involved us deeper into the Croatian war and Dr. Plut 
and Dr. Kmecl [presidency members] were both opposed to this. 
When the war in Croatia started, the defense minister's 
position was adopted that to assist Croatia was the best defense 
of Slovenia. We all agreed with it. We also agreed with the 
stance that Croatia should be helped with equipment and arms 
held by Slovenia to the extent to which this aid would not 
endanger Slovenia's defense capability. 
  When the war spread to Bosnia-Herzegovina, we decided to 
help 
Bosnia-Herzegovina with the same arguments and on the basis of 
similar standpoints. Therefore, assistance yes, but on the 
condition that the defense capability of Slovenia is not 
endangered. Bearing in mind that at that time the situation in 
Bosnia, which was not ready for the war, grew very strained, the 
agreement to facilitate transport to Bosnia via Slovenia was 
understandable. 
  The last time we discussed this was this January, when prior 
to the formation of the new government Igor Bavcar, interior 
minister at that time, briefly assessed the circumstances. He 
said there were certain indications that an illegal arms trade 
was going on via Slovenia that could not be controlled. A 
debate then ensued whether to continue helping Bosnia as a 
state, although it had practically disintegrated into three 
parts, fighting among themselves. We adopted a position that 
all forms of assistance with the exception of humanitarian aid 
be stopped. 
  [MLADINA] From a distance it appears that matters became 
complicated over the minutes of the Defense Council sessions, 
which your office would not forward to the Defense Ministry, and 
as a result of which for over six months the ministry would not 
answer questions concerning arms from 27 deputies. The Defense 
Ministry claims that on the basis of these minutes a line could 
be drawn between state arms trade and illegal arms trade, in 
which state officials were involved, and which the Airport 
affair was all about. Why do you not simply send these minutes 
to the Defense Ministry? 
  [Kucan] Of course, a little more honesty on the part of the 
ministry would help the whole matter. All minutes and all 
materials are stored and accessible to the authorized persons of 
the Defense Ministry. A claim that the documents are not 
available to the Defense Ministry and that the latter, 
therefore, cannot prepare an answer for the State Chamber, does 
not correspond to the truth. 
  [MLADINA] The difference is perhaps between being able to 
see documents and studying them for some time. 
  [Kucan] I do not know why reading minutes in the Defense 
Ministry would be any different from reading them in Erjavceva 
[location of president's office]. The minutes are simply 
minutes. Each institution has a duty to protect its archives. 
There is no obstacle to prevent the documents being available 
to the people from the ministry for as long as they need them. 
When, for example, the criminal service of the Interior 
Ministry requested to see documentation in connection with the 
investigation of the Maribor airport arms affair, this was 
always available and the ministry's representatives never 
demanded to take it away. However, when the investigating judge 
requested these documents according to official procedure, the 
office acted the way it was obliged to according to the criminal 
procedure law. All this is, therefore, sheer manipulation with 
the public. The documents are available to the ministry. 
However, another question is whether the ministry really wants 
to study these documents in connection with the report for the 
State Chamber. I also consulted the members of the presidency 
about taking documents out of the office's archive, especially 
in light of the increasingly widespread practice of misusing 
highly classified documents, whose first victim was presidency 
member Ciril Zlobec. Namely, all these minutes date from the 
time of the presidency's mandate. All members agreed that the 
documents should stay in the house. 
  [MLADINA] Could one on the basis of these minutes really 
draw a line between the arms trade with and without the 
government's blessing? 
  [Kucan] One can conclude from these minutes that a political 
position was adopted that Croatia and Bosnia should be assisted 
with equipment as well as arms that Slovenia had at its 
disposal. One can also ascertain that a political decision that 
Slovenia would purchase arms for anyone else and then sell them 
was never made. One can determine who were the people in the 
Defense Ministry that the Bosnia-Herzegovina representatives 
should turn to regarding this. 
  [MLADINA] Also the representatives of Croatia? 
  [Kucan] For Croatia this was not envisaged as there were no 
such problems. Because of the circumstances that emerged in 
Bosnia, many people presenting themselves as plenipotentiaries 
of the government or of various ministries were appearing in 
Slovenia. This caused uncertainty in the Interior Ministry and 
the Defense Ministry. Both ministries wanted the matters 
concerning Bosnia to be clarified. 
<H5>  Meeting with Izetbegovic </H5>
  [MLADINA] The meeting of the Bosnian and the Slovene 
delegations in Brdo in the summer of 1992 was also connected to 
the aid to Bosnia. On that occasion you met with Izetbegovic. 
What did you discuss? 
  [Kucan] This was happening when the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina was in its initial, extreme phase. Just as 
we were looking for support abroad -- moral and other -- during 
the war in Slovenia, the Bosnians were also seeking help. In 
this way separate meetings of the government delegations and a 
meeting with President Izetbegovic took place in Brdo. The 
minutes of it exist. Beside myself, Mr. Ivan Oman, Assembly 
Vice President Vane Gosnik, Mr. Peter Tos from the Interior 
Ministry, my foreign affairs' adviser Ida Mocivnik, and Marjan 
Siftar, the chief of my cabinet at that time, also attended the 
talks that were requested by Izetbegovic. We primarily spoke 
about the general situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and whether 
Slovenia could put in a good word for Bosnia-Herzegovina at the 
diplomatic level and secure aid to this country. 
  [MLADINA] Did you use the term arms? 
  [Kucan] Of course. Izetbegovic primarily spoke about this, 
saying, if I remember correctly, that the greatest problem was 
shortage of ammunition. We have repeated our political stance 
that we would assist as much as we could but that we could not 
trade in arms for them, which he did not want anyway. We have 
facilitated the shipments for Bosnia to travel through our 
country, but we told Izetbegovic separately we hoped that he 
would not misuse humanitarian cargoes for the shipment of arms, 
because by this he would compromise us, himself, humanitarian 
aid, and humanitarian organizations. 
  [MLADINA] How did you agree as to who will take care of 
that? 
  [Kucan] Concrete decisions were the task of the government, 
that is to say, the Defense Ministry and the Interior Ministry. 
Minister Jansa appointed Mr. Lovsin as a contact person. How 
the things went from there on I do not know. The presidency has 
never received a report about this. 
<H5>  Meeting With Cengic </H5>
  [MLADINA] It is normal for presidents of two countries to 
meet and discuss matters, but your meeting with Hasan Cengic is 
much more obscure. 
  [Kucan] As I have already said, it was not only Hasan Cengic 
who turned to me, but numerous other people who claimed that 
they were Bosnia-Herzegovina plenipotentiaries, bringing 
messages from President Izetbegovic about the situation in 
Bosnia and about whether we could intensify international 
diplomatic activity to end the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Among 
others, Fikret Abdic, who was at that time a member of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, also came to visit me in this 
role. Because there were several of these people, we demanded, 
as I have already said, that they appoint an authorized 
representative to Slovenia, and Izetbegovic's answer to that was 
that Hasan Cengic was the man. 
  [MLADINA] Some believe that a man becomes a plenipotentiary 
only when a country in which he is supposed to work has 
acknowledged his credentials. Has Slovenia acknowledged the 
status of plenipotentiary to any of the Bosnian representatives 
who came here? 
  [Kucan] I informed the incumbent ministers that the Bosnians 
proposed Hasan Cengic as the plenipotentiary. Whether he had 
formal authority and whether he presented this to those in the 
Defense and Interior Ministries with whom he discussed concrete 
aid, I do not know. I myself did not demand this from him. I 
have held talks with him twice. I told him to turn to Mr. 
Lovsin, whom the [defense] minister had appointed as a contact 
person. However, concerning the arms' affair in Maribor, we 
have now received documents from Bosnia in which prime minister, 
the defense ministry, and the president say that the Slovene 
authorities knew that Cengic was the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
plenipotentiary. To my knowledge, there are three documents 
that officially confirm the identity of Hasan Cengic. 
  [MLADINA] You have said that three various Slovene state 
organs have received documents confirming that Hasan Cengic was 
Bosnia-Herzegovina plenipotentiary, however, the defense 
minister maintains that Cengic was not authorized. Did the 
minister see these three documents? 
  [Kucan] One was definitely addressed to the Defense Ministry 
via the Interior Ministry. I myself received it from there. 
  Also, if they cooperated with Cengic earlier, that is to 
say, 
before the discovery of the arms, without asking him for his 
authority, this means that they actually treated him as a 
plenipotentiary. A document addressed to the Defense Minister, 
referring to the meeting in September 1992, provides sufficient 
illustration. Everything now is just a sheer pretense. 
  [MLADINA] You spoke of the meeting with Izetbegovic at which 
you also discussed the arms assistance. There is a UN arms 
embargo, however. You did not think that this could have had 
consequences for Slovenia. 
  [Kucan] I remember how it was when we were attacked and how 
frantically we needed and sought help. Also, how grateful I was 
and will be to [former German Foreign] Minister Genscher for the 
meeting in Villach and his immediate action, with which he 
mobilized his colleagues in the European Community to intercede 
to end the attack on Slovenia. This was my stance when the 
question arose as to whether we would help Croatia and later 
Bosnia. The embargo that was passed for the territory of the 
whole of Yugoslavia was particularly unfair toward the Muslims, 
because the Serbs nevertheless had contact with their hinterland 
-- Serbia, they were getting arms from there, the Croats 
similarly, although with greater difficulty, from Croatia, while 
the Muslims could not get arms from anybody. I have spoken with 
numerous people in the world and most of them openly agreed that 
the arms embargo was unfair. Although I do not advocate war, I 
know what it means to be attacked in a war and not have arms. 
If I had to decide on it again, I would make the same decision 
to assist. Much more than this aid, the world holds against us 
the fact that we are now so passive toward the war in Bosnia, as 
if this does not concern us even though the war is raging so 
close. 
  [MLADINA] You, therefore, think that Slovenia is not active 
enough in its attempts to resolve the crisis? 
  [Kucan] I do not think that we are the ones who can offer a 
solution, however, I am not one of those who say that the 
slightest involvement in this issue would drag us back into the 
Balkans, of which we neither are nor wish to be a part. We 
definitely have as many reasons for cooperation in finding a 
solution for the Bosnian crisis as other European countries that 
are further away from the crisis, and also the same share of 
responsibility. 
<H5>  Supervised President </H5>
  [MLADINA] Before the Airport affair, you met with Miro 
Predanic, agent of the Security Information Service, and later 
with Vinko Beznik, chief of the Slovene special police troops. 
How did you come meet with them and how did the Defense 
Ministry find out about it? 
  [Kucan] In the interview for your weekly, Miro Predanic has 
explained already the content of our talks. He had second 
thoughts, though, about talking to me in my office. Because he 
was high in the hierarchy of the Security Information Service, 
he probably knew why. For me this was a sufficiently clear 
warning. 
  I met with Mr. Beznik at my request. We discussed the 
confusion surrounding his decoration. At the proposal of 
Minister Bavcar, and with the agreement of his successor, 
Minister Bizjak, Mr. Vinko Beznik was awarded with a decoration. 
However, he was not supposed to receive it for the same reasons 
for which Mr. Tone Krkovic [head of special brigade Moris] had 
returned his decoration [sentence as published]. He explained 
that this was not the case. Subsequently, I read in the paper 
that Mr. Beznik was with me and how much time he spent with me. 
It is, of course, no secret who visits the president. However, 
it is interesting to note that somebody is supervising and even 
keeping a log of how many minutes the talks and visits last. I 
cannot imagine who would have the authority to do this. 
  [MLADINA] If this means supervision, it is obviously 
analytically supported. Do you suspect any secret service? 
  [Kucan] I do not know whether secret services are involved, 
however, they definitely do not have the authorization for such 
a thing. For this reason, in light of the notorious letter by 
the Civilian Initiative, I have demanded from the incumbent 
organs that they ascertain whether the statements contained in 
this anonymous letter are correct. Also, whether an organized 
group of people exists in the Slovenia that is gathering 
information about the functioning of the state organs, 
individual offices, and individual citizens without 
authorization. I am firmly convinced that a document like the 
two anonymous letters [both by the Civilian Initiative] cannot 
be written by one man alone, who would lack a database that can 
be compiled only in an organized fashion. Who in the country is 
in charge of this is known, although I believe that too many 
institutions in Slovenia are responsible for keeping records of 
personal data, and I am not referring merely to the intelligence 
and security services. 
<H5>  Presidential Visits </H5>
  [MLADINA] Some politicians, not so much Jansa's circle but 
more Peterle's circle, sport the theory that Slovenia, with a 
president who is a member of the former [Communist] party, finds 
it much more difficult to find partners abroad than it would 
have had with somebody without such a past. 
  [Kucan] I would say that with imprudent partners Slovenia 
will find it difficult to assert itself in the world of 
intelligent partners. Today's world is no longer a world of 
ideologies, but a world of knowledge, arguments, pragmatism, and 
democracy. Contrary to some domestic politicians, the world 
recognizes the outcome of the democratic elections. I would 
also like to say, not without a reason, that I even get too many 
invitations. The problem is that we have no planned priorities 
as to how we should carry out these visits and what Slovenia can 
expect from them. 
  [MLADINA] What sort of priority are you referring to? 
  [Kucan] Priority in the spheres of interest of Slovenia's 
foreign policy. I agree with a commentary that I have read that 
my visit to Albania was a lost opportunity. I have asked the 
government for an opinion on the usefulness of this visit and 
about who should accompany me. After this visit I see the 
Slovene possibilities primarily in economic cooperation with 
Albania. Albania expects this, too. At the beginning of next 
year we plan to hold a meeting of a mixed Slovene-Albanian 
economic commission, which will review the implementation of the 
interstate economic cooperation agreement. There are, of 
course, other decisions, too, for example, how great is our 
interest in cooperation with Turkey, Israel, Russia, and so 
forth. 
  [MLADINA] For the time being we have opted for the Czech 
Republic and ultimately we are supposed to form a customs union 
with it? 
  [Kucan] I believe that this is very important for Slovenia. 
I have also received an invitation from the Czech Republic to 
attend the spring meeting of all presidents of the Central 
European states -- Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, 
Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Slovenia. 
  [MLADINA] Whom will you take with you? 
  [Kucan] As usual, I will consult the government about this. 
  [MLADINA] The British Prime Minister Major invited 
successful English managers with him on his trip to India, where 
they were met by local people of similar standing. 
  [Kucan] When I travel where I was invited I will certainly 
try to open doors for Slovene companies or support them in their 
business pursuits. When Czech Prime Minister Mr. Klaus was 
visiting, I introduced him at the dinner to the directors of the 
Slovene companies that trade most with the Czech Republic and 
gave him the opportunity to have talks with them. 

<H5>    "Wild" Privatization </H5>
  [MLADINA] Privatization has started in Slovenia and numerous 
directors are accused of being red directors, that is to say, 
Udbomafia people [connected to the former State Security 
Service]. What are your ideas about the property reform? 
  [Kucan] To become the owner of social property in a company 
is primarily the right of those who have managed it carefully 
for decades, enlarged it, and sacrificed higher salaries for the 
sake of investments, technological development, the conquest of 
markets, the raising of ecological awareness, and training. 
Regardless of the fact that social justice must be taken into 
account, we must primarily strive to establish a situation that 
will allow as much economic effectiveness as possible in the 
implementation of the law. This is the basic goal of property 
transformation. 
  However, if irregularities and abuses occur in this process, 
that is to say, during the implementation of this law, then such 
wrongdoings must first be proven and perpetrators subsequently 
punished. It is the juridical organs and the prosecutor that 
are responsible for this. Indiscriminate screaming about theft 
contributes neither toward the effectiveness of the property 
transformation process, nor to supervision and prevention of 
anomalies, and above all, not toward legal security, which is 
necessary for effective management. I would rather say that 
such behavior helps to create unstable circumstances that would 
suit the restructuring of the legitimate political power in 
Slovenia and the creation of a front behind which lawlessness 
could continue. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Kucan's People </H5>
  [MLADINA] Do you have a lobby? 
  [Kucan] It has become very popular to speak about lobbies 
recently. Not a single modern country functions without what is 
in Slovenia now understood as a lobby, however, I do not myself 
have a lobby. 
  Disregarding this, in every society an informal system of 
acquaintances and connections exists that is based on mutual 
trust and life experience. Actually, the only question is 
whether the lobby system functions within the legal framework or 
whether these acquaintances are being misused for illegal 
activities. It would be good for Slovenia if we passed a law on 
lobbying. 
  [MLADINA] Good. You do not have a lobby. So who are 
"Kucan's people" then? At the end of the day, papers often also 
publish names, and your men, who appear in the affairs 
surrounding Safti, Smelt, and others, could simply be enumerated. 
  [Kucan] Following this logic numerous former and current 
directors would be in my lobby, had I had one. Throughout the 
years of my political activity I have met with and consulted 
many of them. For example, about how the political situation in 
Yugoslavia will develop and such matters that were important for 
their development and business decisions. Quite a few of those 
who, following this criteria, would be in my lobby are now in 
other lobbies where they get much more useful and authentic 
information about economic, financial, and also other issues, as 
well as concrete party support. This does not seem unusual to 
me. They cannot get this support from me. As regards the names 
that you have mentioned, I would like to say that I only know 
Mr. Cupin from Safti from my youth, when he was one of the 
leading activists in the Slovene Youth Initiative in Trieste. I 
have nothing to do with his business in Safti, regardless of the 
latest affair and even allegations that I am Safti's owner. 
  [MLADINA] Did you ever meet with Igor Bavcar in Vodnikova 
133, the headquarters of Adit, whose owner was also Safti? 
Namely, Adit director Mr. Platovsek told the agents of the 
military intelligence service so. 
  [Kucan] No, I did not know where this house was at all and 
when I found out, I remembered that I passed it when I was still 
living in Sisenska Street, when I went to Mostec with the 
children. At that time there was a dunghill in front of that 
house; it was a farm. The dunghill is gone but it obviously 
still stinks there. 
  [MLADINA] What about all these statements of Platovsek? 
  [Kucan] I do not know what Mr. Platovsek said to the agents 
of the VOMO [Military intelligence service]. What I have read 
of what he said about me and Safti has no real basis of truth 
whatsoever. I did not meet anyone and I did not forward 
information to anyone. However, in connection with this I am 
concerned that Mr. Platovsek said nothing about this to the 
investigating judge, the criminal police, or the prosecutor, as 
I deduce from the newspaper articles, but precisely to the 
military intelligence service. This service is not responsible 
for the disclosure of such actions as Mr. Platovsek speaks of. 
If I am to believe the newspapers, once this service had 
established what criminal activities Mr. Platovsek suspected 
Safti of, they did not immediately call the police. 
  [MLADINA] Do you believe that this service is not properly 
supervised? 
  [Kucan] In general I believe that the security-intelligence 
and counterintelligence services need to be supervised and 
directed by an authorized organ, in which the state's security 
concept or the state's protection policy, as determined by the 
parliament, should be embodied. This organ would at the same 
time direct the work of these services and supervise them. It 
cannot be left to the discretion of these services whether they 
will inform anyone about important security and intelligence 
information and whom they will inform if at all. Their duties 
must be clearly determined by the law or on the basis of the 
law, otherwise temptation will arise sooner or later and they 
will be abused. It was only the presidency of the republic that 
proposed the formation of a national security council during the 
constitutional debate. [passage omitted] 

<H5>    Electoral Promises </H5>
  [MLADINA] You were elected president a year ago. From what 
you promised the voters what did you in your opinion deliver? 
  [Kucan] I do not have great problems regarding this. My 
slogan was: The work is not finished yet. The process of 
political and economic reforms in Slovenia and the process of 
Slovenia's integration in a modern society of peoples and 
nations are not yet completed. The social policy and transition 
into a post-industrial society are the components of this. I 
believe that bearing in mind the circumstances, especially the 
social situation, unemployment, and the uncertain future for the 
young people, I would nowadays have an even stronger reason for 
choosing the slogan I chose then. 
  [MLADINA] It was not an electoral promise, but the coalition 
of the Liberal Democratic Party, the Slovene Christian 
Democrats, and the United List was also one of your ideas. What 
do you think of this coalition now and would you again advocate 
such a coalition? 
  [Kucan] It is true that I favored such a coalition precisely 
because of the recognition that the work was not yet over and 
that we were entering a very demanding phase of the state's 
regulation and its integration in the international sphere. I 
was convinced that this would be much easier if the 
responsibility for this were assumed by the three largest 
political parties chosen at the elections and if they accepted 
this as their principal goal. 
  [MLADINA] Did you have privatization in mind and the fact 
that these three parties will also get the biggest piece of the 
privatization cake? 
  [Kucan] No, but that they would, within the context I speak 
of, assume responsibility for the formation of a concept and 
take care of the legality of the property transformation 
process. Therefore, that they would invest their efforts for 
Slovenia and not primarily for their party interests, which are 
otherwise perfectly legitimate. The coalition is functioning as 
it is, that is to say, differently from what I expected. And 
since you ask me whether I would favor such a coalition again, 
my answer to you is yes, on the basis of the initial positions I 
spoke of, and no, on the basis of current practice. 
  [MLADINA] And why not in practice? 
  [Kucan] You see yourself how the coalition functions. 
  [MLADINA] Did you hear that the cabinet looked completely 
different 15 minutes prior to its proclamation, that is to say, 
that a different defense minister was on the list? 
  [Kucan] They asked me for my opinion and I answered that I 
advise the present minister. Whether this was decisive or not, 
I do not know. 
  [MLADINA] Would you now change your mind and decide 
differently. 
  [Kucan] Yes. 
  [MLADINA] Will you run for president again? 
  [Kucan] No. 
  [MLADINA] Why not? 
  [Kucan] Every story must end sometime.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman by </F>
correspondents Mirjana Rakic, Denis Latin, and Darko Herceg in 
Zagreb; correspondents not individually identified -- live] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Mr. President, let us begin with the 
world. What is the greatest achievement of Croatia's foreign 
policy in 1994 [as heard]? 
  [Tudjman] I think that we could agree that the passing of UN 
Security Council Resolution 871 -- which contains all previous 
resolutions and whereby the UN's most authoritative body 
confirmed as never before Croatia's territorial integrity and 
its right to Croatian territory under the protection of the 
peacekeeping forces, and directly linked the solving of the 
crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the sanctions against Serbia, 
which caused everything that is going on in the UN protected 
areas and Bosnia, and the solving of the crisis not only in 
Bosnia, but also in Croatia. It seems to me that this is the 
most important event in the sphere of foreign policy. 
  In internal affairs, I think that we could agree that the 
most important event was the Maslenica operation with which we 
linked northern Croatia with Dalmatian Croatia, as well as the 
latest successes of the Croatian Government in curbing inflation. 
  [Correspondent] These were the achievements. However, what 
have we not managed to do in 1994 [as heard], primarily in our 
contacts with the world? 
  [Tudjman] Obviously, we have not managed to solve our main 
problem -- that is, the problem of the territories that are 
under occupation -- to integrate the Croatian areas into 
Croatia's constitutional and legal system. Of course, we have 
not managed to do that because of the overall international 
situation; due to the crisis in the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia, the war in Bosnia, and the current circumstances in 
the world. 
  [Correspondent] Speaking about the world and conditions on 
the international scene, hasn't the international community 
shown a lack of understanding? 
  [Tudjman] The international community has shown not only a 
lack of understanding, but also disunity. Europe does not know 
what to do with the crisis in the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia and the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The world does 
not know either, including the main world power -- the United 
States. We could say that they mishandled this hot chestnut of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is objectively a very complex issue. 
But it is still surprising to see how disunited Europe and the 
United Nations, and the United States, were, and with how much 
disunity and unresourcefulness they tackled the problem of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Therefore, that is the reason why we have to this day found 
no solution, and this is why we are still uncertain as to who 
will say the final world in solving the crisis. 
  [Correspondent] From the point of view of the international 
community in general, Bosnia-Herzegovina is the main problem and 
especially Croatia's attitude to this neighboring state. Our 
attitude to Bosnia-Herzegovina has changed during the war and, 
in general, as time passed. Mr. President, what are the 
relations between Zagreb and Sarajevo at present? 
  [Tudjman] I would not say that our attitude to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has been changing. Right from the beginning 
we advocated the preservation of a single Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
However, we were aware of the fact that Bosnia-Herzegovina 
could not survive as a unitary state. If Yugoslavia could not 
survive in the period of the collapse of not only socialism but 
also multinational state creations, it is obvious that a single 
Bosnia had no chance of survival -- a Bosnia in which 
differences are even greater than those in former Yugoslavia. 
Our policy has been consistent. We favored the preservation of 
Bosnia. We advised Croats there to take part in the referendum 
on Bosnia's independence. We were willing to accept the 
cantonal, confederal organization that was proposed by 
Ambassador Cutilheiro. We were also willing to accept a 
division of Bosnia into provinces, i.e. the Vance-Owen plan, and 
finally a proposal on the union of Bosnia-Herzegovina republics, 
hoping to develop cooperation with the Muslims. We exerted 
special efforts by signing agreements -- the ones known to the 
public and even those yet to be revealed when the right time 
comes. 
  Izetbegovic's leadership in Bosnia-Herzegovina has given 
consent to these agreements, but Sarajevo, its Muslim 
leadership, has continued with the policy of the continuation of 
the war against the Croats and for the conquest of those areas 
envisaged, for instance the Croat-majority province that later 
became the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. Unable to recapture 
the areas they lost in the Serbian aggression, they wanted to 
take the Croat territories and they are now even threatening the 
Croatian enclaves in central Bosnia. This is where the problem 
lies. For our part, we tried to involve the Turkish Government 
in influencing Muslim policy. None of this has had any result 
so far, and for us it is a sensitive issue: Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are threatened by a Muslim offensive, even 
genocide, while we in Croatia are looking after hundreds of 
thousands of Muslims, among others. We have to exert special 
efforts to make our people understand this, and we shall 
continue to do everything in our power to achieve friendship 
with the Muslims for the sake of the future and for the sake of 
joint strategic interests. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, a short while ago you said 
that the greatest task we have not managed to perform is the 
full integration of all parts of Croatian territory. It is 
evident to everyone that this is a very complicated process 
which will probably continue. Tell us about the results of your 
policy. Should one have perhaps have opted for some other 
policy, either a more radical policy or a softer one? 
  [Tudjman] Understandably, whenever any kind of problem is at 
issue there are various attitudes and differing views. I 
believe that, if our past experience is anything to go by, we 
can conclude -- this will be certainly confirmed from a 
historical perspective -- that we have been pursuing the sole 
effective policy, the only purposeful policy. Despite the 
unfavorable circumstances surrounding the creation of an 
independent and democratic Croatia, we have nevertheless managed 
to create an independent, democratic, and sovereign Croatia. We 
managed to resist Serbian aggression at a time when this Serbia 
and its greater Serbian programs had the entire armed forces of 
the Yugoslav communist army at its disposal. 
  You know, since you raised this question, I have read in our 
newspapers about views to the effect that a more resolute plan 
should have been applied in tackling this Serbian aggression led 
by the Yugoslav Army. I have recently come across a book by 
General Kadijevic, the [former] Yugoslav secretary of national 
defense, who openly reveals that the Yugoslav Army, that 
Belgrade planned to conquer at all costs both Zagreb and 
Varazdin while waiting for an excuse. They needed a pretext. 
Consequently, this policy of ours, this policy of negotiations 
-- while simultaneously creating our police and military forces 
out of nothing, and of accepting internationalisation, i.e. the 
Vance plan -- was the only viable one. In this way we prevented 
Croatia from being completely destroyed. 
  We reconciled ourselves, temporarily, to having one fourth 
of 
Croatian territory -- at that time it was one third of Croatian 
territory -- placed under the peace force's protection although 
our adversary was also dutybound to agree to have these 
paramilitary Serbian formations disarmed and to the 
incorporation of these areas into Croatia's constitutional 
system. This was not done because this disunited world 
tolerated the Serbian aggression. In this world there are very 
influential, responsible factors, not only factors but forces, 
too, which did not want to see an independent Croatia, which, 
toward the end of 1991, even desired Croatia's defeat in the war. 
  Therefore, in those circumstances we could not have achieved 
more than we did. We obtained Croatia's international 
recognition and the international community's consent -- in the 
form of the most authoritative resolutions, as I said in answer 
to the first question -- that at any cost all areas currently 
held by Serbia are part of Croatia's territorial integrity, and 
that a solution should be found for them to be integrated by 
political means. Of course, we accepted this policy to prevent 
the war from spreading and to avoid further destruction and more 
victims. Therefore, if one looks at the current situation on 
the territory of former Yugoslavia, in Europe and in the world, 
and if one looks at the search for a way of establishing 
international order in this region, I think that we can conclude 
that we have conducted a good policy. 
  [Correspondent] What the opposition holds against you most 
often are your talks with Milosevic. Would it not have been 
better had you not held talks with him, and what would have 
happened if you had not held talks with Milosevic? 
  [Tudjman] First, it was not only I who held talks with him, 
but all European and world diplomatic factors, including those 
who were trying to replace [Serbian President Slobodan] 
Milosevic with King Karadjordjevic, [former FRY Prime Minister 
Milan] Panic, and other opposition politicians, and also with 
[former FRY President Dobrica] Cosic and [Serbian Renewal 
Movement leader] Vuk Draskovic. But at the end, they reached 
the conclusion that he is the only politician who has power in 
Serbia today, and who should be talked to. Therefore, that was 
not my own decision, but the true state of affairs which did not 
depend on me. And, of course, one talks with one's opponents to 
achieve peace. 
  Our orientation, of course, could not have been only war 
because in terms of weapons we were inferior. As I have said, 
the Yugoslav Army -- the third or fourth strongest military 
power in Europe -- was against us, and we were disarmed, I mean, 
without an army, without arms. Therefore, both because of the 
situation and because of the influence of the international 
community, we had to turn to talks. 
  To those who say that I should not have talked with 
Milosevic: Isn't the Israeli prime minister holding talks with 
'Arafat; aren't all of them, including the French president, not 
only the cochairmen of the European conference but also such 
statesmen as the French president, talking with Milosevic? This 
is a shallow political approach, because our meeting aimed at 
creating prerequisites for a peaceful political solution and the 
absence of talks would lead to a deepening of the conflict, of 
the war, which the world was not willing to accept. The world, 
responsible international factors, have demanded, drawn our 
attention to the need to reach a political solution and 
normalize relations between Croatia and Serbia. 
  [Correspondent] I would be interested to hear some of your 
assessments. First, is there any likelihood that Serbia might 
provoke a new war and attack Croatia? 
  [Tudjman] I think not. During the talks we had on the basis 
of the present situation in which Croatia has already developed 
its own armed force, its own army, and in which the 
Yugo-communist army abandoned or was forced to abandon most 
Croatian territory, including Prevlaka and the whole of the 
Adriatic. [sentence as heard] 
  You see, one of the first European observers, Ambassador Van 
Hauten, the observer of the European Community, told me once in 
reference to the situation in former Yugoslavia, in Croatia: 
President, I cannot understand some of your people. They do not 
seem to see what is happening. You have succeeded, you have 
disarmed barracks, entire garrisons, and the Yugoslav Army; the 
Yugoslav Navy is leaving Pula and Rijeka -- they were still on 
Vis at that time. This is something that rarely happens in 
history. 
  In other words, in the situation we found ourselves the only 
way of gaining our own state, of preserving it, and achieving 
international recognition, was of course by resisting the 
aggression, by not allowing ourselves to be subjugated, and at 
the same time by aligning our policy with the policy of world 
factors to show them that we in Croatia are not a bunch of 
irresponsible people who wanted to set either the Balkans or the 
world on fire. Rather we wanted to achieve freedom, democracy, 
and sovereignty, in line with current international views. 
  [Correspondent] In your opinion, are the rebels in Croatia 
prepared to wage some kind of a war and is Croatia today 
prepared to respond to absolutely every attack? 
  [Tudjman] I haven't finished answering your first question, 
which is linked to this one. In such circumstances -- given 
present developments -- we have reached a stage in which today's 
Serbia or their Yugoslavia are no longer capable of starting a 
large-scale war against Croatia for many reasons: it was not 
capable of conquering Croatia in the initial period, it faced 
international isolation and sanctions, its economic situation is 
catastrophic, and finally, because all levels, even the most 
responsible ones, of the Serbian political leadership and also 
of society have realized that they should work on the 
normalization of Croatian-Serbian relations on the basis of 
mutual recognition, as a prerequisite for emerging from the kind 
of crisis which has befallen Serbia. Hence there is no direct 
threat of some Serbian offensive. Even if it took place it 
would be no threat to Croatia. Today, Croatia has an armed 
force which is capable of deterring this. There is no threat 
either of Serbs in Croatian areas under peace protection 
launching some kind of offensive. 
  Let me reply to something our people abroad are interested 
in. We have opted, we have resolutely opted for finding a 
solution in a peaceful way by guaranteeing the Serbian ethnic 
community not only all civil rights but all ethnic rights too, 
territorial autonomy in the two districts, Knin and Glina, where 
they are in the majority. We also advocate their gradual 
integration into the restoration of the infrastructure and the 
entire economic and legal system of Croatia. We have also made 
it clear that if this is not accepted we will be able to resolve 
this by other means today. 
  [Correspondent] The Croatian Army is entirely prepared for 
this. You have recently said that in the army there must be 
neither leftwing nor rightwing tendencies. The army must 
strictly implement state policies. Are there any tendencies 
within the army toward political interference in the 
organization of some parts of the Croatian Army? 
  [Tudjman] First of all, the military system of every 
country, 
including Croatia, is such that the army is an instrument of 
state policy. We must assume this point of view, particularly 
so in a young state, a young emerging army, in a country which 
is also subjected to the presence of foreign aggression, foreign 
occupation, as these Croatian areas placed under the protection 
of the peace force are in fact under Belgrade's occupation. 
Belgrade is sending in not only arms but personnel, too, 
including officers and even generals and admirals. 
  Consequently, there is a great deal of justifiable 
discontent 
among the Croatian people, and even among the ranks of the 
Croatian Army because these formations of ours know that they 
would be capable of settling accounts with these Serbian 
occupation formations as they demonstrated in the Maslenica and 
Gospic operations. There is also impatience. Understandably, 
in my capacity as a head of state and supreme commander, I 
demand that the army implement policies. 
  It means that they are implementing a policy of uging a 
peaceful resolution in order not to cause further destruction of 
Croatia and further casualties, and because, as you already 
know, the international community demands from us such efforts 
aimed at a peaceful resolution. You know that an atmosphere was 
created as if Croatia were preparing an all-out offensive 
against those areas; we received open threats, these threats 
being well-founded, that they would introduce sanctions against 
Croatia as well. Of course, we wanted to avoid that and 
therefore we are pursuing a policy of the kind we are 
discussing, and therefore we are not going to allow any 
different, separate policies. This would be detrimental to the 
interests of the Croatian state and of the Croatian people. 
  [Correspondent] Let us return to the Serbs in Croatia. Are 
you ready to offer something more to make them part of the 
constitution? 
  [Tudjman] First of all, in this regard, I consider our 
constitution to be at the level of the most advanced 
international constitutions. In the preamble to the 
constitution we said that Croatia is a national state of the 
Croatian people, but also a state of its citizens of all other 
nationalities, ethnic communities, minorities living in Croatia. 
We said this in order to show that after many centuries, the 
Croatian people have achieved their sovereignty. 
  But in the first article of our constitution we said that we 
do not speak of some kind of a national state, but we say that 
Croatia is a state of its citizens. Therefore, there is no need 
for us to change anything in our constitution, particularly in 
our constitutional law. In accordance with demands set by the 
international community and the international conference on 
former Yugoslavia, we passed the constitutional law in which we 
guarantee civil and ethnic rights to ethnic communities and 
national minorities, including the Serbs in Croatia. We also 
say there that the Serbs have the right to cultural autonomy, 
but also to territorial autonomy in those areas where they are a 
majority -- in Knin and in Glina. 
  Therefore, there is no need for constitutional changes, but 
there is a need for implementation. Implementation of these 
principles can only come after an agreement has been reached not 
only with the so-called local Serbs, but also with Belgrade 
because, as I have just said, Belgrade advocated the joining of 
these areas with greater Serbia and it is still controlling 
these local Serbs, who are no longer united, but it is still 
using them as an instrument of its policy. 
  Therefore, I think that we have reached a situation whereby 
these areas will gradually be incorporated into the 
constituional and legal order of Croatia under the pressure of 
their position in general and the balance of military forces and 
everything that results from the political isolation and 
economic collapse of Serbia and efforts by the international 
community to create conditions for peace and the restoration of 
international order. 
  [Correspondent] Let us return to Bosnia, Mr. president. Back 
in July this year you said in Geneva ahead of the conclusion of 
one of many agreements on Bosnia-Herzegovina that the side that 
did not honor the agreement would be exposed to pressure by the 
international community. This was a period when 
Bosnia-Herzegovina was proclaimed a union of republics. 
However, the war continues. What has happened to the pressure? 
Was there any pressure by the international community at all? 
  [Tudjman] There has been pressure and there still is. But, 
as I have just said, the Bosnian problem, the Bosnian crisis, 
objectively speaking, is very complex, the most complex in the 
world nowadays because there is no single standpoint in Europe 
and in the United States. Within Europe different countries 
have different approaches, there is no pressure that would be 
effective. It seems to me that in this respect we are following 
a positive trend in the sense that the European Union has taken 
over the initiative and is not leaving it only to the 
cochairmen, to Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, to conduct 
negotiations on the settlement of the crisis on the territory of 
former Yugoslavia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Now the European 
Union is more united in its approach. 
  In this context, I believe that we can conclude with every 
right that after the Geneva conference which was organized by 
the European Union, and after the Brussels conference, the 
position of Croatia has strengthened; that international factors 
have seen for themselves that Croatia's approach really does 
proceed from the standpoint of searching for objective ways out 
of the crisis, ways to restore peace. 
  There has been intensified pressure on Serbia, because it 
has 
been intimated on one side that if Serbia accepts a political 
solution then the sanctions will gradually be suspended; but on 
the other hand, there have been indications that under certain 
conditions, if everything that Serbia pledges to do is 
fulfilled, this could happen [as heard], otherwise the sanctions 
could even be intensified. 
  But, I would say that, apart from such an approach to the 
pressure on Serbia, it is even more important that Europe and 
the world have finally understood that Muslims are no longer 
only victims of Serbian aggression, which has actually been 
completed -- and they are hardly fighting each other any more -- 
but that the Muslims have turned against the Croats, and that 
the Muslims are now those who are carrying out aggressive 
operations, even threatening physical survival, perpetrating 
what the Serbs used to perpetrate -- ethnic cleansing of Muslim 
population. Now the Muslim extremists are perpetrating the same 
against the Croatian population in central Bosnia; the Muslim 
are on the offensive against areas of the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna, planning and aspiring to gain access to the sea, 
to divide Croatia, in which the Muslim plans to seize not only 
Neum, but also areas east of Metkovic, which coincides with 
Serbian imperialistic plans. 
  At the conferences that I have mentioned, but also in the 
developments following the signing of the Christmas truce -- 
with the Muslims continuing these offensives -- the world 
understood that it is now Muslims who can no longer be 
identified as victims, and that a hypocritical policy, I dare 
say, which allowed the Serbian aggression -- and the excuse that 
the Croats also bore responsibility for the alleged 
disintegration of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- can no longer be 
justified and be hidden behind unrealistic assessments by some 
powers. Therefore, I maintain that we can expect the world to 
exert more effective pressure on the Muslim leadership. 
  As far as I know, Willy Claes, president of the Council of 
Europe, has sent letters not only to Karadzic but also to 
Izetbegovic, asking them to observe the European Union's demands 
on ending the war. I can also say that we have achieved, at the 
highest level, full convergence of views regarding the Bosnian 
crisis with the Turkish Government. Representatives of the 
Islamic world as Turkey, and not only Turkey, are dissatisfied 
with the behavior of the Bosnian Muslim leaders who are 
continuing hostilities against the Croats. 
  For this reason, it is to be expected that such pressure, on 
both sides -- on the Serb side which is trying to keep as much 
of the occupied territory, and on the Muslim side which is 
trying to take from the Croats what it cannot from the Serbs -- 
will be more effective and that it will eventually bring an end 
to the war. 
  [Correspondent] Today we are giving peace a chance and 
saying: Enough, enough of blood and tears. These were the words 
of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, when he extended his 
hand to Yasir 'Arafat. This was seen in the world as the 
absolute event of the year, the greatest sensation. But a 
sensation does not last very long unless it is very soon 
followed by concrete steps. Is such a sensation to be expected 
in our areas? Do we have a Yasir 'Arafat? 
  [Tudjman] You see, we do not have a Yasir 'Arafat in the 
Croatian territories occupied by Serbian units. As you know the 
Serbian ringleaders bicker mutually to the point of isolation. 
They cannot agree over the elections or after the elections, 
from Knin to Baranja. There is no serious man there with whom 
we can discuss the political resolution of the problem. 
Therefore, regarding our Croatian areas under Serbian 
occupation -- 'Arafat is in Belgrade. And for this reason we 
have conducted the kind of talks that we did, within the 
conference, not only of our own volition but also initiated by 
the cochairmen of the conference on former Yugoslavia and 
Bosnia, who, in agreement with the most influential European and 
world states, invite to the talks those who are most responsible 
for the situation and who should bring peace. 
  [Correspondent] You mentioned numerous meetings, 
conferences, 
talks. How should the proposals and the things that have been 
agreed be put into practice? 
  [Tudjman] Clearly, the first problem is that Europe should 
reach an internal agreement on what it really wants. The 
contradictions within Europe, to do with attempts to secure 
spheres of interest in the former Yugoslavia -- the former 
Yugoslavia was created after World War I because of some spheres 
of interest of the western forces, France and England on one 
side, Germany on the other, and also the then Soviet Union. 
Today, again, there is not enough unity in Europe although we 
must not fail to notice a significant change. For the first 
time, [French Foreign Minister Alain] Juppe and [German Foreign 
Minister Klaus] Kinkel's proposal has presented a more unified 
European view of the crisis. Certain proposals indicate that 
the viewpoint is gaining ground in Europe that everything 
possible should be done to bring an end to the war. 
  It should also be noted that there is still no necessary 
unity between Europe and -- if we say the United Nations, that 
is really only a formal description, we should be saying the 
United States to be completely clear. But there are still joint 
efforts to bring an end to the war that are not only posing a 
threat to peace and preventing international order from being 
established but also creating a danger of conflicts between 
different civilizations in the area. 
  With regard to the involvement of the Islamic mojahedin 
volunteers on the Muslim side and the volunteers from the former 
Soviet Union and today's Russia from the old Bolshevik or 
radical Orthodox ranks, if the war is not halted there is a 
threat of a civilizational conflict. For this reason, the 
international community has shown increasing appreciation of 
Croatia's constructive policy which, while not abandoning the 
real, essential interests of the Croatian people and state, is 
still making a contribution to the international community's 
efforts to achieve peace and create preconditions for 
establishing international order in this part of Europe, on the 
territory where the former Yugoslavia disintegrated. 
  It is clear that those forces in international politics 
which 
have a decisive influence over the creation of international 
order believe that the future international order in this area 
can be built with Croatia and with Serbia, and of course with 
the other states that have been created. But nobody really 
counts on the survival of Bosnia-Herzegovina any more. And this 
situation was not created by Croatian policy. As I have said, 
we supported the preservation of Bosnia-Herzegovina as one state 
but it was clear to us that Bosnia-Herzegovina could not be 
preserved as a single, unitary state. Proposals for a 
confederal organization have not, to this very date, been 
accepted by the Muslims. This reveals to Europe and to the 
world their simplistic approaches to the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  All in all, from this very complicated situation and 
horrible 
war in Bosnia-Herzegovina we have finally reached a stage in 
which there are no unknown factors. Consequently, the 
international community will have to take steps without any 
illusion that it should, for example, please the Muslims, as 
some have advocated at all costs -- not just because of the 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina but because of the influence of 
the Islamic states in the world. At the same time, while 
discovering the present Muslim position, the international 
community has not disregarded the fact -- and neither have we 
ever -- that Serbia was the one which caused the war with its 
aggression. One of the greatest successes of our policy lies in 
our succeeding -- on the basis of Resolution 871 and at every 
single meeting and at the international conference -- in drawing 
attention to the fact that the aggression in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
must be linked with Serbian aggression in the occupied areas, 
now UN Protected Areas [UNPA]. 
  Regardless of our primary interest in resolving the UNPA 
issue, objectively this problem is linked with 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and we cannot resolve it on our own, without 
help from the international community. However, our success 
lies in arousing the desire of the international community to 
put pressure on Serbia to end its aggression and to accept a 
solution which is acceptable to other nation. Thus, we have 
succeeded in linking the sanctions -- the only means which have 
an effect on Serbia -- with a solution not only for Bosnia, but 
also for Croatia. 
  [Correspondent] We come across the international community 
at 
negotiating tables. You mentioned constructiveness. You are 
now a statesman with considerable negotiating experience. What 
are the other important factors in negotiations? Resolve, 
inflexibility, support of the international community? What 
about interests? 
  [Tudjman] Indeed, interests guide both individuals and 
nations. I could give you many examples of world politicians who 
said that there were no friends, allies, or enemies for 
eternity, but it is interests which direct and influence our 
behavior. 
  One should recall that the Scandinavian countries -- 
Scandinavia is today an example of democracy and international 
and interstate relations -- that they were at loggerheads until 
as recently as the beginning of this century. They even waged 
wars against each other in earlier centuries. One should recall 
that in Europe the two largest nations, Germany and France, 
waged a great deal of war against each other in this century, as 
well as in the last century, whereas today they are the mainstay 
of a European union, an alliance. 
  Consequently, I believe that the former Yugoslavia -- which 
collapsed because it was an artificial creation, that it was 
composed of nations which did not only have different national 
identities, but which also belonged to different civilizations 
-- that Yugoslavia disintegrated in a period when its 
disintegration was imminent, during the collapse of Communist 
socialism and multinational countries in Europe. 
  It was not only Yugoslavia that disintegrated, it was also 
the democratic Czech and Slovak Republic and the Soviet Union. 
Almost all multinational creations disintegrated during the 
collapse of Communist socialism. Therefore, Bosnia-Herzegovina 
was also unable to avoid such a destiny in that historical 
period, even if other individual policies in many aspects had 
been pursued. Consequently, it is expectable -- and I have to 
say that I could recall having predicted even 20 years ago that 
a united Europe of nations would be created, a Europe in which 
small nations would find their solution, their sovereignty, 
their independence. 
  The Yugoslav idea originated on Croatian soil. The idea 
was based on the premise that Croatia could have hegemony, that 
it could be the leader of the Yugoslav community because of its 
more advanced culture, because of its higher civilizational 
level. On the other side, the Serbian side, were the people who 
understood the Yugoslav idea as merely a greater Serbia. And to 
this very day they have done everything possible to create a 
greater Serbia out of Yugoslavia, that is why Yugoslavia has 
disintegrated. And now they are trying to occupy the Croatian 
areas which have never been a constituent part of Serbia. 
  But it has been shown in practice that they cannot achieve 
this, both because of the balance of forces between Serbia and 
Croatia and because the international community will not allow 
it. Therefore, I anticipate that the war will end, relations 
will be normalized, and a certain Scandinavization will take 
place as a precondition for establishing international order in 
this part of Europe, because the warring parties themselves 
cannot permanently remain at war and the world cannot allow it 
either. 
  [Correspondent] What is the price of this? What is the price 
of peace? 
  [Tudjman] Even the greatest price paid for peace is lower 
than the cheapest war -- war in the sense of human casualties, 
material destruction, and the deepening of hatred. Every nation 
has at some stage understandably achieved peace through the 
defeat of one side, and of course with the understanding that 
conditions must be created to sustain peace, to make coexistence 
possible, if not as friends then as tolerant neighbors. It 
seems to me that this region is now witnessing the final act of 
one such perception. 
  [Correspondent] What should really happen for Croatia to 
accept a change to its borders or for an exchange of 
territories? Could this happen in order to achieve peace? 
  [Tudjman] Regarding Croatian borders, on more than one 
occasion I told all European, world, and U.S. diplomats and 
statesmen who asked me if we could perhaps compromise that 
Croatia cannot make any territorial concessions because Croatia 
entered the former Yugoslav community with much more territory 
than the territory within the Croatian borders in federal 
Yugoslavia and also more than the territory of Croatia within 
its current internationally recognized borders. Therefore, 
there is no reason why Croatia should make any territorial 
concessions. 
  Apart from this, regarding the demands made by Belgrade that 
the Serbs in Croatia should have the right to 
self-determination, I have told them and others in the world 
that according to international law and according to the real 
situation in the world it is nations and not national minorities 
that have the right to self- determination and to their own 
states. The Serbs were a national minority in Croatia, formed 
in the 16th century. Let us not go into that now. While the 
Yugo-communist army was here, that minority amounted to as much 
as 12 percent. After the army's departure this fell by further 
2 or 3 percent, and then fell again because of the war. 
  Therefore, there is no reason why Serbia should fail to 
understand that the Serbs in Croatia can and must enjoy things 
and that Croatia is ready to grant them all civil and ethnic 
rights, but they cannot enjoy the position of the herren-volk, 
of the ruling nation in Croatia. The problem not only of 
Albanians in Kosovo, but also of the Hungarians and Croats in 
Serbia, is even greater than the problem of the Serbs in 
Croatia. That issue cannot be analyzed as an isolated issue, 
but Serbia must understand that peace can be achieved on the 
basis of mutual recognition in the existing borders, not only on 
the basis of reciprocity but also on the basis of international 
conventions on national minority rights. 
  You mentioned concessions. There is still the problem of 
what kind of demarcation. As things stand now the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina can be solved. A union of republics is no 
longer mentioned as a solution because, well, we favored a 
union, we signed an agreement with Izetbegovic, I personally 
signed it, under which the Muslim and Croatian republic within 
the union would develop ever closer relations and friendship 
with each other and with Croatia. However, two days later 
Izetbegovic signed an agreement with the Serbs, thus practically 
agreeing on the seperation of the republics, on the 
disintegration of the union, but with the Muslim state 
inheriting the right to UN membership and other international 
rights enjoyed by Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The Muslim leadership is now categorically demanding to have 
Neum, to such an extent that the international community has now 
demanded that Croatia secure access to the sea for the future 
Bosnian Muslim republic. The Muslims are demanding territorial 
sovereignty. When I categorically refused this and said that 
under no circumstances could we agree to Neum becoming part of 
the Muslim republic, i.e. that part of the Croatian national 
territory be divided, with the separation of the southern-most 
part and of Dubrovnik -- and in this respect the Muslim demand 
coincides with the imperialistic and aggressive Serbian policy 
since the last century. [sentence as heard] In this war, too, 
they wanted to take Dubrovnik. We cannot agree to that. An 
idea was thus born in Europe and among the Muslims that we would 
give them access to the sea at Prevlaka and in return Neum would 
immediately go to Croatia, i.e. that Croatia would get the 
Dubrovnik hinterland in return, which would be more than 
compensation for Croatia, according to some international 
circles. 
  In our quest for peace, as I have said, we can also take 
such 
a solution into consideration, as we have offered the Muslims a 
free zone in Ploce and the possibility of building a port on the 
Neretva River as their access to the sea. We have offered them a 
free zone in Rijeka, having in mind western Bosnia -- Bihac and 
Cazin Krajina. We have also taken into consideration the issue 
of granting them access to the sea in the area of Prevlaka. 
  I have told the most responsible people in Europe and the 
United States that we are willing to consider every suggestion 
which is in the interest of peace without being damaging to 
Croatia, i.e. which is beneficial to Croatia. I have also 
pointed out, though, that at the same time, the problem of 
Prevlaka is a rather wider problem since the promontory of Ostri 
Vrh, the tip of Prevlaka, controls access to Boka Kotorska. 
Hence, it might represent a strategic interest, not merely a 
Croatian, Serbian, or Muslim interest, within wider developments 
given the fact that Russia -- regardless of whether it is ruled 
by Peter the Great, Ivan the Terrible, Stalin, or Yeltsin today, 
or someone like Zhirinovsky tomorrow -- such as it is, will 
always remain a Eurasian power and it will always aspire to 
gaining access to the Mediterranean. 
  This problem is thus linked to Croatia's interest to protect 
Dubrovnik and its integrity and to make the territory of the 
Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna as compact as possible so we 
can achieve peace as well as the most compact territory in order 
to strategically secure Croatia's borders. Consequently, we 
approach this issue with a great deal of tact. We are willing 
to consider it from the point of view of Croatian historic and 
strategic interests and to reach agreement with our allies, with 
our friends in the world, not just from today's point of view 
but from the point of view of potential relations in the future. 
  [Correspondent] Mr president, when do you think the UN 
Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] will leave Croatia? 
  [Tudjman] The moment we reach a political solution on the 
integration of these Croatian areas in the constitutional system 
of Croatia by peaceful means or -- if we are forced, i.e. if 
Serbs [words indistinct] -- by military means. But I hope we 
are on the road to signing a general cease-fire agreement and 
the end of hostilities and on gradual integration by way of 
opening up roads, railways, power lines, gas pipelines, etc, 
which is not only in the interest of Croatia but also in the 
interest of the currently occupied areas, of Serbia, and of all 
neighboring countries which means Europe as well. 
  [Correspondent] Last year was a year for reexamining almost 
all international organizations, above all with regard to the 
settlement of the Balkan crisis, to the United Nations and NATO. 
In September, at the opening of the UN General Assembly [UNGA] 
session, you warned of the power of national interests in the UN 
Security Council [UNSC] whenever major decisions were being 
made. Has anything changed since? 
  [Tudjman] I do not think so. All the major components, [word 
indistinct], of this policy have remained the same. National 
interests, you see, there is a political periscope, a problem of 
approach to national interests and the national issue and also 
in practice [sentence as heard]. 
  Namely, the western world, both Europe and the United 
States, 
often approach the national problem in a one-sided way. They 
understand that the disintegration of both socialism and 
multinational countries has even led to national expansionism, 
but they forget that national democratic movements were the main 
force in toppling the Stalinist-type communism, and that the 
creation of national states which is now taking place is the 
process which in Western Europe and Scandinavia took place in 
the last century or at the turn of the century. 
  Therefore, the creation and national interests themselves 
and 
the efforts to secure national interests are not negative by 
nature. They become negative at the moment a nation starts 
pursuing an expansionist program, as is the case in Serbia with 
the program for the creation of greater Serbia. However, the 
settlement of interethnic relations and protection of national 
interests is a precondition for the creation of a normal and 
stable international order. 
  [Correspondent] Of course, this was all about 
decision-making 
in the UNGA and the functioning of the entire system of the UN, 
i.e. the peace forces. It is a fact that in almost all hotbeds 
of crisis in the world the peacekeeping forces are in some way 
experiencing the same fate. The message coming from those whom 
the UN is supposed to protect is: Go home. Is the main role of 
the UN understated or is this protection of peace being carried 
out incorrectly? 
  [Tudjman] You see, we must be realistic in this respect. The 
crisis on former Yugoslav soil, especially in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, is one of the most overt, exacerbated, and 
convoluted ones, but it is not the only one. There are such 
crises elsewhere in the world: if not 20 there are at least 10 
of them. Therefore, the United Nations is frustrated in many 
ways: first, there is no effective international instrument 
which could be used to impose UN Security Council [UNSC] 
resolutions. There is no effective international instrument 
that could be used to impose UNSC Resolution decisions. Our 
people are rightly embittered about UNPROFOR -- rightly so and 
for the most part -- because UNPROFOR failed to accomplish its 
mission. However, the agreement on the involvement of UNPROFOR 
was based on the sides in conflict, i.e. both Croatia and 
Serbia, accepting a political solution and disarming the Serbian 
paramilitary units, while Croatia was to ensure political rights 
for the Serbian ethnic community in Croatia. The Serbs rejected 
this and UNPROFOR, with the mandate it received from the UNSC 
and the forces and equipment it had at its disposal, was not set 
a task of imposing the Vance-Owen plan by force. Consequently, 
the demand [for UNPROFOR] to go home is justified. However, one 
tends to forget the fact that the Serbs, i.e. Belgrade, were 
responsible for UNPROFOR's failure to carry out its duties, as 
Belgrade put up a resistance to UNPA being integrated into the 
constitutional and legal system of Croatia and is still 
maintaining the idea that these areas could one day be included 
in some kind of a federation of Serbian states, i.e. a greater 
Serbia. 
  [Correspondent] The UN on its own cannot impose peace, but 
there is another organization which can do that -- NATO. Its 
function is to protect safety in Europe. What is the role of 
NATO generally if its activity boils down to verbal duels and 
warnings that peace is necessary for the stable development of 
Europe? 
  [Tudjman] Our people are rightly embittered about UNPROFOR. 
Rightly so for the most part because UNPROFOR failed to 
accomplish its mission. However, the agreement on the 
involvement of UNPROFOR was based on the sides in conflict, both 
Croatia and Serbia, accepting a political solution and disarming 
the Serbian paramilitary units, while Croatia was to ensure 
political rights for the Serbian ethnic community in Croatia. 
The Serbs rejected this and UNPROFOR, with the mandate it 
received from the UNSC and the forces and equipment it had at 
its disposal, was not set the task of forcefully imposing the 
Vance-Owen plan. Consequently, the demand for UNPROFOR to go 
home is justified, but one tends to forget the fact that the 
Serbs, Belgrade, were responsible for UNPROFOR's failure to 
carry out its duties, as Belgrade put up resistance to UNPA 
being integrated into the constitutional and legal system of 
Croatia, and is still maintaining the idea that these areas 
could one day be included in some kind of a federation of 
Serbian states -- a greater Serbia. 
  [Correspondent] The United Nations on its own cannot impose 
peace. But there is another organization which can do that -- 
NATO. Its function is to protect safety in Europe. What is the 
role of NATO generally if its activity boils down to verbal 
duels and warnings that peace is necessary for the stable 
development of Europe? 
  [Tudjman] Well, we must again bear in mind that NATO came 
into being at the time when on the other side constituted the 
Warsaw Pact, in other words, the bipolar division of the world, 
and that under its internal principles NATO is not expected to 
intervene outside the NATO countries. This is one point. 
  We are faced with a lack of unity in Europe and in the 
United 
States. Until unity is achieved as to what they want and who 
decides there can be no NATO involvement. 
  I have proposed to European and U.S. factors, both at 
conferences and in written form, the involvement of NATO because 
this is an efficient organization from the technical point of 
view and with its own leadership. I even said that I thought if 
NATO were to get involved we would not need any more forces than 
the UNPROFOR has at present. UNPROFOR is disorganized. Both in 
Croatia and Bosnia we have units from Canada, Kenya, Ukraine, 
Russia, France, and England. All these forces are not adequately 
equipped technically, there is not enough unity among them and, 
understandably, their approach is different. If NATO were to 
become organized as a forceful military organization, then this 
would have a psychological impact on the warring parties and, 
contrary to what is happening today, would force them to adhere 
to what they have agreed upon. 
  For NATO involvement to be possible Europe and the United 
States should know what they want to achieve politically. An 
armed intervention can only be effective if its goal is 
well-defined. 
  [Correspondent] There were times when it was known that 
decisions on the issues of war and peace were made in either 
Washington or Moscow. Where are these decisions being made 
today? 
  [Tudjman] The problem is in the fact that today the European 
Union or alliance is coming into existence, but it is obvious 
that within it there are different views coming from Paris, 
London, and Bonn. The issue is who in the Union will have the 
upper hand, both when it comes to the state and, 
obviously...[pauses] I was told by one, and not just one state 
president but by many others, that Europe today should be more 
united about having a more decisive leadership, and that the 
world is in a state of turmoil without a more determined 
leadership, without a vision of what the new world order should 
be after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. There is 
anxiety in the world over the fact that about dozen states still 
possess nucelar weapons, and there is a need for a balance of 
powers and that the main world powers are trying to secure their 
own spheres of influence -- the world is as it has been since 
time immemorial. We must not delude ourselves by thinking that 
it will be easy to establish a new world order. 
  [Correspondent] What is the main threat to peace in the 
world at present? 
  [Tudjman] The hotbeds of crisis in the world and, as far as 
we are concerned, the ones in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in UNPAs. 
However, in this regard I think that in our conversation today I 
mentioned the fact that there is a serious danger of a conflict 
between civilizations. This is what is worrying, especially 
regarding the example of Bosnia-Herzegovina. But precisely for 
that reason, as a conflict between civilizations could bring 
into question human civilization itself, it is realistic to 
expect that reason will prevail in the world, and that they 
would gather around a program by which a new world order would 
be restored on this disarray that we are witnessing, so that a 
world catastrophe could be avoided. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, we have many more questions 
for you, but questions from our viewers are pouring in. We have 
to reply to them. I think that our viewers' questions are the 
most important. Let us reply to questions that have been asked. 
Please be brief and to the point as people lay great store by 
it. A viewer from Zagreb: Why doesn't the president -- that 
means you -- tell Izetbegovic that, if he [Izetbegovic] does not 
stop the offensive against Croats in Bosnia we will send all 
Muslim refugees in Croatia back to Bosnia? 
  [Tudjman] Because the world would then say that we are 
acting 
in an inhumane fashion. If the war were to continue, of course 
we would be forced to take such decisive steps, but we are first 
trying all we can together with these people [Muslims] to end 
the war and reach a political solution. 
  [Correspondent] Branko Vrbanc from Zagreb: Mr. President, 
thanks to you the Croats in Croatia and worldwide have united as 
never before. Now that we have achieved sovereignty and foreign 
acclaim, some opposition party leaders are trying to break up 
that unity by all means. I do not think any democratic state 
would allow any such agitators who make public statements to go 
unpunished. What can you do to prevent that? 
  [Tudjman] I think the Croatian people is politically mature, 
it has accomplished the creation of its own state, and it can be 
proud that in Croatia we have established a more stable 
democratic order than in any other former communist country. 
Therefore, the opposition -- and not only the opposition, as 
there are opposition parties with serious political approaches, 
but there have been some anarchic phenomena particularly in 
journalism, which requires other measures; however, Croatia's 
democratic order is sufficiently strong to resist all that. 
With this crisis our policy will be even better affirmed before 
our people and the world as the correct one, and therefore 
opposing views will not be threatening. 
  [Correspondent] Another viewer would like to know how long 
will we have to delude ourselves that the world and Europe will 
resolve the UNPA issue? 
  [Tudjman] Not for one moment did I have any illusion that 
the 
world would solve our problems for us, but we have had to 
coordinate efforts to resolve the problems with our forces with 
international factors -- and that remains to be our problem -- 
because we do not live in a vacuum, but in the world such as it 
is. 
  [Correspondent] How does Mr. President intend to achieve an 
integral Croatia by pursuing such a peaceloving policy when, in 
the daily news today, we heard a statement by [Bosnian Serb 
assembly chairman] Momcilo Krajisnik that the Bosnian republic 
of Srpska and occupied territories in Croatia, the so-called 
Krajina, that they would join their mother country, Serbia, by 
next year. 
  [Tudjman] I intend to resolve the Krajina problem by 
political means, but I have said -- if necessary -- by military 
means. However, if Momcilo Krajisnik keeps repeating such 
statements on the unification of Serbian republics -- as he said 
it, or whatever he said -- we should tell him that for the first 
time lately, after the Geneva and Brussels conferences, Serbian 
President Milosevic himself said that we should work on the 
normalization of relations and the gradual settlement of the 
UNPA problem by opening up roads and other problems. 
  Serbian Foreign Minister Jovanovic has also recently stated 
that problems ought to be resolved in that sense. In opposition 
to such statements as those made by Krajisnik, there are those 
which are much more authoritative, showing that it is necessary 
to reach a political solution within Croatia. 
  [Correspondent] Does urging a peaceful resolution of the 
crisis in occupied areas of the Republic of Croatia come as a 
result of Croatia's military inferiority as it has recently been 
said in foreign press commentaries? 
  [Tudjman] No, it is certain that in the beginning, in 1990 
and 1991, we were militarily inferior, because we had the entire 
Yugoslav Army against us -- Serbia and Montenegro. We were 
militarily inferior then, but not today, in relation to Serbian 
forces between Knin and Baranja. 
  However, it is also certain that if we were forced to seek a 
military solution then we would suffer casualties and further 
destruction, and that would delay our economic development, and 
so on. Therefore, it is in Croatia's interest, and also because 
of coordination with the world, and even with those in the world 
who are Croatia's honest friends -- we also have those. 
Therefore, we should try to do everything to find a politically 
based resolution. We did not forget for a moment that we would 
not tolerate such a situation contravening Croatia's interests, 
and that we would, should it become obvious that a political 
solution is not possible, that, with the armed forces we have 
created, with the unity of the Croatian people, and not just of 
the refugees but also with the unity of the entire Croatian 
people, that we would most certainly take measures to liberate 
every inch of Croatian soil. 
  [Correspondent] Jure Madjar from Sisak asks: Is there an 
example in history whereby someone waged a war of conquest and 
then returned occupied territories following negotiations. 
  [Tudjman] There are. When they were forced to do so. 
  [Correspondent] A refugee from Vukovar: What is the Croatian 
Government intending to do regarding the missing defenders of 
Vukovar? 
  [Tudjman] We have been doing everything possible. According 
to details at hand, 6,800 people have been registered as killed. 
A year ago we still had around 13,500 missing people. That 
list of missing people has gradually decreased and today there 
are 7,000 people on the list of missing people. We have 
exchanged hundreds of POW's with Serbia. We reached an 
agreement to exchange those about which we know, for instance 
the Croatian group held in Sombor -- they are demanding the 
Karlovac group -- and on this we reached an agreement. This was 
all worked on previously by Vice Premier Mate Granic; now it is 
worked on by Vice Premier Kostovic. 
  In the course of my talks with Milosevic, this was one of 
the 
reasons behind these talks -- to solve this question as well. 
He said in the presence of witnesses that he was ready, that 
they would release those who are being held in their prisons so 
we would release prisoners here. He claimed that in Serbia 
there are no others. 
  Consequently, we are working on the final resolution of the 
problem of Vukovar and not only Vukovar but that of all those 
other people who are still registered as missing. 
Unfortunately, we must be certain that most of those who we 
still regard as missing are probably dead or have been exposed 
to a massacre, terror, and death. This is one of the reasons 
that I have always pointed out that I will do everything to 
avoid paying for Croatian freedom, Croatian sovereignty with 
more casualties unless they are necessary. 
  At the same time I am aware -- I have said this too -- that 
no people have ever in their history acquired freedom without 
casualties. No people have had their freedom served on a plate. 
I am therefore aware that if need be one should be resolute 
enough to wage a holy war for the homeland. Before this we will 
indeed do everything so our policies aided by the international 
community reach the final goal in a peaceful way without further 
casualties. 
  [Correspondent] Croatian police and judicial authorities 
held war criminals Hadzic [Goran Hadzic, former Krajina 
president], Arkan [Zeljko Raznjatovic, Serbian paramilitary 
leader] and others? 
  [Tudjman] Well, from this point of view that act is 
unjustifiable. However, one should remember that not only the 
Serbs in Croatia and Serbia but also the international public 
are blaming the Croatian authorities for not having a correct 
attitude toward the Serbs, implying that they were forced to 
rebel and fight for secession because of our terror. It is 
clear that this is not true. After we established our democratic 
government I was the one who initiated talks with the most 
radical Serbs -- with the late Professor Raskovic. The Serbs at 
that time did not accept the communists, the Serbian communists 
in our parliament as their representatives. Therefore, we 
wanted a political solution. Our policy was to talk to all 
Serbs, even the radical ones, in order to find a political 
solution. 
  I was not informed that Arkan and Hadzic would be released. 
On one hand individuals decided in Hadzic's case because he was 
held by the police while Arkan was brought to court and the 
court let him go. The court did not consult the Croatian 
authorities and it made an independent decision. This is an 
example of how the judicial authorities should be independent in 
reaching their verdict, but this decision also must be in 
accordance with the state policy. Arkan was known for his 
terrorist actions even in former Yugoslavia. 
  This is my reply to your question. On one hand there was a 
political effort to create preconditions for normal life with 
the Serbs in Croatia by avoiding cases like these. On the other 
hand as you can see a wrong decision was made by the judicial 
authorities as they independently made their decisions. 
  [Correspondent] Were you, in the capacity of the president 
of 
the state, informed about a newspaper report on alleged crimes 
perpetrated in the course of 1991? Further, how is it possible 
that a document, whose existence Minister Jarnjak confirmed in 
his assembly address saying that it was a state secret, has 
leaked into the public? 
  [Tudjman] I was not informed about it. I first read about it 
on Christmas, on 25 December, and I wrote about it -- actually 
after it was published. 
  This report was submitted to the office for the protection 
of 
constitutional order, which was then chaired by Josip Manolic. 
It did not reach me, but we had clear....[pauses] Both the 
government was tasked and the council of defence and national 
security examined that issue and said -- not only said, but gave 
the following guidelines, orders to all competent bodies of 
state administration -- every crime, every robbery should 
relentlessly be not only curbed and prevented, but the 
perpetrators should also be called to account and punished 
accordingly. 
  We also said that neither can we tolerate vengeful actions 
by 
people in the course of combat. Therefore, what the report says 
should have been prevented, and people should have been called 
to account. Why and how it happened that the report was 
published is a task for the state prosecutor and our national 
security service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs to find 
out. This was either lack of responsibility in dealing with 
state documents or even an attempt to compromise our democratic 
authorities and the leadership. 
  These are things that we cannot tolerate. I am particularly 
interested in not only why and how the report was published, but 
also what happened to all those people who are listed in the 
report as having perpetrated criminal acts. Therefore, I have 
set a task to examine all this, and I am pleased that the 
Assembly has begun discussing these issues, and hence the public 
and the Croatian Assembly can be informed about it. 
  [Correspondent] Why doesn't Croatia insist on a deadline in 
connection with the implementation of Resolution 871? 
  [Tudjman] We certainly wanted and sought this, but we are 
faced here with an international situation and international 
factors that are making a connection between the resolution of 
the UNPA zones in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. And our 
demand could only be as it is -- i.e., we are seeking a 
departure, and after this we will take responsibility for the 
renewal of the war or its expansion. Here -- as we have been 
told not only by those international factors who do not go along 
with us but also by our friends -- we would be exposed to the 
renewal of the war and also to international sanctions. [as 
heard] So we did not want to get ourselves into a situation in 
which (?Serbia)....[sentence incomplete as heard] 
  [Correspondent] (Pane Brtic) from Pula asks: Some say that 
the building of the tunnel through Cicarija and the tunnels 
through Velebit and Maslenica bridge are white elephants, or 
were these merely election promises? If not, when will these 
projects be finished? 
  [Tudjman] They will be completed in a year or so. I think 
that at that time we said, did we not, that the work had begun 
and would be continued, and it is quite clear that both through 
Velebit [as heard] and the tunnel through Ucka are of vital 
interest not only in terms of linking Istria with Croatia in a 
political sense -- a national-political sense -- but also in an 
economic sense. 
  I will tell you now what you may not know -- neither does 
our 
public know: Croatian politicians from Istria -- such as Ante 
Mandic, who was one of the members of the Yugoslav Committee and 
who was in favor of unification of all south-Slavonic countries, 
for the creation of Yugoslavia, and who was also a participant 
of the anti-fascist war -- immediately after the war he proposed 
to Tito, after Istria had joined its Croatian homeland, that a 
tunnel be made. Tito agreed with Mandic that this should be 
done, but Croatian and Yugoslav political circles turned a deaf 
ear to it, saying that this would be too expensive. Later only 
a road tunnel was made, while the rail tunnel was left 
to...[pauses] Not only railway line, but it was also the airport 
in Pula that was organized by the Slovenes. Therefore, it is 
natural that with the establishment of an independent Croatia we 
should adopt a decision that we would also build a rail tunnel, 
in order to realize the idea which the revivalists in Istria 
advocated back in the last century, and which as I have said was 
mentioned as a necessity for Istria, for Croatia, even by such 
people as I have mentioned, despite all those aspirations toward 
Istria. 
  [Correspondent] After Istria, someone from Slavonski Brod. A 
viewer from Slavonski Brod has put this question: Is Croatia 
going to help the Croats in central Bosnia before it is too late? 
  [Tudjman] Croatia has been doing everything to help the 
Croats. Primarily we wanted to help them in the way of having 
friendly relations with the Muslim leadership in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. We said that the survival of the Croats 
living in Vares, Kakanj, and Zepce is a guarantee that the 
Muslims will likewise enjoy the same rights in those areas that 
were envisaged to be Croat provinces, which is now the Croat 
republic of Herceg-Bosna. Therefore, we wanted to secure their 
future in a political way, but on the other hand we aided them 
in their defense, first from the Serbian aggression, then from 
the Muslim one as much as we could. 
  We will do so in the future as well. Not only in those areas 
that I have mentioned, but also in the entire area that the 
Muslims are now trying to occupy: Novi Travnik, Vitez, Busovaca, 
Kresevo, Kiseljak, and so on. Therefore, not only through 
direct negotiations, talks with Izetbegovic and Silajdzic, but 
also through the involvement of those international factors that 
are interested in restoring peace and friendship between the 
Muslims and Croatia as soon as possible, such as Turkey, 
Austria, Germany; I even invited European Council President 
Claes to attend our meeting with Izetbegovic in Vienna in order 
that we could achieve all that. Unfortunately not very 
successfully so far, but most certainly we are not going to give 
up the protection of the Croat people in Bosnia for a single 
moment or the protection of the strategic interests of the 
Croatian state in relation to the resolution of the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Correspondent] A viewer from Sisak asks whether there has 
been a change in Croatia's official policy in respect to the 
resolution of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, having in mind 
some confusing statements by high-ranking Croatian officials. 
  [Tudjman] No, there has been no change because there is no 
need for it. We have conducted a consistent policy: If it is 
possible to preserve Bosnia as a whole, independent state, that 
is possible only on a confederal basis. But if there is a 
split-up as Izetbegovic agreed with the Serbs, it is normal that 
-- if Izetbegovic agreed for the republic of Srpska in Bosnia to 
join Serbia -- the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna should join 
Croatia, while the position of the Croat population remaining in 
other republics should be safeguarded on the basis of 
reciprocity and with international guarantees. 
  [Correspondent] Ana Vulic from Split asks if you are aware 
that Alija Izetbegovic signed a secret agreement with the Serbs 
on the day he was held in captivity. Should we not ban him from 
entering Croatia? 
  [Tudjman] Croatia has a strategic interest in maintaining 
friendly relations with the Muslims in order to keep as large a 
part of Bosnia-Herzegovina as possible, out of the reach of 
Croatia's main enemy. The West is also interested in this. You 
are aware of the differences between eastern and western Europe; 
since the breakup of the Roman Empire and Christianity. We had 
a situation in which the Serbs were so numerous in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina that they could impose their republic and 
secession. The West did not prevent this, they did not prevent 
the Serbian aggression. Why? It could even be that they wanted 
to prevent the creation of an Islamic state in Europe. At the 
same time, many factors would like to make the Bosnian Muslims 
accept Western Civilization through cooperation with Croatia. 
In that sense Croatia and the western world have common 
interests, and that is why we are doing everything we can to end 
hostilities between Croats and Muslims, to create normal 
relations in the interest of Croatia and the West, which above 
all takes care of its own interests and its relations with 
Islamic states. 
  As you know there are 51 Islamic states in the United 
Nations 
and they possess not only oil, but they also have capital in 
many European states and throughout the world. This is why we 
cannot look at this as relations between the Croats and the 
Muslims alone. Of course this aspect is the most important one 
but we also have to coordinate our interests with the most 
important international factors. 
  [Correspondent] Let us return to the international 
negotiations. Milan from Zagreb asks why do you not make your 
presence at negotiations on Bosnia conditional on the withdrawal 
of Serb forces from Croatia and is it not naive to negotiate 
with the Muslims about their access to the sea? 
  [Tudjman] Who can say that I have not demanded this from the 
Serbs [Tudjman laughs] and who could imagine that we have been 
naive even for a moment. If we had been naive we would not have 
achieved our independent and internationally recognized Croatia 
despite all opposition. Our people can trust us and we can make 
our state even stronger based on our achievements. 
  [Correspondent] A viewer from Split: After the fall of 
Bugojno [Bosnian town disputed by the Croats and the Muslims, 
currently held by the Muslims] Muslim refugees [in Croatia] 
celebrated this event in Hotel Neptun in Tucepi [Croatian resort 
on the Dalmatian coast]. Of course, this caused a clash with 
Croat refugees and local people. Hundreds of thousands of 
Muslim refugees are in Croatia today and at the same time their 
sons, husbands, and brothers are attacking Croats in central 
Bosnia. It seems that in this way Croatia is indirectly helping 
the aggression against the [Bosnian] Croats. 
  [Tudjman] Yes, this is a paradox. I spoke about this on many 
occasions with Izetbegovic and Silajdzic. I spoke about it at 
the European conference on Bosnia. I said that it costs us 
dearly; this situation in which we provide shelter for Muslims 
here [in Croatia], we provide education for their children while 
at the same time Croats are being killed there [in central 
Bosnia]. I explained that this cannot be tolerated and that we 
can hardly control the justified anger of the Croatian people. 
Unfortunately even these arguments failed to persuade the 
Muslim leadership to end the aggression. They accepted the 
Christmas truce; but they continued the aggression. They also 
attacked the White Path humanitarian convoy. However this 
convoy, led by Slobodan Lang, helped to make the world see, even 
those people who do not support us, I mean that part of the 
world which now wants to lift the sanctions against Serbia, to 
shift the responsibility for the situation in Bosnia on Croatia 
too [as received]. With the example of the White Path convoy 
[Croatian aid for central Bosnia, attacked by Muslims] the world 
realized what is it all about: that the Muslims are truly using 
violent means, that they did not allow doctors to enter Nova 
Bila, and that the doctors came under attack. This showed that 
the Muslims are now carrying out a genocide against Croats. 
  All this has created a situation where either the Muslims 
will abandon this policy or the world will have to understand 
the steps that we will have to take to defend the Croatian 
people there [in Bosnia] and for possible steps that we will 
have to take in relation to the Muslim refugees in Croatia. 
  [Correspondent] Is Islamic fundamentalism at work in Bosnia, 
a viewer from Pula asks. 
  [Tudjman] Of course, to a certain extent it is. You can find 
mojahedin there, from various Islamic countries and from Sandzak 
[Muslim populated area in Yugoslavia]. We have also received 
alarming reports about efforts to establish an Islamic state, 
about songs being sung such as: From Istanbul to Trieste There 
Will Not Be Any Christians. It is also worrying that this 
Muslim [Izetbegovic] leadership has begun a war against those 
Muslims who really support friendly relations with Croatia. 
Many Muslims feel like this; it is not just Fikret Abdic in 
Western Bosnia or Cazin Krajina. Hadziosmanovic, Pohara [Muslim 
leaders loyal to Fikret Abdic], Zulfo Robovic, who is a member 
of the [Herceg-Bosna] government, and others also belong to this 
group. Many Muslims are like this but they do not have the kind 
of influence on Bosnian politics that Izetbegovic, Silajdzic, 
Ganic, and others have. 
  [Correspondent] A viewer from Zagreb asks where the Muslims 
got their weapons. 
  [Tudjman] The Muslims partly control military factories in 
Bosnia. Above all, we also gave them weapons at the beginning 
when we fought jointly against the Serb aggressor; we also gave 
them weapons. They also armed themselves by using humanitarian 
convoys [to smuggle weapons]. We have also received reports 
that they have been giving large sums of money, as they say fat 
wads of dollars, to buy weapons from the Serbs. They even rent 
[Serb] tanks to use them against the Croats. So this is a 
chaotic situation in which not only common interests and 
contradictions are intertwined but also in certain areas local 
commanders are creating various and sometimes even hellish 
situations. 
  [Correspondent] We have quite a few questions from our 
viewers which are identical to those that we were planning to 
ask. For instance, a Zlatko from Zagreb is asking you, and this 
is what I was planning to ask you, whether Croatia is planning 
to further the process of privatization. This is also linked to 
the fact that we have all noticed that the influx of foreign 
capital into Croatia has been insufficient. Can some changes to 
the process of privatization be expected in this regard? 
  [Tudjman] The problem of privatization in all former 
socialist countries is a very complex problem. However, Croatia 
has made a huge step also in that respect. Today we have got 
around 79,000 private enterprises. With reference to foreign 
investments last year and this year: last year there were 2,187 
foreign investments and opening of foreign enterprises, I think. 
This year some more 1,000 to 1,100 independent or mixed 
enterprises were opened. Last year more than 600,000,000 German 
Marks was invested either in the form of direct capital or in 
the form of machinery. This year around $300 million was 
invested. This means that privatization is going ahead and that 
despite the war foreign business circles have got trust in 
Croatia; capital is steadily flowing into Croatia. 
  Another thing in connection with privatization: private 
enterprises employing up to 200 workers earn around 35 per cent 
of the income. That process which is very complex and 
convoluted is going on, and obviously, once the war situation is 
over it will undergo a turnabout, gain a momentum; there are 
foreign studies saying that Croatia will be of the most 
prosperous countries, particularly in the light of results that 
the Croatian Government has achieved in slashing inflation, 
which was met by almost disbelief in the world, and by the most 
serious financial circles, such as IMF, the World Bank and other 
business circles: how did we succeed to [slash] this inflation 
which was inherited in Croatia from former Yugoslavia. 
  Having taken over the power in spring, in May 1990, we 
inherited huge inflation which was 45.8 percent -- it was 46 
percent back in January 1990. 
  Despite the war and all the plight caused by the war, 
declining production, destruction of industrial facilities, we 
succeeded in reducing it. However, this year [1993], right up 
to September, it nevertheless fluctuated from between 25 and 28 
percent. And now Valentic's government and steps we have 
taken--if you remember in March this year, in my speech in the 
Assembly, I outlined the program of economic revival and 
forecast our economic revival and a fall in inflation as 
precondition for making national currency convertible. The 
previous government of Prime Minister Sarinic drew up a 
stabilization program, Valentic's government took it over and 
took efficient and effective steps which helped us to reduce the 
inflation from 38 per cent to 1.4 percent in November. During 
the current month of December the inflation has been slashed, we 
even have a negative inflation of minus zero percent [as 
received]. The world is absolutely amazed at this and this has 
created foundations for implementing our plan for introducing 
convertible national currency next year on Statehood Day. 
  Allow me to say in this context that even the most competent 
international experts, theoreticians and those who apply it in 
practice, for instance I have an opportunity to talk to such 
people as deputy in a company such as Ford responsible for the 
entire Eastern Europe who told me that he had been in all those 
countries, Poland, the Czech republic, Hungary, Slovakia, 
Russia, Ukraine, and he told me: I was amazed at how you in 
Croatia, I thought there was war in Croatia but what I found is 
the situation better than in any other country except perhaps 
the Czech Republic. Or in our talks here with Professor 
Dihibuchi, he is an expert of international reputation who 
played the most important role in bringing economic stability in 
Chile, on his mother's side he is a Croat but born there--and he 
said, what you have done--and not only he, others have also said 
it--you were able to achieve this because you knew what you 
wanted, because you had the right leadership. This is possible 
only in the countries with the majority government and with a 
leadership that knows what it wants. And where the situation is 
not like in Croatia--he cited the examples of Poland and others 
-- where there is no such leadership and where coalition 
governments are in power that argue over what to do--there will 
be no results in the economic sphere. 
  In other words, as far as the world is concerned, in this 
sphere too we succeeded in achieving a miracle. Of course, all 
problems have not been solved. We are yet to expect a great 
deal of sweat, of effort in both the process of privatization 
and in restructuring, in general, and the transformation of the 
socialist system but we should be more than satisfied with the 
results achieved so far. 
  [Correspondent] Does this include the problem of 
denationalization? 
  [Tudjman] Absolutely! At one of the meetings of the National 
Security Council I announced that I personally will ask both the 
Assembly and the government to begin to tackle the problem of 
denationalization in a more effective way. In other words, I 
shall ask them to pass the law on denationalization despite the 
fact that the experience from other countries shows that this is 
a very complicated process which cannot be approached in a 
simplified way. We must not make mistakes that would be greater 
than the ones we are trying to rectify. We must not jeopardize 
the current level of production, etc. In other words, this is 
something that foreign citizens, foreign countries also [?face]. 
This is a very complex issue but we must approach it primarily 
by passing relevant law and in practice by denationalizing 
wherever possible or by providing relevant compensation. 
  [Correspondent] A question on internal policy. Some have 
criticized us for the violation of human rights mentioning the 
destruction of Serbian houses, eviction of Serbs from their 
flats. It is sufficient to mention the village of Cicak. Are 
these only exceptions or is it our big guilt as some people have 
put it? 
  [Tudjman] These are neither exceptions nor guilt. These are 
results and consequences of an aggressive war that was imposed 
on Croatia. In such a war, which assumed characteristics of a 
life and death struggle in some areas, obviously despite all our 
efforts to prevent lawlessness we could not achieve that. This 
could not be achieved by any country in any war. From the 
Americans in Vietnam, the French in Algiers, you can see what is 
happening after the Jews in Israel and Palestinians reached the 
agreement, what is happening in Northern Island. 
  As long as the war situation is continuing some anarchic 
phenomena cannot be avoided. It is completely certain that we 
have demanded the observance of human rights, no vengeful 
actions should be allowed, and people should be called to 
account. It is completely certain that as regards human rights 
and freedom of media under war conditions we permitted some even 
anarchic phenomena to take place, which no state, even under 
more favorable conditions would permit. 
  There have been such phenomena. We will do everything to 
eliminate them and those who perpetrated them should be called 
to account, particularly if some robberies have taken place. 
However, it is important to say that this happened during the 
war on the territory of Croatia under the conditions when 300 
[figure as heard] Croatian people were not only evicted from 
their homes but also were forced to watch crimes from Vukovar to 
Skabrnja; the killing of their relatives, women, children, 
elderly people; and that this created a situation whereby all 
our attempts to prevent phenomena that are abnormal have not 
been effective so far. However, we will do everything on our 
part for Croatia to be a law-governed state and to prevent such 
phenomena. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, you probably know that the 
citizens of Croatia who live in the UNPA zones are watching us. 
What do you think the people in the media and you people in 
politics.... [pauses] how should we best establish contact with 
them? 
  [Tudjman] I am glad you have asked this question so that I 
might say to you that really one significant part of this common 
people from Knin to Baranja has beed deluded. They have been 
deceived along the lines.... [pauses] Here we have some ustashas 
who have come to power who have no other task than to kill you. 
So there are a small number of these Serbian extremists who 
have been nurtured on [this propaganda] and are doing everything 
to unify these areas with a greater Serbia. 
  People who have had negotiations with the Serbs from all 
these areas -- from Knin to western Slavonia and so on -- have 
told me how these people were amazed when they were told that 
the Serbs were living normally in Zagreb and other areas; what 
was it that we were offering them? Slavko Degoricija has had a 
series of talks with these and other people. So this ordinary 
Serb in Knin is being deluded. 
  The task for you in radio and television, as well, in a 
technical sense -- we set ourselves such a task -- is to 
establish possibilities for us to be heard so that the truth 
about Croatia might emerge, [and so that the Serbs might learn] 
what we are offering them, and that this is in their interest, 
so that they might find a way out of this [word indistinct] 
situation and the terror that is being perpetrated by those who 
are even imprisoning those people who are normal and who want a 
political solution [sentence as heard]. 
  You should to a greater extent include in your radio and 
television broadcasts topics on this normalization of relations 
in Croatia and guide Serbs who know the situation and know what 
we want sincerely for the sake of Croatia and the Croatian 
people and Serbs in Croatia and for the sake of the 
normalization of relations about which I spoke in this 
conversation when I referred to the normalization of relations 
between Croatia and Serbia for the sake of the world and peace 
and for the sake of international order. 
  [Correspondent] Experienced diplomats have said that what we 
do not expect always happens. Precisely for that reason, do 
heads of state have the right to fear? Are you afraid sometimes? 
  [Tudjman] No. [long pause] I am a man who steeps himself in 
living history, who takes part in history, and in creating this 
history, if I can say so. From my early youth, as a 
ten-year-old boy I took part in carrying messages during the 6 
January dictatorship [dictatorship imposed on 6 January 1929 by 
Yugoslav King Aleksandar Karadjordjevic] when people were 
imprisoned and even killed for it. My father introduced me to 
that. 
  However, by analyzing history I have come to the conclusion 
that if someone is a head of state he has to be ready to do what 
is in the interest of the people. I will give you an example: 
On 24 January 1991 a session of the then Yugoslav presidency in 
Belgrade was convened. We were in the [Croatian] Assembly. A 
vast majority of my closest associates and deputies to the 
assembly told me not to go, that I would be assassinated. I 
went, being aware that it was necessary for me to go, regardless 
of what happened to me. If I had not gone to Belgrade then, the 
army machinery of the Yugoslav People's Army would have been 
moved to carry out an all-out attack on Croatia. The Croatian 
Government would have been toppled. Hence, we would not have had 
democratic Croatia. So, I was ready and aware what could happen 
to me, what happened to Radic [Stjepan Radic, a Croatian deputy, 
was shot dead in the Yugoslav Assembly in 1928]. However, 
courage is to do what has to be done in the interest of the 
people when you are at the head of a people's movement or a 
state. 
  [Correspondent] At that time many were against your decision 
to travel to Belgrade. Now when these talks end, certain 
documents are signed and certain decisions are made. Many 
people say you should not have done it that way, you could have 
done it this way, you could have done it in a better way, and so 
on. To what extent are you personally affected by criticism? 
  [Tudjman] Well, you know, human stupidity has never been 
dear 
to me [laughs]. Nevertheless, I have confidence both in my own 
judgement and in the fact that people are following not only my 
programme but -- I can cite a thousand examples of how people 
from all strata, from ordinary women and schoolchildren to 
university professors -- and they have said to me personally and 
written to me saying how they spontaneously sensed that what I 
am implementing is what they, too, want [sentence as heard]. 
  Several days ago a local official visited me and said 
something along the lines of: I travelled a long way and came 
home and said to my old mother, you know what, mother, I am now 
with the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union], and then she replied 
-- to cut the story short -- Thank God, son, you are not 
separate from the people [Tudjman laughs]. 
  I think there are in what we have achieved... [pauses] we 
have achieved a national-democratic rebirth of the Croatian 
nation and most people, regardless of political differences, 
live for this freedom and democracy in Croatian that we have 
created. This gives me the basis for being sure of my actions. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, all of us have some kind of 
expectations of Croatia. If you want to get something from 
Croatia you have to give something, too. So you should, 
therefore, love Croatia. In your opinion what is the best way 
to love Croatia? 
  [Tudjman] To do everything you can for Croatia, for your own 
satisfaction, for your families and for the satisfaction of the 
people and in the interests of the people. 
  [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] a question of a personal 
nature. What is it like to be head of state? 
  [Tudjman] Perhaps you will not believe me when I tell you I 
did not want to be a politician. I wanted to be an academic. I 
wanted.... [pauses] I have, I think, three or four books, which 
will be of significance not only in Croatia but also in world 
literature -- from my "Rat Protiv Rata" [War Against War] to 
"Velike Ideje I Male Narode" [Great Ideas and Small Nations] and 
"Nacionalno Pitanje u Evropi" [The National Question in Europe], 
in which I predicted these events, and "Bespuca" [Wasteland]. I 
have two manuscripts that I would be happier to finish and 
publish than anything else. 
  I am probably somewhat to blame for this freedom and 
sovereignty of Croatia, but personally I am a slave of Croatia 
-- from dawn to dusk [laughs]. However, that is how it is. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, you have made predictions -- 
we think your prognoses are valuable. What do you expect of 
1994? 
  [Tudjman] You never need to predict things when you have 
your 
judgments and assessments, but I believe that in 1994 we will 
achieve the incorporation into Croatia of Croatian territory 
under Serbian occupation or under the protection of peacekeeping 
forces. I believe that the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina will end 
and that in this way the Croatian state, the Croatian people, 
and all the citizens of Croatia will have the final 
preconditions for a peaceful life and normal development. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, finally, you are at the 
moment 
in the homes of all Croatian citizens. What would you like to 
tell them? 
  [Tudjman] Have confidence in yourselves -- each Croatian 
person in himself or herself -- and in your own people. And 
bring up your children to be decent people in the service of 
their own people, to the benefit of their families and their 
state, because the state is the home for the whole people, as an 
apartment or house is a home for the family. I believe that 
this people -- the Croatian people -- have something to be proud 
of. We have realized our freedom and democracy -- people have 
fallen in battle for centuries to achieve this -- and we should 
not miss this opportunity or bring into question in any way the 
very thing that we have realized. As a result, if I am in the 
homes of Croatian -- not only Croatian people, but all citizens 
of Croatia -- prove to me that we have been worthy of this 
freedom and of our state.

  [Text] Next week NATO will openly reiterate the openness 
of the alliance to new members and the fact that no country has 
a right of veto on this issue, Foreign Minister Andrzej 
Olechowski said at Warsaw Okecie airport yesterday after his 
return from a one-day visit to Germany. His talks with German 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel were extended from the planned 15 
minutes to one hour. They concerned primarily the NATO summit, 
which will be held in Brussels on 10 January. 
  [Begin Olechowski recording] Our conversation convinced me 
to 
a great extent that the Germans are supporters of the gradual 
inclusion of Poland and Central European countries in the 
European security structures. Mr. Kinkel kindly said that 
Germany will be an advocate of Polish interests at the NATO 
summit. This will not be the first time because we have noted, 
and we often emphasize this, that Germany is the country which 
has been supporting in a consistent and solid manner Polish 
demands and aspirations concerning Western Europe, or to put it 
more broadly, Western institutions. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Jiri Skalicky, minister for the </F>
administration and privatization of national property, by Olga 
Skalkova; place and date not given: "Most of the Property Will 
be Privatized Before the End of This Electoral Term"] 
  [Excerpts] [Skalkova] In the near future, the definitive 
list of the enterprises offered in the second and the last wave 
of coupon privatization will be published, and this will close 
an important stage in the transformation of the economy. How 
much state property has been privatized so far, how much is left 
to be privatized, and what is the share of the private sector in 
the generation of the gross national product? 
  [Skalicky] These questions are very difficult to answer in 
precise figures. The problem is that we neither know the exact 
value of the property that remains in the hands of the state, 
nor do we have precise numbers on the property already 
transferred to private hands in the framework of restitutions. 
We only know that more than 100,000 real estate properties have 
been returned, for instance, in the framework of the small-scale 
restitution on the level of enterprise-authorized persons. 
Another property transfer took place by means of the so-called 
small-scale privatization that is to end with this year. It was 
an insignificant amount from the point of view of the entire 
process of denationalization -- the book value lies somewhere 
between 20 and 25 billion korunas, the yield is approximately 33 
billion korunas. 
  Practically all the property that had been registered in 
time 
was included in the large-scale privatization. The book value 
of the property that entered the two privatization waves 
totalled about 1.2 to 1.3 billion korunas. Some of the 
enterprises on the list ended in bankruptcy and liquidation even 
before the privatization projects were submitted and assessed. 
  The value of the property being privatized is lower by this 
amount. We do not precisely know the book value of the property 
that, as decided, will not be privatized for five years, and the 
same applies to the property that is to remain in public or 
state ownership. [passage omitted] 
  Much more important than the value of the property in the 
state or private hands is, however, the data on the development 
of the share of the private sector in the generation national 
product. It has already reached 57 percent, which indicates 
even more favorable development than corresponds to the real 
pace of privatization. Namely, private firms not only emerge 
from privatization but also on "green sites." 
  [Skalkova] Can you at least give the ratio between the state 
property privatized for remuneration and the share of property 
for which the state does not collect any financial means? 
  [Skalicky] The property transferred free of charge in the 
form of the coupon privatization is estimated at 400 to 450 
billion korunas. Another significant share of the property -- 
about 60 to 100 billion korunas -- was transferred to 
communities in the form of shares of certain enterprises that 
represent environmentally, for instance, a burden on the region 
or are of key importance for its infrastructure. 
  The value of property that has been sold directly or in the 
form of shares to domestic or foreign investors -- or the sale 
of which has been decided -- amounts to only 200 to 250 billion 
korunas. That is a surprisingly low amount if we compare it with 
the value of the property transferred free of charge. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Skalkova] How do you foresee the development in investment 
funds? 
  [Skalicky] They will go basically in two directions. A part 
of the funds will tend to the role of the traditional 
institutional investor, i.e. stabilize its average proceeds by a 
broad portfolio. These funds will not have any ambitions of an 
influential owner. The other part of the funds -- and I put my 
hope with respect to the influence exertion on the enterprises 
in these funds -- will limit the diversity of the portfolio to a 
special sector or a group of enterprises. Therefore, in the 
future, we will have to consider the abolition of the 20 percent 
limit to the capital participation of these funds in 
stockholding companies. [passage omitted] 
  [Skalkova] Lately, the share of foreign investments seems to 
be ceding to the portfolio investments, but this type of capital 
does not bring any know-how or new technology, which the 
enterprises need to be competitive. What, in your opinion, is 
the contribution of such privatization? 
  [Skalicky] I would not underestimate this type of 
privatization, because the foreign investor must have decided 
for it in order to influence the enterprise. The only thing is 
that this form is less obvious and -- similarly to investments 
in enterprises made prior or after the privatization -- 
manifests itself only gradually. I actually consider this trend 
desirable because now, when the conditions for normal 
development of the economy have been created, we definitely need 
foreign capital. One of the greatest current problems are the 
excessively expensive credits. The portfolio investments, 
however, are not a part of the privatization process but rather 
-- and I insist -- a beneficial result of the gradual 
privatization. They certainly would not enter anonymous state 
enterprises in the same scope. [passage omitted] 
  [Skalkova] What will the privatization process be like after 
the second wave of privatization is completed? 
  [Skalicky] I would characterize this period by saying that 
it will be the post-privatization cleanup. We want the founding 
sectors to now submit a list of property for additional small 
privatization waves. We are going to collaborate on a similar 
task with the district offices. There is also some state 
property established by the communities. We intend to involve 
the district privatization commissions in the search for the 
unattached property. There will not be much, but some will 
certainly be found. [passage omitted] 
  There is a relatively broad scale of methods at our 
disposal, 
so the privatization process can reach its end as quickly as 
possible. It should happen before the end of this electoral term.

<F P=106> [Report by Elisa Wasch] </F>
  [Excerpt] [Announcer] In Vienna talks about Bosnia have 
started today again, for the second time in three weeks. The 
meeting between Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and 
Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic will deal mainly with 
territorial issues. Elisa Wasch reports on the negotiations. 
  [Wasch] Both sides today stressed that they finally want to 
put an end to the fighting in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Over the past 
months, the Muslim government units in central Bosnia managed to 
conquer six towns; about 70,000 Croats are surrounded there. As 
a result, over the past days threats have come from Zagreb. 
Both President Tudjman and Defense Minister Susak spoke of a 
potential Croatian military intervention in Bosnia if the 
Muslims do not cease their offensive. Croatian Foreign Minister 
Mate Granic, who participated in today's talks, denies that 
there are any plans for a Croatian intervention. 
  [Begin Granic recording, in English with superimposed German 
translation] We do not have any plan to make a military 
intervention. We will talk about how we can put an end to the 
fighting, about a cease-fire, and about future relations between 
Croats and Muslims. [end recording] 
  In addition, Granic said that Croatia continues to be 
willing 
to negotiate access to the Adriatic Sea, which is demanded by 
the Muslims. However, Zagreb no longer wants to talk about the 
Adriatic port of Neum, which the Muslims want to have. 
  [Being Granic recording] Croatia is ready to discuss access 
to the sea but not Neum. [end recording] 
  The Vienna talks are still going on and will be continued 
tomorrow. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The first round of Croatian-Muslim negotiations on 
the peaceful resolution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict ended 
in Vienna late this afternoon. The most important topics were 
the cessation of the Croat-Muslim conflict, sending humanitarian 
aid, and the problem of territorial settlement between the 
Croatian and Muslim communities in Bosnia-Herzegovina. An 
agreement has been reached that in the next two years Mostar 
should be administered by the European Union. 
  The heads of delegations, [Croatian Foreign Minister] Mate 
Granic and [Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister] Haris Silajdzic, 
also met peace negotiators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg. 
Negotiations are to be resumed tomorrow. 
  A good start in Vienna: a principled readiness for peace, 
and 
the free dispatch of humanitarian aid to all. At one-hour 
tete-a-tete talks held behind closed doors, the envoys for 
President Tudjman and President Izetbegovic set the agenda for 
the talks, and then all members of the delegations entered the 
conference hall in Vienna's Hofburg Palace. The Muslim side 
expressed its principled readiness for a complete cease-fire. 
This is a preparatory meeting for Geneva, with envoys being in 
permanent consultations with Zagreb and Sarajevo. 
  [Begin Granic recording] We spent most of the time on 
cease-fire talks and future Croatian-Muslim relations. [end 
recording] 
  They spoke about the main issues -- securing aid for the 
entire population, Croatians and Muslims, securing freedom of 
movement for aid convoys. They also discussed the completion of 
POW exchanges based on the all-for-all principle, whereby the 
Croatians have so far done more. Topic number one was a 
cease-fire and the cessation of all hostilities. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Has a step 
been made toward peace, in central Bosnia for instance? 
  [Silajdzic] We will continue to discuss that issue tomorrow. 
You must understand that in light of our past experience, I 
speak with slight reservations about global and final solutions. 
I can tell you that my impression is that there is a great deal 
of goodwill on both sides and that is a good start. 
  [Correspondent] The issue of sea access was raised and will 
continue to be discussed. Croatia's positions on this issue are 
firm. Reference is being made to the lines of demarcation within 
a union of the Bosnia-Herzegovina republics. 
  [Granic] Some progress has been made with regard to 
humanitarian issues. Talks about all other issues will resume 
tomorrow. 
  [Correspondent] The atmosphere at the talks reflects the 
difficult situation in the field, where Muslims cannot benefit 
any further from continuing their war against the Croats. 
Although all issues were touched upon today, a general 
agreement is no nearer. 
  [Granic] This is a preparatory meeting before Geneva, even 
much more in view of the situation in central Bosnia. 
  [Silajdzic] The atmosphere can be described as constructive. 
Today we discussed humanitarian convoys, and I think we agreed 
to hold a meeting shortly to agree on continuing sending fresh 
convoys, desperately awaited by the population of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  We also discussed Mostar. We, of course, agreed that the 
European Union would administer Mostar over two years or even 
less, depending on what we agree. I can also say that I am very 
pleased with the fact that both sides accept the idea of Mostar 
for the people of Mostar [Mostar Mostarcima], in other words the 
return of all the people of Mostar to their town. [end 
recording] 
  Croatians accept this idea of Mostar's status, providing it 
implies the departure of those who are not from Mostar, who came 
from elsewhere, of Muslim newcomers. Negotiations in Vienna are 
continuing.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic by </F>
Elmar Oberhauser in Vienna; Silajdzic speaks in Serbo-Croation 
with simultaneous German translation -- live] 
  [Text] [Oberhauser] I welcome Bosnian Prime Minister 
Haris Silajdzic here in our studio. Good evening. 
  [Silajdzic] Good evening. 
  [Oberhauser] Mr. Silajdzic, there is probably no sensible 
person who understands this war in your country, which has, as 
we have heard, claimed 140,000 lives and has brought incredible 
suffering, above all to the civilian population. Do you 
understand it? 
  [Silajdzic] Yes, absolutely. It is the result of the 
expansionist policy by the Belgrade government and the passivity 
of the international community. You have just seen [in a 
previous report] the scenes in Sarajevo. This has been going on 
for two years in Sarajevo, but also in other towns, such as 
Vukovar, where it started. The international community has not 
only done nothing, but has prohibited our defending ourselves. 
With that the international community has condemned Bosnia to 
death. I think this has to come to an end. 
  There are only two solutions: Either the international 
community intervenes -- this time on our side and not on the 
side of the aggressor, because we have an embargo on military 
equipment -- or it will permit us to defend ourselves. 
  [Oberhauser] Mr. Prime Minister, I do not want to -- and I 
cannot do it, anyway -- play arbiter here, but do you not make 
things a bit too easy for yourself? Even though this embargo 
exists, your soldiers are advancing and are involved in the 
fighting pretty heavily. 
  [Silajdzic] We have light military equipment and the things 
that we have assembled ourselves. It is a shame for Europe that 
we are forced to fight against hundreds of tanks with weapons 
that we have made ourselves. We are advancing because we are 
defending our very lives. This is a question of life or death 
for us. 
  [Oberhauser] This intervention from outside that you have 
just mentioned -- is this the only possibility to put an end to 
the war? 
  [Silajdzic] The international community must respect its own 
resolutions and the basic principles of the civilized world. 
According to these, it must either intervene or permit us to 
defend ourselves. Our hands are tied. If no diplomatic 
solution can be found, only these two solutions are left. 
  [Oberhauser] If this is true, Mr. Prime Minister, what is 
then the point of negotiations, such as the ones that are 
currently being held in Vienna? I do not even know how many 
have already been held. 
  [Silajdzic] These are talks between Bosnia and Croatia, 
between the Bosnians and the Croats. They are currently in 
conflict, but they are in conflict because the international 
community has not stopped the aggression against Bosnia. This 
is one result of the aggression. 
  [Oberhauser] What do you expect of the Vienna talks? What 
can the results be? 
  [Silajdzic] Today we talked about humanitarian issues; we 
have already made some progress in this field. Today we also 
discussed the status of the town of Mostar, and I can tell you 
with joy that we have come to an agreement, that the Croatian 
side is also supporting the project of giving Mostar to the 
inhabitants of Mostar. This means that all those who have been 
driven away from Mostar may return to Mostar. This means that 
this is a victory of civilization over barbarism. Those who 
destroyed the Old Bridge do not belong there. Unfortunately, 
many will not return because they are dead. The least we can do 
as a debt to our civilization is to bring the people in this 
town back to their houses. 
  [Oberhauser] No matter how much we discuss tactical issues 
here, I do not assume that we would make any progress in this 
respect. Let us talk a bit about the people in your country. 
You have talked about humanitarian aid. In the West, we have 
heard that hundreds of thousands are threatened with death this 
winter, because they will starve or freeze. Is there a 
possibility to help these people? What is the situation? 
  [Silajdzic] There are possibilities. In Geneva we have 
agreed that humanitarian goods may pass. The UN forces have 
also been given the mandate to fight against those who stop 
these convoys. This mandate is not being exercised. Therefore, 
the convoys do not get through or they arrive too late. The 
entire problem in Bosnia-Herzegovina is the attempt to stop the 
aggression with words. 
  [Oberhauser] Does that mean that the UN soldiers in your 
country do not fulfill their task? Do you mean that? 
  [Silajdzic] I think they have not been given any orders at 
all. 
  [Oberhauser] Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for being our 
guest. I hope that, despite the hopelessness that is conveyed 
by your words, at some time in the future it will be possible to 
put an end to this madness. Shortly before we started our talk, 
I received a press agency report saying that French Defense 
Minister Leotard today came out in favor of U.S. intervention in 
the Balkans. He wants to present this wish at the NATO summit 
in Brussels next week. Would you welcome that? 
  [Silajdzic] It means that Europe's conscience is not 
completely dead. 
  [Oberhauser] Once again, thank you and I hope that your 
people will soon have the situation that they desire. Thank you.

  [Text] Vienna, Jan 5 (AFP) -- The Croatian delegation at 
bilateral talks here with Bosnian leaders said an "important" 
announcement would be made at midday, as talks resumed after 
failing to reach a cease-fire agreement Tuesday [4 January]. 
The Croat delegation said the announcement would be made at 
noon (1100 GMT), on the second day of discussions in the old 
imperial palace at Hofburg. The talks were expected to focus on 
a ceasefire, internal borders and access to the sea for the 
Bosnian Moslems. 
  The Vienna-based U.S. ambassador to Bosnia-Hercegovina, 
Victor Jakovich, was at Wednesday's opening of the talks, but 
the international mediators Lord Owen for the European Community 
and Thorvald Stoltenberg for the UN, who attended on Tuesday, 
were not present. 
  The two delegation chiefs, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris 
Silajdzic and Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic, both 
described their discussions on Tuesday afternoon as 
"constructive." They said "real progress" had been made on the 
passage of humanitarian convoys and prisoner swaps. 
  Silajdzic also said he was "encouraged" by a Craotian pledge 
supported Bosnian proposals to allow residents of Mostar, a 
southern Bosnian city hit hard by the ethnic conflict, to return 
home. The talks here follow a recent escalation of fighting 
between mainly Moslem Bosnian and Bosnian Croat forces in 
central Bosnia.

  [Text] London, Jan 5 (AFP) -- Croatian Foreign Minister 
Mate Granic on Wednesday [5 January] denied assertions by EC 
mediator David Owen that regular Croatian troops were stationed 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but acknowledged the presence of 
"volunteers." "There are some volunteers from Croatia, 
definitely, but not regular Croatian forces," Granic told BBC 
Radio. 
  Owen, in a Channel 4 Television interview to be aired 
Wednesday night, said, "We all know there is as I speak a very 
substantial element of the Croatian army in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
very substantial. 
  "And I must say that I think it's an issue that the world 
ought to address more strongly," Owen said. "They addressed it 
in terms of the Serbs in the spring of 1992 with very 
considerable strength of purpose, but they have to a great 
extent ignored it in the last six months as it's built up." 
  Owen said the EC view was "obviously influenced" by Germany 
and "other friends of Croatia like Austria in the United 
Nations, Hungary and others, and the United States". 
  "The general feeling," he said, "has been that it is better 
to make representations to (Croatian) President (Franjo) Tudjman 
and to criticize and to argue rather than to take action in 
terms of sanctions against Croatia." 
  Croatia has always denied it has regular troops stationed in 
Bosnia, although Tudjman on December 30 warned he would 
intervene on the side of Bosnian Croats who, he said, faced 
"aggression" by the Moslem-dominated Bosnian army. 
  Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic meanwhile Wednesday 
denied the existence of a Bosnian offensive against Croat 
enclaves, telling BBC Radio, "The Bosnian Army is on Bosnian 
soil, there is no doubt about it. That is not an offensive."

  [Excerpt] Sarajevo, Jan 4 (AFP) -- The Sarajevo-based 
Belgian general in charge of UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina is 
to be withdrawn, Brussels said Tuesday, amid outspoken 
complaints by him and other top peacekeepers over their 
powerlessness to intervene in the war. Lieutenant-General 
Francis Briquemont was due to end his term as military commander 
in Bosnia in July but Belgium said Tuesday it wanted to recall 
him, a move that was immediately condemned by a top Bosnian 
government official. 
  A Belgian defence ministry official said Briquemont had 
agreed to return and would resume a post in his country's forces 
in Germany after leaving Bosnia before the end of January. 
  In New York, a spokesman for UN Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali said the UN would not be perturbed by Briquemont's 
early departure from his post. "If he wants to be relieved, he 
will be relieved," said Ahmad Fawzi. Briquemont was in Zagreb 
on a visit and did not comment on his plans. 
  Briquemont has been increasingly critical of the UN's 
inability to protect civilians and stop attacks on aid convoys, 
a point echoed by the UN Commander in the former Yugoslavia 
General Jean Cot, who complained Monday of humiliations suffered 
by international peacekeepers. Cot also said that UN troops 
were ready for an "offensive intervention" in Bosnia. 
  Ejup Ganic, the number two to Bosnian President Alija 
Izetbegovic, said Belgium's decision showed that the 
international community was not taking the crisis in his country 
seriously. Ganic said that personally he felt that as soon as a 
UN military official got to grips with the situation, he was 
replaced. 
  French General Philippe Morillon, Briquemont's predecessor, 
was also recalled and had also been outspoken in his criticism 
of the inadequacy of international intervention in the stricken 
country. 
  Briquemont recently demanded reinforcement of the 12,000 
strong UN Protection Force contingent in Bosnia and said that he 
no longer bothered to read unheeded UN resolutions on the civil 
war. 
  Ganic hinted that the recall might be to do with his 
criticisms of a peace plan dividing the country. He noted that 
Briquemont, like Morillon, had expressed the view that the 
partition of the country between the three warring groups was 
not a solution. 
  Belgian diplomats said they hoped that Briquemont's 
replacement would also be Belgian but the appointment rests in 
the hands of Butrus-Ghali. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Geneva, Jan 4 (AFP) -- Bosnian peace negotiations 
will resume on January 18 in Geneva, three days later than 
expected, UN spokeswoman Therese Gastaut announced Tuesday. She 
said the talks were put back at the request of Geneva security 
officials. 
  Geneva police will be mobilized on January 15 and 16 because 
of the scheduled summit there between U.S. President Bill 
Clinton and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad to try to further 
efforts to reach an Arab-Israeli peace. 
  The Bosnian peace talks will be held with leaders from the 
republic's three warring factions -- Moslems, Croats and Serbs 
-- as well as the presidents of Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro. 
The peace talks broke off on December 23 amid Bosnian Moslem 
demands for more land concessions. 
  Bilateral Bosnian-Croatian talks were held Tuesday in Vienna 
between Bosnia's Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and Croatia's 
Foreign Minister Mate Granic in the presence of mediators of the 
international peace conference on ex-Yugoslavia, Lord Owen for 
the European Community and Thorvald Stoltenberg for the United 
Nations. 
  The two said as they entered talks they hoped to reach a 
ceasefire agreement, amid a rise in fighting between Moslem and 
Croat troops in central Bosnia.

  [Excerpt] The highest representatives of the Visegrad Group 
are to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton in Prague. Experts from 
the ministries of foreign affairs of the four today concluded 
all the arrangements for the event in the capital of the Czech 
Republic. Defense ministers of the Visegrad Group will meet in 
Warsaw on Friday. There will be no more higher level 
consultations before the Prague meeting with Clinton. 
  Budapest had different ideas about the preparations for the 
U.S.-Visegrad summit, but acknowledged the will of the Czech 
hosts. On the line from Budapest is our reporter Gregor Martin 
Papucsek with more details: 
  [Papucsek] Hungarian President Arpad Goncz and his Polish 
counterpart, Lech Walesa, jointly proposed to Czech Prime 
Minister Vaclav Klaus during the funeral of Jozsef Antall in 
Budapest that the states of the Visegrad Group coordinate their 
positions before meeting Bill Clinton. However, Budapest now 
notes with a degree of regret that Prague refused to form a 
joint platform. Observers point to the fact that Czech politics 
views Visegrad cooperation rather skeptically and decisively 
rejects all attempts which may lead to institutionalizing 
Visegrad Group activity. 
  It is also observed in Budapest that the Czech 
representatives have tried from the beginning to emphasize the 
Czech-U.S. bilateral features of Bill Clinton's visit to Prague.

  [Excerpts] Only bilateral meetings will take place at the 
Prague meeting of the Visegrad countries heads of states and the 
American President. Ivan Baba, deputy foreign affairs state 
secretary, said regarding his talks in the Czech Republic today 
that the Visegrad countries did not form a joint position prior 
to the meeting. Peter Nyaradi reports from Prague. 
  [Nyaradi] Today's meeting had more of a technical than 
political nature, Ivan Baba, deputy state secretary for foreign 
affairs, said in Prague. [passage omitted] 
  After meeting Clinton, the Hungarian delegation will 
separate 
into three parties and everybody will meet their Czech 
counterpart; that is, Arpad Goncz will meet President Havel in

omitted] 
  In reply to a question from Hungarian Radio on whether there 
is any chance for political coordination of any kind between the 
leaders of the Visegrad four, and whether they were able to 
agree about this today, Ivan Baba said the following: 
  [Begin Baba recording] No agreement was reached about 
political coordination. We agreed that they will (?try) to 
coordinate their positions on [words indistinct] channels about 
individual questions, and we already know that there will be a 
meeting of defense ministers in Warsaw on 7 January. This can 
also be considered as some kind of coordination. [end recording]

  [Text] A great stir was created by President's Clinton's 
alleged proposal yesterday that the armies of Hungary and the 
other east-central European countries should carry out their 
international military cooperation within the framework of the 
so-called Partnership for Peace movement, and for the time being 
they should not consider NATO as their future partner. 
"Newsreel" first asked the opinion of [Defense Minister] Lajos 
Fur. 
  [Begin Fur recording] A very important statement has been 
attributed to President Clinton: NATO does not need Hungary and 
the other east-central European countries. However, it is my 
conviction that this is only a temporary political view. Sooner 
or later Western Europe and the Atlantic countries must realize 
that without creating and guaranteeing the security of 
east-central Europe it is impossible to create general European 
security. [end recording] 
  Does the Foreign Ministry consider the announcement 
official? 
  [Begin recording] [Foreign Affairs Spokesman Janos Herman] 
No, it is clear from news agency reports that this is a 
newspaper's opinion. The United States has never said recently 
that admission of this region's countries to NATO is expected in 
the near future. It is obvious that this is a process and that 
within this process, the NATO summit on 10 January in Brussels 
is going to be a very important event. 
  We expect that the NATO summit will make it unequivocal: The 
North Atlantic Alliance is an open organization, so the 
countries that meet the requirements, in perspective, may become 
members of the organization. A new initiative, the Partnership 
for Peace program, has come about. We expect that the NATO 
summit will open up and make this program accessible. Hungary 
accepts the Partnership for Peace initiative and strives to fill 
it with real content. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] However, the Partnership for 
Peace means a lot less than the possible membership. 
  [Herman] Yes, it means less. We can clearly see that it does 
not quite meet the expectations prevailing in the region and 
also in Hungary. However, it is a step in the right direction, 
and an important step at that, and we have no reason for not 
hoping that other steps will follow in the future. [end

<F P=106> [Interview with unnamed expert close to the secret service </F>
by Attila Schmidt; place and date not given: "Who Is a Spy And 
Who Is Not -- Even the CIA Was Unable To Look Into the Files of 
Our Agents"] 
  [Text] Spying is one of the most ancient occupations. It 
was originally called reconnaissance, and this name is still 
used because the military secret services like to call 
themselves reconnaissance units. The difference between 
intelligence [hirszerzes] and reconnaissance [felderites] in the 
classical sense is that reconnaissance is mainly the visual 
acquisition of information while intelligence is infiltrating 
enemy organizations through agents and technical means, said an 
expert who claims to be close to the secret service but who did 
not wish to name himself, when we interviewed him on this 
special activity. 
  [Schmidt] What is the correct term, intelligence or spying? 
  [Expert] This depends on the angle of the view. Throughout 
the world, every secret service calls its offensive body an 
intelligence service while the enemy's is a spy organization. 
When we are doing it, we are gathering information, and when 
the enemy does it, it is spying. 
  [Schmidt] Do all countries maintain an intelligence service? 
  [Expert] All states that consider themselves worth anything 
use intelligence agents, because it is a vital interest of all 
powers to learn about the political, economic, and military 
secrets of their enemies. However, the medium and small 
countries only maintain military reconnaissance or intelligence, 
but the activities of these also extend to civil areas. 
Naturally, the situation is different in the case of a 
superpower like the United States. Here, in addition to the 
CIA, all branches of the military practice active intelligence 
work. 
  [Schmidt] Does the Hungarian secret service operate in both 
directions? 
  [Expert] Yes, the two organizations are called the military 
and the civil information offices. 
  [Schmidt] Can it be expected that, after the new elections, 
the personnel of the secret service or the direction of 
reconnaissance will change? 
  [Expert] Fundamental changes will probably not take place 
after the change of the government, although it cannot be 
excluded that some of the leaders will be replaced, which is 
certainly not a sensible thing to do. Intelligence should be 
treated as a professional, rather than a political, organization. 
  [Schmidt] Was the intelligence service also "decimated" 
after the change of the regime? 
  [Expert] Some experienced intelligence agents were removed 
from their positions, but the clear-out was not as big as at the 
National Security Office. 
  [Schmidt] Have the directions of intelligence work changed? 
  [Expert] Essentially, they have. The former enemy turned 
into a friend and the former friend has turned into a suspicious 
country that is to be observed. Therefore, everything has to be 
done the same way as before, only in different directions. 
  [Schmidt] Do the friends spy on each other? 
  [Expert] Friendship and the hunger for information are two 
different things. Although we and many other countries have 
rather good relations with the United States, the CIA, as a 
global intelligence service, is active in all parts of the 
world, including Hungary. 
  [Schmidt] Are all military attaches intelligence agents at 
the same time? 
  [Expert] At any rate, it is the task of all military 
attaches to learn as much as possible about the army and the 
military secrets of the receiving country. For this reason, out 
of politeness, the receiving countries invite them to military 
exercises where they can learn about the armament, equipment, 
and certain secrets of the army. This is done on a reciprocal 
basis. The goal of this can be disinformation. 
  [Schmidt] What does "dark" information gathering mean? 
  [Expert] When for example an intelligence agent "disguised" 
as a diplomat gets to know some important person in the 
receiving country and acquires information from him in the 
course of a conversation, without the person knowing that he is 
giving information to a spy. 
  [Schmidt] Does the intelligence service recruit its agents 
through pressure? 
  [Expert] Yes and no. It is best if, for some reason, the 
chosen candidate voluntarily accepts to cooperate. 
  [Schmidt] How much money is normally given to an agent? 
  [Expert] This depends on the agent. It mainly depends on 
the financial and work position of the person. If someone earns 
$100,000 then he cannot be given $5,000. The amount has to be 
proportionate to the value of the information and the level of 
risk. 
  [Schmidt] After the change of the regime, did the CIA 
receive the list of our agents working abroad? 
  [Expert] Naturally, it did not. A single ill-considered 
step like this could mean the end of the intelligence service. 
The United States understood this and only asked for the 
material that we had given to the KGB. We did not fulfill this 
request, either, because they could have derived the names of 
the agents on the basis of this. 
  [Schmidt] Did the KGB conduct intelligence work against us? 
  [Expert] I am certain that it did not, because we did not 
have any secrets from them, all data was officially open to 
them. To prove that they did not have any agents here, when the 
Soviet troop withdrawals began from Hungary, we received many 
indications that they were hastily trying to meet this need. 
They were trying to enlist people. Probably without much 
success. 
  [Schmidt] Have you ever been approached? 
  [Expert] I have, a number of times. It was an interesting 
case when I was trying to enlist a South American diplomat and, 
during the conversation, it became clear that he had also met me 
in the very elegant restaurant with the intent of enlisting 
me....

  [Text] The security of the Visegrad Four meeting with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton will be provided by 3,000 policemen in 
Prague. According to Interior Ministry Spokesman Jan Subrt, 
these will be the most extensive security arrangements on the 
territory of the Czech Republic since 17 November 1989. 
According to Jan Subrt, over 200 U.S. citizens will take part 
in the security of Bill Clinton in Prague. The Czech police, 
however, will assume overall responsibility for the security of 
all five presidents. Jan Subrt said that the rapid deployment, 
antiterrorist, and other crack units of the special police 
forces will take part in the security arrangements. Police 
helicopters will participate in the action and the river police 
unit with divers will be on the alert in connection with the 
proposed walkabout by Bill Clinton on Charles Bridge. 
  [Prague Radiozurnal Radio Network in Czech at 1700 GMT on 4 
January adds that "the police have asked Prague citizens to show 
understanding for certain indispensable restrictions in 
connection with the extensive security arrangements accompanying 
U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit in Prague. The police 
recommend that citizens living in houses along the transit 
routes not open any windows when the presidential cavalcade 
passes by. The police will inform citizens of specific houses 
in good time. 
  ["Interior Ministry Press Spokesman Jan Subrt emphasized 
that 
the security situation in the Czech Republic is regarded by the 
U.S. side as stable and it is thought that the Prague meeting 
will pass without incident."]

<F P=106> ["(lek)"-signed report: "Semtex Is Being Secretly </F>
Duplicated Abroad, Claims Synthesia"] 
  [Text] Pardubice -- A plastic explosive labelled Semtex, 
which is turning up all over the world, may not be the genuine 
product of the Synthesia Pardubice Company, but could -- 
according to Synthesia Spokesman Gregor Vavrina -- originate 
from some clandestine foreign producers. 
  According to the spokesman, Synthesia has information that 
such an explosive -- based on a formula similar to Semtex -- has 
plainly been manufactured abroad for several years. So far, 
however, the Pardubice company has been unable to obtain a 
sample of the so-called Semtex, which is apparently very similar 
to the original and has similar characteristics. Synthesia was 
the first company in the world to make its plastic explosives 
easy to detect in accordance with the 1991 international 
convention adopted within the framework of the struggle against 
terrorism. The export of Semtex was halted in 1989. Last year, 
Synthesia exported several dozen tonnes to Kuwait, where it was 
used to clear mine fields and destroy unexploded shells. 
  This November, Synthesia offered those countries to which it 
used to export Semtex the possibility of making the explosive 
detectable or, as the case many be, of destroying it free of 
charge if it was unsuitable for reprocessing. So far, according 
to the spokesman, no one has responded to this offer.

  [Text] Regarding the letter of U.S. President Bill Clinton 
referring to the arrival of his special envoy Madeleine 
Albright, President Milan Kucan concluded that the initiative of 
President Clinton is highly important and welcome in Slovenia. 
Ambassador Albright will brief the Slovene leadership with the 
conclusions of the NATO summit that will take place on 10 and 11 
January. This will primarily involve NATO's security 
cooperation with Central and East European countries and the 
so-called partnership for peace. In Kucan's opinion this issue 
is very important for Slovenia, which is a small country with 
rather limited possibilities for investment into armament. 
However, other issues that will supposedly be discussed are 
also interesting for Slovenia, for example, the issues 
concerning the functioning of the United Nations, part of which 
are humanitarian aid, implementation of measures, work of the 
war crimes tribunal, and expansion of the UN Security Council. 
  Milan Kucan also believes that the talks with Madeleine 
Albright in Slovenia will also be an opportunity to discuss 
relations between the states, as Ms. Albright is a good 
connoisseur of the situation in Slovenia and in the region.

<F P=106> [Report by Pawel Jablonski: "Inflation Still Dangerous"] </F>
  [Text] The National Bank of Poland [NBP] has prepared 
another "Report on the Condition of Money"; this time the report 
is devoted to the situation in 1993. The authors of this report 
attempted to evaluate the way money is fulfilling its 
fundamental function: the function of a measure of value. A 
lot of attention was given to inflation as a process that 
restricts purchasing power. In 1993, it was possible to limit 
inflation quite considerably; however, it is still high and the 
sources that cause it have not disappeared. 
  The main factor that increases inflation, on the side of 
demand, is the persistently large budget deficit. As a result 
of the need to service this debt, instead of extending credits 
to companies, banks are loaning money to the budget, which 
offers high interest rates. This, in turn, has brought on 
higher interest rates for credits to companies. 
  The growth of wage levels also contributed to the fact that 
demand inflation lingered on. In the costs of obtaining 
incomes, the share of wages increased from 11.3 percent in 1991 
to 11.5 percent in 1992, and to 12 percent in the first six 
months of 1993. 
  The factors that are the main sources of cost-induced 
inflation are increases in prices regulated by the government -- 
prices that are raised until they reach world levels, or until 
they reach the level corresponding to the costs of production or 
maintenance (apartment rents). It is estimated that the 
23-percent price increase in the first three quarters of 1993 
was caused, in at least 67 percent of the cases, by 
cost-and-price impulses brought on by government's decisions. 
In addition, the creeping devaluation of the zloty is a 
constant cost impulse. Costs also increased as a result of the 
fixed devaluation of the zloty in August. Moreover, higher 
inflation was the result of the raising of the turnover tax and 
the introduction of the VAT. 
  NBP believes that despite stabilization measures, there is a 
danger that inflation may increase. This becomes particularly 
clear if we collate the indicators of the growth of prices for 
consumption goods and services after the first three quarters of 
1993 (23 percent) and the indicators of the prices for 
industrial production (26.4 percent). Therefore, there may be a 
pressure that retail prices be raised, which in turn, if 
financial policy is slack, may bring about higher inflation. 
  At this point, the NBP elaboration needs to be supplemented. 
Last November, inflation increased by 4 percent; in December the 
indicator will certainly be even higher. 
  Combating inflation only through a sharper financial policy, 
without coordinating it with fiscal and budget policies, may 
yield no results. In line with NBP evaluations, in the present 
conflict between fiscal and financial policies, the goals of the 
former seem to dominate, which is favorable in terms of 
stimulating inflation. 
<H5>  Fluidity </H5>
  In the first ten months of last year, the money supply 
increased by 22.6 percent. This means that in real terms, in 
1993 the supply of money decreased. It achieved the lowest 
level in May and June, which was related to the low increase of 
cash money. This year, the share of cash money as a percentage 
of the overall money supply gradually decreased. In December 
1992 it constituted 21 percent; last August -- 18.9 percent. 
However, this is not a result of a relative decrease in the 
importance of cash money in the economy, but a result of an 
increase of the role of other components of the money supply, 
primarily foreign currency deposits. Their share in the money 
supply increased from December 1992 to October 1993 by 3.81 
percent -- to 28.56 percent. This was only partially caused by 
the fixed devaluation. 
  To regulate the money supply, the central bank employed 
several instruments: obligatory reserve rates, open market 
operations, and interest rates. The short-term fluidity of the 
banking sector was steered by means of open market operations. 
However, it was first of all Treasury bonds that helped absorb 
the fluidity. By determining interest rates, NBP defined its 
expectations concerning inflation and exerted influence on the 
interest rates offered by deposit-and-credit banks. Actually, a 
policy of positive interest rates was implemented all year, 
which was supposed to encourage people to save their money, 
especially in zloty accounts. There is a close relationship 
between the rates of the Central Bank and commercial banks as 
far as interest rates on deposits are concerned. The interests 
on one-year deposits were actually set at the level of 
refinanced credits. However, the interest rates on credits, 
even though the Central Bank rates have not changed since 
February, dropped from 41 percent in March to 39 percent in 
November of last year. The interest rate of pawn credits is the 
price of the credit which NBP can extend for a short period of 
time to banks in lien on securities. 
  In the first months of last year, the rate of this credit 
started to deviate clearly from the interest rate on inter-bank 
deposits, which is the market price of money. Nevertheless, 
from July the levels of these rates started to draw closer to 
one another, which, according to NBP, proves that the inter-bank 
market is functioning better. 
<H5>  Between the Zloty and the Dollar </H5>
  Last year the structure of saving changed in households. 
Apart from the growth of foreign currency deposits from 41.8 
percent in December 1992 to 48.1 percent in October last year, 
we saw a decrease in the share of fixed-time deposits in the 
overall value of savings kept in banks, from 80.3 percent in 
December 1992 to 75.3 percent last October. In the first six 
months of last year this share was at one level -- 81.6-81.2 
percent. It started to drop in July and became more rapid in 
September. 
  According to NBP, last year the form of saving money 
changed. 
In 1992 the increase of zloty savings of households was, in 
real terms, twice as big as the increase of foreign currency 
changes; in the nine months there was quite a different trend -- 
this year the real increase in savings was first of all the 
result of an increase in foreign currency deposits. 
<H5>  Stock Exchange As a Competitor for Banks </H5>
  The last year is associated with the stock exchange. The 
exchange rates of stocks, measured with the Warsaw Stock 
Exchange Index, increased 1,200 percent. Some of the funds 
invested in the stock exchange come from bank deposits, as a 
result of which the increase in depositing money in the banks 
was curbed. Another source of the funds were bank credits, 
including consumption credits. However, analyses show that the 
role of bank credits is not significant. 
  In the past few years, we have noted increasingly more cases 
of Polish banknotes being forged. In 1991 the number of 
revealed forgeries was twice as large as in 1990. In 1992, it 
was eight times as big. Also in the first eight months of last 
year, we noted eight times as many cases as in all of 1992. One 
of the reasons for such an increase in the number of forgeries 
is the fact that the zloty became the money desired by 
foreigners, especially those from the former Soviet Union.

<F P=106> [Report by Weronika Kostyrko: "The End of RFE?"] </F>
  [Text] All the employees in Radio Free Europe's [RFE] 
Polish section received layoff notices toward the end of 
December. The section is to be moved from Munich to Warsaw in 
the spring. "We have nothing to go back to," say the radio 
employees, to whom the closure of the Munich station is a 
"betrayal by the Americans" and a "shock." The U.S. Government 
intends to close down RFE's Munich facility, which has existed 
since 1952. The Afghan section's electricity supply has already 
been cut off, and the Hungarian section was closed down on 1 
November. 
  The Polish and Czech sections will move to their respective 
countries, but will continue to be maintained by the U.S. 
Congress until September 1995. Then they will be privatized. 
Radio Liberty, serving the former USSR republics, plus the RFE 
Slovak, Bulgarian, Romanian, Serbian, and Croatian sections, 
will be moved to Washington or Prague. 
  "The people here lived like in a ghetto," the Polish 
employees told me. "They spent most of their time inside the 
station itself, and lived in communal apartment blocks. Many of 
them never learned German. We have nothing to go back to in 
Poland." 
  "We hoped that the putsch in Moscow would save us," one of 
the employees added. 
  Half of RFE's 1,500 employees will lose their jobs as a 
result of the reorganization. The Poles, almost 100 of them, 
will be paid until June. But the Warsaw Bureau will only have 
15 posts. RFE's Warsaw Bureau, operational since 1990, already 
prepares 80 percent of the material on Poland. The Warsaw staff 
are younger, and are not burdened by any emigre past. Their 
work style is also different -- they report from the streets and 
interview left-wing politicians, something which RFE veterans 
frown upon. 
  "The competition for jobs in Warsaw is open to everyone, but 
will someone who spent years broadcasting from behind a desk 
ever go into the Sejm with a microphone?" wonders a young 
reporter from RFE's Warsaw bureau. 
  "RFE's mission was a kind of slow suicide," Jan 
Nowak-Jezioranski [distinguished author] wrote one year ago. 
"Its mission was to regain the freedom of the media in Poland, 
in other words bring about a situation where Western radio 
ceased to be necessary." According to the latest surveys, only 2 
percent of the Polish population listens to RFE.

<F P=106> [Interview with Victor Ciorbea, president of the National </F>
Confederation of Romania's Free Trade Unions-Fratia, by Liana B. 
Iacob; place and date not given: "The Unions Cannot Accept a 
Government of the Left Extreme That Is Being Prepared Now!"] 
  [Text] [Iacob] As a result of the PUNR [National Romanian 
Unity Party] initiative, according to the statement made by 
[PUNR Chairman Gheorghe] Funar, the trade unions should expect 
to be invited to participate directly in the establishment of a 
political and social pact. What is your opinion regarding this 
issue? 
  [Ciorbea] For the time being, we are expecting a special 
invitation addressed to us, after which, together with Alfa 
[trade union confederation] and the BNS [National Trade Union 
Bloc], we will establish whether we will attend those 
discussions jointly or rather separately. In case we are really 
invited, we will adopt the same stance as before, because in our 
assessment the situation has remained unchanged. The trade 
unions will not give up the idea of a real coalition government 
set up with the participation of the parties that are members of 
the democratic opposition. Otherwise we see no way in which a 
social pact could be achieved and we are not prepared to 
conclude such a pact with the current government. 
Unfortunately, for the time being, all that may be expected is 
merely a government reshuffle. However, the trade unions cannot 
accept a government of the extreme left that is being prepared 
now! Under such circumstances, I do not believe that another 
round of talks could be held with the unions. 
  [Iacob] Do you intend to go on with your plan for the month 
of January, referring to the continuation of the union struggle 
by means of strikes, even if Cotroceni [the presidency] invites 
you to sign a social pact? 
  [Ciorbea] Yes, our plan remains valid, and I would like to 
emphasize the fact that union solidarity is stronger than ever, 
despite all contrary rumors and despite the alleged diminishing 
of the tension at the basis of the unions. A reshuffled 
government, with a significant shift to the left and 
authoritarian tendencies makes the entire reform process and 
even democracy quite questionable, and therefore we cannot 
accept a compromise with such grave consequences. We continue 
to consult with the parties belonging to the democratic 
opposition and we reassert the need for their authentic 
participation in the governing of the country, and not merely by 
the participation of a number of their representatives who would 
receive decorative offices. 
  [Iacob] Should a coalition government be set up, are the 
leaders of the large trade union confederations prepared to 
personally participate in the government? 
  [Ciorbea] Under such circumstances it is possible that some 
of the union leaders would accept to participate in the 
government if they are asked to, and considering their 
experience achieved in the union movement, they might prove to 
be more efficient on the other side of the barricade as well. 
Personally, I haven't considered my joining the government, as 
I believe that there is still a great deal of work for me to do 
here, in the union movement.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Ion Cristoiu: "Romania's Status in the World </F>
at the End of 1993"] 
  [Text] Those who follow the international press and 
television were able to note that, of late, a true campaign has 
begun to present Romania as the country with the greatest number 
of difficult problems in Eastern Europe. Ever since the 
beginning of December, the big dailies and news agencies in the 
intensively developed countries placed particular emphasis on 
the antigovernment and antipresidential demonstrations organized 
in Bucharest and throughout the country by the trade unions and 
students organizations. All press items and television 
broadcasts mentioned the fact that these were the most 
widespread people's demonstrations in the wake of December 1989. 
Western investors, who form their opinion about a country from 
newspapers and television programs, probably had the impression 
of a social-politically instable Romania that is shaken by 
social unrest. Thus it is clear that no investor will be 
tempted to invest his money in a country that is more unstable 
than quicksand. The anniversary of the Romanian revolution was 
an opportunity for the international press and television to 
review the road covered by Romania so far. Catastrophic, to say 
the least, was the conclusion drawn by all press reportages and 
television programs devoted to this inventory. From the United 
States to Japan, readers were reminded that Romania is the only 
country in the East where the communists are still in power and 
that Romania is a country led by extreme nationalists, even 
fascists. Now, at the end of the year, Western reporters deemed 
it fit to deal again with Romania. The image one gets from 
Western television reportage is that of a backward country that 
has been unable to break away not only from communism, but not 
even from Ceausism [Ceausescu-type of system]. The European 
television channel Euro-News last week broadcast two singularly 
violent reportages devoted to Romania. First, they dwelled on 
the absolute poverty prevailing in the country. Second, on the 
nostalgia regarding Nicolae Ceausescu. Other reputed television 
channels also carried programs devoted to Romania. CNN, for 
instance, carried a brief reportage on HIV-positive children in 
Romania, who are spending their last days in the misery of local 
hospitals. The French TV5 Channel dealt with the street 
children. The images broadcast by CNN, Euro-News, and TV5 to 
the world are strikingly reminiscent of the images broadcast by 
international television channels immediately after the December 
1989 revolution. It goes without saying that now, at the end of 
1993, Romania's image in the world, an image created by the 
international press and television, is as poor as that of 1990. 
  The violent campaign against Romania may be surprising up to 
a point. Within the inventory made regarding 1993, the 
presidency and government boasted about great international 
achievements: the granting of most-favored-nation status, the 
accord with the IMF, and the admission to the Council of Europe. 
More surprising than ever before, President Ion Iliescu assured 
us that Romania's isolation has come to an end. The position of 
the international press and television is also shocking because 
of the way they report on actual reality. No matter how 
critically we viewed Iliescu's regime, a regime that has been in 
power in Romania since December 1989, we cannot say that nothing 
has changed on the sociopolitical or economic levels. At least 
from a legal point of view, the foundation was laid for a 
pluralist system, there is freedom of expression, and the market 
economy has begun to take shape. It is clear that the 
television programs and press articles devoted to Romania do not 
bear this in mind. Portraying Romania in black colors is also 
slightly strange from another point of view. For more than a 
year now, the government and presidency have been talking about 
the tremendous political and financial efforts to improve our 
country's image in the world. Tremendous sums of U.S. dollars 
have been spent on publicity in reputable dailies and weeklies. 
Each Romanian in the Diaspora is being courted infinitely. The 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs says that all our embassies have 
made it their aim to present the true situation in our country. 
  The surprising nature of Romania's disastrous image in the 
world is only apparent. In actual fact, the poor portrayal of 
our country in the Western press and television is perfectly 
explicable. It represent the effect of a situation that was 
specific to Romania after the December 1989 revolution. The 
period that followed the Romanian revolution was a period of 
disappointment throughout the world. I am not talking of the 
fact that the former party activist, Ion Iliescu, is at the helm 
of the country. In other countries, which belonged to the 
communist camp, power was also taken over by former communists. 
They, however, manifested themselves from the very beginning as 
firm advocates of political pluralism, democracy, and market 
economy. Admitting publicly that they had been communists, they 
proved that the long experience of dictatorship convinced them 
of the failure of implementing the Marxist-Leninist doctrine. 
Ion Iliescu and his cronies did not do the same. For a long 
time, the current president acted as a tardy perestroykist. In 
his statements in 1990 he pleaded for communism with a human 
face. This public support for communism was coupled by a number 
of political actions, which were clearly at variance with 
democratic principles. I am talking of the famous miners' 
incursions, which attempted to eliminate the opposition and the 
independent press by means of armed civilians. By and by, the 
international press formed the image of a Ion Iliescu full of 
communist nostalgia. 
  Public opinion throughout the world was convinced of this 
on the basis of the articles and televised reportage devoted to 
the violation of the principles of democracy in Romania after 
December 1989. Unfortunately for Ion Iliescu, the history of 
Russia and of the Eastern countries took a different course than 
the one desired by him. In Russia, the former activist Boris 
Yeltsin proceeded to radical democratic reforms and the market 
economy. All the countries, which used to belong to communism, 
firmly embarked on the road to a market economy. Had Gorbachev 
not fallen, had Russia not embarked on the road to democracy, 
and had the communist regimes in China and Cuba not declared the 
bankruptcy of the centralized economy, Ion Iliescu would 
probably have advocated the cause of communism with a human 
face. Left all by himself in Eastern Europe, slowly, slowly the 
president worked toward a substantial change in his political 
platform. Under domestic and international pressure, he 
declared to be the advocate of democratic reform. Firmly 
influenced also by the former FSN [National Salvation Front] 
reformist grouping, he had to accept, albeit reluctantly, the 
radical measures in the direction of proceeding to a market 
economy. Consequently, pluralism and a free market began to take 
shape in Romania. The press, however, works with general 
images, in general terms. It has to constantly bear in mind the 
already existing opinion of its readers. Thus, when it came to 
Ion Iliescu and realities in Romania, the international press 
and television were subject to this very law. The president's 
and our country's image is that formed in the wake of the 1989 
revolution. That is the image of a neocommunist president who 
is leading a country immobilized by its obsolete structures. To 
alter this image is a very difficult thing. For this to happen, 
the international press would have to assume numerous risks, 
including that of contradicting its readers. Consequently, 
foreign reporters come to Romania with an image they formed in 
1990. Here, however, they find a much more pronounced reality. 
It is difficult and practically impossible for them to reflect 
these nuances in their reporting. This is why they seek 
elements in Romania's reality today that will confirm their 
preconceived image. Hence the contradiction between the 
reportages devoted to Romania of late and the reality of our 
sociopolitical situation, including the president's conduct. It 
is useless to talk about how harmful this perception of our 
country in the world is. As I have said before, the former 
communist countries are involved in a fierce competition in 
order to attract foreign capital and to occupy a place in the 
forefront in the world today. This period following the 
collapse of communism is decisive for the place of a former 
communist country in the world hierarchy. The big European and 
worldwide games are taking place now. This is tellingly proven 
by the question regarding the East European countries' entry 
into NATO. All East and Central European countries want 
guarantees on the part of the most powerful military treaty in 
the present-day world regarding possible expansionist attempts 
by Moscow. Obtaining such guarantees is, for each country that 
used to belong to the communist camp, a matter of national 
interest. The position of the West toward this desire of the 
East European countries is being established, however, on the 
basis of the image each of these states, which were formerly 
under Soviet occupation, enjoy in the world. Thus it is clear 
that Romania's image in the international press plays a decisive 
role in the place and role attributed to our country by the 
great powers in the Balkan area and in Europe. Naturally, there 
are numerous situations in which the great powers specifically 
bear in mind their geopolitical interests. No government of any 
Western country can take the liberty, however, of ignoring 
public opinion. No matter how important Romania would be from a 
geopolitical point of view, the leaders of the major powers also 
have to bear in mind what the public thinks about Romania. And 
the beliefs of the public are forged by the press and 
television. From this point of view, we may say that Romania's 
image in the international press and television profoundly harms 
our national interests. The West's reticence toward our entry 
into NATO is a sign of this harmful reality. 
  However, how can Romania's image in the world be changed? 
That is very easy. Through a radical change in the political 
regime, a change that through its spectacular nature would 
decisively influence Western public opinion. This change could 
be achieved, among other things, in two directions. One would 
be President Ion Iliescu's firm public commitment to reform and 
democracy. As long as the president continues, however, to 
flounder, to promote an ambiguous policy that is neither 
rightist, nor leftist, this direction will be practically 
impossible. Another solution would be to form a coalition 
government with the participation of the opposition. Given its 
exceptional nature, this event would capture the attention of 
the media throughout the world. For the international press and 
television this would be a real opportunity to persuade the 
public that something has happened in Romania. Is Cotroceni 
[presidency seat] aware of this requirement? Judging by the 
bluff represented by the initiative of consulting the 
parliamentary parties, it seems that the answer is no.
