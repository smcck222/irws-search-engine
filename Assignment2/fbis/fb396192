<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Prevlaka to the Muslims?"] </F>
  [Text] Having had great difficulties with raising a 
quorum, five committees of the Chamber of Representatives held 
sessions on Tuesday [28 December] to discuss the bills prepared 
for the emergency session announced for the afternoon. The 
Committee for Selection and Appointment supported the bill 
relieving Stjepan Herceg of the duties of state attorney and 
proposed appointing Krunislav Olujic to this position. They 
also supported relieving Dragoslav Gecl of his position as 
deputy governor of the National Bank of Croatia, which was 
requested by Gecl himself. 
  The Committee for Foreign Policy heard the report of Foreign 
Minister Mate Granic, who pointed out that the international 
community supports the integrity of Croatia, while the 
radicalism supported by some in Croatia is of no help. Granic 
claimed that the international community is not homogenous, as 
well as the European Union, but there are various interests at 
stake in their activities, in which the events following the 
elections in Russia play an important role. The main aims of 
Croatian foreign policy are to consolidate the position of 
Croatia, protect the Croatian national interests, and find 
common grounds with the international community, said Granic. 
  Speaking about the French-German proposal, Granic stated 
that 
it clearly followed from the proposal that the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot be solved politically without the 
solution for the UNPA's [United Nations Protected Areas] in 
Croatia. For the sanctions against Serbia to be suspended, the 
modus vivendi for Croatia should first be established, which 
implies a cease-fire, the opening of communications, and the 
reintegration of the Croatian areas under UN control. 
  Regarding the negotiations on Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
foreign 
minister stated that there was a consensus that the Muslims in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina should be given 33.3 percent of the 
territory, but that there were different opinions on where this 
territory should spread. Granic remarked that there were strong 
pressures on the Croats to concede territories, but it was 
accepted that the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina must have 17.5 
percent of the territory. Assessing the Muslim positions, 
Granic established that their orientation is to create a strong 
republic based on the assessment that they can conquer central 
Bosnia. The Croatian orientation is to stop this conflict 
through negotiations and to resolve it through political 
agreements. 
  Croatia is still offering the Muslims access to the sea, the 
use of the port of Celjevo on the Neretva River, the 
construction of the Stolac-Neum highway, and the tourist 
community of Klek, which would be under joint ownership, said 
Granic, adding that what the Muslims are demanding is not an 
access to the sea but rather an exit. Granic mentioned one of 
the possible variants: giving Prevlaka to the Muslims but 
getting the hinterland of Dubrovnik in return and keeping Neum 
under Croatian control, because, as Granic said, we will persist 
in demanding that there be no cutting of the Croatian territory 
at Neum. 
  The foreign minister remarked that strict observance of 
international humanitarian and war law will help in seeking a 
common ground with the European Union, reminding that the Croats 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina released 5,600 people from prisons, and in 
the last 32 days they provided passage for 284 humanitarian 
convoys. Granic said that this orientation will be persisted 
upon in the future, remarking that despite the Muslim offensive 
at the Croatian areas in central Bosnia, Croatia keeps insisting 
on negotiations. He announced that he was going to meet with 
[Bosnia-Herzegovina Foreign Minister] Haris Silajdzic sometime 
during the day. 
  The Committee for Legislation and the Committee for Work, 
Family, Youth, and Social Policy supported the bills regulating 
provisions for retirement and health funds and for children's 
allowance. The above-mentioned bills will become effective on 1 
January 1994, and the provision rates will remain at the same 
level as in 1993.

<F P=106> [Interview with Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic by </F>
Ante Gugo; place and date not given: "`Belgrade Decides -- War 
or Peace'"] 
  [Text] We can say that Mate Granic is a politician who 
marked the year coming to a close. Although he was appointed 
foreign minister as late as 1 June, it was that part of politics 
that marked global events. Unprecedented dynamism in meeting 
world diplomats and heads of states enabled Granic to make 
significant changes in the image of Croatia in the world, and 
thanks to his persistence and the right dose of determination, 
Resolutions 847 and 871 were adopted, unambiguously confirming 
Croatia's right to establish full sovereignty over its entire 
territory. His insistence on respecting international 
humanitarian law, regardless of the fact that the world did not 
view all sides from the same perspective regarding the issue of 
convoys, made the world understand that Croatia sincerely 
intends to establish peace. Although his efforts were disturbed 
by injudicious moves, primarily in Herceg-Bosna, Granic showed 
that, in a relatively short period of time, he acquired capital 
that can grant credit to the bad moves of others. Consequently, 
the destruction of the Old Bridge in Mostar did not have serious 
repercussions on Croatia. The fact that he was received by the 
United States Senate, and his ease in establishing contacts with 
his Western counterparts, speaks for his credibility as the 
representative of Croatian politics in the world. 
  [Gugo] At the end of this calendar year, could you summarize 
Croatian foreign politics? 
  [Granic] Croatian foreign politics are characterized by 
securing a better international position for our country. There 
were many problems, the pressure of the international community 
after the Maslenica operation to begin with, but especially due 
to the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We gave special 
consideration to solving the problem of the UNPA [United Nations 
Protected Area] zones. European integration processes and 
settling the relations with our neighbors were a parallel task. 
We obtained Resolutions 815, 820, 847, and 871, which 
undoubtedly confirm the right of the Republic of Croatia to 
sovereignty over its entire territory, i.e. within 
internationally recognized borders. Furthermore, President 
Tudjman launched a timely initiative. This period is probably 
also characterized by the failure of the Geneva talks, which 
contributed to reducing tensions toward us, for it finally 
became obvious who does not want peace. 
<H5>  "Help to Central Bosnia" </H5>
  [Gugo] The latest round of the Geneva talks had been 
announced quite optimistically, but there were no obvious 
improvements. Why? 
  [Granic] There were many bilateral talks on various levels, 
from peace mediators to foreign ministers. The Serbs were 
expected to show more leniency and Alija Izetbegovic was 
expected to show more determination to establish peace, which 
did not happen. Simultaneously, two important things happened -- 
on one hand, Karadzic was inflexible regarding the agreement on 
Sarajevo, thus triggering the rage of the international 
community, and, on the other hand, Izetbegovic did not turn out 
any better either. Refusing some rational solutions and 
demanding more concessions, Izetbegovic brought the negotiations 
to a dead end. What we have long been warning the international 
community about has obviously finally come to the surface -- 
that a great Muslim offensive is imminent. Izetbegovic wants to 
buy time and repeats demands to which we will never agree. 
  [Gugo] If the bilateral talks of the cochairmen of the 
Geneva conference were cause for optimism, what has changed in 
the meantime? 
  [Granic] At the first meeting, it was obvious that Milosevic 
gave an election speech for the public in Serbia. That was the 
main reason why no improvement was made. At the first plenary 
session, Izetbegovic accused the entire international community 
of being responsible for the suffering of his nation and for the 
disintegration of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Already at that point it 
was clear that no improvement was possible. At the second 
meeting, Milosevic was pressured by threats of even stricter 
sanctions, and he was much more prepared to talk. Karadzic was 
the one who did not accept some solutions. We must not have any 
illusions and view the two of them separately, for that was a 
trick. In fact, they belong to one and the same Serbian side. 
Alija Izetbegovic did not agree to some quite sensible and 
realistic solutions. A very strong ministerial delegation 
attempted to convince the Muslim side to accept sensible 
solutions, but it did not succeed. We were not surprised by 
that. We think that an agreement will soon be reached. On the 
other side, the Muslims think that they can still gain something 
by the military option and several factors are to their 
advantage. The most important one is the insufficient threat of 
the international community. 
  [Gugo] Can the Muslims achieve military victory in central 
Bosnia? 
  [Granic] Croatian enclaves are in a very bad position and 
helping them is one of our priority goals. The essence of our 
strategy is the survival of the Croats in central Bosnia and 
Sarajevo, and we need all the help we can get to realize that. 
We expect -- and the same holds for the entire European Union 
-- a Muslim state in which there will also be space for the 
Croats, just as there will be space for the Muslims in the 
Croatian republic. All of democratic Europe will support that 
type of secular state, but no one, in these parts, wants a 
fundamentalists county like that which some closest associates 
of Alija Izetbegovic want to create. 
<H5>  "We Will Not Give Neum" </H5>
  [Gugo] Our public was very disturbed by the alleged proposal 
of President Tudjman that the Muslims be given 5 km of the coast 
at Prevlaka. What is the background of such a move? 
  [Granic] We offered the approach to the sea to the Muslims, 
and that is something the international community asks from us. 
However, they exclusively demand access to the sea. The Croats 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina favored the creation of the union, i.e. 
they wanted a reciprocal protection of rights within units in 
the Union. It is well-known that the Serbs and the Muslims 
signed an agreement on the referendum for the exclusion from the 
Union. Such an act was accepted by the international community. 
The Croats must be prepared for both options, both for the 
disintegration and for the survival of the Union, but they will 
not do anything to prejudice any solution. At one point, the 
Muslims accepted the port on the Neretva River, a tourist 
complex under joint administration in the area of Klek, and the 
highway from Stolac to Neum. Afterwards, they expanded their 
demand to require sovereignty over Neum, to which we will never 
agree, for that would entail the dismembering of the Croatian 
ethnic territory. The cochairmen proposed an exchange of 
territory in the area of Prevlaka. President Tudjman left the 
possibility open, but only in case of establishing a lasting 
peace on the entire territory of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
As you see, there is no peace, and the Croats will not accept 
being cut off at Neum. 
  [Gugo] Does such an option not lead us into the trap of 
informally canceling resolutions that say that borders must not 
be changed? 
  [Granic] There was talk of exchanging territories among 
recognized and sovereign countries by agreement. 
  [Gugo] Can we expect to see the war end soon on occupied 
territories of the Republic of Croatia? 
  [Granic] At the meeting of the European Union, Serbia 
accepted the modus vivendi, which was publicly confirmed by 
Minister Jovanovic. That means that we must first establish a 
lasting cease-fire, and then open up communications. Then we 
must organize the "London II" conference, which will solve the 
questions of local autonomy. Only after that, at the "London 
III" conference, provided that a solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
is found, lifting sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro would be 
considered, as well as their inclusion into the international 
community. Actually, we must implement Resolutions 847 and 871. 
The Serbs are aware that the implementation of the peace plan 
is, in practice, also tied to lifting sanctions. At the latest 
session of the European Union, Russian Minister Churkin proposed 
that lifting sanctions be tied only to the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which encountered serious resistance. 
Indeed, he also proposed the immediate mutual recognition of 
Serbia and Croatia and the establishment of diplomatic 
relations. Lifting sanctions is, for us, totally unacceptable 
before the establishment of lasting peace. The fact is that 
Serbia is in the stage of preparing its own public to accept the 
peace plan for Croatia. 
  [Gugo] How long could that last? 
  [Granic] Any kind of Cyprus syndrome is out of the question, 
or the example of Germany, which waited for reunification for 50 
years. We demand a dynamic process. Anyway, you can estimate 
how long Milosevic can endure sanctions without serious social 
upheaval. 
<H5>  "Russia Is Not Against Croatia" </H5>
  [Gugo] Is one justified in fearing that the arrival of 
Greece at the head of the European Union will not contribute to 
a rapid solution to the war crisis? 
  [Granic] That does not have to be true at all. The Greek 
are not hiding their friendship with Serbia. We had many talks 
with them and I believe that they, too, will see to it that the 
war is over as soon as possible. 
  [Gugo] An extreme nationalist won the elections in Russia, 
and he announced breaking the sanctions imposed on Serbia. Are 
those threats founded and can they influence the present 
situation? 
  [Granic] They cannot lift sanctions imposed on Serbia. At 
the same time, a new constitution was introduced in Russia, 
giving authority to President Yeltsin. On the other hand, 
Zhirinovskiy is obviously not hiding his inclination toward 
Serbia and the fact that they want to lift sanctions as soon as 
possible. However, the view of official Russian politics does 
not violate the territorial integrity of the Republic of Croatia. 
  [Gugo] Do you really believe that, in any variant, those who 
pointed their weapons against Croatia, will allow two parts of 
Croatia to be joined through the territory that they presently 
control? 
  [Granic] UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces] is here 
to guarantee the success of that agreement. There are some 
people who are against reaching and implementing any agreement. 
Those are well-known facts. However, the position of Belgrade 
is here most important, for everything depends on that. The 
initiative of the European Union starts from the fact that 
Belgrade is directly responsible for the situation in the UNPA 
zones. 
  [Gugo] So, on one side, there is Milan Babic, who has had 
conflicts with Belgrade and was disobedient before, and on the 
other, UNPROFOR, which is totally incapable of doing anything 
using force.... 
  [Granic] With a clear stand of Belgrade regarding the UNPA 
zones, UNPROFOR itself will act differently. Unfortunately, 
even that does not guarantee the implementation of the peaceful 
option and we must therefore strengthen our defense forces in 
case the peace option is not possible. 
  [Gugo] That means that a military option is also being 
considered? 
  [Granic] More precisely, we will not allow any calculations 
or compromises with the Croatian territory. We will make no 
concessions regarding that. 
  [Gugo] Prime Minister Valentic's economic program cannot be 
realized without the integration of Croatia into European 
institutions. What is the situation regarding that? 
  [Granic] It is true that we are interested in being granted 
credit from the IMF, the World Bank, to enter the PHARE 
[Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] program.... 
Signing the peace agreement will allow Croatia access to all 
those institutions and we are capable of applying those programs 
very soon. We will demand to begin talks on our membership of 
European institutions, and we stand a good chance, for we 
respect all set conditions. After all, we have fully complied 
with everything we were asked to do regarding international 
humanitarian law. Let us just look at how many convoys are 
allowed free passage by the Croats, and what the Serb or the 
Muslims did with the convoy headed to Nova Bila. Indeed, there 
is an occasional act of sabotage, when we least need it. 
Looking at the time of the events in Ahmici, Stupni Dol, or the 
Old Bridge, it is obvious that those were sabotages against the 
position of Croatia. And we will have to deal with that. The 
Muslims committed many more terrible atrocities, but every 
stupid move of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats costs us much more. 
I do not intend to justify crimes done by some Croats, for they 
cannot be justified and I condemn them, but I want to point out 
that we went through many situations that were not to our 
advantage. The Old Bridge in Mostar was destroyed at the time 
when the image of Croatia in the world started to improve. The 
world knows of our efforts to release prisoners. In the past 32 
days, 284 convoys went through without any problem. The 
international community expects us to behave like that, and, 
whether some like it or not, we must respect international 
humanitarian law. Our politics must be transparent and credible. 
<H5>  "Changes at the Ministry" </H5>
  [Gugo] Does that mean that we can soon expect Croatia to 
become a member of European institutions? 
  [Granic] I believe that will mark the following year. 
European integration processes are our primary goal. Moreover, 
we would like to develop relations with major world powers and 
try to establish good relations with countries of outstanding 
economic development, like some Asian countries. We must also 
think of our neighbors and fully define our mutual relations. 
At the beginning of next year, there will be a ministerial 
meeting with Italy, and I hope that some minor tensions will 
disappear. We are especially interesting in developing good 
relations with Slovenia. There are some problems, like Krsko 
and Ljubljanska Banka, but expert groups are working and there 
will probably have no problems in solving these to mutual 
satisfaction. Regarding the Bay of Piran, I think that we have 
not yet exhausted all means, and that must be done before the 
arbitrage. Right after New Year, we will intensify our talks. 
  [Gugo] How much truth is there in rumors that we will soon 
see some significant changes in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs? 
  [Granic] I do not know what precisely you are referring to, 
but there will be some changes. According to the new law, our 
Ministry will be organized, as it is customary in Europe, and 
will have a state secretary, and some personnel changes have 
already been made. We established a permanent financial expert 
control in all embassies and consulates. From the month of 
March, permanent post-graduate studies will begin for the 
education of our personnel. We are working on improving the 
communication network, which is one of the more important 
factors in our Ministry. I believe that will contribute to 
organizing a modern and efficient state ministry.

  [Excerpts] Croat refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
majority of them from central Bosnia, organized a peaceful 
demonstration outside the Bosnia-Herzegovina Embassy in Zagreb 
today to protest at Muslim aggression against the Croatian 
population in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Reporter] You are a jihad embassy, the killers of Algeria 
are the same as those in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Vukovar equals 
Vitez -- these were some of the slogans which could be seen 
outside the embassy during a protest demonstration by about 100 
people. The police blocked their way about 30 meters from the 
embassy. [passage omitted] 
  Behind the tightly closed Bosnia-Herzegovina Embassy doors, 
the staff, well guarded by the police, show no signs of 
nervousness. Neven Kulenovic, an adviser in the embassy, 
commented that it is no coincidence that the demonstrations are 
taking place at a time when Jadranko Prlic is asking the 
Croatian Government to sever diplomatic relations with 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by C. M.: "Violation of the Will of the People"] </F>
  [Text] Knin -- "The SDS [the Serbian Democratic Party] of 
Krajina was the winner at the elections that have just ended," 
is stated at the beginning of a statement for the public, signed 
by Drago Kovacevic, chief of the party's electoral headquarters. 
This conclusion is supported by the fact that the SDS of 
Krajina won the greatest number of deputies in the future 
republican parliament and an absolute majority in 14 communes, 
while Dr. Milan Babic won at the presidential elections. 
"Through manipulation by the Republican Electoral Commission, 
Babic's victory has been quashed by enlarging the electoral body 
for 4 percent of invalid ballots, which is without precedent in 
the world." 
  "The Republican Electoral Commission, which consists of 
seven 
judges of the highest Krajina courts, in a so far unprecedented 
manner, usurped the right to alter laws, although this is an 
exclusive prerogative of the Assembly of the republic of Serbian 
Krajina, thus violating the legal system and the institutions." 
  Within the legally prescribed deadline, the SDS of Krajina 
has sent a request for protection of legality to the 
constitutional court of the republic of Serbian Krajina. "A 
decision to hold the second round of presidential elections on 
23 January 1994 and not on 9 January 1993, proceeding from the 
article 6A of the Law on Presidential Elections, constitutes the 
height of violation of legality by the Republican Electoral 
Commission. The SDS of Krajina, as a party that strictly 
observes democratic procedure has demanded protection of 
legality from the constitutional court of the republic of 
Serbian Krajina in a belief that the constitutional court will 
act in accordance with its authorities and put an end to the 
arbitrariness of the Republican Electoral Commission and the 
current authorities in the republic of Serbian Krajina.

Madeleine Albright has arrived in Zagreb. Tihomir Vinkovic 
reports for Croatian Radio: 
  [Vinkovic] Upon arrival at Zagreb aiport Ambassador Albright 
told journalists there were three reasons for her visit to 
Croatia: First is the stand of the American Administration that 
there is no justification of aggression, war crimes, and 
thwarting dispatch of humanitarian aid. The American 
Administration supports the sovereignty and the territorial 
integrity of the Republic of Croatia. Currently occupied 
Croatian territories have to be returned in a peaceful way and 
through a political solution, ambassador Albright said. The 
U.S. Government will support efforts for the restoration of 
peace and dispatch of humanitarian aid, particularly in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In the course of her visit to Croatia Ambassador Albright is 
to meet President Tudjman, Croatian Foreign Minister Mate 
Granic, representatives of the UN Protection Forces, UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees, and other humanitarian organizations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vojislav Seselj, chairman of the Serbian </F>
Radical Party, by BTA journalist Rayna Chobanova in Belgrade; 
date not given: "Everyone in Bosnia Should Get Their Own State"] 
  [Text] At the beginning of the eighties, the 38-year-old 
sociologist Vojislav Seselj was an admirer of the "patriarch of 
the Serbian national school" Dobrica Cosic. In 1984 Seselj was 
given an eight-year prison sentence by the post-Tito communist 
authorities when a document was seized from his home that 
praised the Titovization of Yugoslavia and condemned the federal 
system. Freed 22 months later, he founded the Serbian Radical 
Party, and a great number of dissidents flocked to support his 
ideas. 
  Later, however, the Serbian intellectuals distanced 
themselves from Seselj, frightened by the extreme radicalism of 
his views: a strong government, unification of the Serbian 
lands at any price, a hard stance toward the outside world, and 
liquidation of all "traitorous" parties in the country. 
Following the last elections his party now has 39 seats in the 
new Serbian parliament (previously it had 72). It is now the 
third largest party in parliament after the Socialist Party and 
the opposition Depos coalition [Democratic Movement of Serbia]. 
  [Chobanova] How do you view the situation in Serbia 
following the elections? 
  [Seselj] The socioeconomic situation in Serbia will remain 
very grave and will even worsen. How can it improve? This 
government has no program nor mechanisms to solve the economic 
and social problems. 
  [Chobanova] Can the Radical Party do anything to improve the 
situation? 
  [Seselj] We will continue to criticize the people in power 
in all fields. We will see what the results are. 
  [Chobanova] How did your break with the Socialists come 
about? 
  [Seselj] We have never been together. This is a great 
delusion that is widespread among the public. We simply gave 
them a chance to form a minority government. We were not in a 
coalition with them, and continually criticized them. Later, 
when we wanted to topple the government, they dissolved 
parliament. 
  We kept away only from Milosevic -- from the outset we did 
not criticize him, only the Socialists. Even now it would have 
been the same if Milosevic had not started arresting our 
supporters. We started criticizing him, and therefore won so 
few votes. Many people cannot stand the Socialist Party, but 
for some irrational reasons respect Milosevic. 
  [Chobanova] Let us talk about Bosnia. Will there be an end 
to the war? 
  [Seselj] I do not believe so, unfortunately. The Muslims 
are continually spurred on by the West and their appetites are 
growing. 
  [Chobanova] But surely they have no forces to oppose and 
resist? 
  [Seselj] They have obtained a lot of weapons. They 
delivered many weapons to them by air drops and they will try to 
mount a big offensive. 
  [Chobanova] Perhaps they are counting on foreign military 
intervention. What do you think about this? 
  [Seselj] They have lost on this point too, there will be no 
military intervention. Who wants to die for the Muslims in 
Bosnia. Furthermore, it is very difficult to intervene 
militarily in Bosnia. 
  [Chobanova] Did the Serbian Radical Party have any soldiers 
fighting in Bosnia? 
  [Seselj] Yes, but they were all part of the Serbian troops. 
We did not have any separate units. 
  [Chobanova] What do you think about the West's policy toward 
the Balkans as a whole, apart from Bosnia? 
  [Seselj] The West's policy is wrong. First, the Americans 
are settling some of their own accounts in the Balkans. It is 
in their interest to halt the unification of Europe. They want 
to hinder the consolidation of the EC. If there were no 
conflicts in the Balkans, they would dream one up, to justify 
their intervention and presence here. 
  Second, Germany wanted to draw Slovenia and Croatia within 
its orbit. This is the reason Yugoslavia split. Germany has 
not yet stopped completely at this point. The Americans also 
have their interests regarding Turkey, and protect it. 
  [Chobanova] They also have interests in connection with 
Macedonia. 
  [Seselj] Macedonia is also connected with this, because the 
Americans clearly realize that the EC will never accept Turkey 
as a member. For this reason, Turkey is a convenient ally for 
them to drive a wedge into the heart of Europe. Turkey also has 
appetites regarding Bulgaria and Greece and wants to establish a 
convenient link with Macedonia, Albania, Sandjak, and Bosnia. 
  [Chobanova] Today, when Macedonia is an independent state, 
it cannot remain an apple of discord and will not burden the 
relations between Serbia and Bulgaria. 
  [Seselj] It should not make these relations difficult, but I 
fear there will be a big war in Macedonia, because 40 percent of 
its population are Albanians. 
  [Chobanova] After Zhirinovskiy's victory in Russia you said 
that "our man has won in Moscow." Your words received great 
publicity in Bulgaria. Moreover, a few days ago Russia said 
that it wants to play a bigger role in the Balkans. 
  [Seselj] It is in our interest for Russia to play a bigger 
role in the Balkans. Russia has traditionally helped Serbia, 
Bulgaria, Greece, and Romania. Always, when we were close to 
Russia, when Russia intervened, we gained benefit from it. As 
soon as Austria-Hungary or Germany intervened, it immediately 
caused a quarrel between the Balkan peoples. 
  For example, look at the war between Serbia and Bulgaria in 
1885: It was completely unnecessary. This war was provoked by 
Austria-Hungary, and the Serbs suffered the most from it. 
  [Text] A short time ago Vuk Draskovic said that the 
division of Bosnia would not be to the Serbs' advantage, because 
it would create an Islamic state in the heart of Europe. The 
Islamic countries will aid the new state and Serbia will be left 
to its own fate. 
  [Seselj] Such a danger does exist, but when this civil war 
is over, we Serbs have no intention of living with the Muslims 
any longer. We did not start this war. The West persuaded 
Izetbegovic to insist on complete independence. 
  Much blood has been shed in this war. Why should we live 
together again? It is better to separate. Otherwise, we will 
continue to have bad relations with the Muslims. Why should we 
have a permanently unstable state? We want to have within our 
state the parts that are Serbian, that are indisputably Serbian. 
It never came into our minds to keep Macedonia by force. There 
is no Serbian majority there. Why should we force 700,000 
Bulgarians, 700,000 Albanians and God knows who else to live 
together with us? No conflicts have broken out there either, no 
attacks on (Yugoslav Army) barracks. Our army withdrew from 
there peacefully. Why should we do it? 
  In Kosovo, however, we cannot retreat. For us this is sacred 
ground and we cannot give it up. On the other hand, we do we 
need central Bosnia, where Muslims form the majority -- in 
Zenica, Tuzla, and so on? It is true that these have never been 
Serbian lands, and the Muslims have never been Serbs, although 
they possessed a Serbian national consciousness for several 
centuries. 
  [Chobanova] I also wanted to discuss the prospects for 
relations with Bulgaria. 
  [Seselj] We support having the best possible relations with 
Bulgaria. When we were all in the same party -- Draskovic, 
Komnenic, and me -- when those demonstrations took place in 
Skopje in the spring of 1990, we sent a letter in support of the 
Bulgarians. I have always been against recognizing this 
fictitious Macedonian nation, and have always advocated 
friendship with Bulgaria and finding a compromise solution. We 
hold the view that the eastern part of Macedonia should be 
handed over to Bulgaria. 
  [Chobanova] Do you suggest that Macedonia should be divided? 
  [Seselj] Yes, it should. The part populated by Bulgarians 
should belong to Bulgaria. I think this would be the best 
solution. And one of the reasons in its favor is the Albanian 
danger. Only by such a solution will we finally eliminate 
Turkey in the Balkans. If necessary, Albania should also be 
given the Western part of Macedonia, where Albanians form the 
majority. It is important to us for the Albanians not to become 
a majority in the Vardar valley, which is a vitally important 
artery for us. 
  There is a danger that this may come about. The Albanians 
already form a majority in Skopje.

  [Text] Belgrade, Jan 4 (AFP) -- Five coal miners who 
helped coordinate a strike last week in the Kolubara basin near 
here were detained Tuesday, as court authorities launched a 
probe into allegations of sabotage linked with the stoppage, 
reports said. The arrests were announced by Zdravko Vucetic, 
the miners' union leader in the region 80 kilometres (50 miles) 
south of the capital, who told journalists that plans to resume 
strike action Tuesday had been shelved. 
  "We have suspended the strike until January 15, but... none 
of our demands have been met," he said. Vucetic named the five 
detainees as Milan Rankovic and Jelenko Micic -- both members of 
the Serbian Electricians' Union -- and strike committee members 
Ivan Zdravkovic, Dragan Vesic and Milisav Mihajlovic. 
  Meanwhile the Belgrade prosecutor opened an inquiry into 
alleged sabotage in connection with the strike, and called on 
police to "identify the employees at the Kolubara coal mine 
whose work stoppage caused enormous difficulties in electricity 
distribution," the TANJUG agency reported. Under Serbian law, 
anyone found guilty under the inquiry could be liable for a 
minimum sentence of three years in prison. 
  Vucetic said he was "indignant" at the sabotage accusations, 
which he rejected. The miners suspended their action on Friday 
for the New Year break as the stoppage triggered sharp power 
cuts throughout Serbia. The strikers had demanded a monthly 
salary of 35.9 [German] marks (around 20 dollars) and goods to 
the value of 50 marks by December 31, plus 10 kilogrammes (22 
pounds) of meat at "affordable" prices by the end of January. 
  In a separate development here Tuesday the medical staff at 
a 
suburban hospital resumed a strike they suspended for the New 
Year's holiday, Belgrade radio said. The director at the 
hospital in Zemun said doctors and nurses were handling only 
minimal emergency services. They launched their action over a 
salary dispute Thursday, amid a spate of strikes that paralysed 
several sectors, including mines, railroads, and public 
transport and health services during the last two days of 
December. Two leaders of the railroad strike were detained by 
police over the weekend. Although authorities have granted 
several recent demands for higher wages, any increases have been 
quickly cancelled out by the effects of the hyper-inflation 
hitting Serbia.

  [Text] The Republic of Kosova Information Center reports 
that the Supreme Court of Serbia continues to detain 10 Kosovar 
Albanians who were arrested by the Serbian police last November 
on the charge that, allegedly, they and some other persons, as 
members of the Kosova Defense Ministry, made preparations for an 
armed war in Kosova. The counsels of the defendants have 
declared that the arrest of the Albanian youngsters runs counter 
to Serbian laws and this presents another flagrant violation of 
investigation procedures. The counsels of these Albanian 
prisoners have also declared that the defendants are 
continuously tortured by the Serbian police.

<F P=106> [By Victoria Stegic] </F>
  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, Jan 4 (AFP) -- At least five people 
were killed and 27 others were wounded in Sarajevo Tuesday [4 
January] as Bosnian Serbs pounded the Bosnian capital with heavy 
artillery fire, hospital officials told AFP. At midday wounded 
were still arriving at Sarajevo hospitals as the bombing 
continued. 
  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 
spokesman Ray Wilkinson said the number of humanitarian airdrops 
over Bosnia would be increased over the next few days for 
psychological reasons, with about 17 planes, mainly American, 
taking part in the operation instead of eight. Regions which 
had so far failed to receive any relief goods would be targeted 
first, he added. [passage omitted] 
  Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic was due to meet with 
Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic in Vienna Tuesday ahead 
of upcoming peace negotiations in Geneva on the Bosnian conflict. 
  The latest deaths in Sarajevo come after 15 people died and 
22 people were wounded during heavy shelling Monday in one of 
the worst violence in weeks, according to UN Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) spokesman Idesbald van Biesebroeck. 
  On Tuesday at least six shells rained down on a building 
between Marsal Tito Avenue, the main street of Sarajevo's old 
town, and the Skenderija neighborhood where a large UNPROFOR 
contingent from France has been deployed. The shells fell a few 
hundred meters (yards) from Skenderija and the Bosnian 
president's offices. Shelling was also reported from other 
parts of the city. 
  Van Biesebroeck said UN military observers estimate the 
Serbs 
lobbed 203 shells on the capital Monday while predominantly 
Moslem government troops fired 37. Serb forces have besieged 
Sarajevo since April 1992. Van Biesebroek said artillery fire 
was also reported from Gornji Vakuf and Busovaca, central Bosnia 
Monday. 
  Bosnian Croat forces fired 20 mortars on east Mostar, the 
Moslem-dominated main city of southern Herzegovina, but no toll 
was immediately available. In eastern Bosnia, the situation was 
calm Monday but Bosnian Serbs prevented a humanitarian aid 
convoy from reaching the Moslem enclave of Gorazde, the 
spokesman said. [passage omitted] 
  Greek European Affairs Minister Theodore Pangalos meanwhile 
said it would be "absurd" to bomb targets in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
as this would only "worsen the massacre in a bid to end the 
atrocities." Greece, which took over the six-month rotating 
presidency of the European Community on January 1, was 
"absolutely opposed" to air strikes. "Not one but all 
(belligerants) would have to be bombed, which would be a rather 
absurd peace plan," Pangalos told Radio France International.

  [Text] The fifth day of the new year is marked by less 
intensive but continual aggression by both Bosnia-Herzegovina's 
neighbors. Big towns like Sarajevo, Zenica, Tuzla, and Mostar 
have been the target of the aggressors' artillery. Tuzla and 
the area in and around Zivinice are sporadically being attacked 
by tanks and mortars from Mount Majevica. The general danger 
alarm is in force almost continuously. The situation is similar 
in Zenica. The (?Ustasha) aggressor in central Bosnia is trying 
to reach Novi Travnik but in vain. It is firing on (?Velike) 
[names indistinct] with howitzers, Bofors guns, and heavy [word 
indistinct]. 
  Gornji Vakuf is being attacked with 82-mm and 120-mm 
mortars. 
The aggressor is regrouping around Zavidovici and carrying out 
provocations. Provocations are also taking place in the Seven 
South zone, where [word indistinct] and 120-mm mortars are being 
used to pound civilian targets in Sije and Mravici. In the 
Maglaj zone, [words indistinct] multiple rocket launchers. The 
Olovo-Kladanj front is unusually quiet, but the aggressor is 
regrouping its forces and occasionally carrying out artillery 
attacks. 
  The free zones of Brcko and Gradacac are also experiencing 
regular artillery provocations. In the zone of the 6th Corps, 
the chetniks are targeting Glavaticevo with a tank and mortars. 
The (?Ponikve) area is being attacked with anti-aircraft 
weapons. 
  The Ustashas are using 120-mm and 82-mm mortars in 
Jablanica, 
and anti-aircraft machine guns and 120-mm mortars in the 
Neretvica valley and the free [name indistinct]. Gorazde was 
targeted by chetnik artillery from [name indistinct]. The enemy 
artillery (?attacked) the Sarajevo defense lines overnight and 
this morning. [words indistinct] fired from Dvor landed on 
Zabrdje. Sokolje, [names indistinct] were also shelled. As many 
as 45 mortar bombs that were fired from Dvor landed on [words 
indistinct]. 
  Because of the possibility of the enemy gunners redirecting 
their attacks from [words indistinct] to the city center, we 
warn the residents of Sarajevo strictly to follow the measures 
envisaged for [words indistinct]. Members of the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs have issued a statement for the citizens [words 
indistinct] in their houses. Therefore, we warn the citizens 
once again to take all necessary measures [words indistinct].

  [Text] According to information from the 3d Corps press 
center, both aggressors [Serbian and Croatian] have intensified 
artillery attacks against the upper region of the Vrbas River. 
They also shelled the area with Maljutka missiles. The 
Ustashas used all artillery pieces to shell Gornji Vakuf, while 
they launched primitive explosive devices at Stari Vitez. 
Regrouping and reinforcement of Ustasha forces has been sighted 
in the area of Zepce. The Chetniks from Mt. Ozren are sending 
reinforcements to Novi Seher. 
  The Zvornik free territory is again under fierce artillery 
fire from the Serbian aggressor. Yesterday, in the course of 
the afternoon, the remains of the once beautiful Zaseok were 
destroyed with tank shells fired from Klisica and the 
surrounding hills. This morning, the Chetniks continued their 
provocations against the lines of the 206th Chivalrous Brigade. 
Its troops are in position and are ready to resist all attacks. 
  The autonomists' army continues its provocations in the 
Bihac 
region. Yesterday's attempt at an infantry breakthrough was 
decisively repelled by the 5th Corps units. Fikret's [Abdic] 
paramilitary is concentrating its forces which means that they 
are preparing a new offensive. Our army's defenders are ready 
for it. 
  In the Seven South Operative Group zone of responsibility, 
the enemy today targeted civilian targets in Maglaj and provoked 
the defense lines of the independent Tesanj Battalion. New 
forces are being brought in toward the region of Novi Seher, 
which means that new attacks are in preparation. What 
particularly worries the 120,000 citizens and refugees in the 
area is the lack of food, medicine, and energy. 
  In the Second Operative Group zone of responsibility, the 
Serbian aggressor has intensified artillery activity. The enemy 
is targeting the free territories of Doboj and Gracanica. This 
morning he attempted an infantry breakthrough that was 
decisively repelled by the 109th Doboj Brigade.

<F P=106> [Report by 4th Corps press center] </F>
  [Text] Today, at around 1200 the troops of the Croatian 
Defense Council [HVO] and the Croatian Army directed fierce 
mortar fire at the central parts of the city and the Mostar 
district of Madoljice. Three people were seriously injured as a 
consequence of the aggressor's activity. Today the Ustashas 
used 120-mm mortars to fiercely pound the demarcation lines and 
the residential areas in Bilo Polje, while the region of Bijelo 
was the target of multiple rocket launchers. The district of 
Blagaj was again exposed to artillery attacks perpetrated by the 
HVO and Croatian Army troops. 
  By accusing the [Bosnia-Herzegovina] Army of allegedly 
regrouping forces in the region of Blagaj -- as has been 
reported by the Croatian media -- the Ustashas are looking for 
an alibi for the daily shelling of this district and crimes 
committed against the civilian population, as well as for the 
attacks that they are obviously preparing to undertake against 
the free parts of the territory controlled by the 4th Corps 
forces.

  [Excerpt] One of the most active Bosnia-Herzegovina 
battlefields is still Cazin Krajina. A correspondent of Serbian 
Banja Luka Television today reports about fierce internecine 
Muslim fighting. The news is that Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 
forces have launched a seemingly successful counteroffensive. 
  [Unidentified Banja Luka TV correspondent] Following fierce 
attacks by artillery and infantry, members of the 5th Corps of 
the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina Army today inflicted this 
year's first defeat on the autonomist army. In fighting that 
continued all last night and this morning, Alija Izetbegovic's 
soldiers seized all strategically important sites around 
Pecigrad in the municipality of Cazin, shifting their lines by 1 
km toward Velika Kladusa, a town in which around 1,000 citizens 
of Pecigrad found shelter before the onslaught of Izetbegovic's 
killers today. 
  Internecine Muslim fighting also took place near Buzim 
today, 
where the combatants of the 5th Corps occupied the villages of 
Sestanovci and Marjanovici. Both sides have reported dozens of 
casualties. [passage omitted]

UN Protection Forces, by an unidentified correspondent on 5 
January; place not given--recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Blue Helmets have had 
enough: OUEST FRANCE reveals this morning that one of them, a 
Frenchman, killed a Serbian sniper on Christmas Day who had been 
terrorizing a district of Sarajevo. Listen to what General Cot 
had to say about this in an interview granted to Radio France 
Internationale this morning. The line is not very good, but his 
comments are important: 
  [Cot] One cannot retaliate with weapons as an answer to 
anything, but there is no doubt that the rules of our mission 
not only allow us to retaliate, but they demand that we 
retaliate. I have often repeated this to my men, when we are 
attacked directly and when the attacker has been identified 
beyond doubt. Believe me, even if we do not shout it on the 
rooftops every time it happens, we have retaliated on numerous 
occasions. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Do you confirm that a French 
Blue Helmet killed a Serbian sniper on Christmas night? 
  [Cot] I do not wish to give much publicity to these actions 
that, you will understand, must remain discreet. We have 
indeed, however, set up an anti-sniper device that should allow 
us--which already allows us--to make cowards think, those 
cowards who shoot at women, children, and also at soldiers 
[words indistinct]. I would like sniper alley--which in the end 
reinforces hope a little--to be called bastards alley. [passage

  [Excerpts] Muslim forces are continuing to bring in 
reinforcements and equipment in the Lasva Valley and are 
stepping up troop movements, which leads to the conclusion that 
a new offensive in this area is in the offing. This is reported 
by the Political Department of the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna's defense ministry. [passage omitted] 
  At a news conference today, Jadranko Prlic, the prime 
minister of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, reiterated the 
demands contained in the Croatian Government's letter on the 
overall reassessment of relations with the Muslim leadership in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. He justified this by saying that 
Izetbegovic is continuing the Muslim offensive against the 
Croat-populated areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  He stressed that the Muslim leadership has stolen from the 
other two peoples everything that made Bosnia-Herzegovina an 
internationally recognized state. All Bosnia-Herzegovina 
consulates in the world are purely Muslim. Mr. Prlic cited the 
example of the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina Embassy in Zagreb, 
where all 127 employees are of Muslim nationality. The world is 
beginning to realize that Izetbegovic is an aggressor, not a 
victim. Is the evacuation of Croats from central Bosnia being 
planned, a foreign correspondent asked Mr. Prlic. The reply was 
emphatic: 
  [Begin Prlic recording] As I said in my introductory 
address, 
we shall defend those regions at any cost. Vitez, Busovaca, 
Novi Travnik, part of the Travnik municipality -- the 
Owen-Stoltenberg plan envisages these areas as a constituent 
part of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. Therefore, we will 
do all we can to defend these areas. [end recording] 
  We had to pay a bloody price for our alliance with the 
Muslims, but despite everything, we are ready to negotiate with 
both the Muslims and the Serbs. The international boundaries of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina have been clearly defined, while the internal 
ones depend on how large an area can be defended, Jadranko Prlic 
pointed out.

<F P=106> [HABENA/HINA report: "Protection for the Croats Outside </F>
Herceg-Bosna"] 
  [Text] At the Tuesday [28 December] session in Siroki 
Brijeg, members of the Central Committee of the HDZ [Croatian 
Democratic Community] for Bosnia-Herzegovina supported the 
decisions made by the HDZ Presidency on 10 December relating to 
changes in the statute and organizational and personnel changes 
in the HDZ Executive Committee. Following the speech of HDZ 
President Mate Boban concerning the political and security 
situation and the negotiations on Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
committee declared themselves in favor of a persistent seeking 
of a peaceful solution to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but 
also ordered all the bodies of the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna to do everything for a successful defense of the 
Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna from aggression. 
  The political declaration of the HDZ was also adopted at the 
session, in which it is stated that "the HDZ is the main and 
almost the only political force of the Croatian people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina," and that under its leadership, "the 
Croatian people have managed to defend from the Serb, as well as 
the Muslim, aggression most of the populated territory, thus 
gaining the right to the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, which 
has a vital and strategic importance for the Croatian people." 
  The HDZ supports the "providing of an equal status of the 
Croats and the other peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croat 
republic of Herceg-Bosna, in the union of republics of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, a democratically organized Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna that will guarantee and secure all the rights and 
freedoms to every citizen," the integral city of Mostar as the 
capital of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, the protection, 
improvement, and security of all the rights of the Croats as 
"the precondition for stopping the eviction of the Croats, 
securing the return of the refugees and displaced persons," and 
also "the building of firm principles of protecting the Croats 
who remain outside the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna on a 
reciprocal basis, regarding the rights of the other two peoples 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
  Among the decisions listed in the declarations, it was 
stated 
that the HDZ will continue to support the ending of the war 
through political negotiations, the protection of the rights of 
the Croatian people and just peace, and, in cooperation with the 
international community, a permanent political solution for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially on the basis of the latest 
initiative of the European Union and the peace initiative of the 
president of the Republic of Croatia, Dr. Franjo Tudjman, on an 
equal basis for determining the rights of each of the three 
peoples: Croats, Muslims, and Serbs, especially on the basis of 
territorial demarcation. The HDZ considers unconditional 
observance of the international war and humanitarian law, the 
disclosing and punishment of war crimes, regardless of who the 
perpetrators are, and the free passage and delivery of 
humanitarian aid on the entire territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
to be obligations no one can be exempt from. The HDZ will 
retain its political influence through new forms of 
organizational solutions and appointments of new people, as well 
as improving the political unity of the Croatian people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and implementing the tasks contained in the 
program through political activities.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic by </F>
'AQIDATI correspondent Jamal Salim, during the former's visit 
to Cairo "last week"] 
  [Text] [Salim] What are the latest developments on the 
battlefield? 
  [Ganic] Praise be to God, the Muslim fighters are standing 
fast against the Serbo-Croatian aggression and the international 
plot against us. More than 100,000 Muslims are fighting with 
small-caliber weapons and few large-caliber weapons that they 
seized from the Serbs and Croats. The international plot 
continues. The arms embargo continues against us while arms 
supplies continue to reach the enemies before the eyes and ears 
of the whole world. It's an embargo imposed on the victim while 
the aggressor continues to receive arms to complete the plot and 
uproot Islam from Europe because Islam represents the thorn in 
Europe's side. Accordingly, the Europeans seek to obstruct the 
establishment of a European Islamic state in modern history, 
even if this would mean the annihilation of the entire Muslim 
people. 
  We have become hostages on our own land, because the UN 
forces cannot protect us or even protect themselves. The UN 
forces cannot carry out the task that they have been entrusted 
with and they also cannot protect the humanitarian relief 
convoys. Furthermore, it was recently revealed to the world 
that these forces have harassed Bosnian women. Nevertheless, 
the Muslims have scored various victories on several fronts. 
But the Western media have purposely concealed these victories 
so that the Muslims would feel that the Bosnian cause is dead. 
  [Salim] What are the most significant attacks to which the 
Muslims have so far been exposed? 
  [Ganic] No doubt the principal objective behind all the 
attacks is to wipe out Islam regardless of the price. The rape 
of women and children falls within this context. There is also 
an attempt to obliterate the Islamic identity by deliberately 
killing Muslim ulema, burning Islamic books and schools, and 
destroying more than 800 mosques. Muslim towns and villages 
have been devastated as a result of the mass annihilation 
campaign. Nonetheless, we continue to cling to our Islamic 
ethics when we deal with the Serbian and Croatian prisoners. We 
have never tortured any prisoner. This was very much 
appreciated by some prisoners, who converted to Islam in view of 
its tolerance and its care of human dignity despite their 
atrocities and annihilation campaign. 
  [Salim] What about the partition plan and the ongoing peace 
negotiations? 
  [Ganic] The international plot is clear through the share of 
the land earmarked for the Muslims. We have rejected the share 
because it is not proportional with the percentage of our 
population, which is 45 percent. We will only accept a just 
peace that would safeguard our usurped rights regardless of the 
sacrifices and losses. 
  I believe that the protracted peace negotiations are a waste 
of time because the Serbs and Croats continue to ignore the 
repeated appeals to stop the fighting. The negotiations aim to 
impose fait accompli because the international negotiators and 
mediators are wasting time. The proposed partition plan will 
lead to the displacement of 60 percent of Muslims. 
  [Salim] How have you prepared for the freezing winter under 
the difficult conditions that the Bosnian Muslim fighters and 
refugees are going through? 
  [Ganic] Actually, the tragedy is much greater than the 
resources available, something that has led to the martyrdom of 
hundreds of elderly people, children, and wounded people because 
of a shortage of relief supplies and medical aid. The Muslims 
are torn between the shelling and the freezing winter on the one 
hand and the shortage of supplies as a result of the repeated 
Serbian and Croatian attacks on the other hand. So what can we 
do in these conditions that are too tough for anybody to endure? 
The time has come for the Islamic countries to coordinate and 
cooperate among themselves to come to our rescue. All the 
Islamic states are responsible before God for their shortcomings 
toward us. Thus, I appeal to Islamic states to employ their 
financial and human resources as well as their diplomatic 
relations to put an end to the shedding of Muslim blood in 
Europe before we are all annihilated. This is because in such a 
case, Islam would never rise again in Europe and would be lost 
the way Islamic Spain was lost before. Faced with the current 
situation, there is nothing we could do other than hold on to 
God's words: "No soul but God can lay it bare" and "Verily God 
will defend from ill those who believe." 
  [Salim] What about your visit to Egypt? 
  [Ganic] I came to Egypt because it represents a great source 
of momentum in defense of our cause, in view of its good 
relations with the major states that have the power to adopt 
international resolutions. Egypt has a major role to play as a 
torchbearer of Islam, the home country of al-Azhar, and the 
country where every Muslim who suffers from injustice and 
oppression takes refuge. We hope that in the near future 
Egypt's good relations with the major states will bear fruit and 
the conspiracy against the Bosnian Muslims will cease. 
  [Salim] The media has reported divisions among the Muslims 
of 
Bosnia. How true is this? 
  [Ganic] These were just some differences in views, but they 
are over, thank God. All Muslims are now united in the face of 
aggression, because the deluge will not spare any Muslim. Thus, 
we are now united, thank God, under a single leadership and 
there are no divisions as the Western media have reported. 
These media have exaggerated the matter as if it were an 
inter-Muslim war. I warn Muslims all over the world that the 
conspiracy against Bosnia is not the end of the conspiracy 
against Islam in Europe, but rather the first one that will be 
followed by others in the future.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mile Akmadzic, minister for interrepublican </F>
and international relations for the Croatian republic of 
Herceg-Bosna and former prime minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina, by 
Ante Suljak; place and date not given: "Boban Is President, I 
Remain Minister...."] 
  [Text] [Suljak] Mr. Akmadzic, you and Hrvoje Sarinic, head 
of the [Croatian] president's National Security Council, 
recently attended talks with the Serbian side in Belgrade. What 
did you discuss? 
  [Akmadzic] It is correct that Mr. Hrvoje Sarinic and I 
visited Belgrade at the initiative of the cochairmen of the 
peace conference, Owen and Stoltenberg. In Belgrade, we held 
talks with Serbian representatives, the leaders of Serbs from 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Radovan Karadzic, Momcilo Krajisnik, and 
Nikola Koljevic. The talks were also attended by the 
representatives of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic and Foreign 
Minister Vladislav Jovanovic. The talks were also attended by 
some other important persons, the cochairmen of the peace 
conference, and some members of their expert teams. 
  All issues that burden Croatian-Serbian relations in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina were discussed, such as the issue of 
delineation. We also discussed how to jointly approach the 
issue of concessions, the issue of making concessions, or, as 
this is referred to in the negotiations, territorial concessions 
for the Muslim Republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In this regard, 
the Serbian side was more obliged to make territorial 
concessions, while the Croatian side was obliged to consider 
concessions regarding an access to the sea. The talks, all 
aspects of the talks, so to speak, focused on these issues. The 
result of the talks was, we can call it, the joint proposal in 
Geneva made with the cochairmen for settling this issue, which 
was unfortunately not fully concluded and agreed on at the end. 
However, joint principles were established as to how to make 
concessions to the Muslim Republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Suljak] Could you tell us, without giving us a hard 
diplomatic answer, whether you returned from Belgrade satisfied? 
  [Akmadzic] No, I, personally, did not return satisfied from 
Belgrade. I must immediately stress that from Belgrade we went 
to Vienna where we held talks with Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime 
Minister Silajdzic and his aides. The talks that were held 
there focused on virtually the same topics and problems. These 
talks represent bilateral contacts, which, if I may say so, have 
been going on continuously between the negotiating rounds in 
Geneva and Brussels. We were not satisfied. I repeat, I 
personally was not satisfied. I am not satisfied because the 
Geneva-Brussels talks were again adjourned, because they ended 
without a final settlement. 
  I would like to use this opportunity to say that, apart from 
these talks, other continuous contacts between the Serbian and 
the Muslim sides are also maintained in Sarajevo, at the local 
airport. Therefore, what should be emphasized is that contacts 
among the three sides are being maintained all the time. The 
negotiations in Geneva happen periodically, after these 
contacts. Such contacts will continue to be maintained. I am 
not saying that the Belgrade meeting will be repeated, but 
contacts aimed at finding a lasting solution, establishing a 
cease-fire, and ending all hostilities will be maintained. 
<H5>  Joint Solution </H5>
  [Suljak] Did the Serbian and the Muslim sides demand from 
the Croatian side at these talks in Vienna and Belgrade anything 
else that the public does not know? Were there any new, 
additional demands at the expense of the Croatian side? 
  [Akmadzic] No, one cannot talk about something being 
demanded at the expense of someone else. I can say that all 
these talks were held in a good atmosphere. However, no one is 
demanding anything at the expense of someone else. We were 
trying to find a joint solution. Of course, every side is 
trying to get the best possible deal, which none of the three 
sides found very easy anyway. 
  [Suljak] How is it that you accompanied Hrvoje Sarinic and 
not, for instance, Mate Boban, especially in view of the fact 
that Radovan Karadzic represented the other side? 
  [Akmadzic] I was in the Croatian side because I am a Croat, 
if you want to know on whose side I am. 
<H5>  Without a Compromise </H5>
  [Suljak] No, we know that, but why was Mr. Boban not present 
at these talks? 
  [Akmadzic] I was chosen to go there, in agreement with Mr. 
Boban. Therefore, there was nothing unusual in this, except 
what was agreed. When the Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosna was 
founded, the need arose for the involvement of as many people 
from different positions as possible. 
  [Suljak] What is your comment on the increasingly frequent 
reports in some Croatian and foreign media on the replacement of 
Mate Boban, especially the articles that are already promoting 
you as the next top man in the Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosna. 
  [Akmadzic] I will not give you a diplomatic answer, but will 
be sincere, I have not been reading newspapers recently. I am 
very busy. I would not want to comment on this. Mr. Mate Boban 
is president of the Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosna and 
president of HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community]. These are his 
posts and this is what he is. I am minister for 
inter-republican and international cooperation. My job is also 
to act as a coordinator, so to speak, between the Croatian and 
Muslims sides and reestablish trust. I also perform certain 
jobs in the political body for relations between the Croats from 
Herzegovina and the Croats from Bosnia, that is, the political 
representative body in the future union of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
republics. I have too many jobs and I have no time to think 
about anything else. 
  [Suljak] So, no one approached you recently with the 
proposal to perform the duties of the top man of the Croatian 
republic of Herceg-Bosna in the future? 
  [Akmadzic] I have already told you, Mr. Mate Boban is 
president of the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna.

<F P=106> [Article by Mirza Hajric: "Two Steps Backward"] </F>
  [Text] The urgency, artificially created by the European 
Union, to establish peace in Bosnia generated great caution. 
Such a serious matter, a juggernaut of world politicians and 
European ministers, did not deserve to be hurried. For, hurry 
may lead to grave mistakes that, considering the present 
situation in Bosnia, would later be impossible to correct. 
  Rumors composed of news from various sources have increased 
the pressure even more. Russian sources say that the leadership 
of the Bosnian Serb extremists is no longer trusted, but that 
they demand confirmation from our authorities. The Russians 
used high diplomatic channels to inquire whether it was true 
that Prime Minister Silajdzic and Momcilo Krajisnik agreed to 
divide Sarajevo, destroy Butmir airport, and build a new airport 
for each side. Furthermore, we received information that the 
Serbs came to Geneva with a map on which east Bosnia is just a 
little bit bigger and nothing more. According to the same 
sources, Croatia is prepared to relinquish enclaves held by the 
HVO [Croatian Defense Council], but will not give up Neum. The 
Serbian-Croatian side arranged that access to the sea be solved 
via Prevlaka. 
<H5>  "Demands of Europe" </H5>
  The European Union, which, it seems, is pretending to hold 
the key to the decision this time, presented secret demands for 
"all three sides." The Serbs are required to give 3 to 4 
percent of the territory within the framework of the agreement 
made on the carrier "Invincible," to guarantee full freedom of 
movement around Sarajevo and the enclaves, to accept the modus 
vivendi, and to end the siege right away. European ministers 
said that the inflexible attitude of the Serbs is the main 
obstacle to peace. The Serbs were also warned that continued 
bombing of safe areas under UN protection would no longer be 
tolerated. 
  The Croats were told to grant access to the sea at Prevlaka 
and Ploce, and to allow using the port on the Neretva River. 
They were also advised to prepare an alternative in the area of 
the municipality of Neum that, at Klek, will give access to the 
sea, so that, in case of the divorce of the Bosnian republics, 
it will be an access to the sea for the Bosnian republic. 
Croatia was told that its international recognition would be at 
stake if it did not comply with this demand. It was also told 
that economic and trade relations with the European Union would 
be strained even further if it did not meet the requirements for 
the implementation of the final agreement. 
  The Bosnian leadership was asked to stop military activities 
by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army in central Bosnia and 
provocations on the demarcation lines in Sarajevo. 
  The negotiations were exceptionally unorganized this time. 
They were supposed to begin at 1200, instead of at 1100, but 
they actually began at 1430. As a matter of fact, our 
delegation was given the role of an observer. Throughout the 
day, the cochairmen of the peace process informed it of the 
progress of negotiations with the other two sides. And at 1800, 
it was announced that a new Serb-Croat proposal was completed, 
so Izetbegovic and Silajdzic met with Milosevic, Karadzic, and 
Krajisnik, in the presence of Owen and Stoltenberg. Then they 
presented the plan that gives 33.3 percent of the territory. It 
all sounded like the right road to peace, until they put the map 
on the table. 
  No one in our delegation expected to see something like 
that. 
We expected the one-third of the territory to be tied to those 
areas of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina that we are directly 
interested in, considering the real situation. That proposal 
did not comply with any concession we thought necessary. 
Eastern Bosnia, was not expanded significantly, although that 
had been promised. The map only showed the connection between 
Gorazde, Zepa, and Srebrenica. The same happened with west 
Bosnia. Not a word about returning the territory of Sanski 
Most, Kljuc, Prijedor.... 
  The access to the sea, as seen by Milosevic and Tudjman, 
has a very unnatural geographic silhouette. It is about 120 km 
away from the territory of the Bosnian republic. The road to 
Prevlaka, whose northern part of the peninsula is supposed to 
become our harbor, mostly goes along the Croatian-Montenegrin 
border, through a very difficult terrain, and that solution is 
more of a worry than the one that solves any problem. The 
Bosnian state delegation has no intentions of relinquishing 
Neum, for that territory belongs to Bosnia-Herzegovina and it is 
the only natural access to the sea. Indeed, there are some 
difficulties, like shallow waters or the fact that there is no 
harbor there, but no solution is ideal. Neum will be one of the 
main headaches of European ministers due to the stubbornness of 
Croatian President Tudjman. According to one proposal, Neum 
could also be under joint Bosnian-Herzegovinian authority, or, 
according to another, the United States could undertake to have 
a two-year administration until the final solution is found. 
<H5>  "Diluting the Agreement" </H5>
  We were most disappointed to see some questions that we 
considered solved opened for discussion again. Those questions 
concern Brcko and Doboj. After details of the two problems were 
explained, Silajdzic referred to the proposal as "two steps 
backward" and accused the Serbs of coming up with a new proposal 
every time, thus putting back the negotiations. Lord Owen 
agreed that it was frivolous for "sensible adults" to change 
solutions on which they had previously agreed. 
  According to the latest proposal, Brcko is cut off from the 
territory of the Bosnian republic by 12 to 15 km. Milosevic 
offered guaranteed access and territorial sovereignty at the 
Sava River. He said one must not allow that the connection 
between large Serbian territories in western and eastern Bosnia 
"hang" on a viaduct like a "cherry petal." There was much 
discussion about Brcko, but no agreement was reached. We 
insisted on keeping things as we had arranged much earlier. The 
solution for Doboj is supposed be significantly changed, 
naturally in favor of Karadzic. There was no agreement about 
that. We demand free use of the railway station and railway 
junction, as was previously arranged. 
  Regarding central Bosnia, there were also many changes in 
Milosevic's geographic vision of Bosnia. The Croatian 
"intestine in the stomach" of the Bosnian republic was made 
larger, but Milosevic proposed that Busovaca, Kiseljak, Kresevo, 
and Prozor belong to us, in order to round up the map of central 
Bosnia in the shape of a ball, and Serbia would somehow arrange 
with Croatia about some other concessions that would be 
acceptable. President Izetbegovic demanded that Novi Travnik 
and Vitez be assigned to the Bosnian republic. 
<H5>  "Serbian Peasant Sarajevo" </H5>
  Sarajevo is still one of the major problems. Karadzic is 
pushing his proposal on, as he says, "peasant Sarajevo," a 
parallel city between Rajlovac and Ilidza. He did not accept 
the two-year UN administration, because he said it would only 
postpone the undeferrable separation. According to the plan 
presented at the table, out of 3.2 percent of the area of 
Sarajevo in the total territory of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Republic, 2.3 percent would belong to the Bosnian republic. 
That includes 90 percent of the city of Sarajevo. We think 
that the problem of this proposal lies in communications. We 
want free flow of all communications -- and we offer the same to 
the Serbian side, in the form of roads and railroads toward the 
north (Vogosca and Ilijas) -- or the UN administration. Momcilo 
Krajisnik proposed that the city be divided in the direction 
east-west on banks of the Miljacka River. Krajisnik "sadly" 
deduced that the position of Sarajevo was ideal, but upside 
down, so that it would be really difficult to reach a solution. 
We repeated our demand for eastern Bosnia, i.e. several 
territories that would connect Sarajevo and eastern Bosnia 
(Zepce and Srebrenica to Gorazde, including Visegrad). 
  We were actually not talking about demands, but repeating 
what was agreed on principle with the European Union. We must 
only find the way to realize that. Definitely not the one 
Karadzic wants. In general, the plan is painfully 
implementable. By agreeing to this solution, we would accept 
the plan that would resettle about 300,000 people and perhaps 
another 500,000 would not be able to return to their homes. We 
refuse to withdraw from any of territories that we are holding. 
It seems that the entire campaign about peace in Bosnia as a 
Christmas gift for the Balkans and Europe is premature. However, 
it will be continued in Brussels, where Milosevic and Tudjman 
will be pressured by European ministers. Some of our leaders 
say that we are nevertheless much closer to peace than it seems.

  [Text] Zvornik, 4 Jan (TANJUG) -- Major General Milan 
Gvero, deputy commander of the main headquarters of the republic 
of Srpska's Army [VRS], told TANJUG today that not one UN 
Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] member has ever been hurt on 
Serb-held territory. At the same time, Gvero added, it is well 
known how many UNPROFOR troops have lost their lives or have 
been wounded in Muslim and Croat-controlled areas. 
  "Facts point to the inevitable conlusion that the Blue 
Berets 
are completely safe only on the territory of the republic of 
Srpska," Gvero stressed. According to him, "the Serbian side 
has so far displayed full cooperation in its dealings with 
members of international organizations and UNPROFOR." Gvero 
underlined that UNPROFOR's movements are always determined by 
previous agreement between the two sides and that, because of 
this, "there is absolutely no reason why the Serb side should be 
singled out as the party obstructing or preventing UNPROFOR's 
movements." 
  The deputy commander of the VRS main headquarters pointed 
out 
that top-level officers recently met General Francis Briquemont, 
UNPROFOR's commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that "it was 
noted with mutual satisfaction that a high degree of rapport has 
been established between the Serbian side and UNPROFOR." 
  "We expect soon to have a similar meeting with General Jean 
Cot, UNPROFOR's commander for former Yugoslavia, which will 
certainly be mutually beneficial," General Gvero assessed.

  [Text] Banja Luka, 4 Jan (TANJUG) -- A joint meeting of the 
radio stations of Banja Luka, Semberija and Majevica (Bijeljina) 
and Sarajevo -- the previous channel S, broadcast from Pale -- 
was held in Banja Luka today in connection with joint 
programming for a radio station in the republic of Srpska and 
the republic of Serb Krajina. 
  The joint programming will start on 17 January and implies 
joint broadcasts every working day between 0800 GMT and 1200 
GMT. Between these times each studio -- Banja Luka, Bijeljina, 
Knin and Sarajevo (Pale) -- will produce one hour of programs. 
The news and current affairs programs will be joint programs 
because the news -- at noon and 1500 -- will go out from the 
Sarajevo (Pale) studio, while the 1900 cast will be broadcast 
from Banja Luka. However, the Banja Luka studio will broadcast 
a news bulletin at 1500 on its second program, and it will have 
its own daily news program at 1600. 
  Joint weekend broadcasts begin on 14 January. They will 
begin at noon on Saturday. They will end at 0600 the following 
day, and the studios will be changed in accordance with an 
established timetable. 
  In addition to establishing common programs, principles amd 
ways of exchanging information were established, as were other 
forms of joint work in the unified RS and RSK radio. The 
meeting was also to have been attended by representatives of 
Serb Radio Knin, but they will be informed by letter of the 
agreement on joint programming.

handled through the Foreign Ministry's Development Aid Section. 
  "Planning for distribution of the aid will start in January. 
The aid will partly consist of goods, partly personnel, and 
partly as direct support," said Humanitarian Aid Section Chief 
Ritva Jolkkonen. 
  Needs for the aid will be discussed with international 
relief 
agencies. This year aid has gone through the UNHCR (United 
Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees), the 
International Red Cross, and the World Health Organization (WHO). 
<H5>  Partly Goods, Partly Money </H5>
  Part of the aid will go as goods, part as money, since at 
its 
destination money is needed for purchasing fuel, etc. The aid 
sent through WHO will be in the form of medical equipment and 
such items as artificial limbs. Finnish experts can also be sent 
to Bosnia-Herzegovina with the aid money. "The intention is to 
act now in anticipation of winter needs," Jolkkonen stated.

  [Text] Budapest, January 4 (TANJUG) -- Vice-Premier of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Zeljko Simic said that he had 
agreed on Tuesday [4 January] with Vice-President of the Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Croatia Ivica Kostovic that a certain 
number of POW's would be exchanged on January 12. Simic, who 
also heads the Federal Committee for the Normalization of 
Relations with Croatia, told TANJUG that all controversial 
issues on the exchange of POWs had been resolved in the talks 
with Kostovic which had taken place in Budapest. 
  The talks covered the destiny of 999 Yugoslav citizens who 
disappeared in the territory of Croatia in 1991 (they are mostly 
members of the former Yugoslav army who were captured during the 
war for Croatia's secession from the former federation and were 
sentenced to long prison terms on groundless charges), while the 
Croatian side seeks information about some 700 people. Croatia 
informed the members of the Yugoslav delegation about the fate 
of a certain number of the listed persons, but there are no 
details about most of the missing. 
  Simic said that it had been agreed that the talks would 
continue on January 10 in Geneva with Croatian Vice-Premier and 
President of the Croatian Committee for the normalization of 
Relations with Yugoslavia Mate Granic. Simic assessed that 
today's talks in Budapest, during which the two sides also 
considered other humanitarian and controversial issues, `do not 
anticipate the resolving of political issues in relations 
between the two countries, but do create suppositions for such 
activities.' 
  The Geneva meeting with Granic will be a new chance to put 
on 
the agenda some other important questions of the normalization 
of overall relations between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
and Croatia, such as the re-establishment of telecommunications, 
highway and railway traffic, Simic specified.

  [Text] According to the information of the republican 
Health Care Headquarters, 141,605 people have been killed and 
160,000 wounded in Bosnia-Herzegovina since the beginning of the 
war. In Sarajevo alone, 9,662 have been killed, while over 
56,000 were wounded. During the Christmas cease-fire, 106 
people were killed and 470 wounded. Thirty-nine people were 
killed and 200 wounded in Sarajevo. This is stated in the 
statement of the republican Health Care Headquarters. Death 
from starvation is threatening displaced persons and the rest of 
the population in Tesanj, Maglaj, Olovo, Gorazde, Mostar, Tuzla, 
and other cities. Therefore, it is necessary to secure powdered 
milk and other dairy products for these areas, as well as fresh, 
dried, and canned fruits, powdered eggs, meat products, and 
fresh and canned vegetables.

  [Text] Tirana, January 6 (ATA) -- The spokesman of Tirana 
District Attorney's Office reports that the office had ordered 
December 31, 1993 the arrest of Veiz Haderi and Besim Veizaj, 
former heads of the branches of the interior of Saranda and 
Pogradec during 1988-1990 period. Contrary to their competences 
they had illegaly obeyed the orders of former ministers of the 
interior in regard to the rules of defending the border. 
Through their bad behaviours they have violated the personality 
of man and have mistreated different persons who have tried to 
cross the state borders and have walked the borders victims 
before crowds of people. 
  In the summer of 1990, although communist dictatorship had 
declared that border crossing was no longer considered treason, 
hundreds of young boys and girls who attempted to cross the 
border were killed. A total of 80-110 persons were killed 
during 1989-1990, according to experts. 
  The trial of Engjel Thoma, former commander of the border 
guards of Samrisht, Shkodra District was held on October 27, 
1993. Six young Albanians were killed in 8 months' time in 1990 
in the border center. Official figures on the murders of 
Albanians are expected to be higher. 
  Various reports published in the Albanian press over the 
last 
three years show that senior officials of former state security 
and former President Alia are responsible for these murders.

<F P=106> ["Power Industry Chief Shervashidze: `I Am a Nuclear </F>
Lobbyist'" -- BTA headline] 
  [Text] Sofia, January 5 (BTA) -- "If we do not start 
construction of a new power station within a couple of years, we 
will have to pay through the nose," Nikita Shervashidze, 
chairman of the Power Engineering Committee, says in an 
interview for the 24 CHASA daily. He adds that no power plant 
except the Chaira Pumped Storage Power Station has been under 
construction since 1990 and that in three to four years time the 
Maritsa Iztok 1 Thermoelectric Power Station and some other 
minor thermal power plants will be closed down. According to 
Mr. Shervashidze, a nuclear as well as some conventional types 
of generating facilities should be built in Bulgaria. At the 
same time, he believes that the current 40 percent proportion of 
nuclear power in electricity production is the optimum and 
should be maintained. According to Mr. Shervashidze, it would 
be more profitable to build an N-plant but this would take at 
least six years and the only feasible site is in Belene (where a 
new nuclear power plant went under construction back in the 
1980's and was put into cold storage in 1990 for lack of money 
and under environmentalists' pressure). 
  The chairman of the Power Engineering Committee denies press 
allegations of the existence of a "nuclear Mafia" in Bulgaria 
but says he himself belongs to a nuclear power lobby campaigning 
to convince the government and people in this country of the 
excellent prospects and the economic efficiency of nuclear 
energy in Bulgaria. 
  Further in his interview, Mr. Shervashidze says there are 
several projects for completion the second nuclear power plant 
in Belene (on the Danube). According to him, the site in Belene 
can accommodate six nuclear reactors of 1,000 megawatts each. 
The draft project envisaged two nuclear reactors of 1,000 
megawatts each, but later it became clear that 500-100 [as 
received] megawatt units suited better Bulgaria's energy supply 
system and their construction was feasible. 
  Nikita Shervashidze believes the motion by 14 MP's for a 
moratorium on the development of nuclear power engineering and 
the construction of nuclear facilities can not be serious. "A 
plant for recycling cool radioactive waste is being built and if 
such a moratorium is imposed, the construction will have to be 
stopped," Mr. Shervashidze says. 
  He points out that the construction of gas-powered stations, 
worth about $1,100-1,200 per kilowatt of installed capacity, is 
also possible in Bulgaria, but the high prices of imported gas 
raise the cost of such projects.

  [Text] Sofia, January 4 (BTA) -- Mr. Rumen Avramov, deputy 
chairman of the Agency for Economic Coordination and 
Development, an independent institution making annual and 
monthly analyses of the state of Bulgaria's economy, has 
predicted several price shocks in Bulgaria in 1994. He deems 
them imminent because they will release the piled-up but 
deferred inflationary potential in the fixed prices of electric 
power and fuels. Mr. Avramov does not expect hyperinflation. 
"I am hopeful the main levers of the economic policy will not 
defeat each other as was the case in 1993," he says. 
  In an interview in today's DUMA, Mr. Avramov attaches 
particular importance to income indexing. "Automatic indexing 
was the main culprit for tying the cabinet's hands in the field 
of budgetary policies and for the high deficit," he comments. 
  Mr. Avramov thinks possible outside funding will be of prime 
importance throughout the year as the country was placed in 
total economic isolation. He also points to other important 
events, like the entry into force in April of the VAT 
[value-added tax] Act, which is expected to entail a single 
price rise and will restructure the tax base of the budget. 
  Asked whether the monetarist model will have to be 
corrected, 
Mr. Avramov says the Bulgarian model is not a monetarist one 
"either as an ideology or least as real policies." "State-run 
enterprises are still functioning without fixed budget 
restrictions, though a great number of them have practically 
gone bankrupt," the deputy chairman of the Agency for Economic 
Coordination and Development explains.

  [Text] Sofia, January 5 (BTA) -- Significant structural 
transformations in banking will take place in 1994, while the 
National Bank of Bulgaria (BNB) will play a very important, even 
decisive role in the attainment of a crucial agreement: the new 
third standby arrangement with the International Monetary Fund, 
BNB Governor Prof. Todor Vulchev says in an interview in 
OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK. He adds that a comprehensive bank 
privatization strategy is yet to be worked out, but the bank's 
Governing Board has the ambition to consider a draft of a 
privatization programme by mid-January, coordinate it with the 
Bank Consolidation Company and jointly submit it to the 
government. Todor Vulchev thinks two or three major state-run 
banks may be privatized this year. Bank privatization will get 
under way and we want this to be done by mid-1994, the BNB 
governor states. Prof. Vulchev holds the hidden privatization, 
much talked about last year, was actually a succession of 
relatively small and insignificant offenses. The emergence of 
15 private banks is an asset, the BNB governor thinks. 
  On parliament's decision for the BNB to provide $300 million 
in backup to the deal on Bulgaria's debt to private creditors, 
Prof. Vulchev says the money is available. These are Bulgaria's 
foreign exchange assets in various foreign banks. "We can 
declare any time that the 300 million of our assets worth $750 
million have been allocated to the debt deal and no one is 
authorized to touch them. This does not mean, however, that we 
cannot operate with them painlessly," the BNB governor says in 
conclusion.

  [Text] Sofia, January 5 (BTA) -- The Confederation of 
Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria (KNSB) must be a priority 
concern for the National Council of Tripartite Cooperation, the 
confederation's Vice President Ivan Neykov told a news 
conference here today. KNSB, which is one of the two most 
influential labour amalgamations in the country, will probably 
come up with an official proposal on incomes policy countering 
the proposal of government experts, Mr. Neykov said. 
  After three months of work in the Tripartite Council's 
subcommittees, three fundamental differences still remain 
between the proposals of the government and the KNSB, the 
confederation's Executive Secretary Mr. Georgi Georgiev told the 
news conference. The KNSB rejects the cabinet-proposed method of 
adopting projected inflation as a key element in the overall 
incomes policy. The amalgamation's experts claim that the 45 
percent average annual inflation, projected for 1994, will be 
exceeded already at the start of the year. 
  The KNSB also sees as unacceptable the government-suggested 
options for cost-of-living adjustment of pensions. The 
mechanism which is proposed now could make it impossible to 
abolish adjustment supplements in future, Mr. Georgiev said. 
Another option suggests merely a revision of the base of 
pension calculation and a one-time rise without adjustment 
payments throughout the year. The KNSB believes this will lead 
to an economically and socially unjustified increase of the 
difference between the lowest and the highest pensions. The 
confederation will suggest an option which will retain the 
inflation-related indexation of pensions. This will create 
conditions for a complete abolition of cost-of-living adjustment 
supplements to pensions in 1995, Mr. Georgiev said. 
  The KNSB does not accept a method suggested by the Finance 
Ministry for wage formation and wage growth regulation in the 
state-financed sector. The amalgamation insists on guarantees 
of the availability of money for the payment of agreed wages in 
the state-financed sector irrespective of budget revenue, Mr. 
Georgiev said.

  [Text] Prague Jan 5 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic accepts 
U.S. President Bill Clinton's Partnership for Peace initiative 
aimed at gradually increasing cooperation between NATO and 
Eastern Europe, Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus told journalists 
today. Partnership for Peace offers Central and Eastern 
European countries closer military cooperation with NATO and 
envisages that they agree to gradual expanding of their 
cooperation with NATO and not insist on immediate admittance to 
the Alliance. 
  Klaus said these countries should bear in mind that for the 
United States and other NATO member states, Russia is a power 
which should be taken into consideration. Klaus was reacting to 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's statement today in which he 
warned NATO of a possible negative reaction by the Russian 
public to NATO's probable expansion eastward. Yeltsin described 
the arguments of countries seeking membership in NATO as 
"unconvincing." 
  Klaus said he knew that "Russia considered this issue to be 
a 
sensitive one," but added that the question was not urgent 
because "nobody is offering us membership in NATO." 
  Klaus said that from the first moment when it become known 
that on his way from Brussels to Moscow Clinton will stop in 
Prague and meet representatives of the Visegrad countries -- the 
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland -- it was clear 
that the talks would be separate. Speculations that the Czech 
Republic was preventing or not preventing coordinated talks to 
be held are superfluous, he added. 
  Klaus was thus reacting to reports which appeared in the 
Czech and foreign media that the Czechs do not support the idea 
of joint talks between high-ranking Visegrad officials and 
Clinton during his January 11-12 visit to Prague. 
  At its meeting today, the Czech Government approved the 
programme of Clinton's stay in Prague. The U.S. delegation will 
meet for bilateral talks with delegations of the four Visegrad 
countries. Bilateral talks between Klaus and the Polish, Slovak 
and Hungarian premiers will take place in Hrzansky Palac. 
  After Clinton's departure from Prague on January 12, Czech 
President Vaclav Havel, Klaus and Czech Foreign Minister Josef 
Zieleniec will give separate dinners for their Visegrad 
colleagues, Klaus said.

  [Text] Prague Jan 4 (CTK) -- Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus 
does not view state administration reform through the eyes of a 
financier, he said on Czech Radio today. "It is the last 
viewpoint I am taking into consideration at the moment," he 
added. 
  Klaus said, however, that such an approach could prove to be 
no good as "every such interference costs something." "I have 
an impression that I should play a role of a financier at the 
moment and start counting how much it will cost," Klaus said. 
He added, however, that the idea of state administration reform 
demanded "deeper discussion." 
  The supposition that "all things should always be done 
closer 
to citizens, is only half correct," Klaus said. "It is 
certainly not true that we should conduct foreign policy closer 
to the people and solve the basic problems of the army and this 
country's defence closer to the people," Klaus said. 
  He said he firmly believed the government would manage to 
resolve "the deepest conceptual questions" connected with the 
reform during January and would meet the timetable set for state 
administration reform. That means that draft proposal for 
competitions to be invested into higher self-governing units 
would be completed, he said. 
  Speaking about the role of the state in society, Klaus said 
this role should be "extremely small." He added, however, that 
as a representative of the state he could not consider the state 
its major enemy but should on the contrary try to do his utmost 
for the state to function well and bring "something positive to 
the people." 
  Klaus said that the opportunities for businessmen in the 
Czech Republic to make a profit without offering the right 
quality of their goods or services were diminishing and this 
process was irreversible. He said ethics and morality on one 
side and a market economy on the other do not exclude each other 
but are interconnected. "Any attempts to separate these things 
are bad... because they are the two sides of one coin," Klaus 
said.

  [Text] Prague Jan 3 (CTK) -- According to preliminary 
calculations, 1993 has come to a close with a slight budget 
surplus, Finance Ministry Spokesperson Ludmila Nutilova told CTK 
today. 
  She added that in a speech today, Finance Minister Ivan 
Kocarnik told ministry staff that few countries can boast of a 
budget surplus, and the Czech Republic is the only country 
undergoing transformation that has a surplus. The surplus, he 
said, is a sign of successful economic transformation, 
especially as the new tax system was instituted and enforced 
with no loans from the state.

  [Text] Prague Jan 4 (CTK) -- Premier Vaclav Klaus today 
announced a 1993 state budget surplus of about half a billion 
crowns attributed in part to the fact that the state received 
about three billion crowns more than anticipated. 
  Klaus considers the high state revenue of about 357 billion 
crowns "an extraordinary success," especially since 1993 was the 
country's first year of existence, and during the year radical 
tax reforms were instituted. 
  He cautioned that the data are not yet definitive because 
until January 15 the state can receive bills for 1993, but only 
for relatively small sums. He added that the gross national 
product (GNP) growth for 1993 was about zero percent. 
  Klaus stated that the funds from the budget surplus would 
not 
be used for advances on reparations for Czech victims of the 
Nazis, as proposed by Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec. That 
proposal has not yet been submitted for "serious" discussion, 
Klaus said.

  [Text] Prague Jan 5 (CTK) -- The Czech Government today 
granted almost 20 million crowns (680,000 USD) to support 
minority newspapers and magazines, a government spokesman 
announced. A similar grant in 1993 amounted to 18.5 million 
crowns. 
  The Polish, Ukrainian, German, Hungarian, Romany and Slovak 
minority press will benefit from the grant, Premier Vaclav Klaus 
said. The government also approved setting up 150 individual 
grants, to be created by 1996, for third world students wishing 
to take up university-level study, the government spokesman said.

  [Text] Prague Jan 3 (CTK) -- A third editor of the weekly 
newspaper NECENZUROVANE NOVINY (Uncensored News) has brought 
suit against President Vaclav Havel in a Prague court, this time 
for defamation of character. 
  In his accusation, Editor Vladimir Pavlik claimed that Havel 
defamed him while testifying in court December 14 during his 
trial against two other editors, Petr Cibulka and Lubomir Vydra, 
who had charged Havel with making slanderous remarks against the 
newspaper. During his testimony, Havel called NECENZUROVANE 
NOVINY a "sewer spreading lies and hatred" and a "disgrace to 
our independent press." 
  Pavlik said that "since I publish regularly in the newspaper 
at issue and my name is listed in the staff box, it follows from 
my opponent's statements that my articles are spreading lies and 
hatred." 
  In consequence, he has suggested that the court order Havel 
to publish in all newspapers which published his original 
statements the following text: "The articles by Vladimir Pavlik 
in NECENZUROVANE NOVINY do not spread lies and hatred, and are 
not a disgrace to our independent press. The texts of these 
articles proves that if I were a moral and upstanding citizen, 
by virtue of my position as president I could have done much in 
the service of truth and democracy. That I have not testifies 
not only to my cowardice and positive relations to the 
perpetrators of communist-StB [State Security] crimes, but to 
the fact that for many years as a self-styled intellectual I had 
no possibility for self-realization."

  [Text] Prague Jan 4 (CTK) -- If Europe is capable of 
coping with the problems of laundering dirty money, crime, tax 
evasions and others, "we will cope with them as well," Czech 
Economics Minister Karel Dyba says in the latest issue of the 
Czech weekly MLADY SVET. He does not dismiss the information 
that the amount of dirty money -- originating from tax and 
customs evasions, sales of smuggled goods and drugs -- reaches 
some 25 million USD [U.S. Dollars] on Czech territory. "25 
million USD seems to be a big amount, but it is negligible in 
percentage," Dyba states. He explains that it makes up some 0.1 
percent of the total of 600 billion crowns (about 20 billion 
USD) annually loaned by the banking sector to the economy. "Of 
course... it is necessary to strive to eliminate the existence 
of any dirty money. But not at any cost, as we must not 
discourage the `pure' money, which might flow out from our 
banks," Dyba stresses. 
  Asked what the real problems of the Czech economy in 1993 
were, Dyba says that "from the point of view of healthy economic 
growth," he considers "emerging new internal relations within 
enterprises one of the problems." Others are the slow pace of 
courts' giving rulings, excessive bureaucracy, and others, he 
adds. Dyba states that "social consensus still exists in our 
country." He defines it as an agreement by most people with the 
reform, with the fast tempo set by the state. 
  "I think that this government not only speaks about a market 
economy without social attributes for instance, but it also 
promotes it in practice," Dyba emphasises. But on the other 
hand, the government cares for changes such as further 
liberalisation of prices to be scheduled evenly and for 
compensation for them to be paid "to certain layers of society, 
which objectively, in the present phase of economic development, 
need it,... to people who are objectively handicapped in some 
way," Dyba says. "Although the Czech Republic is carrying out 
massive changes, which took Western Europe a decade to be 
realised, within a far shorter time, most people accept this," 
Dyba states. He praises the people who "have realised that 
nobody would do anything for them, that the world is opened up 
for them, that they have a chance, but that they have to strive 
hard if they want to be successful. This is of key importance," 
Dyba stresses. 
  Asked what he thinks about the country's prospects for 1994, 
he says that he expects the price rises to be the lowest of all 
reform years (since 1990), and not to surpass 10 percent. Dyba 
says that if he were an independent economist, he would make his 
own estimate of economic growth in 1994, but being a politician, 
he sticks to the government prediction of a 2 to 3 percent 
growth in the gross domestic product. He stresses that growth 
depends on many circumstances, including improvement of the 
competitiveness of the Czech economy. "We do not expect any 
essential changes such as the introduction of a new taxation 
system and the split of the republic... this is favourable for 
the economic growth," Dyba says. 
  "Unemployment will slightly rise but not dramatically," he 
states, adding that he expects this to "be positive in a certain 
sense, mainly with regard to better labour discipline which 
usually accompanies the increase in unemployment." Dyba says he 
is not one of those considering bankruptcies an essential 
question and insisting that no key change can be made without 
enterprises going bankrupt. "Bankruptcies will simply come and 
I hope that they will be in proportion to the general economic 
development. I would particularly like the dynamic sector of 
small- and medium-sized businesses to develop, and a number of 
big enterprises to be reshaped," Dyba says. 
  Asked what the results of the next parliamentary elections 
slated for 1996 he expects, Dyba says he believes that the 
latest 1992 election winner, the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), 
of which he is a member, will be successful again. It will 
require hard work which would result in everybody benefiting 
from good economic developments," he concludes in MLADY SVET.

  [Text] Prague Jan 4 (CTK) -- Overall returns from small 
privatisation, which was completed on December 31, 1993, reached 
35.1 billion crowns (over one billion USD) [U.S. Dollars], 
National Property Fund Chairman Tomas Jezek says in today's 
issue of the daily CESKY DENIK. A total of 3.9 billion crowns 
of that have thus far been spent. Administrative costs such as, 
for example, those for privatisation commissions, were 240 
million crowns, while 450 million crowns was spent on 
depreciated property returned to its original owners. 
  Settlement of liquidation consequences of state-owned 
companies have thus far demanded close to 2 billion crowns. 
Town councils obtained a one-time payment of 1.2 billion crowns 
as compensation for enterprises which represented income for 
local budgets and were privatised or restituted. The net 
balance from the process is 31.2 billion crowns, of which 20 
billion has been deposited long-term, the interest of which is 
to be used in the privatisation of health care, Jezek concluded.

  [Text] Prague Jan 4 (CTK) -- Losses in Czech agriculture 
in 1993 can be roughly estimated at between 8.1 and 8.3 billion 
crowns (about 275,000 USD), the daily HOSPODARSKE NOVINY writes 
today. The data, obtained from the director of the Research 
Institute for Agricultural Economics, Josef Kraus, resulted from 
the institute's analysis and are preliminary. 
  Of the loss, 4.14 billion crowns was generated by state 
farms 
and 2.24 billion crowns by agricultural cooperatives. Private 
farmers showed the best results: They showed a profit when 
compensation for the work of the farmer and family members are 
not included. 
  Businesses involved in agricultural primary production saw a 
loss of 384 million crowns, while other agricultural companies, 
such as school farms, ended up with 1.2 to 1.4 billion crowns in 
aggregate losses. 
  Debts owed by the farms worsen the situation. They total 
42.2 billion crowns, more than twice the amount of claims -- 
19.7 billion crowns.

  [Text] Budapest, 5 January (MTI) -- Hungarian Minister of 
Defence Lajos Fur, in an interview in the breakfast television 
program "Napkelte" (Sunrise), said he is unable to fulfil the 
request of the opposition, namely to refrain from implementing 
changes in the army leadership until the elections. Fur said 
there is a valid measure which he wishes to observe, whereby 
soldiers reaching the age of 55 should be pensioned off. This 
rule will affect three or four generals until by the time of the 
elections. 
  The minister did not mention names, however, Colonel-General 
Kalman Lorincz, commander of the Hungarian Army, will turn 55 in 
February, 1994. A decision on relieving him will be made by the 
president of the republic, on proposal by the minister of 
defence, as is set down in the Defence Law which came into force 
on January 1. The new Defence Law also sets down that one 
person can fulfil the positions of commander and chief of staff. 
Observers believe that Lieutenant-General Janos Deak, the 
current chief of staff of the Hungarian Army, would fulfil these 
two functions in the future.

  [Text] Budapest, 31 December (MTI) -- Hungarian defense 
spending has dropped by almost half in real terms since 1989, 
with its share in the gross domestic product [GDP] down from 2.5 
percent to 1.88 percent, a recent publication entitled HONVEDSEG 
'93 (Home Defence '93) reveals. The Hungarian Army consists of 
exactly 100,000 people at the end of 1993. Of these, 13,700 are 
officers, 8,500 other ranks, 52,340 private soldiers, and 25,660 
civil employees. Three years ago the number of people employed 
by the defense forces totalled 143,200. The Army currently has 
1,229 tanks, 1,296 armored vehicles, 1,023 pieces of artillery, 
171 fighters, and 39 attack helicopters. (The air defense units 
come under Army control in Hungary.) 
  Tanks numbers have been reduced by over 100 in the year, 
with 
armored vehicles numbers down by more than 400. Currently only 
the number of tanks exceeds the limit fixed at 835 by 
international agreements. As the defense budget has been 
decreasing in real terms for several years, there is an ever 
tighter rein on money for development, which represented 19 
percent of all spending in 1990, but a mere 7.6 percent this 
year. The defense forces consider 30-40 percent budgeted for 
development would be ideal.

  [Text] Budapest, 5 January (MTI) -- Compared to the record 
high in March, 1993, the number of unemployed declined by 
50,000, to 630,000 at the end of the year. According to the 
short-term forecast of the National Labor Center, the decline 
will continue in the first half of 1994, and the number of 
people out of work will stand at around 580,000. 
  Statistics indicate that the value of Hungarian industrial 
production rose by 4 percent in 1993. The number of unemployed 
declined from 680,000 in March (a rate of 13 percent), to 
630,000 (12.2 percent). 
  This, however, is not the total number of unemployed. Last 
year, the National Labor Center carried out a national survey on 
those left out of the registers because their unemployment aid 
is no longer granted (as they had been out of work for one 
year). The result was that 12 percent of the long-term 
unemployed were left out of the register without any financial 
aid. The forecast of the institution for the first six months 
of 1994 reckons with only 20,000 people who stand to lose their 
eligibility, which means that roughly 50,000 people will not be 
on the unemployment records, but will be out of work in the 
summer of 1994. 
  The short-term forecast covered 4,600 firms that employed 
about one-third of workers (1.7 million people) and predicts a 
decline of 50,000 in the number of registered unemployed to 
580,000, that is 11.4 percent of the population in the working 
age group. 
  The analyses stresses that company manpower strategies have 
changed considerably in view of the boom taking shape in 
economy. The proportion of companies dismissing workers has 
steadily declined since the second half of 1992, and, in the 
second half of 1993, the number of economic units dismissing 
workers was less than those offering vacancies. 
  Company investment inclination also shows a steady rise, 
with 
18 percent of firms expanding capacities in the second half of 
1993. This proportion was significantly higher in industry, 
building industry, and servicing industry. The number of firms 
reporting growing orders is also on the rise. In the last 
quarter of 1993, the proportion of firms in a good or improving 
situation outnumbered that of firms in a lastingly poor or 
deteriorating situation, for the first time in two and a half 
years. 
  Demand will mainly increase for skilled workers, and more 
and 
more companies intend to employ first-time job seekers, which 
will improve the employment opportunities of this age-group (the 
rate of unemployment in the 16 to 25 age-group is 17 percent). 
  Figures indicate the boom also has beneficial effects on the 
territorial differences in unemployment, with employment 
opportunities showing the fastest rise in counties with the 
highest unemployment rates. 
  The analysis reckons with a further improvement in economic 
performance and, therefore, better employment opportunities as 
dismissals related to restructuring in industry, building 
industry and services is drawing to an end, after three years. 
However, in spite of the improving economic situation, the 
future of long-term unemployed persons unable to find work due 
to lack of qualifications or for health reasons, is still to be 
settled, experts note.

  [Text] Budapest, January 5 (MTI) -- The opposition 
Alliance of Free Democrats (AFD) regrets that Hungary's 
electoral law has been amended without settling the matter of 
parliamentary representation for minorities, Parliament Human 
Rights Committee Deputy Chairman Istvan Laszlo Meszaros of the 
AFD announced to the press today. 
  The AFD holds the government responsible for the failure and 
states that the bill, which required a two-thirds majority of 
votes, was improperly prepared. The AFD says the government 
ignored all suggestions from the liberal party. 
  According to the AFD, the government's original proposal 
would not have made it possible for all minorities to have 
parliamentary representation. Adopting it would have put 
minorities of smaller numbers into a detrimental position. 
Larger minorities would receive representation almost 
automatically, which would jeopardize the existence of the 
unicameral parliament. Furthermore, the "one minority -- one 
list" proposal ignored differences of political views within 
minorities. 
  According to the AFD's proposal, representatives of 
minorities would get a seat in Parliament by winning half of the 
votes usually necessary for an MP. Also, the proposal would 
give minorities outside of Parliament a right of consultation in 
Parliament's human rights committee. 
  The AFD seeks to launch coordination talks on minority 
parliamentary representation with the participation of the 
minority roundtable and parliamentary parties.

<F P=106> [Interview with Polish President Lech Walesa by Jas </F>
Gawronksi in Warsaw; date not given: "The President: `If the 
West Abdicates From its Role, the Former Soviet Bloc Will 
Reorganize Itself'"] 
  [Text] Warsaw -- When he was elected head of the Polish 
State, Lech Walesa restored an ancient chapel in the underground 
of the Belweder presidential palace that had formely been used 
by his communist predecessors, including General Jaruzelski, as 
a projection room. Where there was once a screen, there is now 
an altar in front of which Walesa kneels each morning at 7:30 
for Mass and Holy Communion. Then he goes back up the dark 
marble staircase covered by a fake Persian carpet leading 
directly to his office and to Poland's difficult problems. 
Today these problems consist primarily in the success of the 
right-wing nationalist extremists in the Russian elections. 
This election result has created real concern among the former 
communist countries of Europe, anxious to receive formal 
protection from NATO against Russia's new expansionism. To date 
Clinton has only offered the former satellite countries and 
Balkan states a vague "peace alliance" plan that does not 
satisfy their safety requirements when faced with the 
developments in Moscow. On the other hand, many people in 
Washington maintain that extending firm guarantees to these 
countries could mean destabilizing Yeltsin at this difficult 
time and strengthening the nationalistic tendencies, or else 
they are simply contrary to expanding U.S. commitment in Europe. 
All these problems will be discussed and decided upon in 
Brussels at a 10 January NATO meeting that is acquiring 
considerable importance for the future of the former communist 
Europe. Lech Walesa is convinced that the future of his country 
is being decided upon to some extent. 
  [Gawronksi] Mr. President, do the election results in Russia 
worry you? 
  [Walesa] Yes, but what worries me primarily is the inertia 
of 
Europe, its lack of insight, its imperviousnesss to the 
warnings, to the threats, that were and are more and more in the 
air. For some time I have been saying that it is in your 
interests, not ours, to expand the European Community, and that 
NATO should be expanded toward the East. Let me explain: There 
were two opposing blocs, one was the Soviet Union, which has 
been temporarily dissolved, and the other, the West, which is 
not getting bigger. What remains is a vacuum and politics does 
not tolerate vacuums. If Europe and NATO were to decide to 
gradually expand toward the former communist countries in Europe 
in the short term, six months at the most, then the field of 
confrontation would become smaller. Otherwise, we are back to 
square one: Russia will take the initiative, it will exert 
economic pressure upon us and other countries that are more 
important than Poland, such as Ukraine; we will have to give in 
to compromises, and the former Soviet bloc will be reformed, 
even if it is no longer a Soviet bloc, and this will lead to 
confrontation again. Russia already has unreliable politicians 
who are attempting to bribe NATO and the rest of the world! Now 
my question is: Why did we dissolve the Soviet Union, Comecon 
[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance], the Warsaw Pact. To 
remain alone and abandoned on a desert island? So, if Europe 
does not wake up, we will be back to square one in five or six 
years' time and this frightens me; because I don't know if 
there will be another person capable of creating a new 
Solidarity to set things right again. 
  [Gawronski] What should Europe do? 
  [Walesa] Follow the example of Clinton, who opened up to 
Mexico with the NAFTA accord regardless of the country's level 
of development: He realized it was in his interest to do so. 
And it is in Europe's interests to extend itself toward the 
East, encourage reforms, and invest. I have a theory: The cost 
of reforms is in proportion to the distance of those that are 
inspire them [sentence as published]. So you must start with 
Poland and the other East European countries and then go on to 
Russia and the countries of the former Soviet Union. We in 
Warsaw are giving a warning cry. We find ourselves in a 1939 
situation: People thought that the Germans wanted only Danzig, 
but they changed their minds when the Germans reached Paris. 
  [Gawronski] You were alluding to Poland's entry into NATO. 
But one of the problems is opposition by Russia. When Yeltsin 
was in Warsaw some months ago, he seemed to agree, you succeeded 
in persuading him, but when he returned to Moscow, he changed 
his mind. Why? 
  [Walesa] He was certainly influenced by his military, but I 
am sure he would not have changed his mind if the West had not 
been so lazy and inactive. In my meeting with Yeltsin I threw a 
ball into the West's court. When Yeltsin saw that the West 
failed to pick it up, that it did not want to play ball, that it 
was not interested in expanding toward the East, why should he 
have committed himself? Therefore I believe the West is to 
blame, not Yeltsin. 
  [Gawronski] But this bloc you forecast would be rather 
heterogeneous given the recent elections: Over to the far right 
in Russia, and with the former communists in power in Poland. 
  [Walesa] You people in the West judge everything according 
to 
your views and forget that we have not had political parties or 
democratic pluralism for 50 years. The former communists won in 
Poland not because they were communists but because they were 
more active and more well-prepared, more accustomed to managing 
power, than the others. They are ready to change their 
membership card from red to green, and then to blue and yellow 
and. The real question is: Will they be capable of 
accomplishing what they have promised? I doubt so, and I think 
that the parties that identify primarily with the principles 
that were once those of Solidarity will have the time to prepare 
themselves, acquire experience, and then chase out the 
post-communists in the next elections. 
  [Gawronski] So, though you are worried about the results of 
the Russian elections, one could say that you are not concerned 
about the Polish ones? 
  [Walesa] Look, I think this is be an unavoidable experience 
and it is better to experience it now than in 10 years' time. I 
repeat, those who won are better prepared. They were the only 
ones who could be better prepared, because they held the 
monopoly of power in the past and presented themselves united. 
They moved in a single bloc while the others argued. I would 
have preferred to deal with others, but I think that neither 
myself, nor my children will ever see the communists in power in 
Poland. For the time being we must use them for what they are, 
to reach our objectives, reconstruction, reforms, while keeping 
them under control, naturally, to make sure that they do not 
invert their course and to be sure that they respect pluralism, 
liberty, and democracy. Before, communism was inevitable, now it 
can be used even for our purposes. 
  [Gawronski] And what about those who have been defeated, 
including yourself, how have they reacted to the victory of the 
former communists? 
  [Walesa] Now one can see that I was right when I said not to 
come down too heavily on the communists, not to dig up their 
past, because they would only take their revenge later. I 
opposed putting the left under too much pressure. Instead I 
helped it, to prevent it doing the same thing again if the 
opportunity arose. 
  [Gawronski] The pope, who has always been a reference point 
for you, has said that there is a basis of truth in communism. 
  [Walesa] Much can be said about the past, but one must 
recognize the fact that they were times of greater social 
equilibrium, without such bitter differences in the standard of 
living. Today there are people who are nostalgic for this past. 
But we must not be: We must decide. The change will be slow 
and difficult, but there is no going back. 
  [Gawronski] What political system would you like for your 
country? 
  [Walesa] I do not like capitalism but nothing better has 
been invented yet. I would like a humane capitalism, that takes 
account of the poor, the sick, the destitute, but that also lets 
the rich live in peace. 
  [Gawronski] Let us talk about yourself a little. The 
popularity polls are not very good. Are you worried? 
  [Walesa] I am certainly no Miss Poland and neither am I the 
primate of Poland, who has no political responsibility, which is 
why, among other things, he no longer appeals to the people. 
But I think that nobody has done for this country more than I 
have done. I am working for Poland and nobody can accuse me of 
having made mistakes. As for the polls, they are biased and are 
not important. 
  [Gawronski] Now you are a little alone here in Belweder 
palace. Do you ever finding yourself thinking with nostalgia 
about the times of Solidarity, your old friends Michnik, 
Geremek, Mazowiecki, Kuron, and all the people that you have 
almost no contacts with any more? 
  [Walesa] Certainly, I would like to be 18 or 20, but that is 
impossible; I would like to go back to the times when everything 
was simple: One was either for or against communism. But after 
our victory we did well to split, otherwise today there would be 
a Solidarity party, a Solidarity parliament, Solidarity laws. 
In practice we would have reconstructed a monopoly of power 
under another name. We would have ended up enjoying the taste 
of power. We would have ended up with an Italian model, with an 
elite looking after its own interests only, without any links 
with the grass roots, and in the end the grass-roots would have 
risen against us. 
  [Gawronski] What concerns you about your country? 
  [Walesa] Certainly not the communists. In all my life I have 
met only one real Communist, and that was not even in Warsaw 
among the authorities, but in Danzig at the Lenin shipyards, 
where a worker was such a Communist that they expelled him from 
the party. As for the rest, I have faith and hope. An 
intelligent Jew once said to me: "Don't worry when things are 
going badly, they can only get better." We find ourselves 
precisely in such a situation.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 4 -- Poland's search for membership of 
NATO is motivated by a wish to create a more stable security 
situation in Europe, and should not be interpreted as a threat 
to Russia, presidential press spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski said 
on Tuesday. 
  In an interview for the third programme of Polish Radio, 
Drzycimski noted that the former communist bloc was the main 
region where conflicts and wars are emerging. 
  Drzycimski also welcomed the statement on Monday from 
General 
John Shalikashvili, chief of the United States General Staff, 
that Russia will not be granted the right of veto over the 
eventual entry of central European states into the Atlantic 
alliance. Until now, it had seemed as though it was not NATO 
that would decide on accepting or rejecting new members, but 
Russia, Drzycimski said.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan 4 -- The 1994 draft budget law envisages 
more means for subsidies lowering interest on agricultural 
credits, intervention measures on the agricultural market and 
for the development of countryside infrastructure, Deputy 
Agriculture Minister Maria Zwolinska said Tuesday [4 January]. 
Under the draft budget, the amount allocated for subsidies to 
agricultural credits is to be increased by nearly 70 percent as 
compared with 1993. Cheap credits are to be granted to farmers 
for the purchase of fertilizers, pesticides, seeds and for other 
expenses facilitating the reconstruction of agricultural 
production. 
  The upgrading of farms and the food processing sector is to 
be supported by the agency for the restructuring and 
modernization of agriculture in line with a law adopted by the 
Sejm. Funds at the agency's disposal are to come from budget 
subsidies, interests on bank reserves and repayments of credits 
granted by the agency's predecessor -- the fund for agricultural 
restructuring and debt-rescheduling. Some 1.2 trillion zlotys 
(47 million USd) from a World Bank loan are to be earmarked for 
the development of countryside infrastructure.

  [Text] Gdansk, Jan. 4 -- The Presidium of the National 
Commission of the Solidarity trade union discussed in Gdansk 
today issues related to the implementation of the pact on state 
enterprises and the establishment of a tripartite commission 
representing employers, the government and trade unions. 
  Deputy Minister of Labour and Social Policy Andrzej 
Baczkowski, present at the meeting, expressed his hope at a 
press conference in Gdansk that the establishment of the 
commission would be possible in January. He also declared that 
by January 7 the government would take stands on all agreements 
concluded with Solidarity. 
  Baczkowski also said that the draft privatization law 
included in the enterprise pact is in the last stage of 
interministerial consultations. He added that the government 
would seek a consensus with trade unions about concrete 
legislative solutions and not the trade unions' opinion on the 
final version of the draft. Matters of argument could be 
presented to the Sejm along with the draft law, he said. 
  Solidarity Chairman Marian Krzaklewski termed the draft 
budget law as "conflict-prone" while not taking into account 
"dynamic methods of compensating for rises in costs of living" 
in view of planned rises in energy prices and rents. According 
to him, the rules of the so called social safety net should be 
clearly defined before the adoption of the budget law.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 4/1/1994 -- On the last but one 
day of 1993, former Colonel General Iulian Vlad, former chief of 
the State Security Department until 22 December 1989, when the 
Ceausescus were overthrown, was set free on probation, under the 
decision of a Bucharest district court. The decision of the 
court was explained by the fact that the over 60-year-old 
convict had already served one-third of his penalty. His health 
condition and the good conduct while he was in prison were two 
more reasons sustaining the decision. 
  Iulian Vlad, directly involved in the December 1989 events, 
was sued in court on 3 August 1990, through the bill of 
indictment of the Military Prosecutors' Department of Romania's 
Prosecutor's Office. The bill of indictment listed his 
participation in the meetings of the [Romanian Communist Party] 
Executive Political Committee of 17 and 22 December 1989, when 
"he agreed to the decision to use firearms against demonstrators 
in Timisoara and other localities in the country." 
  On 28 April 1992 the Supreme Court of Justice, ruling on the 
appeal filed by the Department of Military Prosecutor's Offices, 
decided to change the indictment from abetting genocide to 
instrumentality to aggravated attempted murder, sentencing 
Iulian Vlad to 12 years of prison, 6 years of banned rights, and 
military demotion. 
  Ex-General Vlad told daily EVENIMENTUL ZILEI on his release: 
"I think the Romanian justice has done is duty to the full, a 
fact that allows me now to return to the society with the 
feeling that I have expiated my sins."

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 5/1/1994 -- "The Social 
Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR], that assumed the 
responsibility of ruling the country in these difficult moments 
of crisis, is keen on reaffirming on this occasion as well that 
Romania's integration in the Euro-Atlantic structures is a 
fundamental objective of our foreign policy," reads a communique 
released in Bucharest on 5 January. "From this position, PDSR 
fully backs the official efforts Romania is making to become a 
member of the North Atlantic Alliance. PDSR salutes the 
initiative of Romania's President Ion Iliescu to address on 24 
December a letter to the heads of states or governments of the 
NATO member states, before the upcoming meeting of the alliance, 
reconfirming Romania's constant interest to become a full member 
of the NATO structures. 
  PDSR took note with satisfaction of the recent declarations 
of high officials in the U.S. Administration, according to whom 
"the Partnership for Peace" is for the budding democracies in 
Europe, Romania included, a first step in the process of their 
integration in the NATO structures and a guarantee of security 
at the same time. We are sure that under the conditions of the 
political developments in our proximity, NATO will be in a 
position to offer security guarantees to Romania, necessary for 
preserving its national being and ensuring conditions for 
carrying the democratic transformations the Romanian people has 
committed to since the December 1989 revolution. 
  On the eve of the Brussels meeting of the NATO countries, 
PDSR expresses hope that Romania's security interests will 
resonate with the leaders of the NATO member states, that no 
discriminatory practices will be accepted concerning the 
countries interested to enter the Euro-Atlantic structures. At 
the same time, we understand the concerns repeatedly expressed 
by the U.S. Administration and other NATO member countries for 
not isolating Russia and for taking into account its security 
interests, without prejudicing in this way Romania's security 
interests."

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 3/1/1994 -- The Romanian 
Government plans to withhold on a line of cautious fiscal, 
monetary, and budgetary policies in 1994 and 1995, says the 
letter of intent and the memorandum for the following two years 
agreed with the International Monetary Fund. The letter was 
forwarded by the prime minister [Nicolae Vacaroiu] to parliament 
for debate and approval. 
  The said policies will be implemented through a package of 
measures of structural reform including an accelerated 
privatization and restructuring of the enterprises, deep reforms 
of the fiscal and financial sector, and the establishing of a 
inter-bank currency market. 
  The memorandum of economic policy contains details of these 
policies aiming to achieve the economic goals of the government. 
The Romanian Government requests a 19-month stand-by agreement 
with the IMF to make available 131.95 million special drawing 
rights [SDR] plus two drawings totalling 377 SDR [figure as 
received], half of which within the structural transformation 
facility and following the approval of the memorandum, with the 
other half available by the date of the finalization of the 
first assessment by the IMF scheduled for 15 November 1994. The 
second assessment is scheduled for 15 May 1995. The first 
assessment is expected to outline the macro-economic, budgetary, 
and monetary objectives for 1995 and to reassess the estimations 
for external financing needs.

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 5 (CTK) -- Slovakia considers 
neither the Czechoslovak Airlines (CSA) issue nor the merchant 
navy issue to be settled, as far as the division of the property 
of the former Czechoslovak Ministry of Transport and 
Telecommunications is concerned, Slovak Minister of Transport 
and Telecommunications Roman Hofbauer said today. 
  He told CTK that through international arbitration Slovakia 
will try to achieve the abolition of the trade names 
Ceskoslovenske aerolinie (CSA), Ceskoslovenska namorni doprava 
(Czechoslovak Merchant Navy) and Ceskoslovenska autobusova 
doprava (Czechoslovak Bus Transport). 
  "The names of these organisations are connected with a 
non-existent state," said Hofbauer and added that the Czech side 
had been notified of Slovakia's intentions, but had not reacted 
to them. 
  The Slovak Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications last 
year managed to successfully ensure the devolution of all powers 
from the Federation to the new state, and supported the founding 
of many new institutions non-existent in Slovakia under the 
Federation, Hofbauer said at a press conference. 
  He described as very important Slovakia's joining of 20 
international organisations, 13 of them governmental and seven 
non-governmental. 
  According to Hofbauer, foreign financial institutions are 
interested in investments in transport and telecommunications in 
Slovakia. The World Bank is interested in modernising railroad 
transport, while the European Investment Bank is interested in 
modernising aviation and airports, he said.

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 5 (CTK) -- The disputed sections of 
the Czech-Slovak border are likely to be discussed by the two 
countries' interior ministers, Stanislav Becic, chairman of the 
Slovak delegation to the joint Czech-Slovak Border Commission 
tells today's issue of the left-orientated PRAVDA. 
  According to Becic, 63 percent or 270 kilometres, of the 
state border had been set by mid-December. Where the state 
border is formed by the Morava River, it runs along its middle, 
and the boundary stones are being placed on its banks. 
  On the issue of the 128 hectares Slovakia allegedly lost due 
to the regulation of the Morava River, Becic said that Slovakia 
had asked the Czech Republic to compensate for the territory at 
the Javornik settlement. "No settlement has been arrived at. 
No agreement has been reached regarding the Czech demands for 
the Kasarna weekend-house region and part of the Sidonia 
settlement either," Becic reports. 
  According to Becic, the Czech Republic considers the border 
sections Slovakia proposes to resolve to be disputable. By 
contrast, Slovakia believes there is no disputable section along 
the whole length of the border, since the state border should be 
in line with the current administrative border. 
  Becic says that if the documents from 1938 are compared, 15 
differences between the current administrative and the former 
borders have been found. 
  The commission has not arrived at an agreement in four cases 
(Sidonia, Kasarna and Vrbovce settlements, and the Morava River) 
and will not discuss them any more. "The proposals to resolve 
the situation will be dealt with by the ministers at their 
forthcoming meeting. If they, too, do not come to an agreement, 
the cases will be settled at the governmental level," Becic 
states.

  [Text] Bratislava Dec 31 (CTK) -- Slovak Foreign and 
Passport Police seized travel documents from Ivan Lexa, chairman 
of the Government Office, in connection with the accusation of 
defamation of the state and its representative, the pro-Meciar 
daily REPUBLIKA writes today. 
  Lexa is alleged to have cast doubt on the morals of the 
president and his professional capabilities in connection with 
his age. 
  According to the paper, Lexa considers it absurd that the 
Slovak criminal bodies deem his case to be so important that 
they made it impossible for him to travel abroad. He considers 
the unprecedented political trial to be comparable with those 
communist from the 1950's.

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 4 (CTK) -- A group of citizens from 
the southern Slovak town of Komarno are seeking to dismiss 
Komarno Mayor Isztvan Pasztor, a leader of the Hungarian 
minority in southern Slovakia, Slovak Radio reported today. 
According to the radio, local discontent with the mayor's 
approach to solving daily problems of the town was the reason. 
Petitions demanding the mayor's resignation have been put up by 
civic initiatives at many places in the town and a public rally 
was called for Wednesday [5 January] in the headquarters of the 
Slovak cultural organisation Matica Slovenska. 
  Pasztor as chairman of the Council of the Association of 
Towns and Villages of the Zitny Island, is an initiator of a 
meeting of deputies and mayors from southern Slovakia scheduled 
for January 8 in Komarno to demand the establishment of a 
"region with special status" in southern Slovakia populated by a 
large Hungarian minority. Matica Slovenska has sharply 
condemned the meeting.

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 4 (CTK) -- Chairman of the 
Egyutteles Hungarian minority movement in Slovakia, Miklos 
Duray, today confirmed that the Komarno meeting convened by the 
Hungarian parliamentary parties in spite of the reservations 
raised by the Slovak president, government and parliament is 
aimed at creating a "region with special legal status" in 
southern Slovakia. 
  Egyutteles respects the laws and the Constitution and does 
not seek the revision of the state borders with Hungary, Duray 
said, adding that his movement wants to strive to ensure rights 
for the Hungarian minority only as a legal part of the Slovak 
Republic. It is only by coincidence that the Komarno meeting 
will take place on the eve of U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
meeting with the presidents of the Visegrad countries in Prague, 
Duray said. 
  Egyutteles demands that the ethnic principle is taken into 
account while introducing the new territorial division of 
Slovakia, he said, adding that his party intended to propose 
that the Komarno meeting appeal to the Slovak parliament to 
ratify the European Parliament Charter of European Towns and 
Regions. The Slovak Republic has not yet joined this agreement.

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 3 (CTK) -- A meeting of Slovak 
nationalists in Surany and the planned gathering in Komarno 
signal that neither Slovaks nor the Hungarian minority are 
content in southern regions of Slovakia where Hungarians live, 
Democratic Left Party (SDL) Deputy Chairman Pavol Kanis told CTK 
today. 
  He said the view that the high-ranking officials of 
Slovakia's Hungarian parliamentary parties are some sort of 
"lone runners" without any background seems to be unsound, as 
current opinion polls indicate that the Egyutteles Hungarian 
minority movement and the Hungarian Christian Democratic 
Movement (MKDH) each represent 20 percent of the ethnic 
Hungarian population. 
  Kanis said the worst shortcoming lies in the conceptlessness 
of the Slovak Government and parliament in their approach to 
ethnic minority issues. He said this approach should be changed 
and these problems solved "comprehensively and definitively," 
since the failure to do so was constantly giving rise to new 
Hungarian demands. 
  He said the SDL had long pointed to the necessity of solving 
national minority problems with a constitutional law, but that 
this had not been done. That Hungarian representatives 
submitted such a bill to Parliament Chairman Ivan Gasparovic 
last summer and that this bill was "swept off the table," as 
they said, was unfortunate, Kanis said. 
  The problems of Hungarian and Slovak co-existence in 
southern 
Slovakia has become an international one, he said. That is why 
it should be seen with "European eyes." That the SDL was a 
representative of the forces which "want to reach a compromise" 
is proved by its exemplary relations with the Hungarian 
Socialist Party, Kanis said.

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 3 (CTK) -- The Alliance of Slovak 
Democrats (ADSR), at the forthcoming parliamentary session, will 
support a Christian Democratic Movement's (KDH) request for the 
resignation of Minister of Transport and Telecommunications 
Roman Hofbauer, ADSR Deputy Igor Gazdik told CTK today. 
  Gazdik said the reason for this was Hofbauer's bad 
performance, especially his callous approach to the removal of 
bilingual road signs for towns and villages in southern Slovakia 
and the termination by his ministry of an agreement with Radio 
Free Europe to broadcast in Slovakia. He said that opposition 
parties have discussed their course of action in connection with 
Hofbauer's dismissal as they did in the case of former Health 
Minister Viliam Sobona. 
  ADSR Deputy Chairman Rudolf Filkus told CTK that the broader 
government coalition which Slovak President Michal Kovac pleaded 
for in this New Year's address was a "precondition for the joint 
resolution of the decisive questions in Slovak society." 
  He said it was not just empty talk that foreign capital was 
waiting for unambiguous signals of political stabilisation in 
Slovakia, and that the stability of the government was a 
necessary step towards political stabilisation. 
  Filkus ruled out the possibility of forming a broader 
government coalition under the leadership of the current Slovak 
premier and chairman of the ruling Movement For a Democratic 
Slovakia, Vladimir Meciar. He said the results of the 1992 
parliamentary elections should be taken into consideration while 
forming a new multi-party coalition. He also said a member of 
the HZDS would be charged with forming a government in such an 
event, and that current Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik or 
Deputy Premier Roman Kovac would be the most appropriate 
candidates.

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 3 (CTK) -- The efforts by the 
opposition Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) to dismiss Slovak 
Minister of Transport and Communications Roman Hofbauer is only 
a "partial" solution, Slovak National Party (SNS) Chairman 
Ludovit Cernak told CTK today. 
  KDH Chairman Jan Carnogursky, in a statement given to CTK 
December 29, said his movement would propose Hofbauer's 
resignation at the next parliamentary session on the grounds of 
his bad performance which "culminated with the ministry's 
decision to terminate on January 31, 1994, an agreement with 
Radio Free Europe to broadcast its programme in Slovakia by 
means of this country's radio transmitters." 
  Cernak said he believed the current situation on the Slovak 
political scene needed a fundamental solution. He said he did 
not favour a method of trimming from the government, adding that 
Slovak President Michal Kovac indicated possible solutions to 
the current situation in Slovakia in his new year address. 
  The possibility of forming a broad coalition mentioned by 
Kovac corresponds to SNS policy, Cernak stressed, adding that 
also within the current coalition with the ruling Movement For a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) the SNS backs the idea of cooperation 
of several political entities. "We fully support the ideas of 
the president," he stressed. 
  The SNS Deputies' Club divided into two factions at the last 
parliamentary session -- a national democratic one led by Cernak 
and another one led by Deputy Premier Marian Andel which 
supports Slovak Premier and HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar. 
According to SNS parliamentary deputy Igor Chamula, Hofbauer's 
resignation has not yet been discussed by the SNS Deputies' 
Group.

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 5 (CTK) -- Last year Slovakia lost 
too much wasting time, and the talent and goodwill of its 
population, Igor Uhrik, deputy chairman of the Slovak National 
Party (SNS), told journalists today. 
  He said he considered 1993 to be a lost year because 
Slovakia 
lost its good initial position it had acquired after the 1992 
elections. All of this was caused by the HZDS's (ruling 
Movement For a Democratic Slovakia) refusal to share power and 
decision-making after it won the elections. At that time, it 
was possible to create a broad coalition called for by President 
Michal Kovac in his New Year's address, Uhrik said. 
  The fact that the HZDS (66 deputies in the 150-seat Slovak 
parliament) started to discuss coalition with the SNS (14 
deputies) only last summer is an evidence of the failed policy 
of the party which had been refusing to share power for a year, 
Uhrik stated. 
  The principles of cooperation between the two parties will 
have to be somewhat modified now. The SNS cannot play the role 
of a mere "tool in the electoral machinery" in the coalition, 
Uhrik concluded.

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 5 (CTK) -- Ludovit Cernak, chairman 
of the Slovak National Party (SNS), told journalists today that 
he considered it his most urgent task "to clear his own table, 
address the public frankly and show willingness to cooperate." 
  Cernak said that the SNS was the first party to propose the 
creation of the government of a broader coalition, and had 
adopted this idea as a part of its programme at the last year's 
conference in Ruzomberok, Central Slovakia. That is why he 
identified himself with the words of Slovak President Michal 
Kovac, who promoted the idea of broader coalition in his New 
Year's speech, he added. 
  Cernak said he regretted that the SNS leadership's control 
over the party has dwindled away, that party principles have 
ceased to be effective, and the party has taken a position in 
which it identified itself with its political partner the 
Movement For a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), the SNS' government 
coalition partner. 
  In the days to come, the SNS leadership and the Central 
Council will decide on the party's future attitude to the 
coalition questions, Cernak said. He did not rule out that even 
an SNS conference will be convoked as the party supreme body. 
  SNS representatives are to attend today's regular HZDS 
meeting. However, SNS Deputy Chairman Igor Uhrik said that SNS 
leaders had learnt this only from today's press. He said that 
as far as he knew, no SNS representative had been officially 
invited to the meeting. HZDS is obviously striving to push 
through a certain group of SNS deputies, whose philosophy is 
accommodated to the HZDS policy, Uhrik concluded.

  [Excerpts] Bratislava, Jan 4 (CTK) -- [passage omitted] 
"Do not let us be misled by the demand of an accommodating 
approach as we have no space for retreat," Deputy Chairman of 
the Slovak Parliament and a leader of the governing Movement for 
a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) Augustin Marian Huska reacts to the 
calls for change in Slovak Government in the pro-Meciar daily 
REPUBLIKA, published by the Slovak News Agency TA SR. 
  "Foreign hegemonic leaders and their domestic lackeys are 
spreading again reports on the danger of dictatorship, that the 
premier is not bearable for abroad and for the `sobered-up' 
society and that he is allegedly unbearable even for the 
Hungarian partners, that the situation demands a complaisant and 
servile `expert' government which would `listen' more to the 
great-Hungarian and Czechoslovakist advice," Huska says. "It 
contradicts the Czech interests because (the current Slovak 
Government) does not want to accept the forged balance of the 
Czechoslovak State Bank which made Slovakia a debtor instead of 
creditor. The attack on the inconvenient government is also a 
punishment for the fact that we dared to emancipate ourselves," 
he states. 
  According to Huska, "the great power vacuum awakened the 
egoistic ambitions of our southern neighbor. It is blindly 
striding towards the vision of at first a `mid-sized' and then a 
Great Hungary. Should we create because of these unruly 
interests a less resistant government?" 
  "The American senators and congressmen for the Democratic 
Party told us openly in early December that the only reasonable 
policy is not to comply with foreign hunger for territory, it is 
a radical, unyielding, transformation-minded government which 
defends the interests of the Slovak society. They told us that 
when up against foreign interests, the most successful and 
efficient are unyielding and incorruptible authorities," Huska 
claims. 
  "The stability of the Slovak Government system is the 
supreme 
priority of our freedom, it means more than anything else for 
us," Huska concludes.

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 3 (CTK) -- Oil from Ukraine is 
flowing into Slovakia on the Latorica River, and the Slovak 
Accident Commission estimates that the flow is expected to 
continue for about two more days, Stanislav Vikartovsky, manager 
of the Kralovsky Chlmec (East Slovakia) Civil Defense 
Department, told CTK. 
  The site of the accident is about eighty kilometers from the 
Slovak border, near the city of Mukachevo in Sub-Carpathian Rus, 
where a pipeline has ruptured. 
  Vikartovsky refuted media reports that the river is covered 
by a layer of oil 20-25 centimeters deep. These reports are 
exaggerated, he said. He reported that three underwater walls 
have been built in the river in Slovakia to catch the oil. 
However, some of the polluted water is flowing into Hungary. 
  He also said that Slovakia is trying to obtain more 
information on the extent of the spill near Mukachevo, but very 
little information from Ukraine has been received so far. 
  Because the river has overflowed its banks, samples of well 
water are being tested in surrounding communities. So far no 
oil contamination has been found in well water, Vikartovsky said. 
  Last October, the East Slovak Uh River and its surroundings 
were polluted by an oil spill on the Ukrainian side. To this 
day, wells in the area are contaminated with oil, and 
inhabitants must get water from other sources. However, Ukraine 
did not inform Slovak authorities at all. The situation is 
complicated by the lack of a Slovak-Ukrainian agreement on 
common rivers, as exists between Slovakia and Hungary.

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 4 (CTK) -- The conditions for 
partial German funding of the construction of the nuclear power 
plant in Mochovce, West Slovakia, are to be specified in 
January, Slovak Vice-Premier for Economy Sergej Kozlik announced 
today. Kozlik took part in negotiations today with the German 
ambassador to Slovakia, Heike Zenker, on the completion of 
construction work in Mochovce and its financing. The key 
issues, in his opinion, concern the repayment of German loans 
through supplies of nuclear energy to Germany and the closing of 
the nuclear power plant in Jaslovske Bohunice, West Slovakia, on 
which the realization of the project is conditional. Kozlik 
said that clear economic calculations are necessary if Slovakia 
is to prove she can be depended on to repay her loans. A total 
of 1.5 billion DEM [German marks] in foreign loans is to be 
provided for the construction of the nuclear power plant in 
Mochovce.

  [Text] Pristina, January 5 (ATA) -- Upon the initiative of 
a group of citizens in Presheva, signatures for a petition are 
being taken for the lifting of taxes in the border points in 
Presheva, between rump Yugoslavia and the former Republic of 
Macedonia. The application of taxes affects all citizens, 
especially Albanians, because the Albanians of Presheva have 
many family relations with the Albanians of Macedonia, who have 
unjustly been divided by artificial borders. Since the first of 
January 1994, the border authorities of rump Yugoslavia demand 
10 DM per person and 30 DM per vehicle before leaving them to 
pass the border.

  [Text] Tirana, January 6 (ATA) -- The spokesman of Tirana 
District Attorney's Office reports that the office had ordered 
December 31, 1993 the arrest of Veiz Haderi and Besim Veizaj, 
former heads of the branches of the interior of Saranda and 
Pogradec during 1988-1990 period. Contrary to their competences 
they had illegaly obeyed the orders of former ministers of the 
interior in regard to the rules of defending the border. 
Through their bad behaviours they have violated the personality 
of man and have mistreated different persons who have tried to 
cross the state borders and have walked the borders victims 
before crowds of people. 
  In the summer of 1990, although communist dictatorship had 
declared that border crossing was no longer considered treason, 
hundreds of young boys and girls who attempted to cross the 
border were killed. A total of 80-110 persons were killed 
during 1989-1990, according to experts. 
  The trial of Engjel Thoma, former commander of the border 
guards of Samrisht, Shkodra District was held on October 27, 
1993. Six young Albanians were killed in 8 months' time in 1990 
in the border center. Official figures on the murders of 
Albanians are expected to be higher. 
  Various reports published in the Albanian press over the 
last 
three years show that senior officials of former state security 
and former President Alia are responsible for these murders.

<F P=106> ["Power Industry Chief Shervashidze: `I Am a Nuclear </F>
Lobbyist'" -- BTA headline] 
  [Text] Sofia, January 5 (BTA) -- "If we do not start 
construction of a new power station within a couple of years, we 
will have to pay through the nose," Nikita Shervashidze, 
chairman of the Power Engineering Committee, says in an 
interview for the 24 CHASA daily. He adds that no power plant 
except the Chaira Pumped Storage Power Station has been under 
construction since 1990 and that in three to four years time the 
Maritsa Iztok 1 Thermoelectric Power Station and some other 
minor thermal power plants will be closed down. According to 
Mr. Shervashidze, a nuclear as well as some conventional types 
of generating facilities should be built in Bulgaria. At the 
same time, he believes that the current 40 percent proportion of 
nuclear power in electricity production is the optimum and 
should be maintained. According to Mr. Shervashidze, it would 
be more profitable to build an N-plant but this would take at 
least six years and the only feasible site is in Belene (where a 
new nuclear power plant went under construction back in the 
1980's and was put into cold storage in 1990 for lack of money 
and under environmentalists' pressure). 
  The chairman of the Power Engineering Committee denies press 
allegations of the existence of a "nuclear Mafia" in Bulgaria 
but says he himself belongs to a nuclear power lobby campaigning 
to convince the government and people in this country of the 
excellent prospects and the economic efficiency of nuclear 
energy in Bulgaria. 
  Further in his interview, Mr. Shervashidze says there are 
several projects for completion the second nuclear power plant 
in Belene (on the Danube). According to him, the site in Belene 
can accommodate six nuclear reactors of 1,000 megawatts each. 
The draft project envisaged two nuclear reactors of 1,000 
megawatts each, but later it became clear that 500-100 [as 
received] megawatt units suited better Bulgaria's energy supply 
system and their construction was feasible. 
  Nikita Shervashidze believes the motion by 14 MP's for a 
moratorium on the development of nuclear power engineering and 
the construction of nuclear facilities can not be serious. "A 
plant for recycling cool radioactive waste is being built and if 
such a moratorium is imposed, the construction will have to be 
stopped," Mr. Shervashidze says. 
  He points out that the construction of gas-powered stations, 
worth about $1,100-1,200 per kilowatt of installed capacity, is 
also possible in Bulgaria, but the high prices of imported gas 
raise the cost of such projects.

  [Text] Sofia, January 4 (BTA) -- Mr. Rumen Avramov, deputy 
chairman of the Agency for Economic Coordination and 
Development, an independent institution making annual and 
monthly analyses of the state of Bulgaria's economy, has 
predicted several price shocks in Bulgaria in 1994. He deems 
them imminent because they will release the piled-up but 
deferred inflationary potential in the fixed prices of electric 
power and fuels. Mr. Avramov does not expect hyperinflation. 
"I am hopeful the main levers of the economic policy will not 
defeat each other as was the case in 1993," he says. 
  In an interview in today's DUMA, Mr. Avramov attaches 
particular importance to income indexing. "Automatic indexing 
was the main culprit for tying the cabinet's hands in the field 
of budgetary policies and for the high deficit," he comments. 
  Mr. Avramov thinks possible outside funding will be of prime 
importance throughout the year as the country was placed in 
total economic isolation. He also points to other important 
events, like the entry into force in April of the VAT 
[value-added tax] Act, which is expected to entail a single 
price rise and will restructure the tax base of the budget. 
  Asked whether the monetarist model will have to be 
corrected, 
Mr. Avramov says the Bulgarian model is not a monetarist one 
"either as an ideology or least as real policies." "State-run 
enterprises are still functioning without fixed budget 
restrictions, though a great number of them have practically 
gone bankrupt," the deputy chairman of the Agency for Economic 
Coordination and Development explains.

  [Text] Sofia, January 5 (BTA) -- Significant structural 
transformations in banking will take place in 1994, while the 
National Bank of Bulgaria (BNB) will play a very important, even 
decisive role in the attainment of a crucial agreement: the new 
third standby arrangement with the International Monetary Fund, 
BNB Governor Prof. Todor Vulchev says in an interview in 
OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK. He adds that a comprehensive bank 
privatization strategy is yet to be worked out, but the bank's 
Governing Board has the ambition to consider a draft of a 
privatization programme by mid-January, coordinate it with the 
Bank Consolidation Company and jointly submit it to the 
government. Todor Vulchev thinks two or three major state-run 
banks may be privatized this year. Bank privatization will get 
under way and we want this to be done by mid-1994, the BNB 
governor states. Prof. Vulchev holds the hidden privatization, 
much talked about last year, was actually a succession of 
relatively small and insignificant offenses. The emergence of 
15 private banks is an asset, the BNB governor thinks. 
  On parliament's decision for the BNB to provide $300 million 
in backup to the deal on Bulgaria's debt to private creditors, 
Prof. Vulchev says the money is available. These are Bulgaria's 
foreign exchange assets in various foreign banks. "We can 
declare any time that the 300 million of our assets worth $750 
million have been allocated to the debt deal and no one is 
authorized to touch them. This does not mean, however, that we 
cannot operate with them painlessly," the BNB governor says in 
conclusion.

  [Text] Sofia, January 5 (BTA) -- The Confederation of 
Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria (KNSB) must be a priority 
concern for the National Council of Tripartite Cooperation, the 
confederation's Vice President Ivan Neykov told a news 
conference here today. KNSB, which is one of the two most 
influential labour amalgamations in the country, will probably 
come up with an official proposal on incomes policy countering 
the proposal of government experts, Mr. Neykov said. 
  After three months of work in the Tripartite Council's 
subcommittees, three fundamental differences still remain 
between the proposals of the government and the KNSB, the 
confederation's Executive Secretary Mr. Georgi Georgiev told the 
news conference. The KNSB rejects the cabinet-proposed method of 
adopting projected inflation as a key element in the overall 
incomes policy. The amalgamation's experts claim that the 45 
percent average annual inflation, projected for 1994, will be 
exceeded already at the start of the year. 
  The KNSB also sees as unacceptable the government-suggested 
options for cost-of-living adjustment of pensions. The 
mechanism which is proposed now could make it impossible to 
abolish adjustment supplements in future, Mr. Georgiev said. 
Another option suggests merely a revision of the base of 
pension calculation and a one-time rise without adjustment 
payments throughout the year. The KNSB believes this will lead 
to an economically and socially unjustified increase of the 
difference between the lowest and the highest pensions. The 
confederation will suggest an option which will retain the 
inflation-related indexation of pensions. This will create 
conditions for a complete abolition of cost-of-living adjustment 
supplements to pensions in 1995, Mr. Georgiev said. 
  The KNSB does not accept a method suggested by the Finance 
Ministry for wage formation and wage growth regulation in the 
state-financed sector. The amalgamation insists on guarantees 
of the availability of money for the payment of agreed wages in 
the state-financed sector irrespective of budget revenue, Mr. 
Georgiev said.

  [Text] Prague Jan 5 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic accepts 
U.S. President Bill Clinton's Partnership for Peace initiative 
aimed at gradually increasing cooperation between NATO and 
Eastern Europe, Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus told journalists 
today. Partnership for Peace offers Central and Eastern 
European countries closer military cooperation with NATO and 
envisages that they agree to gradual expanding of their 
cooperation with NATO and not insist on immediate admittance to 
the Alliance. 
  Klaus said these countries should bear in mind that for the 
United States and other NATO member states, Russia is a power 
which should be taken into consideration. Klaus was reacting to 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's statement today in which he 
warned NATO of a possible negative reaction by the Russian 
public to NATO's probable expansion eastward. Yeltsin described 
the arguments of countries seeking membership in NATO as 
"unconvincing." 
  Klaus said he knew that "Russia considered this issue to be 
a 
sensitive one," but added that the question was not urgent 
because "nobody is offering us membership in NATO." 
  Klaus said that from the first moment when it become known 
that on his way from Brussels to Moscow Clinton will stop in 
Prague and meet representatives of the Visegrad countries -- the 
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland -- it was clear 
that the talks would be separate. Speculations that the Czech 
Republic was preventing or not preventing coordinated talks to 
be held are superfluous, he added. 
  Klaus was thus reacting to reports which appeared in the 
Czech and foreign media that the Czechs do not support the idea 
of joint talks between high-ranking Visegrad officials and 
Clinton during his January 11-12 visit to Prague. 
  At its meeting today, the Czech Government approved the 
programme of Clinton's stay in Prague. The U.S. delegation will 
meet for bilateral talks with delegations of the four Visegrad 
countries. Bilateral talks between Klaus and the Polish, Slovak 
and Hungarian premiers will take place in Hrzansky Palac. 
  After Clinton's departure from Prague on January 12, Czech 
President Vaclav Havel, Klaus and Czech Foreign Minister Josef 
Zieleniec will give separate dinners for their Visegrad 
colleagues, Klaus said.

  [Text] Prague Jan 4 (CTK) -- Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus 
does not view state administration reform through the eyes of a 
financier, he said on Czech Radio today. "It is the last 
viewpoint I am taking into consideration at the moment," he 
added. 
  Klaus said, however, that such an approach could prove to be 
no good as "every such interference costs something." "I have 
an impression that I should play a role of a financier at the 
moment and start counting how much it will cost," Klaus said. 
He added, however, that the idea of state administration reform 
demanded "deeper discussion." 
  The supposition that "all things should always be done 
closer 
to citizens, is only half correct," Klaus said. "It is 
certainly not true that we should conduct foreign policy closer 
to the people and solve the basic problems of the army and this 
country's defence closer to the people," Klaus said. 
  He said he firmly believed the government would manage to 
resolve "the deepest conceptual questions" connected with the 
reform during January and would meet the timetable set for state 
administration reform. That means that draft proposal for 
competitions to be invested into higher self-governing units 
would be completed, he said. 
  Speaking about the role of the state in society, Klaus said 
this role should be "extremely small." He added, however, that 
as a representative of the state he could not consider the state 
its major enemy but should on the contrary try to do his utmost 
for the state to function well and bring "something positive to 
the people." 
  Klaus said that the opportunities for businessmen in the 
Czech Republic to make a profit without offering the right 
quality of their goods or services were diminishing and this 
process was irreversible. He said ethics and morality on one 
side and a market economy on the other do not exclude each other 
but are interconnected. "Any attempts to separate these things 
are bad... because they are the two sides of one coin," Klaus 
said.

  She added that in a speech today, Finance Minister Ivan

budget surplus, and the Czech Republic is the only country 
undergoing transformation that has a surplus. The surplus, he 
said, is a sign of successful economic transformation, 
especially as the new tax system was instituted and enforced 
with no loans from the state.

crowns attributed in part to the fact that the state received 
about three billion crowns more than anticipated. 
  Klaus considers the high state revenue of about 357 billion 
crowns "an extraordinary success," especially since 1993 was the 
country's first year of existence, and during the year radical 
tax reforms were instituted. 
  He cautioned that the data are not yet definitive because 
until January 15 the state can receive bills for 1993, but only 
for relatively small sums. He added that the gross national 
product (GNP) growth for 1993 was about zero percent. 
  Klaus stated that the funds from the budget surplus would 
not 
be used for advances on reparations for Czech victims of the 
Nazis, as proposed by Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec. That 
proposal has not yet been submitted for "serious" discussion, 
Klaus said.

  [Text] Prague Jan 5 (CTK) -- The Czech Government today 
granted almost 20 million crowns (680,000 USD) to support 
minority newspapers and magazines, a government spokesman 
announced. A similar grant in 1993 amounted to 18.5 million 
crowns. 
  The Polish, Ukrainian, German, Hungarian, Romany and Slovak 
minority press will benefit from the grant, Premier Vaclav Klaus 
said. The government also approved setting up 150 individual 
grants, to be created by 1996, for third world students wishing 
to take up university-level study, the government spokesman said.

  [Text] Prague Jan 3 (CTK) -- A third editor of the weekly 
newspaper NECENZUROVANE NOVINY (Uncensored News) has brought 
suit against President Vaclav Havel in a Prague court, this time 
for defamation of character. 
  In his accusation, Editor Vladimir Pavlik claimed that Havel 
defamed him while testifying in court December 14 during his 
trial against two other editors, Petr Cibulka and Lubomir Vydra, 
who had charged Havel with making slanderous remarks against the 
newspaper. During his testimony, Havel called NECENZUROVANE 
NOVINY a "sewer spreading lies and hatred" and a "disgrace to 
our independent press." 
  Pavlik said that "since I publish regularly in the newspaper 
at issue and my name is listed in the staff box, it follows from 
my opponent's statements that my articles are spreading lies and 
hatred." 
  In consequence, he has suggested that the court order Havel 
to publish in all newspapers which published his original 
statements the following text: "The articles by Vladimir Pavlik 
in NECENZUROVANE NOVINY do not spread lies and hatred, and are 
not a disgrace to our independent press. The texts of these 
articles proves that if I were a moral and upstanding citizen, 
by virtue of my position as president I could have done much in 
the service of truth and democracy. That I have not testifies 
not only to my cowardice and positive relations to the 
perpetrators of communist-StB [State Security] crimes, but to 
the fact that for many years as a self-styled intellectual I had 
no possibility for self-realization."

  [Text] Prague Jan 4 (CTK) -- If Europe is capable of 
coping with the problems of laundering dirty money, crime, tax 
evasions and others, "we will cope with them as well," Czech 
Economics Minister Karel Dyba says in the latest issue of the 
Czech weekly MLADY SVET. He does not dismiss the information 
that the amount of dirty money -- originating from tax and 
customs evasions, sales of smuggled goods and drugs -- reaches 
some 25 million USD [U.S. Dollars] on Czech territory. "25 
million USD seems to be a big amount, but it is negligible in 
percentage," Dyba states. He explains that it makes up some 0.1 
percent of the total of 600 billion crowns (about 20 billion 
USD) annually loaned by the banking sector to the economy. "Of 
course... it is necessary to strive to eliminate the existence 
of any dirty money. But not at any cost, as we must not 
discourage the `pure' money, which might flow out from our 
banks," Dyba stresses. 
  Asked what the real problems of the Czech economy in 1993 
were, Dyba says that "from the point of view of healthy economic 
growth," he considers "emerging new internal relations within 
enterprises one of the problems." Others are the slow pace of 
courts' giving rulings, excessive bureaucracy, and others, he 
adds. Dyba states that "social consensus still exists in our 
country." He defines it as an agreement by most people with the 
reform, with the fast tempo set by the state. 
  "I think that this government not only speaks about a market 
economy without social attributes for instance, but it also 
promotes it in practice," Dyba emphasises. But on the other 
hand, the government cares for changes such as further 
liberalisation of prices to be scheduled evenly and for 
compensation for them to be paid "to certain layers of society, 
which objectively, in the present phase of economic development, 
need it,... to people who are objectively handicapped in some 
way," Dyba says. "Although the Czech Republic is carrying out 
massive changes, which took Western Europe a decade to be 
realised, within a far shorter time, most people accept this," 
Dyba states. He praises the people who "have realised that 
nobody would do anything for them, that the world is opened up 
for them, that they have a chance, but that they have to strive 
hard if they want to be successful. This is of key importance," 
Dyba stresses. 
  Asked what he thinks about the country's prospects for 1994, 
he says that he expects the price rises to be the lowest of all 
reform years (since 1990), and not to surpass 10 percent. Dyba 
says that if he were an independent economist, he would make his 
own estimate of economic growth in 1994, but being a politician, 
he sticks to the government prediction of a 2 to 3 percent 
growth in the gross domestic product. He stresses that growth 
depends on many circumstances, including improvement of the 
competitiveness of the Czech economy. "We do not expect any 
essential changes such as the introduction of a new taxation 
system and the split of the republic... this is favourable for 
the economic growth," Dyba says. 
  "Unemployment will slightly rise but not dramatically," he 
states, adding that he expects this to "be positive in a certain 
sense, mainly with regard to better labour discipline which 
usually accompanies the increase in unemployment." Dyba says he 
is not one of those considering bankruptcies an essential 
question and insisting that no key change can be made without 
enterprises going bankrupt. "Bankruptcies will simply come and 
I hope that they will be in proportion to the general economic 
development. I would particularly like the dynamic sector of 
small- and medium-sized businesses to develop, and a number of 
big enterprises to be reshaped," Dyba says. 
  Asked what the results of the next parliamentary elections 
slated for 1996 he expects, Dyba says he believes that the 
latest 1992 election winner, the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), 
of which he is a member, will be successful again. It will 
require hard work which would result in everybody benefiting 
from good economic developments," he concludes in MLADY SVET.

  [Text] Prague Jan 4 (CTK) -- Overall returns from small 
privatisation, which was completed on December 31, 1993, reached 
35.1 billion crowns (over one billion USD) [U.S. Dollars], 
National Property Fund Chairman Tomas Jezek says in today's 
issue of the daily CESKY DENIK. A total of 3.9 billion crowns 
of that have thus far been spent. Administrative costs such as, 
for example, those for privatisation commissions, were 240 
million crowns, while 450 million crowns was spent on 
depreciated property returned to its original owners. 
  Settlement of liquidation consequences of state-owned 
companies have thus far demanded close to 2 billion crowns. 
Town councils obtained a one-time payment of 1.2 billion crowns 
as compensation for enterprises which represented income for 
local budgets and were privatised or restituted. The net 
balance from the process is 31.2 billion crowns, of which 20 
billion has been deposited long-term, the interest of which is 
to be used in the privatisation of health care, Jezek concluded.

  [Text] Prague Jan 4 (CTK) -- Losses in Czech agriculture 
in 1993 can be roughly estimated at between 8.1 and 8.3 billion 
crowns (about 275,000 USD), the daily HOSPODARSKE NOVINY writes 
today. The data, obtained from the director of the Research 
Institute for Agricultural Economics, Josef Kraus, resulted from 
the institute's analysis and are preliminary. 
  Of the loss, 4.14 billion crowns was generated by state 
farms 
and 2.24 billion crowns by agricultural cooperatives. Private 
farmers showed the best results: They showed a profit when 
compensation for the work of the farmer and family members are 
not included. 
  Businesses involved in agricultural primary production saw a 
loss of 384 million crowns, while other agricultural companies, 
such as school farms, ended up with 1.2 to 1.4 billion crowns in 
aggregate losses. 
  Debts owed by the farms worsen the situation. They total 
42.2 billion crowns, more than twice the amount of claims -- 
19.7 billion crowns.

  [Text] Budapest, 5 January (MTI) -- Hungarian Minister of 
Defence Lajos Fur, in an interview in the breakfast television 
program "Napkelte" (Sunrise), said he is unable to fulfil the 
request of the opposition, namely to refrain from implementing 
changes in the army leadership until the elections. Fur said 
there is a valid measure which he wishes to observe, whereby 
soldiers reaching the age of 55 should be pensioned off. This 
rule will affect three or four generals until by the time of the 
elections. 
  The minister did not mention names, however, Colonel-General 
Kalman Lorincz, commander of the Hungarian Army, will turn 55 in 
February, 1994. A decision on relieving him will be made by the 
president of the republic, on proposal by the minister of 
defence, as is set down in the Defence Law which came into force 
on January 1. The new Defence Law also sets down that one 
person can fulfil the positions of commander and chief of staff. 
Observers believe that Lieutenant-General Janos Deak, the 
current chief of staff of the Hungarian Army, would fulfil these 
two functions in the future.

  [Text] Budapest, 31 December (MTI) -- Hungarian defense 
spending has dropped by almost half in real terms since 1989, 
with its share in the gross domestic product [GDP] down from 2.5 
percent to 1.88 percent, a recent publication entitled HONVEDSEG 
'93 (Home Defence '93) reveals. The Hungarian Army consists of 
exactly 100,000 people at the end of 1993. Of these, 13,700 are 
officers, 8,500 other ranks, 52,340 private soldiers, and 25,660 
civil employees. Three years ago the number of people employed 
by the defense forces totalled 143,200. The Army currently has 
1,229 tanks, 1,296 armored vehicles, 1,023 pieces of artillery, 
171 fighters, and 39 attack helicopters. (The air defense units 
come under Army control in Hungary.) 
  Tanks numbers have been reduced by over 100 in the year, 
with 
armored vehicles numbers down by more than 400. Currently only 
the number of tanks exceeds the limit fixed at 835 by 
international agreements. As the defense budget has been 
decreasing in real terms for several years, there is an ever 
tighter rein on money for development, which represented 19 
percent of all spending in 1990, but a mere 7.6 percent this 
year. The defense forces consider 30-40 percent budgeted for 
development would be ideal.

  [Text] Budapest, 5 January (MTI) -- Compared to the record 
high in March, 1993, the number of unemployed declined by 
50,000, to 630,000 at the end of the year. According to the 
short-term forecast of the National Labor Center, the decline 
will continue in the first half of 1994, and the number of 
people out of work will stand at around 580,000. 
  Statistics indicate that the value of Hungarian industrial 
production rose by 4 percent in 1993. The number of unemployed 
declined from 680,000 in March (a rate of 13 percent), to 
630,000 (12.2 percent). 
  This, however, is not the total number of unemployed. Last 
year, the National Labor Center carried out a national survey on 
those left out of the registers because their unemployment aid 
is no longer granted (as they had been out of work for one 
year). The result was that 12 percent of the long-term 
unemployed were left out of the register without any financial 
aid. The forecast of the institution for the first six months 
of 1994 reckons with only 20,000 people who stand to lose their 
eligibility, which means that roughly 50,000 people will not be 
on the unemployment records, but will be out of work in the 
summer of 1994. 
  The short-term forecast covered 4,600 firms that employed 
about one-third of workers (1.7 million people) and predicts a 
decline of 50,000 in the number of registered unemployed to 
580,000, that is 11.4 percent of the population in the working 
age group. 
  The analyses stresses that company manpower strategies have 
changed considerably in view of the boom taking shape in 
economy. The proportion of companies dismissing workers has 
steadily declined since the second half of 1992, and, in the 
second half of 1993, the number of economic units dismissing 
workers was less than those offering vacancies. 
  Company investment inclination also shows a steady rise, 
with 
18 percent of firms expanding capacities in the second half of 
1993. This proportion was significantly higher in industry, 
building industry, and servicing industry. The number of firms 
reporting growing orders is also on the rise. In the last 
quarter of 1993, the proportion of firms in a good or improving 
situation outnumbered that of firms in a lastingly poor or 
deteriorating situation, for the first time in two and a half 
years. 
  Demand will mainly increase for skilled workers, and more 
and 
more companies intend to employ first-time job seekers, which 
will improve the employment opportunities of this age-group (the 
rate of unemployment in the 16 to 25 age-group is 17 percent). 
  Figures indicate the boom also has beneficial effects on the 
territorial differences in unemployment, with employment 
opportunities showing the fastest rise in counties with the 
highest unemployment rates. 
  The analysis reckons with a further improvement in economic 
performance and, therefore, better employment opportunities as 
dismissals related to restructuring in industry, building 
industry and services is drawing to an end, after three years. 
However, in spite of the improving economic situation, the 
future of long-term unemployed persons unable to find work due 
to lack of qualifications or for health reasons, is still to be 
settled, experts note.

  [Text] Budapest, January 5 (MTI) -- The opposition 
Alliance of Free Democrats (AFD) regrets that Hungary's 
electoral law has been amended without settling the matter of 
parliamentary representation for minorities, Parliament Human 
Rights Committee Deputy Chairman Istvan Laszlo Meszaros of the 
AFD announced to the press today. 
  The AFD holds the government responsible for the failure and 
states that the bill, which required a two-thirds majority of 
votes, was improperly prepared. The AFD says the government 
ignored all suggestions from the liberal party. 
  According to the AFD, the government's original proposal 
would not have made it possible for all minorities to have 
parliamentary representation. Adopting it would have put 
minorities of smaller numbers into a detrimental position. 
Larger minorities would receive representation almost 
automatically, which would jeopardize the existence of the 
unicameral parliament. Furthermore, the "one minority -- one 
list" proposal ignored differences of political views within 
minorities. 
  According to the AFD's proposal, representatives of 
minorities would get a seat in Parliament by winning half of the 
votes usually necessary for an MP. Also, the proposal would 
give minorities outside of Parliament a right of consultation in 
Parliament's human rights committee. 
  The AFD seeks to launch coordination talks on minority 
parliamentary representation with the participation of the 
minority roundtable and parliamentary parties.

<F P=106> [Interview with Polish President Lech Walesa by Jas </F>
Gawronksi in Warsaw; date not given: "The President: `If the 
West Abdicates From its Role, the Former Soviet Bloc Will 
Reorganize Itself'"] 
  [Text] Warsaw -- When he was elected head of the Polish 
State, Lech Walesa restored an ancient chapel in the underground 
of the Belweder presidential palace that had formely been used 
by his communist predecessors, including General Jaruzelski, as 
a projection room. Where there was once a screen, there is now 
an altar in front of which Walesa kneels each morning at 7:30 
for Mass and Holy Communion. Then he goes back up the dark 
marble staircase covered by a fake Persian carpet leading 
directly to his office and to Poland's difficult problems. 
Today these problems consist primarily in the success of the 
right-wing nationalist extremists in the Russian elections. 
This election result has created real concern among the former 
communist countries of Europe, anxious to receive formal 
protection from NATO against Russia's new expansionism. To date 
Clinton has only offered the former satellite countries and 
Balkan states a vague "peace alliance" plan that does not 
satisfy their safety requirements when faced with the 
developments in Moscow. On the other hand, many people in 
Washington maintain that extending firm guarantees to these 
countries could mean destabilizing Yeltsin at this difficult 
time and strengthening the nationalistic tendencies, or else 
they are simply contrary to expanding U.S. commitment in Europe. 
All these problems will be discussed and decided upon in 
Brussels at a 10 January NATO meeting that is acquiring 
considerable importance for the future of the former communist 
Europe. Lech Walesa is convinced that the future of his country 
is being decided upon to some extent. 
  [Gawronksi] Mr. President, do the election results in Russia 
worry you? 
  [Walesa] Yes, but what worries me primarily is the inertia 
of 
Europe, its lack of insight, its imperviousnesss to the 
warnings, to the threats, that were and are more and more in the 
air. For some time I have been saying that it is in your 
interests, not ours, to expand the European Community, and that 
NATO should be expanded toward the East. Let me explain: There 
were two opposing blocs, one was the Soviet Union, which has 
been temporarily dissolved, and the other, the West, which is 
not getting bigger. What remains is a vacuum and politics does 
not tolerate vacuums. If Europe and NATO were to decide to 
gradually expand toward the former communist countries in Europe 
in the short term, six months at the most, then the field of 
confrontation would become smaller. Otherwise, we are back to 
square one: Russia will take the initiative, it will exert 
economic pressure upon us and other countries that are more 
important than Poland, such as Ukraine; we will have to give in 
to compromises, and the former Soviet bloc will be reformed, 
even if it is no longer a Soviet bloc, and this will lead to 
confrontation again. Russia already has unreliable politicians 
who are attempting to bribe NATO and the rest of the world! Now 
my question is: Why did we dissolve the Soviet Union, Comecon 
[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance], the Warsaw Pact. To 
remain alone and abandoned on a desert island? So, if Europe 
does not wake up, we will be back to square one in five or six 
years' time and this frightens me; because I don't know if 
there will be another person capable of creating a new 
Solidarity to set things right again. 
  [Gawronski] What should Europe do? 
  [Walesa] Follow the example of Clinton, who opened up to 
Mexico with the NAFTA accord regardless of the country's level 
of development: He realized it was in his interest to do so. 
And it is in Europe's interests to extend itself toward the 
East, encourage reforms, and invest. I have a theory: The cost 
of reforms is in proportion to the distance of those that are 
inspire them [sentence as published]. So you must start with 
Poland and the other East European countries and then go on to 
Russia and the countries of the former Soviet Union. We in 
Warsaw are giving a warning cry. We find ourselves in a 1939 
situation: People thought that the Germans wanted only Danzig, 
but they changed their minds when the Germans reached Paris. 
  [Gawronski] You were alluding to Poland's entry into NATO. 
But one of the problems is opposition by Russia. When Yeltsin 
was in Warsaw some months ago, he seemed to agree, you succeeded 
in persuading him, but when he returned to Moscow, he changed 
his mind. Why? 
  [Walesa] He was certainly influenced by his military, but I 
am sure he would not have changed his mind if the West had not 
been so lazy and inactive. In my meeting with Yeltsin I threw a 
ball into the West's court. When Yeltsin saw that the West 
failed to pick it up, that it did not want to play ball, that it 
was not interested in expanding toward the East, why should he 
have committed himself? Therefore I believe the West is to 
blame, not Yeltsin. 
  [Gawronski] But this bloc you forecast would be rather 
heterogeneous given the recent elections: Over to the far right 
in Russia, and with the former communists in power in Poland. 
  [Walesa] You people in the West judge everything according 
to 
your views and forget that we have not had political parties or 
democratic pluralism for 50 years. The former communists won in 
Poland not because they were communists but because they were 
more active and more well-prepared, more accustomed to managing 
power, than the others. They are ready to change their 
membership card from red to green, and then to blue and yellow 
and. The real question is: Will they be capable of 
accomplishing what they have promised? I doubt so, and I think 
that the parties that identify primarily with the principles 
that were once those of Solidarity will have the time to prepare 
themselves, acquire experience, and then chase out the 
post-communists in the next elections. 
  [Gawronski] So, though you are worried about the results of 
the Russian elections, one could say that you are not concerned 
about the Polish ones? 
  [Walesa] Look, I think this is be an unavoidable experience 
and it is better to experience it now than in 10 years' time. I 
repeat, those who won are better prepared. They were the only 
ones who could be better prepared, because they held the 
monopoly of power in the past and presented themselves united. 
They moved in a single bloc while the others argued. I would 
have preferred to deal with others, but I think that neither 
myself, nor my children will ever see the communists in power in 
Poland. For the time being we must use them for what they are, 
to reach our objectives, reconstruction, reforms, while keeping 
them under control, naturally, to make sure that they do not 
invert their course and to be sure that they respect pluralism, 
liberty, and democracy. Before, communism was inevitable, now it 
can be used even for our purposes. 
  [Gawronski] And what about those who have been defeated, 
including yourself, how have they reacted to the victory of the 
former communists? 
  [Walesa] Now one can see that I was right when I said not to 
come down too heavily on the communists, not to dig up their 
past, because they would only take their revenge later. I 
opposed putting the left under too much pressure. Instead I 
helped it, to prevent it doing the same thing again if the 
opportunity arose. 
  [Gawronski] The pope, who has always been a reference point 
for you, has said that there is a basis of truth in communism. 
  [Walesa] Much can be said about the past, but one must 
recognize the fact that they were times of greater social 
equilibrium, without such bitter differences in the standard of 
living. Today there are people who are nostalgic for this past. 
But we must not be: We must decide. The change will be slow 
and difficult, but there is no going back. 
  [Gawronski] What political system would you like for your 
country? 
  [Walesa] I do not like capitalism but nothing better has 
been invented yet. I would like a humane capitalism, that takes 
account of the poor, the sick, the destitute, but that also lets 
the rich live in peace. 
  [Gawronski] Let us talk about yourself a little. The 
popularity polls are not very good. Are you worried? 
  [Walesa] I am certainly no Miss Poland and neither am I the 
primate of Poland, who has no political responsibility, which is 
why, among other things, he no longer appeals to the people. 
But I think that nobody has done for this country more than I 
have done. I am working for Poland and nobody can accuse me of 
having made mistakes. As for the polls, they are biased and are 
not important. 
  [Gawronski] Now you are a little alone here in Belweder 
palace. Do you ever finding yourself thinking with nostalgia 
about the times of Solidarity, your old friends Michnik, 
Geremek, Mazowiecki, Kuron, and all the people that you have 
almost no contacts with any more? 
  [Walesa] Certainly, I would like to be 18 or 20, but that is 
impossible; I would like to go back to the times when everything 
was simple: One was either for or against communism. But after 
our victory we did well to split, otherwise today there would be 
a Solidarity party, a Solidarity parliament, Solidarity laws. 
In practice we would have reconstructed a monopoly of power 
under another name. We would have ended up enjoying the taste 
of power. We would have ended up with an Italian model, with an 
elite looking after its own interests only, without any links 
with the grass roots, and in the end the grass-roots would have 
risen against us. 
  [Gawronski] What concerns you about your country? 
  [Walesa] Certainly not the communists. In all my life I have 
met only one real Communist, and that was not even in Warsaw 
among the authorities, but in Danzig at the Lenin shipyards, 
where a worker was such a Communist that they expelled him from 
the party. As for the rest, I have faith and hope. An 
intelligent Jew once said to me: "Don't worry when things are 
going badly, they can only get better." We find ourselves 
precisely in such a situation.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 4 -- Poland's search for membership of 
NATO is motivated by a wish to create a more stable security 
situation in Europe, and should not be interpreted as a threat 
to Russia, presidential press spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski said 
on Tuesday. 
  In an interview for the third programme of Polish Radio, 
Drzycimski noted that the former communist bloc was the main 
region where conflicts and wars are emerging. 
  Drzycimski also welcomed the statement on Monday from 
General 
John Shalikashvili, chief of the United States General Staff, 
that Russia will not be granted the right of veto over the 
eventual entry of central European states into the Atlantic 
alliance. Until now, it had seemed as though it was not NATO 
that would decide on accepting or rejecting new members, but 
Russia, Drzycimski said.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan 4 -- The 1994 draft budget law envisages 
more means for subsidies lowering interest on agricultural 
credits, intervention measures on the agricultural market and 
for the development of countryside infrastructure, Deputy 
Agriculture Minister Maria Zwolinska said Tuesday [4 January]. 
Under the draft budget, the amount allocated for subsidies to 
agricultural credits is to be increased by nearly 70 percent as 
compared with 1993. Cheap credits are to be granted to farmers 
for the purchase of fertilizers, pesticides, seeds and for other 
expenses facilitating the reconstruction of agricultural 
production. 
  The upgrading of farms and the food processing sector is to 
be supported by the agency for the restructuring and 
modernization of agriculture in line with a law adopted by the 
Sejm. Funds at the agency's disposal are to come from budget 
subsidies, interests on bank reserves and repayments of credits 
granted by the agency's predecessor -- the fund for agricultural 
restructuring and debt-rescheduling. Some 1.2 trillion zlotys 
(47 million USd) from a World Bank loan are to be earmarked for 
the development of countryside infrastructure.

  [Text] Gdansk, Jan. 4 -- The Presidium of the National 
Commission of the Solidarity trade union discussed in Gdansk 
today issues related to the implementation of the pact on state 
enterprises and the establishment of a tripartite commission 
representing employers, the government and trade unions. 
  Deputy Minister of Labour and Social Policy Andrzej 
Baczkowski, present at the meeting, expressed his hope at a 
press conference in Gdansk that the establishment of the 
commission would be possible in January. He also declared that 
by January 7 the government would take stands on all agreements 
concluded with Solidarity. 
  Baczkowski also said that the draft privatization law 
included in the enterprise pact is in the last stage of 
interministerial consultations. He added that the government 
would seek a consensus with trade unions about concrete 
legislative solutions and not the trade unions' opinion on the 
final version of the draft. Matters of argument could be 
presented to the Sejm along with the draft law, he said. 
  Solidarity Chairman Marian Krzaklewski termed the draft 
budget law as "conflict-prone" while not taking into account 
"dynamic methods of compensating for rises in costs of living" 
in view of planned rises in energy prices and rents. According 
to him, the rules of the so called social safety net should be 
clearly defined before the adoption of the budget law.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 4/1/1994 -- On the last but one 
day of 1993, former Colonel General Iulian Vlad, former chief of 
the State Security Department until 22 December 1989, when the 
Ceausescus were overthrown, was set free on probation, under the 
decision of a Bucharest district court. The decision of the 
court was explained by the fact that the over 60-year-old 
convict had already served one-third of his penalty. His health 
condition and the good conduct while he was in prison were two 
more reasons sustaining the decision. 
  Iulian Vlad, directly involved in the December 1989 events, 
was sued in court on 3 August 1990, through the bill of 
indictment of the Military Prosecutors' Department of Romania's 
Prosecutor's Office. The bill of indictment listed his 
participation in the meetings of the [Romanian Communist Party] 
Executive Political Committee of 17 and 22 December 1989, when 
"he agreed to the decision to use firearms against demonstrators 
in Timisoara and other localities in the country." 
  On 28 April 1992 the Supreme Court of Justice, ruling on the 
appeal filed by the Department of Military Prosecutor's Offices, 
decided to change the indictment from abetting genocide to 
instrumentality to aggravated attempted murder, sentencing 
Iulian Vlad to 12 years of prison, 6 years of banned rights, and 
military demotion. 
  Ex-General Vlad told daily EVENIMENTUL ZILEI on his release: 
"I think the Romanian justice has done is duty to the full, a 
fact that allows me now to return to the society with the 
feeling that I have expiated my sins."

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 3/1/1994 -- The Romanian 
Government plans to withhold on a line of cautious fiscal, 
monetary, and budgetary policies in 1994 and 1995, says the 
letter of intent and the memorandum for the following two years 
agreed with the International Monetary Fund. The letter was 
forwarded by the prime minister [Nicolae Vacaroiu] to parliament

  The said policies will be implemented through a package of 
measures of structural reform including an accelerated 
privatization and restructuring of the enterprises, deep reforms 
of the fiscal and financial sector, and the establishing of a 
inter-bank currency market. 
  The memorandum of economic policy contains details of these 
policies aiming to achieve the economic goals of the government. 
The Romanian Government requests a 19-month stand-by agreement 
with the IMF to make available 131.95 million special drawing 
rights [SDR] plus two drawings totalling 377 SDR [figure as 
received], half of which within the structural transformation 
facility and following the approval of the memorandum, with the 
other half available by the date of the finalization of the 
first assessment by the IMF scheduled for 15 November 1994. The 
second assessment is scheduled for 15 May 1995. The first 
assessment is expected to outline the macro-economic, budgetary, 
and monetary objectives for 1995 and to reassess the estimations 
for external financing needs.

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 5 (CTK) -- Slovakia considers 
neither the Czechoslovak Airlines (CSA) issue nor the merchant 
navy issue to be settled, as far as the division of the property 
of the former Czechoslovak Ministry of Transport and 
Telecommunications is concerned, Slovak Minister of Transport 
and Telecommunications Roman Hofbauer said today. 
  He told CTK that through international arbitration Slovakia 
will try to achieve the abolition of the trade names 
Ceskoslovenske aerolinie (CSA), Ceskoslovenska namorni doprava 
(Czechoslovak Merchant Navy) and Ceskoslovenska autobusova 
doprava (Czechoslovak Bus Transport). 
  "The names of these organisations are connected with a 
non-existent state," said Hofbauer and added that the Czech side 
had been notified of Slovakia's intentions, but had not reacted 
to them. 
  The Slovak Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications last 
year managed to successfully ensure the devolution of all powers 
from the Federation to the new state, and supported the founding 
of many new institutions non-existent in Slovakia under the 
Federation, Hofbauer said at a press conference. 
  He described as very important Slovakia's joining of 20 
international organisations, 13 of them governmental and seven 
non-governmental. 
  According to Hofbauer, foreign financial institutions are 
interested in investments in transport and telecommunications in 
Slovakia. The World Bank is interested in modernising railroad 
transport, while the European Investment Bank is interested in 
modernising aviation and airports, he said.

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 5 (CTK) -- The disputed sections of 
the Czech-Slovak border are likely to be discussed by the two 
countries' interior ministers, Stanislav Becic, chairman of the 
Slovak delegation to the joint Czech-Slovak Border Commission 
tells today's issue of the left-orientated PRAVDA. 
  According to Becic, 63 percent or 270 kilometres, of the 
state border had been set by mid-December. Where the state 
border is formed by the Morava River, it runs along its middle, 
and the boundary stones are being placed on its banks. 
  On the issue of the 128 hectares Slovakia allegedly lost due 
to the regulation of the Morava River, Becic said that Slovakia 
had asked the Czech Republic to compensate for the territory at 
the Javornik settlement. "No settlement has been arrived at. 
No agreement has been reached regarding the Czech demands for 
the Kasarna weekend-house region and part of the Sidonia 
settlement either," Becic reports. 
  According to Becic, the Czech Republic considers the border 
sections Slovakia proposes to resolve to be disputable. By 
contrast, Slovakia believes there is no disputable section along 
the whole length of the border, since the state border should be 
in line with the current administrative border. 
  Becic says that if the documents from 1938 are compared, 15 
differences between the current administrative and the former 
borders have been found. 
  The commission has not arrived at an agreement in four cases 
(Sidonia, Kasarna and Vrbovce settlements, and the Morava River) 
and will not discuss them any more. "The proposals to resolve 
the situation will be dealt with by the ministers at their 
forthcoming meeting. If they, too, do not come to an agreement, 
the cases will be settled at the governmental level," Becic 
states.

  [Text] Bratislava Dec 31 (CTK) -- Slovak Foreign and 
Passport Police seized travel documents from Ivan Lexa, chairman 
of the Government Office, in connection with the accusation of 
defamation of the state and its representative, the pro-Meciar 
daily REPUBLIKA writes today. 
  Lexa is alleged to have cast doubt on the morals of the 
president and his professional capabilities in connection with 
his age. 
  According to the paper, Lexa considers it absurd that the 
Slovak criminal bodies deem his case to be so important that 
they made it impossible for him to travel abroad. He considers 
the unprecedented political trial to be comparable with those 
communist from the 1950's.

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 4 (CTK) -- A group of citizens from 
the southern Slovak town of Komarno are seeking to dismiss 
Komarno Mayor Isztvan Pasztor, a leader of the Hungarian 
minority in southern Slovakia, Slovak Radio reported today. 
According to the radio, local discontent with the mayor's 
approach to solving daily problems of the town was the reason. 
Petitions demanding the mayor's resignation have been put up by 
civic initiatives at many places in the town and a public rally 
was called for Wednesday [5 January] in the headquarters of the 
Slovak cultural organisation Matica Slovenska. 
  Pasztor as chairman of the Council of the Association of 
Towns and Villages of the Zitny Island, is an initiator of a 
meeting of deputies and mayors from southern Slovakia scheduled 
for January 8 in Komarno to demand the establishment of a 
"region with special status" in southern Slovakia populated by a 
large Hungarian minority. Matica Slovenska has sharply 
condemned the meeting.

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 4 (CTK) -- Chairman of the 
Egyutteles Hungarian minority movement in Slovakia, Miklos 
Duray, today confirmed that the Komarno meeting convened by the 
Hungarian parliamentary parties in spite of the reservations 
raised by the Slovak president, government and parliament is 
aimed at creating a "region with special legal status" in 
southern Slovakia. 
  Egyutteles respects the laws and the Constitution and does 
not seek the revision of the state borders with Hungary, Duray 
said, adding that his movement wants to strive to ensure rights 
for the Hungarian minority only as a legal part of the Slovak 
Republic. It is only by coincidence that the Komarno meeting 
will take place on the eve of U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
meeting with the presidents of the Visegrad countries in Prague, 
Duray said. 
  Egyutteles demands that the ethnic principle is taken into 
account while introducing the new territorial division of 
Slovakia, he said, adding that his party intended to propose 
that the Komarno meeting appeal to the Slovak parliament to 
ratify the European Parliament Charter of European Towns and 
Regions. The Slovak Republic has not yet joined this agreement.

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 3 (CTK) -- A meeting of Slovak 
nationalists in Surany and the planned gathering in Komarno 
signal that neither Slovaks nor the Hungarian minority are 
content in southern regions of Slovakia where Hungarians live, 
Democratic Left Party (SDL) Deputy Chairman Pavol Kanis told CTK 
today. 
  He said the view that the high-ranking officials of 
Slovakia's Hungarian parliamentary parties are some sort of 
"lone runners" without any background seems to be unsound, as 
current opinion polls indicate that the Egyutteles Hungarian 
minority movement and the Hungarian Christian Democratic 
Movement (MKDH) each represent 20 percent of the ethnic 
Hungarian population. 
  Kanis said the worst shortcoming lies in the conceptlessness 
of the Slovak Government and parliament in their approach to 
ethnic minority issues. He said this approach should be changed 
and these problems solved "comprehensively and definitively," 
since the failure to do so was constantly giving rise to new 
Hungarian demands. 
  He said the SDL had long pointed to the necessity of solving 
national minority problems with a constitutional law, but that 
this had not been done. That Hungarian representatives 
submitted such a bill to Parliament Chairman Ivan Gasparovic 
last summer and that this bill was "swept off the table," as 
they said, was unfortunate, Kanis said. 
  The problems of Hungarian and Slovak co-existence in 
southern 
Slovakia has become an international one, he said. That is why 
it should be seen with "European eyes." That the SDL was a 
representative of the forces which "want to reach a compromise" 
is proved by its exemplary relations with the Hungarian 
Socialist Party, Kanis said.

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 3 (CTK) -- The Alliance of Slovak 
Democrats (ADSR), at the forthcoming parliamentary session, will 
support a Christian Democratic Movement's (KDH) request for the 
resignation of Minister of Transport and Telecommunications 
Roman Hofbauer, ADSR Deputy Igor Gazdik told CTK today. 
  Gazdik said the reason for this was Hofbauer's bad 
performance, especially his callous approach to the removal of 
bilingual road signs for towns and villages in southern Slovakia 
and the termination by his ministry of an agreement with Radio 
Free Europe to broadcast in Slovakia. He said that opposition 
parties have discussed their course of action in connection with 
Hofbauer's dismissal as they did in the case of former Health 
Minister Viliam Sobona. 
  ADSR Deputy Chairman Rudolf Filkus told CTK that the broader 
government coalition which Slovak President Michal Kovac pleaded 
for in this New Year's address was a "precondition for the joint 
resolution of the decisive questions in Slovak society." 
  He said it was not just empty talk that foreign capital was 
waiting for unambiguous signals of political stabilisation in 
Slovakia, and that the stability of the government was a 
necessary step towards political stabilisation. 
  Filkus ruled out the possibility of forming a broader 
government coalition under the leadership of the current Slovak 
premier and chairman of the ruling Movement For a Democratic 
Slovakia, Vladimir Meciar. He said the results of the 1992 
parliamentary elections should be taken into consideration while 
forming a new multi-party coalition. He also said a member of 
the HZDS would be charged with forming a government in such an 
event, and that current Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik or 
Deputy Premier Roman Kovac would be the most appropriate 
candidates.

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 3 (CTK) -- The efforts by the 
opposition Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) to dismiss Slovak 
Minister of Transport and Communications Roman Hofbauer is only 
a "partial" solution, Slovak National Party (SNS) Chairman 
Ludovit Cernak told CTK today. 
  KDH Chairman Jan Carnogursky, in a statement given to CTK 
December 29, said his movement would propose Hofbauer's 
resignation at the next parliamentary session on the grounds of 
his bad performance which "culminated with the ministry's 
decision to terminate on January 31, 1994, an agreement with 
Radio Free Europe to broadcast its programme in Slovakia by 
means of this country's radio transmitters." 
  Cernak said he believed the current situation on the Slovak 
political scene needed a fundamental solution. He said he did 
not favour a method of trimming from the government, adding that 
Slovak President Michal Kovac indicated possible solutions to 
the current situation in Slovakia in his new year address. 
  The possibility of forming a broad coalition mentioned by 
Kovac corresponds to SNS policy, Cernak stressed, adding that 
also within the current coalition with the ruling Movement For a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) the SNS backs the idea of cooperation 
of several political entities. "We fully support the ideas of 
the president," he stressed. 
  The SNS Deputies' Club divided into two factions at the last 
parliamentary session -- a national democratic one led by Cernak 
and another one led by Deputy Premier Marian Andel which 
supports Slovak Premier and HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar. 
According to SNS parliamentary deputy Igor Chamula, Hofbauer's 
resignation has not yet been discussed by the SNS Deputies' 
Group.

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 5 (CTK) -- Last year Slovakia lost 
too much wasting time, and the talent and goodwill of its 
population, Igor Uhrik, deputy chairman of the Slovak National 
Party (SNS), told journalists today. 
  He said he considered 1993 to be a lost year because 
Slovakia 
lost its good initial position it had acquired after the 1992 
elections. All of this was caused by the HZDS's (ruling 
Movement For a Democratic Slovakia) refusal to share power and 
decision-making after it won the elections. At that time, it 
was possible to create a broad coalition called for by President 
Michal Kovac in his New Year's address, Uhrik said. 
  The fact that the HZDS (66 deputies in the 150-seat Slovak 
parliament) started to discuss coalition with the SNS (14 
deputies) only last summer is an evidence of the failed policy 
of the party which had been refusing to share power for a year, 
Uhrik stated. 
  The principles of cooperation between the two parties will 
have to be somewhat modified now. The SNS cannot play the role 
of a mere "tool in the electoral machinery" in the coalition, 
Uhrik concluded.

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 5 (CTK) -- Ludovit Cernak, chairman 
of the Slovak National Party (SNS), told journalists today that 
he considered it his most urgent task "to clear his own table, 
address the public frankly and show willingness to cooperate." 
  Cernak said that the SNS was the first party to propose the 
creation of the government of a broader coalition, and had 
adopted this idea as a part of its programme at the last year's 
conference in Ruzomberok, Central Slovakia. That is why he 
identified himself with the words of Slovak President Michal 
Kovac, who promoted the idea of broader coalition in his New 
Year's speech, he added. 
  Cernak said he regretted that the SNS leadership's control 
over the party has dwindled away, that party principles have 
ceased to be effective, and the party has taken a position in 
which it identified itself with its political partner the 
Movement For a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), the SNS' government 
coalition partner. 
  In the days to come, the SNS leadership and the Central 
Council will decide on the party's future attitude to the 
coalition questions, Cernak said. He did not rule out that even 
an SNS conference will be convoked as the party supreme body. 
  SNS representatives are to attend today's regular HZDS 
meeting. However, SNS Deputy Chairman Igor Uhrik said that SNS 
leaders had learnt this only from today's press. He said that 
as far as he knew, no SNS representative had been officially 
invited to the meeting. HZDS is obviously striving to push 
through a certain group of SNS deputies, whose philosophy is 
accommodated to the HZDS policy, Uhrik concluded.

  [Excerpts] Bratislava, Jan 4 (CTK) -- [passage omitted] 
"Do not let us be misled by the demand of an accommodating 
approach as we have no space for retreat," Deputy Chairman of 
the Slovak Parliament and a leader of the governing Movement for 
a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) Augustin Marian Huska reacts to the 
calls for change in Slovak Government in the pro-Meciar daily 
REPUBLIKA, published by the Slovak News Agency TA SR. 
  "Foreign hegemonic leaders and their domestic lackeys are 
spreading again reports on the danger of dictatorship, that the 
premier is not bearable for abroad and for the `sobered-up' 
society and that he is allegedly unbearable even for the 
Hungarian partners, that the situation demands a complaisant and 
servile `expert' government which would `listen' more to the 
great-Hungarian and Czechoslovakist advice," Huska says. "It 
contradicts the Czech interests because (the current Slovak 
Government) does not want to accept the forged balance of the 
Czechoslovak State Bank which made Slovakia a debtor instead of 
creditor. The attack on the inconvenient government is also a 
punishment for the fact that we dared to emancipate ourselves," 
he states. 
  According to Huska, "the great power vacuum awakened the 
egoistic ambitions of our southern neighbor. It is blindly 
striding towards the vision of at first a `mid-sized' and then a 
Great Hungary. Should we create because of these unruly 
interests a less resistant government?" 
  "The American senators and congressmen for the Democratic 
Party told us openly in early December that the only reasonable 
policy is not to comply with foreign hunger for territory, it is 
a radical, unyielding, transformation-minded government which 
defends the interests of the Slovak society. They told us that 
when up against foreign interests, the most successful and 
efficient are unyielding and incorruptible authorities," Huska 
claims. 
  "The stability of the Slovak Government system is the 
supreme 
priority of our freedom, it means more than anything else for 
us," Huska concludes.

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 3 (CTK) -- Oil from Ukraine is 
flowing into Slovakia on the Latorica River, and the Slovak 
Accident Commission estimates that the flow is expected to 
continue for about two more days, Stanislav Vikartovsky, manager 
of the Kralovsky Chlmec (East Slovakia) Civil Defense 
Department, told CTK. 
  The site of the accident is about eighty kilometers from the 
Slovak border, near the city of Mukachevo in Sub-Carpathian Rus, 
where a pipeline has ruptured. 
  Vikartovsky refuted media reports that the river is covered 
by a layer of oil 20-25 centimeters deep. These reports are 
exaggerated, he said. He reported that three underwater walls 
have been built in the river in Slovakia to catch the oil. 
However, some of the polluted water is flowing into Hungary. 
  He also said that Slovakia is trying to obtain more 
information on the extent of the spill near Mukachevo, but very 
little information from Ukraine has been received so far. 
  Because the river has overflowed its banks, samples of well 
water are being tested in surrounding communities. So far no 
oil contamination has been found in well water, Vikartovsky said. 
  Last October, the East Slovak Uh River and its surroundings 
were polluted by an oil spill on the Ukrainian side. To this 
day, wells in the area are contaminated with oil, and 
inhabitants must get water from other sources. However, Ukraine 
did not inform Slovak authorities at all. The situation is 
complicated by the lack of a Slovak-Ukrainian agreement on 
common rivers, as exists between Slovakia and Hungary.

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 4 (CTK) -- The conditions for 
partial German funding of the construction of the nuclear power 
plant in Mochovce, West Slovakia, are to be specified in 
January, Slovak Vice-Premier for Economy Sergej Kozlik announced 
today. Kozlik took part in negotiations today with the German 
ambassador to Slovakia, Heike Zenker, on the completion of 
construction work in Mochovce and its financing. The key 
issues, in his opinion, concern the repayment of German loans 
through supplies of nuclear energy to Germany and the closing of 
the nuclear power plant in Jaslovske Bohunice, West Slovakia, on 
which the realization of the project is conditional. Kozlik 
said that clear economic calculations are necessary if Slovakia 
is to prove she can be depended on to repay her loans. A total 
of 1.5 billion DEM [German marks] in foreign loans is to be 
provided for the construction of the nuclear power plant in 
Mochovce.

  [Text] Pristina, January 5 (ATA) -- Upon the initiative of 
a group of citizens in Presheva, signatures for a petition are 
being taken for the lifting of taxes in the border points in 
Presheva, between rump Yugoslavia and the former Republic of 
Macedonia. The application of taxes affects all citizens, 
especially Albanians, because the Albanians of Presheva have 
many family relations with the Albanians of Macedonia, who have 
unjustly been divided by artificial borders. Since the first of 
January 1994, the border authorities of rump Yugoslavia demand 
10 DM per person and 30 DM per vehicle before leaving them to 
pass the border.

  [Curic] Minister Granic and Prime Minister Silajdzic are 
holding talks with cochairmen Owen and Stoltenberg. At around 
1300 the two delegations ended this round of talks, which was 
held in preparation for the Geneva conference scheduled for 18 
January. Both sides accepted a peaceful political resolution of 
the crisis. The talks were constructive despite a difficult 
situation on the ground. Both sides acknowledged the situation 
and the danger of a wider escalation of the conflict. Croatia 
firmly insists on Neum and is against [granting the Muslims] 
access to the sea near Prevlaka, which the cochairmen proposed. 
  A joint statement was coordinated and issued. Both sides 
confirmed that an urgent cease-fire, a permanent cessation of 
hostilities, and a permanent normalization of relations between 
the Croat and Bosniak peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina, including 
territorial, political, humanitarian, and other aspects of a 
permanent resolution, were in the long-term and strategic 
interest of both peoples and the two states. In light of this, 
it was agreed that Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and 
President of Bosnia-Herzegovina Alija Izetbegovic should meet in 
Bonn on 8 January 1994. 
  Special attention at the talks was devoted to the need to 
fully and consistently respect previous cease-fire agreements, 
particularly because of the situation in central Bosnia. The 
two sides confirmed that in preparing for the summit, efforts 
would be made to prepare a comprehensive plan for implementing 
the cease-fire along the entire front line and ending all combat 
operations to create conditions for a permanent cessation of 
hostilities, the protection of the population, and the 
implementation of confidence-building measures, the joint 
statement says. 
  Both sides confirmed that the disputes on territorial 
demarcation should be resolved only by peaceful, political means 
without the use of force and in accordance with the Sarajevo 
declaration dated 12 November 1993. As far as humanitarian 
issues are concerned, it was agreed that a commission for 
humanitarian issues should meet on 7 January to reach an 
agreement on free movement of humanitarian convoys, including 
discussion on establishing new routes as well as securing the 
evacuation of the wounded and providing permanent supplies for 
hospitals. It was agreed to provide all necessary guarantees 
and documents for free passage of a field hospital for the 
eastern [Muslim-held] port of Mostar by 6 January. It was also 
agreed that the commission for exchange of prisoners should meet 
on 11 January. A meeting of the Mostar commission should be 
held on 7 January in the headquarters of the UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] Spanish battalion in Medjugorje to prepare a 
program for the revitalization of Mostar and the return of 
citizens of Mostar to their city, in keeping with agreements 
reached at the last round of negotiations in Brussels. The 
agreement on the establishment of a free port zone in Ploce was 
confirmed. 
  We should also mention that for the first time proposals 
were 
put forward for the bilateral demarcation of the two republics 
[Herceg-Bosna and Bosnia]. The proposals are different but they 
represent a basis for more concrete talks. The Muslims have 
demanded sovereignty near Neum and the Croats have firmly 
rejected this. There are areas about which the two sides could 
negotiate bilaterally, without the third side. A meeting with 
the cochairmen, Owen and Stoltenberg, is in progress.

  [Text] [Unidentified announcer] In Vienna, the delegations 
of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina ended their talks this 
afternoon. A joint statement has been released. The statement 
reiterates the imperative that a cease-fire should immediately 
take effect; there should be a lasting cessation of hostilities 
as well as a lasting basis for regulating relations between the 
Croat and Bosnian peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  It has been agreed that Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic 
will meet on 8 January. An agreement was also confirmed in 
Vienna on a free-trade zone in the port of Ploce. The 
cease-fire plan will be discussed in Bonn. Peace mediators Owen 
and Stoltenberg said that a cease-fire agreement alone would not 
solve the problem because in Bosnia-Herzegovina 69 cease-fires 
had been agreed so far while the end of the war was still not 
yet in sight. 
  Due to the protracted grave situation on the ground, 
proposals were tabled for the first time for mutual demarcation 
between the Croats and Muslims. The two sides agree that an 
immediate cease-fire and a lasting cessation of hostilities is 
in the interest of both peoples and both states. In Bonn on 
Saturday Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic will also discuss 
the organization of future political, military, territorial, and 
humanitarian relations between the two peoples. 
  [Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic] "This is by all 
accounts the most precious result of today's and yesterday's 
meetings. This means that at the meeting of the two presidents 
they will also talk about a cease-fire." 
  [Unidentified announcer] Being aware of the risks in the 
event of these conflicts on the ground deepening and spreading, 
both sides accepted peaceful solutions to the problems. They 
particularly discussed the need for full compliance with the 
existing cease-fires, especially so in central Bosnia. A 
comprehensive plan is being drawn up for the implementation of 
the cease-fire along front lines, including a suspension of all 
military activity, thus creating preconditions for a lasting 
cessation of hostilities. This plan, which must be finalized by 
Saturday, will include protection for the population and 
trust-building measures. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] "Do you believe there is some 
chance of an agreement on a cessation of hostilities in Bonn on 
Saturday?" 
  [Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic] "Talking 
about whether there is any chance, the answer is, in fact, yes. 
The answer to this question is yes. This will not be simple. 
I can see that there is goodwill and this is why my answer is 
yes, there is a chance." 
  [Unidentified announcer] An agreement was also reached on a 
free-trade zone in the port of Ploce. The cochairmen's 
suggestion about access to the sea near Prevlaka was explicitly 
rejected. For the first time, envoys Granic and Silajdzic told 
each other their territorial demands. For the first time, the 
Muslims discussed Croatia's stands on territories. On the 
ground in Bosnia, in the shadow of death, a diplomatic 
foundation for a new peace was found. 
  [Granic] "Both sides have taken on an obligation to do their 
best to implement the existing agreements and signed agreements. 
This means putting an end to all conflicts. In any case, to us 
this therefore means that the Bosnian Muslim offensive on the 
Croat enclaves in central Bosnia should stop, and so should 
conflicts along all frontlines between the Croats and Muslims in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. This will also be one of the main topics of 
the Tudjman-Izetbegovic meeting." 
  [Unidentified announcer] Some of the most important results 
are the humanitarian solutions -- a special commission will 
ensure the crossing of a field hospital to the left bank in 
Mostar tomorrow [6 January], the reconstruction of the 
devastated city, and the return of expelled persons according to 
the Brussels agreement. This will be discussed by the working 
group for Mostar. 
  [Granic] "We have achieved several concrete results. This 
might not seem enough, the situation being what it is, but we 
believe this to be a step forward -- especially regarding the 
humanitarian situation, the Mostar issue. 
  "The talks were held in a constructive atmosphere. We hope 
it stays the same in future, but most of all we hope that these 
measures and agreements at certain levels will result in a 
cessation of hostilities -- this is the most important thing, 
without this all these agreements will acquire a completely 
different dimension. I hope we will succeed." 
  [Unidentified announcer] A special commission will meet on 7 
January to discuss the passage of humanitarian convoys, the 
evacuation of the wounded, and the long-term supplying of 
hospitals. A commission for the exchange of prisoners will meet 
on 11 January.

<F P=106> [Statement "exclusively for Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio and </F>
Television" by Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic 
on his 5 January meeting with Croatian representatives in Vienna 
-- live or recorded] 
  [Text] Today's meeting had several specific items, i.e. 
results. First, both sides insisted on restarting convoys, that 
is the passage of humanitarian convoys, including a debate on 
new routes. We maintain that as much food as possible should 
enter Bosnia-Herzegovina from various directions. We all know 
that despite an agreement, there were problems with the last two 
convoys, for Nova Bila and Maglaj. On 6 January the possibility 
will be examined of sending further humanitarian convoys from 
various directions. We spent a great deal of time discussing 
this, so we hope that this operation will be successful. 
Unfortunately, the last convoy for Nova Bila and Maglaj -- we 
all know that the convoy for Maglaj has not reached its 
destination because of the Serb side. The food is still in 
Zenica. We hope that this time we will have more luck. 
  We also talked about the field hospital which has for months 
been kept in the port of Ploce. This is a mobile hospital 
stored in about 40 containers, and it has been impossible to 
transfer it to its destination as specified by the donor, to the 
left bank of Mostar. In other words, the field hospital should 
leave Ploce very soon for the left bank in Mostar, where it is 
being awaited eagerly in view of a large number of wounded 
[words indistinct]. It cannot possibly reach the left bank of 
Mostar. [passage indistinct] 
  We also agreed to hold a meeting to discuss exchanges of 
prisoners. This is a very important issue, a very difficult 
issue. This is nevertheless a question that constantly straddles 
the path to resolving some other problems we are going to try to 
solve. As for agreements about Mostar, our public knows that it 
has been agreed that Mostar is to be placed under EC 
administration for up to two years. Hence, during this period 
some solutions should be found. We called this, in a rather 
popular way, the Mostar for the Mostarers project. In any case 
we agreed that a meeting between these two commissions be also 
held on 7 January at the Spanish UN Protection Forces Battalion 
headquarters in Medjugorje, and that the question of preparing 
programs of restoration and revitalization and the return of 
Mostarers to their town be approached in line with what was 
agreed in Brussels. 
  We discussed the port of Ploce. There were some.... [pauses] 
The latest meeting in Brussels revealed that the Croatian side 
had made changes to our last agreement, reached on the 
Invincible, in other words, a free zone in the port of Ploce in 
line with the agreement reached on board the Invincible. These 
are some of the concrete results of our meeting. These are some 
of the concrete results of our meeting. 
  We also discussed a cease-fire. This has always been the 
most difficult problem. We did not want to say anything 
resolute or precise on a cease-fire. There can be no cease-fire 
for a day or two. We have to reach an agreement on the ground 
and we also have to agree about the technicalities, date, etc. 
Let us hope that some results will be achieved over this. I 
must say that this is the most difficult point of our talks. 
All I can say on my part is that the talks were held in a 
constructive working atmosphere. We are aware of the fact that 
we made a small step forward and I can just add on my part that 
the constructive atmosphere was a result of efforts on the part 
of everyone. Mr. Akmadzic represented the Herzegovina side this 
time and I think this greatly contributed to the talks taking a 
positive and not a negative turn. Let us hope this will remain 
so in the future, and we have guarantees from the Croatian side 
that Mr. Akmadzic will from now on represent this side and we 
see this as a positive development.

  [Text] In contrast to the small countries of Central Europe 
and those in the area that still continue to split up, Russia is 
a great power as far as the United States and other NATO members 
are concerned. It is a country with which they are having to 
reckon. Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has declared this in 
reaction to the remark made by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, 
who today called on NATO member countries to disperse Russia's 
fears that they have adopted a duplicitous attitude on this 
issue. 
  Yeltsin also warned against the negative reaction of the 
Russian public in case the bloc is expanded. He described the 
arguments of those countries striving to gain entry into NATO as 
unconvincing. Prime Minister Klaus is conscious that Russia 
regards this to be a sensitive issue. However, there is no need 
for fear yet because, as the prime minister has said, no one has 
offered us NATO membership.

  [Text] The Czech cabinet discussed in Prague today 
technical details of the visit to Prague next week of U.S. 
President Bill Clinton and an increase in the number of police. 
Our Prague correspondent, Daniela Galikova, attended the ensuing 
news conference and filed the following report: 
  [Galikova] Replying to a question from Slovak radio, Czech 
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus confirmed the planned talks with 
Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar as well as with the prime 
ministers of Poland and Hungary, which will take place after the 
talks with the U.S. President. On the evening of 12 
January--that is, after the U.S. President departs--the Czech 
president, prime minister, and foreign minister will give 
dinners. According to Prime Minister Klaus, the presidents of 
Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic will dine at 
the Castle, the prime ministers of these countries will dine at 
Prime Minister Klaus's invitation in Lichtenstein Palace, and 
the foreign ministers will dine at the Czech Foreign Ministry. 
  Responding to another question concerning the summit, Prime 
Minister Klaus stressed that, right from the beginning, as soon 
as President Clinton's intention to visit Prague was announced, 
the Czech Republic did not doubt that it would use the meeting 
for holding talks with the representatives of the Visegrad Group 
countries. At no time was it considered that only we would be 
holding talks or that the talks would be held collectively, the 
Czech prime minister stressed. He thus reacted to some reports 
carried by both the domestic and foreign press that the Czech 
Republic did not support the idea of joint talks between the 
representatives of the Visegrad Group and the U.S. President.

<F P=106> [Report by sr: "According to Klaus, Higher Bodies Are Not </F>
the Most Urgent Problem"] 
  [Text] Prague--As Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said on the 
Debata television program on CT1 yesterday, he knows there are 
much more important and urgent problems than the establishment 
of higher administrative bodies. Thus he responded in the new 
program to questions by reporters concerning the establishment 
of these bodies and the state administration reform. 
  Moreover, he said that it is questionable whether this issue 
requires an immediate and deep involvement. He, himself, as he 
said, will not support this rather harsh approach. He said 
further that he supports such an approach only if he is certain 
that an immediate and harsh solution to a particular problem is 
useful and necessary. At present, however, he does not see the 
constitutional arrangement as the most important and urgent 
problem. 
  Further, the prime minister pointed out that the higher 
territorial bodies "undoubtedly will cost something, and it will 
not be little." Here, he added, one could ask whether the price 
is worth the gain brought about by the establishment and 
operation of these bodies. To a direct question concerning the 
quality of the documentation submitted by Kalvoda's Office for 
Legislature and Public Administration regarding the issue of the 
constitutional arrangement reform, Klaus replied that this 
document is a topic for discussion in the government, but he 
added that the document does not deal with the problem of 
financing the establishment of the higher administrative bodies. 
"Some people see only the advantages of the administrative 
bodies, others are concerned precisely with the cost of their 
establishment and operation. That is the basic conflict," the 
prime minister added. According to him, the questions of powers, 
budget, financing, property relations between the territorial 
bodies, and other points that are connected with the 
administrative reform have not yet been solved. Nevertheless, he 
himself does not reject the administrative reform, and the Civic 
Democratic Party will not, according to him, block the emergence 
of the higher bodies. In this context, he pointed out that the 
government found a solution to the constitutional arrangement 
problem, which was sent to the parliament just before the end of 
last year in the form of draft principles for the constitutional 
law on the establishment of higher autonomous territorial bodies 
and a schedule for legislative measures toward the 
implementation of the administrative reform. He also mentioned 
individual deadlines for the implementation of the gradual steps 
that would lead to the establishment of higher bodies. He 
denied, however, that the coalition leaders agreed on some 
specific date for the election to these bodies. Nevertheless, he 
said that for many reasons it would not be desirable for the 
elections to take place every year. 
  [Bratislava REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 4 January on page 9 also 
carries a report on Klaus's appearance on the television program 
and adds: "Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus rejected on the 
Czech Television program that part of President Vaclav Havel's 
New Year's address that deals with the tasks of the Cabinet. 
Klaus is convinced that his government is paying equal attention 
to all important issues."]

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Prime Minister Jan Kalvoda by Roman </F>
Krasnicky; place and date not given: "I Am Afraid of People's 
Apathy"] 
  [Text] Jan Kalvoda, deputy prime minister and chairman of 
the Civic Democratic Alliance [ODA], is a politician who, unlike 
the prime minister, unequivocally favors the reforms of the 
self-administration system. However, Kalvoda is ruling out the 
possibility that the coalition could disintegrate because of 
those reforms. 
  [Krasnicky] According to Deputy V. Dobal, the ODA has 
reached the conclusion that the government is unreliable in that 
respect. This is why they are going to draft a law on nonprofit 
organizations. How do you feel as a member of the government 
and, at the same time, a member of the party that is criticizing 
the government? 
  [Kalvoda] This reflects tensions between the government and 
parliament. This anomaly ensues from the coalition mechanisms. 
Yes, I am a member of a party that is stressing the need for a 
general adjustment to the nonprofit sector and has a strong idea 
about the fact that a law should be drafted that would create 
room for civic activity. All government members play this double 
role inasmuch as they are dependent on their party and their 
sector. The situation, however, has not exceeded tenable limits. 
  [Krasnicky] The prime minister yesterday signed a schedule 
for reforming the public administration. Did you not feel quite 
lonely when fighting for this reform? Did other ODA ministers 
support you? It might seem that this is a Kalvoda-Klaus personal 
dispute.... 
  [Kalvoda] I do not want to divulge any details from 
government meetings, but I can say that two ODA ministers, apart 
from myself, were of the same opinion. This dispute is not a 
dispute between two individuals. If you just look at the ODA 
election program, you can see that the self-administration issue 
plays a key role. We know that we have to implement this reform 
now. Time is important in this case. The thing is that citizens 
have to be given, apart from assurances that they have powers, a 
new role in that self-administration. If this does not happen 
right now, I am afraid that the apathy we observe today will 
increase even more. 
  [Krasnicky] Vaclav Klaus is pointing to the risks ensuing 
from territorial and administrative reform. He is afraid, for 
example, that the principle of civic solidarity could be 
endangered if the new system of local budgets is implemented. 
Are you also aware of certain risks? 
  [Kalvoda] No. This seems to be a misunderstanding to me. It 
has been evident since the very beginning--when we signed the 
coalition agreement--that a self-administration unit without its 
own income is no self-administration unit at all. This is not a 
new risk factor. This is a needed feature that any 
self-administrative unit must have, as a rack wagon must have 
wheels. Documents that I presented to the government over the 
summer contain two basic models for financing regions and lands. 
We could also redistribute the financial sources through the 
state budget, like they are doing in the northern, mostly social 
democratic, countries--that is, we could try to set up dozens of 
objective criteria, according to which money from the state 
budget would flow into self-administrative units. According to 
another alternative that I am supporting, the new units could 
receive their income from taxes. 
  [Krasnicky] You have mentioned cooperation within the 
coalition several times. What are the reasons for the 
misunderstanding? Is prestige sometimes involved? 
  [Kalvoda] All the issues, whether we want 
self-administration or not, whether we want nonprofit 
organizations or not, are conceptual issues. As someone who is 
present at the negotiations, I cannot objectively say whether 
personal views prevail in this dispute. Emotions should not play 
any role in politics.

<F P=106> ["Third Memorandum of Slovaks from Southern Slovakia," </F>
adopted at the "sixth meeting of Slovaks living in southern 
Slovakia" in Surany on 2 January] 
  [Text] We Slovaks, living since time immemorial in the 
south of our homeland, appeal, in a situation that we cannot 
call anything but one in which the state is endangered, to the 
president, parliament, and Government of the Slovak Republic. 
  Now it is no longer just a matter of concern to us, who feel 
discriminated against and endangered in our own country, a fact 
to which we have been drawing attention, so far in vain, in our 
earlier memorandums from 1990-93. 
  The appeal, issued by the so-called Association of Zitny 
Ostrov Towns and Villages and that which is planned for Komarno 
on 8 January 1994, is an obvious anticonstitutional attempt to 
subvert the state. Therefore, we appeal: 
  1. To the supreme state bodies of the Slovak Republic not to 
permit anticonstitutional goings-on in that assembly, and their 
consequences. 
  2. To the National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR] to 
revise its resolution of 23 June 1993 (concerning Council of 
Europe recommendation Number 1201) in accordance with the 
Constitution and the legal system of the Slovak Republic. 
  3. To the NRSR to pass a law on the protection of the state 
language. 
  4. To ensure that at least one Slovak school or class be 
functioning in every community of the Slovak Republic. 
  5. To ensure that, in the bilingual designation of towns and 
communities, the transcription of their present Slovak names 
into the language of the minority be used. 
  6. To the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to advise European 
structures, and the Council of Europe in particular, that the 
recognition of above-standard rights for the Hungarian minority 
sets a dangerous precedent that might lead to destabilization in 
other European countries as well. 
  7. To the church authorities to ensure that religious

  8. To the NRSR to pass a law on the protection of the 
Republic, in the spirit of the "Second Memorandum." 
<H5>  To Citizens of Hungarian Nationality </H5>
  Esteemed fellow citizens of Hungarian nationality! At the 
threshold of the second year of our common republic, we appeal 
to you, in the interest of continued peaceful coexistence, not 
to yield to political pressures undermining our stability and, 
thereby, head off the creation of any social conflicts. 
  The Slovak Republic is our common homeland and belongs to 
all 
of us. Let us therefore, as citizens, seek common ground; let us 
seek the path toward unity and toward the stability and 
enhancement of our common homeland. 
  Accept this new year's message as a call for further 
peaceful 
and virtuous coexistence in the common homeland.

<F P=106> [Text of appeal issued by the Association of Towns and </F>
Villages of Velky Zitny Ostrov to local governments in southern 
Slovakia, dated 6 December 1993: "Appeal"; includes "Supporting 
Statement" issued by leaders of the Coexistence Political 
Movement and the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement] 
txt}[Text] Dear Fellow Mayors and Representatives! 
  We are contacting you regarding a vital issue! For the first 
time in its history, the Association of Csallokoz [Velky Zitny 
Ostrov] Towns and Villages is calling a national, grand meeting 
of all elected representatives, mayors, and parliamentary 
representatives of southern Slovakia. Just why did we decide to 
call a national grand meeting? 
  We did so to express our unanimous view: The government of 
this country is ruining us. It inhibits our development 
potential because it deprives us of the possibility to exercise 
rights to which individuals and communities in every 
constitutional state are entitled, and because it withholds some 
of the funds our municipalities are entitled to receive. It 
limits the exercise of our autonomous rights, and the evolution 
of autonomous local governments. The government is planning to 
implement a state administrative and regional reorganization 
over our heads, one that is akin to the one we have already 
experienced in the era of centralized state administration and 
autocracy. This would violate the principle of self-governance, 
and from our standpoint, would mean another deprivation of 
rights. 
  The political leadership of the country is spreading 
propaganda of a kind that creates social unrest, and incites 
coexisting Slovaks and Hungarians against each other. It makes 
Hungarians appear as enemies of Slovakia. It endeavors to turn 
against each other the Hungarian people of southern Slovakia and 
their parliamentary representatives elected through democratic 
processes. 
  Danger signals, which characterize our social, political, 
and 
economic situation, prompt us to call a national, grand meeting 
of the elected Hungarian representatives of this large region, 
who share our interests. 
  We are aware of the fact that, according to every 
indication, 
the highest degree of mutual tolerance exists in this large 
region spanning from Pozsony [Bratislava] to the Ukrainian 
border, where a mass of about 600,000 Hungarians lives. This is 
in contrast to the prevailing atmosphere in other parts of the 
country. There are mutual, good relations between the Hungarian 
and Slovak people who live here; they are bonded by historical 
roots and have established productive social relations and the 
basic conditions for an economy capable of evolving. We must 
reap the benefits of this valuable situation by acting on the 
basis of our common will, and this is why we jointly state: 
Based on Recommendation No. 1201 of the Council of Europe, the 
establishment of a province with special legal status, with its 
own local government and administration, is needed in areas 
where significant numbers of Hungarians reside. An area having 
such status would preserve and enrich European values that, in 
the course of the past several decades, have gradually withered 
in this region. 
  With that, we also want to state our firm demand to settle 
the legal status of the Hungarian national community in 
Slovakia, in a manner consistent with the proposed draft 
constitution prepared by the parliamentary representatives of 
the Hungarian coalition. At the same time, let us also declare 
that as a result of this settlement, the rights of Slovak people 
residing in the same area, but in a minority compared to us, 
must not be infringed upon in any respect. 
  Let us elect from among the participants of the grand 
meeting 
a 100-member committee charged with the implementation of 
resolutions adopted by the meeting. 
  We recognize the special mission of this historic meeting in 
the fact that by virtue of its positions it would unite the 
politically divided Hungarian people of Slovakia. Our jointly 
agreed-upon concepts concerning our fate would not become prey 
to partisan struggles. 
  For this reason we are calling upon all mayors, local 
government representatives, and parliamentary representatives in 
southern Slovakia, irrespective of their political and 
ideological commitments, to take part in the national grand 
meeting to be held on 8 January 1994 in Komarom [Komarno]! 
  Council of the Association ofllokoz Towns and Villages 
  Komarom, 6 December 1994 
<H5>  Supporting Statement </H5>
  A resolution was passed at the 7 December 1993 conference 
designed to streamline the leadership policies of the 
Coexistence Movement and the MKDM [Hungarian Christian 
Democratic Movement] to the effect that the two organizations 
would join forces in supporting the announcement of the 
Association of Csallokoz Towns and Villages, calling upon every 
Hungarian elected representative and mayor, as well as 
parliamentary representative in southern Slovakia, irrespective 
of party affiliation or ideological orientation, to take part in 
the Komarom national grand meeting to be held on 8 January 1994. 
  The two organizations agree with the contents of the call 
publicized by the Association of Csallokoz Towns and Villages, 
and have agreed that they would participate in the political 
preparatory work to organize the meeting in order to ensure the 
success of this national action. 
  On behalf of the Coexistence Movement: Miklos Duray, Istvan 
Harna, Miklos Feher. 
  On behalf of the MKDM: Bela Bugar, Pal Farkas, Pal Csaky.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General Anton Slimak, "interim </F>
rector" of the Liptovsky Mikulas Military Academy, by Maria 
Tolnayova in Liptovsky Mikulas; date not given: "Future Lies in 
Integration"] 
  [Excerpts] Liptovsky Mikulas--The post-November 1989 
changes and the founding of an independent Slovak Republic and, 
hence, of a new army have called forth changes in the system of 
military education as well. [passage omitted] 
  There was no other way but to transform this type of school. 
The founding of the Liptovsky Mikulas Military Academy [VVLM] 
was the first stage of this transformation. 
<H5>  What Kind of Experts Do We Need? </H5>
  This is a question of principle, Lieutenant General Engineer 
Anton Slimak, whom the minister of defense and the Slovak 
president charged with acting as the VVLM interim commander and 
rector, told us. The problem is that we know our needs--that is, 
who must be added where for the Army to be functional--only from 
today's perspective. Because the Army of the Slovak Republic 
[ASR] is facing the exacting task of transforming itself, hardly 
anyone can say today what we will require three years from now, 
for example. Yet the system of education must be at least one 
step ahead. The VVLM, which is the legal successor to the former 
VVTS [Military Technical College] in this city and to the 
Military Pedagogical College in Bratislava, educates at four 
faculties specialists for ground troops, air defense, logistics, 
and command and control of arms systems. [passage omitted] 
  The VVLM has taken over all students of higher military 
educational establishments who studied in the Czech Republic. 
They represent a full one-third of the 12,000 students who 
currently attend the VVLM. Many of them were studying in highly 
specialized fields with a small number of students, and their 
further placement was problematic. It was not possible to 
establish a chair for two or three students. The Ministry of 
Defense therefore concluded an agreement with the Ministry of 
Education and, subsequently, with individual universities, under 
which these students study according to the programs of studies 
of the relevant [nonmilitary] faculties. This also applies to 
the study of general medicine. Physicians for Army needs used to 
be trained at the Military Medical Academy at Hradec Kralove [in 
the Czech Republic]. Its students have transferred to the P.J. 
Safarik University in Kosice, and the first year of the study of 
medicine for the ASR's needs has been opened at the Medical 
School of Jesenius University in Martin. On the basis of 
experience from cooperation with these civilian schools, we will 
also reorganize studies at the VVLM. A total of 64 
specializations are at present being studied within the 
framework of the Army. This is a phenomenon that must be 
radically reassessed, says Anton Slimak. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Conditions for partially funding the building of the 
Mochovce nuclear power station by German capital should be 
specified this month. 
  This was stated yesterday [4 January] by Sergey Kozlik, 
deputy Slovak prime minister for the economy, following his 
talks with the German Ambassador in Slovakia Heike Zenker. 
  It is being considered that the overall sum of foreign 
credits for Mochovce should represent 1.5 billion German marks. 
This financial help is truly inevitable for Mochovce because, 
according to our information from this part of Slovakia, if the 
minimum funds for suppliers' survival are not safeguarded, they 
will have to suspend all work this month and leave the building 
site. This stems from the joint statement of two general 
suppliers of the Mochovce nuclear power station, Hydrostav 
Bratislava and Skoda Praha, addressed to the Slovak Government 
at the end of last year. 
  In this connection, Stanislav Katrinec interviewed Peter 
Cuntala, deputy head of the Mochovce nuclear power station, and 
Mojmir Seliga, head of the department for international 
cooperation. 
  [Begin recording] [Katrinec] Mr. Cuntala, does the Slovak 
Power Enterprise, as an investor, possess the minimum funds for 
both the main suppliers, or are they indeed leaving? 
  [Cuntala] For the time being, we do not possess them. 
According to the statement of Director Gejdos, head of Hydrostav 
in Mochovce, the decision about whether they will remain at the 
building site will be made after 10 January 1994. 
  [Katrinec] Mr. Seliga, you have about a week to do something 
in order to get this money. What are you going to do? 
  [Seliga] At the beginning I should like to say that the 
business intention for Mochovce for 1994 has been prepared, but 
it has not been discussed yet. This is what is important for us. 
This means that, for the time being, we have no money. To get 
it, we must undergo important talks at the level of the Slovak 
Ministry of the Economy and the government. 
  These talks were preceded by important talks at the Ministry 
of the Economy before Christmas, which were attended by Mr. 
Fauve, the head of foreign investments of Electricite de France, 
where the actual speeding up of the entire process was agreed 
upon. At the same time, however, I must say that, out of the 
original three members of the investors' consortium, only one 
remained--namely, Electricite de France. 
  [Katrinec] This changes the situation. However, it does not 
change the basic condition of all of the potential foreign 
investors, which is privatization. At what stage is it at the 
Mochovce nuclear power station? 
  [Seliga] The privatization project has been returned by the 
government bodies, and one has to wait for its signing so that 
we might implement the subsequent privatization steps at 
Mochovce. I should also like to say that Electricite de France 
remains the only partner to coordinate trade management in 
Mochovce. Its employees are now moving to the houses of [name 
indistinct] village. 
  [Katrinec] Is one to understand that Electricite de France 
is 
serious about the investments in Mochovce? 
  [Seliga] Yes, it may be understood that way because, in mid 
January, the director general of Electricite de France is coming 
for crucial talks with the Slovak Government, and our 
supervisory board has been preparing for them. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Today Mircea Geoana, the spokesman of the 
Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, held his weekly news 
conference. [passage omitted] 
  Answering a journalist's question, Mr. Geoana referred to 
certain aspects of Romanian-Hungarian relations: 
  [Begin Geoana recording] The statement made last week by 
Gyula Horn is well known. He said -- and I am trying to 
summarize his words -- that if the party he is leading wins the 
general elections that are to be held during this year's spring 
in Hungary and a government is set up in which Mr. Horn's party 
held the majority, that would mean a historic turn in relations 
between Romania and Hungary and, generally, between Hungary and 
its neighboring countries. We believe that the issue of the 
relations between Romania and Hungary is an issue of national 
interest and we believe that the relaunching of those ties is an 
absolutely vital need for the establishment of a stable 
situation in this region. We also believe that it is an 
absolutely necessary precondition for the two countries' 
integration within Euro-Atlantic structures and that goal is 
more important than any circumstantial political issue and 
therefore it should be in the center of attention of any 
[Hungarian] government, regardless of its political orientation. 
  I also have to say that the Mr. Horn's statement was 
received 
by us with great satisfaction, as it is quite obvious that in 
the Hungarian political life they have realized the importance 
of normalizing ties with Romania. We believe that a similar 
thing is currently happening in Romania as well. [end Geoana

<F P=106> [Interview with Odon Bitay, deputy chairman of the Social </F>
Democratic New Left-Wing Group, by NEPSZABADSAG's Bucharest 
correspondent; place and date not given: "The RMDSZ's Social 
Democratic Platform Is Being Formed"] 
  [Text] According to the reports of Hungarian newspapers in 
Romania, the Social Democratic New Left-Wing Group has been 
formed in Kolozsvar [Cluj-Napoca]. Tibor Dane is the chairman, 
Odon Bitay the deputy chairman, and Karoly Nagy is the secretary 
of the group that is a new platform of the Democratic Union of 
Hungarians in Romania [RMDSZ -- UDMR in Romanian], the reports 
say. NEPSZABADSAG's Bucharest correspondent asked Odon Bitay 
what the actual goals of the organization are. 
  [Bitay] The Social Democratic New Left-Wing Group was formed 
as an internal organization of the RMDSZ at a meeting of 
counties in Kolozsvar on 18 December 1993. Its establishment was 
justified by the fact that the general goals of the RMDSZ's 
program and the groups that have been formed as the RMDSZ's 
internal platforms ignore the vital issues of workers and 
wage-earners. We could call ourselves some kind of internal 
opposition of the RMDSZ as opposed to the sometimes extreme 
liberal ideas because we are offering an alternative regarding 
the ways to achieve the economic and social goals. It is our 
fundamental goal to represent the interest of workers, small 
entrepreneurs in towns and villages, the emerging agricultural 
paid laborers, young people, disadvantaged people, and primarily 
the unemployed and the pensioners, on a political level. 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] What are the similarities and the differences 
between the goals of your group and the RMDSZ? 
  [Bitay] We see the future in establishing a social market 
economy based on mixed ownership, and we are trying to ensure 
equal opportunities for wage-earners and manual and intellectual 
workers -- as they are the biggest social group -- both in their 
life chances and in the area of acquisition of property. We 
support the Union of Hungarian Workers in Romania, the RMDSZ 
co-organization that since May 1992 has been representing the 
economic interests of workers. We will support their political 
ideas so that we can assert the workers' interests in the 
RMDSZ's leading organizations -- mainly the Council of Federal 
Representatives -- and, through the RMDSZ's members present in 
the two houses of Parliament, in legislation. We clearly laid 
down our goals in our program that we published in June 1993 in 
the ROMANIAI MAGYAR SZO. However, as the county newspapers and 
the electronic media kept quiet about us, there was very little 
reaction to our appearance. The reactions that we did receive 
were not always positive. 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] What do you think was the reason? 
  [Bitay] The new left-wing in our group's name might be 
off-putting for many people. They interpret it as some kind of 
effort to restore the past. The lack of political culture is 
the basic reason for this, and the fact that people here are not 
familiar with the essence of the new left-wing political 
tendency although this view and ideological trend has gained 
followers and has been recognized in the West. 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] What kind of relations does your group have 
with the RMDSZ? 
  [Bitay] We adhere to the requirements of the statutes 
established at the RMDSZ's congress in Brasov. The RMDSZ's 
leadership was aware of the establishment of this group. We 
forwarded the statement from our inaugural meeting, our program 
document, and our statute to the RMDSZ's leadership. We claim 
our place in the RMDSZ's structure as a new platform. 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] What is the territorial basis of your group? 
  [Bitay] At the moment, we have local representatives in five 
counties, namely Harghita, Kovaszna [Covasna], Maros [Mures], 
Szilagy [Salaj], and Kolozs [Cluj] counties. However, we are 
only at the very beginning of our organization and we hope that 
we will also find followers in the other Transylvanian counties 
where Hungarians are living.

<F P=106> [First installment of interview with Father Georgi </F>
Gelemenov, leader of the extreme right-wing "Rebirth" 
[Vuzrazhdane] Organization and cofounder of the "United 
Bulgarian Soldiery" [Obedineno Bulgarsko Voynstvo] organization, 
by Svetlana Krustev; place and date not given: "I Advocate A 
New National Rebirth Process That Would Restore the Turks' 
Bulgarian Names"] 
  [Text] [Krusteva] Father Gelemenov, in the last elections 
you relied on the nationalist card and lost. What makes you 
think that nationalism has more of a chance of success in 
Bulgaria today? 
  [Gelemenov] We lost because we did not manage to accomplish 
our task as we should have. Many other formations existed that 
called themselves nationalist, and I have the feeling that the 
election results were forged, anyway. Since, as you say, the 
nationalist idea is fading, I created a new theory that is 
actually an old one, namely the Nazi idea. I would like to 
introduce this idea to Bulgaria, and as its promoter, I shall 
propagate the theory of moderate racism. 
  [Krusteva] What does your theory represent? 
  [Gelemenov] I am planning to publish a pamphlet on the 
subject in the near future, so that people can see it in print. 
It is a theory that divides Bulgaria's population into three 
groups, according to their ethnic origins, namely: Bulgarians 
who are the indigenous residents of the country should represent 
the first category. The Gypsies who immigrated during the 
period of the great migration should represent the second 
category, while the third category should be composed of the 
Turks who were the invaders. The second and third categories of 
people should be subject to the first category, according to my 
moderate racial theory. This is so, because, we, the white 
people in Bulgaria, are the indigenous residents of this 
country. In this respect I include another subcategory that is 
not racial, but represents a social group, intent on dividing 
the Bulgarian nation and troubling the souls of Christians. I 
am talking of the religious sects. This is actually the lowest 
category of people on my list. 
  [Krusteva] Do you realize that all your theories are in 
contradiction to the Bulgarian Constitution? 
  [Gelemenov] Yes, but it does not bother me, because the 
Bulgarian Constitution is only a bunch of papers loosely bound 
together with glue and string. On the other hand, my theory is 
based on the natural moral code, which is deeply rooted in the 
souls and hearts of the Bulgarian people and calls for such a 
racial segregation. 
  [Krusteva] You had some relations with the Union of 
Democratic Forces [SDS] in the past. Why did you not join that 
formation? 
  [Gelemenov] On 18 April 1990, when we, all the well-known 
dissidents, were supposed to gather and establish the grouping 
that should have guaranteed the country's progress.... 
  [Krusteva] You were not admitted to the conference? 
  [Gelemenov] Yes, indeed. The current president Zhelyu 
Zhelev slammed the door in front of my face, without any 
explanation. When I shook hands with him upon stepping down 
from the bus, he took my hand for one second, and then dropped 
it. It was suggested to him that he not work with me, as I 
later heard, and he is supposed to have called me a fascist. 
  [Krusteva] Who suggested to him that he should not cooperate 
with you? 
  [Gelemenov] It was that fellow Ivaylo Trifonov [one of 
Zhelev's current advisers], I think. I already had several 
interviews with Radio Free Europe [RFE]. Together with 
Khristofor Subev we founded the formation called "In Defense of 
Religious Rights, Freedom of Conscience, and Spiritual Values." 
Naturally, we separated, later on. My most important action 
was on 10 October 1989. I celebrated a requiem for the Polish 
priest Jerzy Popieluszko. Only a few people learned about it, 
but if you can find the GAZETA WYBORCZA of those days, you can 
see my picture with my hand raised in the victory sign, and 
wearing clerical robes. On that occasion RFE and BBC made a big 
fuss about me, which seems to have evoked President Zhelev's 
jealousy. 
  [Krusteva] Do you feel insulted by the term "fascist?" 
  [Gelemenov] I am not impressed. I am not a racist, this is 
a leftist doctrine that has no place in my ideology. I am a 
Nazi, which means an extreme right nationalist, and this is the 
exact meaning of the term Nazi. It is an updated, accessible 
form, aimed at introducing law and order, and discipline in our 
country, and guaranteeing employment for all Bulgarians, mainly 
for Bulgarians. 
  [Krusteva] Father Gelemenov, is all this not in 
contradiction to your religion? 
  [Gelemenov] No. Christ himself said: "I have not came to 
bring peace on earth, but the sword." When he saw the tradesmen 
who had turned the temple into a "change office," he chased them 
away with a whip. Hence, it is sometimes necessary to turn the 
other page of Christian religion, which is rather militant and 
even aggressive. The Bulgarian people were converted by force, 
as a matter of fact. 
  [Krusteva] However, God said: "You must love your neighbor." 
  [Gelemenov] I love him, but the Bulgarian is my neighbor. 
The Gypsy and the Turk are not my brothers, they are my enemies. 
  [Krusteva] Nevertheless, the Bible preaches that one should 
love one's enemies.... 
  [Gelemenov] Let us rid this divine commandment from our 
memory for a while, and turn to history instead. The priest 
Gruyo Banski is one of my favorite historical figures, a man for 
whom I have the greatest respect. I come from Banya Village, 
Panaguyrishte area, myself, a matter of fact. That man, when he 
used to take Turkish prisoners during the 19th century 
liberation war, had a peculiar method of converting them to 
Christianity, namely with bacon. Knowing that they could not 
stand pork meat, he used to stuff their mouths with a piece of 
bacon and tell them: "You were Hassan, from now on you shall be 
called Ivan." In this context, I advocate a new national 
rebirth process that would restore the Bulgarian names of Turks 
and Gypsies who have adopted Arab names. I have already 
contributed to such actions by sending a telegram to the 
headmaster of the local school in Kayaloba, Kurdzhali area, who 
dismissed the ethnic Bulgarian Ivan Stoychev and took over his 
post. I wrote to him the following letter: "The national 
rebirth process is under way, and your post should be 
immediately assigned to an ethnic Bulgarian." 
  [Krusteva] But, this is a threat. 
  [Gelemenov] Let them get a little frightened, it is only to 
our advantage. Let them be afraid of us, so as to remind them 
that we are the indigenous residents of this country. 
  [Krusteva] Have you no respect whatsoever for an 
individual's right to self-identification [as published]? 
  [Gelemenov] Whenever our national security is affected, 
there can be no question of human rights. All important local 
government functions in Bulgarian rural areas should be assigned 
to Bulgarians. 
  [Krusteva] What about your participation in the 
establishment of armed units under the "United Bulgarian 
Soldiery" formation that we already reported? 
  [Gelemenov] I am a cofounder of the formation, but the idea 
of establishing such militant units for the defense of 
Bulgaria's honor and national pride belongs to Krum Kumanov, 
chairman of the Bulgarian Fatherland Party. I had to 
participate in the establishment of the organization, because my 
ideas coincide with his. As long as the units we decided to 
establish yesterday are still unarmed, they shall act within the 
framework of the extreme rightwing "Vuzrazhdane" organization, 
namely, they will use force whenever necessary, applying methods 
of oriental martial art and other forms of physical assault. As 
far as the armed units are concerned, Mr. Kumanov expressly 
stated that we shall consult with the police forces and the 
Army, so as not to get involved with the law, which might cause 
us difficulties. 
  [Krusteva] The police do not seem very enthusiastic about 
your initiative....Do you have a sufficient number of volunteers? 
  [Gelemenov] This is something you should ask Mr. Kumanov. 
However, volunteers, ready to defend the Bulgarian citizens 
against the crimes of gangsters and Gypsy elements who are 
killing, raping, and robbing all over the place, and against 
those who are trying to split our motherland, namely the ethnic 
Turks, can be easily found. However, we should not lay the 
emphasis on the weapons of such units. In the first place, they 
should be regarded as people who evoke the respect of those who 
encroach upon discipline, and as people who are trying to 
introduce discipline in our country. 
  [TRUD editorial note] TRUD is carrying the above interview 
in 
accordance with its principle of publishing all existing 
political views on the country's situation. In this special 
case we are apologizing to all our readers with more delicate 
sensibilities.

<F P=106> [Second installment of interview with Father Georgi </F>
Gelemenov, leader of the extreme right-wing "Rebirth" 
Organization, by Svetlana Krusteva; place and date not given: 
"I Advocate a New National Rebirth Process Which Should Restore 
the Turks' Bulgarian Names"] 
  [Text] We continue the interview with Father Georgi 
Gelemenov, leader of the extreme right "Rebirth" [Vuzrazhdane] 
Organization and of the Bulgarian Christian Democratic Party 
(center) who declared himself as the restorer of Nazism in 
Bulgaria. "Gypsies and Turks are not my brothers, they are 
killing, raping, robbing, and trying to split our fatherland," 
Gelemenov said in the previous installment of his TRUD 
interview. Our editorial board is in possession of a recorded 
transcript and would like to hear the opinion of the 
Prosecutor's Office on the matter. 
  [Krusteva] Mr. Gelemenov, do you admit that some ethnic 
Bulgarians are also guilty of rape, robberies, and murders? 
  [Gelemenov] Bulgarians who are stealing, robbing, and raping 
automatically belong to the category of criminals who are 
violating the law, public order, and discipline; hence I do not 
distinguish between them and other criminals. 
  [Krusteva] Why did you choose Plovdiv for your headquarters? 
  [Gelemenov] Because the ethnic spectrum of that city is the 
most colorful. Plovdiv has the largest number of Gypsies, 
Turks, but also Armenians and Jews, whom I have nothing against, 
of course. However, the triple agglomeration, namely of 
Bulgarians, Turks, and Gypsies, prompted me to select that city. 
The United Bulgarian Soldiery is expected to establish armed 
militant units with the cooperation of the police and the Armed 
Forces. Naturally my "Rebirth" Organization is aimed at 
establishing its own, unarmed units. I do not approve of the 
use of weapons, because I do not wish to get involved with the 
law. I rely on the mass character of the units which I am 
planning to establish. I would like my people to assist the 
police in coping with the Gypsies, so that the crime rate may be 
reduced to 2 or 3 percent. I expect them to cooperate in 
protecting law, order, and discipline. 
  [Krusteva] It is strange that you do not comply with the 
Bulgarian Constitution, but are ready to cooperate with the 
police forces. 
  [Gelemenov] It is because the police force is a law 
enforcement institution in charge of introducing public order. 
The constitution is a document of a certain value, but is not as 
effective as the penal code. The constitution is not without 
flaws. It contains some pompous postulates, which, we Nazis of 
Bulgaria, do not wish to comply with, because it bans all 
organizations based on ethnic principles, and so forth. The 
constitution does not serve our purposes, on the contrary it 
restricts our freedom of action. 
  [Krusteva] Are you not afraid of conflicts involving 
bloodshed? How would the ethnic minorities react to a new 
national rebirth process? 
  [Gelemenov] Precisely as they reacted in the 1984-85 period. 
They rose against the forces of law and order in Bulgaria, and 
were immediately crushed, of course. I do not understand why 
monuments should be erected in their memory today, why prayers 
and speeches in the Turkish language should be recited for them 
-- which is in contradiction with the constitution, as a matter 
of fact. As long as they are violating the constitution, we 
should be also entitled to do so. Violence is called for in the 
purpose of introducing law and order in the country. What they 
are trying to present to us as democracy is nothing but anarchy 
and disorder. As long as the state is unwilling to apply even 
methods of force against the violators of public order, I am 
willing to organize a bunch of decent boys who shall introduce 
law and order all over the country, and to become their leader. 
  [Krusteva] Do you think that anyone would support you? 
  [Gelemenov] What do you mean support me?! Young people are 
already following me everywhere, people are calling me from all 
parts of the country announcing their eagerness to work with me. 
I am expecting the 30 boys, who are currently trying to 
introduce law and order in the Burgas area, to call on me. I 
could be useful to them with funds for gasoline. 
  [Krusteva] Do you have any political ambitions? 
  [Gelemenov] The whole thing is actually the rudiments of a 
party which we intend to register after the New Year and which 
will be called the Nationalist Socialist Vuzrazhdane Party. I 
am convinced that National Socialism is the only idea capable of 
guaranteeing Bulgaria's progress. 
  [Krusteva] It is a theory which was rejected and condemned 
by the whole world, Mr. Gelemenov. 
  [Gelemenov] This does not frighten me. If we should accept 
that history is developing in the form of a spiral, I am 
convinced that the idea of national socialism is being revived. 
I am not the first one to adopt it for the sake of helping my 
country. The idea is not dead, it is acquiring new roots. This 
is precisely the right moment for its development in Bulgaria. 
  [Krusteva] I understood that you felt insulted by being 
called the "Bulgarian Zhirinovskiy." Why? 
  [Gelemenov] Prior to Zhirinovskiy's arrival in our country, 
I was willing to meet him, in a way. However, as soon as he 
stepped onto Bulgarian soil, he started talking such nonsense, 
that I immediately unmasked him as the great Russian clown who 
came here to spread unrest and provoke internal conflicts. 
Speaking about the annexation of Mizia, Thracia, and Macedonia 
to Bulgaria, he forgot to mention Dobrudzha. The idea of 
annexation is good, but it should be promoted through diplomatic 
channels. I am convinced that Zhirinovskiy is a paid "agent 
provocateur" who was sent on a performing tour. He is a CIA 
agent [as published] and his purpose is to provoke bloodshed and 
armed clashes in the Balkan peninsula. I insist that Mr. 
Tatarchev, the chief prosecutor, should immediately expel 
Zhirinovskiy from Bulgaria, that he should be fined at the 
border, and should no longer be permitted to step on our 
territory. 
  [Krusteva] Like yourself, Zhirinovskiy does not like the 
president. Why did you declare Dr. Zhelev as an accomplice of 
crimes committed in our country? 
  [Gelemenov] With the moratorium on capital punishment which 
he issued, he acted as an accomplice of bloody murders, chiefly 
committed against Bulgarians, because the criminals are no 
longer afraid. I approve Zhirinovskiy's idea that the president 
should be replaced, but this is none of his business. It is an 
internal Bulgarian affair. 
  [Krusteva] However, you are expecting some financial support 
from Russia for your "United Bulgarian Soldiery." Whom exactly, 
are you relying upon? 
  [Gelemenov] I am expecting financial aid from the 
organization called "Russian National Unity" and from the 
Slavonic Assembly. Being the cofounder of a bank in Russia with 
capital investments amounting to 10 million rubles, this is 
where I am expecting the resources to come from, but it will not 
be today or tomorrow. It is an organization headed by Aleksandr 
Barkashov, whose whereabouts are unknown today, and who was 
actually backed by Rutskoy. Considering that Rutskoy was 
prevented from running for the elections, the roving mountebank 
Zhirinovskiy exploited his votes. According to my own 
information, seven of my boys, I mean our boys, were killed in 
the attack against Ostankino. This was actually Yeltsin's fault. 
  [Krusteva] Has anybody told you that you are mad? 
  [Gelemenov] Everyone is more or less mad, because no 
criteria exist for a normal state of mind. I do not consider 
myself mad, because I would not have obtained a certificate of 
mental sanity when I got married. I now intend to purchase a 
license to carry firearms, hence I can hardly be considered mad. 
I think that I am a normal Bulgarian citizen who is planning to 
lead the country into the open space. Bulgaria's situation 
could be improved on the basis of a simple political scheme -- 
without a parliament and without a government. A council of 
ministers, subordinate to a strong personality, would be 
competent enough to rule the country. 
  [Krusteva] You are talking about a strong hand, one-man 
power, and so forth, is that so? 
  [Gelemenov] A very strong hand, an iron-strong hand, is 
required, as a matter of fact. The Bulgarian people, just like 
the Russian people, are used to it. 
  [Krusteva] What do you think about Adolf Hitler? 
  [Gelemenov] He was the man who helped the Germans to regain 
their self-confidence, who showed the common German citizen that 
he is the master of this earth. He fully eradicated crime, he 
did away with unemployment. His mistake was to wage a war 
against Poland and Russia. He was a brilliant politician, but 
an evil man. Nevertheless, his economic methods and those of his 
supporters could be successfully applied in contemporary 
Bulgaria. We could also work hard if someone would guide us and 
show us how to do it.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Stoyan Tsvetkov: "Racist and Gypsies"] </F>
  [Text] Pretenders of Hitler and Mussolini's dark glory 
have appeared in Bulgaria. 
  The extravagant Father Georgi Gelemenov, leader of one of 
the 
dozens of phantom parties who owes his popularity only to his 
scandalous statements and unexpected political turns, has 
declared a war on the Gypsies. 
  Naturally, the Gypsies also declared a war on the 
racist-Christian Democrat. Ethnic tension in Plovdiv and other 
cities is increasing. Without underestimating the power of the 
authorities or overestimating the possibilities of the 
"skinheads," there is no guarantee that bloody ethnic clashes 
will not take place in Bulgaria in 1994. 
  There is, however, two sides to the coin. By their 
inactivity in anything related to resolving the Gypsies' social 
problems, the state institutions are facilitating the growth of 
the crime rate among them and the emergence of racist moods 
among a part of the Bulgarian society. This is a fertile soil 
for the growth of political adventurists of the ilk of the 
aforementioned priest. 
  One way or another, Bulgaria is not immune to the xenophobia 
virus. This allows other interested groups to implement their 
political ambitions under the noble slogan of fighting against 
chauvinism and racism.

  [Text] On 5 January Zhan Videnov, leader of the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party [BSP], came to 134 Rakovski Street [headquarters 
of the Union of Democratic Forces, SDS], where he met Filip 
Dimitrov, chairman of the SDS National Coordinating Council. 
The meeting took place at the insistence of the BSP. After the 
meeting the two leaders made statements on the more important 
aspects of their meeting. First the host, Filip Dimitrov: 
  [Begin Dimitrov recording] The first topic we discussed was 
the issue of the parliamentary order and the risks involved in 
violating this order if the parliament will be paralyzed until 
new elections take place. This could be a period of time during 
which Bulgaria would have a caretaker cabinet. It is well-known 
that the SDS submitted a proposal on amending the Constitution 
in this aspect. 
  We also discussed the issue of the Supreme Judicial Council. 
The position of the SDS on this matter is very clear. We think 
that the BSP position on this matter is anticonstitutional, and 
I explained this to Mr. Videnov. 
  The third issue he invoked was related to the differences of 
the two major political forces in anything related to the matter 
of municipal by-elections. The possibility of eliminating the 
differences was discussed. We think that not allowing parties 
that are not represented in the parliament, to participate in 
those elections is an illegal act. However, we will think in 
the future about the specific form of resolving this problem. 
  Generally, I would say that the visit was an indication of 
the problems that are discussed or that exist in the BSP, and I 
think that the SDS could not be expected to get involved in 
those problems. [end recording] 
  BSP leader Zhan Videnov said that he is satisfied with the 
meeting because the conversation clarified the positions of the 
two most important political forces in Bulgarian public life, 
and this according to him means regulating political life, 
imbuing it with a predictable and normal character. This is 
what Zhan Videnov said: 
  [Begin Videnov recording] We discussed the necessity of 
guaranteeing the functioning of the parliament and the 
developments of the political life of the country, regardless of 
the shortcomings of the constitutional and legal arrangements. 
We also discussed the necessity of eliminating the existing 
normative and judicial obstacles that prevent the main political 
forces from fully participating in municipal by-elections. 
  We made our proposals in this sphere and clarified our 
positions. Relevant information was exchanged between the main 
political organs of the two parties. We do not plan new 
meetings, but perhaps specific future parliamentary and 
political actions will emerge as a result of our meeting today. 
[end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Mitko Bozhkov] </F>
  [Text] Today the authorities are following a double 
standard: They forbid political manifestations by Gypsies, 
Turks, Vlakhs, and Macedonians, while they permit the DPS 
[Movement for Rights and Freedoms] and a number of Christian 
parties -- the United Christian Democratic Center, Christian 
Agrarian Party, Christian Democratic Union, Christian Republican 
Party, and others -- to operate in contravention of the 
Constitution. The Sofia Helsinki Watch organization made this 
assertion in its review of the state of human rights in Bulgaria 
during 1993. 
  The association considers that the Constitutional Court 
should be consulted again for a ruling on how far the DPS 
conforms to the Constitution. At the last DPS national 
conference Ahmed Dogan declared that the movement is "a party on 
an ethnic basis," which is forbidden by the Constitution. 
  The association points out that at present the courts refuse 
to register parties on an ethnic and religious basis. 
  The Sofia Helsinki Watch considers that the Political 
Parties 
Act is very liberal. The absence of any meaningful lower limit 
for the number of members in a party permits the existence of 
dozens of citizens' associations that engage political activity 
in theory, but in practice mainly exist to exploit the 
privileges of duty-free imports.

  [Text] Ljubljana, Jan 5 (AFP) -- International experts 
find no "critical failings" at the Krsko nuclear power station 
in Slovenia, but say it needs to be made safer, environment 
minister Miha Jazbinsek said on Wednesday. 
  The government presented reports by three international 
commissions asked to check out the safety of the plant, and 
Jazbinsek said they had "found no critical shortcoming that 
would justify halting the nuclear plant." One of the commissions 
was from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the second from 
the International Commission for Independent Safety Analysis, 
and the third from the European Commission in Brussels (the 
executive arm of the European Community). 
  Jazbinsek noted that the reports acknowledged that there 
were 
"considerable financial problems" in upgrading the plant's 
safety. 
  The power station, 30 kms (19 miles) from the Croatian 
capital of Zagreb, was built by the U.S. firm Westinghouse and 
went into operation in 1984. Its capacity is 632 MW, and it 
sends half of its output to Slovenia and the other half to 
Croatia. 
  Slovenia has criticized Croatia for irregular contributions 
to operating costs and its refusal to store part of the nuclear 
waste. 
  As to improved safety, the experts point particularly to 
fire 
protection, replacing steam generators, and seismic dangers in 
the area.

  [Text] Ljubljana, Jan 5 (AFP) -- Slovenia suffered a trade 
deficit of 304 million dollars for the first 11 months of 1993 
due to a sharp drop in exports and a small rise in imports, the 
Economics Ministry announced on Wednesday. 
  Exports amounted to 5.5 billion dollars for the period, off 
10.9 percent from the same period in 1992, while imports were 
set at 5.8 billion dollars, up 3.9 percent. 
  Economic Relations Minister Davorin Kracun said that despite 
the trade deficit, Slovenia's foreign exchange reserves had 
increased by around 300 million dollars over the period, to 
almost 1.5 billion dollars at present.

<F P=106> [Report by Hajnalka Cseke, Tamas Dobos, Anita Elo, Laszlo </F>
Meszleny, Gabor Moricz, Gabriel Oszy-Toth, Lilla Rist, and Noemi 
Sumegi: "What Results Are Expected at Next Year's Elections?"] 
  [Text] The big parties generally expect better results in 
the spring of 1994 than they achieved at the last elections. 
The small parties and the recently formed ones would be happy 
to get into Parliament. They are all aware that their 
self-confidence, and their assertion that a coalition capable of 
governing cannot be formed without them, can bring extra votes 
for them. Based on their surveys, the Gallup or the Szonda 
Ipsos [public opinion poll companies] would probably contest 
many forecasts. Although who knows.... Many things can change 
in four or five months in politics, the popularity of certain 
parties can either increase or decline. After Christmas and 
before New Year when, leaving the daily political struggle 
behind, the party leaders have more time to look into the 
future, this is how they see their and our chances. 
<H3>  Laszlo Kover, parliamentary group leader of the Federation 
of Young Democrats [FIDESZ]: We Are Able To Defeat the 
Socialists </H3>
  "I would by no means like to express or predict the FIDESZ's 
chances in percentages. One reason is that I would not like to 
reduce our chances by talking about them, and the other is that 
Hungarian domestic political life seems to be very pliable just 
now. However, in my view, the contest will be between the 
Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the FIDESZ. I hope that we 
will come out from this as winners. As far as I can see, at the 
moment, we are the only ones who will be able defeat the 
socialists. 
  "It does not seem like a very daring prediction that none of 
the political factors on the three poles, namely the MSZP on one 
side, the three parties of the current government coalition on 
the other, and the "group" of the FIDESZ and the Alliance of 
Free Democrats [SZDSZ] on the third, will on its own be able to 
gain absolute majority. Therefore, two out of the three 
tendencies will -- at least partially -- work together to form a 
government majority. 
  "It does not seem likely that the forces outside Parliament 
will gain much strength and that any of them will turn into a 
significant political factor as a result of some landslide-like 
change. However, in my view, the voting base of the coalition 
has not continued to decrease for a long time as shown by the 
results of public opinion polls." 
<H3>  Imre Szekeres, deputy chairman and campaign chief of the 
MSZP: We Will Be a Significant Force in Political Life </H3>
  "I first of all want the country to get as far as the 
elections in order and without major problems. 
  "It is a decisive factor that all political forces should 
show more self-moderation in the economy and in politics. 
Another one is that programs and people, rather than passions, 
should contend each other at the elections because otherwise we 
will not be able to do anything with each other or with any kind 
of election results. Third: I expect a government that will be 
able to keep this country running and can show some kind of 
results in the future. 
  "I think that the MSZP will reach around 25 percent at the 
elections and will thus remain a significant force in Hungarian 
political life; we will be able to influence the country's life. 
  "Looking at it from the end of 1993, it cannot yet be 
decided 
who the coalition partners might be. We can only answer this 
after the elections, and I am not saying this for tactical 
reasons. First of all, we have to know how much support the 
various parties have because in a parliamentary democracy, 
majority has to be shown. In Hungary, we cannot set up a 
government by coming together and distributing the ministerial 
and state secretarial positions and then wait and see what 
happens. 
  "However, I can now say with whom I cannot foresee governing 
together: These are the current government parties. I am not 
saying this for ideological reasons: These parties have 
governed very unsuccessfully and the citizens will vote for us 
-- if they will -- to prevent this government from staying in 
office." 
<H3>  Zoltan Kiraly, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of 
Hungary [MSZDP]: Getting Into Parliament Is a Realistic Goal 
for Us </H3>
  Many people think that, with this historic name, it was 
difficult for you not to get into Parliament three years ago. 
At that time, the MSZDP produced a fine example of a failed 
election campaign. In view of the past three years, how do you 
see your party's election chances, we asked Zoltan Kiraly. 
  "The parliamentary parties have a large advantage over us. 
Except for the last few months, the MSZDP's past three and a 
half years have been characterized by internal troubles while 
our rivals left us far behind. While the other parties already 
have complete lists, we are working on the criteria for 
selecting candidates. However, the party's 103-year history is a 
big advantage. All in all, I think that getting into Parliament 
can be a realistic goal for our party. 
  "Unfortunately, our party is in a very bad financial 
situation. Our sympathizers are helping us 'on credit.' We will 
pay if we get into Parliament. We actually inherited 10 million 
forints debt and the state support is very small, we cannot use 
much of it for the campaign. From the western parties, we can 
only expect moral and professional support in formulating our 
program and during the campaign. 
  "According to the public opinion polls, the MSZP and the 
FIDESZ have a considerable chance to win the elections. 
However, we cannot yet know how the votes will reflect the fact 
that people are turning away from the FIDESZ. The Christian 
Democratic People's Party [KDNP] will become stronger. The 
socialists, the FIDESZ, the KDNP, and the SZDSZ will play a 
determining role in the new Parliament. 
  "At least eight parties will be present in Parliament. I can 
see a chance for the Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP], 
the smallholders, the Republic Party, and perhaps the Agrarian 
Federation to get seats. Naturally, I hope that the social 
democrats will also be there." 

<H3>    Karoly Herenyi, spokesman for the Hungarian Democratic 
Forum [MDF]: No Government Can Be Formed Without the Forum in 
1994, Either </H3>
  MAGYAR NEMZET interviewed Karoly Herenyi on the MDF's 
election chances in 1994. 
  "The MDF will continue to play a determining role in 
Hungarian political life after the 1994 elections. It is 
impossible to form a government without the MDF. I believe that 
we will repeat our election results as a percentage proportion, 
at least as far as the position is concerned, we might not do 
this as regards the number of mandates. 
  "We can talk about coalition issues after we know our 
election results. We can mainly work together with our natural 
allies, the KDNP and the smallholders party that will hopefully 
continue to pull itself together, and we hope that it will have 
much better results than in 1990. Under no circumstances will 
we enter into a coalition with the SZDSZ or the MSZP. We do not 
have any contacts with the MIEP and the events of the last weeks 
confirm that there is decreasing chance for any kind of 
cooperation with this party. I am thinking of their statements 
in the days of mourning, including the caption under the photo 
on the front page of the MAGYAR FORUM on 16 December. 
  "In my view, the election results will not directly be 
influenced by the unfortunate death of the former prime minister 
Jozsef Antall because the MDF will continue his political line 
in the future, too." 
<H3>  Laszlo Surjan, chairman of the KDNP: Our Candidates Are 
Examined </H3>
  The KDNP expects 15 to 25 percent of the votes at the 1994 
elections. According to Laszlo Surjan, the KDNP will come up 
with a more impressive and younger list of candidates compared 
to 1990. All candidates have to go through a compulsory 
examination in the party and the list of candidates will only be 
made public after this. As regards the possible coalitions, 
Surjan is cautious because at least four parties have the chance 
to gain 15 to 20 percent of the votes and, in this case, in the 
interest of governability, compromises have to be made for which 
cooperation among the four forces might be necessary. It is 
only the MSZP that cannot be considered as an ally out of the 
parliamentary parties. Surjan cannot exclude the possibility but 
does not intend to take away votes from the MDF and he wants to 
remain especially correct with the MDF. The KDNP expects that, 
because of the SZDSZ's coming closer to the MSZP, a number of 
former SZDSZ sympathizers will join the KDNP's voting base. In 
1990, the KDNP was unable to set up a list in five counties 
because of the lack of individual candidates, but it will have 
candidates in all voting districts in 1994. 
  While its predecessor, Brankovics's Democratic People's 
Party, had its main stronghold in the Transdanubia, today the 
KDNP's biggest membership is in Nograd, Borsod, and 
Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg counties. The KDNP expects to increase 
the number of its mandates mainly from northern Hungary. In 
1990, the KDNP was not a significant force in 
Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg county but, as a result of steady 
organizational work, this is now one of their strongest 
districts. Many of the individual candidates are leaders and 
activists of civic organizations, and many of them have 
experience in local affairs. Sandor Gergely, chairman of the 
National Federation of Savings Cooperatives; Laszlo Nogradi, 
leader of the Hungarian Entrepreneurs' Chamber; Istvan Mikola, 
chairman of the Hospital Federation; and Gabor Jobbagy, one of 
the leading figures of the Embryo Protection Movement, will run 
for the KDNP. 
<H3>  Geza Gyimothy, general secretary of Jozsef Torgyan's 
Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP]: We Feel We Are Strong </H3>
  Bearing in mind the slogan of "God, Homeland, and Family," 
the Independent Smallholders, Agricultural Workers, and Citizens 
Party with its 60,000 membership is the country's strongest 
party; therefore, it has a reason to be optimistic about the 
1994 elections, Geza Gyimothy told MAGYAR NEMZET. He said that 
they would run a candidate in all 176 parliamentary electoral 
districts, and they would mainly like to gain the trust of their 
compatriots who have Christian and national sentiments. Before 
the first round, they will not enter into an election alliance 
with other parties, and they will conduct their election 
campaign in coordination with the some 20 organizations that are 
part of the Christian National Unity [Kereszteny Nemzeti 
Osszefogas]. 
  "We feel that the MDF has lost the trust of the citizens but 
there is a strata with Christian national sentiments which, four 
years ago, gave 62 percent of the votes on the parliamentary 
coalition deputies. We are mainly expecting their votes," 
Gyimothy said. 
  According to Gyimothy, they have a realistic chance to get 
20 
to 25 percent of the votes. The smallholders had 12 percent of 
the votes at the last elections. 
  "As our party has become stronger by now, we have reason to 
hope that we will have better election results in 1994," 
Gyimothy thought. 
<H3>  Ivan Peto, chairman of the SZDSZ: Even Fewer Mandates Might 
Be Enough for Victory </H3>
  "Compared to the 1990 elections, the only change that I 
expect is that fewer mandates might be enough for an election 
victory. It is our, just as every other party's, 'obligation' 
to trust that we, namely the SZDSZ, will come up as winners. I 
can see a good chance for this. 
  "It is difficult to answer the question whether the 
representatives of the conservative, the socialist, or the 
liberal parties will be able to form a government on their own. 
However, I do not think it is likely that the liberal parties 
and their election allies will be able to gain a strong 
governmental majority." 
  "As far as I can see, no breakthrough can be expected in 
the issue of which parties gain a seat in Parliament. As 
opposed to the smaller organizations, it is the current 
parliamentary parties that have a chance to get into Parliament 
again. However, the MSZP will probably have better results at 
the 1994 elections than it did in 1990." 
<H3>  Janos Palotas, chairman of the Republic Party: We Do Not 
Ally Ourselves With Extremists </H3>
  Recently, the Republic Party has significantly decreased the 
gap between itself and the parliamentary parties. In some 100 
of the 176 electoral districts, it would already now be able to 
have a candidate. They achieved all this in barely one year of 
organizational work. What does Janos Palotas predict about the 
results of the 1994 elections? 
  "In recent times, a relatively stable political image has 
been formed of the six parliamentary parties. This can be 
changed by an exceptionally good performance, another 1 or 2 
percent can be gained but much more difference cannot be 
expected. In my estimation, the MSZP will gain the largest 
proportion of votes, some 22 to 23 percent. The chances of the 
current government parties are much worse than this. 
  "It is much harder to predict the chances of the Republic 
Party, it has many tasks whose good solution can significantly 
influence the election results. It is a big challenge for us 
whether we can run in all 176 voting districts. If we manage to 
achieve this then we can even approach the peaks, otherwise we 
will gain many fewer votes. Therefore, the election result of 
the Republic Party can be between 11 to 12 percent or 25 to 27 
percent. Whichever becomes reality, we will have to see it as a 
success because we will be in Parliament. However, our final 
goal can only be for our party to be a leading force of the 
future government coalition. 
  "If we win, the Agrarian Federation, the SZDSZ, FIDESZ, or 
the KDNP can be our coalition partners. We would not enter into 
an alliance with the MDF or any extremist political forces, 
namely the MIEP, the Market Party, or the Workers' Party. The 
FKGP cannot be taken into consideration because, in our view, 
politically they are not sufficiently serious. The MSZDP is 
struggling with similar problems at the moment but it has 
progressive signs. If we do not win the elections then the 
program of the leading party will decide whether we can work 
together with it." 
<H3>  Zoltan Biro, co-chairman of the National Democratic 
Federation [NDSZ]: We Can Equal the Challenge </H3>
  The NDSZ would like to occupy the position of national 
center 
in the Hungarian political structure. What chances does the 
party have to achieve this? Zoltan Biro gives the answer. 
  "As opposed to the parliamentary parties that are also well 
endowed with financial resources, the NDSZ starts from a 
disadvantageous position. In spite of this, our position is 
encouraging because it seems that we will be able to meet the 
challenge at the elections. I am certain that we will get into 
Parliament. I hope for a parliamentary position for the NDSZ 
from which it will indeed be able to have a say in forming 
Hungarian politics. 
  "In my view, the unification of the social democrats will 
not 
significantly influence our chances. However, I believe that an 
honest social democratic party will become strong within 10 
years in this country; it may become one of the important 
political forces, and might even be our ally in the future. 
However, at the moment, there is a big difference between our 
programs and political directions. The history of Hungary's 
social democratic parties -- including the events of the past 
years -- show that they cannot organize themselves on a national 
basis to the extent we consider necessary. 
  "The KDNP and the MSZP will certainly gain strength but this 
will not be of decisive proportions. After the elections, I 
would like a coalition in which the center forces that are close 
to each other -- either to the right or to the left -- work 
together. In this coalition, the NDSZ will certainly be among 
the influential parties. With the Agrarian Federation, for 
example, we can only work together if the programs and political 
directions can be well coordinated, and this also applies to 
other parties. Before the elections, rather than among the 
parties, we are seeking allies among the civic organizations 
that have closer links with society."

<F P=106> [Correspondent's report: "We Do Not Shoot at Clay Pigeons </F>
-- Party Views on Viktor Orban's Coalition Model"] 
  [Text] Viktor Orban, chairman of the Federation of Young 
Democrats [FIDESZ], considers a coalition of the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum [MDF], the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], 
the FIDESZ, and the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] 
possible after the elections. In Kossuth Radio's Late Evening 
Chronicle on 2 January, Orban added that, although this is only 
an "experiment of thoughts" without knowing the number of 
mandates, it is a politically feasible version. Especially 
because many factors are pushing events in this direction. 
  According to Orban, his party would not take part in a 
coalition that is organized on the basis of the Hungarian 
Socialist Party's [MSZP] program, and would not happily 
participate in one that is guided by the MDF's economic program. 
  Reacting to Orban's statement that a FIDESZ-MDF-SZDSZ-KDNP 
big coalition could be established after the 1994 elections, 
Attila Zsigmond, spokesman for the MDF's parliamentary group, 
said that many more hypotheses and coalition versions will be 
mentioned in the coming months. Therefore, until the first 
round of the elections is over, we need not attribute much 
significance to this suggestion, either, and he added that "we 
do not wish to fire at clay pigeons." 
  As a matter of fact, six weeks ago, MDF Administrative 
Chairman Sandor Lezsak said that the FIDESZ's anti-church 
attitude makes it completely unsuitable for the MDF to consider 
a coalition with it. 
  "The KDNP will not make any written or verbal agreements or 
contracts, be it secret or open, with anyone before the 
elections, and it is too early to talk about events that will 
come after," Vaszlo Varga, deputy chairman of the KDNP said in 
reply to our correspondent's question. "We pay special 
attention to ensuring that the KDNP participates independently 
in the elections. It is our firm view that we can only decide 
with whom we enter a coalition after the election results and 
the programs are known. Any other news to the contrary is a 
figment of imagination," Varga said. 
  SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Peto is rather fed up with the coalition 
speculations. In his view, some people are constantly opening 
and closing doors in the rather drafty domestic political life 
-- however, these approaches and alienations cannot really be 
interpreted until the country is past at least the first round 
of the elections. 
  As a matter of fact, the FIDESZ chairman has many times said 
that, in his view, a liberal bloc would be the optimal solution, 
which means that he would not be very happy to form a coalition 
with the MDF. Then he said that they are also open toward the 
KDNP and the MDF but did not completely rule out cooperation 
with the MSZP, either -- although it is also true that, in the 
meantime, he warned the SZDSZ that should it join ranks with the 
possibly victorious socialists after the elections, it would 
turn into a small MSZP. "When we -- or others -- would be 
threatened by turning into a small or big Christian or 
nationalist party, Orban could not exactly say but I hope that 
we will be able to avert the lurking danger even without his 
advice," Peto said. 
  According to MSZP member Laszlo Kovacs, it is difficult to 
make out what the FIDESZ chairman is up to. "A few weeks ago 
when, in an interview with a German newspaper, [then interior 
minister] Peter Boross did not exclude the possibility of an 
MDF-FIDESZ coalition, Orban was talking about provocation." 
  "I believe that a party first has to be successful at the 
elections, has to win them, and only then is it worth deciding 
about the coalition partners," Kovacs continued. "In my view, 
the FIDESZ is doing exactly the opposite. It is probably trying 
to compensate for its continuously decreasing popularity in 
recent months by distancing itself from the MSZP." 
  Kovacs thought it possible that the MSZP might be forced 
into 
opposition even if it wins the elections. Should this happen, 
in his view, it will mean that the parliamentary parties do not 
accept the will of the electors, namely that the majority would 
like to see the representatives of the winning party in 
government.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Competing With the Parties That </F>
`Boast About Being Hungarian'--on Tuesday's Function Organized 
by the Democratic Association of Hungarians in Vojvodina"] 
  [Text] At Tuesday evening's Nyitott Ajto [Open Door] 
program the audience paid its respects to the memory of 
Hungarian head of government Jozsef Antall by standing silently 
for one minute. This was followed by VMDK [Democratic Community 
of Vojvodina Hungarians--DZVM in Serbo-Croatian] Vice Chairman 
Karoly Dudas reminiscing about the 1991 meeting of Hungarian 
head of government Antall and Yugoslav head of government 
Markovic in Szabadka [Subotica]. Dudas pointed out the great 
loss Antall's death meant to the Hungarian people, and expressed 
hope that in the person of head of government-designate Peter 
Boross, slated to take Antall's place, the Hungarian people 
would have someone equally supportive of the VMDK endeavors. 
Thereafter Dr. Csaba Sepsey, the chairman of the VMDK Szabadka 
organization, reported on the contents of a letter by Andras 
Agoston to the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum] dispatched a few 
hours after Antall's death. This was followed by a debate over 
election preparations. On Saturday, the VMDK Board also analyzed 
the related activities that have taken place thus far. Since the 
VMDK election campaign concentrates on visiting the various 
areas, the first visits by people from the Szabadka organization 
were paid to Hungarian-inhabited villages in the Banat region 
last week (including Kisorosz, Toba, Torda, Magyarcsernye [Nova 
Crnja], and Debelyacsan). They were received with great 
enthusiasm. On this occasion, too, Dr. Csaba Sepsey did not fail 
to criticize MAGYAR SZO, asserting that its mast head should 
state "The daily newspaper of the Democratic Reform Party" 
instead of saying that it is the daily newspaper reflecting the 
democratic public opinion. He said this because voters belonging 
to the VMDK--Hungarian readers--were unable to learn from the 
newspaper about the 20-25 [as published] VMDK grand meeting last 
week, but instead could read much more about presentations made 
by the Vojvodina Democratic Coalition. 
  "Parties supportive of Great Serb nationalism agree in one 
respect: Hungarians must be divided. For this reason they 
nominate Hungarians to winning slots on their slates," Dr. Csaba 
Sepsey said. Karoly Dudas claimed that the real opponent of the 
VMDK in the elections is not going to be Milosevic's Socialist 
Party, but parties and coalitions which profess to be 
democratic, and which "boast about being Hungarian." At this 
meeting, too, Dr. Tibor Varady was the subject of repeated 
criticism; in last year's elections he headed the VDRP's 
[Democratic Reform Party of Vojvodina] slate.

  [Text] Zagreb, 5 Jan (TANJUG) -- A special unit of the 
Muslim Army commanded by Bakir Izetbegovic, son of Alija 
Izetbegovic, is responsible for the murder of Jusuf Juka 
Prazina, VJESNIK daily of Zagreb writes today. Citing 
well-informed sources, the Zagreb daily blames the operation on 
Delta, a five-member Muslim commando unit commanded by Ismet 
Bajramovic. 
  According to VJESNIK, three Palestinians and members of a 
pro-Syrian organization monitored Juka's movements for several 
weeks. One of them introduced himself as an arms dealer and took 
Juka to a parking lot near the Liege-Aachen road where he was 
killed. 
  "The liquidation of Juka Prazina was financed by the son of 
Alija Izetbegovic, Bakir, who left Sarajevo six months ago," 
VJESNIK says in its unsigned article. 
  According to the Zagreb daily, Bakir Izetbegovic "frequently 
travels between Brussels, Paris, Frankfurt, Baghdad, Tehran, and 
Ankara, using Pakistani and Iraqi passports." It is believed 
that Bakir Izetbegovic was in Belgium at the time of the 
assassination. 
  VJESNIK goes on to say that "Hasan Cengic, responsible for 
army logistics in the Sarajevo government, was directly involved 
in the assassination of Juka Prazina." 
  "Immediately after the assassination, those responsible left 
for Cairo and Khartoum via Brussels and Paris and Hasan Cengic 
left for Islamabad using a false Pakistani passport," VJESNIK 
writes.

  [Text] Sarajevo, Jan 5 (AFP) -- UN Protection Force 
[UNPROFOR] commander General Francis Briquemont, who is leaving 
the job earlier than expected, has not been forced out but asked 
to quit because he is tired, UNPROFOR spokesmen said Wednesday. 
  The Belgian general's departure "is absolutely not linked 
with any disciplinary measure," said UNPROFOR's Sarajevo sector 
spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Guy de Battista. 
  UNPROFOR spokesman Major Idesbald van Biesebroeck said 
Briquemont would leave Sarajevo at the end of January. "He is 
tired. I can understand his feeling of tiredness, because it's 
quite clear that he is not so young anymore. 
  "After seven months of this difficult mission he should be 
tired," he told a press conference. 
  De Battista added: "General Briquemont's return is happening 
under normal conditions and at his request," describing as 
"completely unfounded" rumours about the reasons for 
Briquemont's departure. 
  Van Biesebroeck said Briquemont had asked to leave via the 
normal channels. "He asked his minister of defense, who goes to 
the minister of foreign affairs who goes to secretary general. 
It is an ordinary diplomatic procedure," he said. 
  Belgian Defence Minister Leo Delcroix confirmed on Tuesday 
that Briquemont was leaving ahead of his mandate, which was due 
to last until July. Meanwhile the British Defence Ministry said 
Wednesday that British General Michael Rose will replace 
Briquemont. Rose is currently British Army chief of staff.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1400 GMT on 6 January carries in 
its regular 35-minute newscast three reports on fighting in the 
republic. 
  The studio announcer reads a report by the 1st Corps 
information service and says that "the Chetniks unscrupulously 
continue to shell the city and the defense lines. From their 
well-known strongholds on the hills surrounding the city, they 
are pounding Zuc and the Jewish Cemetery with shells of the 
heaviest caliber. In the course of the day, the enemy infantry 
attempted to break through our defense lines in the vicinity of 
the Jewish Cemetery, but they met with the firm resistance of 
the defenders and retreated to their initial positions. The 
Chetniks have been observed bringing in reinforcements of 
manpower and equipment to Grbavica, Lukavica, Nedzarici, and 
Azici." 
  Olovo correspondent Velid Djindo reports that "the mortars 
from (?Bijelis) and (?Silajici) have been joined by howitzers 
from Kotakov Han, which at the time this report is being filed, 
around 1408 [1308 GMT], [words indistinct] the defense lines 
from Krusevo to Musici. In the last few days, the aggressor has 
been hastily regrouping his forces on the Olovo and Vares 
fronts. The concentration of enemy forces that began yesterday 
continued today on the Ajdarovici-Krivajici route. The 
offensive of the joint aggressors has entered its third month 
with constant enemy long-range artillery activity against 
civilian targets and our defenders' positions. The defense 
lines are stable." 
  The studio announcer says that "some time after 1100 Galeb 
enemy planes overflew the Tesanj, Teslic, Maglaj, and Doboj 
regions, and shelled a part of the Doboj free territory." Doboj 
correspondent Mirudin Aldobasic says that "owing to this, an air 
alert was sounded, while all antiaircraft units in the 7-South 
Operative Group zone of responsibility are on alert."

  [Text] Bratunac, Zvornik, 6 Jan (TANJUG) -- Throughout 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croats have been seeking military 
assistance from the Serbs, TANJUG learned today from 
high-ranking circles of the army of the Srpska republic [VSR]. 
The same sources note that units of the regular Croatian Army 
and the Croatian Defense Council have for days been engaged in 
combat activities against the Serb side, especially in the 
region of Posavina. 
  In reference to Muslim-Croat clashes, the same sources 
insist 
that the Serb side has not and will not interfere in the 
months-long fierce clashes between former allies. 
  The same source also drew attention to an increase in the 
number of helicopter flights to the Muslim enclaves of Zepa and 
Srebrenica by the so-called army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, despite 
the existing ban. 
  As stressed by the Srpska army sources, the UN Protection 
Forces [UNPROFOR] Command is well aware of this, especially as 
blue helmet units are deployed in these enclaves. The Serb side 
has already warned UNPROFOR Command of this but there has been 
no appropriate reaction. 
  VSR antiaircraft defense units will therefore in the future 
take measure to prevent all Muslim helicopter flights 
contravening the flight ban, the high-ranking VSR sources warned.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Semso Tucakovic] </F>
  [Text] Parallel to the talks of our Prime Minister 
Silajdzic with Croatian Foreign Minister Granic on establishing 
better relations between the two countries and resolving the 
problems that had been created by chauvinists like Mate Boban, 
Jadranko Prlic, Ante Roso, and others, the Croatian Army 
continues to amass its troops on Bosnia-Herzegovina territory. 
  Namely, according to reliable information, the republic [of 
Croatia] has been concentrating major forces in Livno and Ploce 
these days in order to accomplish Tudjman's platform of a 
greater Croatia at the expense of our country. According to 
verified reports, the Croatian Army brigades from Imotski, 
Split, Vinkovci, Sibenik, and the notorious Vukovar Brigade are 
already positioned in Herzegovina and around Gornji Vakuf. We 
must point out that the sending of fresh Croatian troops to 
Bosnia coincides with the publicly made threats to our country 
by numerous individuals from the Croatian state leadership. 
  First Tudjman threatened that he would send the Army to save 
the Croats in central Bosnia. Then the aforementioned Granic did 
the same. 
  However, the essence of the saber rattling on the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina borders and the sending of troops to Bosnian 
gorges has been best explained by Croatian Defense Minister 
Susak and Croatian Ambassador to the United States Mario Nobilo. 
For these two, the war of the Croatian Army in Bosnia means 
defending Croatian ethnic territory and the Croatian state. 
Drago Krpina, commander of the political section of the 
Croatian Army, has recently also announced the increased 
engagement of his formations in central Bosnia. That this is 
not a mere propaganda trick is proven by the mass mobilization 
that is already underway in Croatia, with the intention of 
boosting the troops that are carrying out the aggression against 
our state. 
  The movement of the Ustasha formations and their incursion 
into Bosnia are being carefully monitored by our army, too. 
Necessary precautions are, of course, being taken that will 
thwart the realization of the plans of Tudjman and his generals. 
Our fighters have already acquired abundant experience and 
inflicted a sufficient number of defeats upon the Ustasha 
formations to know what to do. They are also a guarantee that 
the plan of the greater Croatian chauvinists will not be 
realized and that the forthcoming offensive of the Croatian Army 
in Bosnia will merely rapidly increase the number of deceased 
Croatian soldiers who will give their lives for a futile cause. 
  The international community will not observe Croatia's 
aggression against a sovereign and internationally recognized 
state with their arms crossed either. It is perfectly certain 
that Croatian may soon face economic sanctions, which would mean 
the situation in which Serbia is right now. The policies of 
these two neighboring countries have two common traits. They 
share similar political leaderships and unrealistic desire to 
submit and divide Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Within this context, one must also view Ganic's waving of an 
olive branch in Vienna today and yesterday. An olive branch 
will only make sense if the convoys of Croatian tanks stop 
tumbling down Bosnian roads.

  [Excerpt] Banja Luka, 5 Jan (TANJUG) -- According to Serb 
military sources, more than 2,000 Albanians are engaged in the 
Muslim army units, fighting in the war against the Serbs in 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Military sources in the Srpska republic say that this is a 
realistic number based on testimonies given by captured 
Albanians. A large number of Albanians were engaged by Muslim 
units via the Raska region after calls issued by the Party of 
Democratic Action in Novi Pazar and by its leader Sulejman 
Ugljanin. According to Srpska military circles this operation 
had two goals: to help their brothers in faith and to gain 
experience for possible war in Kosovo. [passage omitted]

  [Text] On the personal order of Fikret Abdic, his 
paramilitary formations were supposed to enter (Buzim) on 31 
December. To conquer the domineering elevations around this 
settlement, the paramilitary formations moved into action on 30 
December. On that day, early in the morning, the members of the 
505th Knightly Brigade penetrated deep into the territory 
controlled by the paramilitary formations and in the region of 
(Zboriste), (Cagalica), and (Filarevac) and destroyed the core 
of Abdic's forces, a statement by the Press Center of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army emphasized. 
  In (Zboriste), the forces of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 
captured the complete command of the [?1st] Brigade of the 
so-called Peoples' Defense, headed by Mirsad Huskic, and over 
100 members of Abdic's army, with all their arms and equipment. 
  From documents seized, it was evident that Abdic's fighters 
do not know [words indistinct] that they are poorly informed and 
that [passage indistinct]. In such a situation Abdic is relying 
on the officers from Zagreb such as Adnan Dulovic, former 
colonel [words indistinct], and Albanian [name indistinct], the 
statement says. 
  Abdic is trying to compensate for his powerlessness in the 
military domain by numerous inhumane methods and pressures. He 
is banning the passage of humanitarian aid convoys to the free 
parts of Bihac district and attacking the UN members, the 
statement by the Press Center of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 
emphasizes.

  [Text] Belgrade, Jan 5 (TANJUG) -- Eleven Leopard tanks 
which arrived at the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) logistics 
base in Pancevo over a month ago for the Nordic battalion will 
not go to the Moslem enclave of Tuzla in northern Bosnia. The 
tanks will be sent back to Scandinavia by the end of January. 
  Following the Bosnian Serb authorities' refusal to permit 
any 
heavy weaponry passing through their territory, UNPROFOR and the 
Yugoslav army agreed that the tanks would be returned by rail to 
a Nordic country -- either Denmark, Norway or Sweden, reported 
the Belgrade daily VECERNJE NOVOSTI on Wednesday. 
  The Yugoslav committee for cooperation with UNPROFOR said 
the 
decision was only to be expected as peace in Bosnia cannot be 
established with tanks even though some U.N. sources claim the 
Leopards are not offensive weapons and would only be used for 
patrolling. 
  After two months of talks and accusations that Yugoslavia 
was 
obstructing passage of the tanks to Tuzla, international factors 
have finally perceived that they made a political as well as a 
military mistake, said Yugoslav army sources. 
  The sources said it was made clear to UNPROFOR 
representatives that Yugoslavia was forced by international 
pressure to play host to the Nordic battalion and its 11 Leopard 
tanks, and that UNPROFOR had no grounds under any U.N. documents 
to send heavy weapons to Yugoslavia or Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  U.N. resolutions and documents state that all moves must be 
made with "the agreement of all interested parties," which on 
this occasion was withheld by the Bosnian Serb Republic, wrote 
VECERNJE NOVOSTI. It added that almost the entire Nordic 
battalion with over 1,000 troops and 200 vehicles had been 
transferred from Pancevo to Tuzla. 
  The U.N. peacekeeper's role in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the scene 
of a fierce civil war for the past 20 months, is primarily to 
ensure delivery of humanitarian relief to the civilian 
population. UNPROFOR's mission, however, has been abused on many 
occasions to supply the Moslem side with arms. Evidence on this 
exists and has been presented to U.N. Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali.

  [Text] Belgrade, Jan 5 (TANJUG)--U.S. Ambassador to the 
United Nations Madeleine Albright said sanctions might be 
imposed against Croatia if it did not heed warnings to refrain 
from interfering in the Bosnian civil war. 
  Albright made the statement on Wednesday when replying to a 
question on how Washington would react to Croatia rendering 
military assistance to the Bosnian Croats. Albright underlined 
that Washington had often discussed the situation in Bosnia and 
that Croatia would face sanctions if it did not change its 
stand. Croatian President Franjo Tudjman recently threatened the 
Moslems that Croatia would openly intervene in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina unless they stopped their offensive against 
the Croats. 
  Erstwhile allies in the war against the Bosnian Serbs, the 
Croats and Moslems fell to fighting fiercely last spring over 
territories in central and south-western Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Co-chairman of the Yugoslav Peace Conference Lord Owen said 
in Vienna on Tuesday it was a public secret that Croatia already 
has regular troops in Bosnia. This was confirmed by UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Forces] reports. 
  Regular Croatian troops have been involved in the Bosnian 
civil war since it broke out in April 1992. Their number at the 
end of last year was estimated at 60,000.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Unless the Croatian Army Intervenes </F>
in central Bosnia, Busovaca, Vitez, and Novi Travnik Will Fall!"] 
  [Text] The "Bijeli Put" convoy was perhaps the last 
contact with the Croatian enclaves in central Bosnia, which have 
been encircled by superior Muslim forces for 260 days. Had there 
been no testimony by the brave convoy crew members, which have 
just returned from Nova Bila, the knowledge about the position 
of about 80,000 encircled Croats would be based on assumptions 
and the censored information from the Political Department of 
the Croatian Defense Council, but in this way it was clearly 
said before the Croatian national audiences that the Croats 
would inevitably be expelled from the Lasva Valley if the 
conflict continued. The cooperation of the people with the army 
and their courage and readiness to make sacrifices are not 
enough to defend the century-long Croatian existence in central 
Bosnia. 
  After the loose cooperation between the Bosnian Croats and 
the Muslims broke, the Muslims made the plan to control this 
area, and this plan has been being carried out for months. After 
the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina had occupied Travnik and Bugojno, 
it became clear that they wanted to encircle the enclaves in 
central Bosnia. The occupation of Gornji Vakuf, the ousting of 
the Croatian Defense Council forces from Kakanj, and taking over 
the control over Fojnica were the three stages in which the ring 
around Lasva Valley was closed in. These operations made it 
possible to create a very deep encirclement, which in its 
narrowest part is 40 km long. If it was not situated in an 
impassable mountainous region, which restricts the use of 
military equipment, first of all of armored units, the breaking 
up of this ring would be much easier. What is more, such a 
mountainous region is ideal for the organization of defense; it 
is easy to set ambushes and destroy the enemy's logistics. 
  The mountains, a bad communication network, and winter 
conditions are factors that support the Muslim army since they 
require deployment of infantry forces, which is one of the 
Muslim advantages. Any intervention by Croatian Defense Council 
forces with the aim of breaking the ring around the Lasva Valley 
and reaching the positions of the encircled Croatian units in 
Vitez would require the deployment of large units that will also 
have to secure the corridor through which help is transported to 
Novi Travnik, Vitez, and Busovaca. Instead of the expected 
breaking out of the encirclement toward central Bosnia, the 
Bijeli Put convoy crew was informed about the horrible truth, 
which was transmitted neither by the official agency of 
Herceg-Bosna nor by the Croatian Television correspondents: 
Gornji Vakuf was occupied by Muslims, and the Croatian Defense 
Council units were pushed approximately one and a half 
kilometers toward Prozor, which means that the ring was even 
tightened. The 6th Corps of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina was 
entrusted with the defense of the southern blockade line, which 
could be broken out by the Croatian Defense Council units from 
Herzegovina, and the 3d Zenica Corps of the Bosnian Army was 
entrusted with the destruction of the Croatian forces in Vitez. 
The blockade of the Croatian Defense Council units along the 
inner rim of the encirclement is performed by the Bosnian Army 
units from local villages, whereas the striking force of the 
Muslim Army is composed of the 352d Mountain Brigade and the 7th 
Muslim Brigade from Zenica, known for its extremism and the use 
of Islamic religious symbols. 
  The 17th Krajina Brigade of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
founded in Travnik by the Muslim refugees from the Bosnian 
Krajina, also belongs to the striking force of the Zenica Corps. 
This brigade played the decisive role when Travnik was taken 
over by the Muslims. It is difficult to say how many Muslim 
soldiers are directly involved in the conflict with the Croats 
of the Lasva Valley, but independent sources estimate that there 
are approximately 15,000 Muslims soldiers there. The advantage 
of the Muslim forces is their considerable maneuverability and 
the ability to make groups along certain directions. Although 
Serbian media report on "extensive Muslim offensives," it can be 
said that the Muslim forces apply in this area the tactics of 
exhaustion by a long-lasting blockade, accompanied by 
low-intensity conflicts which might seem local the first sight, 
but the Croatian Defense Council gradually loses control over 
its territory. Since time in the present situation works for 
the Bosnian Army, its commanders adapt the intensity of the 
attacks to their needs. In this way they have the initiative all 
the time -- they choose the modality, the time, and the place of 
an attack according to the defense position of the Croatian 
Defense Council. 
  Although the 3d Corps of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
attacks in all directions, the center of their attacks are two 
directions in the Lasva Valley. Supported by the Kruscica 
Mountain, which is parallel with the Lasva River Valley, they 
launch their attacks at the town of Vitez with the aim of 
creating a connection with the Muslim forces encircled in Stari 
Vitez, which would enable them to reach the right bank of the 
Lasva. Through attacks in the second direction, which extends 
from Zenica via Vjetranica to Dubravica, they want to cut off 
the Croatian area between Novi Travnik, Vitez, and Busovaca with 
the aim of reaching the left bank of the Lasva and merging with 
the southern group of the Bosnian Army units. 
  According to published but not yet confirmed reports, the 
Croatian forces have been pushed back to an area not wider than 
200 meters at its narrowest point. This means that the Lasva 
Valley has been practically cut in two. The latest Muslim 
breakthrough happened after the attack against the Krizanici 
villages, in which around 60 local Croats were either killed or 
are missing. The communication between Busovaca in the east and 
Vitez in the west is now possible only under constant sniper and 
mortar fire coming from the positions of the 3d Corps of the 
Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Under these unfavorable conditions, including the imbalance 
of forces and bad weather conditions in an unfavorable area, 
decisive resistance is offered by the three Vitez brigades of 
the Croatian Defense Council, whose commander is the famous 
Tihomir Blaskic. The "Stjepan Tomasevic" brigade from Novi 
Travnik, the brigade of the "knights," and the "Nikola Subic 
Zrinski" brigade lost many of their members and are inferior to 
the aggressor. The proportion of forces regarding the number of 
soldiers fell from two to one to five to one in favor of the 
Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The offensive of the forces loyal to 
Izetbegovic which started on 18 December even continued during 
the Geneva and Brussels peace talks. It stopped only on 
Christmas Day, but was resumed with varying intensity after the 
holiday. 
  Apart from central Bosnia, there are conflicts between 
Croats 
and Muslims also north of Mostar. There are clashes there for 
control of Dreznica, a village and a small river of the same 
name. The Dreznica flows into the Neretva River some 15 km north 
of Mostar. Lower intensity clashes are reported also from 
southern positions of the 111th Zepca Brigade of the Croatian 
Defense Council. The inhabitants of Usor are lucky that the 
representatives of the War Presidency of Tesanj, which consists 
of both Muslims and Croats, declined to carry out the order 
given by the Sarajevo Headquarters of the Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina according to which the members of the 110th 
Usor Brigade of the Croatian Defense Council should have been 
put under the command of the 7th Operative Group of the Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The war alliance and human lives are 
temporarily preserved. 
  The encircled 80,000 women, children, old people, some 
soldiers, the wounded, and the sick in central Bosnia are still 
exposed to attacks by the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, although 
Slobodan Praljak, a movie director and the Croatian Defense 
Council commander for this area, was replaced by General Roso, a 
professional soldier, a former commander in the Foreign Legion, 
but this could have not changed the balance of forces. Even a 
much more powerful army than the Croatian Defense Council could 
not occupy the inaccessible mountains of central Bosnia. From 
the military point of view these positions are untenable in the 
long run. The civilians can be rescued -- by evacuation -- only 
if a cease-fire is reached. An open intervention by the 
Croatian Army with the aim of liberating the encircled people is 
quite a possible and practicable solution, in spite of the 
threats of sanctions, because almost 100,000 human lives have to 
be rescued!

  [Text] We have just received a statement saying that 
Croatian President Dr. Franjo Tudjman today received Yasushi 
Akashi, special envoy of the UN secretary general and main 
UNPROFOR coordinator, on his inaugural visit. 
  Having extended his welcome greetings and best wishes for 
the 
successful discharging of the latter's very important duty, the 
president of our republic expressed pleasure that the UN 
secretary general himself appointed Akashi, who would help find 
a solution to end the war in this area using his knowledge and 
experience. 
  President Tudjman informed Mr. Akashi about the situation in 
the UN protected areas and Croatian views towards the cessation 
of hostilities in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He expressed hope that 
regarding the Republic of Croatia, temporary cease-fires in UN 
protected areas would turn into permanent ones. In this 
connection he said that the Croatian policy was permanently 
directed towards speedy resolution of the UN protected areas in 
line with relevant UN resolutions. 
  As regards the Bosnia-Herzegovina war, he said that further 
Muslim aggression against Croat enclaves in central Bosnia, 
where more than 60,000 people are under siege, ought to be 
halted immediately. Dr. Tudjman also informed Mr. Akashi about 
talks a Croatian delegation held in Vienna with representatives 
of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government. Dr. Tudjman said that he 
had launched an initiative to meet Alija Izetbegovic and that 
the meeting would take place in the next few days. 
  Yakushi Akashi said that he would do everything possible to 
contribute to the restoration of peace, stability, and happiness 
in this area. He also thanked President Tudjman and 
congratulated him on making efforts for the restoration of peace 
and gave him his assurances that in all negotiations Croatia's 
interests would be taken into consideration. 
  Yakushi Akashi was accompanied by General (Viglijk Eide) and 
General Jean Cot.

  [Text] Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and 
foreign minister, today received Yasushi Akashi, the UN 
secretary general's newly appointed special envoy for former 
Yugoslavia. 
  Minister Granic informed his guest about the process and 
results of the talks he had yesterday with Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic in Vienna. He laid particular 
stress on the importance of an urgent cessation of hostilities 
between the Croats and Muslims in central Bosnia, an issue on 
which Presidents Franjo Tudjman and Alija Izetbegovic will have 
talks in Bonn on Saturday. 
  After informing his guest about the situation in the 
occupied 
areas of Croatia, Minister Granic said Croatia is resolved to 
achieve a solution for these areas in a peaceful way through 
negotiations in accordance with relevant UN Security Council 
resolutions. But he also mentioned the decisive responsibility 
borne by Serbia and Slobodan Milosevic for the present situation 
in these areas, and stated the readiness of local power-holders 
to negotiate and reach a peaceful solution to all problems. 
  Yasushi Akashi pointed out he will do everything possible to 
implement all relevant UN Security Council resolutions and that 
he expects close cooperation with and support from the Croatian 
authorities in implementing the complex task of the United 
Nations, and particularly the UN Protection Force, in restoring 
peace and stability in this area.

  [Text] [Yasuhi Akashi, in English with superimposed 
Serbo-Croatian translation] "Croatia is one of the main parties 
in this tragic conflict which is the main concern of the United 
Nations and the international community. We must not forget 
that Croatia offered its hospitality to the UN Protection Forces 
[UNPROFOR] command. For us it is important to meet with your 
leaders, to have their understanding and their support and to 
make sure that we share common aims and objectives." 
  [Correspondent] Yasuhi Akashi's statement at the end of the 
third working day in his capacity as new UNPROFOR envoy was 
assessed positively. The last meeting Akashi had today -- with 
Hrvoje Sarinic -- opened up new prospects for cooperation 
between Croatia and UNPROFOR. 
  [Sarinic] "Mr. Akashi is a very experienced politician and 
UN 
official. He knows what he is doing and saying and he knows what 
he wants. He had a great deal of success in his previous 
assignments, especially the last one in Cambodia, which was a 
complete success. Apart from that, there were poor 
communications with the United Nations and I think that the 
UNPROFOR and its command were very dissatisfied with 
coordination so far. Mr. Akashi, who is starting his job now, 
will devote all his time at work and energy to this problem. I 
also think, as far as this is concerned, that this is a definite 
improvement on the existing situation." 
  [Correspondent] The activity of UNPROFOR, i.e. of Yasuhi 
Akashi and also of the Croatian side, will advance a little at a 
time, but what comes next, i.e. what is expected, is UNPROFOR's 
help in reaching an agreement on the end of hostilities here. 
  [Akashi] "We specifically discussed the problem of the UN 
protected areas in the southern part of this country, the 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the humanitarian [word 
indistinct] and refugees. I am pleased to hear that our stands 
on all these problems do not differ from Croatia's. To all this 
let us add a new approach to cooperation between Croatia and the 
UNPROFOR. All disagreements and complaints will from now on be 
individually examined to avoid generalization concerning the 
inefficiency of the UNPROFOR in Croatia."

  [Excerpt] A UN High Commission for Refugees [UNHCR] convoy, 
which left Metkovic this morning for Zenica and Tuzla, was 
stopped at the Croatian Defense Council's [HVO] border 
checkpoint because of its failure to ask for a permit from the 
mixed commission and to fulfill other conditions required by the 
protocol on the organization of humanitarian operations, the 
Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna government office for cooperation 
with the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR], the European Union 
[EU], and international organizations says in its statement. 
  The convoy was instructed to return to Metkovic because the 
vehicles arrived at the border checkpoint without the necessary 
documents required by the regulations and agreements on 
humanitarian convoys and because the cargo was not checked at 
the point of departure. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Belgrade, Jan 5 (TANJUG) -- Sales in Yugoslav stores 
have plunged steeply as the result of monetary chaos and a 
dramatic decline in living standards caused by the U.N. 
sanctions imposed against Yugoslavia in May 1992. 
  Retailers are finding it increasingly hard to obtain goods 
as 
production has virtually ground to a halt. Many of the 70,000 
shop assistants in Belgrade go to work out of habit. Downtown 
supermarkets, once full of domestic and imported delicacies, are 
now empty of both goods and customers and in many shops the only 
items offered for sale are a few bottles of mineral water or 
cans of sardines. 
  For a majority of Belgrade stores, Wednesday was the ninth 
consecutive day on which they stayed closed. Because of the 
runaway inflation, which reached one million percent in 
December, they are loathe to accept the national currency in 
payment for their wares. The value of their takings is 
completely eroded within a matter of hours and is not enough for 
even a fraction of the stocks they need. 
  Since cash money is increasingly in short supply, people 
have 
to pay for many things with checks. And more and more cashiers 
in socially-owned as well as private stores are refusing to 
accept checks or any kind of plastic money. Even farmers at the 
open-air markets take dinars unwillingly. 
  For months now, the German mark has been in use as a 
currency 
and a basis for formation of prices. Even the value of the mark 
has declined in Yugoslavia. A liter of milk which sold at 0.25 
marks before the new year holiday now costs one German mark, 
while the average wage amounts to about 10 marks and pensions 
less than five. 
  The crisis has led to the disappearance of the middle class. 
Sociologists say 95 percent of the population is poor, while the 
remainder is very wealthy, mainly from illegal gains from crime 
or the black market. 
  Many economists are surprised that the monetary and 
financial 
systems have not caved in completely by now. 
  The federal government announced implementation of a program 
to rehabilitate the monetary system and curb hyperinflation for 
January. However, it underlined that easing of the sanctions 
and unblocking of Yugoslav assets abroad were prerequisites for 
the program's success.

  [Text] Belgrade, 5 Jan (TANJUG) -- Slobodan Milosevic, 
president of the Republic of Serbia, received Thorvald 
Stoltenberg and David Owen, cochairmen of the Geneva Conference, 
and their aides who arrived in Belgrade this afternoon, it was 
announced in Belgrade this evening. 
  On the Serbian side, the meeting was also attended by 
Radovan 
Karadzic, president of the Srpska republic; Momcilo Krajisnik, 
president of the Srpska republic assembly; Srpska Vice President 
Nikola Koljevic; Srpska Foreign Minister Aleksa Buha; and 
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic. They exchanged 
views with Thorvald Stoltenberg, David Owen, and their aides in 
connection with efforts to achieve a peace agreement for former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as about issues linked with creating 
conditions for the successful outcome of the peace process. 
  The Serbian side noted that it has fulfilled its part of the 
obligation toward the European Twelve by securing 33.3 percent 
of the territory for the Muslim republic and that the European 
Union is now expected to fulfill its part of the obligation 
which refers to the lifting of sanctions against the FRY 
[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]. The view of the Serbian side 
is that the remaining issues -- which are of lesser importance 
-- can be successfully resolved in the course of further 
negotiations, the cabinet of the Serbian president announced.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dragoljub Micunovic, leader of the </F>
Democratic Party, by Milenko Pesic; place and date not given: 
"Micunovic: `I Might Have Achieved a Bigger Success in the 
Election'"] 
  [Text] The Democratic Party members do not seem to have the 
time to celebrate their election success. Immediately after the 
votes were counted, the passions in the party leadership were 
stirred up because Zoran Djindjic insisted, also formally, on 
becoming chairman of the party. 
  We spoke with Dragoljub Micunovic, who has been the chairman 
of the party for four years now, about the complex relations and 
splits within the party and about the announcement of the 
Democratic Party assembly in which a new party chairman should 
be elected. 
  Micunovic pointed out which decisions were taken by the 
Democratic Party bodies, and what the election procedure should 
be like according to the bylaws, concluding that the assembly 
scheduled for the beginning of February can only be 
extraordinary (its agenda has already been defined) and in no 
case electoral. 
  "It is possible that one-third of the delegates fills up the 
agenda with the procedure by which my resignation from the 
position of the party chairman would be required. If this 
requirement is rejected, it is not possible to call for a vote 
of censure in the party leader until the next regular electoral 
assembly (in 1994)," Micunovic explained the complicated 
election procedure. 
  If it happens that Micunovic, as he says himself, does not 
obtain the vote of confidence, his duty will be taken over by 
one of the Democratic Party vice chairmen, and the procedure for 
the election of a new chairman will start. 
<H5>  I Shall Ask for Fair Play </H5>
  [Pesic] Will you run for the position of the party chairman 
if the delegates do not vote for confidence in you as the party 
chairman? 
  [Micunovic] No, I shall not run for this position. Why 
should I run for the position of the party chairman? If the 
Main Committee in its session on 9 January 1994 opens a 
discussion on the confidence in the party chairman, I shall try 
to make the month between this session and the scheduled 
assembly at the beginning of February a period of democratic 
fair play. I shall support the principle of equal treatment and 
insist on the opportunity to visit our communal committees in 
order to present my platform there and hear critical opinions 
from our members at the same time. 
  [Pesic] You deny the impression created in public that your 
position as party chairman has been weakened by the fact that 
Djindjic won the election. You stress that "the Democratic 
Party won the election." 
  If you had been the bearer of the election lists, would you 
have achieved the same result? 
  [Micunovic] Perhaps an even better result, but this is mere 
speculation. Djindjic also led the Democratic Party campaign in 
earlier elections. He made decisions now and then about the 
posters, TV spots, and so forth. I would like to point out that 
our party campaign was carried out in a very professional way 
this time and stood out because of its standard. The success of 
a party cannot, however, be attributed to only one man. 
  Have you ever heard that if a party has been successful in 
an 
election, its chairman is dismissed after that? As far as 
Djindjic's candidacy is concerned, it is his right according to 
our bylaws to run for party chairman. Since the candidacy was 
started in the middle of an election period, it is necessary to 
respect the procedure defined by the bylaws. 
<H5>  Personalized Race </H5>
  [Pesic] The impression was created in public that it is 
quite natural that Djindjic replaces you in the position of the 
party chairman after the success he achieved in this election. 
  [Micunovic] This impression was created by the media because 
Zoran Djindjic carried out two campaigns. One for the party, in 
which he fought for votes, and the other for himself. The 
Democratic Party election campaign was personalized. TV spots, 
posters, badges, cigarette lighters were marked exclusively with 
Djindjic's name. This resulted in the impression that the 
Democratic Party is connected only with his name. 
  I think highly of all of Djindjic's qualities and merits for 
the achieved election result, but the Democratic Party decided 
not to be a party characterized by its leader. 
  I do not want to deny that splits arouse within the 
Democratic Party because of Djindjic's candidacy for the 
position of party chairman. I think that it is sensible to make 
changes only if a party chairman harms his party or destroys its 
reputation. 
  [Pesic] How can the present splits, which harm the party, 
be overcome? 
  [Micunovic] The decisions taken by the Central Committee 
have to be respected. One of these decisions is that all 
Democratic Party bodies must function according to the effective 
bylaws. Only in this way can we overcome the present 
polarization. 
  [Pesic] There is still the impression that you are supported 
only by a party minority after this election. 
  [Micunovic] This is something to be measured yet. It is 
certain that during the election the popularity of Mr. Djindjic 
rose. The final decision, however, will be taken by the 
assembly delegates. 
  I have contacts with the Executive Committee chairman 
[Djindjic], but our relations are not as normal as they should 
be. The reason for it is his engagement in the election campaign 
that was completed only a few days ago. 
<H5>  Compromise in the Interest of the Party </H5>
  [Pesic] There are people who think that you should have 
resigned after this election because the Democratic Party 
achieved poor results in their opinion. 
  [Micunovic] This would mean that everybody who does not win 
an election, and no opposition party in Serbia has been 
successful so far, has to resign. This is a bad comparison with 
the English Parliament in which there are three parties. Also 
after this election, the Democratic Party has remained the 
fourth strongest party, before the Socialist Party, the Radical 
Party and the DEPOS, and we have no chance of endangering the 
Socialist Party. We obtained half a million votes this time, 
and in the previous election for the Federal Parliament we 
obtained in the coalition with the "Reformers" 460,000 votes. 
  In the interest of the party I made a compromise and agreed 
with the proposal that Djindjic bore the election lists. In 
this way I agreed to sacrifice a part of my prestige and I do 
not regret my decision. I think that the party will correctly 
understand my readiness to serve the Democratic Party -- I do 
not want the party to serve me. 
  The Democratic Party is organized according to democratic 
standards in order to be an alternative to the communist and 
socialist party. The Democratic Party has in this way become 
the model of the democratic political milieu in contrast to the 
long-lasting authoritarian way of thinking. If the Democratic 
Party gave up its original political intentions, it would betray 
most of its members and supporters who joined us because they 
did not way authoritarian leaders. I believe that the 
Democratic party will not give up its principles.

  [Text] Pristina, Jan 5 (TANJUG) -- The Association of 
Albanians, Serbs and Montenegrins for a United Serbia and 
Yugoslavia on Wednesday called on the ethnic Albanians in 
Kosovo-Metohija, especially intellectuals, to raise their voice 
against extremists and encourage their fellow countrymen to 
return to normal studies and work and building a common life in 
this Serbian province. 
  In a statement to the public, the association warned of "the 
disastrous results of the policy of extremist Albanian political 
parties" in Kosovo-Metohija, manifested in the mass quitting of 
jobs, schools and university. This policy has deprived a whole 
generation of young Albanians of proper schooling. 
  On the other hand, leaders of extremist Albanian parties and 
war profiteers secured a good life for themselves and their 
children, usurping for themselves the benefits that belong to 
all in the province. They therefore have no moral right to 
speak on behalf of all Albanians, said the statement. 
  The separatist ethnic Albanian leadership, which advocates 
Kosovo-Metohija's secession from Yugoslavia and joining it to 
neighboring Albania, exerts constant pressures on its fellow 
countrymen to disregard the laws of Serbia and the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia, to leave their jobs and refuse to pay 
taxes. 
  Succumbing to these pressures, a majority of ethnic 
Albanians 
boycotted the 1990, 1992 and 1993 elections.

  [Text] Tirana, January 5 (ATA) -- [words indistinct] On 
January 3, 1994, at 1030 hrs, in the border sign D14/18, in 
Zapod of Kukes, the Yugoslav border soldiers killed the Albanian 
citizen Ramadan Ibrahim Mustafa, 25 years, who was 5.5 meters in 
the Yugoslav territory. They opened fire against Ramadan at a 
15 meter distance causing him five wounds. 
  On the same day, at 1500, in the border zone of Tropoje, 
Serbian border forces opened fire from the Yugoslav territory 
wounding seriously in the Albanian zone the Albanian Citizen 
Hamid Ram Sallaku, 20 years. 
  These grave criminal acts, encouraged by vile anti-Albanian 
aims of Serbian chauvinists, are made in the course of similar 
acts in the past. In the incidents occurring in the border of 
Albania with Serbia and Montenegro, all the wounded and killed 
have been Albanians, none of them has been Serbian. With the 
last two victims, the number of those killed since the beginning 
of 1993 becomes 21. Such criminal acts are part of the strategy 
of tension and war that Milosevic is following, thus stirring up 
situations with unprecedented consequences in the region. 
  The Albanian Foreign Ministry forcefully protests against 
these incidents, which should be put an end immediately.

  [Text] Tirana, January 5 (ATA) -- [words indistinct] On 
January 3, 1994, at 1030 hrs, in the border sign D14/18, in 
Zapod of Kukes, the Yugoslav border soldiers killed the Albanian 
citizen Ramadan Ibrahim Mustafa, 25 years, who was 5.5 meters in 
the Yugoslav territory. They opened fire against Ramadan at a 
15 meter distance causing him five wounds. 
  On the same day, at 1500, in the border zone of Tropoje, 
Serbian border forces opened fire from the Yugoslav territory 
wounding seriously in the Albanian zone the Albanian Citizen 
Hamid Ram Sallaku, 20 years. 
  These grave criminal acts, encouraged by vile anti-Albanian 
aims of Serbian chauvinists, are made in the course of similar 
acts in the past. In the incidents occurring in the border of 
Albania with Serbia and Montenegro, all the wounded and killed 
have been Albanians, none of them has been Serbian. With the 
last two victims, the number of those killed since the beginning 
of 1993 becomes 21. Such criminal acts are part of the strategy 
of tension and war that Milosevic is following, thus stirring up 
situations with unprecedented consequences in the region. 
  The Albanian Foreign Ministry forcefully protests against 
these incidents, which should be put an end immediately.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 5/1/1994 -- "The Social 
Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR], that assumed the 
responsibility of ruling the country in these difficult moments 
of crisis, is keen on reaffirming on this occasion as well that 
Romania's integration in the Euro-Atlantic structures is a 
fundamental objective of our foreign policy," reads a communique 
released in Bucharest on 5 January. "From this position, PDSR 
fully backs the official efforts Romania is making to become a 
member of the North Atlantic Alliance. PDSR salutes the 
initiative of Romania's President Ion Iliescu to address on 24 
December a letter to the heads of states or governments of the 
NATO member states, before the upcoming meeting of the alliance, 
reconfirming Romania's constant interest to become a full member 
of the NATO structures. 
  PDSR took note with satisfaction of the recent declarations 
of high officials in the U.S. Administration, according to whom 
"the Partnership for Peace" is for the budding democracies in 
Europe, Romania included, a first step in the process of their 
integration in the NATO structures and a guarantee of security 
at the same time. We are sure that under the conditions of the 
political developments in our proximity, NATO will be in a 
position to offer security guarantees to Romania, necessary for 
preserving its national being and ensuring conditions for 
carrying the democratic transformations the Romanian people has 
committed to since the December 1989 revolution. 
  On the eve of the Brussels meeting of the NATO countries, 
PDSR expresses hope that Romania's security interests will 
resonate with the leaders of the NATO member states, that no 
discriminatory practices will be accepted concerning the 
countries interested to enter the Euro-Atlantic structures. At 
the same time, we understand the concerns repeatedly expressed 
by the U.S. Administration and other NATO member countries for 
not isolating Russia and for taking into account its security 
interests, without prejudicing in this way Romania's security 
interests."

<F P=106> [Report by Elisa Wasch on statements by UN and EU mediators </F>
Thorvald Stoltenberg and Lord David Owen in Vienna on 5 January; 
statements are in English with superimposed German translation 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] [Wasch] Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Silajdzic 
and Croatian Foreign Minister Granic assessed yesterday's talks 
in Vienna positively. They agreed to the return of the Muslims 
driven away from Mostar by the Croats. But the tough problems 
-- the controversial territorial issues -- will be discussed 
today. UN mediator Stoltenberg and European Union [EU] mediator 
Lord Owen commented on the negotiations this morning after a 
meeting with Austria's Foreign Minister Mock. 
  Before today's talks, hopes for a peaceful solution for 
Bosnia were very slim. In fact, both the Croatian and the 
Bosnian representatives described yesterday's talks as 
constructive, but a solution has been in sight too often in the 
past before the talks eventually failed. But UN mediator 
Thorvald Stoltenberg assessed today's talks positively. 
  [Stoltenberg] Well, I am always optimistic. If I were not 
optimistic, I could not survive in this job. 
  [Wasch] His partner in the marathon talks, EU negotiator 
Lord Owen, is commenting on the negotiations of the warring 
parties with increasingly sharp words. 
  [Owen] I am afraid we have to tell you that there is a big 
difference between the decisions adopted during negotiations and 
the actual situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The fighting is 
continuing there. The Muslims are continuing to send troops to 
central Bosnia, and the Croats are continuing to send troops to 
Herceg-Bosna. Unfortunately, we see no signs of an end to the 
war. Quite the contrary; the Muslims are trying to capture more 
villages in central Bosnia -- Busovaca and Vitez, for example. 
  [Wasch] Yesterday the delegations from Zagreb and Sarajevo 
agreed to organize the return of refugees who left Mostar. The 
Muslims driven away from there should be allowed to return. 
Yet, according to Lord Owen, this is only wishful thinking 
because there is war in Mostar, the Croatian [as heard] capital 
of Herzegovina. 
  [Owen] I cannot see how on earth you can possibly hope to 
get people back to Mostar if the war continues there, even 
though there may be sporadic cease-fires. 
  [Wasch] Only if Mostar is placed under EU control, as 
planned, would the repatriation program stand a chance, Owen 
stated. Territorial issues will be discussed at today's talks in 
Vienna. Access to the Adriatic Sea for the Muslims and a 
cease-fire for embattled central Bosnia will be the major 
topics. It would be a miracle if agreement were achieved on 
these issues, and if it were implemented. Negotiations are 
scheduled to end at noon.

<F P=106> [Report by fr: "The Slovak Republic Exceeded the Clearing </F>
Account Margin"] 
  [Text] Prague--The deficit of Slovakia on the clearing 
account for trade with the Czech Republic reached the amount of 
169.39 million ECU's on 31 December 1993. Hence, the margin set 
by the payments agreement (130 million ECU's) has been overdrawn 
for the first time since this method of financing of the trade 
between the Czech and the Slovak Republics was introduced. 
  Interest of 10 percent is due on the amount by which the 
margin was overdrawn, and, according to the payment agreement, 
the debtor must cover this amount in convertible currency within 
15 days. Otherwise, the penalty interest is raised to 15 
percent. The Czech National Bank has not planned talks with the 
Slovak side so far because the debtor should cover the margin 
excess practically automatically, Jan Vit, vice governor of the 
Czech National Bank told HOSPODARSKE NOVINY yesterday in this 
respect. 
  The Czech National Bank is conducting a so-called annulment 
of the old lot and its transfer to the new lot at the end of 
each month. In December, the old lot shows a deficit in Slovak 
payments in the amount of 46.78 million ECU's, and, on the new 
lot, the Czech Republic had a surplus of 122.13 million ECU's. 
The old lot records in the 1 to 1 ratio all payments for trade 
prior to the currency separation; the new lot records payments 
for trading after this date.

  [Text] At a news conference at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs today, spokesman Mircea Geoana announced that the first 
action of that ministry in 1994 will be the visit to Bucharest, 
which will begin today, by the first deputy minister of foreign 
affairs of the Republic of Moldova, Mr. Ion Cebuc, at the 
invitation of Ambassador Marcel Dinu, state secretary. Among 
other things, an exchange of views will also take place in 
connection with developments in Central and East Europe, the 
situation in the Dniester region, and the fate of the Ilascu 
group. 
  Regarding Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's statements about Romania 
and the Romanian people, and about other European states -- 
which were termed irresponsible -- the Foreign Ministry 
spokesman emphasized that these statements have caused the 
unanimous reaction of condemnation in the political media and 
international public opinion. 
  The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has acknowledged 
with particular interest the statements made by the U.S. 
representative at the United Nations, Mrs. Madeleine Albright, 
whereby she emphasizes that the United States rejects the idea 
of creating demarcation lines in Central and Eastern Europe, and 
that, as far as the U.S. Administration is concerned, all 
countries in this area have the same political and strategic 
interest, the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
stated at the same weekly news conference. He added that Mrs. 
Albright will pay a visit to Bucharest on 15 January as 
President Bill Clinton's special envoy. The main purpose of the 
visit is to brief the authorities in Bucharest on the results of 
the NATO summit, and specifically on tangible aspects of the 
partnership-for-peace alternative. 
  During a meeting with Romania's president, with the Romanian 
foreign minister, and other figures, the sides will also discuss 
Romanian-U.S. bilateral relations, the Yugoslav crisis and the 
effects on the Romanian economy of the sanctions imposed against 
the Yugoslav Federation, as well as cooperation with the United 
Nations. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman also emphasized 
that the letters addressed to the U.S. President by Romania's 
president also present our country's concerns about security. 
They clearly emphasize Romania's desire for NATO integration, a 
subject that enjoys the consensus among Romanian political 
forces. 
  At the same news conference by the Romanian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs spokesman, journalists were informed that the 
letter from President Ion Iliescu on 24 December 1993 to the 
heads of state and government of the NATO member countries and 
the NATO secretary general regarding Romania's desire for 
integration in the alliance as a member with full rights was 
positively received by the member states and viewed by the 
majority of the representatives of the ministries of foreign 
affairs or of the offices of the heads of state and government 
as being particularly opportune. 
  The move by the Romanian president was assessed as being 
direct, firm, and clear. On receipt of the letter, the 
representatives of several countries emphasized that they will 
support Romania in its effort toward integration into NATO and 
the other Euro-Atlantic structures. 
  As our reporter, Doina Saiciuc, informs us, this letter from 
Romania's president was unanimously assessed as an important 
sign of the absolute priority Romania gives to intensifying its 
political, economic, and security relations with the Western 
countries.

<F P=106> [Interview with Stanislav Stoilov, "economic expert" of the </F>
Russian Liberal Democratic Party, headed by Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, by Valeriya Veleva at Sofia Airport; date not 
given: "I Shall Be President of the Balkans, and We Will Throw 
the Parties Into the Sea"] 
  [Text] A few minutes before taking off for Vienna, 
accompanied by the second man in command of Zhirinovskiy's 
party, Stanislav Stoilov, the businessman from the town of 
Sandanski, explained his plans for the near future related to 
his political activities in the Balkan peninsula. We are 
publishing the following interview without any editorial 
intervention. 
  [Veleva] Mr. Stoilov, while vacationing at the "Sandanski" 
Hotel, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy managed to pay a brief visit to 
Salonika. What kind of business took you to the shores of the 
Aegean Sea? 
  [Stoilov] We visited Salonika without a visa and without 
passports. There were approximately 10 of us, including the 
bodyguards, and they let us cross the border. We went there for 
negotiations with the government of certain people with whom we 
had arranged meetings in advance. [sentence as published] The 
Salonika police accompanied us at all times with their lights 
on, while, here in this country, we were met by Turkish bandits 
who were demonstrating against us. 
  [Veleva] Do you really intend to become Bulgarian president, 
as Mr. Zhirinovskiy designated you? 
  [Stoilov] Me, Bulgarian president?! This would be an insult 
for me. I shall become president of the Balkans (the Balkan 
peninsula -- TRUD editorial note). This will be followed by a 
great upheaval in Bulgaria. We shall throw all the parties that 
exist in the country today into the Black Sea. The plan is 
ready. There will be an upheaval of all parties that were 
guilty for Bulgaria's disintegration from 1944 until their 
capitulation. All those who have committed murders, who have 
sent people to concentration camps, who have interned them 
(mispronounces the word -- TRUD editorial note), who have 
altered streets and cities, who are guilty of laundering 
[waschen -- in German] -- all those people should be put on 
trial! All of them! 
  [Veleva] How do you plan to become president of all the 
Balkan states? 
  [Stoilov] Yes, I shall become president of all Balkans! You 
will hear about it. The plan is ready. 
  [Veleva] Who is going to help you? 
  [Stoilov] I shall do it all by myself! We do not need 
anyone's assistance. We have the strength. This is our 
problem. You will see. 
  [Veleva] When is this supposed to happen? 
  [Stoilov] Very soon. Macedonia's liberation, the annexation 
of Thracia, the seizing of Dobrudzha. All of these will become 
one state. Tsar Boris II, a Bulgarian who lives...in Madrid, 
remains the leader of all this. 
  [Veleva] I have never heard of such a king living in Madrid. 
  [Stoilov] There is a king...the son of King Boris. (He 
totally confuses the names -- TRUD editorial note) Well, it is 
actually King Simeon II. He shall be the king of Bulgaria as 
usual. 
  [Veleva] Will he be subordinate to you? 
  [Stoilov] No, he shall rule Bulgaria, while I rule the 
Balkans. 
  [Veleva] Does it mean that Bulgaria will become a monarchy 
subject under a large territory ruled by a president? 
  [Stoilov] Yes! Bulgaria was founded 1,300 years ago by 
kings, and many kings have sacrificed their lives for Bulgaria, 
and Bulgaria, created by kings, shall be a Bulgarian kingdom. 
Numerous parties exist in Bulgaria today, but he (the king -- 
TRUD editorial note) will come. I will take care of Macedonia 
and other states -- I mean territories that belong to Bulgaria 
but were taken from us. I will help to annex Dobrudzha and parts 
of other states that were taken.... Edirne, for example, as long 
as it has something to do with Yugoslavia and Macedonia. 
[sentence as published] How exactly the Balkans will be ruled 
with Bulgaria remains to be clarified in a personal talk with 
King Simeon II, who lives in Spain. We shall hold a conference 
with him. I contacted his secretary -- she speaks Bulgarian -- 
and after the New Year, I mean after the holidays, we shall hold 
such a meeting. 
  [Veleva] How is the Bulgarian republic expected to turn into 
a kingdom? 
  [Stoilov] This is.... It is related to a plan that we must 
await. It is a long-term plan, very long-term, indeed. There 
are many things we cannot tell you in advance because you are a 
journalist. If you were a politician, and if we were sitting in 
a room behind closed doors, and if you belonged to our party, we 
might reveal the whole plan to you. However, it is our own 
plan. We shall never leave the Balkans and the Bulgarians under 
different commands, with territories robbed from all parts. 
Bulgaria and Macedonia together shall be a great state. 
  [Veleva] Are those plans of yours likely to provoke a 
military conflict in the Balkans? 
  [Stoilov] We are so strong that no one would dare to do 
anything. In saying "we," I mean our party -- Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy's party! 
  [Veleva] How did he react to his expulsion from Bulgaria? 
  [Stoilov] He was not expelled from Bulgaria. They know that 
he is dangerous, for Bulgaria as well; hence, they have no right 
to expel him. He is my personal friend. I asked him to stay 
another five days, but he has his own program. They (the 
authorities -- TRUD editorial note) could never expel him. I 
have an Austrian passport and a Bulgarian passport. Me, being a 
citizen of Bulgaria, he can stay with me for another 100 years. 
This so-called provision that he must be expelled from Bulgaria 
is part of the propaganda spread by the other parties. 
  [Veleva] Did you meet Todor Zhivkov? 
  [Stoilov] No, but we would like to meet him. He is nicer 
than Zhelyu Zhelev. There was discipline under him, and he is 
not guilty. He was ruled by Moscow. 
  [Veleva] I know that it is not a very decent question, but 
are you a rich man? 
  [Stoilov] I have worked hard and I am a rich man, as a 
matter of fact. I have several millions, but I am not a 
billionaire. However, I do have a lot of money. I have 
purchased automobiles and apartments for my sisters, as well as 
my sisters' children. My house in Sveti Vrach, called Sandanski 
today, which was confiscated in the past, is being totally 
rebuilt. I am also building a house with four floors in the 
Pirin mountain, at a height of 1,300 meters. I usually visit 
Bulgaria once or twice a month, but we are starting on a world 
tour now. We have very important tasks. 
  [Veleva] Was Mr. Zhirinovskiy very offended when he left 
Bulgaria? 
  [Stoilov] He was very offended by Mr. Zhelev's policy 
because they [the Russians] have liberated Bulgaria from the 
Turkish yoke, which lasted 500 years, and no matter which party 
he belongs to, he is a Soviet man, after all. 
  (In the meantime, Mr. Venedikov, who is the second man in 
command of Zhirinovskiy's party and future defense 
minister-designate, joined the conversation and stated as 
follows -- TRUD editorial note) 
  [Venedikov] As soon as we take over the power in Russia, the 
fate of the whole world shall be predetermined. Everything will 
fall into place, as it is correct and appropriate for the 
peoples of all countries.

  [Text] Zvornik, Jan 5 (TANJUG) -- The peace in the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina depends only on the 
Moslem side, said General Milan Gvero, assistant commander of 
the general staff of the Bosnian Serb Army. 
  The non-acceptance of peace and agreement on cessation of 
clashes and territorial division as well as certain open 
encouragement (from the Moslem leadership) for the continuation 
of the war are the main characteristics of the Moslem 
religious-political activities in recent months, Gvero said in a 
statement to TANJUG. 
  He also pointed at the fickleness of the Moslem negotiators, 
the deliberate ambiguity of their stands and their failure to 
keep their word and observe signed documents. 
  The assistant commander of the general staff of the Army of 
the Bosnian Serb Republic, however, assessed that "political 
realists, which have increasingly more followers, such as Fikret 
Abdic and individuals in Tuzla, Zenica, Sarajevo and in other 
places have started to appear among the Moslems." He added that 
attempts, mainly unsuccessful, have been made to prevent these 
people by means of political terror and armed violence. 
  "Clashes between Moslem formations in different parts of the 
Moslem-controlled territory are ever more frequent, fierce and 
on a broader-scale," Gen. Gvero recalled and said "the life of 
the majority of the Moslems, politically uninterested, is very 
difficult and rapidly deteriorating." 
  Precisely due to this fact the Moslem authorities, as Gen. 
Gvero said, have been attempting to conquer Serb and Croat 
territories with arms in order to gain political points and calm 
the ever broader social rebellion. 
  Speaking about the Moslem propaganda regarding the losses 
inflicted on Bosnian Serbs, Gen. Gvero said it was in fact "an 
attempt to prevent the pronounced erosion of the moral of the 
Moslem troops and population." 
  "These propaganda attempts are sufficiently transparent that 
no one believes in them," he said and added that the Moslems 
should know to demand "responsibility from those who are 
plunging them into sure death and further unnecessary suffering 
while they themselves are getting richer on account of the war 
and have houses and foreign exchange savings abroad." 
  "The Moslem people and the forcibly mobilized troops should 
know that peace could be achieved very quickly," Gen. Gvero said 
and underscored that "Moslem leaders, who from warm offices 
thunderously speak of war in which they push others, are guilty 
if there is no peace." 
  "It is obviously an attempt to pursue policies and wage war 
according to religious canons," Gen. Gvero concluded and added 
that the Army and the leadership of the Bosnian Serb republic 
were "persistent in the struggle for peace," but that they will 
"surely and successfully defend Serb territories and interests 
until peace is achieved."

  [Excerpts] Madeleine Albright, U.S. permanent 
representative to the United Nations, arrived today on a 
three-day visit to Croatia. Mrs. Albright is the highest ranking 
U.S. official to visit Croatia so far. 
  Madeleine Albright's visit to Zagreb is the beginning of her 
European tour that will take her to 13 countries, mostly those 
that embarked on the road to democracy as a result of the fall 
of communism in the East. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin Albright recording] The conflict in this region has 
no 
justification. Aggression cannot be justified. War crimes 
cannot be justified. Blocking humanitarian aid convoys cannot 
be justified. It is time to stop the excuses and start making 
good on many of the unfulfilled promises. 
  Second, the United States has supported and will continue to 
support the territorial integrity of the Republic of Croatia. 
At the same time, the United States will continue to insist on 
a peaceful, nonmilitary resolution of the problems of Croatia's 
occupied territories and full respect for the rights and dignity 
of all citizens of Croatia regardless of national identity. [end 
recording] 
  [Announcer] In a brief meeting with the press, the U.S. 
envoy 
answered several questions. Among other things, she explained 
what will be done regarding the incessant Serb attacks on 
Sarajevo. The United States is aware of what is going on there 
and is monitoring the situation with concern. 
  Should the Blue Helmets' role be altered from protecting the 
peace to imposing peace? The reply was that UN soldiers should 
continue performing their duties as they have been doing so far. 
[passage omitted] 
  After the meeting with reporters, Madeleine Albright and the 
John Shattuck, assistant human rights adviser to the secretary 
of state, visited the U.S. military hospital at Pleso where 150 
members of the U.S. Air Force are currently working. According 
to her schedule, the U.S. envoy will visit Vukovar tomorrow. 
  [Begin Albright recording] It is very important for me as a 
representative of the United States and as a member of the 
Security Council to be able to see Vukovar and to be able to see 
the mass graves there. I think this is something that we are 
very concerned about and I hope very much that there will be 
clear access for us. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] The U.S. envoy is scheduled to be received by 
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Report by Stanislava Medic-Antelj] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, Jan 5 (TANJUG) -- The chief objective of 
the Yugoslav government this year is to radically reduce 
inflation which, owing to the stringent sanctions imposed by the 
U.N., reached a monthly rate of one million percent last 
December. The package of economic measures adopted on December 
30 envisages a much more restrictive monetary policy, TANJUG 
learns. 
  Though the printing presses are operating at top capacity, 
churning out 1.6 million banknotes a day, the mint cannot meet 
the demand for cash money. An ever-increasing amount of 
banknotes is needed to buy an ever-decreasing quantity of goods. 
  The government aims to substantially cut public spending and 
procure more revenue from sources such as taxation. Tax 
benefits will be abolished and payments to employees in kind 
banned. The average net wage this year is projected at 55 U.S. 
dollars. 
  Owing to the rigorous sanctions imposed in late May 1992, 
the 
vast majority of Yugoslavs are living below the poverty line and 
are short of many essentials, including medicines. 
  A recent survey showed that around 75 percent of industrial 
facilities have ground to a halt because of the lack of fuel, 
raw materials and semi-manufactures. 
  One of the anti-inflationary measures whose implementation 
will start in the first half of the year is easing the tax 
burden on the economy by shifting the responsibility for social 
welfare from companies to the state. In addition, some 300,000 
people who are currently on forced leave will lose their jobs 
and receive unemployment benefits from the state. 
  The federal government estimates that implementation of 
these 
measures will result in a drop in industrial production in the 
first half of the year, after which it would pick up and record 
a 6.7 percent growth in the third quarter. The GNP is projected 
to increase 6 percent. 
  The government said easing of the sanctions and unblocking 
of 
Yugoslavia's assets in foreign banks were preconditions for 
cutting back the inflation rate. 
  Late last year, Prime Minister Radoje Kontic addressed a 
request to this effect to the International Monetary Fund, World 
Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

<F P=106> [Article by Sylwester Walczak in New York, Ewa Szymanska in </F>
Washington, T.T.S. and Wojciech Pomianowski in Berlin, and 
Krystyna Grzybowska in Bonn: "Fever Before 
Summit--USA-NATO-Central Europe"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Will Clinton Manage To Convince Walesa? </H5>
  Whether President Bill Clinton will score a success during 
his European trip will depend on whether he manages to convince 
the leaders of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary about his 
"Partnership for Peace" proposal--that, according to the Tuesday 
[4 January] edition of THE NEW YORK TIMES. If he does manage to 
convince them, everyone will be satisfied; if not, then, 
according to THE WASHINGTON POST, the U.S. President will find 
himself in a troublesome situation. 
  THE WASHINGTON POST also pointed to Walesa's and Havel's 
skepticism with regard to "Partnership for Peace." "There is 
nothing good about it," the Polish president said, and he also 
announced that he will demand security guarantees from NATO 
within the next six months. THE NEW YORK TIMES pointed to a 
precondition set by Foreign Minister Olechowski that has to be 
met before Poland joins "Partnership for Peace": a clear 
expression of the goal--that is, acceptance by NATO of new 
members and also of the criteria the candidate countries must 
meet. According to U.S. Ambassador to NATO Robert Hunter, 
Olechowski's preconditions will be met. At the same time, U.S. 
diplomats have been making assurances that "Partnership for 
Peace" does not mean a "new Yalta." 
  In the same issue of THE WASHINGTON POST, commentator Jim 
Hoagland notes that, even though during the Brussels summit the 
United States should redefine its leadership role with regard to 
its NATO partners, which was so clear during the Cold War, one 
should not require that the United States solve European 
problems, such as the conflict in Bosnia, for example. But, 
after all, what could one expect from Washington if Marshal Tito 
himself said that Yugoslavia would fall apart after his death? 
Richard Cohen writes in an article right next to the previous 
one. The message from both articles is unanimous: U.S. 
leadership will never be a cure-all for all of the problems of 
Europe and the world. 
  Is the United States turning its back on the Old Continent 
and heading toward Asia? The administration denies that, while 
stressing that President Clinton will visit Europe as many as 
four times this year: during the NATO summit, on the 50th 
anniversary of the Allied landing in Normandy, during the July 
G-7 summit in Naples, and, in the fall, on the occasion of the 
summit of the CSCE, which will take place in Hungary. Europe is 
waiting to see what kind of a vision of its future and of U.S. 
involvement on the Old Continent Bill Clinton will suggest, Jim 
Hoagland says at the end. 
<H5>  Meeting in Milwaukee </H5>
  This coming Thursday, President Bill Clinton will meet 
Polish, Czech, Hungarian, and Slovak Americans in Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin. Members of the White House Security Council scheduled 
a dinner with so-called leaders of ethnic communities for 
Wednesday. 
  The highlight of the Milwaukee events will be the 
president's 
speech on the occasion of his European trip. According to White 
House Spokesperson Dee Dee Myers, Clinton will be trying to 
convince the American nation about the need for continued active 
involvement in European security issues. 
  The "Partnership for Peace" proposal aroused great anxiety 
among Americans from Central Europe. A flood of phone calls to 
the White House and letters to the president were initiated as 
part of a Coalition of Central European Countries, in which 
appeals are being made to the President to take into account the 
security requirements of Central European countries. The appeals 
point to potential dangers stemming from leaving Central Europe 
in a gray area. 
  A special phone line was launched in mid-December, through 
which one can send a telegram to the White House with a 
ready-made text, in which a postulate is made of accepting 
Poland as a NATO member. The Polish community availed itself of 
this modern type of lobbying. It seems that the meeting in 
Milwaukee is a result of the campaign and also a victory by the 
Polish ethnic group, which, up to now, was regarded as 
politically passive. 
<H5>  Walesa: West's Desertion </H5>
  In an interview with BBC Radio, President Lech Walesa 
accused 
Western countries of having left Central Europe to its own fate. 
He said the West acted in a hesitant manner and rescinded its 
earlier promises of accepting Central European countries into 
NATO because Russia had spoken out against it. 
  "Boris Yeltsin sensed the West's indecision and selfishness, 
and that is why he set preconditions," the president said. "But 
he set these preconditions not on Poland at all but on NATO. 
Meanwhile, the West is acting as if it could not see that at 
all. What are Western countries afraid of when Russia approves 
of the principles of pluralism and democracy and wants to 
establish them?" Lech Walesa asks. "Are they afraid of a vacuum 
being created? That is not just a simple fear; that is 
desertion." 

<H5>    Markus Meckel: Need for Binding Commitment </H5>
  "We need a binding commitment and a time frame for Polish 
membership in NATO," Markus Meckel told RZECZPOSPOLITA. He is 
the leader of the Polish group in the Social Democratic Party 
faction in the German Bundestag and the last foreign minister of 
the German Democratic Republic. 
  According to Meckel, the democratic and stable development 
of 
the countries of Central and East Europe and their integration 
into Western organizations--into the European Union and NATO, 
among others--is in the interest of the West and all of Europe. 
Meckel said the desire by Poland, Hungary, and the Czech 
Republic to be members of NATO is understandable and logical, 
especially against the backdrop of the dangers that have 
recently emerged in Russia. The way the West should respond to 
the Russian events is to link the countries of Central and East 
Europe to the West as soon as possible, including in the area of 
security policy. Meckel also said that fears expressed by Poland 
and other countries of the region of the vacuum of a buffer zone 
or even of a "new Yalta" are realistic, while the way the West 
has been handling Russia is questionable. He thinks that NATO 
should present Russia with an offer of cooperation, but, at the 
same time, it should provide security guarantees to countries in 
Central Europe. Meckel perceives a danger of returning to the 
division of the world and thinks that the danger can only be 
eliminated through the West's decisive action, including 
accepting Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic into Western 
security organizations. 
  When could that happen? Not as soon as the countries 
concerned would like to see it, Meckel repeated what Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel said during a visit to Bonn by Polish 
Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski. What does that mean? "If 
Germans say: `Not so fast,'" Meckel said, "that means we will 
need quite some time in which to convince our West European and 
U.S. friends that integration by Poland and other countries is 
in our mutual interest and that it will contribute to the 
stabilization of Europe." According to Meckel, a specific 
promise or a time frame for Poland and its partners (or an offer 
of cooperation for Russia) will not be decided at the next NATO 
summit mainly because of the position adopted by the Americans, 
but also due to the British position. What is more 
realistic--and the Germans should insist on accomplishing 
that--is that an unambiguous declaration will be made that 
"Partnership for Peace" not only does not exclude Polish, 
Hungarian, and Czech membership in NATO, but it also constitutes 
a first and binding step toward integrating these countries. 
<H5>  Nobody Isolates Russia </H5>
  On Tuesday, which was a day after Foreign Minister Andrzej 
Olechowski's visit to Bonn and a few days before the NATO summit 
meeting in Brussels, an article appeared in DIE WELT entitled 
"NATO and a New East" and written by three well-known political 
scientists--Timothy Garton Ash of Oxford University; Michael 
Mertes, who is an associate of the Chancellor's Office; and 
Dominique Moisi, deputy director of the Paris-based 
International Relations Institute and deputy editor in chief of 
the POLITIQUE ETRANGERE ("Foreign Policy") journal. 
  The authors express their conviction that, despite the 
success by the Russian extreme right wing, there are still 
chances for democratic transformations. This is even more reason 
for the West to support the democratic camp against the fascist 
forces. The results of the Russian elections spurred a debate on 
the efforts of the countries of Central Europe toward 
integration. There are views that accepting Poland, the Czech 
and Slovak Republics, and Hungary as NATO members could cause a 
negative response by Russia and, as a result, could lead to a 
weakening of the pro-Western and democratic front present in 
Russia. 
  Ash, Mertes, and Moisi regard these arguments as not very 
convincing. Russia's uncertain future makes its neighbors' 
nervousness completely understandable. But could acceptance of 
the democratic countries of Central Europe be falsely 
interpreted as designed to isolate Russia? The article says no, 
on the condition that these countries' membership in NATO will 
take place at the same time as some efforts aimed at 
establishing a special "security partnership" with Russia. 
  The article's authors think that the countries of Central 
Europe should be offered an "engagement" to NATO, which would 
open up the prospect of a subsequent marriage. They suggested 
three stages: During the first stage, countries of Central 
Europe would participate in political consultations and in 
NATO's parliamentary meetings; in the second stage, the 
countries' Armed Forces would participate in NATO peace missions 
under the protectorate of the United Nations or the CSCE; and, 
in the third and final stage, they would receive complete 
security guarantees in accordance with Article 5 of the 
Washington treaty. On Tuesday, the German press issued extensive 
reports on the talks in Bonn between Ministers Olechowski and 
Kinkel. Particular emphasis was placed on Poland's justified 
concern over the developments in Russia. The papers cited a 
statement made by Friedbert Pfluger, a defense expert from 
Germany's Christian Democratic Union, who demands an associate 
membership in NATO for countries of Central Europe.

<F P=106> [Interview with UP Sejm Deputy Ryszard Bugaj by Jan Bazyl </F>
Lipszyc; place and date not given: "Lack of a Broader Concept"] 
  [Text] [Lipszyc] After the Sejm speech of Prime Minister 
Pawlak, you said that the Union of Labor [UP] could not support 
a budget that is a continuation of its predecessors. Are you 
going to vote against the bill that has been submitted in the 
Sejm? If you are, why? 
  [Bugaj] We have not discussed this yet; however, I believe 
that we really could not support such a budget. After the prime 
minister's statement, I said that we would try to work on the 
budget, to look for a formula that would be acceptable. The 
version that we received includes some insignificant changes, 
but they do not correspond to the possibilities offered by the 
state's finances. 
  If we believe these estimates, then, for the first time, the 
drop in the budget's revenues is supposed to be curbed; it is a 
certain effort to increase those revenues. The only thing is, it 
is a pity that it is supposed to be done at the cost of 
middle-class taxpayers. This could have been done differently. 
  We have three kinds of urgent needs: social expenditures 
(Minister Leszek Miller speaks about minimum amounts of money 
that he needs--for example, for social care, which is quite a 
lot); considerable aid for the restructuring of industry (the 
budget earmarks proverbial peanuts for that), and the Army 
because the international situation is quite complex. If we 
realize what a dramatic situation is caused by these shortages, 
we should look for the money, even if we were to take 
controversial measures. 
  [Lipszyc] If I understood you correctly, you believe that we 
need several dozen trillion zlotys [Z] more. 
  [Bugaj] I suppose that it is a sum in the area of Z30-50 
trillion. 
  [Lipszyc] How can the budget receive additional money, and 
why did neither this government nor its predecessors take 
advantage of such a possibility? 
  [Bugaj] I cannot really answer the second part of that 
question. I think we could have greater revenues from excise 
taxes; they could yield even more than a dozen trillion zlotys. 
  [Lipszyc] Some people are surprised that the government 
predicts fuel price raises that are supposed to be lower than 
the inflation level. I gather that you are equally surprised. 
  [Bugaj] I certainly am. The excise also comprises some 
luxury 
goods; however, what we must bear in mind is the demand barrier. 
Nevertheless, in my opinion, we are separated from this barrier 
by a few trillion zlotys that could be collected. There will be 
no revolution because of higher vodka and cigarette prices. 
  Another issue is the maximum VAT [value-added tax] rate. It 
is quite high, but not the highest. The previous government 
proposed that VAT rates on energy carriers be raised.... 
  [Lipszyc] And it was rejected by the opposition, including 
UP. 
  [Bugaj] And rightly so. What we could consider, however, is 
the idea of raising the average rate by one point, or even a 
little less. This would not threaten to fuel inflation; it would 
charge everyone just a little in this difficult situation. Now, 
the third issue: We could take some money from well-off citizens 
for future privatization. It would be some kind of a 
privatization loan. As a result of this, people would buy fewer 
imported luxury goods because such an operation would take some 
of their money away from them. 
  Another thing that could be done is introducing a small 
Treasury fee for crossing the border. It would have to be small 
enough--for example, Z100,000. It could not greatly affect the 
costs of those who cross the border once a year; however, it 
would have to be quite a sum for those who cross the border many 
times, doing things that are not really favorable to Poland. 
  [Lipszyc] Why, then, did neither the previous authorities 
nor 
the present ones reach for those revenues, even though they 
differ from each other so much? 
  [Bugaj] I think I am close to the banal conclusion that all 
of the budgets of the past four years were prepared by Minister 
Misiag; therefore, what is confined by his imagination also 
determines the imagination of the government. 
  I have said enough about revenues. Now let us talk about the 
size of the deficit. There is one argument of the opponents of a 
big deficit, and it cannot be underestimated: the problem of the 
increasing domestic debt. However, to an insignificant extent, 
we could afford to do what Leszek Balcerowicz did in 1991--that 
is, to monetize the deficit, certainly on a much smaller scale. 
  [Lipszyc] This means the Central Bank printing money. What 
about the danger of increasing inflation? 
  [Bugaj] In 1991, the budget deficit increased, whereas 
inflation decreased. Those who speak about a close correlation 
between inflation and the deficit in the Polish circumstances 
must be hard pressed to explain it when they compare these data. 
This is not such a simple interdependence. 
  We can afford to slacken financial policy a little bit, 
keeping our foot on the brake pedal. This is the last moment 
because there is still a chance to start a simple production 
increase. It is the last moment because the wealth of 
enterprises is undergoing decapitalization, and, in two or three 
years' time, money will have to be invested to increase 
production. 
  [Lipszyc] Can the budget, as proposed by the government, be 
implemented at all? 
  [Bugaj] I do not feel up to answering this question right 
now. I warned that last year's budget was underestimated as far 
as revenues were concerned, and I was right. However, I said 
that after I checked various data and after some things were 
explained to me by the finance minister. Now I have some doubts. 
However, I must find out more about it. For example, what is the 
chance that investment facilitations will result in a 
considerable increase in investments, which quasi-popiwek [tax 
on excessive wage increases] measures the government wants to 
introduce. 
  The materials we received take up more than 500 pages; 
however, the key issues are described only in general terms. For 
example, what is the government's concept, what is the 
calculation of the global demand for domestic products? 
  [Lipszyc] What is this budget like, then? Is it once again 
the result of compromises and pulling a small blanket in all 
directions? 
  [Bugaj] It was prepared not as a result of adopting some 
kind 
of an economic policy; it is the result of the demands of the 
various ministries, which have their needs and fixed 
expenditures, as well as the result of the efforts of the 
finance minister, who warded off any attempt to increase 
expenditures. 
  The most horrible addition to the budget is the annex on 
privatization. I have not seen such a nuisance for quite a long 
time. There is nothing there that can serve as a good argument. 
  Thus, the budget bill is the result of the lack of a broader 
concept; it is the effect of looking only at tomorrow, without 
trying to show what may happen until the end of the year. 
  [Lipszyc] UP would like to make solid changes in the bill in 
the Sejm. Is this possible? 
  [Bugaj] We will propose that individual problems be 
discussed. If the government agrees, we will be able to do some 
real work. If it turns out that there is no chance to make any 
substantial corrections, we should vote against the budget. Let 
it be the budget of the government and that is that. 
  [Lipszyc] Can the coalition fall apart because of the 
budget? 
  [Bugaj] I do not think so. The coalition realizes that the 
self-government elections will be held in the spring. Now, the 
tactics of the deputies of the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement 
lies in the following: Make a lot of noise, but back out at the 
most important moment. I would like the coalition to crack: If 
it gets rid of the liberal wing, it will offer a possibility of 
carrying out a little different policy and of introducing more 
radical changes. Then we could support the coalition more 
strongly, which we cannot do now. However, the time for that has 
not yet come. It must turn out first that the optimism 
concerning the economic prospects within the policy of 
continuation is not really justified.

<F P=106> [Article by Wielowieyska: "Walesa Straight From the </F>
Belweder?"] 
  [Excerpts] The president wants to expand his authority as 
much as possible and dreams of a long presidential term. But his 
grades are falling. According to a survey by Demoskop, only 1 
percent of the population views his work as very good. This poor 
assessment is largely because of his latest moves, such as the 
business with Major Hodysz [chief of the General Staff, forced 
by Walesa to resign], his attempt to influence the selection of 
the new television chief, and the withdrawal of his support for 
members of the Radio and Television Council, whom he himself 
once recommended. However, there is no doubt that the Belweder 
is the left wing's next objective. 
  Traditionally, the president is self-assured. When he paid a 
visit to the offices of SZTANDAR MLODYCH, he was asked about 
Kwasniewski. His reply was: "Kwasniewski is a good and capable 
politician, but he stands no chance against me. He might become 
president in seven year's time. Before then, it is not even 
worth trying." 
  But one should not be too sure about that. Walesa has lost 
his greatest trump card. He has ceased to be a capable 
politician. It seems that things have gone so far that, if 
Kwasniewski and Walesa were to compete against each other in the 
next presidential election, the Solidarity electorate would stay 
at home. A part of it might even vote for Kwasniewski. 
  According to the latest surveys, from the middle of 
December, 
Walesa is only liked by some 25 percent of the population. Only 
1 percent consider his work very good. Sixty-three percent 
consider it bad or very bad. Only 22 percent approve of his work 
ethic. Sixty percent of the respondents even admitted that they 
sometimes feel ashamed of their president. Sociologists claim 
that this negative feeling has exited for many months. 
  These surveys illustrate the miserable condition of the 
Belweder camp, whose prestige has fallen even further as a 
result of the poor election performance of the Non-Party Bloc in 
Support of Reforms [BBWR]. "There would have to be a miracle for 
Walesa to win an election now," one moderate right-wing 
politician told me. 
  During the time of his greatness, Walesa surrounded himself 
with people of various political colors. He listened to various 
opinions and assessments, after which he reached decisions on 
the basis of a careful examination of the best suggestions. 
During the presidential campaign, he began to listen to people 
from only one political category; he began to make use of the 
ideas of the Center Accord's Jaroslaw Kaczynski. Whatever one 
might accuse Walesa of during this period, one cannot accuse him 
of lacking effectiveness. Today, there is no one who could 
suggest to Walesa some long-term plan of action, no one to 
create a good image for the office of president, no one to warn 
Walesa of the consequences of his actions. One can see this 
deficiency all too clearly. 
  Three years into Walesa's presidency, what has happened to 
his widely publicized political concepts, his promises of a new 
beginning and 100 million zlotys for every Pole, his idea of an 
EEC-2 and a NATO-2? Nothing but empty words. 
  Political oratory has dropped to an appalling level. These 
days, Prime Minister Pawlak is merely repeating Walesa's 
well-worn cliches about Poland being on the edge of the abyss 
and like a car with bad brakes. 
  Walesa himself is behaving as if he has lost touch with 
reality, seemingly oblivious to the fact that he is being 
assessed by public opinion just like any other politician. Did 
anyone tell him that recalling Maj. Hodysz could cost him many 
votes in the next election? 
  The president has very few people of his own. The result of 
this is that one person occupies several posts. Jerzy Milewski 
occupies no less than three managerial armchairs at the same 
time--in the Defense Ministry, the National Security Office, and 
the Presidential Chancellery. This is a violation of the 
Constitution, but that does not matter to the president. What 
matters to him is that he has someone from his entourage exactly 
where he needs him. 
  Walesa still creates the impression that he discovers for 
the 
press what the powers of the president are. 
  The 11 presidential advisory councils contain a total of 
several hundred people--"experts." Yet, somehow, the president 
is reluctant to use their suggestions. He ignored his very own 
Culture Council when it protested against the appointment of his 
candidates to the Radio and Television Committee. [passage 
omitted] 
  With the passage of time, the ex-Solidarity politicians have 
lost the flexibility and their ability to overcome their 
divisions for the sake of the common cause. As a result, the 
only "certain" competitors in a presidential struggle are Walesa 
and a strong left-wing candidate, probably Kwasniewski, to whom 
the presidential post is the logical culmination of his meteoric 
political career. 
  Three years into his presidency, Walesa can be sure that no 
one will deprive him of his place in history. But it looks as if 
he is finished. He will not be able to effectively oppose a 
candidate from the left wing. But, will the former Solidarity 
camp, if it still exists, realize this in good time?

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksander Kwasniewski, chairman of the </F>
National Assembly Constitutional Commission, by correspondent 
Marek Burczyk; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Burczyk] We have heard voices denying the authority 
of the current parliament to promulgate a new constitution. 
Hanna Suchocka and Olga Krzyzanowska spoke about 
"unrepresentative" parliament. Jan Lopuszanski has threatened to 
"organize civil resistance if parliament, which is dominated by 
the left-wing orientation, attempts to approve a new 
constitution." What is your opinion on this subject? 
  [Kwasniewski] I believe that such views represent a serious 
misunderstanding. In a situation where the current parliament 
was called into being through a fully democratic election 
procedure, after the Supreme Court confirmed the validity of 
that election, it is simply irresponsible to say such things. In 
any case, attempts to undermine the representative nature of the 
present parliament are quite senseless. The method used could be 
applied to question the validity of any parliament: After all, 
there will always be a side that has lost.... In my opinion, our 
present parliament, which is fully representative and which was 
democratically elected not only is perfectly competent to draft 
and promulgate a new constitution, it also carries a civic duty 
and a social mandate to carry out that task. 
  [Burczyk] You sometimes talk about the need to create "a 
constitution based on a civic compromise." What exactly do you 
have in mind? 
  [Kwasniewski] The question of the drafting of a new 
constitution has been for many years, as it were, the 
battleground of two opposing concepts. One of these maintains 
that a constitution should be a more homogenous and politically 
unequivocal legal act, while the other concept--created, 
incidentally, by 19-century thinker Lassalle, who was a social 
democrat (though that fact should not be held against 
him)--assumes that a constitution should be based on a social 
compromise. I am an advocate of the second concept. I believe 
that the fundamental legal act should reconcile the different 
beliefs, philosophies, and options preferred by society. This 
goal cannot, of course, be realized in its entirety, but the 
creation of a constitution should in any case be conducted 
through dialogue with, ideally, the widest spectrum of Polish 
society, through discussion and compromise. 
  [Burczyk] Representatives of your political group [Social 
Democracy of the Polish Republic, which is a component of the 
Democratic Left Alliance; Kwasniewski is chairman of both] 
declare that they will listen even to extraparliamentary 
opposition's opinion on the projected new constitution at its 
drafting stage. How do you see such cooperation in practical 
application, inasmuch as, formally and legally, 
extraparliamentary opposition is not entitled to have a say in 
the drafting of the fundamental law? 
  [Kwasniewski] Well, we have to accept that 
extraparliamentary 
opposition operates outside parliamentary channels and that 
certain consequences follow from that.... Nevertheless, we still 
maintain that even groups such as that should be presented with 
individual projects so that their opinions could be obtained. In 
my opinion, a special forum should be created for that purpose. 
  [Burczyk] So far, there has been little positive response to 
your proposals. On the contrary, you can hear critical voices 
even from the "extraparliamentarians," who do not particularly 
want to lend their names to something on which in the end they 
will not have a say in any case. They do not wish to play the 
role of a fig leaf.... 
  [Kwasniewski] We will not spell out our specific offer to 
them until our commission has determined the pragmatic framework 
of our task. So far, we have only outlined our intentions to 
them, and you can hardly expect anyone to formulate their 
opinion about someone's unspecified intentions.... I remain 
moderately optimistic on that question. This is because I 
believe that sensible extraparliamentary groups will come to 
appreciate that it is better to be in the know than to be in the 
dark; better to have some influence on what happens than not to 
have any at all. 
  [Burczyk] Minister Drzycimski said recently: "A constitution 
opens up a new battlefront for the coalition, but the coalition 
is not interested in such a front." In this way, he indicated, 
as it were, that he was hoping that the whole process of 
drafting and introducing the constitution would be actively 
checked by the government coalition.... 
  [Kwasniewski] As far as I am concerned, I want exactly the 
opposite kind of action. I am an advocate of quick moves. After 
four years of improvised democracy, it is high time to create a 
stable framework for the state's sociopolitical system. I 
believe that we should include the introduction of a new 
constitution in the proposed timetable of major political events 
in Poland scheduled for the immediate future. If the local 
self-government elections are to take place in the spring of 
1994 and the next presidential election is scheduled for the 
fall of 1995, then, by the end of next year, we should prepare 
the final draft of the new constitution, and, by the spring of 
the following year, that fundamental law must be approved by 
parliament and then confirmed in a referendum. 
  [Burczyk] Do you share the opinion that, once it has 
approved 
the constitution, parliament should be dissolved and a new 
election should take place? 
  [Kwasniewski] No, I do not agree with it. This is because I 
believe that stability is one of the most important elements in 
Poland's political life today. That is why we have been and 
still are in favor of carrying out the local self-government 
elections according to the time schedule, running the 
presidential election on time, and organizing the parliamentary 
election according to the proposed timetable. If we succeed in 
promulgating the new constitution according to our plans--that 
is, not a constitution of the victorious camp but a constitution 
of civic compromise--and if we manage to stick to the planned 
calendar of individual elections, political reality in Poland 
will have a much better chance of becoming more easily 
predictable. Is that not an exciting and worthwhile prospect and 
one that deserves all of our effort? 
  [Burczyk] As regards the referendum on the proposed 
constitution, there are two concepts to choose from. According 
to the first of these, the referendum will approve (or refuse to 
approve) the constitution after the latter has been accepted by 
the National Assembly. According to the second concept, the 
referendum should be held before the passing of the constitution 
by the National Assembly; in this way, some of the most 
controversial questions concerning the sociopolitical system 
could be resolved, as it were, while the constitution is still 
"on the stocks." Which of these options are you prepared to 
support? 
  [Kwasniewski] One thing is beyond question here: The actual 
text of the constitution should be approved in a general 
national referendum. As regards the other type of referendum and 
the question of whether it should have the power of final 
acceptance or just fragmentary acceptance, the problem is 
slightly more complex. This solution has its advantages, but it 
also has serious legal and practical drawbacks. Perhaps it would 
simplify the resolution of certain questions--such as, for 
example, the nature of state-church relations, or the extent of 
social rights safeguarded by the Constitution. On the other 
hand, what should we do if the referendum turnout turned out to 
be very low, and the votes were distributed in an unfortunate 
way, making it hard to interpret them unequivocally as the 
expression of the will of the people? The concept of a 
fragmentary-acceptance referendum requires much more careful 
analysis and consideration.

<F P=106> [Interview with Andrzej Drzycimski, press spokesman for </F>
President Lech Walesa, by Andrzej Woyciechowski at the Radio Zet 
studio in Warsaw on the "Guest of Radio Zet" program--live] 
  [Text] [Woyciechowski] Radio Zet's guest today is Minister 
Andrzej Drzycimski--good morning to you. 
  [Drzycimski] Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 
  [Woyciechowski] What is new at the Belvedere? 
  [Drzycimski] I think it is raining outside. 
  [Woyciechowski] Yes, that is unusual for this time of year. 
  The press has been writing a lot for the past few 
days--actually, for the past few weeks, but, in the past few 
days, more has been written about it, as it were, and in a more 
nervous manner--about the issue of appointing deputy ministers 
in the so-called presidential ministries--that is, the Defense 
Ministry [MON], the Internal Affairs Ministry [MSW], and the 
Foreign Ministry. The press reports today that Kwasniewski is 
supposed to meet Pawlak, who will make a decision on whether to 
appoint the deputy ministers. Meanwhile, press commentaries 
speak of the president being absolutely opposed to having 
coalition candidates appointed as deputy ministers. Would you... 
  [Drzycimski] If I could just make a minor comment here. The 
president has spoken out on the issue many times already, so let 
me just remind you of what the president has already said, and 
he upholds all that: The president is absolutely against making 
the three ministries political. What does it mean? It means 
that, as it were ex officio, or that we... [Drzycimski changes 
thought] It means that we adopt the principle that coalition 
representatives are included in the three ministries [as 
heard]--that is, because he says that would lead to absurd 
situations, even in the current form, where the coalition has 
just two ingredients. What if we were to have.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You mean like six or seven 
more 
joining in? 
  [Drzycimski] No, but even if we were to see just two more 
ingredients joining the coalition. After all, the coalition can 
possibly widen its scope. So, in that case, we would have in 
these three ministries, which are key to the state's 
functioning, at least four, five, six, or even eight.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Mr. Minister, but is that 
opposition by the president absolute? Is this opposition to the 
principle or [words indistinct] 
  [Drzycimski] Yes, it is his opposition to the principle that 
the coalition kind of automatically introduces.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Introduces their own men? 
Could 
one therefore.... 
  [Drzycimski, interrupting] And why is that? It is because 
those ministries that determine the state's efficient 
functioning would immediately be made political, and even the 
most minor type of conflict within the coalition--that has to be 
said out loud--would immediately have an impact on those 
ministries that must be of a very stable nature. They have to be 
characterized by a high level of peacefulness. They have to work 
for the long term. We cannot have those ministries working for 
immediate goals only. Our experience so far in these three or 
four years.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] These are not very good 
experiences, especially with regard to MON and the MSW. 
  [Drzycimski] These are not very good experiences, and that 
is 
even more reason for the president to.... [pauses] But he also 
adds immediately what he always says: That does not mean that we 
are against anyone who is in fact an expert or who has this or 
that kind of professional expertise or license, or who belongs 
to this or that kind of [word indistinct].... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Do I understand it correctly? 
Could one understand what you are saying to mean that the 
president would not mind having deputy ministers who would just 
happen to be members of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] or the 
Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], as long as the president 
approves of their appointments? Is this whole issue about his 
approval? 
  [Drzycimski] No, it is not. This is not about the president 
insisting on approving anyone. The president avoids speaking out 
on... [Drzycimski changes thought] What he means is the 
principle itself. He will be supporting the ministries' chiefs 
in their efforts to maintain the principle. That is because it 
is a kind of principle that must be clearly defined, or else we 
will be constantly having a situation of a very unstable process 
of cabinet formation--that is one issue. Another is that 
decisions regarding personnel appointments in a ministry are not 
made by the president but by the individual ministry's chief.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That is to say the prime 
minister--I am sorry, I mean the minister--after consulting the 
prime minister? 
  [Drzycimski] Exactly. The president just means the principle 
that he wants to see observed. 
  [Woyciechowski] Does it mean that the prime minister cannot 
make that decision on his own without the consent of [word 
indistinct] minister? 
  [Drzycimski] In theory, he can appoint a minister, but I do 
not think that would be an example to be followed. That would 
rather tend to indicate some kind of tension occurring. 
  [Woyciechowski] From what we know at this stage, [Defense] 
Minister Kolodziejczyk threatens in definite terms that he will 
resign in that situation, but [Internal Affairs] Minister 
Milczanowski says he could possibly agree. We all know that the 
post of deputy minister responsible for the Fire Guard is vacant 
in the MSW. 
  [Drzycimski] There is also a vacancy in MON, and, as far as 
I know, Minister Kolodziejczyk is currently looking for the 
right man, who would like to take up this very important 
ministry. As far as I can recall, someone there is about to 
retire, and there will be a vacancy, except that.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But is he looking for a 
candidate within the PSL and the SLD, or in other places? 
  [Drzycimski] No, he is just looking for the right man, who 
would take upon himself issues that are important in terms of 
being in charge of MON, and that is an open issue. 
  [Woyciechowski] And what about [Foreign] Minister 
Olechowski? 
  [Drzycimski] I am not aware of his making any changes 
whatsoever. As far as I know, there are more important issues on 
the agenda right now.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] In a word--NATO? 
  [Drzycimski] Yes. 
  [Woyciechowski] What will happen during the NATO summit on 
Monday [10 January]? Is there any chance whatsoever of NATO 
changing its position on Poland and of opening itself up more? 
Could that possibly happen during these next few days? 
  [Drzycimski] I think anything could happen, even though I am 
sure some fundamental decisions have already been made. Despite 
that, there were some measures and statements made by Western 
and also U.S. politicians. These are proof of efforts being made 
right now to come up with a [hesitating] safety valve of some 
kind, for the purpose of possible future solutions. A sudden 
trip that is scheduled to take place in the next few days by 
some high-ranking representatives of the U.S. administration is 
also proof of that, as well as some statements made by German 
politicians and also the recent visit by [Foreign] Minister 
Olechowski to Germany. After all, that was the first visit to 
Germany in the New Year, and it is no accident that the German 
foreign minister decided to invite Minister Olechowski and not 
someone else. The purpose was to discuss precisely those issues. 
The president keeps speaking. Some of his recent statements are 
very characteristic here. They are quite widely heard. I think 
that also has an effect in terms of providing information. Too 
often, we have been examining these issues from the standpoint 
of: We do not mean anything. But, in fact, we do. Let us not 
hide ourselves. We are a nation of 40 million people or so. We 
are a European country of medium size, but we are a very 
important stabilizing factor in Europe and the kind of factor 
where the Central European transformations are advanced the 
furthest and where they resulted in some victories, but also, 
naturally, in all kinds of slipups. That is unavoidable. Still, 
we are heading down a path where nobody can accuse us of 
deviating from the main path even a centimeter--I mean the main 
path of striving to achieve democracy, to establish democratic 
structures, and to create a complete basis for a democratic 
country, and also the fact that we have been trying very 
persistently to establish a market economy, which, in the long 
run, creates chances for our becoming a country that is capable 
of joining Europe's normal economic arrangements--I mean Europe 
as a whole. And, on that issue, the president has been saying in 
very outright terms that the views that are being voiced by us 
from Warsaw are full of anxiety: Let us not allow a repetition 
of what happened in the not-very- distant past. Let us not 
forget that.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] The president used very 
ominous 
comparisons in his interview for the BBC yesterday when he made 
analogies to 1939. Is that really the situation now? Is it 
really dangerous? 
  [Drzycimski] By the way, the president has spoken out on 
this 
many times. Let me remind you of the interviews for LA STAMPA 
and THE WASHINGTON POST, yesterday's interview for the BBC--I 
mean, for BBC Television--and also his talks with politicians. 
It is not an issue that occurred this month; it occurred much 
earlier than that. That is because he can see that, in the 
course of this great revolution that was accomplished 
bloodlessly, we managed to break one of the cruelest systems the 
human race ever created. It happened without a war and in a way 
I would describe as outright marvelous. And the Western world, 
which was incredibly interested in the process, the whole world 
was watching attentively to what was happening; one could say, 
metaphorically speaking, that the Berlin Wall was being 
demolished from both sides: On our side and on the West's side. 
And then the Wall crumbled. But we failed to create anything new 
in its place, except one thing: We built a united Germany. But 
there was no structure or vision of the future created or 
suggestions made. What is the result of that? There are 
established what politicians call gray areas or empty fields. So 
we are now, as it were, between two.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Between a united Germany, on 
the one hand, and Zhirinovskiy on the other? 
  [Drzycimski] Not just a united Germany; I would say Europe 
as 
a whole, which decided to take a standstill position that is 
quite comfortable for them, waiting for an outcome of the 
battle. It is not the case that the battle will result in an 
outcome all by itself, or that it will be fought only at a 
roundtable, at which one can conduct debates. In fact, the 
battle will be fought through all kinds of choices that will be 
made and through decisions that the individual nations will 
make. These decisions can vary a great deal; even the Russian 
election results are proof of that. And that is why the 
president says: Let us not repeat the mistake. Moreover, it is 
also a warning addressed to the West against, through its 
avoidance of inconvenience, making the same mistake as the 
politicians of the period between the two World Wars made, as 
well as during World War II--namely, that they were willing to 
come to agreement with one another. 
  [Woyciechowski] In other words, sacrifice Poland, even 
though it may sound cruel? 
  [Drzycimski] That is right. This is why the president uses 
such strong words; it is a warning--a warning that cannot be 
underestimated. Then no one will be able to tell us that we said 
nothing and that we withdrew, as it were. I would like to add 
one more thing: Please note that these words of the president 
are very easily understood in the West. Now, look at our mass 
media; we are now talking about it a few days before the event. 
This is not a problem that arose today. Do we see any serious 
texts in the Polish press, in the Polish mass media, such as 
television or the radio, that are concerned with this problem? 
Everyone, as it were.... [pauses] When the president discusses 
this, in Poland.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Everyone is silent, whereas 
the 
West quotes the president. Mr. Minister, why do you think the 
West is blocking Poland's access to NATO so strongly? Has the 
change of the governing coalition affected this in any way? Or 
perhaps it was the election in Russia and Zhirinovskiy? Or was 
it something else? 
  [Drzycimski] No, no. I mean, the Polish elections probably 
affected this the least. After these few months we can.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] We can see that nothing has 
changed? 
  [Drzycimski] The world became convinced that we are still 
proceeding on this tough road. Incidentally, the president said 
that there would be no changes in the two [word indistinct]: The 
road to democracy and the road to a market economy. The rest may 
be discussed: Should we go more to the right or more to the 
left? The Polish elections also convinced the West that we are 
on the right road and that it is a normal process: Sometimes you 
are closer to this side, sometimes closer to the other side. Of 
course, we also have our own peculiarities. However, generally, 
when someone is observing Poland from the outside.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Did, then, the Russian 
elections and Zhirinovskiy.... [pauses] Did Zhirinovskiy scare 
the West? 
  [Drzycimski] No, the West is simply a little selfish. What 
was achieved in Warsaw during the talks between the two 
presidents, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Polish President 
Lech Walesa, this famous signature under the declaration of both 
presidents, whereby Russia stated that it could see no reason 
that Poland and other countries should not enter NATO.... 
[pauses] In other words, the artificial hindrance was taken 
away.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] However, Yeltsin changed his 
mind later on. 
  [Drzycimski] Yes, he did. Why did he do that? That is very 
simple: Would you not do the same if you felt someone's weak 
spot? Just as in the Leninist rule: Push until you meet some 
resistance. This is the element that appeared; that is, the West 
yielded, as it were, and it decided that Russia could submit its 
conditions. Now, we are asking: To whom is it submitting its 
conditions? To us? We are not afraid. We realize that, for 
Russia, Poland is perhaps one of the elements. The West, being 
richer, is definitely more interesting to Russia. There lies the 
problem that Russia would have to tackle. Thus, the ball has 
been thrown not on our ground but on the ground of the West. It 
is the West and NATO that must answer whether they want it or 
not. If the West answers that it is ready to listen to Russia's 
demands, it means that the 16 states that make up NATO accept 
the dictate that is imposed upon them. 
  Apart from that, if we are talking about partnership, about 
the U.S. "Partnership for Peace" project, which is good, 
interesting, and important, we are prepared to accept it--on one 
condition, however: on the condition that it is followed by 
concrete solutions and that it is not a nebula that we are being 
offered now. This decision must be made independently by the 
NATO states. The decisions, which also seem to be suggested by 
statements of NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner.... 
[pauses] That this pact realizes the historic moment we have 
found ourselves in. The future of Europe will be decided here: 
whether we will strive to recreate the confrontative system or 
attempt to construct a new, open, and uniting Europe. This is 
the question: divisions, the bipolar system, a policy of calling 
up the demons from the past, even the demons of the various 
-isms that Europe has already gone through, such as Stalinism, 
Hitlerism--the former, ice-cold Siberian camps, the latter, 
crematories. These are certain signs that we must not forget. 
  We can argue whether history repeats itself. I am a 
historian, and I can tell you that there are certain trends. 
However, in such moments as the present one, it is a moment that 
is a warning, a challenge, and it forces us to answer the 
following question: What Europe do we want to have--a bipolar 
Europe or a common Europe? We would like a common Europe, a 
Europe that is open, not characterized by enmity, not against 
Russia, and interested in the future as the greatest challenge. 
This is what we are going to bring up in all of the talks, and 
what President Walesa will perhaps discuss with President 
Clinton in Prague. 
  [Woyciechowski] Do commentators wonder whether President 
Walesa will receive on Friday [7 January] Ms. Albright, a 
special envoy of President Clinton, and General Shalikashvili? 
Will he receive them? 
  [Drzycimski] If they arrive in Poland, I believe he.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] If they come to Poland, he 
will 
receive them. Mr. Minister, can we say now that the most 
important issue for Poland today, for the next few months or 
maybe longer, is the issue of Poland's admittance to NATO? Is it 
a fundamental issue? 
  [Drzycimski] Well, we must explain a few things fully. We 
are 
talking about Poland's admission to NATO. This admission will 
not be automatic. It will be a certain process. It will consist 
of certain stages.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You mean political decisions 
that.... 
  [Drzycimski, interrupting] Political decisions. I mean a 
decision that we are in Europe, in Western Europe. This is what 
we want. 
  [Woyciechowski] These are fundamental decisions? 
  [Drzycimski] Yes, these are fundamental decisions. 
  [Woyciechowski] Let us change the subject for a while. Does 
President Walesa know the name of his future rival in the 
presidential elections? Can he guess who it will be? 
  [Drzycimski] President Walesa has not made the decision 
yet.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Whether he himself will run? 
  [Drzycimski] Yes, whether he himself will run. I can say 
that 
he does not know the name of a possible candidate because he is 
not interested in this issue at the moment. He believes that 
something else is important: If this functioning democratic 
system starts to defend itself, if it begins to be efficient, 
then he, as a man of breakthroughs, will complete his mission. 
  [Woyciechowski] And what will he do? Go fishing? 
  [Drzycimski] Yes, he will go fishing. However, if it does 
not 
function, if there appear smaller or greater inefficiencies.... 
[pauses] We do not lack only a constitution; we also do not have 
a fully developed system of the functioning of the state. We 
have created two poles: the legislative pole and the executive 
pole. The Small Constitution resolves these problems. However, 
we still do not have the judiciary pole; this is a basis for 
every democratic state. Even the latest presidential bill on the 
Constitutional Tribunal--that is, on the superiority of the 
tribunal in all decisions.... [pauses] As we know, when both 
parties were in opposition, the bill was supported by them 
wholeheartedly. Now that they.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] What do they want? 
  [Drzycimski] They want to postpone it. There are many such 
elements. These are the fundamental issues, and this is what the 
president focuses his attention on: on building a structural 
system of the state. He wants to resolve the following problem: 
Are we going to build a state of a parliamentary-cabinet nature, 
which we have experienced, and the experiences were not always 
very pleasant? Or are we going to support the idea of stronger 
executive authorities? The president proposes a 
presidential-parliamentary system, with full democratic 
protection mechanisms. This must be clear. The president 
believes that, in such a difficult moment, a difficult moment of 
changing the systems, we will need a strong decisionmaking 
center for a long time. This center must be able to make 
important decisions--not in a peaceful situation. We must look 
at constitutional solutions in the following way: If something 
bad happens, then what? Who will make the decision? 
  In the past three years, we have already seen a few 
situations that required some decisions. I would like to see the 
decisions made in the configuration that we have had so far. I 
fear that there would have been enormous difficulties. 
Therefore, Poland is seen as a stable country, in the external 
sense. Within Poland, we have our own internal misgivings: We 
want this or that to be better. This is a very good point; it 
means that we have not stopped. However, Poland is seen as a 
stable country also because it has a center that makes key 
decisions for the state. We may argue, discuss, tackle all 
subjects; however, when a decision needs to be made, we are 
among those who make it, and we do it courageously. 
  [Drzycimski] There is always someone, Mr. Minister, who can 
recall the prime minister and dissolve the parliament? 
  [Woyciechowski] Well, but I also meant the present 
situation. 
I meant the discussion on the future of NATO. It was the 
president who started this huge debate for Europe, in August of 
this year [as heard]. It was the president who forced the West 
to answer the question of what direction we would go in. It is 
the president who now forces others to answer the following 
question: What kind of Europe do we want to have--a bipolar 
Europe or an open Europe? These are the fundamental 
controversies that perhaps right now seem quite remote and too 
complicated to an ordinary citizen. However, this also entails 
another problem: Will foreign capital come to Poland? If we have 
those political protection mechanisms provided by NATO, we will 
have the guarantee that capital, new technologies, and cultural 
goods will come more readily. An entirely new platform would 
then open up before us. This is the strategy that the president 
has adopted. It is not a strategy for a year or two. Some people 
say that the president is losing popularity. It is not 
popularity like that of Miss Polonia contests. I apologize to my 
colleagues who.... 
  [Drzycimski, interrupting] To your colleague, the prime 
minister's spokesperson? 
  [Woyciechowski] No, that is not what I meant. I meant those 
who deal with these problems. Well, now, we do not participate 
in any contests. The president looks at a strategy that does not 
include just a year or two; it is a long-term strategy. In those 
three years that the president has been in office, we could not 
find any elements that were evident mistakes of the president. 
Even his greatest adversaries could not say that he violated the 
law or that he destroyed the state. They are simply not able to 
say anything like this. They can speak about other matters but 
not these. This proves that, if President Lech Walesa decides to 
run for the office of president again, he has some experience, 
and he can say: This is what I have done. If you want, you can 
accept me. If you do not want to do that, without any apparent 
cause, this will be a decision of the people, just like the 
September elections were a decision of the people. This is the 
ultimate decision. The president, as a man who builds the rules 
of democracy, believes that everyone must submit to such a 
decision, no matter whether he agrees or not. This is a decision 
made in the elections. I only hope that we will all respect such 
rules. 
  [Drzycimski] Thank you, Mr. Minister, for the interview. 
  [Woyciechowski] Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Article by Prime Minister Lyuben Berov: "We Will Return </F>
the Land by the Summer of 1994"] 
  [Text] Recently most critics of the government's 
performance claim that the reforms have evidently "stalled" or 
"stopped." 
  In this respect, the critics usually give first place to the 
land reform. Precisely for this reason, it is necessary to know 
the true situation with the land reform. 
  In contrast to the restitution of property, from which a few 
percent of the town population obtained benefit, the agrarian 
reform affects the overwhelming majority of the Bulgarian 
people, inasmuch as just before and immediately after World War 
II three-quarters of the population obtained their subsistence 
from agriculture, and for this reason were connected either 
directly or through relatives with the ownership of a larger or 
smaller amount of land. It emerges from a special public 
opinion poll commissioned with the National Center for 
Investigating Public Opinion that 69 percent of the population 
expected to regain possession of agricultural land. In rural 
areas, the figure was 92 percent. 
  Information gathered under the Agricultural Land Act also 
indicates a similar picture. 
  Up to November 1993, on the basis of applications submitted 
for the return of land, the land commissions issued 1.93 million 
decisions recognizing ownership titles under Article 18, 
Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Agricultural Land Act, relating to a 
total of 51.06 million decares of land. However, many of the 
decisions made concerned land claimed by two or more heirs, 
because of which a total of over 3 million land claims were 
received. This means that over half of the adult population 
submitted claims. 
  In its program, the government initially announced that it 
would return 80 percent of the agricultural land to which claims 
had been laid by the end of 1993, but as early as in April 1993 
this commitment was adjusted to 55-60 percent, following a 
careful assessment of the real possibilities in this direction. 
The latter figure remains "enshrined" in all the official 
statements issued from the spring until now. 
  These are the results of the government's work in this 
direction to the end of 1993. Up to the end of November 1993, 
ownership titles to agricultural land were restored as follows: 
  -- ownership within existing or restored real boundaries: 
6.59 million decares; 
  -- ownership through a land division plan: 11.73 million 
decares, making a total of 18.32 million decares. 
  To this amount one has to add 11.65 million decares for 
which 
temporary ownership certificates have been issued (in respect to 
claims covering about 70 percent of the recognized land), making 
a grand total of 29.97 million decares. 
  To these figures one has to add the results achieved in 
December 1993, which have still not been properly recorded 
statistically. The probable figure for land restored to its 
owners in December will be around 3.2 million decares, plus 
about 0.3 million decares in respect of which temporary 
ownership has been granted. 
  Thus, in the final analysis, by the end of 1993 about 33.5 
million decares of land was returned to its owners, representing 
65 percent of the land for which claims had been submitted. 
This shows that in general terms the government has fulfilled 
its commitment to restore ownership of "60-65 percent of the 
land." True, the issue of temporary ownership certificates does 
not legally constitute full restoration of land ownership within 
specific (actual) boundaries, but in practice, thanks to the 
work of the land division companies, the owner can already 
cultivate land almost equivalent to the land he claimed and for 
which his claim has been recognized by the appropriate land 
commission. 
  It is true that during the first half of the year the 
implementation of the agrarian reform did not proceed at a 
sufficiently fast rate. Because of this, from July this year 
radical measures were taken to speed up the process. The 
results are self-evident from the chart showing a monthly 
breakdown of the total amounts of land handed over to its owners. 
  [A graphic is appended to the article showing the cumulative 
amounts of land restored to its owners, expressed in millions of 
decares for each month of 1993; the chart shows the approximate 
amounts of land restored in the form of temporary ownership 
certificates, actually restored within real boundaries, and 
granted to the owners under the land division plan. According 
to the chart, in January 1993 approximately 5 million decares 
had been returned in all; by July, approximately 20 million 
decares, and by December over 40 million decares.] 
  This trend indicates that by the summer of 1994 the process 
of returning ownership titles to agricultural land will be 
largely completed. It will still be necessary to complete the 
work in a limited number of villages with specific juridical or 
other problems that are holding up the work, for example due to 
procrastination in adopting court decisions on land boundary 
disputes between villages. A public opinion poll has shown that 
two-thirds of the population approves extending the deadline for 
returning land to June 1994. 
  There are a number of basic causes that delay and hinder 
the process of farmland restoration, including the following: 
  First, one should point out the false sworn declarations on 
land owned prior to the so-called collectivization (making up 
more than half of the false declarations made under oath.) 
These claims relate to more than 3 million decares of land that 
in fact does not exist. For this reason, the claims for 
restoration of land have turned out to cover a greater amount of 
land than actually existed in the land holdings prior to 
collectivization. This especially applies to Burgas, Lovech, 
and Khaskovo Oblasts. The Council of Ministers has submitted a 
bill to the National Assembly to resolve the problem, but 
parliament has yet to debate it. 
  In many populated centers one encounters an organized 
(albeit 
secret) resistance to the land division plans on the part of 
various political forces. Often, this is a result of the 
desires of individual owners to obtain the land due to them in a 
particular locality and no other, desires that cannot be 
reconciled. A further major obstacle that one should mention is 
the fact that in many cases no documentary evidence of title is 
available because the old notarial acts have been lost, because 
documents were deliberately burnt when the owners entered the 
labor collective farms, and so forth. 
  In many populated centers the process is hindered because 
the 
boundaries between the agricultural and forest lands have not 
been established. In many cases concerning the return of 
ecologically polluted lands, the work of the land commissions is 
hampered by the absence of a concrete assessment by other organs 
of the form and extent of the pollution (which governs what 
crops may be sown and the conditions under which the land in 
question may be restored to the owners). 
  Major obstacles are being encountered in connection with the 
granting of state lands as compensation for other land or to 
landless peasants, as the law prescribes. The state land 
amounts only to 2.27 million decares (0.5 million decares of 
which is uncultivated land or pasture) and is extremely unevenly 
distributed, mainly in northeast Bulgaria, Plovdiv and Khaskovo 
districts, and elsewhere. Most of this land has been left for 
the liquidation councils to dispose of. 
  The problem of the liquidation councils and the completion 
of 
their work is still unresolved. Of a total of 2,067 liquidation 
councils throughout the country, only 257 will complete their 
work by 31 December. Of the remaining 1,810 councils, 1,322 
have already finished defining the land shares under Article 27, 
Paragraph 1 of the act, but only 195 have finished apportioning 
the land and property in real terms. 
  Among the major objective reasons delaying the liquidation 
process, one should mention unresolved property lawsuits 
involving the former labor collective farms or the liquidation 
councils, the failure to complete financial audits, dues 
uncollected from various natural or juridical persons amounting 
to a total of 1.58 billion leva, the existence of stores of 
unusable plant protection agents and stocks of animals suffering 
from tuberculosis and leucosis, the failure of municipal land 
commissions to supply necessary information, and so on. In the 
case of 291 councils, the title holders do not want to receive 
the shares of property that are their due. Difficulties also 
arise from the fact that almost three- quarters of the 
liquidation councils have to continue production activities 
(spring sowing, harvesting) on a smaller or larger part of their 
land holdings. 
  The coin of the agrarian reform also has a reverse side. 
This is the extensive fragmentation of land ownership and 
agricultural production that will ensue in the initial period 
and will hamper the competitiveness of our new agriculture 
(especially in the production of grain and certain industrial 
crops). Available data on land already returned to its owners 
confirm that most holdings range between 15 and 20 decares. Few 
holdings are more than 50 decares in area, and very few above 
100 decares. One-fourth of the title holders are receiving back 
less than 10 decares, and many of these are receiving only one 
or two decares. On a plot of 5-10 decares one can, for example, 
cultivate a decent vegetable garden, but it is impossible to 
develop competitive production of wheat, sugar beet, sunflowers, 
and so on. 
  Several ways of overcoming the fragmentation of land 
ownership and agrarian production are possible. 
  The first is related to the sporadic concentration of 
ownership along the purchases-sales line. The historical 
practice in our state shows that we cannot rely on this (at 
least as far as the rapid and radical solution of the issue is 
possible). During the period of 1897-1911 the degree of 
concentration of the land ownership in Bulgaria preserved an 
almost constant level. During the period of 1920-1945 a clear 
process related to a significant fragmentation of the agrarian 
property and production emerged. Now we restore this 
fragmentation. 
  The second possible way is related to leasing the land. 
  This is especially important when one takes into 
consideration that about 45 percent of the new owners (mostly 
inheritors) are living in the cities and do not intend to 
cultivate the land they are entitled to by themselves. Major 
leased farms, cultivating up to several thousand decares of 
land, could emerge under those conditions. So far about 10 such 
farms have been created, but they are not a mass phenomenon and 
will not become such a phenomenon, because of the temporary and 
unstable character of their basis. In addition, it is very 
difficult to merge a large number of scattered agrarian plots 
into a single mechanical service bloc, among other things, 
because those plots must have a common border. 
  The third way involves the establishments of owners' 
cooperatives, but the aforementioned difficulty (lack of a 
common border) applies also to this category. In addition, the 
owners who unite in a cooperative often do not posses the 
necessary ownership documents in which the precise borders of 
their plots are listed. 
  A draft bill on the cadastre has been submitted to the 
parliament. This draft bill will help those who want to 
cultivate their plots together, to receive neighboring plots 
when the agrarian land is divided, within specific and real 
borders. However, this still is a matter of the future. So far 
in the country 1,200 cooperatives have been registered. They 
have a total of 7.2 million decares of land and 268,000 
participants. Their total share of cultivated land is 
substantially higher than the 13 percent they formally own, 
because often those cooperatives cultivate more land than they 
own. This is a typical phenomenon in Burgas Oblast. 
  However, the cooperatives issue is a rather politicized 
matter, and this hampers the correct solution of the issue from 
the view point of economic efficiency.

  [Text] On 6 January President Zhelyu Zhelev met 
representatives of the Bulgarian Social Democratic and Green 
Parties. The economic situation in the country, problems with 
structural and agrarian reforms, and the alarming growth in 
unemployment were discussed. Also discussed were issues of 
international importance, including the situation in Yugoslavia 
in particular and in the Balkans in general. 
  After the meeting Stefan Radoslavov, chief secretary of the 
Bulgarian Social Democratic Party, expressed satisfaction with 
the rather similar positions on various issues that were noted. 
  On behalf of the Green Party, Vladimir Sotirov conveyed to 
the president a charter on national unity worked out by Green 
Party experts. 
  President Zhelev also met representatives of the Union of 
Thracian Associations, Internal Macedonian Revolutionary 
Organization-Union of Macedonian Associations, the Initiative 
Committee on Protecting the Rights of Bulgarian Refugees, and 
the Green Party. They demanded that the president utilize his 
influence on the parliament and the cabinet and facilitate the 
solution of the problems of the refugees of the Aegean and 
Thracian Macedonia and the issue of compensating those refugees. 
A petition on this matter was submitted by the four 
organizations on 6 November 1993 to the parliament, and they 
expect a more rapid solution of the issue.

  [Text] Today, after almost four hours of consultations 
among the members of the Chamber of Deputies Standing Bureau and 
the leaders of the parliamentary factions, the Chamber of 
Deputies met in session a short while ago and decided, by 155 
votes to 89, with 13 abstentions, to suspend the extraordinary 
session begun yesterday at the request of 118 opposition 
deputies, our correspondent Ioan David reports. The suspension 
remains valid until the Constitutional Court reaches a decision 
regarding the way in which the chamber passed the draft bill 
empowering the executive to rule by ordinances and contract and 
guarantee foreign loans [during the parliamentary recess]. 
  Also today, at the request of the chamber's Standing Bureau, 
the Chamber of Deputies decided, by 167 votes to 3, with 84 
abstentions, to summon an extraordinary session over 4-13 
January. Among the draft bills scheduled to be discussed during 
that extraordinary session we would like to mention the 
ordinances issued by the government that have not yet been 
passed by parliament, the draft bill on the setting up and 
functioning of the Romanian radio broadcasting company and the 
Romanian television company, the draft bill on Romania's 
national defense, the draft bill on the extension of the housing 
contracts concluded between the state-owned housing companies 
and private tenants, the draft bill on the setting up of the 
public corporation for irrigation, and the draft bill on the 
value of real estate and the stock exchange. The session is 
currently still in progress. 
  The Senate's special standing committees are in session 
today. Our correspondent Victor Spirache has reported that 
tomorrow at 1400 the Senate Standing Bureau is to hold a meeting 
to examine whether it is necessary to summon an extraordinary 
session of that parliamentary chamber as well.

  [Text] The press bureau of the Democratic Union of 
Hungarians in Romania [UDMR] has sent us an information bulletin 
containing a communique that outlines the issues discussed 
during the meeting of the UDMR Executive Presidium that took 
place on 4 January in Cluj-Napoca. Among other things, the 
document says that they discussed ways in which the economic 
interests of the Hungarian ethnic minority could be protected 
and agreed to elaborate the rules according to which the UDMR's 
economic council is to function. To avoid ethnic discrimination 
within the privatization process of the state property, it was 
assessed that a first step would be seeing to it that experts of 
that ethnic minority are also represented among the dignitaries 
of the State Property Fund who are to be appointed by the 
government. 
  The UDMR Executive Presidium also discussed the agenda of 
the 
conference that is to be held with the chairmen of the UDMR 
county branches on 8 January in Miercurea Ciuc, as well as a 
report on the preparations made in view of the conference that 
will concentrate on the issue of self-government, scheduled to 
take place on 15 January in Odorheiul Secuiesc. 
  Learning about President Ion Iliescu's assessments of the 
1989 events in Romania and the ethnic conflict that took place 
in March 1990 in Tirgu Mures -- which were published in the 
[Iliescu's] memoirs -- the UDMR Executive Presidium considers 
them unacceptable, as they represent the falsification of 
history owing to political considerations. The need to 
establish the historic truth compels the UDMR Executive 
Presidium to urgently publish the critique based on sound 
arguments of that booklet [brosura], the communique released by 
the UDMR press bureau says, adding in conclusion that the 
presidium has sent a telegram saluting the conference on the 
self-government of the ethnic Hungarians living in Slovakia, 
scheduled for 8 January in Komarno. The presidium considers 
that event as an important step made in the spirit of current 
European processes, and not merely in view of the maintenance of 
the national identity of the Hungarian community living in 
Slovakia, but also that of all other Hungarian communities with 
a minority status.

<F P=106> [Text of "Declaration Issued by the Democratic Convention of </F>
Romania"; date not given] 
  [Text] The end of the year is always an opportunity to 
take stock. The Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] notes 
with concern that the inventory of the exercise of power by the 
current coalition of political forces does not acknowledge the 
alarm signals being more and more clearly emitted by Romanian 
society. 
  The economic crisis and the social crisis experienced by 
Romania thus turn into the nation's serious crisis of confidence 
in the political forces, which have assumed the responsibility 
to rule the country. The immobilism and uncertainty that those 
in power enjoy, the absence of a firm political desire for 
change, as well as voluntarism and arrogance do not offer 
tangible answers to the growing desperation of our citizens 
regarding the serious economic imbalance and the increasing and 
futile sacrifices, which an incompetent government has been 
perpetuating for more than a year now. 
  Instead of protecting the standard of living and the 
security 
of citizens, those in power protect corruption and stagnation. 
Instead of making efforts to bring about change and structural 
reform that might put an end to our crisis, and instead of 
promoting truth, the executive power perpetuates confusion and 
stagnation that permit the preservation of the privileges of a 
petty and greedy political clientele. No generous project, no 
disinterested thoughts, and no respect for the interests of the 
citizen and for the sovereign interests of the nation inspires 
the policy of the current holders of the essential levers of our 
country's political activity. 
  The CDR has done everything in its power to change this 
tense 
situation. It has always promoted a policy of supporting a firm 
policy of reform and has effectively supported all correct legal 
initiatives -- unfortunately too few so far. It has 
consistently and responsibly assumed the basic political task 
characteristic of any opposition, namely to criticize the errors 
made by the executive power. Through constitutional means at 
its disposal, it has drawn attention to the growing mistrust of 
citizens in the policy promoted by the coalition forces, which 
ensured the PDSR's [Social Democracy Party of Romania] majority 
in Parliament, and in the way in which the PDSR government has 
fulfilled its mandate. On several occasions, it proposed a 
program of stopping the crisis and it has shown its readiness 
for any dialogue that would have permitted the fulfillment of 
this program and the halting of the dramatic deterioration of 
the citizens' standard of living. 
  The systematic rejection of these arguments, the demagogic 
and arrogant answer by the majority coalition, which did not 
heed these signals and continued verbal maneuvers and back-stage 
moves instead of firmly implementing at least its own reform 
program, have taken our country to a serious crisis of political 
confidence. 
  It is clear for anyone that one cannot govern correctly with 
a majority of 13 votes in parliament and a proportion of 
confidence, without any precedent in the past four years. The 
PDSR is trying to persuade us that these are inevitable effects 
of any reform policy; it is obvious, however, for anyone that, 
on the contrary, these are the effects of lack of will to 
promote the reform process. Our citizens realize very well that 
stagnation and the absence of a consistent strategy for change 
generate a chaotic and uncontrollable development of the 
inflation and an unprecedented impoverishing of the majority of 
the population, and they realize that the government imposes 
useless sacrifices on the country; the electorate realizes very 
well that the government's lack of prospects takes all of us 
down a blind lane from which it will be more and more difficult 
to emerge. 
  Within this context, the CDR calls on the entire nation not 
to lose hope. There are still a lot of competent people and 
generous ideas to put an end to this crisis. These latent 
forces have to become the essential vector of our political 
activity. Through our joint will, let us make the PDSR renounce 
the bankrupt policy that it continues to promote, and to adopt a 
new policy able to stir and involve all those who are waiting 
for a new wave in our country. We are calling on all 
responsible political formations, all trade unions and civic 
associations, and the entire Romanian society to rally around 
the CDR in order to impose a new political pact on those in 
power; a pact that will rally all forces favoring change and 
that will keep away reactionary, extremist, and antireform 
forces from the executive power; a pact that will ensure the 
responsible promotion of a clear-cut, generous, and intelligent 
strategy for coming out of this crisis; and a pact that will put 
an end to misery, poverty, corruption, and lies. Let us turn 
1994 into the first year of a prosperous, powerful, and 
dignified Romania! 
  [Signed] Emil Constantinescu, CDR president

<F P=106> [Interview with Alexandru Radocea, president of the National </F>
Statistics Commission, by Ion Pavelescu; place and date not 
given: "Romania's Economy Has Already Embarked on the Road of 
Being Relaunched"] 
  [Text] Not long ago, the German daily FRANKFURTER 
ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG known for its -- mildly put -- hardly 
favorable position toward Romania and the commentaries by Viktor 
Meier, who never missed an opportunity to attack us, amazed its 
readers with the statement that, among the eastern countries, 
our state has genuine possibilities to recover economically and 
that this is already noticeable. Surprised, not to use a 
stronger word, by this assessment, we approached Mr. Alexandru 
Radocea, president of the National Statistics Commission, asking 
him to comment on the article published by the aforementioned 
daily and to review, in general terms, the year that has almost 
come to an end. 
  I accept your invitation with pleasure, he said, especially 
since, now that the Cassandras have multiplied, DIMINEATA is 
among the few newspapers trying to inform its readers correctly 
by abiding by the truth, which is not all that black as some 
people, who are interested in an end-of-the-world atmosphere, 
describe it. 
  [Pavelescu] Mr. Radocea, what is the situation of our 
economy? Is the economy the beginning and the end of everything? 
  [Radocea] It would be premature to talk about abundance in 
our country. Certainly, however, the main commitment assumed by 
the Vacaroiu government when it was invested -- namely to halt 
the decline of the production -- has been fulfilled. Here are 
figures to prove this. Throughout the 11 months that have 
elapsed in 1993, industrial production increased 0.4 percent, in 
comparable prices, compared with the same period last year. In 
agriculture, despite the unfavorable conditions that affected 
four counties in the southern part of our country -- one of our 
bread baskets -- where not a drop of rain fell for months on 
end, this recovery process can be clearly noted because the 
volume of grain production is 11 percent higher than in 1992, 
and the animal breeding sector also shows signs of recovery. 
  [Pavelescu] Mr. Radocea, which industrial branches have made 
the balance tip toward a positive direction? 
  [Radocea] These are the weighty and prevalently modern 
branches. They include such branches as chemistry, certain 
machine- building and mining branches, and the furniture 
industry. As a conclusion that exceeds the competence of the 
statistician but which should not be omitted, we have to mention 
that the new economic mechanism has begun to function and that 
branches and units recording positive results do so because of 
the judicious blend between mature personnel and the dynamism of 
young specialists. 
  [Pavelescu] There still are, however, areas in which 
stagnation persists and in which things do not develop with the 
necessary vigor.... 
  [Radocea] That is correct. Metallurgy, the garment 
industry, and the food industry, as well as the tobacco 
processing industry, are not moving at all. There would be 
explanations, but this is not the right time to dwell on them. 
  [Pavelescu] For this reason, for the time being, we have a 
trade balance deficit in the sense that we import more than we 
export. 
  [Radocea] This is a fact that we cannot ignore. But even in 
this respect, one can note signs of recovery, albeit modest ones. 
  [Pavelescu] What is the employment situation of our labor 
force? 
  [Radocea] Unemployment continues to grow. The current 
unemployment rate is approximately 9.9 percent of the active 
labor force. A comparison with the countries surrounding us or 
with more distant ones could render false projections. We have 
a smaller number of unemployed than Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, 
and even France. But can anyone be at peace when more than a 
million people have no jobs? 
  [Pavelescu] In this context, would it seem ill-timed to ask 
you about the standard of living? 
  [Radocea] Not in the least. The incomes of the population 
have considerably increased. And conditions exist that in 
December they may be even higher. 
  [Pavelescu] A key question: How will 1994 start off? 
  [Radocea] I am convinced that conditions are in place for 
next year to mark the much-awaited relaunching of the economy. 
The economic mechanism based on market laws has been broken in 
and has been perfected. Numerous branches, including 
metallurgy, have come up with promising anticrisis programs. 
The contracts that have been concluded, including exports, seem 
to be encouraging. Agriculture will unmistakably progress. In 
the area of utilizing the labor force, the indicators will 
improve along with the relaunching of the construction activity 
in the spring. I believe that we have embarked on the right 
road. 
  And since from the very beginning I talked to you about my 
friendly feelings toward the paper for which you work, permit me 
to conclude in the same vein by using this opportunity to convey 
wishes for good health and work energy to the editorial team, 
and best wishes for your readers in 1994, together with the 
traditional Romanian wish of "Many Happy Returns!"

  [Excerpt] Zagreb, Jan 6 (AFP) -- General Jean Cot, 
commander of the UN Protection Force in former Yugoslavia, 
criticised Thursday the lack of "useful dialogue" between United 
Nations policy-makers and armed forces on the ground. 
  Deploring the insufficiency of UNPROFOR resources, the 
general called for the creation of a "rapid reaction force" as 
the solution to the crisis in former Yugoslavia and spoke out 
against what earlier this month he described as the 
"humiliations" inflicted on UN personnel in Bosnia-Hercegovina. 
  His comments echoed criticisms by Geneva peace mediator 
Thorvald Stoltenberg in Budapest of the "abyss between (UN) 
political ambitions and reality" in former Yugoslavia, in which 
the UN passed resolutions promising to send peacekeepers to 
former Yugoslavia but failed to provide the necessary funding. 
  "If they (UN officials in New York) consulted responsible 
military leaders more systematically, maybe we could set up a 
useful dialogue," Cot told Croatian media. Even this would not 
be enough because of the "inertia of the system," he said. 
  The solution, in the French general's view, was the creation 
of a "rapid reaction force that we could send into the field 
within a few hours or a few days...in regions of potential 
crisis." 
  Cot again protested at what on January 1 he described as the 
"constant humiliation" of UN personnel in former Yugoslavia, 
notably Bosnia-Herzegovina. The UN forces were drawn from 
"armies which have a certain sense of dignity, so that you can't 
deal with them in the field in any old way," he said. 
  He stressed that the UNPROFOR mandate in Bosnia was purely 
humanitarian: "We have no mandate for interposing ourselves 
between the combatants. Our means are already insufficient for 
distributing humanitarian aid, and we must not disperse our 
efforts in other missions, except in the safe areas," he said. 
  Cot commended the outgoing commander of UNPROFOR in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Belgian General Francis Briquemont, who on 
Wednesday [5 January] said he was leaving his job earlier than 
expected because he was exhausted by the conflict. Briquement 
had "given so much, it was difficult to give more, and when you 
give so much you wear yourself out a little," Cot said. "I 
understand and respect his decision to take up the command in 
his own army that he left to come here. Let people not look for 
reasons.... which are totally false," he said, in reference to 
reports that Briquement had been recalled by Brussels following 
his outspoken criticisms of UN impotence in the Bosnian 
conflict. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Srbobran, Jan 6 (TANJUG) -- The Moslem authorities 
Thursday allowed the departure of 250 Serb civilians from Zenica 
in the central part of war-ravaged Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bosnian 
Serb military sources in Srbobran (former Donji Vakuf) reported. 
The Serb civilians reached the territory of the Bosnian serb 
republic (RS) sometime in the afternoon. The RS authorities in 
cooperation with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 
will take charge of them. 
  RS government representative Branko Djokic who took part in 
the talks with the Moslems arranging for the Serbs' departure 
from Zenica said after the talks that the Moslems had expressed 
readiness to allow some 1,300 Serbs leaving Vitez, Novi Travnik 
and other central Bosnian cities under Bosnian Croat control to 
pass over their territory. The possibility of a meeting of 
representatives of all three warring sides in connection with 
this was also mentioned. 
  A civil, ethnic and religious war has been raging in the 
former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina since April 1992 
between the local Moslems, Serbs (Orthodox) and Croats 
(Catholic) in response to the Moslem leadership's efforts to 
turn Bosnia into a Moslem-dominated unitary state.

  [Text] Zvornik, Jan 6 (TANJUG) -- More than 30 vehicles 
with 256 tonnes of humanitarian aid headed for the Moslem 
enclaves in war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina and parts of Sarajevo 
under Moslem control freely passed Thursday through the 
territory of the Bosnian Serb Republic (RS). 
  According to Bosnian Serb military sources in Zvornik, on 
the 
border with Yugoslavia where the cargo controls are made, 13 
trucks of the UN High Commisioner for Refugees (UNHCR) have 
taken 72 tonnes of flour to Tuzla, north-east 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The International Committee of the Red 
Cross has taken 61 tonnes of flour and 35 tonnes of family food 
parcels to the same city. 
  Srebrenica, the Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia, has 
received 78 tonnes of flour and 10 tonnes of heating oil, and 10 
tonnes of heating oil have been sent to the medical center in 
Zvornik. 
  The international humanitarian organisation Duga from Skopje 
has sent three trailers with food and medicine to be distributed 
to both the Moslem and Serb-controlled parts of Sarajevo. 
  The delivery of humanitarian aid to the civilian population 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been hindered for months due to fierce 
Moslem-Croat fighting in the central and southern parts of the 
republic in which a war between local Serbs, Croats and Moslems 
has been raging since April 1992. During all this time the only 
safe way for the convoys is through the territory under Bosnian 
Serb control.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, Jan 6 (AFP) -- The threat of 
starvation looms over Bosnian Moslems in central Bosnia, UN 
officials warned Thursday as fierce fighting in Sarajevo killed 
at least seven people, wounded more than 50 others and shut the 
capital's airport. 
  UN military observers (UNMOs) had reported a critical food 
situation in some 50 villages in the Kakanj region, where the 
civilian population faced starvation, said UN Protection Force 
spokesman Major Idesbald van Biesebroeck. "UNMOs haven't seen 
anybody who died of starvation yet but it will not take long any 
more before that will happen," he said. "In the village of 
Ricica, some children are close to starvation," he added. 
  Croat and Serb forces were largely to blame for delays to 
aid 
supplies, he said. But he also hit out at the local councils' 
food distribution policies, notably in Kakanj, where priority 
was given to soldiers, families of soldiers killed in combat, 
wounded soldiers and local politicians, with the most deprived 
people helped last. 
  The UN High Commissioner for Refugees civil affairs 
spokesman, Larry Hollingworth, confirmed the report: "Without a 
shadow of doubt the situation is desperate." 
  In December the UNHCR was able to deliver only 17.9 percent 
of the region's food requirements, he said. Hollingworth said 
he had no direct proof aid was being confiscated by troops from 
all three armies, but added: "(With) no other aid coming (in) 
and soldiers looking healthy, what can one conclude?" 
  In Sarajevo, an artillery battle and ground fighting erupted 
as the Moslem-dominated Bosnian army and Serb units resumed 
their struggle for the Serb-held Grbavica district. Government 
forces recently won territory in Grbavica from the Serbs holding 
the area located along the Miljacka river, a foreign military 
expert said. 
  Two civilians were decapitated by shell fragments in 
separate 
incidents and two other people, including a Bosnian soldier, 
were killed in the fighting, said doctors at the city's two 
functioning hospitals. Some 42 people were reported wounded, 
including a two-month old baby. [passage omitted] 
  Sarajevo airport reopened briefly early Thursday but was 
closed again almost immediately due to the fighting and no 
flights were able to land. Aid flights were suspended late 
Wednesday after a rocket hit the runway. [passage omitted] 
  Foreign ministers from the Organisation of the Islamic 
Conference are to meet Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic in 
Geneva on January 17, the eve of the resumption of peace talks 
on Bosnia, blocked over Moslem demands for more land.

<F P=106> [Marko Caric article: "Is Tesanj Following in Abdic's </F>
Footsteps?"] 
  [Text] What is happening within the political and military 
Muslim structures in the Tesanj area? According to reliable 
information, it seems that the war option chosen by Alija 
Izetbegovic has no support among the Muslim population in that 
part of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We have learned from reliable 
sources that the Center of Security Services has done an 
analysis of the political and military situation in the area, 
concluding that the process of making Tesanj independent 
following the model of west Bosnia and Velika Kladusa is under 
way. The analysis, made by Semsudin Mehmedovic, coordinator of 
the Center of Security Services, has warned the authorities in 
Sarajevo that the appearance of "a new Fikret Abdic" was 
possible in the Tesanj area. Semsudin Mehmedovic and his 
Security Service, naturally, blame the Croats for this process. 
However, things are much simpler. 
  Namely, the War Presidency of the Municipal Assembly of 
Tesanj refused to carry out the order of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Presidency concerning the unconditional placing of all HVO 
[Croatian Defense Council] units active in the areas controlled 
by Muslim political and military forces under the command of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. The War Presidency of the Tesanj 
commune issued the following statement: 
  "On the territory of Usora and Tesanj the Croats and Muslims 
have fought against the same enemy since the beginning of the 
war. The result of this fighting is fully defended territory. 
So far there have been no conflicts between our two peoples. 
The Presidency believes that these relations should remain the 
same in the future, since that is the only guarantee and token 
for the survival of both peoples in this area.... The civilian 
and military bodies, as well as members of both peoples consider 
the implementation of the decision of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Presidency pointless. Any attempt to implement this decision by 
force would result in conflict with incalculable consequences 
for the population, and probably in the loss of the free 
territory, which has been defended at the cost of a great number 
of lives. With all due respect for the importance and possible 
consequences of the decision of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Presidency, the War Presidency of the Tesanj commune has decided 
not to implement the decision on this territory..." 
  Therefore, the matter simply concerns the fact that the 
political leadership of the Tesanj commune believes that the HVO 
and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army troops should continue to work 
together, but that an integration of the HVO in the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army would be politically and militarily 
inopportune. 
  In the analysis made by the Center of Security Services and 
signed by Semsudin Mehmedovic, this decision of the War 
Presidency is being interpreted as a subversive activity -- 
carried out primarily by the Croats, but also by some military 
and political structures of the so-called Serb republic. 
Mehmedovic does not substantiate such statements in the 
analysis, but instead merely provides a catalogue of accusations. 
  Ekrem Ajanovic, regional representative in the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly, also joined the action of 
disrupting the unity of the Muslims and Croats in the Tesanj 
area and the surrounding territory. On the basis of the alleged 
approval of Alija Izetbegovic, he formed a committee for 
negotiations between the Muslims, Croats, and Serbs, but this 
committee submitted to the Center of Security Services a list of 
Croats to be arrested, and if this was not possible, killed. 
They were HVO representatives who, from October to December, 
participated in political negotiations between Muslims, Croats, 
and Serbs in this area. The result of all this is the absurd 
situation in which the Tesanj area is being defended by joint 
forces of the HVO and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, while they 
are continuously being attacked by Bosnia-Herzegovina Army units 
that want to implement Alija Izetbegovic's fundamentalist 
policies. All efforts to create disunity between the Muslims 
and Croats living in the Tesanj area have, fortunately, been 
unsuccessful. Evidently there is an increasing number of 
Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina who realize how damaging Alija 
Izetbegovic's policies are, and who want to do everything to end 
the war as soon as possible, along with the Croats, and continue 
to live in peace and understanding.

  [Text] Sarajevo, Jan 6 (TANJUG) -- One woman was killed and 
six civilians were injured in fierce Muslim attacks on the Serb 
part of New Sarajevo, Serb military sources reported Thursday. 
The Muslim attacks started [word indistinct] 22:00 hours (local 
time) Wednesday but stopped after about two hours when the Serb 
side returned fire. They were resumed early in the morning 
Thursday. 
  The Serb side lodged a complaint with the UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] Command asking for the attacks to be halted 
fault of which it would answer back with all means of arms at 
its disposal. 
  Muslim artillery and infantry attacks were reported in north 
Bosnia in the Maglaj region and an attempt of a Muslim sabotage 
group to infiltrate into Serb territory was thwarted in the 
Doboj front. 
  Serb military sources report that in the region of Srbobran 
(formerly Donji Vakuf), central Bosnia, Muslims are attacking 
Serb positions and concentrating their forces which could mean 
that they are getting ready for more heavy fighting. In (?the 
night) of Wednesday/Thursday the Muslims also mounted attacks 
from the Gorazde enclave, eastern Bosnia, on Serb defence 
positions around Foca and Cajnice. 
  Along the Sava river (north Bosnia) the Croat forces renewed 
artillery attacks last night firing 30 grenades on Serb 
positions. The attack stopped when the Serb fighters returned 
fire. 
  In the Mostar valley, south-west Bosnia, fierce fighting 
continues between Croats and Muslims, erstwhile allies against 
the Serbs. Both sides use all means of weapons at their 
disposal in the combats in Mostar and its surroundings, 
including artillery and tanks, acording to Serb military sources.

Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 on 7 January carries in its 
regular 14-minute newscast several reports on the fighting in 
the Republic. Reception is fair to poor. 
  The studio announcer introduces the block of fighting 
reports 
with a warning to the citizens of Sarajevo "to observe strictly 
all the measures in line with the general alarm, as the chetniks 
have been shelling the city heavily since early morning." 
  Reporting from Olovo, Velid Djindo says that "last night was 
marked by loud explosions of shells fired from the heavy 
artillery of the [Serbs and Croatian Defense Council -- HVO] 
occupying forces. Olovo was fiercely shelled just after 
midnight, but fortunately that attack as well as the bestial 
ones this morning passed without human casualties." 
  The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 3d Corps reports that "following 
the report by Croatia Radio Television about the fighters of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army having massacred 74 civilians in 
Krizancevo Selo, the members of the UN Protection Forces 
[UNPROFOR] British Battalion yesterday visited this area. In 
front of the BBC and Reuter cameras, everyone could see that the 
graves contained bodies, not massacred, of the HVO fighters 
killed in the latest Ustasha offensive on the Vitez front." 
  In his report from Brcko, Hamiz Deronjic says that "it was a 
very dramatic night. The Serb aggressor shelled the defense 
positions heavily, also activated his sabotage groups, and used 
his aircraft intensively for the transportation of men and 
equipment. At about 2100 last night, an enemy 
reconnaissance-sabotage group tried to break through our lines 
in Lipovac. The defenders responded quickly, however, and 
forced the enemy saboteurs to pull back. This was followed by 
barrages of 82-mm and 120-mm mortars fired from enemy 
positions." He says that "last night was one of the busiest 
ones along the air corridor. In groups of two and three the 
enemy transport helicopters kept flying back and forth from 
(Razljevo) to Pelagicevo between 1800 and 2200. At about 2200 
one enemy aircraft turned from the usual 
Bijeljina-Brcko-Pelagicevo direction and flew from Lopari to 
Srebrenik. According to further information, the aggressor's 
helicopter then headed toward Maglaj." 
  Describing the situation in Maglaj, Hajrudin Sermic says 
that 
"yesterday evening was extremely hard for the citizens of the 
town. Maglaj was exposed to pounding by the heaviest artillery 
and tanks, while the drunk chetniks helped along by [HVO 
commander] Lozancic's fighters fired dum-dum and incendiary 
ammunition from antiaircraft machine guns and guns." He says 
that "last night the chetniks again made fools of the Security 
Council and NATO. One of the aggressor's helicopters infiltrated 
the group of transport planes airdropping aid to the population 
and carried out its combat mission unhindered." 
  Izudin Durakovic reports from the Gracanica front that "all 
night the chetnik forces fired at the defense lines and 
residential areas in the zone of responsibility of the Gracanica 
Operative Group. On the Doboj front, the chetniks from Lipac 
and Radici used 82-mm and 120-mm mortars against (Sanicvisi) and 
Klopotnica, while from (Prenja) they fired with a 155-mm 
howitzer at Velika Brijesnica." He says that "since 0400 this 
morning the chetniks have been pounding the defense lines on the 
Gracanica front." During the night, he adds, "the aggressor 
carried out an intensive regrouping of his forces. Three 
truckloads of men arrived in (Palezica) from Doboj and another 
four in Stipovac. Their helicopters were also flying along the 
Bosansko Petrovo Selo-(Kagmus)-(Boljenic) route, and along the 
(Hrtova)-Rosulje-Vijenac route."

  [Text] Minister of Foreign Affairs Josef Zieleniec spoke at 
a news conference in Prague today on the coming visit to Prague 
of U.S. President Bill Clinton. He said that its program could 
be seriously changed by the death in the family of the U.S. 
President. Despite this, it is envisaged that the first day of 
the talks will have a bilateral Czech-U.S. character, while the 
second day of the visit will be devoted to consultations with 
representatives of other Visegrad countries. 
  As to the much discussed question of our relation toward 
NATO, Josef Zieleniec said: 
  [Begin Zieleniec recording] The fact is that we are 
seriously 
discussing with our Western partners, and thus also with the 
United States, our future membership, and we are expecting a 
statement saying that NATO is an open alliance. [end recording]

  [Text] The viewpoint on the coming visit of U.S. President 
Bill Clinton to Prague was published by the Left Bloc today. 
Jaroslav Ortman, deputy chairman of the party, said the 
following: 
  [Begin Ortman recording] The changed situation in Europe, we 
are convinced, should lead toward seeking new paths to solving 
questions of security and not toward using [word indistinct] 
patterns. It is obvious that the policy of the U.S. Government 
and the United States, presented by the "Partnership for Peace" 
plan, is in the incipient stage. 
  The path of the Left Bloc does not lead via the expansion of 
NATO. We have registered the words of Prime Minister Klaus 
saying that membership of the Czech Republic in NATO is not 
topical. No one wants us there anyway at the moment. 
  We see a solution in the system of collective security and 
not in the existence of a military pact of a part of Europe, 
whether big or small. We are convinced that, particularly in the 
sphere of seeking paths of collective security, Czech foreign 
policy should be much more active. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy </F>
by Martin Frydl; place and date not given: "Stability During 
Economic Growth Requires a New Blend of Economic Policy"] 
  [Text] [Frydl] Mr. Minister, in your opinion, in what did 
the Trade and Industry Ministry succeed most last year and, on 
the contrary, in what did it succeed least? 
  [Dlouhy] If we talk about individual issues, I would say 
that, for instance, the successes included foreign visits. I 
inherited these from the Federal Foreign Trade Ministry, without 
a clearly defined concept, and I think we succeeded in getting 
them under way and in implementing a program supporting Czech 
exporters. On the other hand, I could talk about all sorts of 
problems: Temelin and the economic agreements, the Ingolstadt 
oil pipeline and state guarantees for the Bavarian Government, 
and the unfortunate case of Libkovice. However, no matter how 
many individual issues economic life is made up of, it is not 
evaluated according to them. The fundamental question is whether 
the Czech Republic's economic development in 1993 was correct 
and whether the government contributed to this by its economic 
policy. I think the answers to both questions are positive. 
Economic policy was oriented, first and foremost, toward 
maintaining macroeconomic stability and releasing certain growth 
incentives. If we compare the third quarter of 1993 and the 
third quarter of 1992, the figures do not indicate much growth. 
If we look at the absolute figures, however, it is possible to 
anticipate economic growth as early as the first quarter of this 
year. 
  [Frydl] The Czech Republic is doing relatively well in the 
macro sphere but is somewhat behind in the micro sphere. It is 
enough, for example, to look at insolvency or at the, so far, 
imperfect legislation. What can be done? We will not get by for 
long with a good macro situation alone. 
  [Dlouhy] This is true. If we do not succeed in getting 
growth 
under way, we will not maintain the stability of the 
macroeconomic parameters for long. If Czech enterprises do not 
improve their efficiency and productivity, our economy's 
development will begin to decline and get into difficulty. The 
macro parameters will not last if they are not generated from 
the micro level. From the Industry Ministry's point of view, I 
see a major problem in the implementation of ownership rights. 
We often hear criticism from the National Property Fund that 
there are banks here that, through the privatization funds, own 
a large part of the Czech economy, and the question is just how 
capable of implementing their rights are these owners, of 
restructuring, of closing inefficient production lines, and of 
obtaining new quality management. I consider this to be one of 
the most important microeconomic issues. 
  [Frydl] Do you think the current relatively good 
macroeconomic situation is proceeding from the good 
microeconomic situation or, rather, from the initial impetus 
caused by the change in our economy's orientation and the 
opening up of new opportunities? 
  [Dlouhy] The good macroeconomic situation is, first and 
foremost, a result of the fact that economic policy since 1990 
has been conceived as a "package" of mutually linked steps: a 
balanced budget, relatively strong financial restrictions from 
the beginning, convertibility, and others. Compare the countries 
of the former CEMA, where the reform steps are not linked, and 
you will see far worse problems than in our country. The Czech 
Republic has also succeeded in reorienting its exports from the 
former CEMA to West European and other markets, and a private 
sector has evolved that has absorbed a considerable segment of 
unemployment. All of this has contributed to macro stability. It 
will not continue to be maintained by this alone, however. The 
time has come to show why we conducted privatization, and the 
private owners have to guarantee stability in the enterprises. 
Apart from this, until now we had macro stability during 
economic decline or stagnation. Now we want stability during 
economic growth. This requires a quite different blend of 
economic policy. 
  [Frydl] The government has specific prerequisites for future 
economic growth from which it proceeds in formulating its 
policy. It is banking on an average GDP increase of some 3.5 
percent per annum up to the year 2000. With such growth, 
however, we will catch up with advanced states very, very 
slowly. In your opinion, would it not be bette, if not this year 
then at least in the future, to restore the Czech economy a 
little--for example, through the state budget? Are the several 
billions for so-called development projects in this year's 
budget enough to stimulate the economy? 
  [Dlouhy] The economy cannot be stimulated in one go. The 
aforementioned prodevelopment elements will certainly have some 
effect. This is simply the first step, and, in 1995, the 
situation could be far different in this regard. However, we are 
still at the transformation stage, and our economy is just 
establishing within itself all of the traits of the market. The 
question is whether increasing budget expenditure or, as the 
case may be, the budget deficit would lead to economic growth or 
to higher inflation. In reality, these two factors are combined. 
However, one of them always prevails over the other. 
  [Frydl] Some people are comparing us with the "Asian tigers" 
whose economic growth has reached, and in some cases is 
reaching, the order of 10 percent. 
  [Dlouhy] Their conditions are completely different from 
ours. 
Such an ideal health and social security system, time off, and 
so on does not exist in many Asian countries. In other words, 
the people there are far less demanding. Our country is 
unwilling and indeed cannot tighten its belt so much in order to 
attain such growth. Instead, we should follow the paths of 
Portugal and Greece, but, of course, with the advantage of a far 
better quality work force. Despite this, we are not burdened 
with the Western welfare state syndrome; we have great 
commercial potential. However, it is necessary to state that our 
economic path toward Europe will be a path on a scale of several 
decades. The real rapprochement of living standards will take a 
long time. 
  [Frydl] You compare us with the countries of southern 
Europe. 
They have received considerable assistance by joining the EC, 
however, and it is hard to say where their economies would be 
today without this membership. Moreover, at the moment, we 
cannot rely too much on the whim of the European Union [EU]. 
What do you think of the opinion that, in view of our membership 
being a distant prospect, we should not set such great store by 
it? 
  [Dlouhy] I would not say that we will be relying on the EU's 
whim. Many other countries are waiting to join, and the 
Community has made it clear to us that we will not become a 
member in a year or two. It will be a long process. For example, 
Austria, Sweden, and Finland are ahead of us. Due to our 
advantages, however, we may be in a better position than, for 
instance, Greece and Portugal, although we will not receive 
subsidies from the EU's budget. However, I am afraid that we 
will not get ahead at the pace of the Asian tigers. We are a 
European country with a European environment, traditions, and 
habits. I have already demonstrated on several occasions a 
certain restraint with regard to the EU. This is associated with 
the aforementioned foreign visits, in which I try to visit other 
countries and thus expand our economic contacts. On the other 
hand, I would not want the Czech Republic to choose, as an 
explicit policy, to orient itself other than toward the EU. 
European integration is a train from which we cannot jump. 
  [Frydl] The issue of the Czech economy's specific 
orientation 
in the world economy is associated with this. Some rapidly 
developing countries have found a "market gap" on which to base 
their prosperity. This could be a specific branch of industry, a 
general technological orientation, unequivocal support for 
exports, and so on. It seems that, at the moment, the Czech 
Republic does not have such a strategy. 
  [Dlouhy] Today it is very difficult to find any gap in the 
market and hold on to it for any length of time. A gap in the 
market arises as a consequence of insufficient information about 
supply and demand. In essence, this phenomenon no longer exists. 
Trade is globalizing. Today, when a country begins to 
manufacture socks from its own raw materials, it is highly 
probable that an enterprise in another country (for example, an 
Asian one) will soon begin to import these raw materials and 
also start to manufacture socks and export them to the original 
country at a profit. Moreover, it is mainly certain Asian states 
that have chosen the path of "concentrating their efforts" 
mentioned by you. Thus, we come back to European conditions. 
  [Frydl] So far, the trend in Czech exports is satisfactory. 
However, opinions are being expressed that this is a temporary 
boom arising from the new opportunities for gaining access to 
Western markets. Apparently, the potential competition will not 
wait long, and the state will have to help our exporters more 
than at the moment. 
  [Dlouhy] The main conceptual support for our exports 
was--and, in a number of cases, still is--the koruna's exchange 
rate, undervalued against purchasing power parity. When we set 
its rate in 1990, we came in for a great deal of criticism. 
However, we said clearly that this is, first and foremost, a 
proxport measure. The aforementioned foreign visits are another 
deliberate policy in support of our exports. 
  [Frydl] In your opinion, is our proexport policy sufficient 
for the present and the future? 
  [Dlouhy] No. We are again turning to the issue of the growth 
we want to achieve. The capacity of the small Czech economy is 
greater than its domestic market. Therefore, growth cannot 
proceed other than by exports. The advantage of an undervalued 
exchange rate will last for some time yet, but it will gradually 
be reduced. Apart from this, in a number of cases, our exporters 
are unable to compete because they do not have at their disposal 
the financial, insurance, and other mechanisms needed to support 
exports, the kind of mechanisms their competitors have. 
  [Frydl] So, the money in the Export Guarantee and Insurance 
Company [EGAP] is not enough? 
  [Dlouhy] It is very little. EGAP should gradually transfer 
to 
self-financing. It is impossible for the state to keep 
subsidizing it from the budget because this would not be fair to 
the other taxpayers. Despite this, before its commencement, it 
requires a certain amount of funds, but, at the moment, this is 
not enough. 
  [Frydl] The issue of bankruptcies and your opinion that the 
state should initiate them has recently attracted a great deal 
of attention. The prime minister has come out against this, and 
your initiative has not aroused much response in other quarters. 
What will happen now? 
  [Dlouhy] It is true that my stance was rather isolated 
within 
the debate on bankruptcies. Nevertheless, I really think that 
there are few bankruptcies, that they proceed slowly, and that 
this is not good for stimulating economic growth. It is easy to 
say that this is a mistake and that it is necessary to do 
something immediately. The law on bankruptcy and settlement has 
to be examined to see if there are hitches in it that prevent 
bankruptcies. We can draw a matrix for the banks and put their 
privatization funds in the rows and, perhaps, all of this 
economy's more important enterprises in the columns. By 
declaring an enterprise to be bankrupt, a bank declares its own 
property bankrupt. This is a fact that certainly does not 
contribute to the commencement of bankruptcies. 
  [Frydl] Finally, how did you spend Christmas and the New 
Year? 
  [Dlouhy] I was on vacation. I had promised myself that, 
sometime in the evening of 23 December, I would say: Good, now I 
am satisfied and will put my feet up on the table. This did not 
work out exactly because I had the flu. However, I spent New 
Year's Eve with my family.

  [Text] Bratislava--"I appreciate President Michal Kovac's 
realistic view of the contemporary Slovak political scene and 
the Slovak Republic's present problems." This is how Jan 
Carnogursky, chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement 
[KDH], reacted to the Slovak president's New Year address, which 
was broadcast on radio and television on Saturday [1 January]. 
Slovakia does indeed need a broad coalition, the KDH chairman 
continued, and our movement is ready to form such a coalition 
along with those parties or parts of parties whose programs are 
compatible with our program in the sense that at least a 
compromise is possible. 
  Other politicians, too, voiced their opinions on the 
contents 
of the Slovak president's New Year address. 
  "The idea of a broad coalition is not new. The Party of the 
Democratic Left [SDL] endorsed it before and after the 
elections. We have never claimed that we have five experts for 
every ministerial post [allusion to Prime Minister Meciar's 
statement] and that we could accomplish everything on our own," 
SDL Chairman Peter Weiss said. "The SDL was ready to cooperate, 
but the idea of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] 
was such that it would share not power but only responsibility 
for the execution of power. Saying `join us' represents no 
platform for cooperation. A broad coalition is not possible with 
the HZDS as a whole, but only with that part of the HZDS that is 
willing and able to draw moral and political conclusions from 
the mistakes committed by the ruling movement," the SDL chairman 
added. 
  Milan Secansky (HZDS): "What I appreciated in the 
president's 
New Year address were his words about Slovakia's prosperity, 
which, as he stressed, can be achieved only through unity. I 
consider the unification of the politically fragmented forces in 
Slovakia the only way to achieve prosperity." 
  Vojtech Bugar (Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement): 
"The president realistically assessed the possibilities for the 
emergence of a broad coalition, which should stabilize the 
political situation in Slovakia. Current problems must not be 
brought to a head but tackled. I cannot help but agree with this 
view. And I can even agree with the view that, without the HZDS, 
it is impossible to form a broad coalition. However, I am 
convinced that it is possible to form such a coalition without 
Mr. Meciar."

  [Excerpt] A Slovak Government delegation led by Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Jozef Moravcik left Israel for Cyprus by air 
this morning. Here is our special correspondent Agata Stanekova 
reporting from Nicosia: 
  [Stanekova] Let us begin with the delegation's visit to 
Israel, which ended today. Minister of Foreign Affairs Jozef 
Moravcik, speaking to journalists aboard the plane today, said 
that pursuing a well-balanced policy in the entire region was an 
important issue for Slovakia. The visit was meant to send a 
clear signal, saying that the Slovak Republic wants to continue 
the process of deepening relations with Israel in every sphere, 
and we understood the visit as the first stage in realizing this 
fundamental aim, Jozef Moravcik said. 
  During the flight to Cyprus, I also asked Slovak Minister of 
Economy Jan Ducky to assess the visit. 
  [Begin Ducky recording] I am convinced, and this view was 
shared by our Israeli partners, that this was a historic visit 
because at long last we were able to normalize relations between 
Israel and Slovakia. This fact is of great importance for 
entrepreneurs and bankers in both countries because at last we 
can start working on the basis of direct contacts without 
middlemen and third parties. This should be reflected in both 
the extent of our cooperation and its effectiveness. 
  I think the visit was very useful. Participating were not 
only members of the government delegation but also 15 
entrepreneurs from almost all spheres of industry and a strong 
delegation representing the banking circles, led by National 
Bank of Slovakia Governor Masar. [end recording] [passage

  [Text] Belgrade, 6 Jan (TANJUG) -- In connection with a 
statement issued by the Albanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
which was broadcast by several foreign news agencies from Tirana 
regarding frequent incidents that have taken place along the 
Yugoslav-Albanian border, the information service of the General 
Staff of the Yugoslav Army has issued the following explanation: 
  "Border units of the Yugoslav Army have been strictly 
observing the rules of border service, and all incidents in 
which people who were illegally crossing the border were either 
caught or killed have taken place on the territory of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
  "This has always been established by interstate commissions 
following investigations. 
  "Members of the Yugoslav Army have been facing an increasing 
number of attempts by Albanian citizens to cross the border 
illegally. Such people are armed, and on several occasions 
armed incidents occurred, resulting sometimes in the wounding or 
death of Yugoslav border guards. 
  "The latest incident, in which Albanian citizen Mustafa 
Ramadan was killed, took place on 3 January this year in the 
region of the border watchtower at Krstac on the territory of 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The mentioned person lost 
his life after he tried to escape, despite warnings given by the 
border guards of the Yugoslav Army," the explanation by the 
information service of the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army 
says in conclusion.

  [Text] Belgrade -- The president of the Republic wanted a 
parliament to be proud of, that is, a parliament that would be a 
voting machine for endorsing the national policy. Since he did 
not get it, he intends to give us a parliament made up of the 
military, the police, the judiciary, and the prosecution, and 
this "parliament" is already in session. 
  Addressing journalists at a news conference yesterday, Vuk 
Draskovic, president of the Serbian Renewal Movement, thus 
expressed doubt that the new Serbian parliament will be set up 
at all. 
  "The army is practicing beating up those who do not have 
anything to eat in front of the television, while the chief of 
the General Staff, threatening that he will not allow the 
violation of the Constitution, holds the view that all political 
parties except the Socialist Party of Serbia are a political 
evil, not realizing that the causes of this evil are sitting 
opposite him at the meeting of the Supreme Military Council. The 
District Public Prosecutor's Office is filing charges, while the 
police are arresting miners, railroad workers... and tomorrow 
students, workers, and peasants... thinking that they will fill 
the empty bakeries with bread by filling prisons with the 
hungry. We cannot go to Szeged [in Hungary], Sofia, or Skopje 
without paying a tax in German marks, and if Serbia continues in 
this way, I am afraid we will end up in Bucharest," Draskovic 
said. 
  The leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement mainly handled 
the 
many questions from journalists "with gloves." He mentioned a 
possibility of federal elections being held in April or May (and 
perhaps even new republican elections). He rejected the 
possibility of the Serbian Renewal Movement supporting the 
minority government of the Socialists. He indicated that 
electricity shortages before New Year happened because energy 
was being exported.... 
  However, the leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement assessed 
much more positively the current role of Vojislav Seselj ("we 
have not forgotten what he did, but he has now taken a correct 
stand toward the Socialist Party of Serbia"), confirming that he 
has been in telephone contact with the leader of the Radicals. 
The leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement also promised that 
the dispute between the Radicals and DEPOS [Democratic Movement 
of Serbia] concerning the setting up of a board of enquiry in 
the Chamber of Citizens will soon be resolved, "because mistakes 
were made by both sides."

  [Text] Belgrade, 6 Jan (TANJUG) -- Vojislav Seselj, 
chairman of the Serbian Radical Party [SRS], today condemned the 
behavior of the Belgrade regime toward elections in the republic 
of Serb Krajina, labeling it as "backroom dealing." 
  At a news conference, Seselj said that "backroom dealing by 
the Belgrade regime police in Krajina unveils the mechanism that 
the regime is also secretly using in Serbia." According to him, 
authorities in Serbia believe that by TV manipulations in the 
next 12 days, ahead of the fresh round of elections in Krajina, 
they can change the will of the Krajina people. "The Serbian 
Radical Party will do everything to prevent it," Seselj stressed. 
  He also announced that the Radicals will "do everything" to 
prevent the continuation of the government campaign against 
private business owners, members of the Serbian Radical Party, 
which has taken on the form of thwarting their business 
activities in order to ruin them financially. 
  Seselj also condemned, as he put it, the state terror 
against 
organizers of the latest strikes, which, according to him, are 
an expression of workers' discontent. "The regime must do 
something to avoid strikes, but not to achieve it by arresting 
organizers, but by improving the living standard of all those 
employed," he added. 
  Seselj read out a list of deputies to the Serbian Assembly 
appointed by the Main Committee of the Serbian Radical Party. 
Out of 39 SRS deputies to the republican parliament, these are 
the SRS MP's from the electoral district of Belgrade: Dragan 
Todorovic, Aleksandar Vucic, Stevan Vukajlovic, Dusica Nikolic, 
Stevo Dragisic, Miroslav Dereta, and Miroslav Bogdanovic. 
  MP's from the electoral district of Zrenjanin are: Radomir 
Popovic, Lazar Marjanski, Bozidar Vujic, and Ziva Ladicorbic. 
  MP's from the electoral district of Kragujevac are: Tomislav 
Nikolic, Miroslav Dramlic, Marko Popovic, Dragutin Stambolic, 
and Aco Gajic. 
  Deputies from the electoral district of Leskovac are: Jovica 
Stojmenovic, Stanislav Momcilovic, and Ljubomir Kragovic. 
  Deputies from the electoral district of Nis are: Dragoljub 
Stamenkovic, Branislav Vakic, Vojin Veljkovic, and Milovan 
Radovanovic. 
  Deputies from the electoral district of Novi Sad are: Igor 
Mirovic, Nikola Vasic, Milorad Marcic, Elvira 
Fekete-Vlaovic-Kovacev, Stanko Studen, Rade Pavlovic, and Sava 
Zarkov. 
  MP's from the electoral district of Pristina are: Jorgovanka 
Tabakovic and Vojislav Dimitrijevic. 
  MP's from the electoral district of Smederevo are: 
Aleksandar 
Djuric, Milovan Konstantinovic, and Zivorad Jeremic. 
  Deputies from Uzice are: Aleksandar Stefanovic, Zoran 
Subotic, Miroslav Neskovic, and Zivorad Tiosavic.

  [Text] The railroad, Serbian Electricity Board, Kolubara 
coal mines, and Belgrade Public Transport Company strikes came 
and went. What they left behind is the enormous damage done to 
the state and the citizens. They left behind the bitter 
realization that the organizers of the strikes did not show the 
least bit of solidarity with the citizens. The strikes took 
place -- what a coincidence -- on the eve of the New Year 
holidays, at a time when new threats by world powers started 
coming in, at a time of terrible and criminal sanctions imposed 
by order of the same world powers. 
  It is not a coincidence that the strikes were organized in 
enterprises of vital significance to the state and nation. The 
railroad, electricity board, coal mines, and public 
transportation are all state and national property. Therefore, 
they are not somebody's inheritance to be played with, even less 
to be used to blackmail both the state and the citizens. The 
members of the leaderships of the independent trade unions 
should be aware of this. They bear the greatest share of 
responsibility for the initiation and consequences of the 
strikes. Their sponsors are fully aware of this. 
  Those who issued the orders have, for the time being, 
remained behind the scenes. However, it is known that, for 
example, the Soros Foundation is significantly aiding the 
activities of some of the independent trade unions. This is 
precisely the foundation whose founder put his signature on the 
petition calling for the bombing of Belgrade. The strikes are 
sponsored by those who wish to destroy the Serbian people. 
  At the same time, the West was gloating over these pre-New 
Year events. Radio's Voice of America was ominously forecasting 
chaos in Serbia. Certain West European newspapers and certain 
domestic, so-called independent media were not far behind. They 
did not meet with success. The state reacted, and what is most 
important, the citizens -- although overwhelmed by great 
dissatisfaction and anger -- knew what the real background to 
the strikes was. The organizers also sensed this. 
  The County Public Prosecutor's Office qualified the strike 
in 
the Kolubara coal mines as attempted sabotage. However, we have 
to say that some of the responsible authorities did not react 
adequately, although there could be no doubt that someone was 
trying to sabotage and paralyze public life in Serbia. For the 
sake of truth it needs to be stated that the Kolubara miners -- 
and miners in other mines -- and the railroad and electricity 
board employees are not in a favorable position. However, they 
are in no worse a situation than the great majority of citizens. 
On the contrary, they have the largest salaries, and what's 
more, they do not hide this fact. 
  This is precisely the reason -- and responsibility -- that 
those employed in public companies, particularly at a time of 
crippling effects of sanctions imposed by the world powers, 
should exhibit more, much more solidarity with the citizens, who 
rightly expect them and the state to regularly supply them with 
electricity and coal, and to secure regular and safe railroad 
and bus transportation. The times call for solidarity, not 
pig-headedness.

<F P=106> [Article by P. Dzambazovski: "The Two Currents Against the </F>
Center"] 
  [Text] The PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity] Congress 
should take place by 15 January this year and the Preparatory 
Committee is intensively engaged in it, claiming that there will 
be no postponement this time. Menduh Taci, the leader of the 
so-called "hard" current and president of the Tetovo branch, has 
also become a member of the Committee. By the way, the delegates 
and ministers consider Taci an illegitimate president of the 
so-called new party leadership constituted at the Gostivar 
meeting last month. 
  As a reminder, toward the end of last year the PDP's breakup 
came to a head. The "hard" current did not give up its request 
for a change in the leading structures, which resulted in the 
collective resignation of the central Presidency, "in the 
interest of consolidation." The group headed by Taci received 
support from official Albania, which resulted in a meeting 
organized in Gostivar, where the new leadership was nominated, 
which was then proclaimed as illegitimate by the group of 
delegates and ministers. However, it seems that a kind of a 
compromise has been reached by making Taci a member of the 
Preparatory committee. His nomination was made in his capacity 
as president of the Tetovo branch, although the Committee 
considers his office illegitimate. We discovered from 
well-informed sources that such a decision was reached in order 
to avoid a deepening of the conflict situation, and it was 
emphasized that the Tetovo assembly was not held, and if Taci 
had not been elected president of the branch, and a delegate as 
well as a member of the Central Assembly, the Tetovo assembly 
would not participate in the Congress. 
  The same sources told us that there is a growing sense 
within 
the PDP that the collective Central Presidency resignation was a 
political error and nonsense, because there was no perception of 
further activities. The division within the party was deepened, 
and there was interference by official and semiofficial 
political circles in neighboring Albania, thus causing total 
confusion within the membership. The most surprising thing that 
happened was the support that Albania gave to Menduh Taci, who 
stated in Tirana that the new leadership (elected in Gostivar) 
would represent a factor of stability in Macedonia, (as if the 
old one had not been such a factor), while his assessments in 
Macedonia were that the old leadership was too mild, announcing 
a radical change in the party national policy concerning the 
state institutions. It was also estimated that the division 
caused a loss of confidence among the membership regarding the 
different currents of the power struggle and that the so-called 
center of the party, which, according to these sources, stands 
firmly on an election course, is in practical terms without a 
partner. Allegedly, the "hard" current does not have a precise 
political platform and its campaign stems from a superficial 
criticism. The group of delegates and ministers have been 
deeply involved with the authorities and policy, and, allegedly, 
they do not reflect clearly the wishes of the membership. 
  Concerning the Congress Preparatory Committee, which has the 
role of temporary party leadership, it is now headed by delegate 
Abdurahman Aliti, the documents are being prepared by delegate 
Naser Ziberi, and the member of the resigned Presidency, Mahi 
Nesimi, is engaged in the preparation of the program, and is 
also going to be in charge of the press service. The 
well-informed sources claim that Abdurahman Aliti is going to be 
the new PDP president.

<H5>  News Conference Scheduled but Not Held </H5>
  Yesterday a news conference was scheduled in the 
headquarters 
of the PDP, organized by the former Party President Nevzat 
Halili. At least that was the information delivered to the 
press. The journalists were there at the scheduled time, but 
Halili did not appear. The people in the PDP headquarters were 
surprised at the presence of the journalists, and nobody could 
give any explanation. 
  It was either because of false information given on Halili's 
behalf, his inability to send information to the PDP 
headquarters or his being unable to arrive at the scheduled time 
-- or was it perhaps a totally different reason?

<F P=106> [Commentary by Frane Plancic: "Montenegro Under Military </F>
Management?"] 
  [Text] Serbian plans for Montenegro have long been known, 
and they have long been implemented without any great problems, 
in cooperation with [President of Montenegro] Bulatovic and 
[Prime Minister] Djukanovic, the duo in power. What is not known 
are the Serbian plans for solving the expected secessionist 
crisis in Montenegro. However, there are certain indications of 
these plans, such as the deployment of the means for a 
preventative solution to this crisis by force, which have 
already been carried out. Naturally, the matter involves the 
Yugoslav Army (the Serbian armed forces), whose troops are on 
the alert because of the "constant danger from Croatia and 
Albania." 
  Belgrade is prepared to solve this "secessionist crisis" 
either by introducing martial law or by war. In either case, 
what Serbia must have is the following: territory clear of 
Albanians and Croats, a short period to apply armed force, 
achieved by deploying force on the crisis territories at the 
appropriate time, and, finally, to keep the situation on the 
borders with Albania and Croatia politically unstable, so that 
"internal intervention" could be covered and justified by 
external reasons. 
  The plans for the additional militarization of the Lustica 
peninsula (the Boka Kotorska bay), Valdinos cove (near Ulcinj), 
and Krnjicko Oko (on Lake Skadarsko) thus assume a clear 
political and military meaning. Belgrade's plan is accompanied 
by a request for building apartments for about 10,000 officers 
and their families. 
  Most of all this is being planned in eastern Herzegovina, 
densely populated by autochthonous Albanians. It clearly 
follows that "cleansing" is being planned. At the same time, 
Serbs are being settled in the area, so with additional 
militarization a favorable "balance of power" in relation to the 
Montenegrin "secessionists" is being achieved. The 
militarization of Lustica and the advanced cleansing of the 
autochthonous Croats in Boka is being guided by the same 
principle. 
  The decision to turn the Lustica peninsula into a military 
range and the construction of a naval port (base, stronghold) at 
Valdinos is primarily an open threat to Montenegrin sovereignty, 
and indirectly also to Croatia and Albania, since it is assumed 
that these countries will act aggressively toward Montenegrin 
territory. 
  The naval port of Valdinos does not only have a "land" 
purpose (threatening the Montenegrin secessionists), but its 
primary task is to hold the Serbian fleet that needs to secure 
for Belgrade a part in controlling the sea and the traffic in 
the wider Otranto area, especially when the lifting of the 
sanctions or a laxer regime of navigation and traffic is 
expected, as is constantly being announced in Belgrade. A more 
acceptable explanation has been put forward in the Montenegrin 
public -- that all this is a question of defense measures. 
  Viewed more passively, this represents the redeployment of 
the fleet from Boka, where the ships are within the range of 
Croatian weapons. Moreover, it would be difficult for the many 
different ships and submarines to sail out on time, fast, and in 
an orderly manner. 
  Valdinos Cove offers much better opportunities for active 
defense measures, at least insofar as it is further from Croatia 
and as it is easier to sail out of. However, all the other 
conditions are less favorable than those at Boka. This cove is 
only a mile long, the water 5 to 15 meters deep, and it is 
surrounded by hills that are, on average, two to three times 
lower than those at Boka, and open to strong winter winds. When 
one sails out of the cove, as is the case with Boka, the ships 
are in the open, at the mercy of a superior opponent from the 
air, the sea, or under the sea. Particular drawbacks are the 
fact that all the work has to be done from scratch (where will 
this kind of money come from?), that it will take a long time, 
and then there is also the hinterland with which Valdinos has 
very weak traffic and other connections. 
  After all, is the best indication not Belgrade silently 
overlooking the fact that Valdinos is not the best choice? 
There are several coves more appropriate for the purpose, but 
the "trouble" is that there is no Albanian or Croatian 
population there. 
  While talking to several senior Croatian Navy officials, we 
agreed that Montenegro (when it truly is Montenegro) will have 
the legitimate right to establish its own navy, in accordance 
with its defense needs, and also to take all passive and active 
security measures. However, they stated that the warships at 
Boka are neither Montenegrin property (but Serbian, while they 
are waiting for the division to be legally resolved), nor a 
factor of legitimate defense. Moreover, it is not such a bad 
thing that the Serbian fleet has been moving further away from 
our border. 
  It is quite another matter as to what will happen when 
Montenegro becomes the Republic of Montenegro, and when it has 
to defend itself on all sides against a spreading Belgrade 
aggression. The Slovenes, Croatians, Muslims, and Albanians had 
no other solution. It is therefore probably not necessary to 
point out that we are not dealing with fools and politically 
illiterate megalomaniacs such as Admiral Isakovic -- who 
addresses the people from The Galeb [formerly Tito's ship] in 
the manner of Tito -- but with clear-headed criminals who could 
be said to rank among the most notorious in the world.

  [Text] From the office of the president of Republic we have 
just received a report that Franjo Tudjman received U.S. 
Ambassador Madeleine Albright, accompanied by U.S. Ambassador to 
Croatia Peter Galbraith and John Shattuck, assistant secretary 
for human rights and humanitarian affairs. Expressing his 
satisfaction with the high-ranking guest's visit, President 
Tudjman said that the development of relations between the 
United States and Croatia was positive and stressed that 
democratic Croatia had been doing its best since its very 
beginning to forge as close as possible links with the United 
States, not only because of the 2 million Croatians living there 
but because U.S. democracy is an exemplary model for young 
democracies such as Croatia's. 
  Speaking about the situation in the UNPA [UN protected 
areas] 
and the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Tudjman reiterated Croatia's 
stands regarding a peaceful solution to the crisis in these 
areas. In this context he stressed that there would be a 
positive effect if the UN Security Council lent its firm support 
for the draft solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina proposed within 
the framework of the conference on the former Yugoslavia. He 
also pointed out that concordance [suglasnost] among the EU 
[European Union], United States, and United Nations was a 
serious precondition for efficiency and a quick end to the war 
in this area. The president also said that Croatia -- in 
keeping with its general democratic development and seeking 
solutions for the UNPA and Bosnia-Herzegovina -- was determined 
to protect human rights on a lasting basis. It will nevertheless 
bring those who threaten this development to account. 
  President Tudjman also expressed his deep gratitude to Mrs. 
Albright for her visit to Vukovar. Speaking about the horror 
she had seen in Vukovar in the heart of Europe, the ambassador 
said that the United States would do everything to punish the 
perpetrators. She also presented U.S. views on solving the 
situation in the UNPA. In this context she stressed that the 
United States supported the implementation of Resolution 871. 
In this respect she emphasized the importance of continuing 
sanctions against Serbia as well as the fact that these 
sanctions ought to be linked to reintegration of the UNPA into 
the system of the Republic of Croatia. Speaking about the 
situation in Bosnia, Mrs. Albright stressed that the United 
States was concerned over the fighting between the Croats and 
Muslims. She also emphasized the problem of delivering 
humanitarian aid to the suffering population of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The United States wants peace, stability, territorial 
integrity, and democracy in this region, the ambassador said and 
added that she hoped President Clinton's Partnership for Peace 
project would secure peace and stability in the region of 
Central and Eastern Europe and facilitate the incorporation of 
this entire region into the European order of democracy, peace, 
stability, market economy, and respect for human rights. Toward 
the end of the meeting, Ambassador Albright stressed that 
relations between the United States and the Republic of Croatia 
will remain good in the future too.

  [Text] The 34th session of the Presidential Defense and 
National Security Council was held today under the chairmanship 
of the Franjo Tudjman, president of the Republic. The Council 
discussed certain topical foreign and domestic policy issues, as 
well as economic subjects. 
  The Council was informed about the meeting yesterday [5 
January] between the Croatian and Bosnian delegations in Vienna 
and about preparations for the meeting between Presidents 
Tudjman and Izetbegovic scheduled for Saturday [8 January] in 
Bonn. 
  It was assessed that Croatia's international position and 
reputation were good -- moreover, owing to Croatia's very 
constructive role in the resolution of the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, that they were on the upswing. 
  Gratitude was expressed to the command of UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] which, at President Tudjman's request, had 
enabled [Zagreb Archbishop] Cardinal Kuharic and Croatian 
bishops to reach Sarajevo, where they attended the ordaining of 
the new auxiliary bishop of Sarajevo. 
  In connection with the publishing of certain classified 
information by the press, the Council entrusted several state 
bodies with the task of uncovering those responsible for 
divulging state secrets. 
  The participants in the session reiterated the Croatian 
leadership's stand on the consistent respect for legal 
regulations and on personal responsibility for the committing of 
crimes, but also warned that a person was innocent until proven 
guilty. It was particularly stressed that certain acts 
committed under wartime conditions should be viewed within the 
general context of the aggression against Croatia, and the fact 
that the war was being waged on Croatian soil where many Croats 
had been killed and towns and villages razed. Therefore, care 
should be taken that the reputation of the honorable 
participants in the war must not be tarnished as a consequence 
of irresponsible editorial practice and the actual misdeeds of 
individuals subject to criminal prosecution, the announcement 
issued by the Office of the President of the Republic says.

  [Text] Knin, Jan 6 (TANJUG) -- Croatia is preparing a new 
offensive on the Republic of Serb Krajina (RSK), the general 
staff of the republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) army warned Thursday. 
  The army statement said the Croatian army is reinforcing its 
positions, regrouping and bringing new troops into central 
Adriatic hinterland. The statement adds that the Christmas 
truce between the forces of the RSK and Croatia agreed at talks 
in Brussels on December 22 is mostly holding. 
  The Serbs declared the republic of Serb Krajina in 1991 in 
areas of the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia, where they are 
a majority population, in response to the secessionist policy of 
the Croatian authorities and their attempt to downgrade the 
Serbs from a constituent nation to a national minority. 
  Because of the ensuing clashes between the Krajina Serbs and 
the Croatian authorities, who do not recognize the RSK, Krajina 
was declared a UN Protected Area (UNPA). Nonetheless the 
Croatian army on three occasions, in June 1992 and in January 
and September last year, mounted offensives on the RSK killing 
and expelling the civilian population, looting, burning and 
destroying their homes.

  [Text] Zagreb, Jan 6 (AFP) -- Four Canadian peacekeepers 
were disarmed and held for several hours by Croatian soldiers 
who threatened the UN troops with their weapons, the UN 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) announced Thursday. General Jean 
Cot, the French soldier who commands UNPROFOR in the former 
Yugoslavia, described the incident Wednesday [5 January] as 
"outrageous" and demanded that the Croatian soldiers be punished. 
  The Canadian troops had obtained a routine authorisation to 
cross Croatian lines in the Medak enclave in the south of the 
country. Seven Croatian army soldiers approached them and 
ordered them to lay down their weapons before the Canadian 
soldiers were led away at gunpoint. UNPROFOR said the four were 
released after negotiations with a local Croatian commander. 
  Canada has 560 troops in the region based at Gracac. They 
were deployed in the Medak area after Croatian troops attacked 
Serb villages, massacring dozens of people.

  [Text] Warsaw, 5 Jan -- On Wednesday, President Lech Walesa 
accused the West of having its caution interpreted by Russia as 
a weakness, which virtually invites attempts to test its extent. 
In a statement for PAP on 5 January, the president also 
rejected the view, which is popular in the West, that Poland and 
other countries of the Visegrad group want to join NATO because 
they fear Russia. 
  Here is the full text of President Walesa's statement: 
  "A summit of NATO states is approaching. We will be watching 
it with particular attention and hope. It creates a chance that 
decisions made there will shape a new model of European security 
and contribute toward stimulating the rate of integration of the 
new continent. These have to be decisions which are considered 
but also bold. If the West avoids binding and forward-looking 
solutions, threats to European security will intensify. 
Idleness is a poor medicine against problems. 
  "Europe is wasting time. It is not making use of its 
historic opportunity. It is now four years since the `Autumn of 
the Nations,' since the great breakthrough in the postwar 
history of Europe, which was started by the Polish in August. 
Bloodless revolutions brought freedom to the peoples of central 
Europe. The Berlin Wall fell. The Warsaw Pact ceased to exist. 
The imperial Soviet Union fell apart, while on the ruins of the 
totalitarian system the previously enslaved peoples could 
rebuild their sovereignty. In the East new, independent states 
came into existence and democratization processes began. No 
more is there a confrontational system of opposing 
politico-military blocs which divided the continent and decided 
the shape of global politics. 
  "These are all victories of freedom and democracy. But they 
have not been utilized or cultivated. There has been no 
development or widening of security structures in Europe nor of 
economic structures. NATO and the European Community persist in 
the old shape and old habits, as if nothing significant has 
happened in east-central Europe, as if the collapse of communism 
changed nothing in the international configuration, as if the 
idea of the integration of the continent flagged as soon as it 
became possible to go over from words to deeds. 
  "Poland and other Visegrad Group states are applying for 
NATO 
and European Community membership -- not merely in their own 
interests -- because at stake is the prosperity of the whole of 
Europe, the gradual expansion of a stability and security zone 
on our continent. Our efforts are answered, for the time being, 
with vague promises. The West, however, should understand that 
by postponing the integration it is creating barriers for its 
own development and weakening its own security. He who stands 
still, moves backward. Meanwhile, the future is full of 
political, economic, migratory, and ecological challenges. You 
have to meet them half-way, broaden the scope for action, expand 
the possibilities. 
  "The view that the acceptance of new members to Western 
structures will weaken those structures is erroneous because it 
is shortsighted. It will be just the opposite: The final effect 
will be to strengthen these structures, and at the same a new 
stage in European integration will be opened. Legal standards, 
systemic norms, political culture, technological achievements 
must proceed across Europe from West to East, so that the zone 
of stability and prosperity can expand. This is the only recipe 
for a united and secure Europe. Other recipes, and especially 
egoistic idleness of the West, are leading to the East beginning 
to force its own solutions, which the West will not necessarily 
like. 
  "Life abhorrs a vacuum. It feels it spontaneously and this 
cannot be controlled. So let us not create a political and 
economic vacuum in the center of Europe, as it could turn out 
that its existence becomes a provocation for reestablishing the 
confrontational configuration from the past. 
  "I want to say clearly that we are not treating NATO and 
European Community membership as a panacea for our social and 
economic ills. We have no illusions of that kind. We also 
understand the need to begin adjustment activities and spread 
them in time. That is why we welcome with interest the U.S. 
Partnership for Peace initiative, with the reservation that the 
initiative, as a proposal for detailed and technical operations, 
should be preceded by the outlining of a specific vision of 
security in Europe. 
  "The West should not avoid outlining a vision of that kind 
and defining the role of NATO in the new international 
situation, as well as specifying political and military criteria 
for membership in the North Atlantic alliance, even if Russia 
opposes it. 
  "We understand the reasons why the West, and especially the 
United States, listens attentively to Russia's voice. We do not 
ignore it either, and we respect Russian concern for the 
integrity and nonconfrontational nature of the system of 
security in Europe. We are not so naive as to fail to 
understand that from the U.S. point of view the world looks 
somewhat different than it does from the Polish or even central 
European point of view. The United States is pursuing global 
policies and the Russian stake is one of the most important 
elements of those policies. Russia cannot fail to impress as a 
potential enemy, while at the same time giving rise to great 
hopes as a future -- free-market and democratic -- partner. 
  "We cannot, however, understand the conviction that is 
growing in the West, that an expansion of the stability zone in 
Europe, including decisive steps to expand NATO, would weaken 
democratic tendencies in Russia and strengthen imperial 
tendencies. I think that the demons which Zhirinovskiy 
personifies are growing in strength not because the West is 
pursuing a policy which is too active and too decisive but 
because it is not pursuing such a policy. Zhirinovskiy is 
indirectly a product of the West's idleness, the result of a 
lack of ideas, solutions, and visions. It is precisely because 
they are not there, or because they are unclear and unconvincing 
that Zhirinovskiy can spin his own terrifying visions, and the 
Russians are beginning to listen to him. 
  "The West wants to be cautious and does not want to bait the 
bear. Meanwhile, this caution is interpreted as weakness. From 
here it is but a step to a temptation to test its extent, to a 
policy of more or less refined extortion of more and more 
concessions. 
  "By the way, I would like to reject the view, which is 
popular in the West, that Poland and other Visegrad Group 
countries want to join NATO because they fear Russia. Poland is 
not afraid of Russia, neither in the sense of wanting to erect 
barriers against Russia, nor in the sense that Moscow could 
impose anything on or dictate anything to our homeland. We see 
Russia as a partner and expect partnerlike treatment. And it is 
in the new and mutually beneficial cooperation of Central Europe 
with Russia that we see one of the pillars of the European 
order. 
  "I believe that Russia, like the West, should think whether 
it perceives the issue of expanding NATO in the right 
perspective. Moscow believes that the acceptance of the Visegrad 
Group states to NATO will be a hostile step toward it, the step 
which isolates Russia with a cordon sanitaire. Maybe we should 
look at it differently -- NATO would come closer to the Russian 
borders not as an anti-Russian alliance, but as a zone of 
stability. NATO was created as a defensive alliance against the 
eastern bloc created by the USSR. There is no Soviet Union 
today, there is no Warsaw Pact. Could it be that Russia sees 
itself as a successor and a continuation of the USSR, since it 
perceives NATO as a structure unequivocally set against it? 
  "I profoundly hope that all these issues will be thoroughly 
analyzed at the NATO summit and that proper decisions will be 
made -- decisions outlining a concrete shape of security and 
prosperity for Europe and not half-measure decisions mainly 
calculated for biding time. I express this hope not just as 
president of the Polish Republic but also as a resident of a 
Europe that has already wasted enough time. Let us remember 
that history will not give us the same opportunity twice.''

  [Text] Warsaw, 5 Jan -- President Lech Walesa told a PAP 
journalist on 5 January that in his opinion only the combining 
of the U.S. plan for a "Partnership for Peace" with his 
proposals to "extend" Europe, meaning a fast integration of 
former communist countries with the European Community, 
including NATO, would guarantee "security and allow to see the 
sense of our victories." 
  Asked whether at the meeting in Prague he would be demanding 
from Clinton guarantees for Poland, the president replied: 
"Generally speaking, there is no threat here. A threat may 
appear and today such guarantees are not necessary, but 
tomorrow, unless we take steps which I have proposed, such 
guarantees will be ineffective." The president emphasized that, 
unless some things happen "guarantees, even if granted to us, 
will not be possible to implement." 
  When asked whether he thought that exerting pressure on the 
West with regard to NATO membership by the entire Visegrad 
Group, rather than doing this as separate members, would not be 
more effective, the president replied: "We are saying more or 
less the same thing. The problem is that for the time being we 
cannot say this with one voice. It is a bit odd, but perhaps it 
is a postcommunist illness...."

<F P=106> [Interview with Polish President Lech Walesa by </F>
correspondent David Cells in Warsaw on 5 January; from the BBC 
"Newsnight" program -- recorded; in Polish with superimposed 
English translation] 
  [Text] [Cells] Why does Poland want to become a NATO 
member? 
  [Walesa] Because it wants to protect and defend Europe, 
seeing European snobbery--seeing that it has not learned any 
lessons from history. Today Poland is trying to save Europe 
from mistakes like the ones made in 1939. We must not allow 
dangerous situations to develop. There are moments which have 
to be taken advantage of and not left till tomorrow. We did 
that in 1939, and we all paid the price. This again is one of 
those moments when we must not do that. We have achieved great 
victories, and these must be transformed into structural 
realities--political and military, as well as economic. 
  [Cells] What do you mean by European snobbery? 
  [Walesa] Europe thinks only of itself, only about the 
present. It has no sense of perspective, and it hasn't learnt 
anything from history. That's all very well for today. 
Tomorrow we'll all pay a high price as Europeans. I've learned 
from the past and look at what is happening now. I don't want 
us to make the same mistakes all over again. 
  [Cells] President Yeltsin changed his mind about Polish 
entry into NATO last year. Why, do you think? 
  [Walesa] He sensed the West's indecisiveness and its 
snobbery. He saw its lack of vision, and that is why he feels 
able to set conditions. You can set conditions for the weak, 
not the strong. You can set them when there is no vision, no 
direction. Yeltsin saw this and has taken advantage of it. 
  [Cells] What about domestic influences, the results of the 
elections, the rise of Zhirinovskiy? 
  [Walesa] Oh, that proves me right. Demons emerge when a 
country has no vision or direction. Mr. Zhirinovskiy is just 
such a demon. 
  [Cells] What do you think is wrong with President Clinton's 
offer of a partnership for peace, the gradual development of 
contacts between Poland and NATO? 
  [Walesa] It's a good idea, but you have to combine it with 
what I'm talking about: ideas and a vision for the future, but 
with a possibility of true partnership. You cannot be a real 
partner without being a shareholder. 
  [Cells] Aren't you afraid of there being a Russian sphere of 
influence in the East, and an American one in the West? 
  [Walesa] It's going exactly that way. We're heading toward 
recreating that confrontational system. We want to get out of 
it. We don't want to wake up the old demons. The American 
proposals are all very well, but at the moment, they're just 
proposals.

<F P=106> [Report by Hardy Kuehnrich on an interview with Polish </F>
President Lech Walesa; place and date not given; Walesa speaks 
in Polish with superimposed German translation -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Kuehnrich] These are Polish troops that belonged 
to the Warsaw Pact until a few years ago. The alliance is no 
longer in existence; and six months ago, the last Russian 
soldier left Poland. Now the Polish Army is preparing for NATO 
membership. Poland urgently wants to join, and the sooner the 
better. For the Polish people, the situation in their neighbor 
Russia is much too insecure. But the West hesitates. NATO 
membership is not within easy reach. On the eve of the NATO 
summit, Warsaw is being very clear. 
  [Walesa] By not letting us join NATO, the West is betraying 
and hurting itself. After the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union 
broke up, we thought that the West wanted a unified Europe, and 
real security. But all this is now being jeopardized by the 
West's position. This is why many people in our country feel 
much worse now than they used to. In the past, we hoped that 
there would be a unified Europe and equal rules. In reality, 
nothing has happened. There is even a chance that the old 
forces could regain their strength. What have we achieved? 
  [Kuehnrich] Poland's NATO membership aspirations have been 
the number one topic in the country for weeks. Poland wants to 
be part of the West, part of Europe. The polemics in the media 
are getting sharper. The critical point being discussed is that 
the West makes allowances for Yeltsin. But Russia is a country 
that is not trusted in Poland. Experiences from the past have 
not been forgotten: Others determined the country's future. 
Poland once again feels like a buffer zone, and what is more, 
it feels that it is not being granted equal rights. 
  [Walesa] We are looking at things that the West can see as 
well, but is trying to overlook. But we will not allow Russia 
to make conditions for us to meet. Russia is setting conditions 
for NATO and the West. I get the impression that we no longer 
have to ask NATO or Clinton, but we should go and ask Yeltsin 
because he controls the West and NATO. 
  [Kuehnrich] How do you see Germany's position regarding 
Poland's wish to join NATO? Is it a clear position? 
  [Walesa] The Germans are in a difficult position. One has 
to understand this; and I understand the Germans. They still 
have the Russian Army on their territory. They also face 
problems related to unification and various other difficulties. 
Germany is watched by everybody, and one, therefore, should not 
be surprised about the hesitant attitude taken by the Germans. 
[end recording] 
  Reproaches are being directed toward the West, and worried 
looks go across the border into Russia. The fact is that the 
majority of Poles are in favor of a quick alliance with Western 
Europe and NATO.

  [Text] Warsaw, 4 Jan -- Deputy Prime Minister Marek 
Borowski defended on Tuesday [4 January] the left-wing image of 
the present government and the draft budget for the coming year 
against criticism from the participants of a conference 
organized by the Labor Union [UP] parliamentary floor group. 
  According to Borowski, the measures implemented by Waldemar 
Pawlak's government are proof of its left-wing nature. "The 
attitude to the issue of participation of the state in economic 
life is also a social-democratic element," the deputy prime 
minister said. He also emphasized that "a transition from a 
liberal to a left-wing government is not easy because this is 
the first such transformation attempt in any Central European 
country." 
  Borowski rejected the accusations, mainly from UP Chairman 
Ryszard Bugaj, that there is a continuation of the monetarist 
policy, and that he maintained a "small budget" and "the 
privatisation principle." "This budget slows down certain 
trends but does not overcome them; we have to continue the 
privatization process because the state cannot manage 6,000 
companies," Borowski said. 
  The deputy prime minister also disagreed with Sejm Deputy 
Wieslawa Ziolkowska, who said that this year's budget does not 
bring Poland closer to the European Union [EU]. According to 
Borowski the situation is just the opposite because the budget 
is aimed at curbing inflation, which is one of the conditions 
for membership in the EU. 
  At the meeting Borowski listened to papers delivered by 
several dozen academics on social policy and economic issues.

<F P=106> [From the "Wiadomosci" evening news bulletin; relayed by TV </F>
Polonia] 
  [Text] After a meeting of the leaders of the government 
coalition, Aleksander Kwasniewski said that Prime Minister 
Waldemar Pawlak had stuck to his promise of introducing deputy 
ministers from the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and the Democratic 
Left Alliance [SLD] to the presidential ministries. The prime 
minister did not confirm this news. Minister of National 
Defense Piotr Kolodziejczyk has declared that he will tender his 
resignation if the coalition introduces political deputy 
ministers into his ministry. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Maciej Sojka] A month ago, 
in the course of a meeting of the SLD Supreme Council, 
Aleksander Kwasniewski stated that he agreed with Waldemar 
Pawlak that each of the coalition parties would introduce one 
deputy minister into the ministries of foreign affairs, internal 
affairs, and national defense. Unofficially, it is known that 
the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has agreed to this, 
on condition that these will be people already working in his 
ministry. The minister of internal affairs also said, during a 
meeting with journalists of the GLOS SZCZECINSKI daily, that he 
is not surprised by such a proposal. On the other hand, the 
president protested strongly. Just a few days ago, SLD 
politicians stated that to avoid provoking a conflict with the 
Belweder Palace, Waldemar Pawlak will withdraw the nomination of 
the deputy ministers. In the view of Aleksander Kwasniewski, in 
the course of the meeting today Waldemar Pawlak stuck to the 
earlier decisions. 
  [Correspondent] Prime Minister Pawlak agreed? 
  [Kwasniewski] He did not have to agree, he agreed a long 
time 
ago, and we will be implementing this. 
  [Correspondent] So he again maintained this today? 
  [Kwasniewski] That is so. [end recording] 
  [Sojka] The head of the Ministry of National Defense has 
announced that he will not agree to the introduction of deputy 
ministers from the SLD and PSL, since, as he put it, the army 
does not need political commissars. 
  [Defense Minister Kolodziejczyk] I will be considering our 
moves, together with a possible tendering of my resignation. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, will you agree to the 
nomination of deputy ministers in the presidential ministries? 
Mr. Kwasniewski said that you agree. Is this true? [video 
shows Pawlak walking down corridor without answering] 
  [Sojka] Ewa Wachowicz, press secretary for the prime 
minister, affirmed that the issue of filling deputy ministerial 
posts in the presidential ministries is a marginal topic for the 
prime minister. [end recording]

Cooperation appointment of Ireneusz Sekula to the presidency of 
the Main Customs Office (GUC) has resulted in a number of

issue of WPROST. The Poznan weekly writes that GUC's former

and entrepreneur" Ireneusz Sekula, who is an advocate of 
lowering customs duties in order to make smuggling less 
attractive and thus increase customs revenues. 
  WPROST also reports that the 50-year-old Sekula completed 
his 
studies for a master's degree in psychology in 1965 at the 
University of Warsaw, where he later earned a doctorate in 
political science. Following a stint with the Polish Scout Union 
(ZHP), he began his professional career in state administration, 
working for the Ministry of Industrial Machinery and the 
Ministry of Labor, Wages, and Social Service Affairs. From 1983 
to 1988, he was president of the Social Security Agency (ZUS). 
Sekula was minister of labor and social policies in Zbigniew 
Messner's government (mid-198O's) and served as deputy premier 
in Mieczyslaw Rakowski's government (the last communist 
government, which preceded the Mazowiecki government of 1989). 
From 1966 to 1990, Sekula was a member of the ruling communist 
party, the Polish United Workers Party, and currently belongs to 
Social Democracy of the Polish Republic (SdRP), where he serves 
on the Executive Council. Sekula has been a deputy in the last 
three Sejms: the last Sejm that included communists, elected in 
1989, and the Sejms elected in 1991 and 1993--in the latter two 
representing the Democratic Left Alliance, of which the SdRP is 
a leading partner.

  [Text] Bihac, 6 Jan (TANJUG) -- According to the Muslim 
controlled media, inter-Muslim clashes are continuing in 
Cazinska Krajina. The same sources claim that armed clashes are 
taking place along the entire demarcation line and, in 
particular, near Trsce and Trzacki Rasteli, but they do not 
mention losses. 
  According to the western Bosnia news agency ZBIA, the 503d 
and 517th Cazin brigades [loyal to Izetbegovic] are in disarray 
after a large number of their officers and command personnel 
joined the army of the autonomous province of western Bosnia. 
This was confirmed by Nevzad Djeric, commander of the 503d 
Cazin brigade, who has also joined the ranks of Abdic's army. 
  According to the same source, about 1,000 people from 
Pecigrad, the largest residential area of Cazin, have moved to 
Velika Kladusa to join Fikret Abdic and flee the terror 
committed by the extremists in the 5th Corps of the so-called 
Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its commander, Atif Dudakovic. 
  Muslim-controlled Bihac radio has named Bozdar Sicel, deputy 
chairman of the assembly of the autonomous province of Western 
Bosnia, as being most responsible for recruiting the 503d and 
517th Brigades for Abdic's army and for persuading the large 
section of Pecigrad population to change sides. 
  Bihac radio also reported that clashes continue in Bihac 
between Muslims and the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] under the 
command of Major General Vlado Santic, as do clashes between the 
HVO and the Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ] headed by Dr. Ante 
Santic, Vlado's brother. According to Bihac radio, there are 
dead and wounded on both sides, but neither side has so far 
reported any casualties.

<F P=106> [Interview with Josef Lux, chairman of the Christian and </F>
Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party, by Roman 
Krasnicky; place and date not given: "Our Voters Do Not Have To 
Attend Church Services"] 
  [Text] Josef Lux, chairman of the Christian and 
Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party, rules out the 
possibility that his party could, in the future, receive less 
than 5 percent of votes: We will always be a parliamentary 
party, he says. 
  [Krasnicky] How stable is the coalition after 18 months of 
existence? 
  [Lux] Just as it was at the beginning. It will last for the 
entire electoral term. 
  [Krasnicky] The Civic Democratic Party [ODS] represents 30 
percent of all voters, your party just 6 percent. The ODS 
members dominate the Cabinet. Does their greater responsibility 
imply also a greater "right" to enforce their views? 
  [Lux] I reject any deliberation on diverse responsibilities. 
It is the same in the coalition. The only difference is in 
strength. The ODS is the strongest in the coalition, and it also 
uses the strength. The equality of the parties is given by the 
coalition treaty. If equality of the parties did not exist, we 
could speak not about a coalition but about a vassalage. The 
fundamental issues must be accepted by all coalition parties. 
  [Krasnicky] At the Olomouc congress of the Christian 
Democratic Party [KDS], you delivered a speech that has been 
favorably viewed by the KDS members. Is an association of the 
two parties feasible? 
  [Lux] It is true that I felt as if I was among good friends 
at the KDS conference. We have the same ideological basis, the 
same world view.... If I compare our policy statement with the 
KDS program, it is difficult to distinguish any substantial 
differences. Therefore, I see a lot of room for practical 
cooperation at all levels. The need for this cooperation is even 
more urgent if we realize that the Christian democratic concept 
of politics truly is the universal political alternative to all 
socialist and liberal egotist models. I hope that together we 
will be able to push through our model. I myself have two 
ambitions: first, to prove to people that it is not necessary 
for them to attend church services to be able to vote for a 
party with a Christian democratic program, as the propaganda is 
trying to make them believe, and second, that social regard and 
solidarity are not prerogatives of the left wing but, rather, 
are characteristic for us. 
  [Krasnicky] Public opinion surveys regularly attribute to 
you 
relatively few votes near the magic 5-percent limit. Does it 
make you uneasy? Do you believe that the third time around, in 
the 1996 parliamentary elections, you will be lucky again and 
manage to keep slightly above the limit? 
  [Lux] We do not feel at all uneasy. We work according to our 
concept, holding the entire four-year electoral cycle in 
perspective. The mistrust in election results that you indicated 
is based purely on lack of knowledge of our party. No other 
party has dared to advocate, at first sight, so many unpopular 
issues as ours. One instance is agriculture. Some people 
whispered to me: Do not touch the farmers; you would lose 
traditional voters. I am convinced that it is necessary for this 
country to reduce the number of farmers by 50 percent, as is 
usual in the world, and therefore I am pushing through certain 
measures. Similarly, I refused to continue the practice of 
granting subsidies from the state treasury to private farmers 
and for each hectare. If they farmed individually, those 5- and 
10-hectare farmers would soon go bankrupt anyway because such 
small farms cannot be competitive. I told them this immediately. 
Many have held it against me until today, but most understood 
that this saved them from the unhappy fate of bankrupts, and 
they will further combine in larger partnerships.

<F P=106> [New Year's Address delivered by President Michal Kovac in </F>
Bratislava on 1 January 1994] 
  [Text] Fellow citizens, from time immemorial the New Year 
has always been an opportunity for settling personal, 
family-related, and social problems. Since January 1993, the New 
Year has assumed a new importance to us, being the anniversary 
of the establishment of our state. This gives us an opportunity 
to reflect upon the first year of our lives in an independent 
state and, above all, to consider what our country needs and how 
we, all of us, can help our country. Our historical experience 
teaches us that our statehood is one of the most important 
guarantees of our national freedom and of our fully fledged 
national life, for which it is worth fighting and making the 
greatest sacrifices. 
  For a long time, we lived in the shadow of others more 
powerful. Many of us doubted whether we would be able to rule 
ourselves, whether our own statehood made any sense, whether it 
had a real value, and whether it was not an excessive luxury for 
Slovaks. 
  Many of us were afraid that our new state would not be 
internationally recognized. We were afraid that we would not be 
able to quickly build the state institutions needed for the 
existence of our independent republic. 
  Today, we can see that these catastrophic predictions have 
not come true. According to these predictions, Slovakia would 
have been unable to avoid certain catastrophes. However, we are 
not hiding the fact that the new situation demands certain 
sacrifices. The peaceful and civilized partition of the Czech 
and Slovak Federal Republic has given us a good starting point 
for a promising future. 
  In a short time, the Slovak Republic has been recognized by 
most sovereign states, including all of the great powers. This 
testifies to the fact that the international community has fully 
respected the right of the Czech and the Slovak nations to 
establish their own states. This community has expressed trust 
in them and met them halfway. 
  We, in the interests of peace and security in Europe, have 
embraced cooperation with all democratic nations and countries. 
Our objective is to jointly establish political, cultural, and 
economic prosperity in Europe and the world. This is the way we 
want to proceed in the future. Our democratic Constitution is 
our fundamental guarantee of civil rights and freedoms, as 
declared and demanded by hundreds of thousands of people in 
November 1989. For the first time in our modern history, we have 
become the architects of our own destiny. We ourselves have 
decided to establish our own state, as the historical 
development required or even dictated. The existence of the 
Slovak Republic is an undisputable fact. Those who accepted its 
establishment with nostalgia should understand it and respect 
it. Certain situations are unique and do not repeat themselves. 
We have taken the opportunity offered to us by history. Our task 
is to build this state as a common state of all of its people, 
irrespective of their nationality or religious and political 
affiliations, and to secure democracy, freedom, and legal order, 
so that the law may prevail over willfulness and 
unscrupulousness, and responsibility over impunity and 
corruption. I call upon everyone to participate in that work. It 
is our right, our duty, and our common interest. 
  Our democracy must become a modern civic democracy in which 
the plurality of political parties, coexistence of the 
government and the opposition, and freedom for all must be 
secured. However, freedom means responsibility. We cannot 
tolerate freedom in the sense of an anarchic destruction of 
authorities and constitutional institutions, or the freedom to 
set various groups in society against one another. We will 
defend, as far as we can, our statehood, sovereignty, freedom, 
independence, and territorial integrity. 
  The quick completion of our central state organization and 
institutions, the establishment of our Army, and the 
introduction of a separate currency, which we did not have 
before our state was established, are very important for our 
present existence and our future. 
  I believe it is exceptionally important and encouraging 
that, 
now that the unified economic space we shared with the Czech 
Republic has been divided, the Slovak economy and currency have 
not collapsed. According to an international comparison giving 
the most important economic indicators, the Slovak Republic 
ranks second or third among the postcommunist countries. This 
should not be overestimated, but it certainly should not be 
belittled or ignored, either. I have been delighted that, apart 
from the newly established state institutions, hundreds of civic 
initiatives, associations, and nongovernmental organizations, 
usual in developed societies, have been registered in the first 
year. It is precisely in these organizations that civic activity 
should be concentrated and creative abilities provided by the 
democratic system utilized. Here we have opportunities to 
provide charity and assistance and express understanding and 
sympathy, which are features that give a human face to our 
society. 
  Despite all of the mistakes and serious problems, I can 
proudly say that independent Slovakia has withstood the test in 
the first year of its state sovereignty. I want to thank the 
government, parliament, all state and public officials, and 
mayors of the cities for all of this. I want to sincerely thank 
all of you, my fellow citizens, for the patience and 
understanding that you showed last year. You know quite well 
that we not only had to face our lack of political culture, but 
also to get rid of bad habits and ailments inherited from the 
totalitarian system. We have inherited an extremely inconvenient 
economic structure and devastating way of thinking and morale. I 
appreciate that most of you have contributed to alleviating the 
difficulties and creating a gradual renewal of a peaceful and 
sensible life. My sincere thanks also go to all who are working 
without profit on the spiritual and moral revival of our society. 
  We are proud of our artists, scientists, sportsmen, 
producers 
of top-of-the-line products, and others who help to spread 
Slovakia's good reputation abroad. 
  Dear fellow citizens, if I have evaluated the first year of 
our state existence positively, it does not mean that I am 
satisfied with the results we have achieved. I am convinced that 
they could have been better in both the material and the 
spiritual spheres, especially with respect to the general social 
atmosphere and our life-style. We could have avoided various 
political feuds, unnecessary stress, and various scandals. All 
of this disappointed many people and caused them to stop 
trusting in politics and politicians and to lose drive and 
optimism. 
  I am saying with pain in my heart that I believe that many 
difficulties have been caused by our failure to mobilize and 
unify all of the political and nonpolitical forces in our 
society, with the objective of jointly solving our essential 
problems. We did not try to find out what our errors were but 
pointed to the errors of others. We did not try to find 
ourselves allies but preferred to discover adversaries and 
enemies to be blamed for everything. Fortunately, we do not have 
too many parties in parliament, which made it easier to join our 
political forces. However, we did not succeed in establishing a 
coalition that would be able to secure the necessary stability 
of the government, or, at least, productive cooperation between 
political entities. 
  It would be our tragedy if we thought that all of our 
important problems would be solved by capable and strong 
individuals. Today we know that a successful solution to our 
problems requires cooperation between dozens or hundreds of 
brains, if not thousands or hundreds of thousands. We need a 
government with a wider coalition that would mobilize the best 
brains of our society so as to solve its main problems and carry 
out its main tasks. 
  Personal animosities must not hamper the formation of such a 
government. People who have the necessary knowledge and ability 
to cooperate decently with their colleagues should be appointed 
to such a government. This is why I appeal to the leading 
representatives of the parliamentary parties, movements, their 
elected bodies, and ordinary members to seek the appropriate 
personalities from among their ranks. When carrying out this 
task, we must put Slovakia's interests before the interests of 
individuals, parties, and movements. A broad coalition 
government must be based on the results of the last elections, 
in which the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia won a majority. 
  It would be a very unfortunate situation if the 
parliamentary 
parties were based on one person and fell along with that 
person. Slovakia now needs political stability, conditions for 
peaceful and productive work, an atmosphere of tolerance, 
understanding, and goodwill. The key to solving our problems 
lies in cooperation among our parliamentary political parties 
and not in confrontation, in stretching our partnership and not 
in putting some people above others, in intensifying our mutual 
trust and respect and not in suspecting and accusing others, not 
in radicalization but in moderation and temperance. Our 
responsibility for Slovakia's destiny dictates that we should 
put an end to government-drafted makeshift solutions and 
improvisations and try, using all democratic and peaceful means, 
to establish political stability and a stable government that 
would also be trusted abroad. This is a condition for being able 
to focus on the uncompromising fight against unemployment and 
the growing crime rate, disorder, lack of discipline, and 
injustice. This is the basic prerequisite for improving our 
trustworthiness abroad and renewing the trust of people in our 
politics and the correctness of the road upon which we have 
embarked. 
  Dear fellow citizens, we are entering a year that the United 
Nations has declared to be the International Year of the Family. 
Even though our country is in a difficult situation, we must not 
allow the human, spiritual, and cultural level of families to 
decline. As head of state, I will demand that state bodies help 
to create a social climate that stimulates a peaceful and 
harmonious family life, the protection of children and elderly 
people, and the sound development of the younger generation. I 
will require that a state program be established to support 
young families, which would help satisfy at least their basic 
needs in housing and starting their new lives. 
  We are obliged to provide young families with a way out of 
today's unpleasant situation. No one except parents can assume 
the role of the mother or the father, however. This is why I 
appeal to you, dear parents: Give more love to your children and 
be a good example to them. It is in the interests of your sons 
and daughters, and also in your own. 
  It is very important to ask: What do we still lack for a 
humane, respectable, and happy life? Material welfare or 
humanity, mutual trust, love, respect, and other spiritual 
values? 
  I know that a decent human life requires adequate material 
conditions. This is why we are vehemently implementing economic 
transformation and trying to improve the output of our economy. 
Our efforts must not fade away. 
  I am convinced that we need more human values. A peaceful, 
balanced, and happy life is impossible without them. It will 
depend on ourselves how much effort we exert to secure material 
welfare and how much to secure spiritual and human education. 
The more we concentrate on doing our daily work well, the more 
we will help, indirectly, to create the material prerequisites 
for a decent human life. 
  We all have the opportunity to do good and contribute to a 
rapid improvement in the conditions of our lives. There are 
indeed people among us who need, for various reasons, the help 
of others. But the rest should not rely on someone else's help 
to improve their material and spiritual lives. Without their own 
diligence, it would be immoral to demand better material and 
spiritual conditions of life. 
  Doing good cannot be replaced by anything. We only have to 
want to do good. Please, my fellow citizens, try to reflect upon 
my words and let us try to change our daily lives. It is worth 
the pain! 
  Apart from democracy, mutuality, love, tolerance, and 
goodwill are the great riches in every society. Let us protect 
them and improve them. 
  Dear fellow citizens, at the very beginning of the New Year, 
it would be the most simple thing to wish you a happy New Year, 
better than the one preceding. However, I know that particularly 
in economic life there will be no essential reversal. Our 
situation is complicated but not desperate. We have many reasons 
to face the future with real optimism. Everyday we become more 
convinced that our people are highly educated, that we have 
capable scientists, comparable technological experience, and 
responsible and industrious people. We are quickly acquiring 
managerial and entrepreneurial skills and learning foreign 
languages. We have the opportunity to embrace international 
cooperation and experience. However, we lack sound 
self-confidence. I have to take this opportunity to address the 
churches, the cultural and educational institutions, the 
intelligentsia, the publishers, the mass media and the teachers, 
and to ask them to help as much as they can to create a sound 
basis for our future life, to strengthen political and civic 
stability, the mental health and harmonious life of the family. 
Only than will we be able to look calmly into the future. 
Building a state, the foundations of which we have already laid, 
is like building a home in which our family will live. If we 
have sound and prosperous families, our state, too, will be 
sound and prosperous. All that we do for the harmonious and 
sound development of our families will become our most precious 
contribution to a better and new future for all of us. So help 
us God. 
  In this spirit I greet you, fellow countrymen, brothers and 
sisters, who live dispersed all over the world, and wish you 
Happy New Year for 1994, good health, optimism, unity, and trust 
in yourself and your country.

  [Text] Jagodina, 6 Jan (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, 
president of the assembly of the republic of Srpska, stated for 
Jagodina Radio this evening that in talks in Belgrade yesterday 
between Slobodan Milosevic, international mediators Owen and 
Stoltenberg, and representatives of the republic of Srpska, an 
agreement was reached that enables the peace process to be 
brought to an end on 18 January in Geneva. 
  By this, conditions have been created for lifting the 
sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Krajisnik 
said. 
  "The Serb side yesterday confirmed its readiness for Muslims 
to be given 33.3 percent of former Bosnia-Herzegovina territory, 
and accepted a proposal that in the next two years the province 
of Sarajevo, including its nine municipalities, be administered 
by the United Nations, during which time a final solution for 
Sarajevo will be found." 
  "The third thing that we discussed yesterday was our demand 
for access to the sea in the area of Molunat and Prevlaka. The 
last demand by the European Union and the Muslims has been 
fulfilled by our acceptance of the percentage of territory to be 
given to the Muslims and of the status of Sarajevo; therefore 
there is no reason not to abolish the sanctions against the Serb 
people," Krajisnik said. 
  If the negotiations on 18 January in Geneva do not yield 
result, it will be clear that the Muslim side is to blame, 
Momcilo Krajisnik said.

"Visegrad in Vain?"] 
  [Text] It is already known that President Bill Clinton's 
Prague meeting with the heads of state of Poland, Hungary, the 
Czech Republic, and Slovakia is not going to be a Visegrad 
summit. It is mainly the Czechs who did not want the meeting to 
be granted such a status. The Poles and Hungarians are losing 
hope. 
  President Clinton will arrive for the Prague meeting 
straight 
from the NATO summit in Brussels. The only event to underline 
the regional nature of this meeting will be a two-hour working 
lunch on 12 January, attended by the five presidents. 
  "It was clear form the very outset that there would be four 
meetings with the U.S. President, independent of each other," 
said Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, who announced that the 
Czechs are accepting the U.S. "Partnership for Peace" proposal. 
He expressed surprise about speculation that the Czech Republic 
was opposing joint talks by the Visegrad heads of state with 
Clinton. 
  A high-ranking Foreign Ministry official even told me that 
the era of joint Visegrad action was over. The "Partnership for 
Peace" proposal calls for independent action, and that is why 
Prague finds it attractive. 
  Yesterday, Vaclav Klaus said that during Clinton's visit 
there would be bilateral talks by the Visegrad prime ministers, 
and after the U.S. guest's departure each of the three hosts 
would treat his opposite numbers to supper. The presidents will 
eat at the Hradschin, the prime ministers at the Liechtenstein 
Palace (seat of the government), and the foreign ministers at 
the Czernin Palace (seat of the Foreign Ministry). Care has been 
taken to exclude the risk of any joint stance being formulated. 
  The reaction from Warsaw has been unexpectedly calm. "We 
will not force our will on the rest," a senior Polish official 
told me. "Perhaps the Visegrad Group is not in Poland's 
interests." Only President Walesa's spokesman, Andrzej 
Drzycimski, has made any attempt to assuage anxieties, saying 
that consultations were being held both with the United States 
and the Czech Republic. In his opinion, the Belvedere is still 
doing all it can to prevent more than one speech on behalf of 
the Visegrad Group at the joint Prague lunch, instead of four 
separate speeches. Slovak President Michal Kovac said yesterday 
that on Tuesday, President Walesa had suggested to him and the 
other Visegrad presidents the submission to President Clinton of 
a joint proposal for Visegrad integration with NATO. Kovac 
agreed. The Hungarians as well. But the Czechs did not. 
  Yesterday, Vice Foreign Minister Andrzej Ananicz created the 
impression that he had no faith in a Visegrad-Clinton meeting. 
"One cannot imagine what a joint talk between five presidents 
would look like. As it is, each of them will have one hour in 
which to talk to the Americans," he said. 
  One of our interlocutors, talking about the three lunches to 
be held following Clinton's departure, said: "These might be 
the farewell lunches of Visegrad."

  [Excerpt] We have just received the latest report from 
Bonn. Jozo Curic has the latest news. 
  [Curic] The second round of talks between Presidents Tudjman 
and Izetbegovic ended several minutes ago. The talks were 
initiated by the Croats, and I have learned from well-informed 
sources that the talks followed the old pattern. The Muslims 
accept Croatian peace and cooperation proposals in general but 
reject individual specific elements. Presidents Izetbegovic and 
Tudjman will meet briefly tomorrow morning and this will be 
followed by a plenary meeting. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Jozo Culic in Bonn] </F>
  [Excerpt] The third round of the talks -- initiated by the 
Croats -- began in Bonn at 0900 today [10 January]. Presidents 
Tudjman and Izetbegovic, Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic, 
Mile Akmadzic, foreign minister of the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna, and adviser Martic and others are continuing their 
talks on a cease-fire, the delineation of borders, access to the 
sea at Ploce, and mutual Croat-Muslim relations in the future. 
  The details of the Croatian text -- in which Zagreb, we have 
learned from well-informed sources, is seeking 17.5 percent of 
the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina for the Croats in the Croat 
republic of Herceg-Bosna and is not allowing the Muslims in any 
way to take control of Neum -- have not been made public. 
  Izetbegovic last night agreed in principle to the Croat 
proposal that offers peace, but the Muslims are very tough when 
it comes to the details. It seems that the Muslims have 
objections regarding Mostar; in central Bosnia they are seeking 
to obtain virtually everything for themselves, and access to the 
sea is unresolved as far as they are concerned. [passage

  [Excerpts] Bonn, Jan 10 (AFP) -- Bilateral peace talks 
between Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic and Croatia's 
Franjo Tudjman resumed here Monday [10 January] behind closed 
doors, diplomats said. [passage omitted] 
  The mediators Lord Owen for the European Community and 
Thorvald Stoltenberg for the United Nations are attending the 
talks, which are aimed at reaching a ceasefire between the two 
sides in central Bosnia and agreeing on the shape of a future 
Bosnian state. [passage omitted] 
  Germany is hosting the talks but Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel has stressed it is not acting as a mediator. 
  The Croatian press in Zagreb said Tudjman had informed 
Izetbegovic that he would ask "to use force against those 
carrying out offensives" in Bosnia if their summit in Bonn 
failed. Tudjman referred specifically to the new government 
army offensive around Vitez and Busovaca in central Bosnia, 
which Croat military sources say began Sunday. 
  According to the Croatian press, Tudjman presented 
Izetbegovic with "a formal Croatian proposal for a global 
settlement" of relations between Bosnian Croats and Moslems and 
between Bosnia and Croatia. 
  "If these negotiations do not yield results, Croatia will 
ask 
the United Nations, the European Union and NATO to use force 
against all those carrying out offensives," Tudjman is reported 
to have said in the presence of Kinkel, Owen and Stoltenberg.

<F P=106> [Report by Nada al-Isa from Bonn] </F>
  [Text] After a two-day delay the Croatian-Bosnian talks 
are in progress in Bonn. Presidents Izetbegovic and Tudjman are 
discussing three problems: halting the conflict between Croats 
and Muslims in central Bosnia, access to the sea near Neum, and 
the status of Mostar. We have learned from sources in our 
delegation that some new initiatives have been proposed, 
primarily regarding access to the sea near Neum. We have 
learned that, according to the Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation's 
proposal, both Neum and Mostar will be under European control 
for a period of two years. This means in practice that access 
to the sea near Neum will be joint, neither Croatian nor 
Bosnian, but both Croatian and Bosnian. 
  Mostar, like Sarajevo, will be an open city, but under 
European control. Under no circumstances can Mostar be the 
capital of the so-called Herceg-Bosnia or Croatian republic. 
The Croats will be allowed to have the seats of some of their 
(?institutions) in it. However, let me repeat, Mostar will not 
be the capital of the Croatian republic. This means that it 
will formally not be a part of any of the republics in the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina union, but it will belong to everyone. This 
is actually the solution recently proposed in Vienna by Prime 
Minister Silajdzic when he said: Mostar for Mostar's citizens. 
If the European governors manage to organize their authority in 
a satisfactory way, this will mean exactly that: All Mostar 
citizens will be able to return to their Mostar. 
  Let me just mention that, in addition to the two presidents, 
Izetbegovic and Tudjman, the other members of the 
Croatian-Bosnian delegations are Foreign Minister Irfan 
Ljubijankic, Presidency member Ivo Komsic, and Muhamed 
Sacirebey, Bosnia-Herzegovina ambassador to the United Nations, 
on the Bosnian side, and Foreign Minister Mate Granic on the 
Croatian side. The so-called Herceg-Bosnia is being represented 
by Mile Akmadzic. Therefore, Mate Boban is not present. Does 
this mean that a great obstacle to the peace negotiations has 
been removed? Well-informed sources and politicians claim that 
Mr. Boban is already an ex-politician and Zagreb's ex-pet. 
  This has been Nada al-Isa reporting from Germany for Radio 
Television Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Excerpts] The Christian Democrats [SKD] are not yet 
satisfied with the hitherto results of the negotiations about 
the coordination of opinions regarding the passing of the 
constitutional law. Therefore, they cannot support the changes 
to the constitutional law yet. Miroslav Mozetic told this at a 
regular news conference of the Christian Democrats today. He 
also said that the party is preparing for all possibilities 
envisaged by the Law of Local Self-Rule, which regulates the 
elections into new or old communes. Gojko Brvar reports: 
  [Begin Brvar recording] [passage omitted] The party holds a 
well-established opinion regarding the affiliation of the 
center-oriented political parties, which the party's secretary 
general, Edvard Stanic, repeated today. The affiliation of the 
political parties is a necessity on the Slovene political scene. 
The political field is thus narrowing and becoming more 
definitive. [passage omitted] 
  The affiliation on the right is still characterized by the 
relations between the Peoples' Party and the Christian 
Democrats. After numerous offers of the Slovene Christian 
Democrats, a public initiative for wider affiliation came from 
the Peoples' Party just before the New Year. The Christian 
Democrats have heard it with interest, but expect that they will 
nevertheless get an answer to their earlier initiatives. 
Namely, the Slovene Peoples' Party still has not responded to 
the last initiative, which was suggested at a personal level by 
the president, leader of the club of deputies, and secretary 
general of the Christian Democrats. 
  When asked how would the Christian Democrats view a possible 
Social Democrat [SDSS] withdrawal from the government coalition, 
Edvard Stanic did not give a direct answer. Indirectly, he 
hinted that a withdrawal of one coalition partner would not 
necessarily result in the withdrawal of the Christian Democrats.

  [Text] Yesterday, in Milwaukee, U.S. Vice President Al 
Gore made a statement in connection with the U.S. President's 
upcoming tour of certain European states and the NATO summit 
meeting to take place in Brussels. 
  We asked the spokesman of Romania's Presidency, Mr. Traian 
Chebeleu, to comment on that statement. Chebeleu said, "we 
learned with interest and satisfaction about the statement made 
by Mr. Al Gore, vice president of the United States of America. 
We consider that statement to be a clear expression of the U.S. 
stance, having the value of a pledge, in the sense of which, 
Romania's security, as well as the security of all other 
countries in this part of Europe, is not indifferent to the 
United States. We consider that statement as a major support for 
the efforts we are making to strengthen the stability and 
security of our country in the context of the convulsions taking 
place in our vicinity and, on a broader plane, to strengthen 
Romania's democratic society." 
  The statement made by the presidential spokesman to our 
radio 
also points out that the position expressed by the U.S. vice 
president responds to our preoccupations and was made in the 
spirit of the recent message addressed by Romania's president to 
the President of the United States and the other heads of states 
that are members of NATO.

  [Text] During a news conference held yesterday, Mr. 
Nicolae Manolescu, chairman of the Civic Alliance Party [PAC], 
announced that representatives of the parties that are members 
of the Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] will meet with 
Romania's President Ion Iliescu on Tuesday, 11 January. 
  During the news conference held yesterday by the leaders of 
the Democratic Party-National Salvation Front [PD-FSN], Messrs. 
Petre Roman and Adrian Severin expressed their worry over the 
possibility that Romania might not be among the countries that 
would be integrated into NATO first. Romania's integration into 
that body would both ensure national security and represent our 
country's acknowledgment as a part of the free world, the PD-FSN 
representatives said. 
  The vice chairman of the National Romanian Unity Party 
[PUNR], Mr. Ion Gavra, announced yesterday that his party had 
requested that the suggestions included in its anticrisis 
program should be implemented by the government within a 
so-called austerity program that is to be presented in 
parliament at the beginning of February. 
  A communique released yesterday by the Greater Romania Party 
[PRM] announces that they learned with deep concern about the 
decisions taken by the Satu Mare and Maramures County Councils 
on their adherence to the so-called Euro-Carpathian region, an 
artificial structure that endangers Romania's security and 
integrity. The PRM demands that the illegal decisions of the 
two chairmen of the aforementioned county councils should 
immediately be annulled.

  [Text] This morning the representatives of the main trade 
union confederations held a news conference, which was attended 
by Bogdan Hossu, chairman of Cartel Alfa, Miron Mitrea, the 
executive chairman of CNSLR [National Council of Romania's Free 
Trade Unions]-Fratia, and Marian Miclici, general secretary of 
the National trade Union Bloc [BNS]. During the news 
conference, Hossu announced that during yesterday's conference 
of the executive bodies of the three trade union confederations 
they agreed upon a program of action in the near future, as they 
all consider that the sole solution to the current economic and 
social problems is to go on a general strike. Therefore, on 28 
January, a one-hour warning general strike, on 4 February a 
one-day strike, and, beginning with 16 February, an open-ended 
general strike will begin, until all demands are met. Hossu 
added that he personally hopes that the labor conflict will be 
ended before 15 January. The precondition to this is that the 
government should also consider the demands forwarded by the 
trade unions, including the one requesting the establishment of 
a coalition government, in which case there will be no reasons 
to go on the planned strikes, which are actually not wanted by 
anyone, Hossu emphasized.

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Wagrowska: "A Long Run: Membership in </F>
NATO"] 
  [Text] It is anyone's guess how long we will have to wait 
for full membership in NATO and Western security guarantees. 
The Russian position is the main -- but to be sure not the only 
one -- reason why NATO flinches at the thought of admitting 
Central and East European states to the bloc. Another major 
reason is the organization's unwillingness or perhaps even 
inability for serious change. It seems that chances for the 
admission of Poland and other states from this region to NATO 
will not be realistic until these two problems are solved. For 
the time being, we must be happy with the "Partnership for 
Peace." 
  After President's Clinton declaration about the lack of 
agreement among NATO countries on the admission of "new 
democracies," it is highly unlikely that the situation can 
change with only a few hours left before the "16" summit. While 
any decision of the North Atlantic bloc can be approved by 
consensus, only four states -- Germany, the Netherlands, 
Belgium, and Norway -- accept the possibility of NATO's 
expansion. 
  Even if the bloc declares that Poland might become a NATO 
member in the future, this would be a nonbinding declaration. 
It will contain nothing that would allow Poland and other 
Central European states to count on NATO's helping hand in the 
event our security is jeopardized. 
  However, lack of "written" guarantees on the part of the 
only 
military and political organization in Europe should not be 
demonized. If the West thought that defending Poland was in its 
interests, it very well might extend us some kind of military 
support. Otherwise, Poland and other states of the region would 
have to have to expect the support -- rather hypothetically -- 
of the United Nations and CSCE. Several months ago, NATO 
spurned a Hungarian request for security guarantees -- prompted 
by the Balkan crisis -- saying that country could count on aid 
from the United Nations if its security were threatened. 
<H5>  Bad Russia </H5>
  According to a widely held belief, the main reason why NATO 
flinches at the thought of its expansion into Central and East 
Europe is the Russian position. Using an entire range of 
diplomatic and political means, Russia managed to force the West 
into respecting its interests and accepting its drive to 
influence the area west of its state borders. While the West 
says it denies Russia the right to veto NATO's expansion, at the 
same time it explains its reluctance to have new members by 
citing an unwillingness to create new divisions in Europe. 
  NATO gave Russia the time it needed to realize its 
significance. The West has probably committed a new sin with 
regard to that country by trusting that the Russian political 
establishment will change its perception of the Russian place in 
Europe and the world. After all, we all laughed at Andrey 
Kozyrev's "joke" at the CSCE conference in Stockholm last year, 
when he warned of expansionist policies if the Yeltsin team lost 
power in Russia. 
<H5>  In the Background </H5>
  Such Western policies have created the impression that 
Central Europe is being pushed to the background. European 
relations increasingly depend on the triangle connecting 
Washington, Bonn, and Moscow. Germany, which has been most 
vocal about the need to grant Poland and other countries 
admission into NATO, gives priority to relations with Moscow, 
and the United States proposes its "strategic partnership." 
This goes very well with Russia's efforts that Central European 
states be given security guarantees. According to this policy, 
our countries are left in a gray zone securing a kind of 
geopolitical balance in Europe. This would mainly apply to 
Poland as a country in a significant strategic location. 
  The West also seems to attach great importance to the 
"order-maintaining role" of Moscow in the CIS. This was proved 
at the CSCE conference in Rome which sanctioned Russian 
peacekeeping missions on territory of the former Soviet Union. 
The Russian Army can guarantee relative stability in that 
region and will always be able to head off any worst-case 
scenario. 
  Should the Russian position continue to influence U.S. and 
NATO policies so much, we can be waiting for NATO admission for 
a very long time. No one is sure how long it will take for 
Russian diplomacy to fully accept the sovereignty of countries 
which used to be its satellites. 
  NATO's relations with our country have little to do with the 
scenario that is currently developing in Moscow. No matter what 
happens -- whether the situation takes a dramatic turn (coup or 
Zhirinovskiy-style eruption of nationalism) or democracy 
prevails with Yeltsin agreeing to Poland's membership in NATO -- 
this would have little effect on Western policy concerning us. 
This raises the following question: Does the Russian 
reluctance to see Poland in NATO give the West a good excuse, a 
smokescreen? 
<H5>  Behind the Smokescreen </H5>
  The fact that the West participates in Moscow's game cannot 
be explained only by the fear of Russia or a reluctance to raise 
new barriers in Europe. NATO does not want any new members also 
because the expansion of a respected and wealthy group of 16 
states would change the organization itself. Organizationally 
and financially, it is not prepared for rebuilding its 
structure, deploying troops according to new principles, 
reforming systems of command, and allowing the East open access 
to modern military equipment. 
  Notably, at its Brussels summit, the bloc is not planning to 
alter the strategy it adopted at the end of 1991, despite 
numerous promises that it will adapt it to meet conditions in 
the changing world. The only new element will be a decision 
about creating the so-called combined operational forces which 
could engage in UN- or CSCE-sponsored actions (also in 
cooperation with the East). Also, experts prepared a 900-page 
report on NATO's participation in peaceful operations which, 
given the bloc's refusal to get directly involved in the 
Yugoslav conflict, will only be good for recycling. 
  In addition, France is increasingly perceived as moving 
closer to NATO structures. From now on, the French defense 
minister could participate in its meetings. No French minister 
has attended a NATO defense meeting since 1966, when France 
withdrew from the bloc's military structures. 
  NATO politicians and diplomats emphasize that the bloc's 
purpose should be to "organize" a security system. NATO could 
become the cornerstone of a common European system in the future 
which would consist of cooperation in the framework of NATO, the 
European Union, the CSCE, and the United Nations. However, this 
task might not be fulfilled either, if the North Atlantic bloc 
turns into an elite company, keeping "new democracies" outside. 
  "Partnership for Peace" 
  The concept of the "Partnership for Peace," as it is 
presented by its American authors, can be summed up in four 
basic points. 
  1. Becoming a NATO member is a process. 
  2. The "Partnership" is an initial step toward possible 
membership; at first, all of the 22 post-communist states and 
NATO's partners from the North Atlantic Cooperation Council will 
have equal chances. This, however, does not mean that some 
country will automatically gain NATO membership. 
  3. The "Partnership" will not be a substitute for the 
membership for states which have a chance of becoming NATO 
members. 
  4. Besides the above conditions, NATO will not define in the 
immediate future any specific conditions allowing, if met, 
candidates to count on membership or any timetable for admission. 
  According to the "Partnership for Peace," consultations with 
NATO are possible when some East European state feels that its 
security, territorial integrity, or independence are threatened. 
From the West's point of view, the following provisions are 
supposed to be very important: 
  1. Defense and budget planning; 
  2. Democratic (political, civilian) control over the 
military; 
  3. Cooperation in peace missions conducted under the 
auspices of the United Nations and CSCE; 
  4. Specification by each "partner" of troops which 
could participate in joint operations; 
  5. Joint training, exercises, and maneuvers; 
  6. Search and rescue missions; 
  7. Establishment of representation bureaus at NATO 
headquarters in Brussels and the military headquarters (SHAPE) 
[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe] in Mons; a teamwork 
of officers; 
  The "Partnership" program will also be open for neutral 
states which, in contrast to Central and East European 
countries, never belonged to the North Atlantic Cooperation 
Council.

<F P=106> [Report by Ewa Kaszuba and Krzysztof Olszewski: "A Unanimous </F>
Choir and A Solo Singer"] 
  [Text] Today's NATO summit, during which all the member 
states are supposed to issue their opinions on the possibility 
of admitting the states of Eastern and Central Europe to the 
organization, galvanized to action the diplomatic ranks of the 
states that are applying for membership. Formally, membership 
applications have been submitted only by Albania and Lithuania; 
the efforts of the Vysegrad Group, which are equally firm, have 
been confined to diplomacy. Poland's stand on this issue, which 
is today unequivocal and firm, gradually evolved. 
  At the beginning of the democratic transformations, when the 
Warsaw Pact was still in place, Poland's efforts focused mainly 
on the difficult negotiations of confirming the borders with the 
unifying Germany. Soon afterward, during his visit to the 
Federal Republic of Germany, President Lech Walesa proposed 
establishing an eastern NATO in our part of Europe. Also the 
defense minister in the Olszewski government made an unequivocal 
statement on Poland's need to ensure security by joining NATO. 
The Suchocka government considered this to be its strategic 
goal; the Waldemar Pawlak cabinet seems to continue this policy. 
  Last summer, when Boris Yeltsin assured Lech Walesa that 
<H5>  Russia Would Not Stop Poland </H5>
  from implementing this goal, it seemed that all we had to do 
was wait for an invitation from the other side. The situation, 
however, was aggravated by a change in Moscow's stance, 
especially by recent statements of Russian politicians. Their 
overtones awakened fears of a new Yalta. 
  Last week's interviews given by Lech Walesa to the Western 
press and television prove Poland's determination. In an 
interview for the Italian daily LA STAMPA, the president 
cautioned against the menace of a new confrontation between the 
East and the West in a cold-war style. "The East European 
states must be admitted to the West European Union and NATO; 
otherwise, Russia will seek to regain its influences in this 
region," he said. 
  In an interview for THE WASHINGTON POST, he criticized the 
American plan of "Partnership for Peace," saying that it is 
excellent, but after 50 years of communism it does not fit the 
present reality. He said that the West needs us, and not we 
need the West, and he added that it is a great mistake to leave 
a vacuum after overthrowing the communist system, because it may 
<H5>  Awaken Demons </H5>
  "We cannot speak about a partnership, because for the time 
being, there is no partnership to be seen; there is Russia, 
which is threatening; there is the West, which is scared; 
finally, in the middle there is us, who are saying: There is 
nothing to be afraid of; all that needs to be done is only 
increase physically and technically Eastern Europe's resources," 
stated the president in an interview for the American television 
network ITN, the German ARD, and the UPI Agency. In the latter 
interview the president informed that NATO and the West "are 
actually governed by Yeltsin." 
  The definite majority of the Polish political parties, 
despite earlier subtleties concerning Poland's integration with 
NATO, see this as a possibility for gaining security guarantees 
for Poland. This is a result of political developments in 
Russia as well as a lack of a clear response of the West. 
Politicians both of the left side and of the right side of the 
political scene fear the same: 
  "I can see two dangers: First, the reviving Russian 
nationalism; second, the lack of understanding in the West for 
the role of Poland in the system of European security," admits 
Romuald Szeremietiew, chairman of the Movement for the Republic 
[RdR]. 
  "We should be worried by the inability to predict what will 
happen behind our eastern border. It is still unclear 
<H5>  What Is Actually Going On There </H5>
  Also our Western partners do not have a full understanding 
for our affairs, as a result of which our situation is similar 
to being suspended in a vacuum, to some kind of a "gray zone," 
says Jerzy Szmajdzinski of the Democratic Left Alliance. In the 
election campaign the left was rather reserved in its opinions 
concerning integration with NATO. Today Szmajdzinski points to 
the necessity of changing the nature of this organization and 
Poland's need to seek security in a future system of European 
security; he also concedes that in the past four years Polish 
diplomacy has been expressing Polish state interests very well. 
He believes, however, that our relations with the East were 
neglected at that time, which is now bearing fruit. 
  Piotr Nowina-Konopka of the Democratic Union [UD] is afraid 
of chaos in the area of the former Soviet Union, which may 
ricochet and hit us. 
  "I am also alarmed by the crisis of European identity. The 
West simply does not have an idea as to how to organize the 
world after the Berlin wall collapsed." These words of the UD 
politician are also supported by Janusz Piechocinski of the 
Polish Peasant Party. He adds one more danger: 
<H5>  Economic Nationalism </H5>
  "For us the situation in the east will be relatively stable 
-- if Yeltsin remains president. If he were forced to step 
down, the advocates of an imperial policy would have a greater 
say. The center of Europe would not be a quiet place also if 
any authoritarian options were to be employed. Even though our 
goal is still membership in NATO, it is clear that they do not 
want us there in the present formula -- we are not a very 
attractive partner," adds Piechocinski. 
  Romuald Szeremietiew thought that our dowry and a strong 
argument for developing our relations with NATO and the West 
would be the fact of building the Vysegrad treaty, showing that 
the states that are part of it are taking care of their security 
themselves. The RdR leader says that it is bad that one state 
after another departs from this way of thinking; he calls this a 
silly matter. He thinks highly of recent efforts of the 
president and Minister Andrzej Olechowski. 
  "I am satisfied with the fact that everyone is unanimous in 
saying that we must join NATO. I wish that political forces of 
both the right and the left wing would be able to 
<H5>  Define the Canon of the Interests of the State </H5>
  of Poland. This should not be affected in any way by changes 
of governments or any political quarrels," he adds. 
  Only the Christian-Democratic Union [ZChN] is not in the 
unanimous choir of political parties; it claims that Poland 
should be a member of various kinds of European structures, but 
it must be done in line with the rules of partnership. 
  "We cannot be treated as a poor relative," says ZChN Deputy 
Chairman Ryszard Czarnecki. He says that the prospect of 
Poland's joining NATO is rather remote. "The evaluation of our 
participation in the organization depends on what roles we would 
be supposed to fulfill in it." 
  "The role of a sanitary cordon, or that of a bulwark, is not 
really what we want. Now, knocking on NATO's windows, which 
other parties are doing, is embarrassing and we will not take 
part in that," says Czarnecki.

  [Text] Warsaw, 7 Jan 1994 -- Today President Lech Walesa 
received Madame Ambassador Madeleine Albright, the permanent 
U.S. representative at the United Nations, and General John 
Shalikashvili, the chairman of the Chiefs of Staff of the U.S. 
Armed Forces, the Presidential Press Office reported in a 
communique. 
  Greeting the representatives of President Bill Clinton, 
President Walesa inter alia said: "We owe a lot to the United 
States, we lack the words to express our thanks. It so happens 
that the United States continues to have responsibility for the 
world. We are aware of this great responsibility and we wish to 
talk about this. We will do not wish to hinder these great 
ideas, but we would like to present our stand. 
  A new order is being created in Europe. There is an 
opportunity for a peaceful Europe. There is an opportunity for 
all the models that the United States advocates to be realized 
in their entirety on our continent. As a practical man I know 
that the opportunity that has arisen must be exploited. As a 
soldier I know that the best tactics are small leaps forward. 
It is possible to wriggle forward and sometimes appropriate, 
but observing different fields -- and as a corporal myself I 
trained some people -- I know that the tactic of jumping ahead 
and then crawling forward was always worthwhile. Today I feel 
that there is such an opportunity for a leap in Europe. Of 
course, it is possible to crawl forward, but I do not have to 
prove to soldiers how far slower it is, how far less effective. 
I invite everyone to take part in a discussion, so that we can 
present our arguments," states the communique.

  [Text] [Announcer] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the 
fascist-oriented Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, is -- 
according to GAZETA WYBORCZA -- to visit Poland in a few days' 
time. He has been invited by one of the activists of the 
Samoobrona National Front. 
  [Jacek Hugo-Bader, GAZETA WYBORCZA] The activist is a very 
rich man who has known Zhirinovskiy personally and who boasts 
about the fact that a few days before the elections in Russia he 
had congratulated Zhirinovskiy on his victory in these 
elections. I think that this man's motivation is to capitalize 
on Zhirinovskiy's name for publicity purposes in order to enable 
his grouping, which is new and unknown in Poland, to get into 
politics. 
  [Correspondent Monika Sieradzka] The author of the 
invitation, a rich entrepreneur, is convinced that Zhirinovskiy 
will win the future presidential elections in Russia. He wants 
to give him his financial support by, among other things, 
investing in Russia. 
  The invitation emphasizes that various things happened in 
the 
history of our nations but that this was the fault of 
politicians. In his opinion, the views of Zhirinovskiy and those 
of the Samoobrona National Front are convergent and the two 
parties should cooperate with each other. 
  [Hugo-Bader] The person who invited Zhirinovskiy said that 
he 
wants to arrange a meeting between Zhirinovskiy and any 
politician, so that they can talk to each other. 
  [Announcer] It is still not known whether Polish politicians 
will want to meet Zhirinovskiy. According to Lech Falandysz 
from the president's Chancellery, it is better to talk to 
Zhirinovskiy than to isolate him. It is better to let him into 
Poland than to refuse him entry into the country as the Germans, 
the French, and the Australians have done.

<F P=106> [Article by Piotr Jakucki: "The Whole Army in the </F>
President's Hands"] 
  [Text] According to a new constitutional law proposed by 
the Belvedere, President Lech Walesa would exercise full control 
over the Polish Army. 
  The draft, which consists of three typewritten pages, 
basically includes a passage saying that the "president 
exercises general command in the spheres of internal and 
external security of the state" (Article 34). It provides for 
the establishment of a new National Security Council, RBN, whose 
composition and principle activities would be determined by the 
president (Article 37a, Item 5). The RBN would be "an 
institution in charge of the state's internal and external 
security, making decisions on all matters that the Constitution 
or other law did not delegate to the president's competence or 
that of other state institutions, or local governments." 
  According to the proposed law, the RBN would decide about: 
  "1. General principles of internal and external security of 
the state, including those concerning the defense of the Polish 
Republic. 
  ``2. Basic organizational principles of the Armed Forces and 
their size, as well as those of civil defense and paramilitary 
units and other elements of the state's defense system. 
  ``3. Measures intended to heighten combat readiness; it 
could also come up with proposals to introduce a state of 
emergency or martial law, and order a mobilization or declare 
war." 
  The RBN would also be responsible for controlling and 
supervising the implementation of objectives in the sphere of 
the general duty of protection. 
  According to the Belvedere's proposals, the RBN's decisions 
would be "binding for institutions and organizational units to 
which they were dispatched."

<F P=106> [Report by Robert Krasowski: "New Constitution This Year?"] </F>
  [Text] The deputies' clubs, president, and government have 
until 9 May to submit their constitution drafts. Not a single 
draft has reached the Sejm yet. However, two proposals 
concerning the method of work of the new constitution have been 
drafted, one by the KPN [Confederation for an Independent 
Poland] and one by the Union of Labor. 
  The Union of Labor suggests referendums in which society 
would vote on specific constitutional issues, whereas the KPN 
wants the Constitutional Committee to resume the work it carried 
out under the previous government and consider the 
constitutional drafts that were submitted then. The KPN argues 
that in this way, those parties that failed to win parliamentary 
seats this time around will have a chance of taking part in the 
work on the new constitution, and will enable it to be adopted 
sooner. 
  But the Constitutional Committee, led by Aleksander 
Kwasniewski, prefers the so-called zero option, in other words 
making a brand new start on the constitution and declaring all 
the constitutional drafts submitted under the previous 
government as null and void. The Sejm is to decide whether the 
committee will consider the six draft constitutions that have 
been produced by the Democratic Union, SLD [Democratic Left 
Alliance], Central Accord, KPN, Senate, and jointly by the 
Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and Union of Labor. 
  Even if the Sejm does accept the zero option, that does not 
mean that work on the new basic law will not begin until six 
months' time. Sejm speaker Jozef Oleksy has urged the 
Constitutional Committee to produce its own draft constitution 
in an effort to speed up the adoption of the new basic law, work 
on which has dragged on for four years already. 
  In Moczulski's opinion, the SLD's Kwasniewski, who harbors 
presidential ambitions, may cause the new constitution to be 
adopted in the middle of 1994 so that he can call a premature 
presidential election in the autumn. Such a scenario is 
possible because if the SLD and PSL were to produce their own 
draft, their parliamentary majority would bring about the 
acceptance of this draft and the defeat of all the others. But 
there are two major obstacles to this -- the increasing 
political differences between the PSL and SLD, and the stance of 
President Walesa. 
  Before the elections, the PSL and SLD came out strongly in 
favor of a parliamentary system, leaving the president with the 
mere role of arbiter. But these days, Kwasniewski is making it 
clear that the SLD is prepared to expand the president's powers 
considerably. If the PSL fails to agree to this, the SLD, in 
its bid for a strong presidency, may count only on Walesa's 
Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms, and perhaps the KPN. 
  In turn, if the SLD does accelerate work on the constitution 
with the intention of bringing about an earlier presidential 
election, Walesa will object most strongly. The president said 
recently that he will not allow an earlier presidential 
election, and made it clear that if the ruling coalition tries 
to make him resign over the constitution, he will call an 
earlier parliamentary election. 
  Since becoming chairman of the Constitutional Committee, 
Kwasniewski has said that he has no intention of curtailing 
Walesa's presidential term, of which there is still two years 
left.

  For the representatives of the U.S. President, the way 
Hungary reacts to the initiative is of great significance prior 
to the Brussels NATO summit. This is what Janos Herman, 
spokesman for foreign affairs, had to say about this after the 
discussions: 
  [Begin Herman recording] Prime Minister Peter Boross said 
that Hungary welcomes this initiative; Hungary is ready to take 
part in the Partnership for Peace process. At the same time, he 
also stressed that according to Hungarian opinion this is a 
step, it is a form of cooperation, it is a question of a process 
that, when the time is right [megfeleloe idoeben], when all the 
circumstances are assured, will lead to Hungary's NATO 
membership. [end recording]

  [Text] [Announcer] The two special envoys of the U.S. 
President are currently holding talks with Prime Minister Peter 
Boross. Prior to that, the U.S. ambassador to the UN [Albright] 
and the U.S. chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
[Shalikashvili] had talks with Defense Minister Lajos Fur and 
Head of State Arpad Goncz. Jozsef Barat reports on the latter 
meeting. 
  [Barat] The Partnership for Peace program is a serious step 
towards political integration rather than being just an ersatz 
[potcselekves], Arpad Gocz said during talks with Ambassador 
Albright and General John Shalikashvili. The terms of the 
complex political and military cooperation program are mutually 
acceptable, the president of the Republic stressed, and he 
called it important that the U.S. initiative treated the region 
as a whole. According to Arpad Goncz, it is also shown by the 
fact that Prague was chosen for the venue of next week's 
meeting. The president agreed that the Partnership for Peace 
program was of extensive and not exclusive character, that is it 
will do no damage, it will not harm sensitive areas in fostering 
ties with the East. 
  President Clinton's special envoys assured Arpad Goncz that 
the security of the United States and that of Central Europe 
were interrelated. For Washington, the security of all 
countries in the region is equally important.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Hungarian-U.S. talks are underway in 
Budapest on the overseas proposal that NATO should, for the time 
being, only extend its cooperation with the East European 
countries instead of full membership. [passage ommitted] 
  The U.S. President sent two special emissaries to Budapest 
to 
learn about the Hungarian stance on Washington's notion. UN 
Ambassador Albright and General Shalikashvili, U.S. chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, first held talks with Minister of 
Defense Lajos Fur. After the meeting Lajos Fur spoke of concrete 
forms of cooperation: 
  [Begin Fur recording] The countries which declare that they 
will accept the system of Partnership for Peace can send 
representatives to NATO headquarters in Brussels. Every country 
will have to decide for themselves whether they take this upon 
themselves, and how much of this they will take on. The 
countries concerned will have to issue a declaration of intent, 
in which they will have to state how much and at what rate they 
wish to take upon themselves the building of relations. To 
continue, representatives can be sent to NATO headquarters in 
Brussels, the same applies to the NATO command, the chiefs, 
where one or two military experts can be sent. 
  Three important fields of concrete military cooperation were 
mentioned: military planning, military training, and the 
organization of joint exercises. [end recording]

  [Text] The international news conference by Madeleine 
Albright and Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky ended a 
few minutes ago. Our correspondent Istvan Szelloe reports: 
  [Szelloe] It is no longer a question for Hungary whether we 
will enter NATO, the only question is when, Foreign Minister 
Geza Jeszenszky stressed. Hungary welcomes the Partnership for 
Peace cooperation, and we are of the view that it promotes 
joining the Euro-Atlantic security system. Our foreign minister 
added that relations between our country and NATO had been good 
up to date. The fact that Hungary opened its airspace for AWACS 
planes also proves it. 
  Madeleine Albright, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, 
conveyed a message from President Clinton, according to which 
Hungary's security is very important for the United States and 
the Partnership for Peace cooperation can lay the foundation of 
security. However, as John Shalikashvili pointed out, it does 
not automatically mean [security]. It is NATO membership that 
can give full security. 
  Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky added: There is virtually 
no 
difference of view in the most important issues between the 
Visegrad countries.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Baba, deputy state secretary for </F>
foreign affairs, by unidentified announcer in the studio -- live] 
  [Text] [Announcer] The weekend was quite tense in Slovakia. 
Some of the Slovak press in Pozsony [Bratislava] wrote that the 
Hungarians are expected to declare autonomy, that they want to 
secede, and thus, so to speak, created tension. It seems that a 
very moderate viewpoint came out at the meeting of Hungarian 
mayors in Rev-Komarom [Komarno]. In your view, to what extent 
can this have a positive effect on Hungarian-Slovak relations in 
the coming months? 
  [Baba] First of all, I wish to stress that the Rev-Komarom 
meeting was a warning meeting of the Hungarians of Slovakia, the 
Hungarian political forces of Slovakia. Its aim was to call the 
attention of the Slovak Government and political circles to the 
fact that Slovakia has not done what it undertook to do when it 
was accepted into the Council of Europe. 
  I believe that this warning was successful, and certain 
political and press circles did indeed create tension 
artificially, since the political parties of the Hungarians of 
Slovakia have so far phrased their views and ideas, which are 
fundamentally important for the existence and future of the 
Hungarians of Slovakia, quite clearly, and I presume they will 
continue to do so. 
  For example, education. Everyone speaks of the use of 
[Hungarian] names, but this is not the only issue; the issues 
are a proper school system, and the dangers of the 
reorganization of the administration. This was expressed in 
Rev-Komarom very moderately, and in a very acceptable tone. I 
hope that the Slovak Government and the moderate Slovak 
political circles will receive it that way, too. 
  [Announcer] Thank you, Deputy State Secretary Ivan Baba, for 
coming to the studio.

  [Text] Early this afternoon the Association of Towns and 
Villages of Zitny Ostrov held a final session before the 
assembly in Komarno tomorrow, 8 January. 
  At the meeting practically the last details were discussed. 
In addition to a discussion of security issues, a decision was 
made that tomorrow in Komarno the so-called 100-strong 
parliament, which was to be the highest representative body of 
Hungarians in Slovakia, will not be established after all. They 
will not establish it because the Slovak Interior Ministry will 
not permit the registration of this organization. 
  The demands formulated in Komarno will nonetheless be 
submitted to the Slovak legislative through the 14 National 
Council ethnic Hungarian deputies. 
  The organizers sent out 5,000 invitations to the assembly, 
and according to preliminary estimates at least 1,500 
participants were expected. Representatives of foreign 
diplomatic services in Bratislava and the heads of several 
international bodies were among those invited. 
  On the other hand, Catherine Lalumiere, secretary general of 
the Council of Europe, has canceled her visit.

  [Kiss] A request for the registration of Torgyan's party has 
been refused, Torgyan himself said at a news briefing. The party 
was formed in order for the electors to clearly see who they are 
voting for in the elections. Just like the Independent 
Smallholders' Party, other parties would also like to get into 
parliament. There would have been only one Torgyan party but, 
following the refusal, it is clear that the Independent 
Smallholders' Party [FKGP] can launch the fight on its own and 
it will not establish an alliance with anybody before the first 
round of the elections, Jozsef Torgyan said. 
  He then talked about the party's foreign political strategy. 
The green light must be given to Asian and Pacific capital, 
because companies from Hong Kong and Taiwan would invest 
billions of dollars in Hungary. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In an interview with a Khorizont Radio Network 
representative, President Dr. Zhelyu Zhelev expressed sharp 
disagreement with reports published in the 7 January 1994 issues 
of certain Bulgarian dailies regarding the functions and 
prerogatives of the president's military cabinet. 
  Dr. Zhelev described such materials as insinuations and as 
biased reports written at the the instruction of certain 
political forces. The president's spokesman, Valentin Stoyanov, 
is expected to make a statement on the subject of the military 
cabinet and its functions on Bulgarian National Radio and 
National Television later in the day. 
  Dr. Zhelev also commented on the recent meeting between 
representatives of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] and the 
Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] at the SDS headquarters, 134 
Rakovski Street. The president described the meeting as the 
result of an acute internal crisis affecting both coalitions 
that evokes fear of democratic ideas. 
  Mr. Zhelev opposes the idea that parliament should appoint a 
caretaker government and that it should work during the period 
of preparation for the next elections.

<F P=106> [Statement by Valentin Stoyanov, President Zhelev's </F>
spokesman -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Valentin Stoyanov, the president's 
spokesman, expressed his view on today's reports published by 
some newspapers and related to the functions and prerogatives of 
the president's military cabinet: 
  [Begin Stoyanov recording] Today a few Sofia dailies gave in 
to the manipulations of certain political centers and groups 
that are pursuing the goal of slandering the president of the 
Republic of Bulgaria. 
  Referring to a letter the president wrote on 22 November 
1993 
to the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff of the 
Bulgarian Army, some anonymous politicians and commentators are 
trying to insinuate that the president's military cabinet is 
either duplicating or substituting for the functions and 
prerogatives of the General Staff and the Ministry of Defense. 
Those gentlemen have evidently interpreted the letter in a 
totally biased way, like the devil reading the Bible, because at 
the very beginning of the letter it is stated as follows, and I 
quote: 
  The president's military cabinet as a whole, its chief, and 
the advisers on the different branches of service, have neither 
command nor control functions over the Ministry of Defense and 
the Bulgarian Army. It could not be stated more clearly than 
that. 
  We should add that the text was approved by the Ministry of 
Defense and by the chief of the General Staff and circulated 
among all military units in the form of a special letter. 
  Even more preposterous are the allegations that the 
president, by issuing Decree No. 269, intended to take over 
direct command of the Army. We should first carefully read the 
Constitution in order to understand the nature of the 
president's decrees, and then to realize that the decree in 
question is by no means secret and that whoever is interested in 
it can read it. 
  I am talking about a document that determines the duties of 
the military cabinet within the framework of the presidential 
institution. 
  Item 1 of the decree in question reads as follows, and I 
quote: 
  The military cabinet assists the president of the Republic 
of 
Bulgaria in exercising his functions as supreme commander in 
chief, by collecting, analyzing, and summing up informative 
data. The military cabinet has no leading or control functions 
whatsoever over the Armed Forces as a whole, or over any of 
their branches. 
  We feel obliged to confirm our impression that any step 
adopted by the president in connection with settling mutual 
relations among the country's public institutions is treated 
with extreme hostility by certain political parties or civil 
servants. 
  The present attack is only part of a more extensive campaign 
aimed at discrediting the head of state. 
  Nevertheless, everyone should realize that if the president 
of the Republic of Bulgaria would have transgressed his 
prerogatives in any sphere whatsoever, if he had committed any 
act whatsoever in violating the Constitution, the authors of 
today's scenarios would have seriously demanded his resignation, 
as stipulated by the Constitution, rather than engaging in 
devious political machinations as they are doing today. 
  One of the goals of the current campaign is to introduce a 
split between the president, as commander in chief, and the 
Bulgarian Army. This is an attempt of undermining the 
foundations of the country's national security. Those who 
consider themselves good Bulgarian politicians could win public 
confidence by engaging in useful patriotic activities, rather 
than in futile plots and machinations, because all attempts at 
slandering other people are usually counterproductive. 
  It is high time to introduce a more civilized spirit into 
Bulgarian political life, because slanders and attempts at 
discrediting one's fellow citizens are placing Bulgaria in an 
awkward situation in the eyes of our own people and are making 
our country appear ridiculous in the eyes of the world. 
  The political plotters could engage in some more serious 
tasks serving Bulgaria's interests. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Statement of the All-National Committee for the Defense of </F>
National Interests, on its fourth anniversary, read by 
unidentified speaker -- live] 
  [Text] Dear compatriots, in these dramatic days of global 
social changes, when the erosion of the Bulgarian spirit is part 
of our difficult everyday life, a symbol of patriotism and 
national pride is more than ever necessary. The anniversary of 
our existence marked by indefatigable efforts for the homeland's 
sake is both an opportunity and an obligation to assess our work. 
  The All-National Committee for the Defense of National 
Interests is celebrating its fourth anniversary. This is a very 
young age for the dimensions of history, but it is sufficient to 
give evidence of political wisdom, of a new self-confidence, and 
of meaningful efforts. 
  Founded at a grandiose mass rally on 7 January 1990, which 
took place in front of the St. Aleksandur Nevski Cathedral [in 
the Sofia center], a rally which was prompted by the spontaneous 
wave of people's discontent in facing the emerging Turkish 
danger, the All-National Committee for the Defense of National 
Interests is the most extensive public organization in our 
country today. 
  The committee, precisely, is the reliable and unshakable 
guard watching over our national sovereignty, confronted with 
the dark shadow of the Pan-Islamic doctrine, which permitted the 
emergence of ethnic unrest and provocations. The committee has 
become a shield protecting the revival of the Bulgarian spirit. 
  We are now addressing you, our compatriots. We appeal to 
your faith and patriotism, in the hope that, all together, we 
shall jointly revive Bulgaria as a strong, prospering, and 
democratic country. 
  The All-National Committee for the Defense of National 
Interests guarantees that not even an inch of the Bulgarian soil 
shall be taken away, that no Bulgarian shall be Turkicized or 
turned into a Macedonian [makedoniziran]. In professing the 
truth that every citizen is equal before the law, we are 
following the postulates of our apostle of freedom, Vasil 
Levski, in repeating his everlasting principle: Life in our 
Bulgarian homeland should not be similar to life in a Turkish 
village. 
  We are convinced that all our compatriots, wherever they are 
throughout the world, are equal citizens of our homeland and 
children of mother Bulgaria. We shall always defend the rights 
of Bulgarians in Macedonia, Ukraine, Moldova, Yugoslavia, 
Romania, Albania, Turkey, Greece, the Commonwealth of 
Independent States, in Europe, and all over the world. 
  We resolutely condemn national nihilism and we shall 
severely 
hold responsible all traitors. We categorically declare that 
there is no place for the Rights and Freedoms Movement [DPS] in 
a future parliament, nor is there place for any party whatsoever 
based on ethnic or religious principles. 
  We are against the genocide through which some kind of 
religious pseudo-movement and single-racial formations are 
dividing the Bulgarian nation and are creating contemporary 
ghettos for their supporters. 
  We declare ourselves in support of the civil disobedience 
and 
intellectual rebellion of the materially destitute and 
humiliated Bulgarian scientists, teachers, educators, 
physicians, engineers, economists, workers, peasants, and 
pensioners. We are in favor of a priority statute for our 
national capital. 
  We are siding with the Bulgarian youths who are the victims 
of irresponsible experiments, dooming them to unemployment and 
hopelessness. We are rejecting the anti-Bulgarian approach to 
the young generation. Bulgaria belongs to you, young friends, 
do not leave it to others. It shall be the country which we all 
are going to create. 
  We are also addressing our Bulgarian women with hopeful 
confidence. Mothers of the homeland, let us protect together 
the national ideals and interests, the lives, efforts, and 
future prosperity of your children. We are in favor of social 
protection and support the nation's biological survival. We are 
against the slandering and disgracing of those who created 
Bulgaria in ancient times and in our contemporary history. 
  We are watching the developments in the Rhodope area with 
concern. Let us raise our voice of warning against all 
unpatriotic elements. Bulgarian Muslims are Bulgarians just 
like all of us, like all Eastern Orthodox, Catholics, 
Protestants, and atheists in Bulgaria. 
  We shall never permit the poison of Macedonianism to corrupt 
the souls of Bulgarians in the Pirin area and in Vardar 
Macedonia. It is justified to fight the relapses into 
Macedonianism with fire and sword. 
  No Macedonian nation or language whatsoever exist. Our 
brothers in the Vardar area must be granted the right of free, 
ethnic, self-identification. 
  We appeal for the integration with the peoples belonging to 
Christian civilization, for integration with the ancient values 
of Europe, an insuperable part of which we have always been. 
  Once more we would like to recall our feelings of sympathy 
and friendship with Russia. This glorious Slavonic country was 
a great positive factor for the birth of the Third Bulgarian 
State. Today, when Russia is going through difficulties and 
privations, despite all things, we are convinced that its 
historical existence shall always be a factor of peace and 
stability in the world, in Europe, and the Balkans. 
  We respect and appreciate the remarkable democratic values 
created by the brilliant minds of numerous U.S. citizens. We 
shall always remember the words of Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin 
Franklin, the great founders of the United States, that freedom 
is the greatest benefit of mankind. We are proud that hundreds 
of thousands of Bulgarians have participated in the building of 
the economically most powerful state in the world, as its equal 
citizens, and that one of them even invented the computer. 
  We would like to strengthen the traditional cooperation and 
the spirit of understanding with Germany. Our joint victories 
and defeats have taught us that nothing is more valuable than a 
hand of assistance offered in hard times. 
  Dear compatriots, four years ago, the All-National Committee 
lit the spark of Bulgarian patriotism and nationalism. Today 
the spark is growing into a flame. Tomorrow it shall light the 
fire of purification and rebirth. The only principle worth 
announcing shall be: Bulgaria above everything.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Atanas Matev: "Own Choice"] </F>
  [Text] According to a promise made by Theodhoros Pangalos, 
Greece's alternate minister of foreign affairs responsible for 
European issues, Greece will not exploit its six-month 
presidency of the European Union to further its foreign policy 
aims. 
  This sounds all very fine, but the other EU countries do not 
accept his words on faith, but will judge the Greek presidency 
by its actions. For one cannot assume from the outset that 
Athens will not succumb to the temptation of promoting its own 
interests in its relations with Bulgaria, relying on the 
authority and opportunities offered by its term of leadership of 
the European Union that has just begun. 
  The EU presidency provides great opportunities to the 
country 
exercising its functions. One such opportunity -- and a very 
important one -- is that the country in question determines the 
agendas of the various EU bodies, and can speed up or slow down 
the consideration of important problems. 
  For Bulgaria, this is of great importance. For a number of 
reasons, a slowdown occurred in Bulgaria's relations with the 
European Union, which it is now necessary to make good. Greece 
is able to help or hinder this process. 
  Athens is perfectly well aware of this. It also knows that 
certain profound differences exist in Bulgarian-Greek relations 
regarding Balkan problems, such as the Macedonian question. 
  It is up to Greece to decide whether or not it wants 
Bulgaria's relations with the European Union to expand. 
  It is also up to Bulgaria to decide how to respond to any 
particular situation, and its response should be an honorable 
one.

Confederation, which was attended by representatives of the

the country. 
  The participants adopted a draft decision, which notes that 
a 
strike situation exists in the country. The General Assembly 
proposes to the Podkrepa Executive and Federative Councils to 
complete the preparations for national strike activities by 1 
February. Those activities will be aimed, I quote, against the 
antihuman and antisocial policy of Professor Berov's government. 
  The draft decision will be submitted to the Podkrepa 
Federative Council, which is scheduled to meet on 16-17 January 
in Blagoevgrad.

  [Text] Madeleine Albright, U.S. ambassador to the United 
Nations, and John Shalikashvili, chairman of the U.S. Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, arrived in Prague today. Our special 
correspondent Miroslav Konvalina was at the airport. He managed 
brief interviews with them: 
  [Begin recording] [Konvalina] Shortly after 1700, a Boeing 
landed at Ruzyne airport after a flight from Bratislava, 
carrying members of the U.S. Government team responsible for the 
preparation of the coming visit by Bill Clinton to Prague. The 
delegation, which previously had talks in Poland, Hungary, and 
the Slovak Republic, is headed by Madeleine Albright, special 
envoy of the United States for the preparation of the coming 
NATO summit in Brussels, and John Shalikashvili, chairman of the 
U.S. Armed Forces Joint Chiefs of Staff. They were met by Adrian 
Basora, U.S. ambassador to the Czech republic, Alexandr Vondra, 
Czech first deputy foreign minister, and Michael Zantovsky, 
Czech ambassador to the United States. 
  Ambassador Albright then answered only two questions, both 
for Czech Radio. First she said she was expecting from the 
Prague visit agreement on what is necessary for a good summit in 
Brussels and then she said, answering the second question, that 
she did not anticipatate any open questions between the Czech 
Republic and the United States. 
  Before his departure from the airport, General John 
Shalikashvili replied to a question by Czech Radio as to what he 
was expecting from tomorrow's meeting. He said: I look forward 
to it and I expect a lot from it. 
  I asked the general if there were still open questions 
between the Visegrad countries and NATO concerning the 
"Partnership for Peace" initiative. Gen. Shalikashvili replied: 
I am coming with three tasks. First, we want to assure our 
colleagues in Prague that the United States is interested in the 
security of the Czech Republic and its stability. Further, we 
want to hear the views of the hosts and their apprehensions. 
Third, we want to reply to all questions concerning the 
Partership for Peace initiative, which will be discussed at the 
coming summit in Brussels tomorrow. 
  Madeleine Albright and John Shalikashvili have a private 
program tonight. Tomorrow they will meet the Czech prime 
minister, the defense minister, and the foreign minister and 
will leave for Brussels in the afternoon to attend the NATO 
summit, where Madeleine Albright will play a lead role in the 
U.S. presidential delegation. On Tuesday, the two U.S. guests 
will again return to Prague, accompanied by Bill Clinton.

United States to the United Nations, and General John 
Shalikashvili, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
visited the Czech Parliament today. More information from Ilona 
Dienstbierova. 
  [Dienstbierova] Shortly after 0900, the U.S. guests were 
received by Jiri Payne and Vladimir Suman, chairmen of the 
parliament Foreign Affairs and Defense and Security Committees. 
The U.S. Government member and Madeleine Albright stated at the 
very beginning the aim of this mission. Together with Gen. John 
Shalikashvili, they want to listen to our questions, to get to 
know the views of the Czech representatives, and to discuss 
them. The United States wants us to know that the security of 
the Central European region is of direct interest, not only of 
U.S. interest but also of the alliance's. 
  The security of the Czech Republic and of the whole area of 
countries between Russia and the West will directly influence 
U.S. security, Albright went on to say. There should be no doubt 
about U.S. interests in Europe as a whole. The U.S. ambassadress 
to the United Nations recalled that President Clinton committed 
himself to keeping U.S. forces in Europe. 
  As far as the Partnership for Peace is concerned, Albright 
thinks that the U.S. President understands this plan as an 
important initiative. She went on to say that there were 
evolutionary and dynamic aspects to this plan. It is a concept 
that would enable every country to pick up the ball and run with 
it. Partnership for Peace is a pledged responsibility and also 
represents shared values, Albright stated in the Czech 
Parliament a few minutes ago. At this moment, the closed meeting 
with Gen. Shalikashvili is also coming to an end.

  [Text] In connection with the coming visit of U.S. 
President Bill Clinton to Prague, President of the Republic 
Vaclav Havel granted an interview today to Czech Television: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified interviewer] What program 
and 
what aims will you have at these historical talks? 
  [Havel] The Czech Republic naturally has its views not only 
on the "Partnership for Peace" plan, not only on the future of 
the North Atlantic Alliance, its identity, its position, and its 
meaning, but also on the overall security situation in Europe. 
Naturally, we would like to convey this view to the U.S. side. 
We would be glad if there were a dialogue; we should not just be 
told things. 
  [Interviewer] No one in the West denies that NATO is going 
through an identity crisis. How do you think NATO should solve 
this crisis and, together with it, the question of security in 
Europe? 
  [Havel] NATO has realized that, in the new situation of the 
end of the Cold War, its doctrine, its meaning, its position, 
and its role in Europe have to change, and it has been working 
on it. 
  It may appear from our viewpoint that it has been working on 
it far too slowly, that the situation would require greater 
courage, greater magnanimity, a faster rate. But I think it 
cannot be disputed that this alliance, as the strongest and the 
only functioning one, should be a kind of a stabilizing core of 
all European security. There are differences in the ideas as to 
what technique to use, what speed and so on. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Czech President Vaclav Havel by Vaclav </F>
Pavrovsky at Lany presidential residence; date not given; from 
the "Conversations at Lany" program--live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Pavrovsky] The most important 
event at the present time is undoubtedly President Clinton's 
visit to Prague. It seems that its focal point lies in the 
preparation for the incorporation into NATO of the Czech 
Republic, and also of other postcommunist states. After all, 
this is confirmed by the visit of Madeleine Albright and General 
John Shalikashvili. They are coming with the "Partnership for 
Peace" plan. Or am I mistaken? Are there other important matters 
related to this visit? 
  [Havel] I consider it a privilege for our republic that 
President Clinton will stop here during his important European 
tour and that it is here that he will be meeting representatives 
of neighboring countries. I myself consider this to be an 
expression of respect for the successes of the Czech Republic, 
an expression of recognition of the traditionally good 
U.S.-Czech relations. 
  The main, although certainly not the only, subject of our 
talks will probably be our position in the newly shaping 
European order, which will relate not only to security. 
  President Clinton will arrive from Brussels, where the NATO 
summit is taking place, and he will probably interpret the 
"Partnership for Peace" plan to us. We will expound our attitude 
toward it. 
  At the same time, however, there are more things at stake 
here. What this is really about is where we belong and what 
values of civilization we acknowledge. I am sure that there will 
be an opportunity to raise this because I know that President 
Clinton is a man capable of listening to others. I myself was 
surprised when I visited him in Washington to find how little he 
talked himself and how much he asked. He is a man who is curious 
about the other person's opinion, who is open to knowledge, who 
wants to be informed, and I think these are also the 
prerequisites for our being able to express our views. 
  [Pavrovsky] Mr. President, you have undoubtedly very good 
memories of President Bush, President Clinton's predecessor. If 
you were to recall all this and if you were to comment on the 
differences between these two administrations or in U.S. policy, 
what would you say? It is in effect a change of party in the 
U.S. Government. 
  [Havel] [passage omitted] My personal relationship with 
President Bush was excellent, and my cooperation with the 
Republican administration was good. We certainly have not 
forgotten what the previous administration did to boost our good 
relations. It was at the time when we got rid of communism, and 
the United States treated us in a very accommodating manner. 
  The situation has changed, however. There is a new 
administration, and we shall naturally be seeking good relations 
with this administration. In the spiritual ethos of a Democratic 
administration, there is something that is close to my heart. I 
mentioned this on more than one occasion in our previous 
conversations. I hope that this will have a favorable impact on 
the serious political negotiations we shall have. 
  [Pavrovsky] Slovakia and other postcommunist countries 
think that they should enter NATO or make joint moves leading to 
their entering NATO. Defense Minister Antonin Baudys said on 
behalf of the Czech Republic that this should happen on an 
individual basis. 
  [Havel] Czech policy lays correct emphasis on the fact that 
we are independent countries that have to act on their own and 
that have to follow their own interests. We cannot forever be 
tarred with the same brush of being postcommunist countries, or 
former Warsaw Pact members, and so on and so forth. 
  However, that does not at all mean that we should not 
maintain the best possible relations with our immediate 
neighbors. I believe we will have an opportunity to emphasize on 
behalf of the Czech Republic that our position does not at all 
mean that we do not want to cooperate on all levels where it is 
advantageous for all the participants, or that we wish to 
elevate ourselves above others. We shall be able to emphasize 
that we are independent states. The world will have to get used 
to this fact and will have to shed the tendency to tar certain 
countries with the same brush and make life easier by 
inadvertently pushing them into forming a bloc because it is 
quicker to negotiate with a bloc than separately with each of 
the countries. 
  [Pavrovsky] Attempts by postcommunist countries to join NATO 
are very strongly opposed by the Russian leadership. Mr. 
President, what do you think about Mr. Zhirinovskiy's actions 
and behavior? 
  [Havel] To be honest, I am not very much interested in Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy's rather wild pronouncements. What I am interested 
in is to what extent he voices openly and harshly something that 
has lain dormant in the consciousness of Russian society and 
whether others do not express such cruel harshness just because 
it is inappropriate to do so. That is a matter that would be 
worth exploring, rather than exploring Mr. Zhirinovskiy as a 
phenomenon. [passage omitted] 
  [Pavrovsky] Mrs. Rita Klimova, the first envoy of our state 
to the United States, has died. I know you were friends. 
  [Havel] I ought to say that her death was quite painful for 
me. I held her in high esteem as a very frank, courageous, and 
wise woman. She was a splendid ambassador of our country to the 
United States and did a great deal for our republic. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Viktor </F>
Krejci; place and date not given: "The Regular DENNI TELEGRAF 
Interview With Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Krejci] Is it true that the 
Czech side wanted to meet with U.S. President Clinton 
individually but the U.S. side and the other countries of the 
Visegrad Group did not like the idea? 
  [Klaus] When the news first appeared that President Clinton 
would be visiting Prague after the Brussels NATO summit ends, no 
one doubted--and the opposite did not even cross anyone's 
mind--that he would use the visit to Prague to meet with the 
representatives of the governments of all four countries of 
Central and Eastern Europe--that is, the Czech Republic, Poland, 
Hungary, and the Slovak Republic. It was never even considered 
that we would be the only ones to talk with him. On the other 
hand, collective talks have not been considered, either. His 
stopover is simply used for a parallel meeting with four 
delegations. 
  [Krejci] What will be, for the Czech side, the main topic of 
this meeting? 
  [Klaus] The meeting with President Clinton is certainly the 
most important point for us because it is a very important 
signal for the entire world that President Clinton has chosen 
Prague in particular for this meeting between the NATO summit 
and his visit to Moscow. The official talks will be relatively 
brief and the matter of external security will be of greater 
importance because the visit will follow the NATO session.

  [Text] Defense Minister Antonin Baudys today rejected 
speculation that the Czech Republic is setting itself apart from 
the Visegrad Group. With regard to his canceled trip to Warsaw, 
Baudys said that his deputy, Jiri Pospisil, is well qualified to 
fully cover for him. 
  According to Minister Baudys, the envisaged visit by 
President Bill Clinton is an exceptional event. However, the 
minister noted that the Army is not preparing any extraordinary 
measures or alert. The only measure is that the military police 
will cooperate with the municipal police, the Interior Ministry, 
and other bodies, in order to protect public order.

  [Text] We had to explain to our partners in Warsaw that the 
Czech Republic intends to join NATO as soon as possible. It does 
not really matter whether this happens jointly or on an 
individual basis. This is what Czech Deputy Defense Minister 
Jiri Pospisil said shortly after his arrival by air from Warsaw. 
  He also explained to the Visegrad defense ministers in the 
Polish capital that our side regards the "Partnership for Peace" 
plan as the maximum of what NATO is able to grant to us at the 
present time. It is also regarded as a minimum designed to 
ensure that security requirements are met. 
  The sides that attended the Warsaw meeting expressed their 
unequivocal consent with Partnership for Peace. However, Deputy 
Minister Pospisil admitted that there are differences as regards 
the considerations regarding the possible coordination of a 
joint approach to NATO. While Poland and Slovakia favor this 
option, Hungary's stance appears to be closer to the Czech 
stance. 
  Polish President Walesa, who met the ministers, pointed out 
that, first and foremost, it should be the Czech Republic that 
should make use of the historical opportunity of joining NATO. 
If it does not do so, Poland will reportedly look for new 
partners. But I do not know which countries he meant, Jiri 
Pospisil said.

<F P=106> [Article by Pavel Novotny: "RDP Group: `The Aim of Our </F>
Activity Is Coordination'"] 
  [Text] Prague--The RDP Group, the shareholding company 
comprising arms, engineering, and metallurgical plants, has the 
task of coordinating among its members a course of action for 
developing and implementing new products. Its capital of 40 
million korunas, otherwise quite negligible in this field, 
merely supports the company's relevant activity, said RDP Press 
Spokesman Jiri Vich in an interview with us. 
  The RDP Group does not have an actual plan of activity. Its 
foreign trade ventures are regulated by the business law and the 
other laws the government has adopted in this sphere. In view of 
the delicate nature of the arms production issue, he stated that 
"substantial and regular" consultations are held with the 
Foreign Ministry. Furthermore, Deputy Trade and Industry 
Minister Radomir Sabela takes part in all of the board meetings. 
It cooperates with Jan Ruml's ministry in testing new products. 
"We ensure that our activity is clean and above board," says 
Jiri Vich. 
  As far as the customers for our arms plants' products are 
concerned, the Czech Army apparently is interested in 200 of the 
modernized CZ 2000 tanks. However, the military will have a 
clearer idea about the kind of hardware it needs sometime in the 
middle of this year. The RDP is keeping in touch with the 
Defense Ministry and its experts. The governments of the Baltic 
republics are also potential customers. The first contacts were 
forged with them during Foreign Minister Zieleniec's official 
visit. "We are looking for serious customers that are not under 
an embargo," concludes Jiri Vich. 
  The RDP Group is not a trust and has no ambitions to become 
one. According to its press spokesman, it is trying to "keep 
together the special teams of experts we have." It believes that 
the chances of success in the market environment, first and 
foremost, for the smaller enterprises with a high percentage of 
special (read military) production will increase in a "geometric 
sequence" by means of advantageous cooperation. "We are their 
entrepreneurial device," said the spokesman, when he described 
his company's relationship with its shareholders. 
  Apart from modernizing the T-72 tank (the new product is 
called CZ 2000), the RDP Group is planning the "Overland" 
project. This is a military all-terrain vehicle with a Peugeot 
engine and transmission produced in cooperation with a French 
partner. At the moment, it is being tested by the Interior 
Ministry. Meanwhile, a secret product, "MARREL," apparently 
should make a contribution to the environment. So, to civilian 
production. Jiri Vich emphasized that the RDP Group wants, 
prospectively, to coordinate only 20 percent of military 
production up to the year 2000. Current production is dual, 
which means that some elements can also be used in the civilian 
sector. 
  Jiri Vich commented that the RDP Group is negotiating, first 
and foremost, on the transfer of "know-how" and new technology 
to the Czech Republic. Let us hope that weapons will not journey 
in the opposite direction toward regions where the entire 
democratic world does not want to see them.

<F P=106> [Interview with Czech National Bank Governor Josef Tosovsky </F>
by Martin Frydl; place and date not given: "There Are More Banks 
in the Czech Republic Than Is Healthy"] 
  [Text] [Frydl] Sir, what was the Czech National Bank's 
greatest success and failure in 1993, in your view? 
  [Tosovsky] The relatively stable purchasing power of our 
currency is the central bank's good result, and so is the 
creation of the new currency. In less than 10 months, we have 
completely replaced all of the currency in circulation. Greatest 
failure? Maybe the problems in the banking system. Specifically, 
problems in some smaller commercial banks that still do not have 
the skills to be able to evaluate risks cautiously. 
  [Frydl] In its projects up to 2000, the government foresees 
the growth of the GDP by 3.5 percent a year. According to some 
experts, this is too little to catch up with developed 
countries. Will it be necessary to "fuel" the Czech economy, now 
or in the future, by incurring a reasonable amount of deficits, 
for example? 
  [Tosovsky] This cannot be ruled out. At present, however, I 
would not evaluate the economic development by looking at one 
figure, albeit an important figure, such as the growth of the 
GDP. Our economy is undergoing principal transformation today. 
We are witnessing a decline in output, mainly in the primary 
sector, and growth in the secondary and tertiary sectors. Large 
enterprises are gradually giving up activities that have no 
prospects. These giants are undergoing a reduction diet. Look at 
the numbers of employees. Tens of thousands of people have left 
the industry and agriculture sectors and began working in 
services, trade, and private enterprises. Many people began 
working in banks. GNP growth is around zero, or slightly under 
zero this year. This represents the same sum of values as last 
year, or slightly less, but the quality of products and services 
is substantially different. 
  [Frydl] What would a budget deficit do to the economy, and 
when would it be possible to take such a step? 
  [Tosovsky] Budget deficits provide a possibility to 
stimulate 
demand in the economy and give the supplying side the 
opportunity to develop. Depending on the type of spending, 
deficits may have a multiplicative effect, however. In our 
current conditions, it would not be a step in the correct 
direction. Most likely it would have an impact on the price 
index and the growth of inflation. We do not believe that there 
is little liquidity or shortage of cash in the economy. A 
certain surplus has been caused by the influx of foreign capital 
in recent months. Aggregate demand is quite sufficient, but its 
weight is in private consumption rather than in investments. We 
would like to see more investments. 
  [Frydl] It seems that, instead of direct investments, 
portfolio investments are being preferred. Does such foreign 
capital bring what we need--that is, technology, markets, etc.? 
  [Tosovsky] We are not monitoring the utilization of foreign 
capital, only overall figures. It ensues from these figures that 
direct investments are actually declining. In previous periods, 
every year there were large projects, such as the 
Skoda-Volkswagen, or Philip Morris this spring. Such cases do 
not happen anymore, which has reduced the amount of direct 
investments. However, the number of investors has not declined. 
Direct credits from abroad--that is, credits from a foreign bank 
directly to our enterprises--are growing strongly. Very often 
our enterprise has a partner abroad, possibly a buyer of its 
goods, who provides guarantees to the bank, and the credit can 
be granted that way. Our entrepreneur is on his own; he does not 
have to establish a joint venture, but he accepts credits 
instead. For the money he receives, he buys new machines and 
improves his ability to export. The fact is that overall imports 
are growing, and machines and equipment, bought either directly 
or on lease, are a very important item in imports. According to 
an estimate, the portfolio investments--that is, the purchase of 
securities--reached between $100,000,000 and $150,000,000. This 
is only the beginning. 
  [Frydl] The stability of the portfolio investments is a 
problem, however. Are you not afraid of the movement of capital 
on our market while there is low liquidity? Does the money 
flowing to our country represent really well-considered and 
long-term investments, or is it "money adventurers" who are 
investing here? 
  [Tosovsky] Small and large investors have shown an interest. 
Recently, we noticed the interest of larger 
investors--institutional investors--such as pension funds and 
similar institutions. Of course, large sums can be moved quickly 
like that. However, the liquidity on our capital market is high 
enough not to pose a substantial danger. 
  [Frydl] Do you agree with the opinion that banks should 
initiate bankruptcies? If the banks initiated bankruptcies, what 
effect would ait have on the economic situation of the banks? 
  [Tosovsky] Bankruptcies in the neighboring countries, 
particularly in Hungary, are essentially solutions to some 
problems of the past. We have already dealt with these problems 
in a certain way. We have balanced the bank's accounts, written 
off the debt of certain enterprises, established the 
Consolidation Bank, and provided new capital to commercial 
banks. That is, we have already worked on the old debt problem; 
therefore, we do not have to initiate bankruptcies on such a 
scale as elsewhere. It is not necessary to throw away the names 
of the companies that still have a good reputation, or 
traditions that still have some value. Of course, the banks are 
considering every individual case and behave in such a manner so 
as not to cause damage to themselves. According to information 
provided to us, some bankruptcy proceedings have been launched, 
but the courts' capacity is insufficient. 
  [Frydl] What are the Czech National Bank's monetary goals 
this year? 
  [Tosovsky] Our principal objective is to keep control over 
the price development. We want to keep the inflation rate under 
10 percent. The government will take more deregulating steps 
this year and will increase certain prices, those that are still 
in the government's jurisdiction. This should increase the price 
index by some 2 percent next year. We are anticipating a monthly 
price growth of 0.5 percent. However, there are more factors 
influencing prices--wages, the state budget, just to mention the 
most important ones. To apply our monetary policy with the aim 
of lowering the interest rates is another main objective. We are 
getting prepared for the koruna's full convertibility, and we 
want to make our interest rates commensurate with those abroad. 
We cannot have the convertible koruna and interest rates several 
points higher than in the neighboring countries. Our goal will 
be to cut the interest rates, particularly interest on credit. 
  [Frydl] What should the money supply and the credit 
expansion 
look like this year? 
  [Tosovsky] The applicable figures have been published. We 
are 
anticipating an increase in money supply of 12-15 percent, 
approximately 10 percent inflation, and 2 percent growth of the 
GDP. In the beginning, we will be achieving the lower numbers. 
The monetary policy will be neutral. We still have a certain 
capacity for slight expansion. 
  [Frydl] Can you tell your opinion on cooperation between the 
Czech National Bank and the Finance Ministry? These institutions 
usually have contradictory objectives and roles. 
  [Tosovsky] At the most recent meeting of the Banking 
Council, 
the finance minister was also present, to which is he entitled 
by law, and we are quite happy that he uses this right from time 
to time. We discussed better harmonization between the fiscal 
and the monetary policy, which will become our key to success 
this year. As I said, the state budget is one of the independent 
factors in the money supply situation, which the central bank 
cannot influence directly. It is therefore necessary to know the 
trends of budgetary developments and the government's intentions 
and to closely cooperate. It seems that both sides are prepared 
for that. 
  [Frydl] The Czech National Bank is working on the 
introduction of the koruna's full convertibility. Could you tell 
us how far you want to go in liberalizing the capital account? 
  [Tosovsky] It may seem improbable, but our system is quite 
close to full convertibility. In principle, three things are 
involved. The limit on foreign currency purchases by the 
population will be abolished, the obligation of the exporter to 
offer foreign currency to the bank for purchase will be 
abolished, and the export of capital will be liberalized. When 
this happens, we only have to address foreign banks, open an 
account in our currency, and make foreign payments in korunas. 
We want to achieve this situation--that is, full 
liberalization--also on the capital account of the balance of 
payments [sentence as published]. 
  [Frydl] How do you view the Czech Republic's position in the 
world economic organizations, such as the International Monetary 
Fund and the World Bank? 
  [Tosovsky] Our position remains the same. In the 
International Monetary Fund we have the position of the 
countries that are providing assistance to other countries. In 
1990, we renewed our membership as a country that needed 
assistance. This is quite a good result, which we achieved in 
such a short time. 
  [Frydl] Do we have enough commercial banks? What should be 
their optimum number? 
  [Tosovsky] The number of banks is essentially an 
uninteresting number. We do not judge the situation according to 
that number. There should be as many banks as required to 
provide all of the needed services on the standard level. This 
is not the case in our country, not yet. Nevertheless, it seems 
that all those banks on the market are an unhealthy situation. 
We expect that their number will be reduced, some of them will 
merge, and the banking services provided to clients will improve 
and become of better quality. 
  [Frydl] The "retail banking" system--that is, really complex 
services for regular clients--is closely linked to this issue. 
  [Tosovsky] We have enough branches, but the quality of 
services must improve and their variety increase. 
  [Frydl] In your opinion, why have the foreign banks not 
engaged themselves in this sphere? 
  [Tosovsky] I cannot say that they would completely avoid 
this 
market, but it would mean for them to build a network of 
branches, which is expensive and slow.

  [Text] Departing for Bonn from Zagreb airport, President 
Tudjman said: 
  [Begin Tudjman recording] I would like, Croatia would like, 
this meeting to reach a solution. I initiated this meeting as 
early as last Tuesday, when it seemed that the talks between 
Deputy Prime Minister Granic and [Bosnian Prime Minister] 
Silajdzic would not amount to [word indistinct]. However, Mr. 
Izetbegovic delayed the meeting. You are aware of the 
situation that led to this delay; you know who shelled the 
runway in Sarajevo. You also know that Izetbegovic is now 
airborne and that he is on his way to Bonn. 
  I wanted this meeting so that I could tell the 
Bosnian-Muslim 
side that it is high time to stop their offensive against the 
Croatian population of central Bosnia; it is time for peace, 
because if the war should continue this will have catastrophic 
consequences, not only for the Muslim and the Croatian people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, but for everyone in the region. 
  Keeping in mind that, not only Germany but international 
diplomats--France, Germany, and Europe--have all offered their 
good services to make the meeting possible, they all want to see 
some kind of result. We will go and see. [end recording] 
  Asked if this was the right moment for negotiations in the 
light of a major Muslim offensive on the Croats in central 
Bosnia, President Tudjman said: 
  [Begin Tudjman recording] It is obvious that the climate is 
not positive. Muslim forces have been launching strong attacks 
in the Lasva River valley over the last few days, from Busovaca 
to Kiseljak. That is why I am going, in order to save the 
people, the civilian population, and to prevent the expulsion of 
100,000 more Croats. Our intention from the beginning of the 
clashes in Bosnia was to enable Croats to live in the 
Bosnian-Muslim republic and the Muslims to live in the Croat 
republic. That is why I have proposed this meeting and why I am 
going there where we will do everything we can. I believe that, 
for once, the Muslim leadership will have to realize that they 
should accept the hand of reconciliation in order to improve 
horrible relations caused by the conflict after the Serbian 
aggression. Like Croatia, the Muslims are still facing the 
Serbian aggression. Therefore, this is an unreasonable policy 
that should be put to an end. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Madeleine Albright, U.S. ambassador to the 
United Nations, left Zagreb this morning. [passage omitted] 
  I visited the mass grave at Ovcara and saw the devastation 
of 
nearby Vukovar in order to express U.S. support to the newly 
founded war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Ambassador Albright 
said at a news conference in Zagreb prior to her departure for 
Warsaw. All those who killed innocent children, women and men, 
must be brought to trial, she went on to say. I talked with 
President Tudjman about this. Individuals, the perpetrators of 
the crime, are those who must be brought to trial. The 
imposition of collecive guilt on a nation should be avoided, she 
said. 
  President Tudjman has confirmed that Croatia is willing to 
offer its full support to the gathering of evidence on committed 
war crimes. The UN Security Council demands the same from all 
other countries. The United States will not support the 
alleviation or the abolition of sanctions against Serbia if the 
Serbian side hampers the work of the war crimes tribunal, nor 
will amnesty of war criminals be supported, Ambassador Albright 
said. [passage omitted] 
  I am again expressing American firm support for Security 
Council Resolution No. 871 and for the territorial integrity of 
the Republic of Croatia. I wish to thank President Tudjman and 
the Croatian Government for the support they have lent us in the 
course of our stay in Croatia, and would also like to thank the 
UN Protection Forces for for having enabled us to visit Vukovar 
yesterday, Madeleine Albright said. 
  Replying to a journalist asking if the imposition of 
sanctions against Croatia will be examined because of its 
behavior toward Bosnia-Herzegovina, the American Ambassador said: 
  [Begin Albright recording, in English fading into 
superimposed Croatian translation] I discussed this with 
President Tudjman; we spoke about how important it is for the 
Croatian Government to use whatever influence it has over the 
Croatian Defense Council not to obstruct the dispatch of 
humanitarian aid, which is of vital importance. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Nikica Valentic by Aleksa </F>
Crnjakovic; place and date not given: "We Deserve a Favorable 
Judgment"] 
  [Text] Nikica Valentic, a 45-year-old originally from 
Lika, a lawyer by training and a modern manager by vocation, is 
not really a typical politician, although he has, by chance, 
been thrown into politics in the most direct way. He does not 
like public personal promotions, he does not speak in phrases, 
he is not entirely serious even when he explains the most 
serious moves of the government, he does not act to please, and 
he is not a political pawn. He knows what he wants, and he 
knows how to get it. People trust him; he is an authority and 
would be considered one even if he were discussing the spiritual 
life of mosquitoes, for example. 
  However, apart from the respect that he inspires when you 
talk to him, you feel as if you were sitting with a childhood 
friend who had suddenly appeared. We hardly managed to fit into 
his crowded schedule. Prime Minister Valentic works 16 hours a 
day every day. Who knows if he will get at least the first 10 
minutes of the New Year to spend with his family?! 
<H5>  It Is Hard To Assess Oneself </H5>
  [Crnjakovic] It has been nine months since you were 
appointed, which is long enough for an inventory. What could 
you say that you pride yourself on, without false modesty? 
  [Valentic] It is really hard to assess oneself, and that is 
not just a cliche. We are all subjective. However, when you do 
this kind of work, you have to do it with a certain amount of 
criticism, which we do. With all the self-criticism, I think 
that we deserve a favorable judgment for what we have done so 
far. I am not making excuses for myself when I say that we 
inherited a difficult situation. There was a war on, and then 
there were the consequences of the war, which, naturally, "gave 
birth" to the 30-percent inflation, heading toward 40 percent. 
We were quite aware that if we reached 50 percent per month, 
there would be no basis for recovery, and we would lose 
credibility. People did not believe that we had the strength to 
do anything radical, and they were nervous, but a week after 
taking over we started working on the stabilization program. Do 
you remember the troubles in April? That was when we took over. 
  [Crnjakovic] Do you mean the energy collapse in Dalmatia? 
  [Valentic] Yes, I am referring to the darkness in Dalmatia, 
which is only one of the many consequences of the war, not of 
the negligence of my predecessors. I am referring to the time 
when everything had to be done, the most important thing being 
to abolish the selective loans from the primary currency issue, 
so that the preparations for the sowing, the harvest, and the 
crop purchases could be made. For six months we worked on the 
basis for the stabilization program. The commodity and foreign 
exchange reserves had to be improved, and the disparity of the 
prices of electricity, oil, and gas eliminated.... We also 
created the minimal basis for the program in the banking system. 
When I list only some of the things offhand, it now seems that 
they were easy to do. However, they demanded a lot of energy 
and radical moves. In expert circles it is believed that 
spring, or the beginning of the year, is the ideal time for 
stabilization changes, but we had no time to lose, because in 
three months inflation would have reached 100 percent. 
  [Crnjakovic] In the last three months of this year you have 
managed to curb inflation. Was it perhaps done in an artificial 
way? 
  [Valentic] There are no surrogates in economics. We brought 
inflation down to zero, and it may even become negative in the 
future. There is no artificial inflation, since we have not 
frozen anything, either salaries or prices. The only question 
now is whether we will manage to keep public expenditure in 
check. Croatia has inherited a huge public debt, from old 
foreign currency savings accounts to bonds, the losses and the 
rehabilitation of the electricity generating industry, and the 
health system. We have managed to reorganize all these sectors 
to a large extent. The electricity industry is no longer 
suffering great losses, and we have prevented the health system 
from collapsing. At present, we are keeping all the important 
sectors under control. We cannot have another collapse of the 
electricity system, and we are now considering the means for 
providing energy for next winter, since we have taken care of 
this one. 
  [Crnjakovic] What about production, the main precondition 
for long-term economic stability? 
  [Valentic] We do not expect a drastic drop in production 
next year. It has dropped by 40 percent in the past three 
years, but that is because of the war. 
<H5>  There Is No Magic Wand </H5>
  [Crnjakovic] Are you expecting a wave of bankruptcies, and, 
hence, strikes? 
  [Valentic] There will be some bankruptcies, but no major 
ones. 
  [Crnjakovic] However, many people will lose their jobs. Has 
the government prepared any preventive measures? 
  [Valentic] Yes, we have secured funds to provide the 
incentive for creating new jobs, for the reorganization of 
banks, the shipbuilding industry, and some agricultural estates. 
My estimate is that there will be more "internal cleanings", 
reducing capacities, than bankruptcies. However, this is normal 
in any system. What is important is that the state prepares a 
social program, which we have done. In any market economy you 
have certain companies going bankrupt, and new ones opening, so 
people are on the labor market, and they get new jobs. The 
structure of the Croatian economy is to a great extent 
socialist, and changes always bring negative consequences too. 
However, that is a pattern that one cannot change. 
  [Crnjakovic] There is an impression that the government 
gives too little incentive to small entrepreneurs, a process 
which the sluggish bureaucracy ardently helps. To start a firm, 
you need to stand in line for hours just to get a stamp. 
  [Valentic] You are exaggerating. Anyone can open a firm in 
two days; there are no bureaucratic, customs, or tax barriers 
there. These are people who basically know nothing about 
economics, but interfere anyway. I accept criticism, but one 
should not exaggerate. We must simply realize that we were in a 
complete collapse, and that several governments will have to 
succeed one another before we create a stable economic system. 
There is no magic wand. If you push one lever, another comes 
up. As far as small entrepreneurs are concerned, I have to tell 
you that they are in a better position because they can cheat 
the state more easily than the big corporations, and we will 
have to put a stop to that. Do you imagine that we do not see 
that owners ostensibly pay workers 100 German marks [DM], so 
that they can provide fewer benefits, while they pay them 
another 200 "under the table"? We are not so naive. 
  [Crnjakovic] Is there a political consensus for the 
stabilization program -- does your team work together, or is 
there any banging under the table? 
  [Valentic] The government is a closely knit team. There was 
no dissenting voting at any of the many sessions, and we made 
all the decisions, after they were carefully gone through at 
coordination and working groups, by consensus. There have been 
some serious confrontations, because each ministry would like to 
get as much of the cake as possible, but this government will be 
remembered for being a team. If this were not so, the program 
would not have been successful. Anyone can attack the 
government, but it will not be easily shaken. A political 
consensus really does exist. Even the opposition, which, by 
definition, simply has to attack, offers significant support. 
There have been no significant reproaches to our work, from 
either expert circles or the trade unions. I am happy with the 
support that we have. 
<H5>  The Time of People Being Worn Out Quickly </H5>
  [Crnjakovic] Considering this general affection, we suppose 
that this government will last quite a long time. How long do 
you expect it will be in office? 
  [Valentic] Everything depends on future results. For the 
time being, we have a positive balance. The average salary used 
to be DM140, and now it is DM280. Our foreign exchange reserves 
were DM1.2 billion, and now they are DM1.3 billion. The 
commodity reserves have been increased by several hundred 
million German marks. Are these improvisations or facts? Our 
energy reserves have been increased, the situation with the 
supply of electricity has been stabilized, the health system has 
been reorganized, and the retirement fund is doing even better. 
The government will last as long as it endures according to 
market principles. At present we have a stable situation, there 
are no demands for anyone's resignation, and we have full 
political support. However, we are not deceiving ourselves. I 
am not saying that we can last very long. In our situation even 
several months is a long time, and a year is an eternity. 
  This is the time in which people are being worn out quickly. 
We had four government sessions in just one week before New 
Year, there was a parliament session, and another session was 
held, and on Monday we are starting again at full force. We 
will even be working on Epiphany [6 January]. This is a crazy 
pace. 
  [Crnjakovic] This pace will probably make your life as prime 
minister shorter? 
  [Valentic] This is not an excuse, but many know that I have 
serious arthritic problems. This is not an illness from which 
you die, but one with which you die. My illness demands a lot 
of rest, treatment at spas, and a quiet life with no travel or 
frequent changes of climate. But I will certainly not run away 
and leave those who trusted me, and gave me the support without 
which we would not have been able to implement the stabilization 
program. However, it is a fact that one cannot take this pace 
very long even when one is completely healthy. We work 16, even 
18 hours a day. Let us go back to the question, though: I 
believe that we will last six more months, which means that we 
will maintain production at this level, that there will be no 
inflation, social unrest, or strikes. If we succeed in that, 
then we will have done a great deal of work. 
<H5>  I Am Not Buying a Company </H5>
  [Crnjakovic] When you leave, will you remain in politics? 
  [Valentic] Never. When I am done with this job, I will go 
back to private business. 
  [Crnjakovic] What kind of business? 
  [Valentic] Some combination of law practice and modern 
financial transactions. I think I am one of the rare people who 
can organize a group of top experts -- lawyers, attorneys, 
financial specialists -- that can work on infrastructure and 
construction. I have no political ambitions; I am not going to 
buy any company. It is easier for me to start from scratch than 
buy old trash. Many will regret buying companies with old 
technology, and there are hardly any Croatian factories that 
have modern technology at the European level. This is at the 
same time a reply to the attacks of some who have bought up 
factories: Let them buy them! All those who lack 
competitiveness will fail. As for me, I will start from the 
beginning. If you are a little late in the beginning, you can 
make up for it by not having old organization, so when you start 
you are much faster. 
  [Crnjakovic] What is your comment to the claims that 10 
businessmen have bought Croatia? 
  [Valentic] These 10 people hold no more than 2 to 3 
percent of the social capital. At present there are 100 strong 
industrialists in Croatia, and tens of thousands of rich ones. 
Over 50 percent of Croatia has not been privatized at all. 
However, the property that has been bought is yet to be put 
into operation. I am not afraid that Croatia could become a 
"banana republic". There will be hundreds of industrialists, 
but there are also about 400,000 small stockholders. Even if 
half of them fail, there will still be 200,000. Unfortunately, 
some stratification will occur. 
  [Crnjakovic] You have recently said that it is better to 
have property belonging to someone than no one. Will we not 
wake up one morning to discover that our country is in someone 
else's hands? 
  [Valentic] When we open up completely, when there is a stock 
market, owners will change daily, so that the worker will not 
even know who he is really working for. This is also normal. 
We cannot have foreign capital and control over everything at 
the same time. However, we will not sell our property for next 
to nothing. 
<H5>  It Is Impossible To Return Everything </H5>
  [Crnjakovic] I must ask you the topical question: Will you 
be the prime minister who will start the process of 
denationalization? 
  [Valentic] I will start it, but I will not finish it. It is 
a very complex process. I am not one of those who think they 
can work miracles; I cannot promise such things. We will 
probably accept the Hungarian model of monetary restitution. 
How do you return someone's property that was taken away 70 
years ago, when you can not even return the property to someone 
from Vukovar? It is impossible to return everything. There 
will most certainly be no spectacular moves in that area. 
  [Crnjakovic] Are there going to be any spectacular moves in 
the tax system? Everybody is complaining that the taxes are too 
high, but no one can explain precisely what the essence of the 
new system is. Could you tell us? 
  [Valentic] Not in this kind of conversation. 
  [Crnjakovic] Could you at least say how it will influence 
the small man? 
  [Valentic] It will have almost no influence on him, as the 
rates are low up to certain incomes. Higher incomes are taxed. 
Even we, who have been working on introducing a new, 
internationally compatible tax system, are not quite certain in 
practice, and we expect difficulties in the first three months. 
Tax reforms are in fact revolutions; countries usually take 10 
years to prepare for them. There will be nervousness in the 
beginning, but in a year we will have a well established system. 
Its essence is that the total income is added up, and this 
amount is then uniformly taxed. It is impossible to explain all 
the taxes. I do not like giving interviews. I do not like to 
be superficial, and it is impossible to be serious and explain 
thoroughly. This is why I will give no more interviews. 
  [Crnjakovic] So I got in at the last moment? 
  [Valentic] Yes, you did. You reporters take sentences out 
of context, and then they are transferred, and put into the 
headlines. 
<H5>  The State Will Pay as Much as It Can </H5>
  [Crnjakovic] However, at least you know who to blame. What 
would you politicians do without reporters?! 
  [Valentic] Now, you do know that I understand your 
profession, and you also know that I am self-critical and that I 
accept part of the blame. However, it is simply impossible to 
resolve a problem in one conversation. You can discuss 
politics, but economics is a trade. 
  [Crnjakovic] You have had numerous interviews with trade 
union representatives, university students, old age 
pensioners... which one was the most difficult? 
  [Valentic] With disabled veterans, for emotional and moral 
reasons. We must do absolutely everything for these people. 
  [Crnjakovic] Will you? 
  [Valentic] They will come first; we have assigned DM163 
million for our defenders. I am also sorry for old age 
pensioners, who keep attacking me. We can start printing money, 
but then their pensions will amount to DM5, as in Serbia, 
instead of the DM200 that is the average pension now. I was 
advised not to attend the interview with the university students 
because they would whistle me down. However, that is also part 
of the job. I am one of those people who face problems, not 
avoid them. 
  [Crnjakovic] So did they whistle? 
  [Valentic] No, they greeted me with a round of applause. We 
had a very open conversation. 
  [Crnjakovic] One more topical question: What will happen to 
the old foreign currency savings accounts? 
  [Valentic] Whether the state should take over the public 
debt is a question. The state will pay as much as it can; we 
are servicing part of the interest. The state can not return a 
couple of billion dollars overnight, but we will do it in 
several years. We will reduce the public debt. 
<H5>  [Box, p 13] </H5>
<H5>  Like a Drill in the Stone </H5>
  [Crnjakovic] Will Nikica Valentic be remembered in history 
as the prime minister whose term of office saw the kuna 
[currency in use in fascist Croatia 1941-5] reintroduced? 
  [Valentic] Money is the reflection of the power of the 
economy. We must not jump the gun. An orderly economic 
situation greatly depends on the political situation, on the 
resolutions for these areas. However, I assure you that even if 
things get worse we will not give up our program, and will not 
allow the printing of money, so that we get the same situation 
as in Serbia, where monthly inflation is 400,000 percent -- in 
the Weimar Germany it was 30,000 percent. If the political 
situation remains as it is now, we will make more radical moves. 
If there is no more war and the situation gets better, we have 
the chance of keeping inflation below 3 percent per month. If 
production does not fall, and there is no social unrest, we 
could introduce the new Croatian currency by State Day. This is, 
I repeat, if there is peace. 
  I believe that I will be prime minister until then. I will 
consider my part of the job -- the first part of the second 
stage of rehabilitation and restructuring -- done. After that 
it is important that my successor continues where I started. 
You know, it is important not to keep changing the program all 
the time. I always compare myself to a drill in the stone: 
Sooner or later the bore will break, but it is not the same if 
it breaks at the first or the 20th centimeter, and if drilling 
the same hole continues, or a new one is opened. This time 
there will be no new holes; whoever comes after me will continue 
drilling. 
<H5>  [Box, p 13] </H5>
<H5>  The Mercep Case Should Not Be Politicized </H5>
  [Crnjakovic] Could you give me your political comment on the 
following: Dr. Greguric, a former prime minister, questioned 
the credibility of the press report on Mercep's troops. Certain 
information from one of the ministries, that is, the office 
headed by Mr. Manolic, obviously leaked straight to the press. 
What is this all about? 
  [Valentic] I am not familiar with the details, since I have 
not discussed it with anyone, but have only heard the 
representative's question and the minister's answer, like 
yourself. However, I can comment on it. It is up to the state 
attorney's office to start the proceedings within their 
authority and jurisdiction. In principle, I am against such 
cases being solved in the papers instead of in court. 
Information can be published, but in a legal way. 
  However, regardless of the press and the representative's 
question, the proceedings are under way, and all the material 
facts will be established -- the information in question is not 
a fact but circumstantial evidence. The government can not 
state a political position on this; it is up to the court to 
establish the truth and justice, and justice is always 
attainable, even if it is slow. Only the court can establish 
the facts. I will insist on making the process faster, so that 
the case is not politicized any further.

  [Text] Sarajevo, January 7 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb 
President Radovan Karadzic on Friday evening expressed readiness 
to make territorial concessions to the Bosnian Moslems in some 
areas, which are of less important for the Serb people, in order 
to arrive at a peace agreement. 
  Bosnian Serbs have measured how much they can yield at the 
next round of peace talks on the future of the former Yugoslav 
republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina scheduled for January 18 in 
Geneva, and that they "do not want a compromise when the 
statehood of the Serb republic is in question or its unification 
with other Serb lands," Karadzic said in a statement to Radio 
Studio S of the Serb republic. 
  Although Bosnian Serbs and Croats had secured Bosnian 
Moslems 
the required third of Bosnia-Herzegovina at the latest round of 
talks in Geneva and Brussels last month, Moslems again rejected 
the peace accord on Bosnia-Herzegovina as a union of three 
ethnic republics, saying they were not satisfied with the 
"quality" of the land. 
  Regarding the forthcoming Geneva talks, Karadzic said that 
he 
hoped they would be successful and also indicated that "enemies 
of Serbs are not devoted to peace and are not serious in the 
talks." 
  "The Austro-German bloc wants the war to continue and are 
constantly encouraging the Moslems to demand a unitary Bosnia, 
while the rest of Europe is against this," Karadzic said. 
  Commenting some statements to the effect that the United 
Nations protection force (?would withdraw) from Bosnia, Karadzic 
assessed this as a kind of pressure on the Moslem side. The 
international community actually wants to warn Moslems that the 
withdrawal of the peace-keepers would leave them all alone to 
face the Christian majority, which they could not bear, he said. 
  Speaking about the NATO summit scheduled for January 10 and 
11 in Brussels, Karadzic said that he expected new threats and 
pressures on the Serb side, although experience acquired so far 
indicates that methods of pressure, only on Serbs, can achieve 
nothing. 
  "The Atlantic treaty has been left without its business and 
its rival--the Warsaw Pact, and it is now trying to justify the 
funds of its tax-payers and its existence," Karadzic said. 
  "Such behaviour is very dangerous for us, since they see us 
as a great threat to European security. NATO must justify the 
large costs of the military-industrial complex which is behind 
it," Karadzic said.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 8 Jan (TANJUG) -- The results achieved 
over the past two years since the Srpska republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina was set up are fascinating, even though the 
entire Serbian people are suffering, president Radovan Karadzic 
said today in a program marking 9 January, Srpska Republic Day. 
The program was jointly broadcast by Serbian Republic Radio 
Studio S and Belgrade Radio's second channel. After all this is 
the war in which the Serbian people has experienced the least 
starvation and hardship and has suffered the smallest number of 
losses and defeats compared to all its past wars, Karadzic said. 
  In the first two years of all their past wars the Serbs used 
to lose most of their population, territory, and statehood, 
whereas in this war the opposite has taken place. The greatest 
part of the Serbian people and territory is protected while the 
Serbian army is superior, Karadzic said. 
  Commenting on the international position of the Srpska 
republic, Karadzic said he believed the military successes and 
political standing of the Srpska republic have resulted in the 
world's realization that peace can only be achieved by 
respecting a minimum of Serbian interests. 
  In the beginning we were regarded as rebels, then as 
secessionists, and now it is absolutely clear -- even the UN and 
Red Cross address us as Serbian authorities in Bosnia, Karadzic 
added. The Muslim leadership's attempt to nominate some other 
representatives of the Serbian people, Pejanovic, Kecmanovic, 
Tatjana Ljuic-Mijatovic, Miro Lazovic, has also been foiled 
because no one wants to talk to them. The entire world knows 
they cannot represent the Serbian people. They are only parts 
of the Muslim delegation. This is full recognition of the fact 
that we are in charge of our destiny, Karadzic said in 
conclusion on 9 January, Statehood Day of the Srpska republic.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 9 Jan (TANJUG)--At a ceremonial session of 
the Srpska republic assembly in Pale today, marking the Srpska 
republic's statehood day, the Srpska republic president Radovan 
Karadzic gave an introductory speech on the two-year long 
liberation war and the just struggle of the Serb people for 
peace and national interests. 
  In his address to the assembly deputies, representatives of 
the state authorities, and guests, Karadzic first pointed at the 
historical dimension of the centuries-long struggle by the Serb 
people to resist suffering and slavery, as well as the efforts 
to overcome all cracks and divisions in Serb national unity. 
  Emphasizing that the Serbs have spent this century under 
constant supervision, whose objective was to prevent any 
integration among the Serbs, Karadzic added that "the claims 
made by Catholic and Islamic international circles that the war 
in the former Yugoslavia is not a religious war are untrue. The 
wars in 1914 and 1941 were religious, and the war in 1991 was 
and is a religious war aimed at exterminating the Orthodox 
world." 
  "A large number of Muslims were nationally unaware, and 
there 
were even unaware Muslims who in ethnic terms declared 
themselves as Serbs, although they also took part in the 
genocide of Serbs because they were driven solely by religious 
motives," Karadzic said. 
  As far as political violence against the Serbian people is 
concerned, the president of the Srpska republic noted that the 
most pressing aim of Croatia's "democracy" was to exclude the 
Serbs from its constitution in the process of secession, while 
the first task of the Muslim leadership of ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina 
was to cancel the constitutional rights of the Serbian people. 
This political violence turned into the jihad warriors' battle 
cries, Karadzic said. He added that all the masks of fake 
Yugoslav values, fake communism, fake Europeanism, and of 
everything the Muslims had faked and worn as a mask since the 
departure of Turks from these lands had been dropped at the 
moment. 
  It is precisely Turkey's attempt to return to the Serbian 
lands as an empire that encouraged the local Muslims to attempt 
to oppress the Serbians again. This time, however, there were 
new Serbians, unknown to the Islamic east and Catholic west. 
This time their attempt at dividing and stifling the Serbians 
by Serbians was foiled. Apart from a few shameful exceptions, 
traitors and degenerates who could not be cured of their servile 
obedience and subservience, the Serbians as a whole united and 
reconciled as never before. They stood up and defended 
themselves, Karadzic said, stressing that their return to 
tradition and religion swept away the decades of rusty lies and 
delusions. 
  "Our political reply to their violence was, first, the 
separation of our deputies to the Assembly of 
ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina, followed by our proclamation of the 
Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and later of the Serb 
Republic. This took place exactly two years ago on Scepan Day 
1992. We replied by to their political violence with political 
moves and measures. We reacted to their dismantling of a state 
by building our state," Karadzic said. 
  President Karadzic then recalled, in his reminiscence of 
past 
events, that in the first 45 days of the war the people led by 
the Serb Democratic Party--as the main political power of the 
Serb people outside Serbia--stood up against the enemy. The 
armed Serb people became the Serb army in the best sense of the 
word, in the spirit of the best heroic Serb military tradition. 
A number of the JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] officers 
recognized in themselves the oath of their forefathers and 
volunteered to lead the units of the newly formed Srpska 
republic army. 
  "Despite all the lies and slander of international 
propaganda, the Srpska army has preserved its spirit of chivalry 
and its military honor, as befits it. All lies about the crimes 
committed by this army, having been used for the purpose of 
exerting pressure on Serbia and the Serbs, have already been 
forgotten, even by those who had launched them. Brilliant 
victories of the people's army, its military conduct, bravery, 
and heroism, have secured the existence of the Srpska republic 
and the Serb people and have made even the enemy and hostile 
international circles acknowledge and even admire Serb soldiers." 
  Deputies of this assembly, regardless of their party 
allegiance, with all their political struggle and other work, 
promptly joined the action of forming the army and even directly 
took part in the armed struggle, in which two of them--Goran 
Zekic and Milovan Bjelosevic--lost their lives. Milutin 
Najdanovic, our prominent federal deputy, was killed in a 
beastly manner in Sarajevo, Karadzic said. 
  Exceptional heroism has been demonstrated by the doctors and 
medical staff who in time organized the war hospitals that have 
saved the lives of a large number of our fighters, the president 
of the Srpska republic said. 
  Many of our heroes will not be mentioned in this limited 
speech, but they will be held in the Serbian people's memory, 
Karadzic pointed out. 
  Our generation's self-confidence and its trust in historic 
endeavor would not have been possible without the sense of unity 
in our people east and west of the Srpska republic, Karadzic 
stressed. The republic of Serb Krajina, which conceived the idea 
and national ideology of the Serb Democratic Party, is always in 
our mind as an example of courage as well as an obligation. 
  We must never forget, although we rather unjustifiably 
seldom 
mention it, the help of the people and leadership of Montenegro 
and the support of most political parties there. 
  Without Serbia's transformation, its rise from the ashes and 
the completion of its integrity and the resolve of the people 
and leadership of Serbia, we would not have an indispensable 
support and have no hope in success, Karadzic stressed. 
  Serbia is our beginning and our goal, our inspiration and 
hope, our cradle. All the calculations of our enemies have 
collapsed because Serbia--its people, leadership and political 
parties--have not been acting as they were expected to act. They 
did not let us down. 
  Our aim is to unite with Serbia. We are not going to conceal 
this. This is our right, which is identical to the right of a 
bird to fly or of a flower to boast of its smell and colors. 
  We have this right. For centuries we deserved a Serbia, and 
now we have finally secured it. Serbia deserves us too. Long 
live the Serbian people and all its friends. Long live all the 
Serbian lands that are called--in a word--Serbia, President 
Karadzic said in the conclusion to his address to the deputies 
of the people's assembly of the Srpska republic and the numerous 
guests at the ceremonial session marking its second anniversary.

  [Text] We have to broker a truce with our neighbors and 
embark on a revival of the economy and the restoration of our 
cities. We also demand the proclamation of the autonomy of the 
Banja Luka region and the setting of democratic elections for 
the assembly and government of the Krajina. This is stated in 
the statement released by the Banja Luka Regional Council of the 
Serbian People's Front just before the New Year holidays. 
  We were (?pushed) into battle in order to ensure that all 
Serbs live in one state, but 100,000 of us were killed in the 
process. In addition to this, we are threatened by an 
international slaughter. Our Krajina can live and prosper 
without Pale. That is why we demand that normal people be 
allowed to conduct political life. They are lying when they say 
that the corridor means life for our children, because our 
children have a greater need for living fathers. Corridors will 
abound in peacetime, and they will be as wide as our hearts. 
However, when we say all this, we are openly arrested and 
persecuted by Karadzic's henchmen. This is stated in the 
statement issued by the Banja Luka Regional Council of the 
Serbian People's Front.

  [Interview with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic by 
correspondent Beate Mueller-Blattau; place and date not given; 
from the "Villa Bonn" newscast -- recorded; Silajdzic and 
Mueller-Blattau speak in English with superimposed German 
translation; passages in italics processed from English] 
  [Text] [Mueller-Blattau] Welcome, Mr. Silajdzic. 
  [Silajdzic] Hello. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] Are such peace talks at all meaningful if 
some of the warring parties involved, that is the Serbs, are not 
participating? 
  [Silajdzic] Of course, there are questions that could be 
solved only among three parties, but there are also questions 
that can be discussed bilaterally. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] Which would you discuss bilaterally 
tomorrow; what are the most important points? 
  [Silajdzic] Well, unfortunately we have many points. Allow 
me to begin with the humanitarian convoys. Then there is a field 
hospital that we have been wanting to bring to Mostar for three 
months. But the Croat extremists do not want to let the 
hospital in. Then, there are the territorial issues and the 
status of Mostar. We have all agreed, of course, that the town 
is to be under EU [European Union] administration. Of course, 
we have to restrict to what extent the EU will administer the 
territory, and then there are many other things that we must 
discuss tomorrow. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] It seems that talks with the various 
political parties always only deal with territorial issues. 
Aren't the people far more important? 
  [Silajdzic] Yes, I hope you argue with the Croat side, 
because we always offer them no lines [boundaries] between 
us. It is the lines that lead to problems for the people. 
But they reject this, and they do not want to live together 
with us in one state. That is the problem. And when I say 
they, I mean those who have the guns and the power. I am not 
that sure whether the people themselves really want to live 
apart. For that kind of ideology is after all what caused the 
bloodbath; it started in Belgrade. It is a reality that they 
just do not want to live with us in one state. And I mean the 
Croats, who are the ones with the power. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] Lord Owen has savagely criticized the 
three 
parties. He said that all three only talk about peace, but do 
not really want it. What do you think of that? 
  [Silajdzic] Yes, I have heard this comment, and it is a very 
strange thing to say. I must say that it a major surprise for 
me, because he knows the truth, after all. Only two days ago, 
he said that Croatian troops and tanks are in Bosnia, and that 
amounts to intervention by the Croatians on Bosnian territory. 
Lord Owen said that himself. And he knows perfectly well -- we 
all know it -- who started the war there. It was the regime in 
Belgrade, with its expansionist desires and its intervention and 
aggression against Bosnia. Thus, there are two foreign armies 
in Bosnia. And on the other hand, there is a legal Bosnian 
armed force in Bosnia itself. If Lord Owen and others think that 
we are a helpless victim, it seems to be the case that we are 
only accepted when we are helpless victims. But that will not 
be true, because we will have to fight back. 
  That is why we are particularly angry at such comments. 
Those people that are dying in Sarajevo, and there is heavy 
shelling there, but also in Doboj, Tuzla, and Mostar. Lord Owen 
does not even regard it as particularly worthy of mention to 
discuss it. He discusses quite different things. Let me 
summarize: Bosnia-Herzegovina was attacked by the Belgrade 
regime and by Serb troops, and then by the Croat extremists. 
And now they [Bosnia] are unfortunately being attacked by the 
legal Croatian Army -- by the official Croatia, that is. Those 
are the facts. They all know that, and nobody denies it. 
  The aggression against Bosnia was facilitated by the arms 
embargo against Bosnia, against the legitimate Bosnian 
Government. Now we are producing arms in order to fight, but it 
looks as though they do not want to allow us to do so. And when 
we fight back, then they call us the aggressors, in our own 
country, on our own territory. And it looks as though some will 
prefer to see a Greater Croatia and Greater Serbia 
installed there at the expense of Bosnia. When we fight back, 
well, then they are frustrated, because we should have 
surrendered to them one year ago, but that is not going to 
happen. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] Lord Owen even said the Muslims are only 
striving for a military solution. 
  [Silajdzic] What he means is that the Muslims, or rather the 
Bosnians -- he always prefers to call us Muslims for certain 
reasons... 
  [Mueller-Blattau] For what reason? 
  [Silajdzic] The reason is to remind us what Islam means in 
historical terms in Europe, we have our name, we are Bosnians. 
But all this greatly surprises me. Are we allegedly supposed 
to want a military solution? Are the victims without arms 
really supposed to want a military solution? Isn't that a bit 
too illogical? One should consider what lies behind those 
words. It is as follows. We should have surrendered long ago. 
We should have made it easy for the Serbs to set up a Greater 
Serbia. That, at any rate, is what some governments in Europe 
believe, and unfortunately one of the mediators also thinks, 
from time to time, that we should have surrendered, that Greater 
Serbia and Greater Croatia should be created, all at Bosnia's 
expense and then we could all live together happily ever after 
in large tribes. 
  The reality, however, is that so far 200,000 people have 
been 
killed, and that is forgotten by Lord Owen and his friends in 
Europe. But we cannot forget and we will fight back. We must 
be permitted to produce weapons, because thanks to people like 
Lord Owen and others, there is an illegal and immoral arms 
embargo against Bosnia. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] You criticize Lord Owen very strongly. Do 
you believe he should give up his role as mediator? 
  [Silajdzic] Yes, after what he has said I think he should 
retire. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] Why? 
  [Silajdzic] Exactly because by what he said he showed that 
he 
does not want a Bosnia to exist, it is a Greater Serbia that 
must be installed. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] What do you expect from the United 
Nations? 
  [Silajdzic] That it respect its own decisions. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] Meaning? 
  [Silajdzic] There are a great number of resolutions by the 
UN 
Security Council that are nothing but pieces of paper. The 
United Nations is just like a piece of paper. If that is what 
it wants to be, OK. But if it wants to be a world organization 
that does something and does not just cover pieces of paper with 
writing, then it is a different matter. More than 100 states in 
the United Nations General Assembly voted in favor of Bosnia. 
No attention was paid to that. If the United Nations is only 
there to help a few big rich countries when they need it, 
alright. But I think that should be changed. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] Today I talked with a representative from 
the UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees]. She says that 
all three warring parties are blocking the UN aid convoys. 
  [Silajdzic] For us in Bosnia the most painful things are not 
shells, the most painful things are lies. They come from two 
sides; one side watches as shells fall on us and the other side 
targets the shells at us. The point has been reached where the 
credibility and morality, specifically of the European 
governments and international organizations, are called into 
question. 
  If 200,000 people die because of one aggressor, then these 
dead can only be on one side and those they have killed on the 
other. There is an attacker and there is a victim. They want to 
forget that because they do not want to get involved. That is 
the problem. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] Are there cases where your soldiers, your 
troops, have been hindering the UN aid convoys? 
  [Silajdzic] I do not think so, because who needs it? The 
Bosnian population is now being encircled, is living in ghettos, 
mostly surrounded by Serb units. It is quite clear who needs 
aid and who is hindering that aid. The international 
organizations have to be precise. If you hear that again from 
the UNHCR representative, ask for details. Who, for example, is 
preventing the Danish troops from reaching Srebrenica? Who is 
preventing Tuzla airport from being reopened? Who is preventing 
the field hospital from being brought to Mostar? Ask her, and 
then you will hear the answer. 
  The United Nations only ever talks about all three warring 
parties. You know why? Because they do not want to get 
involved. For them the 200,000 people, among them 14,000 
children, are the same as those who killed them. That is 
Europe, that is a disgrace. But that is European bureaucracy, 
those are not people. That has to change because these people 
are bringing us into difficulties, they are bringing the whole 
of Europe into difficulties. These incompetent European 
bureaucrats might just drive us into a third world war. I do 
not know whether you realize that, but it is important for us 
recognize this. This is about human lives, this is about our 
future, the future of the region, the future of Europe, and 
these incompetents must go. This is the time to tell them to go. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] You say they must go. What is to happen 
after that? 
  [Silajdzic] The European Community should finally implement 
the UN Security Council resolution, immediately.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "`Delta' Killed Juka Prazina"] </F>
  [Text] How and why was Mr. Jusuf Prazina, also known as 
Juka, killed in Liege in Belgium? There are various stories 
about it, and the Belgian police is carrying out an intensive 
search for a possible murderer. VJESNIK was informed of a series 
of details in connection with this crime from reliable 
intelligence sources. It can be concluded that Juka Prazina was 
the victim of a well-conceived plan made at the Supreme Command 
Headquarters of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Prazina's murder resulted from the fact that this Muslim -- 
who distinguished himself as one of the organizers of the 
defense of Sarajevo during the first days of war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina -- did not accept Izetbegovic's 
fundamentalist politics; moreover he and a group of his soldiers 
joined the Croatian Defense Council. There were many rumors 
about Juka Prazina even while he was alive. People know that he 
had his headquarters on the Jahorina Mountain near Sarajevo 
during the first days of the war. The name of this mountain was 
taken by Juka's murderers as the name of the action of his 
assassination. 
<H5>  Cover-up of Crime </H5>
  The murder was carried out by five members of the "Delta" 
unit. It is a unit for special purposes at the Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Supreme Command Headquarters. The commander 
of the unit is Mr. Ismet Bajramovic, known as Celo, who 
personally led the action against Juka Prazina. The money for 
the logistical support was provided by Bakir Izetbegovic, the 
son of Alija Izetbegovic, who has been out of Sarajevo for six 
months already. He often travels between Brussels, Paris, 
Frankfurt, Baghdad, Teheran and Ankara using Pakistani and Iraqi 
passports. 
  The "Delta" unit consists of 270 persons, the majority of 
whom come from Sandzak. They were selected by Mr. Ejup Ganic 
personally. For some time "Delta" was under the direct command 
of Mr. Sefer Halilovic, the former commander in chief of the 
Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Recently it has been noticed that 
the "Delta" has been performing its actions together with the 
"Laste" unit. The latter is the sabotage unit of the Ministry 
of Internal Affairs of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Its commander is Mr. 
Bakir Alispahic, the minister of internal affairs of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  It is worth mentioning that some actions of the "Delta" and 
"Laste" units were performed in cooperation with some sections 
of the later dissolved 10th Mountain Brigade of the Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, as for example the action in the village of 
Grbavica, close to Kojic, in which 28 Croats were brutally 
killed. The commander of this action was the notorious Zulfikar 
Alispaga, called Zuk. Mustafa Topalovic-Caco, the commander of 
the 10th Mountain Brigade at that time, also participated in the 
action. 
  Several months later Caco was killed in one of the internal 
clashes among members of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 
Sarajevo. This was explained to the public as an action 
organized by the military and civilian authorities of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina against war profiteers, but it was 
established later on that the persons removed were witnesses of 
the crimes committed in Grbavica. Nine soldiers of the 10th 
Mountain Brigade who, together with Caco, participated in the 
massacre of innocent Croats were killed, too. 
<H5>  "Logistics Expert" Fled to Khartoum </H5>
  The information that reached VJESNIK from intelligence 
services claim that the notorious Hasan Cengic is involved in 
the murder of Juka Prazina. He is the man whose name was 
mentioned in connection with the scandal that broke out at 
Maribor Airport after smuggled weapons had been discovered. 
There is evidence that he fled from Slovenia via Vienna to 
Khartoum after large quantities of weapons had been revealed. 
  In the government of Bosnia-Herzegovina Hasan Cengic 
performs 
the function of head of logistics for the Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Many foreign analysts think that he, 
together with Rusmir Muhmudcehaic, is the man who has the 
biggest political influence on Alija Izetbegovic, who was long 
ago his prison companion in Zenica. 
  The "Jahorina" action was already planned in October 1993, 
and Juka Prazina's travels around Europe were followed by three 
"Laste" members and three Palestinians, members of the 
pro-Syrian Al Saqe group. The cooperation between the "Laste" 
and this Palestinian group dates back to the time when the 
unsuccessful "Efendija" action, in which Fikret Abdic was to 
have been murdered, was carried out. VJESNIK wrote about this 
action in detail, Abdic also spoke about it in an interview 
given to a Croatian daily. 
  When the commanders of the "Jahorina" action realized that 
Juka Prazina would stay in Belgium for a longer period of time, 
Ismet Bajramovic-Celo gave the sign for the final stage of the 
plan to start. Bakir Izetbegovic and Hasan Cengic, who arrived 
in Belgium for this purpose with a Pakistani passport, supplied 
the five members of the "Delta" unit with weapons, rented cars 
and false documents. Two "Saab" cars and a "Peugeot" were used 
in the action. According to information that reached VJESNIK 
from intelligence sources, some of these details are already 
known to the Belgian police. 
<H5>  Hit Lists </H5>
  One of the Al Saqe members who followed Juka Prazina made an 
appointment with him at a highway car park, after introducing 
himself as a weapons dealer. The assassins waited for Prazina, 
who came to the meeting in a "Golf." When he got out of the 
car, he was shot dead by the assassins. His body was left in a 
canal close to the highway, and his car was removed to avoid the 
attention of other drivers and the police. That is why 
Prazina's body was only discovered by pure coincidence 10 days 
after the murder. 
  The following day the assassins left for Khartoum via 
Brussels, Paris, and Cairo. Bakir Izetbegovic returned to 
Baghdad, and Hasan Cengic flew to Islamabad with a false 
Pakistani passport. The three members of the "Laste" unit left 
for Frankfurt the day before the assassination took place, and 
the Palestinians from the Al Saqe group are probably still in 
Belgium. 
  Reliable sources claim that the "Jahorina" action is yet 
another of the actions planned by the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Supreme Command against those Muslims who do not accept Alija 
Izetbegovic's politics. According to well-informed sources, a 
large number of respected Muslim intellectuals who live in 
Croatia and Europe are on the list of persons to be removed.

  [Text] Petrovac, 10 Jan (TANJUG) -- Fierce clashes in Cazin 
Krajina continued last night and today between members of the 
Muslim Army loyal to Izetbegovic and supporters of Fikret Abdic, 
local Muslim sources have announced. 
  The same sources add that the forces of the [pro-Abdic] 
autonomous province of western Bosnia [APZB], using all 
available means, have taken the village of Trzac [northwest of 
Cazin] and inflicted great losses on the army loyal to the 
Sarajevo authorities. 
  Izetbegovic's forces, using infantry and artillery weapons, 
are trying to break through the demarcation lines and infiltrate 
inside the APZB, but are not succeeding. The [pro-Abdic] 
Western Bosnian news agency, ZBIA, reports that both sides have 
suffered a large number of dead and injured.

  [Text] Sarajevo, Jan 10 (AFP) -- Bosnian Moslem and Croat 
forces were locked in "heavy fighting" Monday in central Bosnia 
even as peace talks between the two sides took place in Germany, 
UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] and conference officials said. 
  The Moslem-led Bosnian forces Sunday tried to cut the road 
linking the Croat-held enclaves of Vitez and Busovaca, but were 
pushed back by Croat HVO [Croatian Defense Council] forces, 
according to UNPROFOR spokesman Bill Aikman. 
  Clashes continued Monday with street fighting reported in 
the 
village of Buhine Kuce, on the southeastern outskirts of Vitez, 
according to HVO officials in Zagreb. The officials, quoted by 
HINA news agency, said the latest fighting had left at least 
eight dead and 35 wounded. 
  Meanwhile, Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic and his 
Croatian counterpart Franjo Tudjman held further talks near Bonn 
Monday morning on the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The talks, which began Sunday evening, were being held 
behind 
closed doors amid strict security. 
  In Sarajevo, the airport remained closed to all but UNPROFOR 
flights Monday after renewed shelling of the tarmac Sunday 
morning. The shelling, attributed to the Serbs, delayed 
Izetbegovic's departure for Bonn. 
  Speaking at the NATO summit in Brussels, US President Bill 
Clinton warned Monday that the western alliance should be 
prepared to implement threats of intervention in Bosnia if the 
situation there did not improve. 
  Action and not rhetoric was needed to stop the 
"strangulation" of Sarajevo and other UN-declared "safe areas" 
in Bosnia, Clinton said on the first day of a two-day North 
Atlantic Treaty Organisation summit. 
  "Those who attack Sarajevo must understand that we are 
serious," he said, pointing the finger at the besieging Serb 
forces. 
  France and other countries have been lobbying for NATO air 
strikes on the Bosnian Serbs, as threatened in August, to stop 
the shelling of Sarajevo. 
  Meanwhile, one of the French humanitarian organisations 
engaged in providing relief aid to Sarajevo, Premiere Urgence, 
said Monday it would stop sending convoys to the Bosnian capital 
because besieging Serbs now demanded 50 percent of all aid 
provided in exchange for allowing trucks through. 
  Speaking in Sarajevo, the new representative for the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees, Kris Janowski, Monday outlined the 
plight of 75,000 Moslems trapped in another flashpoint -- 
Mostar, in the south of the country -- saying they were forced 
to live "like rats" in cellars under constant bombardment. 
  Janowski, who had just returned from the city where Moslems 
and Croats are engaged in fierce fighting, said the Moslem-held 
city's eastern enclave had neither electricity nor drinking 
water. 
  Inhabitants had to run a gauntlet of snipers to get water 
from the Neretva River which divides the city and the two 
warring sides, and it had so far proved impossible to get Croat 
authorization to bring in a water-purification unit. 
  Food and medicine relief was getting through, but the Croats 
were doing their best to prevent the Moslems from getting other 
goods, including oil, the spokesman also said. Fortunately, the 
winter had so far proved mild, he added. 
  Meanwhile, Sarajevo's OSLOBODJENJE newspaper Monday 
published 
an article praising the work done here by UN commander General 
Francis Briquemont, who recently asked to be relieved of his 
command after criticizing UN action. 
  The "upright officer," who has spend six months here, could 
not agree to remain as a neutral observer, the paper said.

  [Text] [Ivica Saric reporting] The Muslim army continued 
its attacks on our army in the Lasva valley [central Bosnia] 
this morning -- Ivica Saric reporting from Vitez for Croatian 
radio. 
  An artillery and infantry attack was carried out at 0635 
[0535 GMT] from the direction of Travnik and Slimena towards the 
Vitez area against the [Croat] defense forces comprising the 
Stjepan Tomasevic Brigade and the Travnicka Brigade in the area 
of (?Smrinka) and Nevic Polje. Forty inmates from Travnik 
prison, who have been promised an amnesty if they break through 
the positions of the Croat Defense Council [HVO], are also in 
the aggressors' formations. After fierce fighting the attack 
was repelled. The HVO suffered one killed and two wounded, and 
the indications are that the Muslim army suffered at least five 
killed and many wounded. In addition, the defenders succeeded 
in seizing an M-84 machine gun. 
  An attack of similar strength was also repelled in the area 
of Kruscica in the region of (?Sofe). At 0750 [0650 GMT] the 
enemy army continued the attack it suspended last night on the 
(?Buhina Kuca) region and the Vitez-Busovaca road. Here the 
aggressor is trying to expand the territory it occupied 
yesterday, which is 100 metres by 150 metres. In the fierce and 
[word indistinct] fighting for every house and every square 
metre the HVO formations are, for the time being, thwarting the 
intentions of the Muslim army. 
  As regards the often mentioned Vitez-Busovaca road, it is 
worth saying that it has been out of action throughout the 
period of Muslim aggression, so there is no question of the 
cutting of communications between Vitez and Busovaca. 
  According to information which has reached the area of Vitez 
so far, the consequences of yesterday's Muslim offensive are 
serious -- seven killed and 35 wounded, while 35 people are 
listed as missing, and of these 14 are women, of whom it is 
known that they have sought refuge in a safe village not far 
from the focus of yesterday's Muslim offensive.

  [Excerpts] This is Ivica Saric reporting for Croatian radio 
from Vitez [passage omitted] 
  The HVO [Croatian Defense Council] units have the initiative 
now and they are trying to retake control of the Vitez-Busovaca 
road. Fierce hand-to-hand combat is still going on. Muslim 
artillery attacks are continuing. More than 100 shells landed 
on Vitez by 1600 and over 200 shells of various caliber were 
fired on the defense lines. Five elderly people and one child 
were killed and 35 civilians were wounded, including many 
children. The defenders have also suffered casualties in heavy 
fighting. [passage omitted] 
  As I am filing this report, dozens of shells are falling on 
Vitez and according to military sources, the Muslim army is 
bringing in fresh units and military equipment from Zenica so 
that new, even stronger, aggressor attacks are expected during 
the night or morning on this part of the front in the Lasva 
river valley.

  [Text] At 0500, Muslims began a ferocious combined infantry 
and artillery attack and took the northeast approaches to Vitez 
and the village of Buhine Kuce, thus cutting off the 
Vitez-Busovaca road. Eight thousand civilians and 7,500 Croat 
refugees are encircled in Busovaca. Our correspondent in Vitez 
reports that fears are increasing of a tragedy on the scale of 
Krizancevo Selo as the lives of 50-60 civilians from Buhine Kuce 
are in danger. 
  We have just received a report from the Vitez operational 
zone command that troops of the British UN battalion are 
patrolling the Vitez-Busovaca road, extending their protection 
to civilians fleeing from Buhine Kuce and transporting them to 
Vitez. Six people have been taken care of so far, and a British 
liaison officer said that members of their tank units, located 
by the road, saw the bodies of two civilians. 
  By 0800, three people were killed and 15 injured in the 
ongoing artillery attack on the center of Vitez. The HVO's 
[Croatian Defense Council] 111th Zepce Brigade reported that 
Muslims were also launching artillery attacks on Zepce and that 
many have been wounded there as well. 
  According to the latest information, Muslims are attacking 
the Kuber area near Vitez from the direction of Zenica, while 
the HVO reports that the Muslim breakthrough in the Buhine Kuce 
area has been halted.

  [Text] Zagreb, Jan 7 (AFP) -- British UN troops have 
exhumed a mass grave containing the bodies of 27 Croats killed 
by Bosnian Government troops in a village near the central 
Bosnian town of Vitez, a UN spokesmans said Friday. 
  Bosnian Croats forces (HVO) have accused the 
Moslem-dominated 
government army of massacring some 50 civilians in an attack on 
the village of Dubravica on December 22 and have demanded an 
international inquiry. 
  British forces in the area began a search for graves and on 
Thursday exhumed 27 bodies from a trench in the presence of UN 
military and European Community observers, but said they had no 
concrete evidence of a massacre. 
  Lindsey French, a spokeswoman for the British battalion 
contacted in Split, said the bodies were all dressed in HVO 
uniforms all carried "wounds received in a battle." 
  "We have no indication of any form of massacre," she said.

  [Text] Moslem Radio Sarajevo reported on Saturday that a 
huge column of Croatian military vehicles is leaving from the 
Bosnian Croat-controlled town of Tomislavgrad in western 
Herzegovina and the town of Prozor towards central 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, where fierce Moslem-Croat fighting continues. 
  It is obvious, the radio said, that a big operation is in 
question and that the general staff of the army of neighbouring 
Croatia is involved. 
  Since the beginning of the 21-month-old war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina over 50,000 regular troops of Croatia's Army 
have fought on the side of Bosnian Croats. 
  Radio Sarajevo also said helicopters of the regular Croatian 
Army have been flying to and fro throughtout the night between 
Friday and Saturday on the course Croatia-western 
Herzegovina-central Bosnia despite the no-fly zone over 
Bosnia-Herzegovina introduced in October 1992 by the United 
Nations. 
  A woman and three children were wounded on Friday in Gornji 
Vakuf in central Bosnia-Herzegovina during Croat fire from 
mortars, howitzers, tanks and multiple-rocket launchers on 
Moslem-controlled parts of the town, the radio said.

  [Text] Bratunac, Jan 9 (TANJUG) -- Moslem troops in 
Sarajevo are increasingly using civilian facilities to fire at 
the Serb positions in that city, sources in the Bosnian Serb 
army said on Sunday. 
  The Moslems are firing at us over the positions held by U.N. 
peace-keepers from their strongholds in hospitals, post 
buildings and other exclusively civilian facilities, the sources 
add. 
  The aim is obviously to try to provoke us into neutralizing 
these Moslem nests so that we could then be blamed for attacking 
civilian targets, they explained. 
  The same sources said that the Moslems had used the same 
tactics before to fire at Serb and U.N. positions in Sarajevo, 
the capital of war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The Serb side has protested with the U.N. Protection Force 
over this practice, but to no avail. 
  Moslem provocations in Sarajevo continue on Sunday, with the 
brunt of the Moslem mortar fire directed at Serb-controlled 
sections of Ilidza, Nedzarici, Grbavica, Dobrinja 4, Vogosca and 
Rajlovac, the Bosnian Serb Army said. 
  Over the past 24 hours, the Moslems were attacking Serb 
military and civilian targets throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina, it 
added. 
  Bosnian Serb troops are firmly holding their positions and 
responding only when absolutely forced to do so, the Bosnian 
Serb army said. 
  It added that the Moslem troops in the Gorazde enclave in 
the 
east continued their attacks on Serb-controlled Foca and Cajnice. 
  Sources in the Bosnian Serb Army also said that, despite a 
U.N. ban on military flights over Bosnia, Moslem helicopters 
were flying from Orasje to Gradacac and Tuzla in northern 
Bosnia, and over the areas of Vares, Breza, Visoko, Kiseljak and 
Vozuce in central Bosnia, where Moslems and Croats have been 
fighting pitched battles since the spring of 1992. 
  The Serb side has duly informed the U.N. command about the 
unauthorized Moslem helicopter flights, the Bosnian Serb 
military sources said and added that the U.N. command had failed 
to react to an earlier warning from the Bosnian Serb command 
that unless such flights stopped, the Bosnian Serb anti-aircraft 
defence would be forced to itself prevent similar incidents from 
recurring.

  [Text] Ten megawatts of electricity are reaching Sarajevo 
today. This is enough only for basic humanitarian needs. The 
Serbian side still has not given its approval for beginning 
repairs on the Reljevo-[name indistinct] long distance

supplied with electricity. 
  The waterworks information service informs that they are

improving. Water is being supplied every day or every other

is no possibility of alternately supplying water in a part of

  [Text] Beograd, 7 Jan (TANJUG) -- Following yet another 
incident on the Yugoslav-Albanian border, which again seriously 
violated the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia, when, on 3 January in the area of the Krstace border 
watchtower an Albanian citizen lost his life while trying 
illegally to enter the FRY territory, the Federal Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, while regretting the tragic event, emphasizes 
that the sole responsibility for the incident lies with the 
Albanian Government, which has constantly been stirring tension 
at the Yugoslav-Albanian border with the aim of straining 
bilateral relations, destabilizing the situation in the 
autonomous province of Kosovo, and Metohija, and wider in the 
Balkans region in order to realize its greater Albanian 
aspirations. 
  With regard to this incident, the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry 
said today, the Albanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued 
a statement which, in a well-known manner, shifts responsibility 
to the Yugoslav side in an attempt to discredit the leadership 
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Serbia before the 
international community, although admitting at the same time 
that the incident had taken place on Yugoslav territory. 
  According to an agreement between the two governments on 
measures to prevent and resolve incidents on the 
Yugoslav-Albanian border, a meeting of a local mixed commission 
for border incidents has been place. It was established at the 
meeting that the Albanian citizen concerned had on one other 
occasion been stopped by the Yugoslav border guards while 
attempting illegally to cross the state border and had been 
handed over to the Albanian authorities. The statement by the 
Albanian Foreign Ministry clearly shows that this is yet another 
attempt to abuse the tragic incident for an unprovoked attack on 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
  Contrary to all international norms and standards, the 
government of the Republic of Albania has continued to 
underestimate the importance of its border with the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia, and also with its other neighbors with 
whom, as it is widely known, it has had serious border problems. 
Owing to the intentional policy of the Albanian Government, the 
victims have primarily been its own citizens. 
  The Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs wishes to recall 
that 
at a recently held session of the main Yugoslav-Albanian 
commission for border incidents, the Albanian side took over 
responsibility to carry out more effective border control and 
prevent all illegal crossings outside the marked border 
crossings. This was not observed by the Albanian side in the 
aforementioned case. Therefore it bears responsibility for the 
consequences. For all these reasons, and also for the fact that 
Yugoslav bodies securing the border acted in accordance with the 
law, the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs hereby rejects the 
unfounded accusations contained in the Albanian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs statement. 
  The government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has on 
a 
number of occasions expressed a willingness for the 
normalization and development of relations with the Republic of 
Albania, and has launched initiatives for meetings and talks 
between representatives of the governments of the two countries 
on all issues pertaining to bilateral relations, including its 
willingness to open new border crossings in order to improve 
communication between the two countries. This has not been met 
by the same willingness from the Albanian side. The government 
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia remains devoted to the 
principles of good-neighborly policy and peace, and will 
continue to pursue such a policy.

  [Text] Belgrade, Jan 8 (TANJUG) -- The final results of the 
early parliamentary election in Serbia show that the ruling 
Socialists have retained the lead, the republican polling board 
said on Saturday after the vote was repeated at 45 polling 
stations. 
  It has been known in advance that the second round of voting 
will in no way shift the balance of forces established after the 
first round of voting held on December 19, because only 0.5 
percent of the voters were asked to cast their ballots for the 
second time. 
  In the 250-seat parliament, the Socialist Party of Serbia 
(SPS) headed by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic retained 
its 123 seats (49.2 percent). 
  The Democratic Movement of Serbia (Depos), a coalition of 
five opposition parties headed by Leader of the Serbian Renewal 
Movement Vuk Draskovic, is second with 45 seats (18 percent), 
and the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) of Vojislav Seselj third 
with 39 seats (15.6 percent). They are followed by the 
Democratic Party (DS) which won 29 seats (11.6 percent) and the 
Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) with seven seats (2.8 percent). 
The Democratic Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians (DZVM), the 
party of the ethnic Hungarian minority in Serbia's northern 
province of Vojvodina, won five seats. A coalition of the Party 
for Democratic Activity and the Democratic Party of Albanians 
won two seats in Leskovac in southern Serbia. The ethnic 
Albanian minority boycotted the election in the southern Serbian 
province of Kosovo-Metohija, where they are the majority 
population. The republican polling board said that 4,300,440 of 
Serbia's 7,010,389 registered voters had turned at the polls, 
and that 1,576,287 of them supported the Socialists and 
2,168,467 the opposition. 
  President of the republican polling board Caslav Ignjatovic 
said that the new parliament should be constituted within the 
next 20 days, or by January 28 at the latest. [Word indistinct] 
Vice-President Goran Percevic said on Saturday that the results 
of the early parliamentary election in which the socialists had 
scored a convincing victory would enable the forming of a stable 
government in the republic of Serbia. 
  Seaking for the local radio in Jagodina, he said, however, 
that the SPS had not yet discussed the possible variants of 
one-party (Socialist) and multi-party governments. 
  It goes without saying that the Socialists would like to see 
a government capable of dealing with the issues of vital 
importance for the citizens of Serbia while the U.N. economic 
embargo is in force and of coming out with a programme of social 
and economic reconstruction after the international blockade has 
been lifted, said Percevic.

  [Text] The Main Committee of the Democratic Party [DS], 
which is meeting in the Belgrade Trade Union Hall behind closed 
doors, plans to discuss holding a vote of confidence in Party 
Chairman Dragoljub Micunovic and will set a date for an 
extraordinary convention of the party. Vladimir Nikolic has the 
details: 
  [Begin Nikolic recording] Apart from the official proposal 
of the agenda, members of the DS Main Committee were also 
presented with a proposal by Zoran Djindjic, chairman of the 
Executive Committee. For the time being, it is certain that 
the items on the agenda that are undisputable and up for 
discussion are reports on past elections and the election of DS 
deputies to the Republican Assembly. One has the impression 
that no one has anything against holding an extraordinary 
convention, so one may expect that its date will also be 
established. 
  What has attracted the public's attention is certainly the 
proposal by Zoran Djindjic, chairman of the Executive Committee, 
to hold a vote of confidence in Party Chairman Dragoljub 
Micunovic, which has confirmed the stories about disagreements 
and rifts in the DS' top leadership. 
  We have just learned at the DS Information Service that the 
proposal to hold a vote of confidence in Chairman Micunovic has 
received the necessary majority of votes from the present 
members of the Main Committee -- that is, that the 
somewhat-amended agenda proposed by Djindjic was adopted. 
  We would also like to add that when it was decided to hold 
the session behind closed doors, correspondents were told that 
they will be informed of the session's outcome by an 
announcement or possibly at a news conference. [end recording]

  [Test] Belgrade, Jan 10 (TANJUG) - The opposition 
Democratic Party (DS) will neither enter a coalition with the 
ruling Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), nor will it back a 
minority government in the Serbian parliament, the DS main board 
decided. The DS main board said Sunday evening [9 January] it 
would take concrete decisions only if a national unity 
government was being formed. The results achieved at the early 
parliamentary elections in Serbia were also discussed and the 
list of deputies to the parliament adopted. 
  The election campaign was conducted by Zoran Djindjic, the 
president of the DS Executive Committee and head of all DS 
lists. The DS main board discussed the confidence to the 
party's president, Dragoljub Micunovic, but the vote was put off 
until January 15, due to a lack of quorum. The vote on 
confidence to the president of the DS was demanded by 52 
municipal committees, out of a total of 90. 
  At early parliamentary elections, the DS increased the 
number 
of seats compared to last year's parliamentary elections, when 
it won only 7 seats. This year it won 29 seats, to become the 
fourth strongest party in the 250-seat parliament. 
  The SPS won most seats -- 123, but it was below the absolute 
majority line.

  [Text] Madeleine Albright and General John Shalikashvili, 
special envoys of the U.S. President, had talks with Slovak 
President Michal Kovac and other constitutional representatives 
today. Our correspondent Renata Havranova, editor of the daily 
PRACE, sent us this report: 
  [Begin Havranova recording] While Madeleine Albright talked 
to Slovak President Kovac, Gen. Shalikashvili held talks with 
Slovak Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak. Both representatives 
of the U.S. side later, at a brief news conference, expressed 
their great satisfaction with the course of all meetings with 
Slovak representatives. In their opinion, it is evident from 
these meetings that Slovakia can become the first country of 
Central Europe to sign the U.S.-proposed Partnership for Peace 
plan. Gen. Shalikashvili added that Slovakia had understood the 
U.S. intention to aid the stability and security of Europe by 
this plan without creating new dividing lines. 
  President Kovac replied to a question asking if he presented 
his recently published counter proposal to the U.S. guests by 
saying that he never had any counter proposal. On the contrary, 
he appreciates that the central motive of the Brussels summit 
will be a decision to build a qualitatively new relationship 
between NATO and other countries of Europe. The U.S. endeavor to 
support the security of our continent as a whole is, according 
to Kovac, self-evident. The Partnership for Peace plan is a 
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and also an instrument for 
Slovakia and other countries to draw closer to NATO. It is also 
an opportunity to expand the security and stability zone further 
east, the president said. Kovac went on to say that the Slovak 
Republic wanted to become an active participant in the 
Partnership for Peace plan. However, Slovakia expects that the 
acceptance of the other side, irrespective of its form, will 
also constitute a definitive decision about the geopolitical 
incorporation of the Slovak Republic into the NATO sphere of 
interests. 
  According to Kovac, through Partnership for Peace, the 
Slovak 
Republic has conclusively claimed its allegiance to Western 
states. [end recording]

  [Text] Jan Lisuch, state secretary in the Slovak Foreign 
Ministry, handed a memorandum about the coming NATO summit to 
the representatives of embassies from NATO member states, and of 
the Visegrad Four countries based in Bratislava. Ivan Mjartan, 
the Slovak ambassador in the Czech Republic, handed the same 
text simultaneously to the ambassadors of NATO member states 
based in Prague. 
  The memorandum states, among other things, that our Republic 
holds in high esteem the NATO project, also known as Partnership 
for Peace, initialled by the U.S. Government, and is prepared to 
join it and take an active part in projects and missions 
organized within its framework. This project will undoubtedly 
contribute to markedly intensified cooperation between Slovakia 
and NATO and its member states in political and military issues.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Peter Burian, charge d'affaires in </F>
Washington, by TA SR reporter Otakar Korinek, in Washington; 
date not given: "The Basis for Development of Relations With the 
United States"] 
  [Text] "In 1993, a sufficient basis for the functioning of 
normal bilateral relations between the United States and 
Slovakia was established. This process was exceptionally 
dynamic and smooth. From this point of view, the establishment 
of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Slovak 
Republic was very important, and so was the fact that Slovakia, 
as one of the successor states, took over treaties and 
obligations between the former CSFR and the United States," 
Peter Burian, charge d'affaires in Washington, told a TA SR 
reporter. 
  In 1994, the work of the ambassador will be to strengthen 
economic and commercial contacts. The interest of U.S. firms, 
such as Westinghouse and others, in investing in Slovakia is a 
positive factor. Moreover, we succeeded in establishing 
continuous working contracts with the International Monetary 
Fund and the World Bank. The conclusion of the treaty on 
avoiding double taxation between the United States and Slovakia 
was an important factor in the development of our trading 
contacts. Burian described as a success of our diplomacy the 
establishment of the conditions for Slovakia's being taken off 
the list of countries to which the United States does not export 
advanced technology (COCOM). According to Burian, the final 
decision is expected in the days to come. 
  "In the political sphere, we are going to invite a high U.S. 
official to Slovakia. There are many occasions for it, such as 
the 50th anniversary of the Slovak National Uprising," Burian 
said. He stressed that the basis for active relations was 
established in 1993 after the visit of the president, the prime 
minister, the National Council chairman, and other ministers and 
Slovak officials to the United States. 
  The work of the ambassador and pushing for the Slovak 
Republic's interests, in general, was complicated, to a certain 
extent, by the negative publicity about development in the 
Slovak Republic. Some sectors are underestimating the importance 
and the tasks of the embassy. They should address the embassy as 
the primary source of information and consult it about the 
preparation of any action having an impact on bilateral 
contacts. Otherwise, the embassy has to act as a fire brigade. 
Burian sees certain possibilities in cooperation with the 
community of Slovak countrymen. The activity of the World 
Congress of Slovaks, headed by a new leadership, is quite a 
pleasant thing. The premises for the embassy are a problem that 
still has not been sorted out. "In Washington, there is an 
unwritten law regarding prestigious matters. One of them is the 
fact that the flag of a state should be fixed in a certain place 
on the building. Even this helps build respect for one state or 
another in the U.S. capital." Burian described as very 
important the fact that, in January, the Slovak ambassador will 
arrive in the United States.

<F P=106> [Interview with Slovak President Michal Kovac by E. Fasung; </F>
place and date not given: "He Is Trying To Be 
Himself"--reprinted from Issue No. 1 of the weekly PLUS 7 DNI] 
  [Text] "According to the most recent public opinion polls, 
you have become the most trustworthy Slovak politician. To what 
do you attribute this trust?" asks E. Fasung in an interview 
with President Michal Kovac in PLUS 7 DNI [Plus Seven Days] No. 
1. 
  [Kovac] Already, while being sworn in, I declared my 
intention to be the president of all citizens. In my conduct, I 
want to fully live up to these words. I believe that a steadily 
growing number of citizens of the Slovak Republic realizes the 
sincerity of this effort of mine. I am trying to be myself, 
independent of parties and the government. 
  [Fasung] Efforts have recently appeared that were aimed at 
your scandalization. Do you think this was a reaction to the 
fact that you also uphold ideas other than those held by the 
ruling movement? 
  [Kovac] The scandalization of politicians is nothing new on 
our domestic political scene. Unfortunately, it testifies to the 
low standard of political culture that has struck roots here. It 
is important that we learn to deal with problems in a 
businesslike way, that we learn to rise above personal disputes 
or different political views, and that we learn to see even in a 
political opponent a partner who has the same interest in 
resolving the complicated situation in which Slovakia finds 
itself. 
  The present government emerged from the results of free and 
democratic elections and acquired a regular mandate for a 
four-year electoral term. In the event that the National Council 
of the Slovak Republic deputies arrives at the opinion that it 
is not functional, they have the constitutional right to pass a 
vote of no-confidence in it. In that case, following an 
agreement with the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] and 
consultations with other parties, I would appoint as prime 
minister a different personality, and ask it to form a new 
government. However, I cannot imagine this to be a government, 
in which the HZDS, which won the parliamentary elections, would 
not be represented. I am convinced that Slovakia needs a broad 
coalition government formed around the HZDS. Another possibility 
is to shorten the electoral term and call early elections, from 
which a new parliament and a new government would emerge, which, 
however, would have to be formed with the assistance of several 
parties. I consider it premature to speak about a specific 
person that I would ask to form a new government. 
  [Fasung] What is your relationship with Mr. Meciar? Do you 
also meet privately, or only in the course of your work? 
  [Kovac] My relations with the prime minister could be 
described as working relations.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "Roman Hofbauer's Rash Decision; Deputy Prime </F>
Minister on the Radio Free Europe Affair"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--In the opinion of Roman Kovac, deputy 
prime minister responsible for media policy, the decision by 
Roman Hofbauer, minister of transportation, communications, and 
public works, to end the operation of the U.S. Radio Free Europe 
[RFE] radio station in Slovakia is rash, and he does not 
consider it fortunate. Minister Hofbauer had not consulted this 
step with him, and he personally learned about it only from the 
press. 
  According to Roman Kovac, the Slovak Government has for some 
time had objections to the legal purity of the contract with the 
RFE, as well as to the nature of its broadcasts. "We do have 
serious reservations about the very small number of listeners of 
this radio station, which uses one of the best radio 
frequencies, reaching practically into Slovakia's every 
village," Roman Kovac stressed. He does not perceive this 
decision as a matter that would interfere with the plurality of 
views, but he believes that it is not good to resort to such a 
sharp step without previous consultations. However, he did not 
rule out that, following the reassessment of all of the aspects, 
the final verdict could be similar to that pronounced by Roman 
Hofbauer.

  [Excerpts] Our government delegation has returned from an 
official visit to Israel and Cyprus. Before departing from 
Nicosia, our special correspondent Igor Barat sent us this 
report about today's program. 
  [Begin Barat recording] [passage omitted] While Economy 
Minister Jan Ducky negotiated with the Cypriot minister of 
finance, Slovak Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik continued his 
consultations, which started yesterday, with his counterpart, 
Mikhailidhis. The two politicians talked about their experience 
in solving problems relating to a multinational society and 
agreed that recognizing individual rights for all citizens must 
not lead to interference with the integrity of individual states. 
  The two ministers of foreign affairs also stressed the need 
for an effective security system in Europe, which would give 
guarantees to all states and not just to selected ones. The 
foreign ministers also confirmed that Cyprus and the Slovak 
Republic have common interest in joining the European Union. 
  Ivan Laluha, chairman of the Slovak Republic National 
Council's Foreign Committee, and other deputies met Tasos 
Papadhopoulos, chairman of the Cypriot Parliament's Foreign 
Committee. They also talked mainly about minority questions. The 
Cypriot politician said that, in this sphere, his country has 
negative experience and that it has learned from this experience 
that it is not desirable to recognize too many rights for any 
minority, and that it is also not permissible for other states 
to get involved in solving these problems. We received this 
information from Ivan Laluha on the so-called Green Line, 
hermetically dividing the Greek from the Turkish part of the 
island. The Slovak Foreign Committee chairman noted: I hope we 
will never need to create something similar. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Immediately after the meeting 
of Visegrad defense ministers ended in Warsaw today, Slovak 
Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak gave an interview to our 
colleague Jozef Hybel. 
  [Begin recording] [Hybel] Minister, how satisfied are you 
with the outcome of the Visegrad defense ministers' meeting? 
  [Andrejcak] I am naturally satisfied. We agreed that all 
four 
countries would prefer to become NATO member countries 
immediately. All four countries will however accept the 
partnership for peace program. I am glad that our president is 
seeking a way that will enable us to become a member soon, at 
least in the political aspect. If we cannot realize the first 
aspect, let us hope that this idea of his will speed up our 
acceptance as a full member. 
  In addition, we agreed that we will continue all areas the 
original Visegrad countries set before themselves toward 
cooperation, and I proposed that, after clarification by a NATO 
representatives with regard to what the partnership for peace in 
fact is, we would meet to consider how to coordinate our steps. 
  [Hybel] Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia hold very close views 
on their future membership of NATO. The Czech Republic's view is 
however somewhat different. How do you view the endeavors of the 
Czech Republic? 
  [Andrejcak] Through its first deputy defense minister, the 
Czech Republic presented two variants. I believe that we cannot 
reproach them for this, as such an opportunity also exists for 
us. The other thing is that prevalent among the countries at 
this moment is the idea that they will be able to gain entry 
more speedily into NATO as individuals. I believe that life 
itself will show that cooperation is in the end a faster course 
than individual steps. They have not, however, rejected such 
cooperation. 
  [Hybel] Do you think that Slovakia is today prepared for 
entry into NATO? 
  [Andrejcak] I have not encountered a view that would assess 
our armed forces as being less capable than any other. However, 
this matter has another aspect. It is the member countries who 
make the choice. It therefore depends on their view and not on 
mine or that of our politicians. 
  [Hybel] How do you see the fact that Western politicians 
frequently forget to name Slovakia when there is talk about 
letting Central European countries into NATO? 
  [Andrejcak] Naturally, as with every Slovak, I bear this 
with 
difficulty. Nonetheless, let us remember that we have not yet 
succeeded in presenting ourselves to the world, so not everyone 
feels compelled to talk continuously about Slovakia. We must 
promote ourselves to ensure that everyone knows about us and 
that their knowledge of us is so strong that they do not forget 
us. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The general assembly of the elected 
representatives of the Hungarian minority of Southern Slovakia 
began at 1300 hours today in Komarno. Szilvia Enkakarov reports 
from the scene. 
  [Enkakarov] The organizers somewhat miscalculated the number 
of participants of the general assembly when they predicted 
1,400-1,500 people. A few minutes before 1300 hours, there were 
massive queues in front of the sports hall's entrance, despite 
the fact that the hall was already hopelessly full. Before the 
beginning of the general assembly, some 3,000 people entered the 
sports hall. 
  Among the guests are representatives of the government 
office 
headed by Ludovit Fliegel. Teodor Kriska and Roman Filister from 
the presidential office are also attending. [passage omitted] 
  In his opening speech, Istvan Pasztor, mayor of Komarno and 
chairman of the Association of Towns and Villages of Zitny 
Ostrov, greeted those present and read out the letter of Ms. 
Catherine Lalumiere addressed to the Komarno general assembly. 
It emerged from the letter that observers of the Council of 
Europe could not take part in the event because, in a few days' 
time, on 17-18 January, a four-member expert committee will 
visit Slovakia to learn about the Slovak Republic's plans for 
administrative and regional division. 
  The agenda read out by Istvan Pasztor was adopted by the 
participants. According to the agenda, the general assembly's 
four main topics are the legal situation of local governments, 
Slovakia's administrative and regional reorganization, the 
constitutional status of the Hungarians of Slovakia, and the 
report on the initiative for the association of the elected 
representatives of Southern Slovakia. The mayors and 
representatives present will be given the opportunity to express 
their views in the debate. They can analyze the topics they are 
most interested in, in three-minute-long speeches, said the 
mayor of Komarno. The mayor concluded his speech with the 
following thought, which received great applause: "Our aim is 
not to pull the country apart but together to try to solve our 
country's problems within the country's borders." 
  Speeches are being delivered at the moment. At the end of 
the general assembly, a news conference will be held in the 
Komarno town community center at 1700. My next report from the 
scene will be at 1730.

of Zitny Ostrov localities. [passage omitted] First policemen 
asked for documents certifying the payment of road tax, which is

  [Text] The meeting of mayors and deputies of legislative 
bodies from southern Slovakia opened in Komarno this afternoon. 
Jarmila Tosecka, our editor, will now highlight for us the 
atmosphere of the meeting. 
  [Tosecka] Good afternoon, the meeting in Komarno is at 
present reaching its climax. In the course of the past four 
hours, a number of mayors of towns and villages took their turns 
to make lengthier speeches from the platform, in which they 
appraised the current local government's rights, draft of the 
territorial-administration reorganization, and the 
constitutional position of Hungarians in Slovakia. 
  That part of the meeting's agenda passed calmly, despite 
critical reservations and fundamental proposals on the 
resolution of the problems. The ensuing debate, however, was 
marked by passionate words and statements. 
  At the close, the organizers acquainted the participants in 
the meeting with the content of the open letter they are sending 
to the Slovak president. Apart from other things, they appeal to 
the whole Slovak public with these words: Let us seek a path to 
ourselves but only on the principle of equality. 
  I shall now quote briefly from the final statement adopted 
by 
the participants in the national meeting of members of local 
governments, mayors, and deputies of legislative bodies from 
southern Slovakia in Komarno. The draft is currently being 
presented by one of the organizers: 
  The Central European space is characterized by, among other 
things, unsettled ethnical relations and accumulated tension 
that could lead to tragic conflicts. We shall do everthing 
possible in the interest of ensuring that such a conflict does 
not break out in the Carpathian base. It is, however, necessary 
to point out that ethnical problems must be tackled also here. 
For Slovakia, which gained independence in 1993, this means that 
relations between Slovaks and Hungarians must be built on new 
foundations. In the interest of this, it is necessary to create 
a new system of relations between Slovaks and Hungarians, and it 
is necessary to pass new laws. The steps taken by the government 
to date have contributed to the worsening of mutual relations. 
The new system of relations is to strengthen the basic pillars 
of democracy.

<F P=106> [Report by "NO": "Minorities as an Appendix of the State? </F>
Hungarian Civic Party on Slovak-Hungarian Relations"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--The editorial office received a 
statement from the Hungarian Civic Party [MOS] yesterday that 
states, among other things, that what is absolutely lacking is 
an institutionalization of the solution to the problems of the 
national minorities. Quite the contrary, the solution to these 
problems is being transferred to extraparliamentary forums. 
Individual components of power, political parties, and cultural 
and social organizations mutually interfere in their powers. 
  MOS considers it alarming that leading government and 
parliament representatives have endorsed the demands of the 
assembly of Slovaks from southern Slovakia held at Surany on 2 
January, which contain elements that are incompatible with the 
principles of parliamentary democracy and whose spirit and tone 
are reminiscent of the pre-1989 period. MOS does not identify 
with the appeal issued by the Association of Towns and Villages 
of Zitny Island because some parts of the appeal are not in 
conformity with the party's program. 
  The statement observes that present power holders regard 
ethnic minorities merely as an appendix of the state. All 
citizens, including members of the minorities, are a source of 
the sovereignty of the Slovak Republic, and, therefore, they 
rightly demand legal and institutional guarantees of the 
preservation of their distinctive identity.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ladislav Pilz, chief producer of the Slovak </F>
Television Production Center for News and Current Affairs, by 
Eva Zelenayova; place and date not given: "No One Trusts the 
Television Screen; Ladislav Pilz: Professionalism Has 
Disappeared From Television"] 
  [Text] Slovak Television has had a new chief producer of 
the Production Center for News and Current Affairs since the 
beginning of this year. It is Ladislav Pilz, whom we asked for 
an interview. 
  [Zelenayova] In spite of the many objections to television 
being raised, the change at the post of the chief of news 
programs has come rather unexpectedly. How was your appointment 
to this post explained to you? 
  [Pilz] Very simply. The previous chief, Mrs. Martina 
Kyselova, gave notice with effect from 31 December 1993. The 
Slovak Television management was looking for an adequate 
replacement. The fact that they chose me may have to do with the 
fact that I have been working in television for 21 years. First, 
for about two years, as a speaker, later as director of 
television news, and the past two years as deputy chief producer 
in the editorial office for sports. I know television inside 
out, and that was probably the main reason. 
  [Zelenayova] How do you assess news programs, and what would 
you like to change? 
  [Pilz] I assess them very critically. I think, first and 
foremost, that responsibility, decency, verification of 
information, the basic attributes of work in any genre--that is, 
not just when covering news--have disappeared from news 
programs. Although I do not like the term ethical 
self-regulation, the fact is that many people are lacking it. 
  [Zelenayova] Do you think that you will be able to put 
things 
right? 
  [Pilz] I have inherited a very young team of reporters. This 
team is very inexperienced but, on the other hand, also very 
adaptable. Slovak Television is short of the generation of 
middle-aged reporters. Even if they were tied to the former 
regime in any way, they were professionals who passed their 
experience on to the younger reporters, something we would need 
very badly now. Today's young reporters lack feedback and a 
certain control. Lack of concept is the prevailing feature. If 
you add to this indecent conduct, irresponsibility, and 
indifference, this cannot but find its reflection in television 
programs. 
  [Zelenayova] The most frequently heard objections concern a 
lack of balance, particularly regarding the representation of 
political parties in broadcasts, but also the Slovak Television 
reporters' one-sided view of domestic political developments. 
What is your view of this problem? 
  [Pilz] The shortcomings that I mentioned are, in fact, also 
the cause of the lack of balance to which you referred. There 
exist indications that some young reporters allow themselves to 
be carried away by some vision of a party or a movement, and 
that detachment or plurality are alien to them. I would like to 
create such an atmosphere that people will trust us. Today the 
situation is such that we are not trusted by politicians, fellow 
journalists, or viewers.... Not even teachers of Slovak trust us 
because 90 percent of the television staff speaks nonliterary 
Slovak. What will be the first step? If they want and are 
willing to raise their professionalism [as published]. But not 
tendentiously, opportunistically, and mendaciously. That is the 
only way to achieve that viewers will, perhaps, trust us. And 
that is work for several years.

<F P=106> [Interview with Marian Jusko, vice governor of the National </F>
Bank of the Slovak Republic, by Oldrich Zabojnik in Bratislava; 
date not given: "The Slovak Republic Intends To Honor the 
Payments Treaty"] 
  [Text] [Zabojnik] What approach will the National Bank of 
the Slovak Republic [NBS] or, possibly, the Slovak Finance 
Ministry use? Will it regularly cover the clearing margin, or 
have you considered some changes? 
  [Jusko] The NBS intends to honor the payments treaty between 
the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic currently in effect. 
This treaty clearly specifies that margin calls must be covered 
within 15 days. Our national bank intends to act accordingly. 
For the time being, we want to keep the payments treaty in 
effect and operational as long as possible. 
  [Zabojnik] The Czech National Bank [CNB] has several times 
expressed its willingness to abolish the old lot [separate 
record of payments due from the time before the currency 
division]. Does the NBS or the Slovak Finance Ministry (if 
applicable) agree with this? 
  [Jusko] The NBS is just as willing to abolish the old lot as 
the CNB is. I believe that it is in the interest of both banks. 
  [Zabojnik] An extension of the currency exchange-rate margin 
within the framework of the clearing account has been mentioned 
as a possible solution. How do you feel about this proposal? 
  [Jusko] I cannot take a definite stand on this. 
Nevertheless, 
it could result in the creation of two price levels that, on a 
long-term basis, could be unfavorable. In any event, this idea 
would have to be developed. However, I do not expect that the 
Czech side would be interested in extending the exchange-rate 
margin within the framework of the clearing. 
  [Zabojnik] According to the CNB, a substantial part of the 
old lot--and therefore the margin excess--is a result of 
speculation. According to the Czech Finance Ministry, it is not 
so. What do you think? 
  [Jusko] I would like to divide this question into two. The 
first one is whether some speculation payments have taken place 
on the old lot. I believe I can safely claim that certain 
signals indicate that such payments have been made. The second 
part of this question concerns the size of the share of these 
speculations in the margin excess. I believe that the 
speculations are responsible for only a small part of this 
excess because such a speculation has to pass through both lots. 
Therefore, to a great degree, it is compensated. 
  [Zabojnik] According to the Czech Finance Ministry, 
approximately 20 billion korunas in favor of the Czech Republic, 
the amount by which the debts of Slovak enterprises exceed their 
claims in the Czech Republic, are still to pass through the 
clearing process. What are the figures at your disposal? 
  [Jusko] This probably applies to the old lot--that is, 
obligations and claims that arose before 8 February. The amount 
of 20 billion seems to me to be rather high. I was present at 
the signing of the payments treaty. The opinions differed 
regarding the surplus of the Slovak obligations--that is, 
obligations of the Slovak enterprises over the obligations of 
the Czech entities. 
  [Zabojnik] The amalgamation of the two lots is technically 
possible immediately. However, the Finance Ministries of both 
republics must decide on the compensation in the transfer to the 
new exchange rate. What are your plans, and have you discussed 
them with the Czech side? 
  [Jusko] We have talked unofficially about it with the Czech 
side. I have talked with the CNB representatives myself. It is 
not a foregone conclusion that the finance ministries of the two 
republics must solve this problem. A different approach is 
possible provided the consequences of the closing of the old lot 
would be borne by the Czech enterprises. The Slovak enterprises 
should lose nothing by the cancellation of the old lot. 
  [Zabojnik] To what degree is this situation reflected in the 
current financial position of the Slovak Republic? 
  [Jusko] From the point of view of the deficit manifested at 
the end of December, the situation is getting rather dramatic. I 
consider it a very bad approach. Balanced payments or settled 
clearing payments with a single country cannot be the objective 
of any country. It is much more important whether its overall 
payments are balanced, or, more precisely, whether the balance 
of its current account is in the black. A deficit with respect 
to one country is balanced out by a surplus with respect to 
another country. That is how we should perceive the mutual 
relations between the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic. It 
is important that the payments treaty is followed exactly. I 
believe that this treaty proved itself. It is--and it should 
remain--the goal of the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic 
to keep it working as long as possible in the economic relations 
between our countries. 
  [Zabojnik] The total sum of the Slovak clearing deficit 
comes to 6.5 billion Slovak korunas. That is a substantial 
amount for the payment ability of a country that is entering 
this year with such a deficit budget. One may subscribe to your 
opinion that a certain section of the balance of payments of a 
country with any other entity does not necessarily have to tell 
all about the economy of the given state. At the same time, 
however, you admit that the relations between our two states are 
special. What does this mean to you? 
  [Jusko] I dare to say that the interest of the NBS is very 
serious. We see the advantages of the payments treaty that we 
are going to follow to the letter. Regarding the amount of the 
deficit on 31 December 1993, it is true that it amounts to 
approximately 6.5 billion korunas. Thus, the margin excess is 
about 1.5 billion over the margin. Therefore, we will pay the 
CNB 39 million ECU's. These figures, one could say, are not 
favorable, but they do not represent a disaster, either. It 
apparently is a matter conditioned by the historical development 
of two independent economies, where one of them is more 
dependent on the other. After all, the Slovak economy is smaller 
than the Czech one. 
  [Zabojnik] It seems evident that the difference between our 
two countries continues to grow. Do you believe that this also 
applies to the financial relations between the Slovak Republic 
and the Czech Republic? 
  [Jusko] Every central bank should be an independent and 
apolitical institution. Therefore, I do not dare to judge and do 
not even want to take a stand on whether the societies of the 
two countries are drifting apart. The results in the currency 
sphere are quite comparable. Of course, the currently accessible 
results are more favorable for the Czech Republic. In some 
spheres, however, the differences are not major. I have in mind 
the inflation rate, for instance, which is higher in the Slovak 
Republic than in the Czech Republic, although, one can say, the 
values are comparable. Nevertheless, there certainly are areas 
where our results are substantially worse. 
  [Zabojnik] Would you then admit that these results indicate 
certain economic drifting apart, after all? 
  [Jusko] As the federation was divided into two states, a 
certain divergence occurred, which apparently is a necessary 
phenomenon in all spheres of life. Of course, this does not mean 
that it should continue. Eventually, it has to stop. In the 
beginning of the operation of the NBS, we cooperated with the 
CNB much more closely than today. Cooperation continues on a 
very good level. These relations are preserved not only as 
regards the financial institutions but also in the enterprise 
sphere. The enterprises of both states will continue to 
cooperate on the basis of mutual benefit. We must differentiate 
between economic laws that lead to a certain divergence and 
various irrational and, perhaps, politically based approaches 
permeating the economic relations. If disharmonies of this type 
were to occur, it would be very bad, and it certainly would not 
benefit either country.

  [Text] The leadership of the Liberal Democratic Party 
[LDS], the ministers of this party in the government, and the 
deputies in the State Chamber met at a working meeting in Izlake 
today. According to party president Dr. Janez Drnovsek, they 
assessed favorably the work of the party and the government 
coalition so far. They have only agreed that they will try to 
continue the work of the present coalition, and, in connection 
with this, resolve the most vital problems. Our reporter, Manca 
Ocvirk, has interviewed party president Dr. Janez Drnovsek about 
this: 
  [Begin recording] [Ocvirk] Can we expect any changes in the 
government coalition after today's meeting, Mr. Drnovsek? 
  [Drnovsek] Not on the basis of this meeting. On the 
contrary, my assessment is that this meeting will, in a way, 
strengthen the relations within the LDS as well as within the 
coalition. I do not expect any such changes in the long term. 
  [Ocvirk] How long will you wait for the reply of the Social 
Democrats? 
  [Drnovsek] I would not like to set any deadlines, however, I 
expect their positive reply regarding the annex to the coalition 
agreement in the very near future. Namely, this annex is 
supposed to facilitate a more efficient work of the coalition. 
Of course, if they will not extend such a consent and 
signature, a question about the purpose of this party's work in 
the present coalition will arise, as, by this, the party will 
express its interest, that is to say, its lack of interest for 
something like this. However, I expect that they will sign this 
in the shortest possible time. [end recording]

  [Text] Warsaw, 7 Jan -- Sir Leon Brittan, commissioner for 
external economic relations and trade policy of the European 
Communities, ended his visit to Poland in the 7th of this month. 
  Brittan was received at dinner by Premier Waldemar Pawlak. 
He also held talks with members of the Polish Government, 
including Deputy Premier Borowski, Information Minister 
Olechowski, and Privatization Minister Kaczmarek. The main 
subject of these talks was the future of relations between the 
European Union and Poland. The Association Treaty between Poland 
and the EC comes into force on 1 February, and Poland will 
become a fully fledged partner for the states of the Union. 
  The commissioner also signed, in the name of the European 
Union, a financial memorandum relating to assistance in 
implementing a program of promoting and attracting foreign 
investment to Poland called INVESTPROM, financed from PHARE 
[Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] funds at 10 
million ecu [European currency units] over three years. 
  During a press conference at the end of the visit, Brittan 
said, among other things, that Poland is continuing a policy of 
decisive economic reforms. This has in an unavoidable way 
placed great burdens upon society. In addition to granting 
advice, the obligation of the Union is to support the process of 
reforms both by granting substantive assistance and by 
participating in the privatisation of Polish enterprises; also 
Polish access to the markets of the Union should be made 
possible, although this in significant measure depends upon the 
situation in those markets. The Union also expects further 
close cooperation with the Polish Government, stressed Brittan.

Afterward, other people can continue, the president said,

  If any political force tries to hinder settling the foreign 
debt issue, it would be committing an act of national treason, 
the president said. He noted that in his upcoming address to 
the National Assembly, he will stress the necessity of rapidly 
adopting the budget and the bills that are extremely necessary 
for foreign debt negotiations and the IMF agreement. 
  According to the president, it is very important to achieve 
a 
consensus in the parliament on measures needed by the country. 
He would like to see the meeting between Filip Dimitrov and 
Zhan Videnov contribute to this end. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Belgrade, Jan 7 (TANJUG) -- The commander of the 
U.N. troops in ex-Yugoslavia, General Jean Cot lodged a 
complaint with the Croatian authorities over the mistreatment of 
Canadian peacekeepers by the Croatian Army. The UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] communique, conveyed to TANJUG Friday [7 
January], states that on January 5 seven armed Croatian soldiers 
stopped, disarmed and arrested four Canadian peacekeepers who 
were on a routine patrol in the area of Medak, south of the 
republic of Serb Krajina. 
  The communique adds that the patrol commander had shown his 
authorisation to cross the territory which was ignored and the 
Canadian soldiers were forced at gunpoint to go to the local 
Croatian Army headquarters. Describing the incident as 
"shameful" Jean Cot requested of the Croatian authorities to 
conduct an inquiry and punish those responsible. In an action 
named "Scorched Earth" last September the Croatian Army has 
occupied the Medak area, and burnt down 11 Serb villages and 
brutally murdered 72 civilians. The republic of Serb Krajina 
was declared by the Serbs in 1991 in parts of the former 
Republic of Croatia where Serbs are a majority population, in 
defiance of the forced Croatian secession from the former 
Yugoslavia and their downgrading of the Serbs from a constituent 
nation to a national minority. 
  Although the RSK has been under U.N. protection since March 
1992 in that period Croatia has three times attacked the Serb 
state that it does not recognize, with the aim of forcibly 
placing it under its authority.

  [Text] The aggression against the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, an internationally recognized country and UN 
member, has been going on for as long as 21 months. The 
aggression was planned and is being carried out by Serbia and 
Montenegro. Their fascists have so far managed to produce 
evidence that civil war is now at issue here, a letter sent by 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Defense Hamdija Hadzihasanovic to the defense 
ministers of NATO member-countries said. 
  All that the international community is doing is delivering 
humanitarian aid, which helps us survive--until we are killed by 
the aggressor's shells and snipers, though. The belief that the 
war can be contained within the borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina is 
wrong. 
  We shall never give up. We are numerous enough and we are 
determinted to fight to the end. Death is not painful. 
Humiliation is painful. To us the word life implies freedom and 
justice, the Bosnia-Herzegovina defense minister writes in his 
letter. 
  Milosevic can only be stopped by force. Europe and the world 
have this kind of force, Hadzihasanovic writes in his letter to 
the the Defense Ministers 16 NATO member-countries, demanding 
their help in lifting the embargo on importing arms to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] President of the republic of Kosova Dr. Ibrahim 
Rugova held a new conference in Prishtina today. Let us follow 
the telephone report by our correspondent Sherif Konjuca: 
  [Konjuca] We hope that this year will be the year of 
agreements and peace in the Balkans, president of the republic 
of Kosova Dr. Ibrahim Rugova said, acquainting reporters with 
the results of his visit to several Western European countries. 
Mr. Rugova said that all these meetings displayed a great 
concern over the situation in Kosova and, in all the high-level 
talks, the question of Kosova was put forward as an 
international question. We were promised that the international 
community will commit itself to solve the Kosova issue fairly. 
  To avoid the present conflict in Kosova, posing grave 
consequences for the whole region, we asked that Kosova be 
placed under an international protectorate so that life returns 
to normal, democratic institutions be established, and talks 
about Kosova's future be more eased. The visit of the U.S. 
President Bill Clinton to Europe and Russia is a good occasion 
to bring the attitudes for the solution of the problems in 
former Yugoslavia and the Balkans closer. 
  Mr. Rugova said that, unfortunately, the Serbian regime is 
continuing its hard repression against the Albanians in Kosova. 
Also during last week, many homes of Albanians were raided and 
many citizens and political activists were maltreated. The 
attack of the police against the Kosovar sportsmen was 
particularly very primitive. Severe tortures are being used 
against prisoners, while their apprehension is illegally 
prolonged. Lately, groups of Serbian civilians, too, have 
started to attack people in the streets, something that is 
worsening relations between neighbors. 
  Answering a question on the present importance of the Bujan 
conference, Rugova considered this historic meeting as a 
permanent inspiration and a strong support for peacefully 
satisfying the will of the Kosovar people for freedom and 
independence. 
  Answering a question by a correspondent as to how long this 
situation in Kosova will last and how long the people will 
support his peaceful option, Mr. Rugova answered that the people 
understand that the other road [the non-peaceful option] will be 
very tragic for Kosova, because we are completely unprotected 
here. He said that our movement is developing on the basis of 
the people's consciousness and the situation we are undergoing. 
However, we consider the criticisms about our road to be normal. 
  Mr. Rugova denounced articles in the Serbian mass media on 
the alleged commitment of hundreds of Albanian fighters in the 
ranks of Muslims in the world, which aim to compromise our 
peaceful movement. The truth is that in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
[words indistinct] 200,000 Albanians live, whereas only in 
Trajeve, about 100 unprotected Albanians were killed and 
massacred. A total of 200 others are still detained in the 
university, and, despite our persistence, they are not allowed 
to go out as the others have.

<F P=106> [From BTA press review] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, January 8 (BTA) -- The dailies frontpage 
comments on the reaction of different officials and institutions 
to yesterday's reports in some newspapers, according to which 
President Zhelyu Zhelev issued an express decree and a letter, 
allegedly intending to take over direct command of the Bulgarian 
Army. The Socialists' DUMA writes that Chief of General Staff 
Army General Lyuben Petrov took a "sharp and firm" stand against 
the powers vested under the letter to the Ministry of Defence 
and the General Staff in the chief of the president's military 
office and his advisors to supervise the General Staff and have 
access to operational information even over the head of the 
General Staff. According to unnamed former military, the 
document suggested an attempt to shape the military office as a 
supervisory body with respect to the Defence Ministry, the 
General Staff and the Army as a whole, the newspaper adds. , 
  OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK quotes a "well-informed source in the 
office of the president" as alleging that the media attack 
against Dr. Zhelev is the latest in a series of machinations by 
General Stoyan Andreev, Dr. Zhelev's former national security 
advisor. The fuss may have originated from the BSP [Bulgarian 
Socialist Party] headquarters and was intended as a blow at the 
president, according to "knowledgeable" sources quoted in the 
trade union daily PODKREPA. 
  "Socialists, Zhelev conspired in gaffe of 
president-requested 
powers for military office. General Lyuben Petrov knew about 
bid to parallel General Staff, but denies it. Presidential 
advisors expected to resign," reads the heading of the story in 
DEMOKRATSIYA, the daily of the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS). 
24 CHASA headlines its coverage "Parliament at War With 
Zhelev." "The (anti- communist) SDS will probably side with the 
(ex-communist) Bulgarian Socialist Party against Zhelev," the 
daily writes editorially. 
  The president's decree and letter occasioned the meeting 
between SDS leader Filip Dimitrov and BSP Chairman Zhan Videnov 
a couple of days ago, Mr. Videnov admits in an interview for 
KONTINENT. "Politicians, experts say documents on president's 
military office are unconstitutional," runs the headline of 
another story in the same daily. "This is the latest attempt to 
destabilize the situation in the country," says the chief of the 
president's military office General Stefan Dimitrov, interviewed 
for 24 CHASA. He denied that the military office is assigned 
directive functions with respect to the Army. "The legislative 
vacuum in the laws on the Armed Forces gives rise to a confusion 
as to who is subordinated to whom," STANDART NEWS observes. "I 
admit that I was over- credulous and, together with General 
Petrov, I signed a directive to the commanders to assist the 
implementation of the president's letter," Defence Minister 
Valentin Aleksandrov is quoted as saying in TRUD. "How will the 
president of the republic get out of the mess in which he was 
involved by his military advisors?" asks TRUD in an editorial 
commentary.

  [Text] Sofia, January 8 (BTA) -- Yesterday's press 
allegations that President Zhelev was planning to assume direct 
control of the Bulgarian Army are absurd, according to Mr. 
Plamen Bogoev, adviser to the president on legal matters, who 
appeared on national television this evening in the news and 
views show "Panorama." Mr. Bogoev sees two possible ways to 
resolve the scandal. One way is to invoke the effective 
legislation and above all the Constitution. To this end, at 
least one-quarter of the total number of MP's should move to 
impeach the president. To be carried, such a motion requires 
the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the national 
representatives. The Constitutional Court will then be asked to 
rule whether the head of state had violated the Constitution, 
the presidential adviser noted. The second way is to resolve 
the current conflict by the "fade-out method," of which there is 
a strong probability, Mr. Bogoev said. If the National Assembly 
Committee on National Security takes up the matter, things will 
by all means take a fade-out course because the committee does 
not have the competence of the Constitutional Court and will 
wait for the scandal to subside. This is convenient because, 
without a settlement in substance, the matter could always be 
brought up again, the president's adviser observed. He 
explained that Dr. Zhelev's decree regulated the internal rules 
of procedure of the office of the president.

  [Text] Sofia, January 6 (BTA) -- "The first truck convoys 
carrying Bulgarian goods to Hungary across Serbia may start by 
the end of January," Bulgarian Transport Minister Kiril Ermenkov 
said, speaking to reporters at the government Press Office on 
his arrival from Belgrade this morning. On January 4-5 he had 
talks there with Serbia's Minister of Transport Zarko Katic, 
Yugoslavia's Minister of Transport Blagoje Lucic and Serbia's 
Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic. They agreed on the 
technicalities concerning the transit carriage by road of 
Bulgarian goods across Serbia which was allowed by the UN 
Sanctions Committee in late November 1993. 
  "We discussed the details of organization and the conditions 
for transit transportation and the necessity of monitors and 
people escorting the trucks," Mr. Ermenkov said. Bulgarian 
goods will be carried only in convoys of ten to fifteen sealed 
trucks, and up to two convoys a day will be allowed to transit 
Serbia. There will be an escort in each trucks, and trucks will 
be weighed on crossing into Serbia and on arrival in Hungary. 
The border check points of entry and exit will be notified 
electronically. 
  Only goods allowed by the UN Sanctions Committee will be 
carried: Meat and meat preparations, agricultural produce and 
medicines. Serbia will charge 50 percent of the road and highway 
tolls specified in the bilateral agreement for the transit 
traffic. This percentage may be reduced further, as both 
countries wish to increase the traffic across Serbia, the 
minister of transport said. 
  Serbia was given a list of the monitors, employed by the 
state-owned road hauler So Mat. Representatives of the Union of 
Private Carriers and the State Automobile Inspectorate will be 
added to the list in the coming days. 
  A resumption of rail transportation through Yugoslavia was 
also on the agenda, Mr. Ermenkov said. 
  Mr. Ermenkov would not commit himself to predictions about 
the effect of the special corridor on the Bulgarian economy. He 
does not doubt, however, that the losses caused by the embargo 
against Serbia and Montenegro will be decreased.

  [Text] Prague Jan 6 (CTK) -- There is no reason for a 
coordinated strategy of the Visegrad Four countries (the Czech 
Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland) regarding their 
relations to NATO, Czech Defence Minister Antonin Baudys told 
journalists today. He was reacting to the question whether his 
absence from the Warsaw meeting of the Visegrad defence 
ministers, planned for Friday [7 January], was connected with 
any statements on the agenda of the meeting. 
  Secretary of State to the Slovak Defence Ministry Ivo Urban 
said on Wednesday [5 January] that the defence ministers' 
meeting should coordinate the joint approach to the admission in 
NATO and the joint strategy before its forthcoming meeting. 
  "I refused to attend the first planned meeting already as I 
did not deem it purposeful to work on a joint strategy of the 
Visegrad Four regarding their relations with NATO," Baudys said. 
"The formulation about the joint strategy towards NATO 
countries is very unclear for us," he said. 
  Baudys added that if the Warsaw meeting were to be devoted 
to 
the issue again, he believes that the first deputy minister of 
defence is skilled and informed enough to be able to present the 
views of the ministry. "We do not want to create any new 
groupings," Baudys said.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 6 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic would like 
to take the question of its integration with NATO out of the 
"excessively structuralised and insitutionalised Visegrad 
process, Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec told journalists 
today. [no closing quotation mark as received] 
  At the same time Zieleniec stressed that there were many 
questions of mutual interest in the Central European region 
which should be solved within the Visegrad Four group (the Czech 
Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary). These were the questions 
directly connected with life in the area, economic cooperation 
and cooperation in the building of the region's infrastructure 
as well as "several political problems," he said. 
  On the other hand, however, the philosophy of the 
transformation of Czech society is characterised by "relying on 
its own strength," Zieleniec said. He said he did not consider 
it appropriate to unnecessarily emphasise the exclusiveness of 
the Visegrad group. The exclusion of other countries from the 
European integration processes was not in the interests of Czech 
foreign policy, he said.

  [Text] Prague Jan 7 (CTK) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton 
will devote the first day of his two-day visit to Prague January 
11-12 to meetings with Czech President Vaclav Havel, Premier 
Vaclav Klaus and, according to unofficial reports, to a walk 
across the Charles Bridge and a visit to some Old Town sites. 
  After his arrival, which is expected at around 4:00 PM [1500 
GMT], Clinton is to go to Prague Castle where, after a welcoming 
ceremony, he will meet with Havel in the Brozik Hall. They will 
later be joined by Klaus, likely after moving into the Hall of 
Mirrors. 
  According to the original programme, Clinton is to begin his 
visit to the Old Town at 6:30 PM. There he wants to take a walk 
across the Charles Bridge and possibly stop into a typical 
Prague pub. Clinton is to spend the night at the Hotel Atrium, 
but there is also speculation that he might stay at the 
presidential apartment in Prague Castle. 
  On Wednesday morning, the president is to tour the Jewish 
Cemetery and meet individually with the presidents of the other 
Visegrad Group countries -- Arpad Goncz of Hungary, Lech Walesa 
of Poland and Michal Kovac of Slovakia. The meetings are to be 
held at the U.S. ambassador's residence and culminate with a 
joint briefing. A working lunch is planned for Clinton and the 
Visegrad presidents. 
  Before 3:00 PM, Clinton is to visit the Kmart-Maj department 
store for a discussion on Czech-American trade and business 
activities, which Klaus is also to attend. Clinton is then to 
have 15 minutes of "private time" as part of the Kmart visit. 
Afterwards he will head for the airport, where he is to spend 
an hour meeting with U.S. embassy employees. At 5:30 PM he will 
depart for Moscow. 
  According to some reports from American sources, original 
plans for an "entertainment programme" will probably be cut back 
due to the Thursday [6 January] death of Clinton's mother. He 
was originally to visit the Na Zabradli Theatre, the U Zlateho 
Tygra pub and the Reduta Jazz Club on Tuesday evening. Clinton 
may go jogging on Wednesday morning. 
  Official spokespersons for both the American and Czech sides 
say that the programme has not yet been definitively set down.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 6 (CTK) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton's third foreign visit since taking office, due to take 
place in the next few days, testifies to the place Central 
Europe and the whole European continent occupies in U.S. foreign 
policy, Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec told a press 
conference today. 
  In connection with the death of Clinton's mother today, 
Zieleniec expressed hope that the programme of Clinton's stay in 
the Czech Republic would turn out well, although minor and even 
basic changes could be expected. 
  Regarding Polish and Hungarian criticism of the arrangement 
whereby the meetings between Clinton and leaders of the Visegrad 
countries (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland) would 
be bilateral rather than taking the form of a Visegrad Four 
meeting, Zieleniec said that the programme had been made 
according to the American side's wish to hold a regional meeting 
in Prague. He said the programme was being intensively 
discussed with all the participants. It is natural as the 
meeting is being held in Prague that Clinton's talks will have 
both bilateral and multilateral aspects, Zieleniec said. 
  It is not expected that Clinton will deliver an extensive 
speech on the occasion -- the debate would rather concentrate on 
particular problems, Zieleniec said. Nor is it expected that a 
joint document will be signed. The visit and the discussions 
will be extremely important not only for the security of the 
Central European region but for the whole of Europe and the 
world, Zieleniec said. 
  He said Central Europe was also participating in the search 
for a new face for the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) 
which had lost the form it originally had in a bipolar world. 
For the Czech Republic, membership in NATO as in other 
integrated groups was a question of historic, civilisation and 
cultural identity rather than a question of resolving concrete 
problems, Zieleniec said. He said the Czech Republic's efforts 
to obtain NATO membership were not in competition with other 
countries. 
  The U.S. Partnership for Peace project was important because 
it opens up space for initiative rather than defining particular 
form of relations. Although the Czech Republic welcomes it, 
this does not mean that it considers it an ideal solution, 
Zieleniec said. The openness of this project would enable each 
country to individually develop relevant activity according to 
its possibilities and needs. "It is a project which fits the 
general philosophy of our approach towards the transformation of 
our state," Zieleniec said. 
  He said that the project's political dimention should be 
more 
clearly defined so that it was not merely confined to joint 
military exercises, exchanges of military experts and so forth 
but also included political criteria. NATO faces the task of 
gradual transformation into an alliance concentrating on certain 
civilised values, which requires extremely intensive political 
activity within nato as well as activity aimed at its expansion, 
Zieleniec said.

  [Text] Prague Jan 7 (CTK) -- An assembly to protest U.S. 
President Bill Clinton's upcoming visit to Prague is being 
planned by local anarchists for January 11 on Old Town Square, 
said Jakub Polak, editor-in-chief of the magazine A-KONTRA, at a 
press conference of the Left Alternative and the Czechoslovak 
Anarchist Association today. 
  In addition to the assembly, Polak said, a series of other 
demonstrations, manifestations and protests are being prepared. 
Polak would not specify any times or locations "so they will not 
be prevented." 
  Polak called Clinton the representative of a country "that 
is 
not qualified to be a parliament of human rights and that does 
not have the right to talk about peace." The President himself 
"awakens false hopes" and his policies "postpone necessary 
changes," Polak said. 
  Prague Police Spokesman Petr Link told CTK today that the 
police had not been notified of any demonstrations in connection 
with Clinton's visit.

  [Text] Karvina, North Moravia Jan 6 (CTK) -- Czech 
Parliament Chairman Milan Uhde today said that the life of the 
Polish and Slovak minorities in the Karvina area is not 
accompanied by any "aching problems that would require an 
immediate solution." 
  At a press conference at the close of his two-day working 
visit to North Moravia and Silesia, Uhde said he had very good 
feelings from his meeting today with teachers from a Karvina 
basic school where Slovak is a teaching language. He said he 
saw no reasons for keeping its existence secret. 
  However, he said the existence of this school, the only one 
in the Czech Republic, will not lead parliament to start 
considering the expansion of this sort of school into other 
cities in the republic. 
  Uhde described his talks with members of the Polish council 
in Cesky Tesin, which represents the interests of more than 
50,000 ethnic Poles living in the Czech Republic, as 
stimulating. In the Karvina area alone there are currently 
about 23,350 citizens claiming to be of Polish origin and 23,550 
citizens describing themselves as ethnic Slovaks. 
  Asked about a possible return of property confiscated from 
the ethnic Poles under the communist regime (toppled in 
Czechoslovakia in November 1989), Uhde said that it is 
impossible to extend the date further back beyond February 1948 
(when the communists seized power in the former Czechoslovakia). 
He recalled that the property was confiscated not only after 
1945 but also before and in the course of the Second World War.

  [Text] Prague Jan 6 (CTK) -- Czech Defence Minister 
Antonin Baudys today said that further cuts in the Czech Army 
will probably be halted in the near future and that it is 
possible that the role of the Army will grow again. 
  At a press conference, he said this would depend on 
developments in the former Yugoslavia and in southern areas of 
the former Soviet Union as well as on what the political and 
economic consequences of the first democratic elections in 
Russia would be and how they would be reflected in concrete 
steps, given the economic and political stabilisation of the 
country. 
  Baudys said that the reduction of military forces is a 
historical process currently underway in Europe as a result of 
the break-up of the bipolar world. He said it was a natural 
response by certain states but not all of them. In this context 
he mentioned Sweden, which is increasing its army budget, and 
Austria, which is strengthening its anti-aircraft defence. 
  Baudys said that, in his opinion, there should be no cuts in 
the army in future, but rather that its effectiveness should 
increase. Therefore, it is necessary to build effective systems 
of management and command and effective defence systems. But 
this is rather expensive, and "we must take into consideration 
what our budget is," he concluded.

  [Text] London, 7 January (MTI) -- In many respects, 
Hungary is today much closer to NATO than it was one year ago, 
Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky said in an interview 
with the BBC's Hungarian service on Thursday [6 January]. 
  Discussing the forthcoming Prague meeting, Jeszenszky said 
the main aim of the talks is for the new American Administration 
to be familiarized with the views of Central Europe, and for 
Washington to acknowledge that the road to Moscow leads through 
Central Europe. 
  The Prague talks should, according to the foreign minister, 
also focus on the steps that could best promote the survival, or 
intensification of the favorable, democratic processes in Russia. 
  As regards the expansion of NATO, Jeszenszky again stressed 
that opening the organization towards the East would not 
strengthen the conservative forces in Russia. "In my view, the 
contrary of this is true: Expanding NATO is a Russian interest 
as well," he said. 
  Jeszenszky said he does not agree with the position whereby 
the American "Partnership for Peace" proposal conceals the 
intention of delivering Central-Eastern Europe into the hands of 
the Russians. "I consider the existence of such a Western 
intention to be completely out of the question, nor do I believe 
that the American proposal, or any other Western policy, would 
result in this," Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky said.

  [Text] Budapest, January 7 (MTI) -- Protesters on Friday 
from Hungary's Alba Circle/Violence-Free Movement for Peace, put 
a symbolic barrier saying "Exit 10 DM [German marks], outside 
the Yugoslav Embassy. 
  They claim the Yugoslav Government's decision to make 
outgoing citizens pay a personal duty of ten German marks and a 
car duty of thirty German marks from January 1, violates the UN 
Human Rights Declaration and the Yugoslav Constitution. They 
believe the measure is in part cynically designed to deprive 
ethnic Hungarians in the Yugoslav region of Vojvodina of the 
link with their parent country they need to preserve their 
national identity. 
  The movement's petition was not accepted by embassy staff, 
but was read out by executives Pal Gyorgy Gado and Istvan Farkas. 
  Free passage through the border means survival for many 
Yugoslav citizens in the economic crisis caused by the UN 
sanctions, as many basic food products, agricultural fuels, and 
medicines are only available abroad. However, most people are 
unable to pay the 10 and 30 DM duties, reads the statement.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 6 -- Russia is dictating terms to NATO 
and to the West, and if we want to ask about (NATO membership), 
we should ask Boris Yeltsin, because he is really running NATO 
and the West, President Lech Walesa said on Thursday. 
  Speaking in an interview for the ITN television news 
network, 
Germany's ARD, and the UPI press agency, President Walesa 
claimed that in failing to admit former communist countries into 
the European communities, "the West betrays itself, and has 
scored an own goal." The West has achieved nothing since the 
fall of communism, he asserted. 
  Walesa was critical of the U.S. "partnership for peace" 
proposals. "We cannot talk about partnership, since there is no 
partnership visible yet. There is Russia, which threatens the 
West, which is frightened, and us in the middle, saying there is 
no need to be afraid, all you must do is to increase, 
physically, technically, the resources of Western Europe," he 
said. 
  "We have got by, we will get by, and we face no threat. 
Russia is not about to invade Poland -- it is too small a 
matter for Russia. If the dangers of which the West speaks 
exist, then they threaten, not Poland, but Europe," President 
Walesa said.

  [Text] Warsaw, 7 Jan -- President Lech Walesa today 
received Ambassador Madeleine Albright, President Bill Clinton's 
special envoy. Her mission is connected with the program of 
"Partnership for Peace" put forward by the United States. 
  Underscoring U.S. merits in building democracy in Europe, 
President Walesa said that, in his view as a former soldier, one 
has to use favorable moments and apply a "lead forward tactic." 
"I am of the opinion that there is a chance today for a leap 
ahead in Europe," the president said. He added that, while 
recognizing U.S. responsibility for the world, "we do not want 
to hinder great ideas, but we want to present our stand." 
  Among members of the U.S. delegation is General John 
Shalikashvili, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the U.S. 
armed forces.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 8 -- Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak 
told journalists of the regional press during a meeting in 
Warsaw on Saturday that U.S. President Bill Clinton's initiative 
"Partnership for Peace" was indefinite and only the name of the 
program was known. 
  Pawlak added that talks with President Clinton's envoy 
Madeleine Albright on Friday did not result in a declaration 
that the "Partnership for Peace" program would lead to NATO 
membership. According to the prime minister, these are only 
mechanisms enabling Poland to maintain direct military contacts 
for which this country will have to pay. These contacts will 
not function in case of a threat. 
  Pawlak told journalists he had discussed the American 
proposal with Russian Ambassador to Poland Yuriy Kashlev on 
Friday. He said the cabinet would adopt an official stand of 
the Polish Government on this question before the summit of the 
Visegrad group in Prague and talks with President Clinton and 
would do this at the nearest session of the council of ministers 
with the participation of President Lech Walesa and chairmen of 
the Sejm and senate foreign policy committees.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 6 -- Maciej Ilowiecki, chairman of the 
Council for Mass Media attached to the presidential office, said 
on Thursday that a practicing journalist or a theoretician 
should be appointed presidential adviser for mass media rather 
than Janusz Zaorski who did not meet these requirements. Walesa 
appointed Zaorski, former head of the State Radio and 
television, to the post on Wednesday. 
  Ilowiecki, who is deputy chairman of the Radio and TV 
Council 
(KRRIT), was asked to comment on the matter during a press 
conference of the council. The president's press office 
announced Wednesday that Zaorski would fulfill his function 
gratuitously.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 6 -- Leaders of the Conservative Party 
(PK) on Thursday accused the Waldemar Pawlak government of 
pursuing a centralist, anti-local government policy, increased 
fiscalism and maintaining an ineffective system of social 
insurances. 
  Speaking at a press conference in Warsaw, Aleksander Hall 
said that the decision of the majority of communes to delay the 
date of taking control over primary schools was the result of 
centralist policy of the government coalition. According to 
Hall, the left-wing groupings halted the process of 
decentralisation and weakened the prestige of local authorities. 
Hall announced that the PK would take steps to create 
anti-socialist coalitions during the forthcoming local 
government elections. 
  Pawel Zalewski strongly criticised the draft budget for 1994 
for what he termed as excessive fiscalism and the upholding of 
ineffective system of social security and insurances as well as 
the failure to reform the public sector. 
  According to Zalewski, the draft budget for 1994 
demonstrates 
that the "coalition has no will nor concept of reforming the 
insurance system and the public sector, while its shortsighted 
policy is designed to help the coalition to remain in power."

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 6 (CTK) -- According to official 
statements, Slovakia is striving to join NATO and the European 
Union (EU) as quickly as possible and considers a joint approach 
by the Visegrad Four countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Poland and Slovakia) to be the easiest of all. 
  Bratislava has reacted very sensitively to signs of 
"discrimination" within the Visegrad Group. It has not 
responded positively to the reserved stance of Czech politicians 
towards the Visegrad Group, or to efforts at taking an 
individual approach to the West. The Slovak Foreign Ministry 
has been stressing the multilateral character of the envisaged 
meeting of the Visegrad countries' top representatives with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton, which is to be held in Prague on January 
11-12. 
  By its recent approval of Slovakia's association with the 
EU, 
the Slovak parliament seems to have clearly expressed its 
support of the strategic goal of attaining full membership in 
the EU and other West European structures, including NATO. 
  However, more exact conclusions on a consensus of Slovak 
political parties regarding the goals of Slovak foreign policy 
can probably be drawn only after the debate on the speech of 
Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik, slated for January. 
  Slovakia did not reject the U.S. initiative "Partnership for 
Peace," but at the same time indicated that the initiative did 
not fully correspond to its idea of joining NATO. 
  "We understand (the initiative) as a certain temporary phase 
which will eventually lead to our full membership," Moravcik 
told the government daily REPUBLIKA. At a press conference 
after his recent visit to Germany, he praised the "Partnership 
for Peace" as a sign of the differentiated approach to the East 
and Central European applicants for cooperation with NATO, which 
gives priority to the Visegrad countries. Moravcik rejected any 
attempts to discriminate against Slovakia within the Visegrad 
Group. At the same time he said he hoped the NATO countries' 
stands would be more accommodating, also in view of the results 
of the Russian parliamentary elections. 
  In an interview with the U.S. daily THE WASHINGTON POST, 
Slovak President Michal Kovac said he intended to present his 
own plan for acceleration of the Visegrad countries' joining 
NATO. Kovac's spokesman, Anton Bodis, added that the proposal 
was not to be a counter-proposal to the "Partnership for Peace," 
but a possible alternative. 
  "President Kovac welcomes the U.S. project... the Slovak 
Republic unambiguously sticks to this initiative and wants to 
participate actively in it, however, it sees the real and 
definitive solution in full-fledged NATO membership," Bodis told 
CTK. 
  "The president has an idea of quicker integration of 
Slovakia 
and other Central European countries into NATO. The first step 
would be their admission to NATO as political members along with 
offering them security guarantees. After fullfiling the 
obligations to follow from this, the Visegrad countries could 
become full members of the NATO military organisation as well," 
Bodis explained. He added that full integration into the NATO 
military complex demanded a certain amount of time and the 
compatibility of the relevant military systems to NATO standards. 
  He quoted Kovac as saying that in the process of joining 
NATO, the Visegrad Four countries should be considered a 
regional whole, which necessitates these states' greater mutual 
cooperation. "He, Kovac, does not believe that the Visegrad 
countries' individual admission to NATO, at intervals of several 
years, would help improve the stability of Central Europe," 
Bodis said. 
  However, even the stand of Slovakia's government camp on 
NATO 
is not united. In late November 1993, the government daily 
REPUBLIKA cast doubts on the statements of Slovak politicians 
regarding the necessity for Slovakia to join NATO, as well as on 
their efforts to do so along with Slovakia's Visegrad partners. 
"In no way can Slovakia's striving to join big politics through 
a group that is not favourable to us, and in which every member 
country pursues only its own interests, be considered a success 
for Slovak foreign policy," REPUBLIKA wrote, referring to Czech 
politicians' reserved stance towards the Visegrad Group. 
  However, it is not ruled out that such criticism of Slovak 
foreign policy stems more from the internal situation in the 
country's governing Movement For a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), 
especially given Moravcik's (HZDS) recent reservations about the 
policies of HZDS Chairman and Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar. 
  REPUBLIKA quoted Moravcik as saying that so far, no signs 
had 
emerged within the Visegrad Group or NATO regarding whether the 
Visegrad countries should join NATO jointly or separately. 
However, he added that the cooperation between the Visegrad 
Four would be more acceptable for both NATO and the EU, and "our 
countries might be admitted at about the same time." 
  The present situation in Slovak-Hungarian relations seems to 
have caused another slow-down of the cooperation within 
Visegrad. Rudolf Chmel, the last Czechoslovak ambassador to 
Hungary, said these relations destabilised the situation in the 
whole region. 
  Both Hungary and Slovakia have not yet concluded any 
inter-state treaty, which should, according to Bratislava, 
include the confirmation of the two countries' present borders, 
so that Bratislava's often voiced fears of a "Greater Hungary" 
could be dismissed. Hungary has made the treaty conditional on 
the conclusion of a bilateral agreement on the status of the 
Hungarian minority in Slovakia. Bratislava refuses to accept 
this, fearing possible separation tendencies on the part of the 
minority. The question of the Gabcikovo waterworks on the 
Danube River also remains an open problem, which is burdening 
mutual relations. The dispute over the opening of new 
Slovak-Hungarian border crossings, which Bratislava has made 
conditional on Budapest's approval of the readmission agreement 
on returning immigrants, led to the postponement of Hungarian 
Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky's planned visit to Slovakia. 
  Peter Weiss, leader of Slovakia's strongest opposition 
party, 
the Democratic Left Party (SDL) said that the settlement of 
Slovak- Hungarian relations was the basic condition for the 
country's NATO membership, as "NATO will not admit neighbours 
who are at odds with each other." 
  It seems that further development of Hungarian-Slovak 
relations depends to a large extent on the result of the 
forthcoming parliamentary elections in Hungary. However, the 
present tension over the Hungarian minority's claims to 
participate in the administration of southern Slovakia does not 
indicate either any prospect of a prompt settlement of the 
disputes or normalisation of relations between Bratislava and 
Budapest.

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 5 (CTK) -- "Slovak President Michal 
Kovac welcomes the American proposal for a Partnership for 
Peace. The Slovak Republic unambiguously favours this initiative 
and wants to be an active participant in it, but sees NATO 
membership as the real and permanent solution," Slovak 
Presidential Spokesman Anton Bodis told CTK today. 
  Bodis described Kovac's interview with THE WASHINGTON POST, 
saying, "the president did not formulate his idea of NATO 
membership for Visegrad Group countries -- the Czech Republic, 
Slovakia, Hungary and Poland -- as a "counter offer," but rather 
as a possible alternative to the American initiative. 
  "The president can imagine a much faster admission of 
Slovakia and the other Central European countries into NATO," 
Bodis said. "The first step would be their acceptance into NATO 
as political members, together with the granting of security 
guarantees. The Visegrad countries would then be required to 
become full members of the NATO military organisation as well," 
he said. 
  Kovac is an advocate of the view that the Visegrad Group 
countries should be considered a regional whole in the NATO 
membership process, which, he said, would require active mutual 
cooperation. Bodis said that Kovac did not believe that the 
individual admission of Visegrad countries, separated by gaps of 
several years, would aid stability in Central Europe. 
  Bodis added that Kovac intended to discuss the problems of 
the Partnership for Peace during the Prague summit meeting with 
American President Clinton next week.

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 7 (CTK) -- Today's meeting of 
defence ministers of Poland, Slovakia and Hungary and the Czech 
Republic's first deputy defence minister, held before U.S. 
President Bill Clinton's summit meeting with Visegrad countries' 
representatives in Prague, was very useful, Slovak Defence 
Minister Imrich Andrejcak said today. 
  Speaking to journalists upon his return from Warsaw, 
Andrejcak said that U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations 
Madeleine Albright and Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of 
Staff John Shalikashvili left the meeting convinced that "it was 
important and advantageous" for them to support cooperation with 
the Visegrad Four (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and 
Poland). The Slovak Republic supports cooperation aimed at 
ensuring better security and prosperity, Andrejcak said. 
  He said so-called "contact groups" would be established 
after 
Clinton's Prague visit to study possibilities and ways for 
further cooperation. The next meeting of Visegrad defence 
ministers will be held in Bratislava, he added. 
  He said Czech Defence Minister Antonin Baudys's absence from 
the meeting would not hamper cooperation within the Visegrad 
Group, adding that the deputy Czech defence minister, on behalf 
of the Czech Republic, voiced apprehensions over the possibility 
of the institutionalisation of the Visegrad Group that, 
Andrejcak said, was not being considered by anyone. 
  The participants in the Warsaw meeting discussed the 
American 
Partnership for Peace initiative, which offers them closer 
military links with NATO.

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 5 (CTK) -- Minister of Transport, 
Communications and Public Works Roman Hofbauer today declined to 
comment on whether Slovakia would insist on Radio Free Europe 
[RFE] ending its broadcasts January 31. 
  Last month Hofbauer decided to cancel a 1990 agreement 
between RFE and Czechoslovakia which granted the station the 
right to broadcast on a medium wavelength until 1996. As a 
legal successor to Czechoslovakia, the Slovak Republic is bound 
by the agreement. 
  Asked for a response to a U.S. State Department spokesman 
who 
said America hoped Slovakia would reverse its decision, Hofbauer 
said he was unaware of any such statement. 
  Talks between Slovakia and RFE on continuing broadcasts, 
possibly on a shortwave frequency, are scheduled for January 20.

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 5 (CTK) -- The strategy of the 
leaders of Hungarian minority parties in Slovakia is unambiguous 
and will create an atmosphere of mistrust, intolerance and 
hatred among citizens, Slovak Parliament Deputy Chairman 
Augustin Marian Huska said at today's meeting of the coalition 
Movement For a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and Slovak National 
Party (SNS). 
  "Dreams of a greater, or even of a `middle-sized' Hungary 
cannot be fulfilled," Huska said, adding that it was not 
possible for the government not to have contingency plans in 
case the state should be threatened. He expressed the 
conviction that Slovakia would be able to preserve its 
territorial integrity. 
  Slovak Minister of Culture Dusan Slobodnik said that "there 
is no government more tolerant than the current Slovak one." 
Slovak Deputy Premier Sergej Kozlik called on Slovaks to 
express their dissatisfaction over attempts by the Hungarian 
minority to achieve autonomy in southern Slovakia. 
  "It is time for parliament to consider passing a law on the 
protection of the Republic," Slobodnik said, adding that among 
the Hungarian minority there were still "many decent people who 
want to live peacefully in Slovakia." 
  The worsening of the situation in Slovakia is tied to a 
demand made by the Association of Towns and Villages of Zitny 
Island, which is calling for autonomy for southern Slovakia from 
Bratislava to the Ukrainian border. An assembly to discuss the 
demand is to be held on January 8 in Komarno, southern Slovakia.

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 7 (CTK) -- Slovak President Michal 
Kovac, in his statement on the problem of ethnic minorities in 
Slovakia published in the independent daily SME today, stressed 
that it was in the interest of Slovaks, ethnic Hungarians and 
other nationalities and ethnic groups in Slovakia to seek to 
prevent irresponsible politicians from southern Slovakia from 
artificially creating a conflict situation. 
  Kovac's statement calls for dialogue and rejects the 
expressions of nationalism that appeared in a Hungarian-language 
daily on the eve of a meeting of representatives of the 
Hungarian minority in Komarno convened by the Association of 
Towns and Villages of Zitny Island. 
  Although Kovac resolutely rejected as unconstitutional a 
proposal to create a special province in southern Slovakia, at 
the same time he supported as justified demand that the new 
territorial administrative division of Slovakia not discriminate 
against the Hungarian minority.

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 5 (CTK) -- A public rally of several 
hundred citizens of the southern Slovak town of Komarno, 
convened by the Slovak cultural organisation Matica Slovenska in 
its Komarno House today, supported a petition drive for the 
resignation of Komarno Mayor Isztvan Pasztor, a leader of the 
Hungarian minority in southern Slovakia. 
  Pasztor is a chairman of the Council of the Association of 
Towns and Villages of Zitny Island, which has called a meeting 
of deputies and mayors from southern Slovakia designed to 
establish a Hungarian "region with special legal status" in the 
area populated mostly by ethnic Hungarians. 
  Yesterday, a group of Komarno citizens started a petition 
drive for the dismissal of Pasztor, putting up petitions at many 
places in the town. Zdenka Anettova, director of the Komarno 
Matica Slovenska House, told CTK that about 2,000 citizens have 
already signed the petitions, while some 5,000 people are 
required for the mayor to be dismissed. 
  A resolution adopted by the public rally condemned the 
Komarno meeting scheduled for this Saturday [8 January], 
describing it as the "first frank move towards the violation of 
the Slovak Republic's integrity, with the final aim being to 
join Slovakia to Greater Hungary." 
  At the same time, participants appealed to Slovak President 
Michal Kovac to initiate a change in the law on elections to 
local offices. The amended law should guarantee citizens of 
Slovak nationality the right to participate in administration of 
all towns and villages in the Slovak Republic, including in the 
regions where they are the minority. 
  They also called on the Slovak Government to rapidly work 
out 
a "concept of a definitive solution to ethnic minority problems" 
and to submit it to the Council of Europe as a proposal for a 
European norm on the national minority position.

  [Text] Budapest Jan 7 (CTK) -- The participants in the 
Komarno meeting want to formulate joint positions on what they 
"claim by the legal and parliamentary way" with respect to the 
protection of ethnic minorities, Istvan Pasztor, mayor of 
Komarno, South Slovakia, tells today's issue of the Hungarian 
paper PESTI HIRLAP. 
  On January 8, the Association of Towns and Villages of Zitny 
Ostrov (ZMOZO) convenes a meeting which is allegedly to 
establish a province or an area with special status in southern 
Slovakia populated mostly by the Hungarian minority. Pasztor has 
reportedly initiated the meeting which will be held in Komarno, 
the largest Hungarian-speaking city in Slovakia. 
  He tells the paper that the planned administrative set-up of 
Slovakia, which, according to him, would be disadvantageous for 
ethnic Hungarians, is considered the main problem. Another 
problem is that the Slovak legislation provides the local 
government few powers. It would be necessary to strengthen 
their positions by delegating the decision-making to the local 
government, not to government. 
  According to Pasztor, the campaign and attacks against the 
ZMOZO meeting is, in fact, a maneuver to divert attention from 
much more important problems of the Slovak society such as 
disastrous state budget. "At any rate, there are gigantic 
internal conflicts in the Slovak political life over who are the 
better Slovaks. It is claimed that it is those who can best 
defend the nation against enemies. For this, however, it is 
necessary first to create the enemy," he stressed. 
  Pasztor also commented on the attempts by the local 
activists 
of Matica Slovenska (Slovak cultural organisation) to sack him. 
About 2,000 citizens have already signed the petition, while 
some 5,000 people are required for the mayor to be dismissed. 
  Citizens have a right to demand his dismissal, but the 
current campaign is just an evidence of the political 
shortsightedness of the organisers. "They believe that if I am 
no more the mayor, there will be no problems. And that is an 
error," claims Pasztor.

  [Text] Bratislava January 7 (CTK) -- Contrary to 
information which appeared recently in the Slovak press, the 
creation of a hundred-member senate of representatives of the 
Hungarian minority in Slovakia is not at present legally 
justified, Council Chairman of the Association of Towns and 
Villages of Zitny Island Istvan Pasztor said on Slovak Radio 
today. 
  He said that the programme of the meeting of Hungarian 
representatives, to be held in Komarno tomorrow, had originally 
included the establishment of a civic association of elected 
representatives of the Hungarian minority, but the Slovak 
Interior Ministry had said it would not register such a body. 
There was no sense in establishing an body with no legal 
competence, Pasztor said. 
  The meeting was expected to pass a resolution which will 
serve as a basis for the programmes of political parties and for 
further debate in parliament, he said. 
  Tomorrow's meeting is open only to elected representatives 
of 
towns and villages, parliamentary deputies, journalists and 
invited guests, Pasztor said. Representatives from all the 
foreign embassies in Bratislava and from the Council of Europe 
had been invited to the meeting, which would be conducted in 
Hungarian, with translation provided into Slovak and English.

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 5 (CTK) -- Proposals to form a wider 
coalition are aimed at ousting Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar 
from his post, Deputy Premier Sergej Kozlik told a Movement For 
a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) meeting today. 
  President Michal Kovac raised the issue of a wider coalition 
in his New Year's address, and opposition parties as well as 
part of the coalition Slovak National Party (SNS) supported the 
idea. 
  The programme for the April 1993 SNS conference in 
Ruzomberok, Central Slovakia, included the idea of a wider 
coalition, SNS Chairman Ludovit Cernak said today. 
  The 1994 budget vote, which took place in last December, 
tested the coalition's strength, HZDS Deputy Hvezdon Koctuch 
said. 
  The opposition aimed at the rejection of the budget, which 
they had hoped would result in a vote of no confidence in the 
government and Meciar, Koctuch said, adding that in this way the 
opposition would achieve its alleged aim that some other 
politician represent Slovakia as premier during the coming talks 
between U.S. President Bill Clinton and representatives of the 
Visegrad countries (Czech and Slovak Republics, Hungary and 
Poland). 
  Meciar is open to cooperation, said SNS Deputy Chairman 
Jozef 
Prokes, who had attended the meeting as a guest of honour. 
Prokes is a member of the SNS parliamentary group, which 
favours the HZDS-SNS coalition at all costs. 
  Cernak belongs to the SNS national democratic parliamentary 
group lobbying for a wider coalition.

  [Excerpt] Bratislava, Jan 3 (CTK) -- Slovak President 
Michal Kovac's urgent call for the creation of a broad 
government coalition, made in his new year's speech, was "a 
challenge" addressed to Premier Vladimir Meciar who has been 
stubbornly rejecting solution of social problems in this way, 
the trade union daily PRACA writes today. 
  It recalls that before he became president, Kovac was one of 
the leaders of the ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
(HZDS), of which Meciar is the chairman, who in the (June 1992) 
election campaign coined the idea of creating a government of 
experts irrespective of their party affiliation. 
  If Meciar interprets Kovac's proposal as a small revenge for 
their disputes, he will probably decide to continue fighting 
against the majority which can imagine a broad-coalition 
government with "his" movement, but without him, PRACA writes. 
  If Meciar accepts the challenge and "allows himself to be 
dismissed" because his time in this historical stage has run 
out, he will certainly return to political life as a messiah 
with which he already has his own experience, the paper adds. 
  Slovak President Michal Kovac's new year's appeal to parties 
and movements to look for suitable personalities for a 
broad-coalition government will probably give rise to much 
controversy, the left- leaning PRAVDA writes. 
  "Supporters of status quo from both the government and the 
opposition will assess (Kovac's) appeal as inappropriate," the 
paper says and adds that Kovac "does not want the HZDS and its 
chairman to do nothing less but... to share power and 
responsibility with other political subjects. They (the 
subjects) should cooperate with the HZDS as with a recognized 
partner, according to the president's notions. He may be asking 
too much of what our politicians are not capable," PRAVDA says. 
  But it adds that Kovac's appeal had to be made "because time 
for making a meaningful change is quickly running out." The 
economic and social situation in Slovakia has been too bad for 
social energy to be spent on unproductive political struggles 
and disputes, PRAVDA stresses. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 6 (CTK) -- State Secretary to the 
Slovak Privatisation Ministry and Government Office Head Ivan 
Lexa today protested the publication of false information 
regarding the seizing of his travel documents, Slovak Radio 
reported today. 
  He disagreed with a news agency report that a passport had 
been seized from the accused "Ivan L." because he had refused 
the summons of the police corps investigator for quite a long 
time. Lexa said he had been deprived of his travel documents 
because of the character of his criminal activities and not 
because he had refused the summons. 
  Slovak Alien and Passport Police seized the documents from 
Lexa in connection with the accusation of defamation of the 
state and its representative. Lexa is alleged to have cast 
doubt on the morals of President Michal Kovac and his 
professional capabilities due to his age. 
  According to Slovak Radio, Lexa's lawyer lodged a complaint 
against the defamation charge and demanded that it be labelled 
as illegal.

  [Text] Bratislava Jan 7 (CTK) -- The Slovak-Hungarian 
border, confirmed in Trianon in 1920 for Czechoslovakia, was no 
bargain for Slovakia, Slovak Transport Minister Roman Hofbauer 
tells today's pro-Meciar REPUBLIKA, published by the Slovak 
state-owned news agency TA SR. He adds that "it left the Slovak 
settlement, whose demise we are witnessing, at the mercy of 
Magyarisation." 
  In connection with Slovakia's south border, Hofbauer recalls 
that according to the original Trianon proposal, a part of the 
Hungarian territory had to be ceded to Slovakia. This did not 
happen because of a fierce resistance by Hungary and 
indifference of Czech representatives to the fate of Slovaks 
living in the currently Hungarian Matra mountains, or the "lower 
parts of the Slovak counties Novohrad, Gemer, Hont and Zemplin." 
  "The Masaryk-Benes -- Czechoslovak President Tomas Garrigue 
Masaryk and Foreign Minister Edvard Benes -- concept sacrificed 
the region in return for the questionable gain of Subcarpathian 
Ruthenia," Hofbauer claims. He adds that Hungary, too, has not 
been able to come to terms with the Trianon Treaty which is 
proved by Hungarian politicians' statements on representation of 
interests of "all" the Hungarians. "It is not essential whether 
it has been Tisza, Kun, Horthy, Kadar or the current Hungarian 
Government," Hofbauer says. 
  It was difficult to establish a precise dividing line 
between 
the lower (Hungary) and upper (Slovakia) part of the Hungarian 
kingdom due to the political development in the consequence of 
which the "population was strongly mixed" during the Turkish 
threat and anti- Habsburg rebellions, believes Hofbauer, and 
adds that there was no one to represent Slovakia during the 
talks of the joint border commissions in 1918. 
  He compares the current demands by Hungarian minority 
representatives to those by the Germans in the First Republic 
(Czechoslovakia between 1918 and 1938) for the cultural, 
educational, territorial and political autonomy going as far as 
the right to homeland. He says that the pre-Munich political 
leaders needed to justify by these demands their attitude in 
front of the international public. 
  The foreign politicians of the time did not try to verify 
whether this "loud cry" concealed anything more than calls by 
suffering and humiliated minorities, says Hofbauer, and 
indicates a similarity between the "therapists and peace-makers 
Lord Halifax and Lord Runciman, of that time and the current 
international negotiators in Bosnia and Herzegovina Cyrus Vance 
and Lord Owen."

  [Text] Sofia, January 5 (BTA) -- Bulgarian Transport 
Minister Kiril Ermenkov met his Serbian counterpart Zarko Katic 
in Belgrade today to discuss the transit of Bulgarian convoys 
through Serbia, to which the UN Sanctions Committee gave its 
consent. The Bulgarian guest was also received by Federal 
Transport Minister Blagoje Lucic and Serbian Prime Minister 
Nikola Sainovic, Channel One of the Bulgarian national TV said 
in its evening newscast. 
  The meeting between Mr. Ermenkov and Mr. Katic focused on 
the 
details of the transit of Bulgarian convoys through Serbia. The 
Bulgarian transport minister briefed the Serb officials on the 
decision of the UN Sanctions Committee on the conditions 
Bulgaria should observe, which it intends to do strictly. The 
Serbian side stated clearly that it will provide full assistance 
and will not hinder the Bulgarian trucks expected to set out to 
Europe along the United Nations-approved route within the next 
two weeks. 
  Today's meeting in Belgrade can be described as talks among 
experts, which specified the taxes to be paid on Bulgarian goods 
and considered the problems likely to arise during the shipment 
of Bulgarian goods through the territory of Serbia from the 
Bulgarian to the Hungarian border, Radio Free Europe 
correspondent Eli Yurukova reported from Belgrade. 
  Meanwhile, it became known that the Bulgarian cabinet would 
discuss tomorrow measures for the safe haulage of hazardous 
cargoes. Mr. Ermenkov has proposed that such shipments be 
escorted by vehicles suited to the purpose. An order on the 
protection and organization of transport will be issued. Mr. 
Ermenkov has proposed that Bulgaria accede to the European 
Agreement on International Haulage of Hazardous Goods.

  [Text] Tirana, January 7 (ATA) -- The leading council of 
the Party for Democratic Prosperity [PPD] in Macedonia, the 
biggest party of the Albanians in this former Yugoslav Republic, 
examined in one of its meetings the problem of the education of 
the Albanians in Macedonia. It asked for new possibilities for 
their education, because the number of the Albanians enrolled in 
schools in Macedonia is small. 
  The juridical commission of this party is working to prepare 
a draft law for the creation of private higher schools to be 
presented to the Macedonian parliament. There is hope that this 
parliament may help solve the problem of education in the 
Albanian language in Macedonia.

  [Text] Tirana, January 6 (ATA) -- The region of Ulcinj, 
with eighty per cent Albanians, is now an objective of the 
Serbian headquarters. According to a report in newspaper 
RILINDJA on January 5, the Valdanos Bay, known for its beauty 
and riches along the Adriatic Sea, will be transformed in a 
military base. 
  In a recent press conference, the commander of the Serbian 
and Montenegrin military-naval forces, Mr. Dojcilo Isakovic, 
cited by the pro-government Montenegrin newspaper POBJEDA spoke 
about creation of a naval base in the bay of Valdanos, near 
Ulcinj, which will cover an area of 340 hectares. 
  Reacting against the military plans of Belgrade, the 
secretary of the party of the Liberal League of Montenegro, Mr. 
Miodrag Burzan, stressed that during the time of the former 
Yugoslavia, Montenegro possessed 1/10 of the seashore. Now, 
seventy-eighty per cent of the naval forces is concentrated in 
this place. This movement of the naval forces in the seashore of 
Montenegro threatens in transforming this republic in a military 
base, stressed Burzan, adding that such projects, which are 
being planned even for the regions around the lake of Shkoder, 
aim at transforming Montenegro in a concentrated military camp.
