  [Text] Tirana, January 6 (ATA) -- "The issue of Kosovar 
Albanians is a great political problem. All are aware of the 
bad situation of human rights in Kosova. I know that the issue 
of Albanians is more profound and it is not limited only to 
human rights," Vesna Peshic, chairman of Civil Alliance Party in 
Belgrade said in an interview with the independent newspaper 
DITA INFORMACION. 
  Vesnia Peshic, professor of philosophy and sociology at the 
Belgrade University, is considered by Milovan Gjilasi, the most 
renowned Yugoslav dissident, as the only representative of the 
opposition that should be appreciated. Mrs. Peshic wrote in the 
book A Goridan Knot, should it be cut or...? that thus far it 
has been spoken of Albanians raping the Serbs but statistics 
show of the opposite. Because of this attitude Mrs. Pashic was 
declared traitor by the Belgrade government.

  [Text] Tirana, January 7 (ATA) -- The year which has just 
elapsed marked a tragic balance of the Serbian violence towards 
the Albanian school in Kosova. According to the Information 
Centre of Kosova, during the past 4 months, Serbian police has 
summoned and beaten over 150 teachers of elementary and 
secondary schools and over 30 pupils. In November, objective 
of the Serbian violence was the Naim Frasheri Albanian Teachers 
League in Pristina, which was searched three times in 
succession, while all its presidency was summoned for 
investigation. Police terror was exerted in this league's 
branches in Podujeva, Mitrovica, Peja, Rahovec, Malisheve, Klin, 
Vushtrri and Istog. About 10 directors of schools in various 
cities were sent to jail. The chairman of the Albanian 
teachers' league, Mazllum Kumanova, and 7 other teachers have 
been imprisoned since September 30. According to the vice 
chairman of the league, Mynish Hyseni, the number of the 
Albanian teachers and pupils sent to jail by Serbian police is 
not exact because it keeps increasing everyday. Serbian police 
arrests all those it considers suspicious.

  [Text] Tirana, January 9 (ATA) -- Fifty Albanian young 
fellows from Kosova were forcefully recruited by the Serbian 
Army during 1993. This is a special form of the repression of 
Serbian officials, a report of the Human Rights and Freedoms 
Defence Council in Prishtina said. The data provided by the 
report show that Albanian fellows who were forced to join the 
Serbian Army were born from 1966 to 1974. Most of them were 
arrested in streets or their homes and some of them were brought 
to military court. All Albanian recruits were sent to the 
barracks of the Serbian Army established outside Kosova.

  [Text] Warsaw, 7 Jan -- President Lech Walesa received 
today heads of defense departments of the Visegrad Group 
countries. The president appealed for working out a joint stand 
of the group on the "main issues." "I hope that whenever 
possible we shall speak with one voice -- we are stronger in 
solidarity," Walesa said. 
  "I hoped that after our victories, when we regained freedom 
and independence, we would create a common Europe more quickly, 
and I still see such a chance," the president said. He added 
that "on many occasions matters have been dealt with in our 
absence." "Time has come for us to participate and to demand the 
creation of systems to make us secure from the great powers of 
this world," he said. The meeting was also attended by Foreign 
Minister Andrzej Olechowski. 
  The Czech delegation is led by the first deputy minister of 
national defense. Observers are of the opinion that this is 
connected with a recent declaration by the Czech Government 
announcing independent actions to join NATO. 
  As Antonin Baudys, Czech minister of defense, stated on 
Thursday, the reason for his absence from the Warsaw meeting was 
"a lack of conviction on the need to work out a coordinated 
stand by the Four toward NATO."

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 7 -- The Czech Republic, Slovakia, 
Hungary and Poland regard full membership of NATO their 
strategic goal, defence chiefs of the four countries told 
reporters here Friday. 
  Speaking after the conclusion of their conference in Warsaw, 
the ministers of defence from the four states declared they 
expected the U.S. Partnership for Peace proposal to open the way 
to permanent working contacts with NATO and lead to a full 
membership of the alliance. 
  The Polish Defence Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk said that 
the 
Visegrad states expected the NATO summit in Brussels to be held 
in a few days' time to put this proposal to detail as well as 
fixing the dates for including the four countries in the 
transatlantic security system. 
  Kolodziejczyk was very critical of Thursday's statement by 
the Russian presidential spokesman who said that granting NATO 
membership to central European states would enrage the Russian 
military. "Either Russia has taken the road of democracy, or she 
still regards herself an empire and is feverishly looking for 
enemies," the minister commented. 
  He also made it clear that Poland was not at all interested 
in any security guarantees from the West. What Poland wanted 
was a full NATO membership, he explained. 
  Jiri Pospisil, the first deputy defence minister of the 
Czech 
Republic, told reporters here Friday that his country could join 
NATO on its own, if that method proved faster. If not, then the 
Czech Republic would join NATO together with the remaining 
Visegrad states, he added. 
  Lajos Fuer, the Hungarian defence minister, said that it 
would be NATO which would decide on whether new members will be 
accepted individually or as a group. He also warned against 
using the Partnership for Peace initiative for delaying a full 
NATO membership. 
  In the official communique issued after the conference, the 
ministers favourably assessed mutual relations between their 
countries and to-date results of cooperation. They pledged to 
continue this cooperation in future.

  [Text] Tirana, January 6 (ATA) -- As reported financial 
police has discovered cases of contraband fuels to Montenegro 
through Shkodra Lake. Recently the police detected cases of 
smuggling fuels into Montenegro through Buna River flowing from 
Shkodra Lake into the Adriatic. Major Muhamet Gradeci, head of 
Shkodra Financial Police, told ATA that the police in 
cooperation with police of order, discovered December 21, 1993 
in the coastal village of Pulaj near Buna, 30 kilometers from 
Shkodra, pipes which were used for smuggling fuels from Albania 
into Montenegro. The pipes were some 20 meters long and 
connected the coasts of Buna. 
  The pipe line is larger than the one discovered a month ago 
almost in the same place, Major Gradeci said and added that the 
other pipe line was some 10 centimeters broader and operated 
through pumps which carried fuels from tankers into Montenegro. 
Mr. Gradeci said he had suspicion that other pipes might exist 
in other areas of Buna River and added that financial police has 
been working to discover them. 
  The pipe lines have been installed by peasants of nearby 
zone 
who transport fuels which is provided to them by smugglers. The 
pipes were destroyed right after they were discovered but this 
was done only in the Albanian territory. 
  Smuggling with fuels is result of cooperation among Albanian 
and Montenegrin smugglers. Financial police is working to cut 
the threads of fuels smuggling. 
  A private fuels station in Velipoja, near Buna River flow, 
has been a good shelter for smugglers for a long time. 
Financial police has already blocked the station and every 
tanker which passes this way is suspicious of smuggling. Mr. 
Gradeci explained that 50 per cent of condraband fuels is 
carried out through the fuels station in Velipoja. 
  Attempts to smuggle with fuels increased especially by the 
end of last year and the beginning of the new year. Financial 
police and that of public order blocked December 30 evening 11 
tankers loaded with oil and the amount of fuels was not usual. 
After verification of documents the police controlled the 
destination the fuels were headed to. 
  On January 4, 1994, the police took possession of lorries 
and 
cars carrying 130 barrels of fuels. Half of the barrels carried 
kerosene which is not allowed to be transported by citizens but 
only through vehicles having the authorization of the government.

  [Text] Sofia, January 7 (BTA) -- Today TRUD frontpages a 
disclosure of President Zhelyu Zhelev's intention to take over 
direct command of the Bulgarian Army. According to his 
classified letter, circulated in 300 copies down the military 
chain of command last November, the president's advisors in his 
military office will rank as deputy commanders of an armed 
service to deputy chiefs of General Staff. The daily quotes the 
letter in full and cites anonymous experts in constitutional law 
as describing the act as a flagrant violation of the 
Constitution. "They do not rule out the possibility of 
demanding the president's removal from office in pursuance of 
Article 103 of Bulgarian Constitution," TRUD adds. A signed 
commentary in the same daily stresses that if President Zhelev 
nevertheless survives this scandal, he will have to learn a good 
lesson. For its part, the Socialists' daily DUMA quotes a 
well-known anonymous politician as saying that Prime Minister 
Lyuben Berov was kept in the dark about the letter for several 
weeks. Army General Lyuben Petrov, chief of General Staff of 
the Bulgarian Army, declined to comment on the president's order 
for DUMA yesterday.

<F P=106> [Report by Evgenia Drumeva] </F>
  [Excerpts] Sofia, January 7 (BTA) -- Today's press 
allegations that President Zhelyu Zhelev intended to assume 
direct command of the Bulgarian Army provoked a chain of 
reactions. 
  Speaking to a National Radio reporter, President Zhelev 
strongly denied the allegations and described them as 
"insinuations serving dubious political interests." Zhan 
Videnov, leader of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), did not 
deny he had prior information of the scandal which broke out in 
today's press and told a radio interviewer the issue had been 
addressed indirectly at his meeting with Filip Dimitrov, leader 
of the Union of the Democratic Forces (SDS), two days ago. In a 
radio statement Edvin Sugarev, MP of the SDS and leader of one 
of the SDS-affiliated parties, said the president should be 
asked to tender his resignation. 
  A front-page story in TRUD claims that President Zhelev 
intended to issue a decree by which he would assume direct 
command of the Bulgarian Army. The daily runs in full a 
November 1993 letter from President Zhelev to the defense 
minister and the chief of General Staff, according to which the 
advisers at the president's military office would get ranks from 
second-in-command of the armed services up to deputy chiefs of 
the General Staff. The daily quotes anonymous Constitutional 
Law experts as describing the act as "a flagrant violation of 
the Constitution." The Socialists' daily DUMA, says that Army 
General Lyuben Petrov, chief of the General Staff, declined to 
comment on the president's letter yesterday. 24 CHASA quotes an 
anonymous MP as saying that Prime Minister Lyuben Berov learned 
about the letter later (after it had been sent) but did not step 
in to defuse the scandal and his relations with the president 
had been tense ever since. The MP told 24 CHASA that advisers 
to the president had been building structures parallel to key 
units of the cabinet, which was one of the major reasons for the 
meeting between the SDS and BSP leaders. 
  We had fears over suggestions to give the president greater 
prerogatives than the ones outlined in the Constitution, Zhan 
Videnov said in a radio interview. According to him, these 
ideas originated with "intellectual, journalistic and social 
circles close to the office of the president" rather than with 
the office itself. "I must say we were informed in advance of 
the press scandal over the prerogatives of the president's 
military office which flared up today. We see it as an alarming 
symptom and though indirectly, this subject was part of our 
discussion," Zhan Videnov said about his meeting with SDS leader 
Filip Dimitrov. In a statement quoted on National Radio Dr. 
Zhelev commented, among other things, on the meeting between the 
SDS and BSP leaders, describing it as "a result of the grave 
crisis in both political forces, which arouses fear of the 
democratic institutions." The president disapproved the idea of 
a parliament-appointed caretaker government, as well as of the 
idea that parliament should work in the run-up to the elections. 
  Edvin Sugarev described today's press allegations as "a huge 
scandal... for which President Zhelev's resignation should be 
demanded." 
  The president's spokesman Valentin Stoyanov made an official 
statement on the press allegations late this afternoon. 
[passage omitted]. The statement was broadcast on national 
radio and television. In its main evening newscast television 
said three Socialist MP's have made an official request today 
for copies of the president's letter to the Defense Ministry and 
of the decree. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] A few minutes ago, in a short telephone 
conversation with our Croatian Television correspondent, we 
learned that an urgent cease-fire in central Bosnia has been 
agreed. [passage omitted] 
  [Unidentified correspondent] In response to a Croatian 
request that the Muslim offensive in central Bosnia be halted, 
an urgent cease-fire in central Bosnia was agreed. Generals 
Roso [Croat commander], Delic [Bosnian Muslim commander], and 
Briquemont are due to meet shortly. The Croatian side says this 
is a test for the overall solution of Croat-Muslim relations. 
  President Izetbegovic said after the two-hour latest round 
of 
the talks that he will order General Delic to implement an 
urgent cease-fire on all fronts in central Bosnia. 
  The two presidents may still continue their talks this 
evening in Petersberg castle in Bonn. The departure of the two 
delegations is scheduled for tomorrow. 
  The Muslim side undertook the obligation to reply to 
President Tudjman as to whether it accepts the draft agreement, 
which would have the binding character of a contract. The 
proposal, consisting of two parts, was made by Croatia. The 
signatories would be obligated to secure an urgent cease-fire, 
without any conditions, and the cessation of all hostilities. 
  President Tudjman proposed in the agreement that by 2400 on 
15 January all hostilities must end between the Croat and Muslim 
people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The signatories would also take 
the obligation that all units observe humanitarian rules and the 
laws of war. Disbanding of disobedient units is also envisaged. 
War criminals would be handed over to courts. 
  The agreement envisages closing detention centers and 
releasing prisoners by 31 January. Muslim acceptance of the 
agreement would guarantee free passage of humanitarian convoys 
and humanitarian aid. 
  The equality of Bosnian Muslim and Croat people in all areas 
is envisaged, as are respect for all human rights and civil 
freedoms without any discrimination and under international 
control. 
  The agreement, which the Muslim side has to accept or refuse 
by 15 January, and which President Izetbegovic -- as he said -- 
will personally support at the Sarajevo Presidency, also 
envisages how mutual relations within the Union of Republics of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will be organized, with Croat and Muslim 
people exercising respect for each other. 
  The agreement demands 17.5 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina for 
the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and 33.33 percent for the 
Bosnian Muslim republic. 
  All contentious issues are to be resolved only in a 
peaceful, 
political way, without resorting to the use of force. 
  The town of Mostar will be administered by the European 
Union 
for up to two years, the agreement envisages. Mostar will be 
the capital of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. A separate 
agreement will secure the return of its citizens to the town. 
  An agreement on which the Muslims are to voice their opinion 
by 15 January envisages that if the Union of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
disintegrates, there will be no changes to the borders between 
the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and the Bosnian Muslim 
republic. These two republics could have special relations with 
Croatia if the Serbs break up the union of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
The Bosnian Muslim republic would in that case have the right 
to join the Croatian state. I will read out several articles: 
  Article 8 says: Signatories to this document are agreed that 
they will secure for the Bosnian Muslim republic access to the 
sea in a way not threatening the sovereignty and integrity of 
the Republic of Croatia and interests of the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna, taking into consideration the needs and the 
justified interests of the Bosnian Muslim republic in a way that 
will ensure permanent cooperation. 
  The Republic of Croatia and the Union of the Republics of 
Bosnia- Herzegovina are to conclude -- after an agreement on the 
set-up of Bosnia-Herzegovina within the international conference 
on former Yugoslavia has come into effect -- agreements on the 
use of free port zones in the ports of Ploce and Rijeka, in 
accordance with principles and provisions of the UN convention 
on transit trade of land-locked countries, i.e. on the 
principles agreed upon in a draft agreement on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina on board the Invincible. 
  In case the Union of the Republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
ceases to exist, the Republic of Croatia pledges that it will 
consider the Bosnian Muslim republic a successor to all rights 
and obligations stemming from the agreement on the use of free 
port zones. 
  Article 10 says: Signatories to this agreement guarantee 
that 
on the territory of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and the 
Bosnian Muslim republic voluntary and safe return of all 
refugees to the place of their previous residence will be 
secured. They accept control and supervision by international 
bodies in the implementation of this obligation. 
  Article 15 says: The Republic of Croatia believes that in 
case the Serbs break up the Bosnia-Herzegovina union, it is 
possible and necessary in the view of protecting and realizing 
the interests of the Croat and the Bosnian Muslim nations to set 
up an alliance between the Republic of Croatia and the Bosnian 
Muslim republic that will be of an economic and defensive 
nature. In that case, the Republic of Croatia is ready to set 
up an alliance of states that will have the following goals: 
  -- securing permanent friendship and cooperation; 
  -- securing economic and social development in the common 
economic area with the gradual creation of a common market, 
customs union, and coordination of monetary and financial policy 
with the final goal of creating a monetary union; and 
  -- securing cooperation in the areas of jurisdiction and 
internal affairs, coordination of their common foreign policy, 
creation of a joint defense policy, and conclusion of an 
agreement on cooperation in the spheres of defense and security. 
  I have read out only a few important articles of the 
agreement. This would not be just an ordinary agreement. Alija 
Izetbegovic did not accept it straight away, because he linked 
it with the realization of some issues relating to the 
territorial settlement in central Bosnia, Mostar, and access to 
the sea. 
  We shall see 15 January whether the Muslims will accept 
President Tudjman's proposal. Let us just repeat at the end of 
this dispatch that the Croatian demand for the Muslim offensive 
to stop was replied to by an agreement on an immediate 
cease-fire in central Bosnia, while Generals Roso, Delic, and 
Briquemont are to meet immediately and issue adequate orders.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Croatian Foreign Minister Mate </F>
Granic in Bonn by unidentified studio correspondent -- live] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Good evening. 
  [Granic] Good evening. 
  [Correspondent] Minister, what is most interesting is the 
17.5 percent [of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina] that 
Croatia is asking for the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, and 
here I can see some towns that would be included in the 
territorial division of that republic. 
  [Granic] During the latest negotiations in Brussels, the 
European Union accepted that the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna 
should have 17.5 percent of the territory. Croatia today put 
forward not only a contractual agreement on the settlement, a 
cease-fire, and the overall regulation of Croat-Muslim relations 
within the three-republic union, but also said that should the 
union disintegrate, an alliance of states between the Bosnian 
Muslim and the Croatian states will be created. As you can see, 
this map is a Croatian proposal for the settlement. You can 
also see that the Croatian side has made no concessions on Neum 
and that a very important economic and ethnic part of the 
Croat-populated area has been encompassed. 
  [Correspondent] Minister, please tell us whether 
negotiations are continuing, or are we now waiting for something 
to happen by 15 January. 
  [Granic] The Muslim side accepted this proposal with a great 
deal of interest. Mr. Alija Izetbegovic himself said he will 
support this proposal. What we discussed most was how to halt 
all offensive actions, particularly those carried out by Bosnian 
Muslim forces against central Bosnia. It should be also said 
that no agreement has been reached regarding a settlement in 
central Bosnia. Talks on Mostar are to continue in Medjugorje 
on Thursday. Talks on the final economic access to the sea are 
also continuing. 
  [Correspondent] Minister, please tell us the most 
interesting thing: An urgent cease-fire for central Bosnia has 
been agreed. How is this going to be done? 
  [Granic] In agreement with Mr. Akashi, Mr. Stoltenberg has 
already organized a meeting between the military commanders, 
Generals Roso and Delic. President Izetbegovic is to issue an 
order to General Delic to halt all offensive actions. The Croat 
side will strictly observe the cease-fire. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you very much, Minister.

  [Text] The permanent mission of Croatia attached to the 
European Union [EU] in Brussels has issued a special statement 
in which it informs all members and the whole Union of the 
results of the Croatian-Muslim talks in Bonn. 
  The statement says that Alija Izetbegovic, president of the 
Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, supported the proposal made by 
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman concerning a cease-fire and 
the territorial delineation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Muslim 
side has not yet signed, and the Muslim side points out that 
talks should continue on some details. 
  The Croatian mission attached to the EU provides detailed 
information about the agreements reached at the meeting -- under 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] auspices -- by the military 
commanders of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] and the Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The statement lays special emphasis on the agreement that a 
meeting be held on 14 January in Medjugorje at which talks would 
be held on the establishment of an EU administration in Mostar. 
It also carries the whole proposal of President Tudjman put 
forward at the meeting in Bonn. 
  We recall that President Tudjman made the offer that by 15 
January at 0000, all hostilities between the Croatian and the 
Muslim peoples must cease. The signatories would then bind 
themselves to adhering to humanitarian and international warfare 
law. It was envisaged that (?disobedient) formations would be 
disbanded and that war criminals would be tried. The agreement 
envisages the closure of prison camps and the release of 
prisoners by 31 January. Muslim accession to this agreement 
would guarantee the free passage of humanitarian convoys and 
humanitarian aid. The agreement envisages the regulation of 
relations in the Union of Republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
accompanied by the mutual respect of the Croat and Muslim 
people. 
  The agreement seeks 17.5 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina for 
the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, and 33.33 percent for the 
Bosniak Muslim republic. The town of Mostar would be under EU 
administration for up to two years. It would be the capital of 
Herceg-Bosna and the return of its citizens would be ensured by 
a special agreement. 
  The agreement -- a statement on which will be issued by the 
Muslims by 15 January -- envisages that if the Union of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina falls apart there would not be changes in the 
borders between the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and the 
Bosniak-Muslim republic. These two republics would be able to 
establish special relations with Croatia.

  [Text] Geneva, Jan 10 (AFP) -- Relief flights into 
Sarajevo, suspended last week after an attack on the city's 
airport, are to resume Tuesday, UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees [UNHCR] spokesman Ron Redmond said Monday. 
  Redmond said UN officials had received new assurances from 
Bosnian Serbs and the Moslem-led Bosnian Government about the 
safety of aid flights, suspended after a rocket landed on the 
runway on January 5. The countries participating in the 
operation -- Germany, Canada, the United States, France, Britain 
and Norway -- had agreed to the resumption of flights, he added. 
  Redmond said 21 flights into the Bosnian capital were 
planned 
for Tuesday. The first aircraft of the day would be a Canadian 
plane flying out of Ancona in Italy. 
  An attempt was made on Sunday to resume the aid operation, 
but stopped after four flights because of the security situation 
around the capital.

<F P=106> [Article by Kresimir Meler and Branka Horvatek: "Development </F>
Plan for Croatian Army"] 
  [Text] Croatia should develop one of the strongest, if not 
the strongest, army in southeast Europe within 10 years. It 
will also incorporate a rapid deployment unit, which will, "if 
necessary, defend Croatian interests and the Croatian minority 
on all territories of the former Yugoslavia." As of now, this 
is only a proposal by a group of generals and politicians who 
belong to the rightist, radical fraction of the HDZ [Croatian 
Democratic Community]. Considering the present situation of the 
Croatian Armed Forces and the HDZ itself, it is quite realistic 
that these plans will actually be carried out. With rare 
exceptions, the Croatian Army General Staff and the commanding 
officers in the brigades consist of members of the ruling party 
who could, even if the ruling party were to be replaced, carry 
out the policy of their party unopposed, or even prevent the 
winning party from taking office. 
  What kind of future does the "Development Plan for the 
Croatian Armed Forces" foresee? As stated, "the present 
unstable political-military situation in southeastern Europe 
will continue in the coming years, maybe for the whole decade." 
  According to all available data, the situation in the parts 
of the country where the Serbian population is in the majority 
will not normalize. Serbia will continue to supply these areas 
with large amounts of weapons, and the threat of terrorist 
groups must be taken into account. Having a border with a 
possible Muslim state, which could cut through the territory of 
the Republic of Croatia, thereby hampering a free flow of people 
and goods, presents military and security problems. Moreover, 
the border with the present FRY will be extremely difficult to 
control. In the future, this border will have to remain a 
concern of highest priority. Along its most critical points it 
will have to be reinforced with heavy armored, motorized, and 
special airborne forces. 
  Acting as a constant destabilizing factor, the so-called FRY 
will probably continue "to lay claim not only to some parts of 
the Republic of Croatia but also to the territory of other 
states formed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia." 
  Given this assessment of the situation, it was only to be 
expected that the plan would propose "the gradual formation of 
an army that will be capable not only of protecting its borders 
if attacked from outside, but also of launching strong 
counterattacks on enemy's positions on enemy's territory, as 
well as pre-emptive strikes on enemy bases near the Croatian 
border. The Croatian Armed Forces must be ready in the future to 
respond quickly to protect ethnic Croats who live outside of the 
borders of the Republic of Croatia." 
  According to the planning being done by the Croatian 
generals, the Croatian Army should focus on acquiring U.S. 
military hardware or on cooperation with countries that produce 
weapons and equipment under U.S. license. If all these plans are 
fulfilled, the U.S. armament industry should prosper. Croatia 
plans to purchase 210 Phantom aircraft of various models. The 
first delivery will replace 40 MiG-21 and Jastreb aircraft. The 
Croatian Air Force plans to replace them in the next two years. 
  The remaining aircraft would be purchased over the next five 
years. There are also detailed plans regarding helicopters. The 
Croatian Government has already bought 10 MD-500 helicopters 
made under U.S. license in South Korea. Argentina manufactures 
missiles and machine guns for these helicopters. They are highly 
maneuverable. They can be also equipped with a submarine 
detector, TOW laser-guided antitank rockets, Martin Pescador 
air-to-ground missiles (to destroy radar systems), double lasers 
for Stinger missiles, two torpedos, a GE six-barrel mobile 
7.62-mm minigun, a Hydra 70 launcher for 70-mm tracer bullets, 
and an infrared decoy emitter device. Half of these helicopters 
are already flying with HVO [Croatian Defense Council] markings. 
The total should reach approximately 100 in four years, in 
addition to a larger number of transport helicopters and 
aircraft. 
  Croatia would also like to buy radar and missile systems, 
leopard tanks, and long-range artillery made in the United 
States or under U.S. license. To reduce costs, individual parts 
would be produced in Croatia -- difficult to accomplish 
considering the technological capacities of Croatian industry. 
The Army will receive an appropriation equal to 45 percent of 
the state budget, or about $1.3 billion. Over the next five 
years at least, the Army would receive 36.7 percent of the 
supplemental revenue derived from taxes on all goods and 
services. Consequently, Croatia would have to take out loans, 
which will in turn require forming strategic alliances with 
certain countries. 
  It is against this background that one should interpret 
Croatian defense minister's proposal that Zemunik airport be 
turned into a U.S. military base for the operations throughout 
southeast Europe, that the Rijeka shipyard be made available for 
repair services for the Sixth Fleet, and that U.S. Navy ships be 
given permanent docking privileges in any Croatian port they 
choose. 
  Croatian military strategy would be a complete -- maybe 
slightly modified -- copy of the Israeli defense system. 
  The toughest problem (although the Croatian authorities will 
not admit it) will be officer training. So far, Croatia does not 
have a satisfactory educational system at all. It is a fact that 
it lacks military secondary schools, let alone a military 
academy or so-called military colleges, in which the cadets 
could acquire know-how to advance to the highest military ranks. 
There is a shortage of senior officers. Moreover, only a few 
generals would be capable of passing a rigorous exam, with the 
exception of those that came over from the JNA [Yugoslav 
People's Army]. However, there are only very few of them and 
they have been kept inactive for now. 
  Another option would be training abroad, limited to the 
United States or to countries that buy the weapons from the 
United States or its licensees. The "unsolved problems with the 
western neighbor and Italy" are also mentioned, which inevitably 
leads to the question of whether the Balkans is going to 
eventually wind up with another unpredictable "Balkan policeman."

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Jarnjak, minister of internal affairs </F>
of the Republic of Croatia, by Marko Barisic; place and date not 
given: "Serbs Do Not Feel Like Leaving Croatia"] 
  [Text] There are many reasons for an interview with Mr. 
Ian Jarnjak, who was the mayor of Krapina and the deputy 
minister of internal affairs before becoming the minister of 
internal affairs. There have recently been so many events that 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs has to say something about, 
they cannot fit into an interview. We first asked Minister 
Jarnjak to assess safety in the Republic of Croatia. 
  [Jarnjak] It has been noticed that the number of the most 
serious crimes, such as murders, terrorist actions, or planting 
of bombs and explosives, has dropped compared to 1992. We are 
happy about this and wish to highlight it as the main 
characteristic of 1993. We can say that safety is better than 
in the previous years. Clearly, there has also been less war 
conflict. It must be pointed out that we have had two tourist 
seasons, in which not even the slightest incident has occurred, 
so that we can say that Croatia is a stable low-risk country. 
The remark made by the Italian minister of internal affairs 
during the meeting in Italy in June 1993 that Italian citizens 
know that Croatia is safer than Italy is interesting in this 
context. 
  [Barisic] Still, some towns are more dangerous than others, 
Split for example. 
  [Jarnjak] The Ministry of Internal Affairs makes a list of 
everything that happens in the country every month. Based on 
this information we plan our actions and personnel changes, if 
necessary. After we had discussed these monthly reports we 
realized that the situation in Split is worse than the Croatian 
average, which was the signal for us to respond to this 
situation. The first thing we did was to improve the personnel 
structure. We took a series of measures, among other things we 
dismissed the then chairman of the Police Department for Split 
and Dalmatia, but the new one did not achieve the expected 
results, either. Then we brought a third man and gave him until 
the end of 1993 as a deadline to create order. We also took 
preventive and repressive actions, we brought several hundred 
policemen from other parts of Croatia to Split to help their 
colleagues, especially at border crossings and in Dubrovnik. 
After that, 500 new policemen came to help establish order. 
Split is a distinct area from many aspects, primarily because 
of refugees, but living in the city no longer entails any great 
risk, but is like any other town in Croatia. I think that 
safety in Split is improving and that it will soon be above the 
Croatian average. 
  [Barisic] What do you think about the border between Croatia 
and Herceg-Bosna as far as smuggling and economic crimes are 
concerned? 
  [Jarnjak] This is a very complex question. As the deputy 
minister of internal affairs, I met with representatives of the 
Croatian communes in Bosnia-Herzegovina as far back as 1991. We 
discussed this problem and reached the agreement -- according to 
the proposal by President Tudjman -- to establish some kind of 
border because the Croats from Bosnia-Herzegovia kept on buying 
various goods, especially gasoline, in Croatia. That kind of 
border was not a problem for honest people, but smuggling 
developed into a big problem here. Legal stipulations favored 
it since the taking of goods to Herceg-Bosna was treated as a 
classic export, which could not be controlled. After this 
stipulation became ineffective, this border became like any 
other; the crime is here no bigger than at any other border 
crossing. 
  It was at this border that we achieved good cooperation 
between the police, the customs and the finance police. I think 
that we have established good cooperation with Mr. Prlic, the 
prime minister of Herceg-Bosna, and with Mr. Coric, the minister 
of internal affairs, by a recent agreement, which is already 
showing the first results. This is now a flexible, open border, 
but nevertheless everything is under control. 
  [Barisic] What are relations between the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs of the Republic of Croatia and the institutions 
of Herceg-Bosna like? 
  [Jarnjak] The Ministry of Internal Affairs and, I dare say, 
me, as the minister, did everything we could to help our 
Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina defend themselves. We are 
now helping them in organizing their police from the point of 
view of logistics, personnel and organization. We visited the 
border crossings in 1991 and talked to the people who are now 
high-ranking officials in Herceg-Bosna about the preparation of 
the defense strategy. I informed Mr. Tudjman on these talks and 
asked him to help us define the best way to help them. The 
president supported our ideas so we founded a training center, 
and this was visited by Croats from the whole of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. We made a program in the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs that included an 11-day course organized in 
Makarska. This program can be compared to a spider's web; 
several people who wanted to become local commanders in their 
Croatian place in Bosnia attended the course. They were taught 
to organize themselves and make units. I would like to point 
out that these courses were organized as early as 1991 -- while 
there was peace there. Approximately 1,500 people attended 
these courses. They have been in charge of the defense of 
Herceg-Bosna from the very beginning. When the first group 
completed the course and went to Bosnia-Herzegovina, they were 
sworn in by Mate Boban on behalf of Herceg-Bosna, and by me on 
behalf of Croatia. 
  These courses were secret because these people were not to 
be discovered. I told you all these things to show you that our 
cooperation dates back to 1991. I would like to add that we did 
not interfere with the integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a 
state; we simply did not want to allow Croatian regions to 
remain unprepared for defense. 
  [Barisic] What do you think about the documents published in 
the press accusing Tomislav Mercep, an adviser at the Ministry 
of Internal Affairs? 
  [Jarnjak] I do not think that he is being charged with 
something, he is only being accused, because he can be charged 
with something only by the attorney general. It is correct that 
during the investigation of the murder in the Zec family some 
people made very broad statements and told us things we did not 
know before. The collected material was forwarded to the Office 
of the Attorney General. The outcome of the trial for murder is 
well known, but we as the Ministry of Internal Affairs have no 
right and we do not want to comment on decisions made by courts. 
After I read the article in GLOBUS, I first tried to find out 
whether the Ministry of Internal Affairs gave any kind of 
information about this case and asked the Ministry employees to 
make written reports. I learned that the Zagreb Police 
Department reported on this case in the second half of December 
1991 at the request of the Office for the Protection of the 
Constitutional Order, and there are documents about it. We 
wrote our report in three copies: One was left at the Zagreb 
Police Department, and two were forwarded to the aforementioned 
office. The complete case was submitted to the attorney general 
for further procedure. This means that the police accomplished 
its part of the task. 
  As far as concerns the question how our report reached the 
public, I have to say that I examined the Ministry employees; 
all persons who could have somehow had access to the report, or 
had any knowledge on it, were asked to make written reports. 
They stated, with moral and financial accountability, that none 
of them enabled anybody to come to this information. 
  [Barisic] Does this mean that this information leaked out 
from the Office for the Protection of the Constitutional Order? 
  [Jarnjak] I do not know where the information came from, but 
I would like to point out that according to written reports it 
did not come out from the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Should 
it be proven during the investigation that one of the Ministry 
employees made a false statement, the consequences are clear, 
regardless of who this person is. The Ministry of Internal 
Affairs will not tolerate the removal of documents marked as 
"state secret." I would like to stress -- no matter who this 
person is. Not because the public should not be informed, but 
because the case has been handled by the attorney general, in 
which case the Ministry of Internal Affairs can be involved only 
upon order of the attorney general if necessitated by some 
additional information. From this point of view it is clear 
that Ministry employees are not allowed to bring information 
into circulation. These are the facts and the genesis of the 
whole case. 
  Personally, I think that the person who spread this 
information did not have good intentions. If he wanted to 
stimulate the functioning of the constitutional state, it would 
have been enough if he had told the attorney general and 
judicial authorities to handle the case, since the attorney 
general is not obliged to accept all information received from 
the police. For this reason there is a division of power into 
the executive, judicial and legislative. I think that the 
attorney general should have responded and stated whether there 
was material for bringing a charge against Mercep or not. We do 
not want to protect anybody, but nobody can be blackened by 
information at a point when the deed has not yet been proven. 
It is also bad to pull this case out of the context of 1991 and 
look at it from the perspective of 1993. I do not want to 
excuse the committed crimes, the law has to be respected, but 
the law has to respected also as far as the spreading of 
confidential information is concerned. I shall always support 
correct work. We know which institutions could have treated 
this case and which we could have contacted if we wanted to do 
Croatia good. I think that the person who spread this 
information did no good either to the individuals connected with 
this case or to the state. I condemn such methods. 
  [Barisic] How many applications for Croatian citizenship 
were refused and why? 
  [Jarnjak] We received 527,581 applications, and 25,493 
applications were rejected, mostly because the formal conditions 
were not met. It is important to know that numerous people came 
to Croatia as refugees and that many of them asked for Croatian 
citizenship. It is clear that the applicants who have not lived 
in Croatia for at least five years were refused. A small number 
of applicants were refused for other reasons, so that the number 
of negative applications is not that big taking into 
consideration the total number of applications. 
  [Barisic] The Serbian People's Party constantly stresses, 
however, that the Serbs have problems in obtaining Croatian 
citizenship. 
  [Jarnjak] Whenever the Serbian People's Party asked us for 
an explanation in a case, we reconsidered it and responded. I 
cannot speak in general about dissatisfaction because there are 
examples that some associations submitted lists consisting of 
150 people who were allegedly refused Croatian citizenship, and 
more than half of them never asked for it. For this reason I 
cannot accept general accusations of the type that Serbs, for 
example, have problems with it. Also Croats have problems. 
Very indicative is the following information. Up to now 2,483 
Croats have asked to renounce their Croatian citizenship, 
whereas only 82 Serbs have made such an application. There are 
rumors that the Serbs do not feel like leaving Croatia, and I 
can say that there are no significant reasons why they should 
feel like leaving Croatia. This is a sign that the 
constitutional state is functioning. 
  You have to admit that it was not easy to solve all these 
cases in one or two years. The Ministry of Internal Affairs 
worked in four shifts, day and night, we entered all applicants 
into the computer (we have the data stored on diskettes now); we 
created a data base for Croatia. Some data still have to be 
checked, but we have a data base. At the beginning people had 
to wait for a long time for their documents, but we do not have 
this problem any more. It is normal that there are people who 
cannot obtain Croatian citizenship. There is not such a state 
in the world that would give everybody citizenship. In some 
states people wait for years. Admittedly, it is a special 
situation, but I have to repeat that in most cases only those 
applicants were refused who did not fulfill the basic 
conditions. These people are entitled to appeal before the 
Administrative Court. If this court makes a positive decision, 
we carry it out immediately. 
  [Barisic] What is the national structure of the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs employees? 
  [Jarnjak] There are 93 percent Croats, 4.7 percent Serbs, 
1.3 Muslims and 1 percent others. 
  [Barisic] This structure will probably change if Manolic's 
proposal that members of Martic's units enter the Croatian 
police is accepted. 
  [Jarnjak] Croatian citizens of Serbian nationality will join 
the Croatian police; not every applicant, only those who meet 
the criteria established by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. 
This means that they will have to pass certain tests. We 
cannot accept a criminal or a person who has already been 
convicted. Apart from that, Croatian policemen are required to 
have appropriate education. Not everybody is entitled to be a 
Croatian policeman. These criteria will be applied to future 
policemen of the Serbian nationality. Nobody can be admitted 
without having fulfilled these conditions, otherwise the 
professional level of the Croatian police could fall below the 
level we need. 
  [Barisic] The administrative law on the rights of minorities 
provides the possibility of autonomous police in Glina and Knin. 
  [Jarnjak] We are prepared to organize also these police 
forces, we have established police departments in these communes 
and we have plans on how to organize the work in the police 
stations in all the places that should have them: Petrinja, 
Glina, Knin, Topusko, Vukovar, Beli Manastir, Okucani.... When 
the conditions are met, we shall organize the police's work 
there: border control, maintenance of law and order as well as 
all the other tasks that the Croatian police has to perform. 
According to the administrative law from 1991 the police forces 
in these places should be formed according to the national 
structure of the population. We shall respect this law. 
  [Barisic] Which international organizations was the Ministry 
of Internal Affairs of Croatia admitted to and what is the 
cooperation with these organizations like? 
  [Jarnjak] We were only interested in Interpol, which we 
joined in 1992. Our cooperation with Interpol members is good 
and useful. Interpol works according to the principle that the 
member states within an area sign bilateral agreements on 
cooperation in the prevention of crime in general. We have 
signed such an agreement with Slovenia, Italy, Hungary, Ukraine, 
and Albania. Apart from that, we have signed a protocol with 
Slovakia. Now we have to sign such agreements with other close 
countries, such as Austria, Germany and others. The everyday 
cooperation with close countries is good, especially in stamping 
out organized crime. We have already had several successes in 
actions with the police of the neighboring countries. 
  [Barisic] What is cooperation like with the police of the 
Muslim part of Bosnia-Herzegovina? Can you comment on the 
rumors that Zagreb is the largest logistics base for the Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is fiercely attacking the Croatian 
enclaves in Central Bosnia? 
  [Jarnjak] From time to time the Croatian police checks the 
work of humanitarian organizations as possible logistics 
centers. The people who work there must have legal status in 
Croatia, in order to prevent illegal acts or crime that could 
affect the sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia. There might 
be various rumors, but these are the facts. 
  [Barisic] What are the priority tasks of the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs in the next period? 
  [Jarnjak] We have the necessary personnel and the technical 
equipment now. We shall now have to solve the problem of our 
facilities, because our police stations and even department 
offices do not have appropriate accommodation. As far as other 
priorities are concerned, we shall especially insist on the high 
quality of police work. We shall work on the further education 
of our staff. Further on, we shall have to improve the 
discipline, there must be no incidents whatsoever. In short, we 
shall make our police professional; the Croatian policeman must 
be a correct and kind professional, loyal to his state and his 
people, regardless of his working conditions and the place in 
which he works.

<F P=106> [Article by Fran Visnar: "Powerful Son of a Powerful </F>
Father"] 
  [Excerpt] After the reconstruction of the Croatian 
security and intelligence services in November this year [1993], 
foreigners residing in Croatia for very particular 
(surveillance) purposes noted the following questions in their 
operational diaries: Considering the size of Croatia, does it 
need so many intelligence services, which creates unnecessary 
duplication in civilian and military structures? Is this 
organization of services, which is actually inert and bulky, a 
reflection of the democratic face of the Croatian authorities, 
or is this nevertheless the seamy side of a regime that displays 
all the hallmarks of a police state? 
<H5>  The Number of Services Is Not Too High </H5>
  Although it would be interesting to see what the foreign 
intelligence officers wrote in their reports in reply to the 
questions they asked, their opinion, for the time being, is not 
available for public scrutiny, not even in countries from which 
they originate. We will, therefore, attempt to supply some 
answers on our own and dispel at least some of the mystification 
about the regrouping of the Croatian intelligence and security 
apparatus. 
  In the past three years, Croatia as a sovereign country, in 
addition to the army, has also created its own police force, as 
well as the security services without which no independent 
country in the world can function. Considering that Croatia is 
still involved in a very complex conflict with Serbia and local 
rebel Serbs, and is significantly involved in the war still 
raging in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the number of Croatian 
intelligence services is not too high. 
  However, something else is more important in this matter. In 
countries with a developed intelligence and security apparatus 
and parliamentary democracy, it is very important who controls 
the entire system, whether it has 500 or 20,000 intelligence 
officers and security clerks. Specialized parliamentary 
commissions and committees can definitely not do this. They 
only serve as a kind of occasional democratic inspection. 
Consequently, within an intelligence system, there is always an 
internal watch dog, taken from that walk of life and appointed 
as main supervisor, that is, the controller of all the 
intelligence and security agencies. In Croatia, after Manolic's 
official era, the HIS [Croatian Information Service] had that 
function, and not Sarinic's UNS [Office for National Security] 
(an advisory body to the Croatian president). 
  What disturbs the world is that Miroslav Tudjman, the son of 
Franjo Tudjman, has been appointed head of the HIS. That is 
usually seen in undemocratic political systems, Arabian 
sheikdoms, or in openly autocratic dictatorial regimes. In 
Syria, President Assad appointed his brother controller of all 
the civilian and military intelligence and counterintelligence 
services and he has held that position for decades. In Rumania, 
Nicu Ceausescu, the omnipotent son of his father -- the dictator 
-- was the same. In North Korea, Kim Il Sung trusts only his 
own son Kim Il Yong, who maintains strict discipline and party 
rule in the huge apparatus of the state security (115,000 
people). 
<H5>  The West Is Sensitive to That </H5>
  The West is really sensitive to this. In Great Britain, 
there would be a crisis in the cabinet if the queen asked the 
prime minister to appoint her brother or her son as the main 
controller of the board of directors that supervises British 
intelligence services MI5, MI6, DIS, and GCHQ. In Israel, in 
that case there would be a quarrel in the Knesset and new 
elections. In Germany, something like that would be taken as a 
good joke, and in France, Sweden, and Italy, as a dangerous 
political move and precedent. 
  In our case, the unpleasantness of such a comparison may be 
alleviated by the knowledge of the balance of political forces 
not only in the state but also in the ruling HDZ [Croatian 
Democratic Community]. Of several candidates, Miroslav Tudjman 
is presently the best choice for the head of HIS. In addition 
to having successfully, and in a scientific manner, studied the 
principles of information society [previous two words printed in 
bold type], Miroslav Tudjman's elitist humanist education gives 
him the following advantage in relation to his competition (of 
course, all of whom were members of the HDZ): He has modern 
thoughts and is not inferior to those he commands (and controls) 
and, more important for this job, he never publicly asserts his 
personal views. No Gojko Susak [minister of defense] will be 
able to afford to ignore (as during the era of coordinator 
Manolic) the opinion of the new head of the HIS, who also has 
high formal authority in the field of national security. 
  For that function, Miroslav Tudjman is a better solution 
than Hrvoje Sarinic, who is, on the other hand, ideal for the 
job of principal adviser in the president's cabinet, and not for 
the keeper of the key who can put into motion or halt such an 
expensive and sensitive organization as the national 
intelligence system. The UNS will now function exactly as was 
originally planned -- as an national security advisory office of 
the head of state (something that exists in most Western 
democratic systems), and not as an independent intelligence 
agency superior to everyone. 
  We also have to consider something else. Miroslav Tudjman is 
an intellectual who has been developing a social-democratic 
profile for years. That means that the head of the HIS will not 
be an inexperienced, but aggressive hawk that will kill everyone 
in the hen house to take but one hen as its prey. In other 
words: He will assert his authority through his knowledge and 
fierce professional debate (which is a common practice in 
intelligence methodology), and not by intolerance and 
bureaucratic court games; he will stimulate mutual cooperation 
and not rivalry in the Croatian intelligence community. Those 
who pretend to his position and advocate the so called hard line 
in the HDZ, whose philosophy of life naturally contains nepotism 
and connections, will carefully consider whether it pays 
directly or indirectly to attack someone who is, after all, the 
son of the president (both of the party and of the state). 
  And there is another thing, which commentaries in the 
Croatian and international press have neglected to point out, on 
the occasion of Miroslav Tudjman's appointment to the position 
of the head of HIS: The military and civilian security and 
intelligence system in Croatia will, in future, act within its 
legal province. The SIS [Security and Information Service], 
conceived as a military [last word printed in bold type] 
counterintelligence service, will remain firmly in the domain of 
the army and army barracks (it cannot go beyond that area), 
while the VOS [Military Intelligence Service] will continue to 
do his job: procuring and analyzing intelligence data of 
military and strategic importance. 
<H5>  Double-Faced Coat </H5>
  The head of the HIS is to see to that this limit is not 
exceeded, that authorizations and information are not 
intertwined, and that rivalry is reduced to the minimum. The 
reconstruction of the Croatian intelligence security apparatus 
also shows that the intelligence capability of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs will definitely have to improve, while a good 
part of the remaining field in the Croatian intelligence 
community will be plowed exclusively by the SZUP -- the 
(civilian) Service for Protecting the Constitutional System. If 
there are any doubts as to why the SIS exists at all, there 
should be no doubts as to the purpose of the SZUP. That service 
could even change its name (a common practice in, for example, 
Germany for similar agencies), but one should nevertheless admit 
that this is a security organization that is, technologically 
and professionally speaking, the strongest and the most 
professional in Croatia, because of one small advantage: In 
addition to continued counterintelligence and anti-terrorist 
operational activities, it can also serve as an intelligence 
organization against its opponents. The SZUP is, therefore, 
like a reversible coat -- on one side it has a standard 
(civilian) color, and on the other camouflage. 
  Still, do we really need so many security services? Bearing 
in mind several external and internal factors, the question is 
equal to the dilemma of the Croatian citizen earning 10 million 
Croatian dinars a month asking: "Must I pay tax?" [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] In Bratislava this afternoon, Slovak President 
Michal Kovac received for the first time personally 
representatives of the Hungarian Civic Party [HCP]. Anton Bodis, 
the president's spokesman, will now tell us about the 
preliminary results of that meeting. He is at this moment on the 
other end of the telephone line. Good evening. Can one already 
talk about some specific conclusions from that meeting? 
  [Bodis] Good evening. HCP Chairman Laszlo Nagy briefed the 
president about the proposals, which his party sees as being 
possible ways of improving the position of national minorities 
in Slovakia. 
  The final conclusions will be known as soon as the president 
has studied these proposals in greater detail. The HCP chairman 
also briefed the president about the party's attitude to 
tomorrow's meeting in Komarno. The president voiced the hope 
that the meeting will take place in a calm and 
nonconfrontational tone. 
  Michal Kovac appreciated the realistic and tolerant attitude 
adopted by the HCP to relations between Slovaks and the 
Hungarian national minority, and toward ways of improving them. 
Both sides agreed on the need to outline the national policy of 
the Slovak Republic and ways of implementing it.

  [Text] The Bratislava City Council today discussed the 
appeal issued by the Association of Towns and Villages of Zitny 
Ostrov, as well as the question of to what extent it concerns 
self-administration of the capital city of the Slovak Republic. 
In the statement given today to the Press Agency of the Slovak 
Republic, Bratislava Mayor Peter Kresanek believes, along with 
members of the City Council, that sound reason, responsibility, 
and the interests of all citizens of the Slovak Republic will 
prevail. 
  The City Council appeals to mayors of the Association of 
Towns and Villages of Zitny ostrov with a feeling of regret and 
misgiving that, instead of taking a common approach in pushing 
through self-administrative structures and interests of the 
citizens-voters, they have chosen a path of unrealistic demands 
that do not represent a real interest of the inhabitants of the 
towns and villages of that region. 
  In the statement, Mayor Kresanek and members of the 
Bratislava City Council, addressing their colleagues from the 
Association of Towns and Villages of Zitny ostrov, call for 
well-considered conduct and a fundamental reassessment of the 
course they have taken up to now, which otherwise might lead to 
raising nationalistic passions.

  [Excerpts] Members of local government bodies, mayors, and 
deputies of legislative bodies from southern Slovak met in the 
sports hall in Komarno this afternoon. [passage omitted] Also 
present at the meeting was our Radiozurnal, represented by 
Jarmila Tosecka and Peter Rohac. Despite difficult conditions, 
they have prepared a comprehensive report. [passage omitted] 
  [Tosecka] During the debate, the organizers acquainted the 
participants in the meeting with the open letter addressed to 
the president of the Slovak Republic and the citizens of 
Slovakia: 
  [Begin unidentified voice recording] We are sorry that 
solutions that concern a further intensification and application 
of the principle of self-administration, civic freedoms, and 
human rights in the case of minorities provoke hatred, 
intolerance, and political arrogance. The state belongs to each 
citizen; no more to some than to others just because they speak 
a different language. Let us seek a path to each other, but on 
the basis of equality. We will find stability only when a 
community will not want to interfere, on the basis of vindicated 
privileges, in a restrictive way, in the rights of another 
group. We are convinced that democracy is indivisible. It is 
either for everyone, or it will cease to be democracy. As 
citizens of the Slovak Republic, we hope that you will 
understand our sincere endeavor to achieve more democracy for 
all citizens of Slovakia because only from them any sovereignty 
arises. [end recording] 
  [Tosecka] All those present approved by acclamation the 
final 
statement issued by the participants in the Komarno meeting. It 
is divided into three parts. [passage omitted] The first part 
contains a statement on the territorial administrative 
reorganization of Slovakia, and I quote: The participants in the 
meeting state that the present system of public administration 
in the Slovak Republic does not tally either with European 
requirements or the demands of the local population. Since 1990, 
the government has been planning a reorganization of the public 
administration system. The participants declare first that the 
government proposal does not suit the majority of the local 
government bodies in Slovakia and is unacceptable to the 
Hungarian community because the area in which the Hungarian 
community lives will, according to that proposal, be divided 
into five territorial administrative units that would promote 
organized assimilation. 
  Second, in setting up administrative areas and organs of 
state administration, it is necessary to proceed from the 
principle that will ensure that the law prevails, and from a 
two-tier system of public administration. In our view, there 
exists two possibilities of reaching a solution--that is, to 
form one continuous territorial administrative unit, a region, 
stretching from the territory south of Bratislava up to Kosice, 
broken by a corridor, and then continuing to include Juzny 
Zemplin and the area between Uh and Latorica; furthermore, to 
create three territorial administrative units, regions, 
stretching from Bratislava to Sahy, from Sahy to Kosice, and 
then Juzny Zemplin and the area between Uh and Latorica. The 
Hungarian language island south of Nitra should form an 
individual area that would consist of 18 villages with almost 
13,000 inhabitants of Hungarian nationality. 
  Furthermore, the opportunity should be embodied in the law 
of 
bilingual dealings both in verbal and written form with official 
matters at offices, within the framework of territorial 
administrative units of the first and second tier, endowed with 
particular powers. 
  Further, from the viewpoint of authorities and powers, the 
system of institutions within the framework of territorial 
administrative units should be compatible throughout the 
territory of Slovakia, with the exception of the territories 
inhabited by Hungarians or members of other national minorities. 
These territories should have a special legal status. 
  Second, there is the statement on the jurisdiction of local 
government bodies. The participants in the meeting state that, 
in the Slovak Republic, the rights of local government bodies 
are inadequate. The development of local government bodies meets 
with obstacles. Their rights are deliberately restricted. 
Central power is getting more powerful, to the detriment of 
local government bodies, and the superiority of state 
administrative bodies is asserted against them. For this reason, 
the Slovak Republic should sign, as soon as possible, an 
association agreement with the European Charter of Local 
Government Bodies, and it should embody the rights of local 
government bodies in the Constitution and the law. Furthermore, 
the vast majority of public matters should be tackled at a local 
level. 
  I can quote, furthermore, the right of local governing 
bodies 
to form associations and their right to join international 
associations. In the interest of legal certainty, the 
Constitution should define for taxation purposes the system of 
local government bodies, their authority, and their powers. 
Before the implementation of the new system of the territorial 
administrative division of the country, within the sense of 
Section Two of Article 64 of the Slovak Constitution, it is 
necessary to create, on the basis of a voluntary association of 
local government bodies, larger territorial units that would 
come under the jurisdiction of future territorial self-governing 
bodies, while paying regard to the recommendation of the Council 
of Europe No. 1201. In the interest of the decentralization of 
power, the rationalization of state administration, and the 
strengthening of public accountability by transferring powers 
from the state administration organs to local government bodies, 
it is necessary to bring administration closer to citizens and 
to broaden constitutional powers of local government bodies, in 
particular in the field of education, culture, health, public 
security, and environmental protection. 
  Third, there is the statement on the constitutional status 
of 
Hungarians. The participants in the meeting state that the 
Hungarian population in Slovakia, despite a number of repressive 
acts and oppression during the totalitarian regime after World 
War II and other attempts to bring about ethnical homogenization 
of the population, has preserved its capacity to express itself 
again as a political entity, organize its community, and 
preserve the original population structure on the lands where it 
has been living for the past thousand years and, in the majority 
of cases, where it forms a majority of the local population. 
[passage omitted] ...as a national community, it fights with 
resolve to ensure that, apart from individual rights to which 
everyone has the right, community rights are also acknowledged 
to it and that its status as a community is embodied in the 
Constitution. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Over 2,000 people, many more than planned, took 
part in the Komarno mass rally of Zitny Ostrov. [passage 
omitted] Evelyn Forro has sent a report from the scene: 
  [Begin recording] [Forro] [passage omitted] The Hungarian 
nationality community in Slovakia considers it indispensable to 
its development that its members be able to use their mother 
tongue where 10 percent of the population is Hungarian, and 
Hungarian should be an official language, together with Slovak, 
where they are in the majority. [passage omitted] 
  At the news conference following the rally, Komarno Mayor 
Istvan Pasztor said they are patient. They wish to hold 
discussions. If these do not succeed, they will wait for the 
next parliament. 
  At the session, the Hungarian nationality representative of 
the Party of the Democratic Left proposed a supplement to the 
stance--namely, that the participants should declare that no 
danger whatsoever threatens Slovak autonomy, sovereignty, and 
the borders. This proposal was not taken into consideration. In 
answer to my question at the news conference, the mayor said the 
reason they did not vote on it was that, in their view, these 
points, in a different formulation, have figured in the stance. 
  The participants of the Komarno meeting have asked the 
Council of Europe to mediate between the Slovak Government and 
the Hungarian minority. [end recording]

  [Text] According to preliminary data, the Slovak state 
budget for 1993 ended in a 22 billion koruna deficit. Julius 
Toth, deputy prime minister and finance minister, said at a 
meeting of the government's economic council that the Cabinet 
had to tackle some problems and release some finances at the end 
of the year. Expenses in health service and education had risen 
considerably, and this resulted in an increase of the overall 
budget deficit. 
  With regard to the unfavourable result of 1993 payments with 
the Czech Republic, Julius Toth said that Slovakia's negative 
balance was caused by pre-Christmas imports from the Czech 
Republic.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bulgarian Minister of Defense Valentin </F>
Aleksandrov by Sevda Shishmanova on 10 January; place not given 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Our reporter Sevda Shishmanova asked 
Bulgaria's Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov about his views 
on the latest initiative of the NATO leaders at their summit in 
Brussels. 
  [Aleksandrov] The Partnership for Peace lays the foundation 
for the European armed forces' integration. 
  [Shishmanova] Yes, but it does not provide any guarantees 
for our defense. 
  [Aleksandrov] Look here, guarantees can be provided (?only 
by the state institutions). There are no other guarantees. Who 
is going to attack us? Greece, Turkey, or Romania? You must 
realize yourself that this is preposterous. This cannot happen. 
  [Shishmanova] Nevertheless, there is a war, in Yugoslavia. 
  [Aleksandrov] The Army can cope with this. You should 
understand that guarantees of the kind that the Soviet Union 
used to provide can no longer be obtained. There is no one to 
provide them. 
  [Shishmanova] Perhaps NATO. 
  [Aleksandrova] Whom should it provide guarantees for? 
  [Shishmanova] Evidently, not for us. 
  [Aleksandrova] Yes, evidently not for us, (?hence we should 
adopt other models). 
  [Shishmanova] In that case, what is the Partnership for 
Peace doing for us? 
  [Aleksandrov] It is a serious [words indistinct] for our 
defense. [several words indistinct] The so-called Visegard Four 
member-states are not pleased, because they will not join NATO 
before us. 
  [Shishmanova] Yes, but Clinton is expected to meet their 
leaders, rather than ours. 
  [Aleksandrov] This is Clinton's business, it is none of my 
concern. I am neither president, nor prime minister, I am 
minister of defense. However, I must tell you frankly my point 
of view, which I have repeatedly stated, namely that none of 
those countries is ahead of us, and I should point out that we 
see considerable opportunities in the NATO program that we 
intend to take full advantage of.

  [Text] The traditional New Year reception given by 
President Dr. Zhelev for the diplomatic corps took place at the 
Boyana Residence today. 
  In greeting the diplomats, Dr. Zhelev expressed his 
confidence that, as in the past, also in 1994, their benevolence 
and good intentions toward Bulgaria are likely to contribute to 
our country's efforts for international support. Bulgarian 
democracy has reached the middle of its first seven years and is 
still expected to accomplish a great deal, but the path of 
changes that Bulgaria embarked upon four years ago is 
irreversible, the president assured his audience. 
  Mr. Zhelev recalled the essence of Bulgaria's international 
policy and its Balkan policy in particular, which is aimed at 
building lasting good neighborly and mutually advantageous 
relations. 
  Dwelling on the forthcoming summit meeting of the NATO 
member-states scheduled for 10 January 1994, the Bulgarian head 
of state pointed out our country's stand of principle, according 
to which it is striving to join NATO after the North Atlantic 
bloc has, possibly, decided to expand.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Georgi Apostolov: "Bulgaria Relegated to </F>
Third Echelon"] 
  [Text] The meeting of the Visegrad Four in Warsaw produced 
an unexpected but not surprising result -- the Four became a 
"Three Plus One." 
  The Czech Republic decided to act alone on its admission to 
NATO after it realized that Moscow would hardly lift its veto 
over the admission of its close neighbors, such as Poland, to 
the North Atlantic Organization. It is very possible that 
Hungary would follow the Czech example. On the other hand, 
Slovakia, just like Poland, is not one of the favorites, because 
of its weaker economic development. 
  Against the background of those developments the Czech 
Republic and Hungary form the first echelon of the candidates, 
Slovakia and Poland the second, while the other East European 
countries, outside the Visegrad four, will naturally remain in 
the third position. The irony of this development is that the 
new U.S. diplomatic vocabulary appeared to be completely 
opposite to the reality. Justifying its retreat from the 
previously expressed readiness to expand NATO toward the East, 
Washington adopted the "avoiding a new division in Europe" 
expression. Under this euphemism one understands an 
unwillingness to admit to NATO the East European states that are 
close to Russia in order to not isolate Moscow. However, in 
practice this attitude led toward two new divisions. In 
addition to the old division into East and Central Europe, now 
there is a "first central group" -- the Czech Republic and 
Hungary, and a "second central group" -- Slovakia and Poland. 
  For the time being Bulgaria is in the third echelon. 
However, while the Bulgarian politicians continue to place 
their bets on the group principle, which has already failed, 
possible new divisions are possible, which will push Bulgaria 
even more toward the back of the line.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ivan G. Ivanov: "Hasten Cleverly, but Not </F>
Slowly"] 
  [Text] The Ministry of Industry has made a request to 
dismantle and sell 200 enterprises that have accumulated 10.89 
percent of the total uncollectable debts in the industrial 
sector. The tripartite commission is insisting on closing down 
firms that have leased out more than half their property in the 
present financial impasse. 
  For years on end, our politicians and rulers have watched 
with mixed feelings while the state economy sinks into a sea of 
problems. They hastened slowly, and did absolutely nothing. 
Finally, unemployment has gone through the ceiling, reaching 
21.4 percent, not including those on unpaid leave. In the state 
industry alone, bad debts have reached monstrous dimensions -- 
almost 13 percent of the GDP of 501 billion leva that the 
government is budgeting for this year. 
  Only now have they got busy, because a market economy cannot 
be made without a market, and the simplest definition of a 
"market" is a place where someone sells something and someone 
else buys it. In Bulgaria this second "someone" is looking 
around a great deal, but buying little. His cash funds are 
mainly dependent on the state sector. However, because no one 
is buying anything, everyone is making losses without exception. 
  The general flurry of activity is giving rise to chaos. At 
the end of 1993, parliament failed to realize how many laws were 
needed before the bad debt problem can be settled. Now at 
last, they are proposing extremely painful and now unavoidable 
"surgical" measures that will be very difficult to implement. 
The country lacks coordination, a legislative base, and budget 
funds. 
  Cannot the authorities and the politicians hasten 
intelligently?

  [Text] After Krsko nuclear power station is reconnected to 
the Slovene energy system -- this is expected within 24 hours -- 
Croatia will not longer receive electricity from Krsko. In 
Zagreb, they assessed this measure of the Slovene Economic 
Ministry as an unprecedented ultimatum and called for 
negotiations. Irena Majce reports: 
  [Begin Majce recording] Minister Dr. Maks Tajnikar, 
therefore, kept his promise. His pronouncement that after this 
synchronization Croatia will no longer receive electricity from 
Krsko is about to materialize in the next few hours. At least, 
this is what the minister asserted this morning. 
  The station is expected to receive the final permission for 
operation today. Following the second request of the power 
station regarding the modification of chlorine detection, the 
Republican Directorate for Nuclear Safety concluded that the 
problem could be temporarily resolved by two hand-operated 
portable monitors. The ordered and already paid for automatic 
sensors are expected to arrive in Krsko within six to eight 
weeks. By extending another two decrees until the halt this 
summer, the power station now meets the conditions to resume 
operation. It is expected that it will operate normally, that 
is to say, it will gradually, with interim tests, reach its 100 
percent capacity. 
  Half of the electricity, that is, over 7 million kwh per 
day, 
that Krsko has so far produced for Croatia will now be partially 
used at home while the rest will be exported abroad, that is, to 
those who will pay for it. 
  Minister Tajnikar communicated this in a special letter to 
his Croatian colleague last week and added that the neighboring 
country will be able to get electricity again after 26 January, 
but only on the condition that it settles its debts by 19 
January. 
  Zagreb, in its letter to Ljubljana today, replied that such 
a 
measure, which they call an ultimatum, could have grave 
political and material consequences. They, therefore, reject 
it, with the proposal that all open questions connected to the 
nuclear power station be negotiated between the states in a 
package, and not merely the finances. 
  Minister Tajnikar reiterated today that Slovenia will insist 
on payment for electricity and that it is initially willing to 
negotiate on finances only, and on other questions once the 
financial issues are settled. Most of other issues are 
supposedly already regulated by Slovene legislation, with the 
exception of property transformation, regarding which the 
government has not taken a stance yet. 
  Croatian Energy Secretary Vladimir Kramberger believes that 
the problem lies precisely in property transformation because he 
believes that Slovenia is avoiding the preparation of new 
interstate documents about the power station because it would 
like to take it over entirely. 
  Croatia still owes 38 million German Marks to Krsko, after 
it 
has paid altogether 2 million German Marks on Friday and Monday. 
Slovenia has settled all of its obligations prior to this change 
of fuel. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["C. R."-signed report: "VOMO Director Andrej Lovsin </F>
Resigns"] 
  [Text] Ljubljana 6 January -- Andrej Lovsin today stopped 
working as the director of the Security Organ of the Defense 
Ministry [VOMO]. At his own request, the government at today's 
session relieved him of his duty as undersecretary in the 
Defense Ministry, a statement by the Defense Ministry says. 
  Lovsin started his military career in the former Yugoslavia 
as an officer of the Yugoslav Peoples' Army. Upon his release 
from the Yugoslav Peoples' Army in 1985 he took up employment in 
the Slovene Secretariat for Internal Affairs, and after 
independence in June 1991, took up the post of the chief of the 
military intelligence service. Under his leadership the service 
rather successfully dodged parliamentary supervision, while 
Lovsin himself was involved in the controversial kidnapping of 
two Greek arms merchants in Austria. 
  The failure and disclosure of this action gave rise to hints 
about VOMO's encroachment upon the authorities of the civilian 
intelligence service and its appetites for control over the 
civilian sphere, which led to the affair of VIS 
[Security-Information Service] versus VOMO. On that occasion, 
Lovsin offered his resignation from the post of the chief of the 
military intelligence service for the first time, however, 
Defense Minister Janez Jansa did not accept it. Lately, 
Lovsin's name again rocked the public in connection with the 
B.P. case, that is to say, the affair involving the Adit and 
Safti [companies].

  [Text] In connection with the NATO summit session held in 
Brussels, Mr. Petre Roman, president of the Democratic Party, 
president of the Commission for Defense, Public Order, and 
National Security in the Chamber of Deputies, and special 
rapporteur of the NATO Assembly for the new European security 
order, made a statement to our radio network in which he 
mentioned that the proceedings have concluded without any 
surprise. 
  The U.S. plan of partnership for peace was adopted. For the 
countries that belonged to the former Warsaw Pact, among them 
Romania, this can be considered as a disappointing result. 
Romania can consider itself a country that deserves to have a 
more reassuring status for its own national security. 
  Mr. Roman also said that the plan for partnership for peace 
represents a compromise between the direct request of the former 
socialist countries to be accepted in NATO and Russia's 
insistent demand not to have such an expansion of that 
organization.

  [Text] During today's news conference of the Democratic 
Convention of Romania [CDR], CDR Chairman Emil Constantinescu 
presented the stance of that political alliance with respect to 
the evolution of the domestic political affairs over the past 
weeks, our correspondent, Iulia Gherman, reports. 
  After emphasizing the fact that, owing to the self-willed 
and 
rigid stance adopted by the ruling coalition, the political 
dialogue is currently blocked, Constantinescu pointed out that 
there are only two ways to overcome this situation, namely 
either the establishment of a new parliamentary majority or the 
holding of early elections. Talking about the first alternative, 
he asserted that the CDR will solely participate in the 
government together with the Social Democracy Party of Romania 
[PDSR] if the latter political grouping gets rid of the 
extremist parties and adopts a concrete anticrisis program. 
Related to the issue of holding early elections, Constantinescu 
said that this represents a constitutional and democratic method 
to solve the crisis caused by the lack of confidence in the 
current state power. If that solution will be really selected, 
that will be a direct consequence of the policy totally lacking 
imagination that is being promoted by the ruling party and its 
allies. 
  Constantinescu mentioned the fact that, tomorrow, the CDR 
Executive Council will meet in a conference to debate issues 
related to the current political, economic, and social situation 
in the country in view of the talks that are to be held on 
Tuesday [11 January] at Cotroceni Palace among President Ion 
Iliescu and CDR leaders.

  [Text] A government delegation headed by Mircea Cosea, 
state minister and chairman of the Council for Economic 
Coordination, Strategy, and Reform, will pay an official visit 
to China on 10-18 January upon the invitation of the Chinese 
Committee for Economic Restructuring. 
  Shortly before his departure, the head of the Romanian 
Government delegation made the following statement to our 
correspondents: 
  [Begin Cosea recording] We are leaving for a visit to the 
People's Republic of China. Our delegation consists principally 
of members of Romania's Council for Reform, but some delegates 
of the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Industry have 
also joined us. The visit is being made upon the invitation our 
council received from China's Committee for Economic 
Restructuring. We will have the honor of being received by 
China's prime minister and vice president. Practically every 
day, we will be able to meet with ministers and important 
personalities involved in China's reform. 
  For us, this visit represents a very interesting element, 
because as everyone knows, the Chinese experiment has been a 
success. We are not interested in duplicating the Chinese 
model; such a thing would be impossible, as the structure and 
grandeur of that country compels us to observe the proportions. 
However, the key elements of the way in which their new 
economic apparatus and market economy was conceived might be 
used by us as well. We could use certain elements that our 
Chinese friends resorted to in the southern part of their 
country, in building up a very large potential for exports there 
and in attracting foreign capital. Therefore, this visit may be 
regarded as a trip to accumulate experience and training in view 
of the Romanian reform. 
  I would also like to mention another important element of 
our 
visit, and that is the revival of the economic and political 
relations between China and Romania. This is to be a government 
visit, and the Chinese Government considers it as an event that 
could give impetus to the relations between Romania and China. 
China has become an economic world power and forecasts show that 
over the next 10 years, it will become one of the most important 
economic powers in the world. In my opinion, Romania should be 
very interested in not just profiting from that country's 
experience, but also in keeping close relations to that Asian 
area where such development is taking place and where we are 
interested and able to engage in exchanges and cooperation.

  [Text] Belgrade, January 10 (TANJUG) -- The sanctions 
imposed by the international community against the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia do not help restore peace in the former 
Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and secure an equal 
treatement for all the three confronted sides there, Prime 
Minister of the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia Nikola Sainovic said 
on Monday [10 January]. He said this during talks with three 
British MPs who are currently visiting Yugoslavia and the 
Bosnian Serb republic, the Republican Ministry of Information 
said in a statement. 
  In May 1992, the United Nations Security Council imposed 
tough sanctions against the Yugoslav republics of Serbia and 
Montenegro because of their alleged involvement in the civil war 
among Moslems, Serbs and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 
allegation that only Serbia is responsible for the war in Bosnia 
is not correct, one of the British MPs, Nigel Evans, said in an 
interview to Serbian Television after the meeting with Sainovic. 
He also said he would present this view to the British 
Government. 
  The talks focused on the effects of the sanctions and the 
possibilities for unhindered and speedier delivery of British 
humanitarian medical supplies to Yugoslavia, he said. We are 
especially interested in working in that direction after our 
visits to hospitals where we saw the effects of the sanctions, 
Evans said.

  [Text] Belgrade, 10 Jan (TANJUG) -- The federal government 
met today and discussed and passed a decree on providing 
temporary financing for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for 
the period of January-March 1994, the federal Ministry of 
Information reports in a statement. The session was chaired by 
Deputy Prime Minister Zeljko Simic. 
  As the conditions have not been fulfilled for this year's 
federal budget to be adopted by the Federal Assembly by the end 
of the year, and in order not to threaten the most vital 
functions of the federal state, the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia Government passed an act on a temporary budget for 
the first quarter of the year. 
  This will make it possible to secure resources to finance 
the 
work of the Army of Yugoslavia and the fedaral administration 
bodies, pay war veteran's pensions and social security, provide 
social security for refugees and for the population on the 
territories under the control of the UN peacekeeping forces, the 
statement says.

Prime Minister Dr. Radoje Kontic received Konstantin 
Gorokostapulos [name as received], head of the EU observer 
mission for the former Yugoslavia, who took over this post on 1 
January. During the meeting it was stressed that it is vital to 
do everything to end the conflicts in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina peacefully as soon as possible. It was 
pointed out that the EU mission could play a significant role in 
this connection, above all by interpreting events in the area of 
the former Yugoslavia objectively. To this end the Federal 
Government and federal bodies will offer all necessary 
assistance to the EU mission. 
  Interest was expressed on both sides in the closest possible 
cooperation between the Federal Government and federal organs 
and the EU mission, the statement of the Federal Information 
Ministry says in conclusion.

  [Text] Zoran Djindjic, chairman of the Executive Committee 
of the Democratic Party, stated that the new government of 
Serbia will not be formed, even though a compromise is possible, 
and that one should expect new elections to be called soon. 
Speaking at a news conference, he also said that the rift in 
the party will soon be resolved with the vote of no confidence 
in Dragoljub Micunovic, president of the Democratic Party. 
Srdjan Savic reports: 
  [Savic] The meeting of the Main Committee of the Democratic 
Party was interrupted early this morning because there was no 
quorum during the casting of the vote of confidence in the party 
president, Dragoljub Micunovic, Djindjic said. The session of 
the Main Committee will be resumed on Saturday [15 January] at 
which members will not make speeches, but only hold a vote of 
confidence in the party's president. The convening of the 
conference of the Democratic Party will also be on the agenda. 
There is no danger of yet another Democratic Party being 
formed, Djindjic said, stressing that the dispute with Micunovic 
is not personal and that they only have conceptual differences. 
  The president of the Executive Committee of the Democrats 
holds the view that the political life in Serbia represents the 
continuation of a chaos, that wages and pensions are not being 
paid because of the shortage of cash, and that the German mark 
is becoming the main unit of account. According to him, all 
this is being induced by the Government of the Republic of 
Serbia. 
  Djindjic stressed that the Democratic Party will not enter 
the government formed by the Socialists. He said that 
Sainovic's government will remain in office until the next 
elections, which should be expected soon. A compromise is 
nevertheless possible, and the next move should be made by 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and the Socialist Party of 
Serbia, Zoran Djindjic concluded.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Zoran Petrov: "Just a Strategic </F>
Determination"] 
  [Text] More than six months have passed since the 
Macedonian Government made its first official announcement on 
the possibility of joining NATO, along with the information that 
a request for admission to this military alliance was being 
sent. At that time, this piece of news was largely commented on 
because, as some military experts and defense theoreticians have 
emphasized, the security of the republic would be highly 
promoted with such an action. Since that time, the public has 
not been given any further official information about the fate 
of this initiative -- whether the government ever discussed NATO 
membership again, whether the request for admission to the NATO 
Council was sent to Brussels, what the response was, or, in 
general, what the possibilities and chances are for Macedonia to 
join the treaty. In the meantime, a number of extremely 
important events occurred in Macedonia, which, in a way, 
overshadowed the NATO membership initiative. First, it was the 
arrival of the U.S. squadron from Berlin, which was placed under 
the command of UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces] in 
Macedonia, acting as a historical precedent to the previous 
practice of UN peacekeeping forces. 
  More importantly though is that, since May of last year, 
visits by U.S. political and army representatives have become 
more frequent -- Congressmen Reid and Gingrich, Senators Lugar 
and Coverdell, the congressional delegation headed by 
Congressman Skelton, and several high army delegations. The 
whole matter was finally made official on 3 December with the 
opening of the U.S. Liaison Office in Skopje. 
<H5>  Expanded Mandate of the "Yankee" </H5>
  The initiative for NATO membership has now been actualized 
by 
President Kiro Gligorov, who announced it as a strategic goal 
for this year in his pre-New Year address in the Macedonian 
Parliament. On the other hand, great attention was drawn to a 
statement made by UNPROFOR Commander Fin Saermark Thompsen a 
couple of months ago. Talking about the mission of the "blue 
helmets" in Macedonia and reiterating once again that their 
basic task was to observe and inform about everything that was 
happening on the Macedonian-Serbian border, accidentally or not, 
Thompsen stated that only the newly arrived U.S. soldiers in 
Macedonia had the right to resort to arms under his personal 
command. This practically means that the mandate of the 
peacekeeping forces has been exposed to changes, and even though 
the Nordic Battalion, as has been stated so many times before, 
has been excluded from any armed intervention, the same is not 
applied to the Americans either. Therefore, regardless of their 
symbolic number (approximately 300), the U.S. squadron that is 
operating under the flag of the United Nations in Macedonia has 
the right to not only observe and inform about what is happening 
on the border, but it also disposes of a "somewhat" expanded 
mandate regarding the mission. 
  This indicator bluntly coincides with the increased interest 
in Macedonia by the United States, which started in May last 
year, after Bill Clinton stated that the United States would get 
involved in military actions in case Macedonia is attacked. In 
other words, the predictions about a discrete change in the 
UNPROFOR mandate and the expectations that the size of the U.S. 
contingent will soon be increased have been actualized. 
  The fact that the Bosnian conflict cannot be hidden by a 
glass bell and that its expansion cannot be impeded because one 
of the most natural characteristics of every war is its 
metastasis is the cause for Macedonia, whether it likes it or 
not, to be involved in the geographic and strategic maps as a 
region of high risk, gravitating objectively toward the shaking 
Bosnian region. In other words, Macedonia is a part of the 
general situation that is defined as unstable and unpredictable 
on the global plan and the expanded definition of the total 
situation in the boiling Balkans. Here we can look for the root 
of the sudden interest in Macedonia by the Americans, who 
clearly exposed their intentions in the whole region after 
entering the game as a military factor for solving the Bosnian 
conflict. Thus, the United States has, once again, not only 
demonstrated its resoluteness in realizing its fundamental 
interest in keeping a strategic stability in these regions, but 
also, as is usually pointed out by Western Europeans, because of 
"the fact that history has thrice taught us that the permanent 
presence of the United States in Europe is essentially desirable 
and fruitful." On the other hand, it is known that the initial 
urges of the Americans for a military intervention in the former 
Yugoslavia were met by strong reaction from the European allies, 
because the Americans themselves refuse to subordinate any part 
of their armed forces under the UN command. Here is where the 
present latent disunity between the previous allies lies, which 
is slowly and discretely affecting the exposed attempts for 
redefining the structures, goals, and authorities of the 
previously untouchable NATO. 
<H5>  The Smallest Evil Selected </H5>
  It is certain that the Macedonian leadership has thought 
about all the possible alternatives and consequences in the 
greater cooperation with the United States. 
  The U.S. military presence in our country is the third 
solution of the dilemma -- how to locate the security of 
Macedonia: whether to connect it with some of the neighbors by 
creating a military alliance (a dangerous alternative that would 
radically increase the pressures and aspirations toward our 
country) or to make up for the enormous lack in armament after 
the departure of the former Yugoslav National Army relying on 
its own forces (not only objectively, impossible alternative, 
but also in direct collision with the arms import embargo). 
Therefore, the only possibility left is to cooperate with a 
military force, which -- emphasized by our state officials so 
many times before -- does not have any historical aspirations 
toward this region -- in other words, the United States. 
  As a matter of fact, in accepting the U.S. offer to send 
its troops, Macedonia has chosen the best solution, which 
certainly should not be treated as a complete guarantee for 
peace and stability in the country. This process will be 
thoroughly encompassed if Macedonia officially states its 
request and is admitted as a member of NATO. However, for the 
time being, the public has not been informed about such an 
action, although it is known that the Macedonian foreign 
minister has paid several visits to the NATO headquarters in 
Brussels. As a consequence, if we follow the recent steps of 
"refrain" and the gradual penetration of Macedonia into all 
international institutions and bodies, accompanied by its recent 
recognition by a great number of EU members, it is logical to 
expect that in this phase of the military plan, the main 
emphasis will be placed on the U.S. military presence in the 
state. 
  From a purely military aspect, the interest of the United 
States and NATO originates from the geographical and 
topographical definition of the central part of the Vardar 
corridor and certainly from the aspect of maintaining peace in 
the region. Here lie the clearly defined interests of a number 
of states for the former Yugoslav republics; therefore, 
Macedonia, directly or indirectly, has found itself in one of 
the zones defined as the sphere of U.S. interest and influence 
(together with Albania, Bulgaria, and certainly, Greece). In 
any case, it would be too ambitious and unreal to claim that 
Macedonia has definitely been placed under the U.S. umbrella. 
All the guarantees and elementary presumptions for safeguarding 
peace and security lie within Macedonia itself, in keeping its 
internal stability, particularly on the plan of interethnic 
relations and social peace.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Prime Minister Bukoshi Urges NATO To </F>
Act on Kosova" -- issued by the Democratic League of Kosova] 
  [Text] As the NATO Summit is due to convene today, prime 
minister of the republic of Kosova Dr. Bujar Bukoshi wrote a 
letter yesterday to the Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco 
Silva bringing to his attention "the continuing state of 
turmoil, human rights violations, and repression in the republic 
of Kosova," and requesting NATO to consider four specific 
actions while addressing the Kosova crisis. 
  "Without a prompt resolution of the Kosova problem and 
without an end to the abrogation of all human, civil, and 
national rights of the Albanians in Kosova, the Balkans will 
ultimately face the serious possibility of a devastating 
conflict which would not only obstruct the new NATO Partnership 
for Peace initiative, but would also affect the present 
structure of NATO itself," says the letter, asking NATO use its 
influence to: redeploy international human rights monitors to 
Kosova; send peacekeeping forces to the region; keep 
international pressure on Serbia; and bring the perpetrators of 
crimes against humanity to justice. 
  This letter together with a statement of the Kosova prime 
minister elaborating the need for action on Kosova were sent to 
all NATO-member heads of governments in Brussels. 
  Dr. Bujar Bukoshi said in the statement that "without a just 
solution to the Kosova problem, there can be no comprehensive 
settlement of the brutally aggressive Balkan conflict," adding 
that unless it is addressed as an international problem, it will 
"lead inevitably to an international conflict which will demand 
international action." 
  Prime minister Bukoshi offers a comprehensive account of the 
deteriorating situation in Kosova following the expulsion of 
Serbia of the CSCE mission to Kosova. 
  In face of the alarming situation in Kosova, prime minister 
Bukoshi urges NATO summit to consider four specific actions to 
address the problem "realistically and effectively." One is the 
redeployment of the international human rights monitors to 
Kosova, in compliance with the UN Security Council's resolution 
adopted last August. Second, Kosova prime minister asks for UN 
or NATO peacekeeping forces to be deployed in Kosova in order to 
avoid a massive bloodshed in face of the heavy Serbian military, 
paramilitary, and police build-up. Third, Dr. Bukoshi maintains 
that the "economic sanctions against Serbia must be kept in 
place," although as he says, "the people of Kosova suffer on two 
counts" from sanctions imposed on Kosova by Serbia itself and

  [passage indistinct] the perpetrators of crimes against 
humanity to justice. "Prompt and decisive action by the United 
Nations War Crimes Tribunal will do much to teach the criminal 
aggressors that such gross crimes against humanity will not go 
unpunished," says Dr. Bukoshi in his today's statement, adding 
that "failed policies of the past are no excuse for the failure 
to act in the present. The means to avert a Kosova calamity are 
clear. All that remains in the will of NATO and the 
international community to act."

  [Text] Belgrade, Jan 10 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic on Monday [10 January] warned that a NATO 
threat to launch air strikes to lift the siege of Sarajevo could 
jeopardize the overall peace process for the region. 
  His comments came as North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
leaders, meeting at a summit in Brussels, discussed the 
possibility of renewing their threat of air strikes, originally 
made last year. 
  In a statement to the Bosnian Serb SRNA news agency, he 
warned against an "anti-Serb resolution" by NATO, saying that 
air strikes would only create "new difficulties." In particular 
he said that if NATO agreed to any resolution "against the 
Serbs" they would be forced to review territorial offers to 
Bosnian Moslems -- a key factor in the overall peace settlement. 
  "We offered 33.3 percent of the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to the Moslems, and accepted under certain 
conditions that Sarajevo be put under UN administration," he 
said. Karadzic said that, of the three warring sides, Bosnian 
Serbs had "proved to be the most cooperative." 
  He once again blamed the international community for the 
crisis in former Yugoslavia, saying it "would do nothing but 
continue its series of mistakes" if it continued to press its 
"anti-Serb" policies.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 10 Jan (TANJUG) -- President of the Srpska 
republic Radovan Karadzic received in Pale today the newly 
appointed head of UNPROFOR for the former Yugoslavia, the 
Japanese diplomat Yasushi Akashi. 
  Nikola Koljevic, the deputy president of the Srpska 
republic; 
Belgian General Francis Briquemont, UNPROFOR commander for the 
former Bosnia-Hercegovina; and Sergio Vieira de Mello, the UN 
secretary general's special envoy, also took part in the talks. 
  After the talks, both sides expressed satisfaction and hope 
that today's constructive dialogue on humanitarian problems and 
the ways to resolve the Bosnian crisis would stimulate the peace 
process and speed up the efforts which are being made to ensure 
the respect of obligations which have been undertaken, 
particularly regarding the observations of cease-fires.

<F P=106> [Report by Slobodan Kovacevic] </F>
  [Text] After his visits to Zagreb and Sarajevo, Yoshimo 
Akashi, special UN envoy and the newly appointed coordinator of 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], accompanied by General 
Briquemont, is currently visiting Pale. Talks with the president 
and the vice president of the Srpska republic Radovan Karadzic 
and Nikola Koljevic, respectively, are under way. Slobodan 
Kovacevic reports: 
  [Kovacevic] The first meeting between the special envoy, Mr. 
Akashi, and the leaders of the Srpska republic was held, as we 
were told, in an atmosphere characterized by mutual 
understanding. All dilemmas and claims about Akashi allegedly 
not being able to arrive in Pale were clarified at the very 
beginning. 
  Mr. Akashi expressed concern about the current position of 
UNPROFOR in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and the increasingly 
frequent attacks on the Blue Helmets. He also demanded greater 
guarantees from the Serbs for the transit of humanitarian 
convoys, as well as the free movement of civilians. He promised 
that UNPROFOR will do everything possible for Sarajevo airport 
to indeed be used for humanitarian purposes. 
  Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska republic, told 
Akashi and Briquemont that the Serbian side could accept 
Sarajevo being placed under the UN protectorate under certain 
conditions, provided that a cease-fire, that is, imminent peace, 
be established immediately. Karadzic also expressed assurances 
that such meetings with top UNPROFOR representatives will be 
more frequent so that the Serbian side and UNPROFOR establish 
trust, especially regarding Sarajevo airport. 
  Karadzic briefly told journalists that Akashi and Briquemont 
confirmed that Sarajevo airport will in the future indeed be 
used only for humanitarian purposes and for the needs of the 
United Nations. 
  Let us also say that a regular session of the assembly of 
the 
Srpska republic is also being held here in Pale. The agenda 
includes numerous issues regarding the internal organization of 
the Srpska republic. A particularly important discussion, and 
perhaps the adoption of a special document on the continuation 
of the peace negotiations in Geneva, is expected late in the 
afternoon.

  [Interview with Radovan Karadzic, president of the republic 
of Srpska, by Slobodan Kovacevic; place and date not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Kovacevic] Mr. President, you have briefed the 
deputies about the course of the peace talks to date. Is the 
Serbian side changing anything in the platform for the 
continuation of the talks in Geneva? 
  [Karadzic] For the time being we are not changing anything. 
We do not wish to add to any sort of confusion in hope that a 
peaceful solution will be found. We will leave it until the 
18th [January], perhaps the 17th, or perhaps even after the 
18th, in order to orient ourselves toward the future situation 
that will result from the Muslim-Croatian talks. 
  I would like to say that we have nothing against the 
Izetbegovic-Tudjman meeting in Bonn if this will contribute 
toward their reconciliation, which would help the overall peace 
in the entire Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, if Germany tries to 
reconciliate the Muslims and the Croats and turn them against 
the Serbs, we will oppose this, naturally. For this reason we 
do not wish to contribute to any sort of disruption of the 
constructive atmosphere and will wait to see how the events 
develop.

  [Text] Obrenovac, 11 Jan (TANJUG) -- We welcome the 
decisions of the Atlantic alliance which, despite the 
Franco-British initiative to exert pressure on the Serbs, has 
given priority to the negotiating process, Momcilo Krajisnik, 
president of the assembly of the republic of Srpska, told Radio 
Obrenovac today. 
  Although we continue to have a critical stance vis-a-vis 
some 
NATO moves, we do not conceal our satisfaction at the fact that 
the "Sixteen" in Brussels have advocated negotiations -- 
something we have been in favor of from the very beginning, 
Krajisnik added. 
  He pointed out that the Serb side will continue to reject 
any 
planned resolutions that might imperil the strategic interests 
of the Serbian people. 
  Commenting on the possibility of the withdrawal of the "blue 
helmets" from the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, Krajisnik said that 
UN forces ought to remain until peace is achieved. 
  He added that the Serbs will not protest if the 
peace-keeping 
forces withdraw, because, he added, they have not been 
protecting the Serbs in any case, but the Muslims. 
  He recalled that it was with this protection that the 
Muslims 
had armed themselves. Peace could be achieved more easily and 
quickly, according to Krajisnik, if such support were withheld 
from the Muslims.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 11 January carries in 
its regular 15-minute newscast several reports on the fighting 
in the republic. 
  Reporting on the situation in Sarajevo this morning, the 
studio announcer says that "the general alarm has been sounded 
in the city. Just after 0900 the [Serb] enemy artillery shelled 
the city center. As we have learned from the state hospital, 
two lightly and two seriously wounded citizens have so far been 
brought in, while, according to incomplete information, a number 
of wounded have been brought into the Kosevo hospital. We again 
warn the citizens of the capital to observe all the 
self-protection measures envisaged by the general alarm." 
  The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 3d Corps describes the situation 
in central Bosnia yesterday, adding that "the fighting increased 
the number of killed members of the Vitez HVO so far which, 
according to the official information issued yesterday by the 
HVO operative area of central Bosnia, amounts to 1,504 killed 
fighters over the last six months." 
  In his report from Zavidovici, Viktor Boban says that 
yesterday was a "relatively quiet day, with sporadic fire from 
both aggressors [the Serbs and HVO]. A convoy of the 
aggressor's vehicles was spotted moving last night from the 
direction of (Globanica) to the fronts on the left bank of the 
Bosna River. This morning the enemy is occasionally firing with 
small arms in the Smajlbasici and (Brasljevine) areas." 
  Hamiz Deronjic reports from Brcko that "last night the 
[Serb] 
enemy fired with antiaircraft guns and machine guns along the 
entire front line. Earlier in the evening the aggressor shelled 
(Poderice) with 82-mm mortars, and some 10 82-mm mortars were 
also fired at Jagodnjak. The Lipovac defense lines were pounded 
all night with 120-mm mortars. The aggressor also reinforced 
his lines with men and equipment on this front last night."

  [Text] Sarajevo, Jan 11 (AFP) -- The UNHCR humanitarian 
airlift to Sarajevo resumed on Tuesday morning after a break of 
almost a week because of shelling around the Bosnian capital's 
airport. 
  The first plane to land, an American C-130, touched down at 
0645 GMT, an official for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, 
Kris Janowski, said. 
  He said 21 flights were expected during the day. 
  Usually between 25 and 27 planes daily bring in food, 
medicine and cold weather supplies, according to Captain Joel 
Fouquet, who is in charge of the 250 UN troops controlling the 
airport. 
  The UN Protection Force would like to up that to 40 a day, 
but "the Serbs are opposed to it," Fouquet told a press 
conference. 
  Nearly 90,000 tonnes of supplies have been unloaded from 
more 
than 8,000 flights into Sarajevo since the airlift started, he 
said.

  [Excerpt] After a relatively quiet night, the Muslim army 
began fresh artillery and infantry actions this morning. Ivica 
Saric reports for Croatian radio. 
  [Saric] In addition to the shelling of Vitez, the positions 
of the Croat Defense Council [HVO] in the Buhine Kuce region 
came under fire at 0900. Heavy machine guns are being used in 
the main. The enemy began infantry attacks in the direction of 
the Vitez operational zone at 0930 with the intention of 
restoring control over the buildings it lost yesterday in Buhine 
Kuce. Fierce street fighting and a battle for every house has 
resumed. The defense formations are successfully repelling the 
attacks by the Muslim army. 
  In the Vitez operational zone, they have evidence that in 
yesterday's shelling of Vitez the Muslim army used a type of 
cluster bomb. This refers to mortars which prior to exploding 
release dozens of the notorious bomblets which explode on 
impact. In addition to this, a number of shells which fell on 
Mali Mosunj in the municipality of Vitez were filled with 
chemicals. People felt sick and dizzy and there were visible 
traces of an inky color in those houses which were hit. [passage

  [Text] Bileca, 11 Jan (TANJUG) -- The information service 
of the [Serb] Herzegovina Corps announced this morning that Serb 
fighters last night repelled a strong attack by the Muslim Army 
from the direction of Gorazde on the Nekopi area in the 
municipality of Srbinje (formerly Foca). 
  The same source says that, in addition to light weapons, the 
Muslims used antiaircraft guns and machine guns, as well as 
mortars. 
  The Herzegovina Corps headquarters claims that the "green 
berets" sent a sabotage-terrorist group into the Cajnice region 
yesterday, which was spotted and destroyed in time. 
  On other parts of the Herzegovina battlefield, only 
occasional provocations from light weapons were registered 
yesterday and last night.

<F P=106> [Article by Krystyna Grzybowska from Brussels: "Against a </F>
New Division of Europe"; final three paragraphs attributed to 
M.W.] 
  [Text] On Sunday [9 January] in Brussels, U.S. President 
Clinton warned former communist countries against the possible 
return of dictatorships and presented them with the prospect of 
joining NATO. However, he ruled out the possibility of 
broadening the organization immediately. "We cannot replace old 
divisions with new ones," said Clinton. 
  The speech by the President of the United States was the 
most 
important event on the day before the opening session of the 
North Atlantic Council. It was delivered at a meeting with young 
people in Brussels City Hall. 
  In his 30-minute speech, the President emphasized: Europe is 
the main partner of the United States, but it is not the only 
one. The United States is also linked by partnership to the 
Americas and Asia. 
  Discussing the security of Europe, the President stated that 
it must be constructed on the rules of democracy, free market, 
and civil society. Military security depends on all of these 
factors as well. The President said that Europeans are part of 
the Western European Union, the European Union, the CSCE, and 
the United Nations. However, NATO is the foundation of security. 
  "Partnership for Peace," understood as a process or an 
evolution, is aimed at broadening NATO and opening the door for 
cooperation for all former adversaries, including Russia and 
Ukraine. The U.S. President did not exclude the possibility of 
NATO intervention if peace were jeopardized in Europe. 
  The Final Communique Commission has almost finished working 
on the text of this document. As we could find out in Brussels, 
the most important part of it concerns NATO relations with the 
states of Central and East Europe. It is supposed to be declared 
that these relations will be broadened, deepened, and 
strengthened. As a sign of the final overcoming of former 
confrontation, joint maneuvers of NATO and former Warsaw Pact 
states are to be held as early as this year. They are supposed 
to be a preparatory step before peace missions. 
  The project defines "Partnership for Peace" as a 
transitional 
form that would link the Central and East European states to 
NATO and that would not threaten Russian reforms. Thanks to 
broad military cooperation, these relations are to be raised 
from the level of dialogue to the level of political and 
military partnership. NATO will want to adjust the Central and 
East European armies to the standard of the alliance through 
practical cooperation and officers' training. Thus, an important 
condition would be met before integration with NATO at a later 
date. 
  The first step is supposed to be joint maneuvers. Moreover, 
Central and East European states will be allowed to send liaison 
officers to NATO Headquarters. 
  In the general document, which should be signed by NATO and 
its partners soon, East European states are supposed to commit 
themselves to respecting the following rules: non-secrecy in 
national defense and budget planning; democratic control over 
the Armed Forces; allowing the United Nations and CSCE to employ 
their military units in peace missions; developing military 
cooperation to plan and carry out these missions, as well as 
transforming the Armed Forces so that they will be able to act 
jointly with NATO forces at the operational level. NATO is 
supposed to supply these states with the necessary technical 
information. Soon both parties are to select units that will 
cooperate closely with each other. 
  The final document will also include a detailed list of the 
measures that are necessary to harmonize activities, including 
the standardization of arms and equipment, as well as necessary 
for logistics, strategy, and the martial doctrine. 
  The only thing that was not made clear before the summit is 
the matter of financing the future cooperation. The mere 
establishment of additional offices and work posts will cost at 
least several million ECU. 
  Aside from that, the NATO summit is to decide whether 
quick-reaction multinational forces should be established for 
possible use in peace missions. They would be able to include 
military units of states that are not NATO members and of states 
that are not part of the military structures of the alliance, 
that is to say, France and Spain. 
  "Combined Joint Task Forces" [CJTF] [preceding four words in 
English, translated into Polish as] ("Combined Forces") -- 
consisting of all kinds of weapons, may be employed in all 
crises not envisioned in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. It 
is expected that CJTF will also consist of units of neutral 
states as well as from Central and East European states. If 
these forces were established, in crises NATO would not have to 
act as a whole; it would place only some of its military 
installations at the disposal of the Europeans. 
<H5>  [Box, p 23] </H5>
  In their reports from Central Europe, world news agencies 
draw attention to the fact that President Lech Walesa threatened 
to reject the concept of "Partnership for Peace," if NATO does 
not state unequivocally at the summit in Brussels that the 
"Partnership for Peace" program is the road leading to Poland's 
full membership in NATO. 
  Agencies report that Lech Walesa is said to have stated that 
unless the NATO summit produces a decision on opening this 
organization to states such as ours, he will not go to Prague on 
12 January to take part in the meeting between U.S. President 
Bill Clinton and Visegrad Group leaders. The President's Press 
Office did not confirm this information on Sunday when asked by 
RZECZPOSPOLITA. The decision whether Lech Walesa will go to 
Prague is supposed to be reached on Monday, after the session of 
the government and the president. In his interview with French 
television on Sunday, Walesa maintained his criticism of the 
"Partnership," calling this proposal "blackmail." 
  Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak said that the 
initiative of the U.S. President is "unclear," known only by its 
name. His talks with representatives of the U.S. Administration 
did not result in any declarations that the "Partnership for 
Peace" program will lead to membership in NATO.

<F P=106> [Interview with Polish President Lech Walesa by </F>
correspondent Grzegorz Miecugow; place and date not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] According to President Lech Walesa, if 
the political situation in Central and Eastern Europe becomes 
more complicated, our joining NATO may happen sooner. Tomorrow, 
[12 January] President Walesa is going to Prague, where he will 
take part in the Visegrad group summit. 
  [Miecugow] Tomorrow you will meet President Clinton. What do 
you want to tell the president? 
  [Walesa] Of course, what I have already said but in a 
different way. [Before], I spoke to the nation but not in a 
diplomatic language. I was counting on social pressure. One 
talks slightly differently to diplomats, but we talk about the 
same things. That is, in my opinion, I think that the leap 
should have been greater, that one should have moved further. I 
think that this has been a mistake. However, as I have said, 
one can reach the same aim at a different pace. 
  Nevertheless, these talks will be difficult because I expect 
that this concept [Partnership for Peace], which in a way has 
been imposed on us, will be defended. 
  [Miecugow] Do you still believe that Poland is one of the 
Central European states first in line to join NATO? 
  [Walesa] As a practitioner, I think that these priorities 
are 
relative. If the situation becomes difficult and dangerous, 
Poland will certainly be the first. If the situation is 
different, if great compromises happen, if there is some sort of 
pulling out [jakies takie wydzieranie], the others and the more 
minor will have a greater chance to be withdrawn, or 
incorporated [in NATO]. This is a game involving interests and 
how large the country is. Poland, however, is a medium size 
country. Other countries, and especially Russia, focus 
particular attention on us.

  [Text] President Lech Walesa received Sejm Speaker Jozef 
Oleksy in the Belweder this evening. Pointing out that in 
several hours' time he will meet U.S. President Bill Clinton in 
Prague, with whom he will discuss, among other things, the 
results of the NATO Brussels summit, the president said: We 
should have one position on this issue -- where Poland is and 
where it is going. 
  After the meeting, which lasted almost an hour, Speaker 
Oleksy told journalists that the Partnership for Peace 
initiative is not regarded by him or the president as 
sufficient, although it is a step in the right direction, and a 
step which makes it possible for Poland to continue to aspire to 
NATO membership. The speaker said that he will discuss the 
decisions taken by the Brussels summit with German politicians 
during his visit to the Federal Republic as early as Wednesday.

  [Text] Warsaw, 10 Jan--An insufficient step in the right 
direction. This is how Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski 
summed up the discussion on Partnership for Peace at Monday's 
government meeting, which preceded the Prague summit of the 
Visegrad Group. 
  Olechowski said that the Council of Ministers "welcomed the 
Partnership for Peace as an interesting initiative that goes in 
the right direction" and authorized the prime minister to 
support this program. 
  The government assessed the decisions that are expected from 
the Brussels NATO summit (reassurance concerning the U.S. 
presence in Europe, the opening of NATO to new members in an 
evolutionary process, Partnership for Peace, and a definition of 
new relations between NATO and the Western European Union) as 
favorable from the point of view of Poland's interests, but it 
has reservations because they are not specific enough. 
  President Lech Walesa, who took part in the meeting, left 
the 
Office of the Council of Ministers without making any comment to 
the press.

  [Excerpts] Warsaw, 10 Jan -- An insufficient step in the 
right direction -- this is how, according to Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Andrzej Olechowski, the government assessed on Monday 
[10 January] the U.S. proposal on Partnership for Peace. 
[passage omitted] 
  President Lech Walesa, who took part in the government 
meeting, left the Office of the Council of Ministers without 
making any comment to the press. Olechowski said that the 
president will take part in the Prague summit. According to the 
foreign minister, the president -- like the government -- 
considers the Partnership for Peace proposal as insufficient, 
which does not mean that he is against it. "If when jumping 
across a hole in the ice your jump proves too short you have 
every chance of falling in," Olechowski quoted Walesa as saying. 
  One of the Polish reservations about Partnership for Peace 
concerns the lack of a time-frame for granting NATO membership. 
"We perceive it as a process lasting several years," Olechowski 
said. He recalled that even a few months ago there was no 
mention of NATO opening up to new members and added that at 
present the "partnership" makes our future participation in the 
structures of the treaty plausible. In his opinion the 
postponement in time of Poland's membership will not bring about 
immediate negative effects because currently there is no 
military threat. Olechowski said that he does not regard our 
present position concerning NATO as a waiting-room situation but 
rather as "being engaged to a girl who only yesterday said that 
she was going to get married but did not say to whom." He 
expressed the hope that Poland will be in the first group of 
countries which NATO will incorporate in the future. 
  According to Olechowski, as far as democratic standards and 
the development of the military sector are concerned, Poland is 
no more lagging behind than was Greece when that country joined 
the treaty. He said that issues related to the funding 
necessary to implement the "partnership" program were also 
discussed at the meeting. He emphasized that the pace of 
bringing Poland closer to NATO will depend on our financial 
contribution. 
  Asked whether he envisages a meeting with Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, if his visit to Poland takes place, Olechowski 
said that his diary is full. "If I were to meet every member of 
parliament, I would not be able to do my job," he said, adding 
that Zhirinovskiy may enter Poland, but if he breaches our 
interests, he will be taken back to the border with an 
administrative visa

<F P=106> [Interview with Jerzy Milewski, chief of National Security </F>
Bureau and deputy defense minister, by Andrzej Woyciechowski at 
the Radio Zet studio in Warsaw on the "Guest of Radio Zet" 
program -- live] 
  [Text] [Woyciechowski] How should we, Poles, feel after 
yesterday's NATO summit? 
  [Milewski] We should feel that our duty is well performed 
because the recent political campaign headed by Foreign Minister 
Olechowski and Lech Walesa made the American-devised 
"Partnership for Peace" proposal, approved by the summit, more 
far-reaching than was expected several months ago. 
  [Woyciechowski] In other words, we have won at least 
something. Does this not mean that the previous governments 
could do more than they actually did? 
  [Milewski] No, they couldn't do anything more. Now we can 
see what caused our major problems and where the main resistance 
was. The 16 states that make up the bloc should be convinced 
that the expansion will be beneficial for them in the first 
place, and not just for somebody in Central Europe. In addition 
to government leaders, this also applies to governments, 
legislatures, and societies of those countries. 
  [Woyciechowski] So where was the highest resistance? 
  [Milewski] I think all 16 members lacked a full 
understanding 
as to why NATO should be expanded at all. However, the main 
opposition was mounted by the southern countries because they 
receive NATO aid in the form of weapons. They know that with 
new members entering the bloc, the assistance provided to them 
will be substantially slashed. Another source of resistance 
came from political circles in the United States that have 
basically Russia in the focus of their attention and are 
preoccupied with a dialog with Moscow politicians. The most 
understanding was exhibited by our neighbors -- Germany, 
Denmark, and Norway. 
  [Woyciechowski] What you are saying about the southern 
states 
receiving substantial assistance is very interesting. You 
probably have in mind Spain, Portugal, and Greece. 
  [Milewski] Yes. On the other hand, Turkey, which is located 
in the eastern direction, absolutely supports us. Obviously, 
with Russia within a stone's throw, it knows very well what it 
means to be on the edge. 
  [Woyciechowski] As a matter of fact, we don't know what this 
"Partnership for Peace" is all about. Could you tell us exactly 
what it means? 
  [Milewski] The "Partnership for Peace" is a program intended 
to make possible cooperation and rapprochement of the North 
Atlantic Cooperation Council members with NATO countries in 
military, political, and other spheres, such as environmental 
protection and economic matters. 
  [Woyciechowski] If I understand correctly, the Partnership 
is 
a very broad formula that will be implemented only after 
subsequent conclusions of bilateral agreements on military and 
political cooperation. Is that correct? 
  [Milewski] To the best of our knowledge... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And we don't know all the 
details yet, right? 
  [Milewski] Yes... 
  [Woyciechowski] When will we know all the details? 
  [Milewski] Probably tomorrow. 
  [Woyciechowski] In Prague. 
  [Milewski] Yes, in Prague or in Warsaw when we know the full 
contents of the document approved by the NATO summit yesterday. 
This is a complex program providing for many types of 
cooperation among countries seeking integration with NATO. And 
the scope of this cooperation is to be determined by the target 
countries and not by the plan's authors. It's a strange 
proposal, but this is what it looks like. 
  [Woyciechowski] Does this mean that those bilateral 
agreements on military and political cooperation will be 
different depending on which country signs them? 
  [Milewski] The framework cooperation agreement should be the 
same. Western leaders declare that there will be no 
differentiation among post-communist countries, including 
Russia, and neutral states -- Austria, Finland, and Sweden. On 
the other hand, specific implementation of those agreements may 
be different for each state. Some of them, for example, might 
choose between looser or closer military cooperation with NATO 
countries. 
  [Woyciechowski] What kind of cooperation will Poland 
propose? 
  [Milewski] I believe we would opt for the broadest possible 
cooperation as long as our budget will sustain it. 
  [Woyciechowski] One of the Partnership's provisions speaks 
about cooperation in drafting the defense budget. How will NATO 
cooperate with Poland whose military spendings account for 2.1 
percent of the budget? Is it possible at all? 
  [Milewski] That provision is about technical assistance in 
crafting the budget in order to meet Western standards with 
regard to the so-called budget transparence. The budget 
transparence is regarded throughout the world as proof of the 
openness of the country it belongs to. This makes it impossible 
for a country to conceal preparations for a possible attack 
against its neighbors. This provision is not about financial 
assistance that NATO could offer us. We count more on 
technological openness and access to modern armaments available 
in the West. We also anticipate closer contacts among our 
servicemen starting from highest staff officers and finishing 
with rank and file soldiers. 
  [Woyciechowski] In other words, joint military exercises? 
  [Milewski] Both theoretical military exercises involving 
only 
maps and the teamwork of our detachments in the field. 
  [Woyciechowski] If everything goes well and Poland signs a 
military cooperation agreement, when do you think the first 
U.S.-Polish exercise could take place? 
  [Milewski] General Shalikashvili said that it may -- and it 
should -- happen already in 1994. Should these exercise take 
place on our territory and the Western troops cover the costs of 
their arrival and stationing here, the scope of our teamwork 
could be even broader. We can't move our troops there solely 
because of financial problems, which may become a major setback 
in developing such cooperation. 
  [Woyciechowski] When do you think Poland can become a full 
NATO member? In 2000, 2010..? When will we eventually get what 
we want? 
  [Milewski] I would not like to tell fortunes here. However, 
there are two things that I can tell you. First, the Polish 
strategic plan is to achieve NATO membership in the 1990's. 
Given the present situation in those countries, the waiting 
time could be from two to four years. Two years because that is 
the time left until the next summit of the bloc. Assuming that 
NATO countries accept our membership, the process of formal 
admission and approval by their governments and parliaments 
might take quite a long time yet. 
  [Woyciechowski] You, however, seem to be optimistic about 
the 
NATO issue? 
  [Milewski] Well, as far back as two years ago, it didn't 
seem 
the right thing to even mention our intention of joining the 
bloc as the West perceived the idea as being provocative toward 
Russia. The West has always been very anxious not to anger 
Russia. Since we are neighbors, we don't want to provoke 
Russia, either. We seek to establish good-neighborly relations 
with that country. On the other hand, we are absolutely 
convinced that Russia should not be provoked by saber-rattling 
and weakness as well. And leaving Poland and other Central and 
East European countries in the gray zone means exactly what we 
call provoking Russia with our weakness and exposing us as a 
potential target for Russia's expansionist policies, still 
popular among many Russian politicians. 
  [Woyciechowski] Is it essential to Polish interests that 
there still be some Russian troops on the territory of the 
former German Democratic Republic? Does this fact have any 
significance for us? 
  [Milewski] Russian troops in Germany as well as those 
heavily concentrated in the Kaliningrad zone are of great 
significance to us; we would like these troops to be 
deconcentrated. However, the most important thing for us is the 
policy pursued by Moscow, because we do not think that there is 
a threat of putting these units into action by their local 
commanders without authorization. The disintegration of Russian 
state structures has not reached that stage when such events may 
be expected. 
  [Woyciechowski] There are different rumors about the Russian 
concentration in Kaliningrad... What are those troops doing 
there? 
  [Milewski] For the time being, those troops are just 
stationing there since their withdrawal from Germany and Poland. 
We can only approve the fact that these troops are withdrawn 
and deployed on Russian territory. However, in the long run, we 
think it is absolutely improper and unnecessary for Russia to 
maintain such a big concentration of its military force... 
  [Woyciechowski] How heavy is this concentration? 
  [Milewski] Well, comparable to the military force of entire 
Poland. The Russian Navy concentrated in the port of Baltiysk 
near Kaliningrad is larger than the entire Polish Navy. The air 
forces are comparable, too. As for the ground forces, I guess 
they are smaller... 
  [Woyciechowski] ... on this small scrap of land? 
  [Milewski] Yes, on this small scrap. It is, perhaps, the 
strongest fortress in the world, not only in Europe. 
  [Woyciechowski] Is the Polish Defense Ministry preparing new 
offices for new coalition deputy ministers? 
  [Milewski] I do not know anything about it. I have not seen 
any special groups of painters busy at the ministry. The 
concept approved by President Walesa and Prime Minister Pawlak 
some time ago called for reducing the hired civilian personnel 
of the Defense Ministry. It also provided for the reduction of 
three deputy minister offices to two. 
  [Woyciechowski] Thus, there are two deputy ministers by now? 
  [Milewski] This is correct. 
  [Woyciechowski] Is there any need for more? Do you feel 
overworked? 
  [Milewski] In my opinion, we do not need more. Those 
changes in the organizational structure, which we hope to 
implement soon, can be controlled by two deputy ministers alone. 
It will do, especially now that the General Staff has its own 
head in the position of a deputy minister or even higher. De 
facto, the minister of national defense has three close aides, 
two of whom are civilians.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bronislaw Geremek, parliamentary caucus </F>
leader of the Democratic Union, by Andrzej Woyciechowski at the 
Radio Zet studio in Warsaw on the "Guest of Radio Zet" program 
-- live] 
  [Text] [Woyciechowski] Radio Zet's guest today is 
Professor Bronislaw Geremek, a leader of the Democratic Union 
[UD]. Good morning to you. 
  [Geremek] Good morning. 
  [Woyciechowski] Why does NATO not want us? 
  [Geremek] First of all, we would have to ask why we want to 
be in NATO. 
  [Woyciechowski] So why do we want to be in NATO? 
  [Geremek] I think the answer is not very obvious at all. In 
essence, NATO is currently experiencing a crisis -- it is a 
creature of the Cold War and it was supposed to be a 
countermeasure against the Soviet Union's imperialism, it was 
supposed to be Europe's and the West's defense. Now the Soviet 
Union is no longer here and the Cold War is over, and what will 
happen to NATO now? Well, it is simply the only European 
security organization which functions in practice and which has 
means at its disposal which enable it to respond to any kind of 
danger in Europe. I think NATO is currently going through a 
transformation. NATO must stop being a defensive, 
military-political organization and it must become an 
organization serving European stability; it is not yet ready to 
perform that role. After all, NATO is not prepared to try to 
overcome ethnic and border conflicts which are everyday 
occurrences in Europe currently. So it follows that NATO will 
transform itself. Poland needs to join a security organization 
so as to have a feeling of peace, and not because there should 
be a vacuum or because we should be orphans of the Warsaw Pact. 
I think Polish society has had historical experiences and 
historical perspective, and it remembers how alone Poland used 
to be. But society also has a feeling of a lack of social and 
economic security, at least in this one area -- in the area of 
politics, society would like to have a feeling of peace and some 
minimum guarantees. That is precisely what NATO membership 
would mean to Poland. 
  [Woyciechowski] Was NATO not established to send their 
troops, tanks and aircraft in case -- knock on wood that it 
never happens -- somebody attacks Poland? Is that not what NATO 
is for? 
  [Geremek] There are two articles in the treaty -- I mean the 
Washington Treaty which established NATO -- there is Article 5 
which is the one we are after. It provides that in the advent 
one of the member states is attacked, all the other members make 
a decision -- rather automatically -- to defend the member which 
was attacked. There is also Article 4 which speaks about the 
NATO Council holding a meeting in specific cases to decide 
whether or not to intervene for the defense of a country which 
does not necessarily have to be a member. 
  [Woyciechowski] So NATO can intervene in such cases, but it 
does not have to? 
  [Geremek] Exactly. It has to under Article 5 though. 
  [Woyciechowski] But it can intervene also in cases of 
nonmembers being attacked? 
  [Geremek] Yes. The whole argument now is indeed about 
Article 5, since such a provision gives the citizens of a 
country a sense of security and at the same time it is a 
deterrent factor. But if one considers what the current 
political situation is about, I think the issue of our 
membership in NATO -- I am expressing my personal view here, but 
in my opinion I have reasons to think that -- is not so 
dramatically important at all. That is because it is 
inconceivable to imagine Poland being attacked by a country.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And what about Yugoslavia? 
Could Croats or Bosnians have pictured somebody attacking them? 
  [Geremek, hesitating] I think what you are saying represents 
the type of thinking used by Americans, but it is false. Poland 
is in the center of Europe and Europe's fate is inextricably 
linked with Poland's fate. If an aggression occurred against 
Poland -- who could make such an aggression? Let us say it is 
one of the neighbors.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Such an aggression would come 
either from the left or the right. 
  [Geremek] Historically speaking, they used to come from 
the left or the right -- that is the way it happened to us 
throughout history. So in case an aggression like this occurs, 
all of Europe would immediately be involved. The French did not 
want to die for Gdansk in 1939 and then they died for their own 
cities -- they lost the war. The necessary political 
imagination, so to speak, should make us realize that Poland is 
not in the Balkans and that one cannot make Poland marginal. 
There cannot be a situation where if there is a conflict 
occurring right here in Europe's center, NATO would regard it as 
a marginal conflict because NATO's border is on the Oder and 
Neisse rivers. That would be impossible. Moreover, if one were 
to assume that there could be politicians who would think that, 
then they would be acting to their own detriment. And it is not 
just a theoretical supposition that such politicians could exist 
-- they do in fact exist. I have read an interview with a 
politician from the Western European Union who replied to 
precisely this kind of question by saying: Well, we will not 
intervene, but there is no such danger to begin with. Now.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] In a word, to recap all this 
-- in your view, NATO's fear of accepting Poland, the Czech 
Republic, and Hungary is more linked to the destabilization in 
the Balkans, to those little, local wars, and to the fact that 
looking from Washington, one confuses Poland with Yugoslavia -- 
and it is less linked to Poland's internal situation and also to 
the Zhirinovskiy factor? 
  [Geremek] The first part is precisely that -- namely that 
one looks through the perspective of a completely separate 
conflict and thinks that one can make the issue marginal. A 
second part that you mentioned is the issue of the priority 
occupied by Russian issues. The West has very often in the past 
been bewitched by Russia and it gave Russia absolute priority. 
By the way, it is my view that we, Poles, should keep in mind 
that Russia continues to be a huge country and a superpower. It 
is afflicted with a disease but the disease is only temporary. 
But the thing is that American politics are now being guided by 
people who observe the Russian situation, and for whom the most 
important thing is to have some kind of agreement with the 
disordered East Europe. I think that even being familiar with 
the political geography of this part of Europe requires a 
certain effort, and it is a very easy thing to say to oneself: 
Here is a partner and now the thing is that the partner should 
-- as the Clinton administration has the habit of saying now -- 
be a partner in cooperation. I would say in that regard we can 
find traces of an old slogan which said that there must be 
order, and that the world will be peaceful if there is order in 
Warsaw. Well, that type of thinking is false and one will have 
to pay a price for that in the future precisely because Russia's 
main problem right now is the emergence of Zhirinovskiy. It is 
not a personnel problem or one associated with the person, but 
the problem is that imperial policy in which there are 
territorial claims and a desire to destabilize Europe and the 
world -- the problem is that this kind of policy gained the 
support of one quarter of this huge country's electorate. 
  [Woyciechowski] Who is Zhirinovskiy? How should he be 
described? Is he a fascist? Is it fascism or is it something 
else? 
  [Geremek] It is dangerous. It is a danger and really -- the 
plague, cholera, or typhoid fever seem minor by comparison, 
since it is a deadly [word indistinct]. 
  [Woyciechowski] And how did it come about in Russia? How 
does someone like Zhirinovskiy emerge there? 
  [Geremek] I think that one should consider two phenomena 
here: The first one is that transformations and leaving 
communism behind are painful processes -- and we know something 
about that, too -- so there is impatience in society, 
frustration, and unhappiness with the reforms. There is also 
another factor -- that is something which concerns the Russians' 
national pride. Russian dignity has been trampled on during 
these years, and that happened not only because their leaders 
banged their shoes against the seats at the United Nations -- 
Russians were ashamed of that. But what is worse is that all of 
a sudden Russia has no influence over anything, it is regarded 
as an object with which anybody is free to play. The world's 
fate is not dependent on Russia even by a bit, but there is 
still an army there, there is a political class, and there is 
also a kind of popular feeling: We used to be a great country, 
and now what? Now, Zhirinovskiy was capable of telling 
everybody what they wanted to hear: He told laborers that they 
will earn more and that the workplaces will not be closed, he 
told peasants that some way or another will be found -- either 
food production will be subsidized, or assistance will be given, 
if not to kolkhozs, then to private farms, and that his men know 
how to handle all this. And he told all Russians, including the 
military, KGB members, and everybody else, that Russia must be 
great, that it has a right to greatness, that it can have an 
imperial policy since it is in fact an empire and has such 
traditions dating back to before Stalin and the communist 
revolution. Now, he had the ability to use these sentiments for 
his own goals. One can say, if that is the case, to understand 
that the phenomenon means to immediately diminish its 
significance, as it were. I am very strongly opposed to many 
observers of the Russian scene -- including some of my friends 
-- who in my view tend to minimize the problem of Zhirinovskiy 
and they are very unwise in doing that. It is the problem of 
the future of democracy in Russia. If Russia is supposed to be 
a partner -- which it can be -- in world politics and as a 
democratic country, and one whose economy is improving -- the 
phenomenon of Zhirinovskiy has a fundamental significance for 
both these issues. 
  [Woyciechowski] What is the difference between 
Zhirinovskiy and [Party X leader and former presidential 
candidate Stanyslaw] Tyminski? Why is the first one dangerous 
but the other one not? 
  [Geremek] Zhirinovskiy scored a success whereas Mr. Tyminski 
did not. I think an important difference is that Zhirinovskiy 
has within his clientele not only the capital of social 
frustrations but also huge structures. There is the problem of 
the Army. Others say there is also the problem of the KGB. But 
even if you consider the problem of the Army alone -- I think it 
has between 2 and 2.5 million people, or more than that, in 
recent years all of a sudden it became a political factor and 
the Army is full of bitterness: A soldier who is told to storm 
the parliament building -- no matter what cause he is supposed 
to be advancing -- still has a lot of unanswered questions and 
besides, the soldier is being involved in politics. Well, now a 
type of politician has emerged whom soldiers and generals can 
trust, and they invest some of their hopes in him, so to speak, 
in the sense of saying to themselves that it is worthwhile to 
serve the country, make some changes and.... [pauses] 
Zhirinovskiy can say -- and the demographics of his electorate 
is proof of that -- that he gained the support of the Army. 
That is extremely important and that is the reason -- among 
others -- for which we cannot diminish Zhirinovskiy and his 
measures. 
  [Woyciechowski] Let us go back for a moment to the beginning 
of our conversation and the issue of NATO. Now, several minutes 
into the conversation, I will try to recap what I understood you 
to say: Joining NATO is not the most important thing for Poland 
since NATO is no longer what it used to be. It is NATO that 
must change, and then the time will come to deliberate what 
position Poland should take in this new European security 
system. Did I understand you correctly? 
  [Geremek] Well, I have been trying to go against the 
wind.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] In a word, is it very 
important or not very important, I mean this [words indistinct]. 
Is it really the most important thing? 
  [Geremek] It is really important but not the most important 
thing. I am going against the wind of the situation which was 
recently created among the public. I think it is a shame that 
it happened that the issue of joining NATO was used in political 
campaigns -- it should not have been. It is a classic issue 
which diplomacy should have prepared and, once the possibility 
of joining NATO came up, then it could have become political 
fact. There are no possibilities right now of immediately 
joining NATO. If we were to join NATO right now, the state 
budget would not be able to carry the burden which modernizing 
the Army requires, as well as adaptation to NATO's standards. 
But there is a dangerous thing -- and I openly admit that it 
bothers me not only as a politician but also as a citizen -- 
that there could occur a refusal on NATO's part to allow Poland, 
the Czech or Slovak Republics, or Hungary to become NATO members. 
  [Woyciechowski] That simply affirms the fact that the iron 
curtain -- even though in a symbolic way it no longer exists -- 
remains at the Oder and Neisse, whereas we would like it to 
stand at least at the Bug river. 
  [Geremek] I do not even think that there is a postulate made 
on our part to move the iron curtain to the Bug river. What we 
want is for the curtain to disappear altogether. Right now.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But in actual terms, the 
border is really Europe's border? 
  [Geremek] Yes, but it should be an open border. I think -- 
and I often stress this and I have been saying this for a long 
time -- that it is very important that Russians have a feeling 
of being free of any iron curtain which somebody could be 
erecting so as to separate them. Why is that? Even if one 
takes a skeptical view on chances in the face of Russian 
democracy, it is still important that the chances not disappear. 
Now, such a chance exists only when the West is open. The 
division in 19th century Russia between Slavophils and 
Zapadnikis [not further specified] existed because there was a 
chance. If we were now to close the door on Russia's chances of 
joining Europe and the West, we would weaken Russian democracy 
through that. That is why I think there is no closed border, so 
to speak. But there is a problem if NATO refuses to allow 
Poland and other countries which are our neighbors -- the 
question arises: For what reason? NATO countries are 
democratic countries and so is Poland, no matter how the 
political configuration may change. Should these countries be 
based on market economy? Poland has built a market economy, and 
Poland wants to be part of the peace process and of European 
stabilization. Why [words indistinct]...? 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But I am sure you have asked 
that question of Western politicians. How do they respond? 
  [Geremek] They do not respond at all because they have a 
reasoning hidden here which we must not approve of and to which 
they have no right, namely: Here is the big country of Russia 
which should not be subjected to frustrations, and it is 
important that its right to a sphere of influence, so to speak, 
be recognized, and.... 
  Is that kind of statement inelegant in politics? Should 
one avoid such statements in politics? Is it unacceptable? 
  [Geremek, laughing] Elegance I think is not very important 
in politics, but history is. When statements like this appeared 
in the past, Poland was losing its independence. And in the 
memory of.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And not just in 1939? 
  [Geremek] Correct. That is precisely our national history. 
When we are told that two big countries will provide guarantees 
to us so we should not be concerned, our answer to that is: We 
have already seen that, and then there were the partitions of 
Poland. See, so national memory is an element of shaping 
politics. That is precisely why I think one should regard it 
[the Zhirinovskiy issue] as a serious and important issue. I 
think it is a very good thing that all of a sudden issues of 
foreign policy have become the focus of attention of the people 
-- that is an achievement. 
  [Woyciechowski] For the first time in the last four years, 
most of the talk is not just about money or unemployment but 
also about foreign policy. 
  [Geremek] Yes, this is the first time. And that is a very 
important thing since there is a need for this kind of 
sensitivity to the country's defense system, the country's 
future, and to protecting Poland's sovereignty. 
  [Woyciechowski] But let us talk now for a while -- to end 
this conversation -- about money and the budget. Will UD vote 
in favor of the budget? I mean once the budget returns. 
  [Geremek] I will answer diplomatically since we are leaving 
diplomatic issues now: We will see what the second version of 
the budget will be like [words indistinct].... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But do you hope the budget 
will be altered in the Sejm commissions? 
  [Geremek] I am somewhat afraid it will be -- I think it will 
deteriorate. Budgets are instruments of conducting policy and 
we do not approve of the policy [by Pawlak's cabinet]. Voting 
is always about showing some trust. How can we trust a team 
which first of all did not keep commitments it made to its own 
voters? They promised everything to everybody. 
  [Woyciechowski] [Words indistinct] promised and you did not 
believe. 
  [Geremek] Yes, but now they are coming to me and it is I who 
is supposed to show trust. They disappointed the voters so they 
are bound to disappoint me as well. That is the first issue. 
Another one is that the budget demonstrates enormous 
centralization trends which are dangerous because one can say 
that after the forty-something years there is a natural, 
internal pressure, so to speak, within the entire functioning of 
the state apparatus, I mean a pressure in the direction of 
centralized distribution of money. And money is power. Unless 
you counteract that trend with a wise and tough policy, the 
trend will prevail. There is no such wise and tough 
decentralization policy -- on the contrary, there is a spirit of 
taking power, and I mean taking power by officials in Warsaw. 
It is from Warsaw that voivodes [local government officials] 
are appointed -- what the coalition wants to achieve is for 
Warsaw officials to have the money and then to give it to the 
appropriate people so they can be in power. Well, we cannot 
accept such a concept. 
  [Woyciechowski] Whose concept is it -- [Prime Minister] 
Pawlak's or [Democratic Left Alliance leader] Kwasniewski's? 
Which one of them acts like that? 
  [Geremek] Well, if you allow me to, I would like to.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You would like to avoid 
answering that? 
  [Geremek] No, I have a grievance against journalists that 
this is the way they approach issues like this. What I mean is 
that it is not a question of whether Pawlak is nicer than 
Kwasniewski or vice versa, but what kind of policy each of them 
conducts. It is precisely Chairman Kwasniewski -- to my 
surprise, I was stunned -- who said [words indistinct]: Replace 
voivodes, take power into your hands, we have to show we are in 
power in all the areas where we won. Well, that is a philosophy 
of power which is explained first and then implemented. On the 
issue of the budget, its composition and its implementation also 
-- there are no differences. So the first issue is where Pawlak 
and Kwasniewski act together and in the same manner, and 
secondly there is the issue of possible differences -- so far 
these differences are of minor importance. 
  [Woyciechowski] Thank you very much for the conversation. 
Radio Zet's guest today has been Professor Bronislaw Geremek. 
Thank you very much. 
  [Geremek] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Article by Dawid Warszawski: "Winners of the Consolation </F>
Prize"] 
  [Text] NATO membership has become a key issue for us. But 
we know that not only do we have no prospect of joining NATO 
either today or in the foreseeable future, we have no reason to 
expect anyone to ever tell us when we can join NATO and under 
what terms. The decision due to be made at the NATO summit will 
be a disaster for Polish diplomacy. Could it have been avoided? 
  In a certain sense, no. Once Poland had formally announced 
its desire to join NATO, and especially once Russia had 
expressed its objection to this, it has not been possible to 
back down. The postcommunist coalition government could 
certainly not have withdraw Poland's bid to join, for the 
significance of such a volte-face would have been obvious. But 
should Poland have made such an effort to join? 
<H5>  What We Wanted </H5>
  For Poland, NATO membership would have been a triple 
success. 
Symbolically, it would have satisfied our pro-Western ambitions 
and permitted an exceptionally favorable integration with the 
most important political and military structure of the West. 
  But most of all, it would have guaranteed us a degree of 
security that our country has never known. Our NATO bid was 
brought on by fears of a possible repetition of our recent 
negative past, and no one can say that these fears are not 
justified. It is enough to consider the danger of reemerging 
Russian expansionism. The conclusion was automatic -- Poland 
simply had to apply for NATO membership. 
<H5>  Why Did They Not Want Us? </H5>
  But it is Poland's thirst for security guarantees that made 
NATO reject our bid. Considering a possible expansion of NATO, 
its members asked themselves whether accepting Poland or any 
other former eastern bloc country to their ranks would increase 
their security. 
  The answer had to be no, on account of the genuine threat to 
Poland from Russia. Out of all the countries of Central Europe, 
only the Czechs were graded for membership differently, which 
would explain their ostentatious departure from Visegrad 
solidarity. In the event of a Russian attack on Poland, NATO 
would have to help Poland as a member country, otherwise the 
principle of collective security would cease to exist, and hence 
NATO itself would become defunct. Why should NATO risk 
accepting us? 
<H5>  Fear of Russia and Russia's Fears </H5>
  Poland's response to this question is obvious. If Poland 
remains outside NATO, Russian extremists might be tempted to 
attack it, and it would certainly encourage instability in a 
strategically key part of Europe. NATO agrees with this view, 
but insists that such an eventuality is less of a risk than the 
issue of security guarantees to Poland. The British guarantees 
made to Poland in 1939 are quickly brought to mind in this 
regard. Western historians have denounced these guarantees as 
particularly irresponsible. 
  What is more, NATO views the Russian opposition to its 
expansion not as an impermissible case of Russian interference, 
which is what Warsaw thinks, but as as a justifiable expression 
of Russia's concern for its own security. Let is leave aside 
the problem of whether or not Poland's NATO entry would 
strengthen [Russian Liberal Democratic Party leader] 
Zhirinovskiy's position (as Strobe Talbott, the new pro-Russian 
U.S. secretary of state, claims it would), or whether, on the 
contrary, it would force the Russian extremists to think again 
(as our Foreign Ministry rather naively believes). 
  The point is that Russia is and will remain for a long time 
NATO's only potential adversary in Europe, and it cannot fail to 
react in a hostile manner to the prospect of moving the line of 
potential confrontation several hundred kilometers closer to its 
border. This strategic consideration is important. Because of 
it, Germany was the only NATO country to support our application 
to join, for in the event of our joining NATO, the line of 
confrontation would no longer correspond to the eastern German 
border. 
  NATO has no reason to antagonize Russia, especially at a 
time 
of imperial fever. But even a democratic Russia would have to 
oppose our membership of NATO. At the thought of an eastward 
shift of the NATO border, any Moscow government would react just 
like President Reagan reacted in the 1980's to the threat of an 
expansion of communism in Central America. NATO is prone to 
accept the Russian point of view. 
<H5>  Vain Hopes </H5>
  So it is hard to understand why so much hope was attached in 
Warsaw to just one statement from President Yeltsin, whereby 
Russia had no objection to our efforts to join NATO. After all, 
it was clear that whatever Yeltsin might say, Russia's 
geopolitical interests would not change. 
  Poland's NATO membership would bring it a host of troubles 
but no tangible advantages. Why did we expect NATO to accept 
us? It was a mistake to make a formal application to join, 
especially when this application was justified by a threat to 
Poland -- in other words, a threat to NATO. The fact that 
others made this mistake at the same time as us makes no 
difference. It is Poland, not, for instance Hungary, that is 
the basic object of the Central European contest of strength. 
Those who think they might move the West by referring to noble 
principles and past services rendered should talk to the 
president of Bosnia. 
<H5>  Stakes Too High? </H5>
  It is not out of the question that if we had not applied for 
full membership, we might have been able to negotiate quite a 
good unilateral deal that might not have contained any security 
guarantees, but it might have permitted political integration. 
In the meantime, the "Partnership for Peace" proposal is all 
that we are being invited to. 
  NATO is addressing these mainly rhetorical proposals of 
cooperation to all the countries of the former Soviet bloc, 
suggesting to them that NATO might eventually turn into 
something more concrete. As far as the "partnership" proposal 
is concerned, it means that NATO will care for the security of 
independent Poland as much as it will care for the independence 
of Kyrgyzstan. If I were from Kyrgyzstan, I might be pleased to 
hear it. 
  By hastily playing for high stakes, we have risked losing. 
Henceforth, we can only expect a part of the kitty -- 
association with the Western European Union. Most probably, all 
that awaits us is the "Partnership for Peace" proposal -- in 
other words, the community of consolation prize winners.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk by </F>
Christophe Urbanowicz; place and date not given: "We Want To Get 
Out of the Gray Area of Security" 
  [Text] Poland is prepared to commit itself to a broad 
cooperative effort with the NATO member countries, including 
joint maneuvers, within the framework of the U.S. "Partnership 
for Peace" initiative, Polish Defense Minister Piotr 
Kolodziejczyk announced in an interview with LE QUOTIDIEN DE 
PARIS. He is waiting for the Atlantic Alliance to come up with 
precise membership criteria for countries like Poland instead of 
closing itself off in a "selfish and shortsighted strategy of 
every man for himself." 
  [Urbanowicz] With the U.S. "Partnership for Peace" 
initiative, is the West sending you a signal of support strong 
enough to appease your fears and reaffirm your European 
aspirations? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] "Partnership for Peace" can only meet our 
expectations if it opens up clear prospects for countries like 
Poland of belonging to the Atlantic Alliance. 
  We understand that at present it is difficult for the West 
to 
put forward a precise date for our integration into the common 
security zone. However, we expect the NATO member countries to 
come up with clear criteria in the short term for NATO 
membership. These criteria could be compliance with the 
disarmament treaty, the UN Charter, the Charter of Human Rights 
and Citizen Rights, the obligation to have civilian control over 
the army, as well as transparency in military budgets. 
  [Urbanowicz] How far is Poland prepared to go in terms of 
military cooperation with the NATO member countries as part of 
"Partnership for Peace"? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] We are prepared to commit ourselves to a 
broad range of actions, including joint maneuvers. I recognize 
that this cooperation could cause certain financial problems for 
Poland, but the 1994 budget has not yet been passed by 
Parliament, and expenditure for the "Partnership" could be 
written into it. 
  We have already established broad contacts with many 
countries in the alliance. Poland remains open to other 
initiatives in the area of European security, such as the Danish 
proposal for military cooperation between the countries along 
the Baltic Sea. 
  [Urbanowicz] How did you receive the French-German proposal 
to offer Poland the status of "associate member" in the WEU 
(Western European Union), which is the embryo of the common 
security and defense policy of the European Union? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] France is a great advocate of the WEU. It is 
obvious that the process of integrating the countries of Central 
and East Europe into the European Union must go hand in hand 
with a rapprochement with the WEU, which plays the role of 
NATO's European pillar. Because I know that the United States 
takes a dim view of this initiative, I am still a bit skeptical 
about the WEU. 
  However, the fact remains that, for Poland, the most 
important thing is to get out of the gray area of security it 
has gotten into. I therefore feel that cooperation with the WEU 
can only benefit us. 
  [Urbanowicz] How much time will it take for Poland to reach 
the level of the countries of the Atlantic Alliance? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] For the moment, the West is mostly refusing 
to give us technological cooperation. Our own industry can 
produce limited quantities of good equipment, but not all of the 
parameters of this equipment match Western standards. Without 
technological openness by the NATO countries, these standards 
could prove to be inaccessible to Poland. I hope that the 
"Partnership" will make an initial breakthrough in this area, 
which is very important to us, especially now. 
  [Urbanowicz] What does Poland fear? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] For us, the areas of destabilization lie in 
eastern and southeastern Europe. The West does not seem to 
realize this, and it is therefore abandoning us. The West thinks 
that it no longer has anything to fear because the USSR has 
disappeared and because Russia is so wrapped up in its own 
problems. As for the countries in East Europe, they will have to 
get by on their own. This selfish "every man for himself" policy 
demonstrates shortsightedness. 
  [Urbanowicz] Can the development of cooperation within the 
Visegrad Group (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, and Slovakia) 
become the key to opening the European Union's door to its 
members? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Not necessarily. It is above all a common 
platform from which the countries of Central Europe can speak 
with a single voice. The West is watching us do so with some 
caution and probably does not really think we can work 
effectively together within the four-member Visegrad Group. We 
want to prove otherwise.

<F P=106> [Untitled commentary by Adam Michnik] </F>
  [Text] It seemed as if our countries had learned from the 
bitter experience of Munich, Yalta, and the Brezhnev Doctrine, 
which permitted the making of decisions about Poland's fate 
without Poland's participation. It seemed that Visegrad would 
change all this. 
  Visegrad was also a chance for stability in the center of 
Europe. It could have become a real partner for the powerful 
countries. It enjoyed excellent reviews. 
  But it did not last long. The disintegration of 
Czechoslovakia was the first blow to Visegrad. Then 
Slovak-Hungarian conflicts broke out. And then politicians, not 
just in the Czech Republic, decided that they would reach Europe 
sooner if they went alone. 
  It looks like the greatest political chance of the Poles, 
Czechs, Slovaks, and Hungarians in the 20th century may be 
wasted.

  [Text] Warsaw, 8 Jan--In the view of the Christian-National 
Union [ZChN], the Polish-Ukrainian reconciliation that should be 
the aim of both nations must be preceded by the revelation and 
condemnation by the Ukrainian authorities of the atrocities 
perpetrated on the population of Volhynia by the Ukrainian 
Insurgent Army [UPA] [in 1943]. 
  A statement issued by the ZChN Political Committee says that 
"the restoration of the property of the Ukrainian populace that 
in significant measure supported the ethnic cleansing and that 
was nationalized during `Operation Wisla' may take place in the 
event there is a parallel restoration of the property of the 
Polish population expelled from Galicia and Volhynia during and 
after World War II." 
  The statement was issued in association with a letter from 
Ukrainian circles in Poland to the speaker of the Sejm in 
December of last year with a request for the abolition of the 
consequences of `Operation Wisla', said Marian Pilka, member of 
the ZChN Political Committee, speaking to journalists. 
  The statement also asserts that the destruction of the 
Polish 
cultural heritage and the prevention of the restoration of 
Catholic church buildings to the Roman Catholic Church on 
territory at present belonging to Ukraine is directed against 
Polish-Ukrainian reconciliation.

  [Text] Cracow, 8 January--At a rally in the Cracow Market 
Square on 8 January, members of the Polish National Party [PWN] 
and its leader Boleslaw Tejkowski burned German and Israeli 
flags to mark the 55th anniversary of the death of Roman 
Dmowski, the founder of the Polish nationalist movement. 
  As homage to Roman Dmowski, about 120 PWN supporters lit 
lamps and laid red and white carnations at the Tomb of the 
Unknown Soldier in Jan Matejko Square. Under the slogans 
"Boleslaw Tejkowski for Polish president", "Nationalists not 
fascists", "Romanians go home", and "Germans and Jews get out of 
Polish Silesia", the demonstrators marched along the streets of 
the city toward Market Square, where they burned the flags. 
  B. Tejkowski, the PWN chairman, told the rally and Cracow 
residents gathered in Market Square that Poland's attempts to 
join the European Union and President Walesa's intention to 
invite NATO armies to our garrisons constitute the greatest 
dangers for Poland at the moment. 
  The police, who did not issue an official permit to the PWN 
for the rally, did not intervene.

  [Text] Public opinion polls are geared to the coming visit 
of U.S. President Bill Clinton. Ilona Dientsbierove has more 
details. 
  [Dienstbierova] The DEMA joint-stock company has prepared a 
series of questions concerning President Clinton's visit, 
targeted at 300 respondents from all Prague districts. 
  Some 63 percent of Prague citizens are looking forward to 
this visit, and 60 percent view it as an appreciation of current 
developments in our country. Approximately 50 percent of the 
respondents consider the visit by the U.S. President to be an 
expression of appreciation for President Vaclav Havel. 
Approximately the same percentage of the respondents consider 
this event to be an important step that should lead to the 
strengthening of trade and economic relations between the Czech 
Republic and the United States. It is interesting to note that 
approximately half of the respondents were unable to answer the 
questions. 
  The DEMA company was also interested in President Clinton's 
popularity among Prague citizens. According to the survey, the 
pattern of his popularity is relatively the same in all age 
groups. However, women are looking forward to his visit to a 
greater extent than men, by 67 percent to 59 percent.

<F P=106> [Interview with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Roman </F>
Krasnicky in Prague; date not given: "The Free Trade Zone Is a 
Test of Cooperation"] 
  [Text] [Krasnicky] Czech-U.S. talks will be held next week. 
What do you want to say to Bill Clinton? 
  [Klaus] The security issue will be a dominant feature of 
these talks. Nevertheless, the Czech side would like to point 
out the inseparability of security and other issues and to 
emphasize the connections between security policy and general 
economic and social policy. We would also like to discuss how 
the Czech Republic views its future and cooperation with the 
United States. 
  [Krasnicky] People in Hungary and Poland are reproaching you 
for preferring bilateral talks with U.S. officials at the Prague 
meeting and not a joint course of action by the Visegrad Four 
states.... 
  [Klaus] These opinions reflect certain disappointment that 
the Americans chose Prague as the place to hold their meetings 
with these four countries. 
  I would not look for anything more profound in this. As far 
as cooperation among these four countries is concerned, we have 
said thousands of times that we favor cooperation in all spheres 
where it is suitable. We are placing extraordinary emphasis on 
the greatest test of cooperation. This test is not summits and 
meetings between presidents and prime ministers but the free 
trade zone. Here the Czech Republic is in the lead, while some 
other countries that would be glad to have highest-level summits 
are, compared with us, applying the brakes in intensifying the 
free trade zone. At the same time, this cooperation is in our 
most vital interest. 
  [Krasnicky] Our neighbors are interested in joining NATO. 
Their motive is obvious. Are you also concerned about Russian 
neoimperialism? 
  [Klaus] First, I would like to say that it was 
Czechoslovakia 
that told a somewhat surprised Poland and Hungary that we want 
to join NATO. This is a historically proven fact, and nothing in 
our conceptual decision has changed, except that in the Czech 
Republic today we are making less pointed statements. Second, we 
respect Partnership for Peace as an intermediary step, and our 
task is to make maximum use of this concept for partnership. The 
U.S. plan envisages the conclusion of individual treaties 
between NATO and the individual countries. These treaties will 
not be formulated unequivocally and will be able to 
differentiate more between the individual participants. There 
will be sufficient scope here for the Czech Republic to use this 
institute if, of course, it is adopted by NATO on 11 January. 
  [Krasnicky] What about the Russian threat? 
  [Klaus] Let us in no way underestimate it. However, I would 
not separate this threat from the whole issue. The Russian 
threat is not a military one. It is the threat of mastering--or 
of not mastering--the early postcommunist phase. This threat has 
social, economic, political, and, only at a certain point, 
military dimensions. At the same time, I concede that the Czech 
Republic is a little further toward the West than, for instance, 
Poland. This issue is more sensitive for the Poles than it is 
for the Austrians, for example. In this issue, I would place us 
more alongside Austria than Poland.

  [Text] Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has made a statement on 
the claim by Polish President Lech Walesa in today's LIDOVE 
NOVINY to the effect that the Czech side superimposes its 
interests above the joint aims of the countries of the Visegrad 
Group. Klaus says that the Czech side is neither an organizer 
nor an initiator of the Prague talks between President Clinton 
and political representatives of the four countries of Central 
Europe. The Czech side is merely happy to accept the U.S. 
initiative and welcomes the fact that these important talks will 
take place in Prague. 
  At the same time, Vaclav Klaus sees no reason for the 
failure 
of these talks. As he went on to say, the offer for him to 
deliver the joint viewpoint of the four countries mentioned by 
President Walesa was not made to Vaclav Klaus, and that is why 
he could not reject it. 
  I would be a very bad Czech politician, the prime minister 
continues, if I did not put Czech interests above the joint aims 
of the countries of the Visegrad Group. President Walesa is 
right about that. But I believe that he does not do that sort of 
thing. [as heard] The joint interests of the Visegrad Group 
countries are the highest common denominator of the interests of 
the individual countries, nothing more and nothing less. We 
would only make a mistake if we incorrectly interpreted our own 
long-term interests, Vaclav Klaus stresses in his viewpoint on 
Lech Walesa's LIDOVE NOVINY allegations. 
  President Vaclav Havel will not make any statement on the 
interview granted by Polish President Lech Walesa to LIDOVE 
NOVINY.

<F P=106> [Interview with Pavel Bratinka, deputy foreign minister of </F>
the Czech Republic, by Juergen Gottschlich and Tomas 
Niederberghaus; place and date not given: "The Shadows of 
Munich"] 
  [Excerpts] [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Mr. Bratinka, why is the 
Czech Republic so interested in becoming a member of NATO? 
  [Bratinka] NATO is a tested organization that has protected 
Western Europe against Soviet aggression for 40 years. It is an 
association of democratic countries that act on consensus. Even 
though today it is said that there is no threat in Europe at the 
moment, NATO is able to guarantee its members' security, 
regardless of where danger comes from. Think of the Gulf war. 
  No matter how things might look to you from the West, our 
region is anything but stable. People do not feel safe. The only 
organization that can provide security is NATO. However, we need 
NATO for still another reason: It keeps the United States in 
Europe. The past century has made it quite clear that Europe is 
a very dangerous place without the Americans. [passage omitted] 
  [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Is Russia a hostile country for you? 
  [Bratinka] Not at the moment. Our enemies are the 
nationalists, who attack each other and destabilize the region. 
  [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] But this is precisely what NATO cannot 
prevent. 
  [Bratinka] No, that is not true. As an organization, NATO 
would be able to intervene in the former Yugoslavia, but it is 
not ready to act. However, this is a discussion about what it 
should do and not what it would be able to do. Without the 
structure and experience of NATO, European security is 
inconceivable. 
  Our current problem is the general insecurity and the 
extremists from the various camps. Think of Zhirinovskiy in 
Russia. [passage omitted] 
  [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Why does the Czech Republic now try to 
pursue NATO membership on its own and no longer as a project of 
the Visegrad states? 
  [Bratinka] Well, because NATO will never accept countries 
that do not fulfill certain criteria. This will work only bit by 
bit. But this is not so bad. When a former communist country in 
Eastern Europe--I hope it will be my country--becomes a NATO 
member, this will have considerable effect on the entire region. 
Why? The West would then have crossed the Rubicon, would have 
moved from the sphere of beautiful words and vague promises to 
concrete deeds. 
  [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] And you believe that NATO will take the 
step across the Rubicon? 
  [Bratinka] We do not assume that we will get a membership 
certificate at the coming summit. However, we expect to see a 
light at the end of the tunnel, and this would be an encouraging 
development also for the other countries in the region. We 
envisage this development in two stages. First, a general 
decision. If this is positive, there will be a concrete process 
of different duration for the different East European countries. 
There, each country has to present itself; there the issue will 
be finances, armaments, and other problems, joint training, etc. 
We assume that NATO will recognize our accession as a gain for 
everyone. We do not want to be a stowaway in NATO, for whom 
others pay. 
  [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Is it conceivable for you that NATO will 
change to such an extent that Russia, too, is able to become a 
member of the club? 
  [Bratinka] Of course, NATO must take care to remain capable 
of action. Countries that want to be members should examine 
themselves as to whether they are willing to adjust to the rules 
of NATO and whether they are able to do so. If this is so, they 
should become members. No one will seriously claim today that 
Russia corresponds to these criteria. Let us wait and see. As 
soon as the Russians have concluded their reforms and stable 
institutions have developed, this question might make sense. 
  The West had better support the beginnings of democratic 
institutions in Russia now. Zhirinovskiy had $1 million 
available for his election campaign, far more than the 
democratic parties. Where are the billions and billions of 
dollars that the West has given to the Russian Government? The 
West should give grants to Russians so that they can accumulate 
experiences with the democratic system, so that as many people 
as possible learn in practice how parliamentary democracy 
actually works. [passage omitted] 
  [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] What would be an alternative to NATO? Why 
do the East European states not form their own alliance, which 
would then cooperate with NATO? 
  [Bratinka] NATO has the experience and the infrastructure, 
and, if every country makes its army compatible to NATO, the 
countries can automatically cooperate with each other. 
Therefore, joining NATO is the realistic path. Also for 
political reasons--think of the conflicts between Slovakia and 
Hungary--such an association, an alliance of East European 
states, would hardly be possible. In West Europe it worked only 
because the United States exerted a lot or pressure and the 
Soviet threat was so massive. No, this is no realistic path. 
  A message by NATO that says "we do not want you, solve your 
problems on your own" would be a disaster for the region. Above 
all, the reform states would slide into a big crisis. The 
democratic movements have all come to power with the slogan: Now 
we will again become a part of Europe, a part of the Western 
world. If the reformers are now betrayed, the hour of the 
nationalists will come--as it happened before in history. 
  [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] You speak of betrayal. Do we understand 
you correctly? You mean that if you now have to remain outside 
the door, this would be a repetition of Munich in 1938? 
  [Bratinka] Yes, exactly. For us it can be compared with the 
Munich Agreement and with the Treaty of Yalta. There are so many 
political desperados who are just waiting to sow unrest, to play 
up the Sudeten German issue, and to accuse the West of alleged 
mistakes in history. A rejection by the West would be like a 
shadow of Munich. 
  [DIE TAGESZEITUNG] Would you consider membership in NATO 
more 
important than membership in the European Union? 
  [Bratinka] These are two different problems, which cannot be 
discussed as alternatives. So far, no one has told us that we 
have to choose between membership in NATO or in the European 
Union. If this were the case, we would certainly have a heated 
debate with quite contrary preferences. So far, however, we have 
not been confronted with such a dilemma.

  [Excerpts] Regional cooperation between states, as well as 
our demonstrated unwillingness to join this cooperation with 
regard to security issues, was another much debated topic during 
the trip by Madelaine Albright and John Shalikashvili in the 
four states of Central and East Europe. Jiri Payne, chairman of 
the foreign committee of the Chamber of Deputies, told our 
correspondent Miroslav Repka the following: 
  [Begin recording] In your opinion, should the Czech Republic 
take an independent course of action in joining the Partnership 
for Peace project or should it be done jointly, within the 
Visegrad Group? 
  [Payne] The initiative itself is formulated in such a way 
that every state is to take an independent course of action. 
Every state has to decide for itself on the speed with which it 
wants to progress in the cooperation. [passage omitted] [end 
recording] 
  [Announcer] Jiri Dienstbier, former foreign minister and 
present chairman of the Free Democrats, voiced a somewhat 
different opinion on the participation of individual states of 
the Visegrad Group in the Partnership for Peace. 
  [begin Dienstbier recording] Of course, I believe that each 
of these Central European countries has to create its own 
internal conditions for joining the structures of the developed 
world, including NATO. However, I also strongly believe that, if 
these four countries take a joint course of action, they will, 
either jointly or individually, achieve this much sooner. If the 
four countries keep quarreling and outdoing each other while 
trying to prove who is better and who is worse, there is no 
guarantee of a desired achievement. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] A news conference about privatization took place 
in Prague today. Jitka Kucerova has more details. 
  [Kucerova] According to Roman Ceska, first deputy minister 
for the administration and privatization of the national 
property, 90 percent of the property earmarked for privatization 
has already undergone the approval procedure at the ministry and 
has been handed over to the National Property Fund. Revenues 
from both small- and large-scale privatization are estimated at 
54 billion korunas [Kc] so far. Mr. Ceska also said the small 
scale privatization was completed at the end of 1993. Any 
property remaining will be privatized by large-scale 
privatization methods. [passage omitted]

  [Text] At the end of November 1993, the Czech Republic 
state budget showed a surplus of 2.7 billion Czech korunas. This 
transpires from the data of the Czech Statistical Office 
released yesterday [10 January]. The number of unemployed has 
increased to 175,800, while the number of job vacancies has 
dropped to approximately 55,000. Thus, the number of unemployed 
was three times higher in November than the number of job 
vacancies. Two-thirds of the unemployed are workers. The 
unemployment rate was 3.34 percent.

  [Text] The subject of the usual weekly press briefing by 
the Hungarian Foreign Ministry was the summit of the Visegrad 
Group of countries. Geza Jeszenszky's ideas, which he outlined 
before leaving [for the Prague meeting], have been summed up by 
Jozsef Barath. 
  [Barath] The series of meetings in Prague and the 
negotiations of leaders of the Visegrad states with President 
Clinton and with each other will strengthen the cooperation of 
the Visegrad Group members -- cooperation which derives from the 
shared fate of the Central European countries. This was said by 
[Foreign Minister] Geza Jeszenszky at his news briefing, which 
is still in progress. 
  In the foreign minister's view, the Partnership for Peace is 
one of the important stages on the road to NATO. The current 
NATO summit is similar in significance to the decisions in 
Copenhagen last summer on the long-term possibility of joining 
the European Union. Geza Jeszenszky emphasized that the current 
summit dispelled anxieties about the possibility that NATO's 
function might cease. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has 
fulfilled the security vacuum which has developed in our region, 
he said. 
  The foreign minister welcomed President Clinton's 
confirmation that the United States has important interests 
linked to Central Europe. The 16 NATO states pledged their 
support for NATO's expansion.

a member of the Council of Europe for more than two years and we 
have observer status in the Western European Union. On the 
other hand, there are a number of problems in the economic 
sphere. Many of the Western companies that enter our market, 
unfortunately, suspend production in a number of branches 
instead of concentrating on restructuring outdated capacities. 
We receive second- or third-rate technology from the West. In 
some cases, this technology represents a risk to the 
environment. On the other hand, the opportunities we have for 
gaining access to Western markets are somewhat limited. This, 
however, makes no difference to our priorities. Improving 
relations with its neighbors is another key issue for Hungary 
and its security. Our main objective is to achieve a historic 
settlement. We have to agree that the issue of the borders and 
the historic peace treaties is closed for us. Nevertheless, we 
desire -- or request -- that the rights of the Hungarian 
minorities in neighboring countries be respected. There can 
only be a real improvement in relations if these two aspects are 
combined. Apart from this, we should not allow economic 
cooperation to be limited hereafter to neighboring countries, 
although, following the collapse of CEMA [Council for Mutual 
Economic Assistance] and the Warsaw Pact, this is -- to a 
certain extent -- a natural phenomenon. 
  [Zizka] Do you also regard the Czech Republic as a neighbor? 
  [Horn] Yes, it is an indirect neighbor; there are 
significant traditions here from the era of the former 
Czechoslovakia. In view of the difficulties in cooperation with 
the West, we should pay more attention to the economic 
integration of Central Europe. The first step should be the 
establishment of joint banks, joint enterprises, and the 
expansion of mutual trade. Whether the specific form of 
expanding trade is considered modern or not is not so important. 
If possible, it is necessary to implement a form of barter. It 
is important to find a market for our products. If our party 
assumes responsibility for the government after the next 
elections, it will definitely pursue a very active policy toward 
our neighbors. 
  [Zizka] Nevertheless, if you are talking about improving 
relations with your neighbors, then -- obviously -- you are not 
happy with current government policy. 
  [Horn] Two sides bear responsibility for the current 
situation -- not only Hungary. Understandably, some of our 
representatives should avoid making speeches that offend our 
neighbors. However, the representatives of neighboring states 
should also somewhat alter their stance toward us. As a 
representative of one of the left-wing parties in Hungary, I 
would like to point out that the Socialist International has 
incorporated into its program a item on guaranteeing collective 
rights for minorities. Guaranteeing linguistic and cultural 
autonomy and self-administration still does not automatically 
mean separatism. 
  [Zizka] What, then, is the difference between your party and 
the government in the minority issue? 
  [Horn] In principle, there are no major differences here. I 
think our policy would be imprinted with greater activity. It 
is essential to approach mutual talks more actively and to 
initiate specific proposals for improving relations. That would 
probably be the main difference. 
  [Zizka] What is your party's view regarding the initiative 
by local organs in south Slovakia to establish an autonomous 
Hungarian region? 
  [Horn] It is necessary to specify exactly what comes under 
the demand for autonomy. In my opinion, this would mean that 
they could really make decisions on the issues that concern 
them. The majority of people in this region are Hungarians. It 
is logical, therefore, that they are demanding something that is 
already standard in Europe. 
  [Zizka] You said you regard the Czech Republic as an 
indirect 
neighbor. Not long ago, however, you proposed that a regional 
group be established comprising Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, and 
Austria -- but not the Czech Republic. 
  [Horn] For some time I have been of the opinion that the 
Czech Republic is not very interested in the Visegrad Group. 
This was perhaps due to the fact that your representatives 
wanted to distance themselves a little from our region. I 
understand this; there are many conflicts here and perhaps it is 
better for the Czech Republic not to be here. Maybe Czech 
representatives feel that, if they do not enter into the initial 
stages of integration with us, they will be able to integrate 
themselves more quickly into West Europe. Your Prime Minister 
Klaus has made a number of statements in this regard. On the 
other hand, however, we bear in mind the fact that you signed 
the free trade zone agreement in Krakow. 
  [Zizka] The opinion prevails in Prague that the original 
aims of the Visegrad Group have already been fulfilled. 
President Havel has also said this. 
  [Horn] In my opinion, it is impossible to describe any aim 
as 
fulfilled. Economic cooperation has just begun and we still 
have far to go before this aim is fulfilled. It is necessary to 
maintain and further develop the Visegrad Group's activity. It 
would be desirable to include other countries -- Slovenia and 
Croatia, especially if the war there comes to an end. The 
participation of Austria is very important. The issue involves 
cooperation throughout the entire Central European region. 
  [Zizka] You proposed recently that the Hungarian parliament 
begin discussing the issue of entry into NATO. At the same 
time, however, you emphasize that this must be decided in a 
referendum. 
  [Horn] I suggested this because many people doubt that 
joining NATO would be beneficial to our country and even 
consider it to be a bad move. It is not true that there would 
be a nationwide consensus on this issue. I was intent on making 
sure that parliament considers this issue. It does not only 
depend on the people understanding what NATO membership will 
mean. It is such a serious matter that it is impossible for any 
government to request admission without the prior agreement of 
parliament. As far as a definitive, official request for 
admission is concerned, in my opinion, it has to be preceded by 
a referendum. 
  [Zizka] What is your party's view on possible entry? 
  [Horn] I, for example, am definitely in favor. As foreign 
minister, I made a statement at the beginning of 1990 in which I 
called for closer relations with NATO, relations that would 
result in membership. This met with great opposition from many 
people. In the end, the right wing also added its support to 
entry. I think many people do not realize what NATO membership 
actually means. It is necessary to clarify this in 
parliamentary discussions and to consider the commitments and 
rights arising from it. 
  [Zizka] The Americans have come up with the "Partnership for 
Peace" security initiative. What do you think of it? 
  [Horn] I have reservations about it. This proposal is in 
fact a temporary solution. It is intended to show us the 
workings of NATO, how we could restructure our armed forces, and 
the kind of commitments arising for us from mutual cooperation. 
I am not explicitly opposed to it, but I have no illusions in 
this context. It is -- sui generis -- a manifestation of the 
fact that the NATO countries also do not know what to do with 
Central and Eastern Europe. On the one hand, they are aware of 
the great pressure from our countries and of the request for 
security guarantees. On the other hand, they are hesitating; 
they do not want to provoke Moscow. They will be even more 
cautious following the recent events in Russia. It will be a 
long time before we have real security guarantees in our region. 
  [Zizka] You said that you do not rule out the possibility 
that your party will enter into government after the elections. 
Are you anticipating this? 
  [Horn] Everything depends on the election results. This is 
the key issue for us. If we achieve a result entitling us to 
participate in the government, we will assume the 
responsibility. It will also depend on whether we reach an 
agreement on the main policy issues with a potential coalition 
partner. 
  [Zizka] Are there potential coalition partners? 
  [Horn] Of course. Those who are now in the opposition -- 
the Union of Free Democrats and the Union of Young Democrats, 
FIDESZ. Smaller opposition parties, for example, the Republican 
Party, the Agrarian Union, and so on are also being taken into 
consideration. That is, those who give priority to pragmatism 
and resolving specific problems over ideology. 
  [Zizka] However, FIDESZ representatives are not displaying 
much willingness about entering into a coalition with you. 
  [Horn] They have not issued any such statement. They have 
merely said that they do not want to form a preelection 
coalition with us. This is understandable; we also do not want 
this. A government coalition is something else, however. It is 
a matter for the future.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Endre Aczel: "The Czechs' Separate Way"] </F>
  [Text] If the "Visegrad Group" has no common position for 
President Clinton in Prague -- and it will not have one because 
of a lack of coordination -- this will in effect mean that the 
Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia have different 
ideas about the framework of their cooperation with NATO and 
about occupying this framework. 
  It is justifiable to say that this is not a decisive 
viewpoint because, after all, it makes no difference what the 
applying parties want from the club if its statutes and rules 
have been laid down without them and will not be changed for 
their sake. 
  However, it is an essential viewpoint that the "Visegrad" 
countries do not wish to take a common stand or act as a "group 
exercising pressure" on behalf of their own future and, let us 
admit, this does not strengthen their position. Even if the 
assertion of the will originating from this side would be 
extremely limited anyway. 
  The lack of such a will is basically to be found in the 
attitude of the Czech Republic, or more exactly in the attitude 
of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus. I would like to remind readers 
that the independent Czech Republic was exactly five days old 
when, in an interview given to LE FIGARO, Klaus expressed his 
lack of interest in the "Visegrad" cooperation, and made it 
clear that, by becoming independent, the Czech Republic did not 
only "get rid" of the Slovaks, but also of Poland and Hungary. 
Consequently, the Czech Republic does not want to share the 
common label that might characterize the "Visegrad" Group in one 
way or another either at the NATO level or the EC level. In 
Klaus's view, such a label would harm the Czech Republic. 
  It would harm them, because Klaus regards his own republic 
as 
being in a much better condition than Poland or Hungary; as for 
Slovakia, he does not even consider it worth mentioning. I would 
not comment on this view but, from the viewpoint of NATO 
membership, I would point out the advantageous situation 
obviously enjoyed by the Czech Republic. A glance at the map is 
sufficient to show that, of the "Visegrad" countries, only the 
Czech Republic has no direct borders with the former Soviet 
Union; consequently, Moscow, which continues to think in 
"empire" terms, can have much less of a quarantine feeling in 
connection with the affiliation of the Czech Republic than with 
the possible NATO membership of Hungary, Poland, or Slovakia. 
  In other words, if Moscow's sensitivity is the basic reason 
for NATO's reluctance to accept the "Visegrad" Group, then the 
Czech Republic, which is in a geopolitically favorable position, 
is the least to blame for causing this sensitivity. 
  However, one can easily predict that, after the NATO summit 
and for the time being, the "Visegrad" countries will fall under 
the "uniform label" so much criticized by Klaus; it is 
unimaginable that the NATO would offer more to the Czechs than 
to us, for example. However, this will definitely not hinder 
Vaclav Klaus in continuing his tough struggle for the priority 
of the Czech Republic, and it is to be feared that, just like 
the Poles, Hungarian diplomacy will seek "sponsors" for the same 
thing. For quite some time, Brzezinski called Poland "candidate 
number one" and we should also consider the strong Polish lobby 
in the United States. 
  To unsuspicious eyes, the "summit" in Prague could give the 
impression that "Visegrad" -- an existing formation -- is 
actually not something alive and its members are not bound by a 
solidarity of the type of "either together or not at all." And 
the selfish and arrogant Klaus is to be blamed for all this.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mihailo Nicota: "Two Singles on Turbulent </F>
Kupa River"] 
  [Text] Do you think that war might break out between 
Croatia and Slovenia? And if such a war were to break out, do 
you think we could win? Some two months ago the Ljubljana 
weekly MLADINA conducted a public opinion poll asking its 
readership these two questions. A large majority of Slovenes 
who took part in the poll, some 57.5 percent of them, do not 
think that a war between the two neighboring countries could 
break out, but as many as 31.8 percent fear that it might yet 
happen. However, while answering the second question a majority 
of respondents, though not an absolute majority, that is 48 
percent, believed in Slovenia's victory, while only 13 percent 
believed the opposite! 
  Obviously, given the choice between realism and patriotism, 
the majority of Slovenes chose the latter, although it seems 
that in Slovenia, at least officially, just as in Croatia 
somewhat earlier, there now prevails the phase of a return to 
reality. To be more precise: In Slovenia one notices a strange 
discrepancy between the official policy of the coalition 
government, which is endeavoring to be objective, realistic, and 
moderate, and the Slovene media, which, with the assistance of 
some right-wing opposition politicians, are maintaining the high 
temperature with a sort of anti-Croatian campaign, full of 
exaggerations and fabrications. 
  Therefore one has to keep in mind that MLADINA conducted the 
poll with this campaign in full swing. Its climax seems to be 
the recently announced results of another public opinion poll, 
in which the Slovene respondents said for the first time that 
the Croats were their greatest enemies, and that a major 
disaster threatened them from the Croats, rather than -- the 
Serbs! Such statements are very well supplemented by the 
threats delivered by Zmago Jelincic, the leader of a nationalist 
party, not only at rallies and through the media, but also in 
the Slovene parliament. Recently he even announced in Zagreb's 
GLOBUS a forthcoming war between the Croats and Slovenes. Of 
course, Zmago the celebrity (his name translated means "victor") 
throws no doubts whatsoever upon the Slovene victory in the war 
that will be started by the Croats, since, as Jelincic 
definitely knows, a group of experts in the Croatian Army is 
planning an attack on Slovenia! It is true that the nationalist 
madness sometimes knows no limits, but it is also certain that 
the insane campaign carried out by some Slovene media, as well 
as the performances of some politicians, do not reflect the real 
disposition of public opinion, and particularly the official 
policy on Croatia. Nevertheless, the fact is: Croato-Slovene 
relations have been through many turbulent phases of rises and 
falls. 
  In short, in two and half years, first in the period up to 
25 
July 1991, when both Croatia and Slovenia declared themselves 
sovereign and independent states, after which they recognized 
each other as such, and then after that historic date, those 
relations evolved from the initial high temperature, euphoria, 
and romantic phase, when their close future was seen as joint, 
through sudden estrangement and open disputes, up to a near 
freezing point, verging on animosity. So, those relations, 
instead of being friendly and neighborly, are now rather 
encumbered with mistrust and disputes. 
  At the beginning of the way into independence -- in the 
struggle to crush Yugoslavia to and self-liberation, and later 
also in the first days of independence -- Croatia and Slovenia 
gave the impression of a well-harmonized rowing crew (without a 
cox) that skillfully rowed, and dodged around dangerous 
obstacles on the Kupa, that is Kolpa [in Slovene], and the 
Sutla, that is Sotla [in Slovene], rivers (these two form the 
border between these neighboring countries). However, the crew 
fell apart, and two rowers took separate ways. Such an outcome 
was largely influenced by the Yugoslav, that is the Serbian, 
aggression, at first against Slovenia, than against Croatia, and 
finally against Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The war brought about a drastically different situation for 
the two young states: It disconnected their destinies, showed 
them the differences in their interests, and introduced more 
problems and disputes that originate from former Yugoslavia, but 
the majority of them were still prompted by the new situation, 
and the historical fact that Croatia and Slovenia had become 
independent states. That imposed an obligation and 
responsibility on the newly constituted authorities to settle 
independently the many difficult problems that are not identical 
in both states. Those problems are certainly much more 
difficult in Croatia because of the consequences of the war. 
  Unfortunately, Slovenia failed to show enough 
understanding, patience, and solidarity with these problems, 
while Croatia, perhaps unjustifiably, expected too much from its 
neighbor. So that in the course of 1992 Croato-Slovene relations 
dramatically cooled and deteriorated. This last year, 1993, in 
which various negotiations on different levels were held, is 
also over, but still it did not bring about any more 
considerable steps forward, although on several occasions it 
appeared that a dramatic turn toward an improvement of relations 
in general, as well as on individual points, was almost at hand. 
  This refers to the following event: After the meetings 
between Slovene President Kucan and his Croatian counterpart 
Tudjman (on the hill of Brdo kod Kranja in October 1992), 
between [foreign ministers] Lojze Peterle and Skrabalo (in the 
town of Otocec na Krki in February 1993), and between Peterle 
and Mate Granic (in Bizeljsko, October 1993), both sides were 
issuing quite optimistic statements to the effect that almost 
all the problems had been solved, and that the signing of a 
whole series of agreements would follow that were quite 
important for the establishment of neighborly and friendly 
relations. However, on each of the three occasions everything 
stopped. One gets the impression, at least from a brief insight 
in the development of mutual relations, that in 1993 no 
considerable progress came about. Does that mean that the past 
year was yet another lost year? 
  This first impression is deceptive, however. The worst and 
most critical period seems to have been surmounted: The 
precipitating decline of Croat-Slovene relations has been 
halted, and they have entered a phase of "a return to reality." 
The two individuals on the Kupa and Sutla rivers will probably 
never form a rowing team again, but now they are at least trying 
not to disturb the water, and to row without colliding with each 
other or capsizing. Anglers and swimmers on the Croatian bank 
of the Kupa River can be at ease again: For the time being they 
do not have to fear that the former's bait would hit another 
part of the river, or that the latter would not be allowed to 
swim across it. The two individuals on the Kupa and Sutla 
rivers are quite well personified by two people with whom we 
talkedh: Matija Malesic, Slovene ambassador to Zagreb, and 
Smiljan Simac, aide of the Croatian foreign minister, who is 
responsible for relations with European countries. Both of 
them, in separate talks with DANAS, tried to cool the game down, 
and to keep the ball somewhat lower. To the assessment that the 
1993 was yet another lost year, that nothing remarkable happened 
in Croato-Slovene relations, both Malesic and Simac 
categorically denied it: No, that is not true! 
  On that occasion they gave two pieces of evidence that 
relations are still improving. First, so far a total of seven 
agreements, contracts, protocols, and annexes have been signed. 
It is not so striking a number, and they do not deal with any 
of more important issues that are still being disputed and are 
still muddying the waters of the Kupa and Sutla rivers. Yet, it 
is proof that the neighbors have finally accepted the principle 
that problems are to be solved step by step. And that is a more 
reliable way than dealing with all the problems at once, in 
packages. Or to put it symbolically: The two individuals are 
harmonizing their courses. 
  All the more since, second, the meetings on different 
political and expert levels are constantly taking place, at 
which, also step by step, the sides are trying to remove 
obstacles and reach agreements. Reportedly, several important 
agreements have already been prepared: On cultural cooperation, 
employment, health security, and railroad communications. For 
that reason both Malesic and Simac speak of a standstill in 
mutual relations, rather than a deterioration. Still, they dare 
not make any forecasts when a radical breakthrough from that 
standstill could be made. Obviously, the existing disputes are 
still difficult and there are no considerable signs of optimism, 
but, therefore, realistic thinking seems to be firmly 
established. 
<H5>  [Box, pp 38-39] </H5>
  In the entire history of Croat-Slovene relations the 
toughest 
realist, with traces of pessimism, seems to be Dr. Radovan 
Pavic, an eminent geo-strategist and geopolitician, who saw 
Slovenia as early as last spring as a potential barrier to 
Croatia's land connections with Central, northern, and Western 
Europe. This professor from Zagreb believes that Croatia and 
Slovenia, in view of their economic structures and geographic 
positions, can be nothing but permanent rivals, even after a 
possible settlement of the majority of problems is made. Still, 
according to Pavic, only good will can reduce all of that to the 
most civil relations possible. 
  And, as we have seen, good will exists on both sides. From 
the brief insight into the documents prepared by Zagreb and 
Ljubljana for the new round of negotiations, perhaps even for 
those at the highest level, one gets the impression that a 
considerable number of problems in mutual relations have been 
surmounted. Still, several disputed issues are still hampering 
relations. Those are territorial-border, economic-proprietary, 
and communications issues regarding the territory between the 
Slovene coastal town of Piran and the nuclear power station of 
Krsko. 
  The bay of Piran. The border disputes have been settled in 
95 percent of the cases, mostly by following the principle of 
natural borders (like the Kupa and Sutla rivers), and the 
so-called land registry districts. One dispute has remained 
unsettled: the destiny of the bay of Piran. Or more precisely, 
the sea border is disputed. Croatia has accepted that the 
border along the St. Odorik Channel at the mouth of the Dragonja 
River should be determined according to the international 
practice of equidistance. However, in that case sovereignty 
over the bay is shared, and Slovenia loses the approach to the 
open seas. Although Croatia is offering a whole range of 
privileges regarding shipping and fishing, the Slovenes would 
like to have control over the entire bay, as they did in the 
times of the former Yugoslavia. 
  The Sentilj-Zagreb highway. That route is of vital 
importance for Croatia, as well as for some other European 
countries. It should be constructed as soon as possible in 
cooperation with Slovenia, given the foreign (Austrian) 
investment. However, the Slovenes consider their priority to be 
the route from Koper via Ljubljana via Celje to the Hungarian 
border, and for the time being they are not likely to satisfy 
Croatian interests. On the other hand, Zagreb is linking the 
issue with the settlement of the dispute over the Piran bay. 
  Economic and proprietary-legal relations. A whole string of 
unsettled proprietary problems is tightly bound up with the 
standstill and even decline of economic and business 
cooperation. In just one year, for instance, Croatian exports to 
Slovenia have dropped by 35 percent, whereas Slovene exports to 
Croatia have dropped by 25 percent. For such a situation one of 
the factors responsible is the disputed method of payment in 
exchange between these two countries, but agreement has also 
been made difficult by many unsettled proprietary-legal 
relations, or to be more precise, the unclear destiny of 
state-ownership, from the Slovene resorts on the Adriatic coast 
to Ljubljanska Banka. 
  The Krsko nuclear power station. Slovenia has recently 
dismissed 19 Croatian employees, and threatened the suspension 
of the delivery of power from Krsko to Croatia, because Zagreb 
has not yet paid its debts. However, the Slovene Government 
also owes money to Krsko, whereas the ownership of Krsko is 
shared between Slovenia and Croatia in a 50-50 relationship. 
The dispute might end up in the International Court.

<F P=106> [Interview with Romanian Defense Minister Niculae Spiroiu by </F>
unidentified Radio Romania reporter in Bucharest on 10 January 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Minister Niculae Spiroiu, the summit 
meeting of the NATO member countries is currently taking place 
in Brussels. What is your opinion about the solution proposed 
by the Partnership for Peace to the East European countries and 
about a possible access of our country to the North Atlantic 
Alliance? 
  [Spiroiu] Well, there have been long preparations for that 
meeting. As you know, there was also a meeting at Travemunde in 
October. This is a meeting whose importance is determined by 
the fact that, in practical terms, it will make official -- so 
to say -- a viewpoint of the Alliance about the future of the 
Alliance and mainly about the future position regarding the 
acceptance of Central and Eastern European countries in NATO. 
As is known, I have already mentioned it before that it is not 
the Romanian Army that joins NATO, but Romania, and this is 
Romania's foreign policy promoted by the competent bodies as 
stipulated by the Constitution. The Army and the Ministry of 
National Defense do nothing else but follow this foreign policy 
and thus prepare the necessary elements to enable our military 
body to integrate into the security structures that it will 
join, namely NATO, the Western European Union, as well as other 
structures. Thus, it is important for the Romanian Army that, 
by following Romania's foreign policy, it should make the 
necessary preparations for ensuring the compatibility of our 
military body with the military bodies of the countries that 
belong to the Alliance. Here I am referring to compatibility in 
the area of structures, the decisionmaking system, political 
control of civilian society over the military field, training 
programs, and ultimately also the equipment, an element that 
will be achieved gradually, as soon as necessary conditions will 
be created for it. In this respect one might say that the reform 
process in the Army that has been carefully prepared -- 
preparations for this reform finalized at around the end of 1992 
and its implementation started as early as 1993 -- and includes 
all these areas, starting with the legislative area up to the 
other areas that I have mentioned before, does nothing else but 
make our military body ready so that when the political decision 
for our country to join the NATO or the security structures, 
even on the basis of partnership is taken, we should be prepared 
for it. 
  All I can say is that the Army has taken steps in this 
direction. Certainly, the Partnership for Peace elevates to a 
new level the partnership that has existed so far within the 
North Atlantic Cooperation Council [NACC], that was set up after 
1991, that is, after November 1991. Why am I saying that it 
elevates the partnership to a new level? Because, this time we 
are no longer talking about a collective relation, that is, to 
join collectively these programs within the NACC, but about a 
bilateral option, namely, the option of each state to have 
access to this Partnership for Peace, certainly by fulfilling 
certain conditions. And all I can tell you is the fact that 
what we have been doing in the field of reforming the military 
body is perfectly valid also for the Partnership for Peace. 
Thus, if the meeting that is taking place today and tomorrow in 
Brussels and that is attended by heads of states and governments 
will adopt this idea of Partnership for Peace, I believe that 
Romania, and mainly the Romanian Army -- since I can only talk 
on behalf of the Army -- will fulfill the necessary conditions 
to enable the competent political bodies to take steps toward 
this partnership on a bilateral basis for peace. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Minister, do you believe that it is desirable 
to have one step or several steps in the process of joining NATO? 
  [Spiroiu] It would be a great mistake to have several steps. 
I have already stated, if I am not mistaken in the interview 
that I granted to the daily ROMANIA LIBERA, or even in the 
newspaper of the government that any type of discrimination 
would create distrust and suspicion again and would bring about 
a feeling of marginalization or isolation, which would be 
counterproductive in view of the establishment of security in 
this area. Thus, I believe -- but I have to repeat that the 
decision rests with the political bodies -- that every country 
should have equal security in this area, without discrimination, 
without new frontiers, a sphere of security in which one should 
take into account the interests of Russia and the independence 
of Ukraine. In general, I personally believe that these are 
very important elements for the establishment of European 
regional security, thus the zone that includes also Romania. 
Thus, this is very important.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Madelaine Albright and John 
Shalikashvili started their talks in Prague by meeting Prime 
Minister Vaclav Klaus. The content of the talks was aimed at 
assessing the U.S. project Partnership for Peace. According to 
the prime minister, the project is valued by the Czech 
Government for the broad and liberal approach it offers its 
participants. U.S. interest in the development of regional 
cooperation, which, according to Madelaine Albright, is as 
important as the Czech Republic's good relations with the United 
States, was also debated. 
  [Begin Klaus recording] I think the American side 
understands 
that if we protest sometimes it is rather a protest against 
certain empty regionalism, against artificial concepts that lead 
nowhere. As for real and good regional relations, we, I believe, 
say clearly yes. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Budapest, 7 January (MTI) -- The Hungarian 
Democratic Forum (MDF) continues to exclude the possibility of 
forming coalitions with any successor parties of the former 
Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, MDF Vice-President and 
Parliamentary Group Head Ferenc Kulin told reporters in Budapest 
on Friday [7 January]. 
  During the 1994 electoral campaign, Hungary's main coalition 
party will do its utmost to prevent the Hungarian Socialist 
Party (MSZP) from having the chance to form a government, he 
said. 
  The MDF does not want to enter into coalition with parties 
which disagree with its nationally-committed policy and do not 
recognize the values of a conservative center-right policy, 
Kulin asserted. 
  Asked by MTI, the politician thought it impossible for the 
MDF to make a coalition with the Alliance of Free Democrats. 
Any further guesses were meaningless -- the MDF would not look 
at alliances with other parties before knowing election results.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 8 -- "In times of an extremely complex 
international situation and in conditions when the old world 
order no longer exists, there is an urgent need to create a new 
concept of security system, both the global and European one," 
the presidium of the main board of the Social Democracy of the 
Republic of Poland (SDRP) said Saturday presenting its stand on 
the "Partnership for Peace" plan. 
  The SDRP Presidium stressed such a system should not be 
aimed 
against anybody but has to function effectively in order to 
solve the existing conflicts and counteract potential threats 
and international crises. 
  In this context, the SDRP said it supported Poland's 
strivings for joining NATO and added that from the point of view 
of Poland's interests it considered the "Partnership for Peace" 
a step in the right direction though not a fully sufficient one. 
The SDRP said that the initiative needs to be appropriately 
specified and Poland should actively participate in this process. 
  "We believe that the content of the "Partnership for Peace," 
which will be specified with the participation of all the 
interested parties, will produce a system of mutual links which 
will provide solid foundations for a common and effective 
security system on the European continent. We are aware of the 
significance of Russia's participation in this extremely 
important process," the SDRP said and added that it was 
particularly important to create a favourable and constructive 
political climate around the initiative so that the "Partnership 
for Peace" plan could ensure security and stability of 
democratic development to the states participating in the 
process.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 8 -- The Presidium of the Democratic 
Union (UD) said in a statement issued Saturday that Poland's 
efforts to join NATO inaugurated by Solidarity governments as 
well as similar actions by other countries of the Visegrad Group 
should be continued with full consistency. The UD Presidium 
also declared it supported actions of the Polish president 
serving this goal. 
  "It is of great significance for our region, and in the long 
run for the entire European situation, to ensure security to the 
countries which overthrew the communist rule having liquidated 
in this way the division of the world into political blocs. 
NATO countries, Western Europe and the U.S. should be conscious 
of moral obligations in this field towards Poland and our part 
of Europe and know how to translate them into political 
decisions," the statement read. 
  "The UD has on many occasions supported the development of 
good political, economic and cultural relations between Poland 
and Russia as well as the idea of reconciliation between our two 
nations. Thus it firmly disapproves of statements by Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy which are designed to poison Polish-Russian and 
Polish-German relations," the statement read and stressed it 
should be a warning for the democratic world.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 10 -- Leader of the Confederation for 
an Independent Poland (KPN) Leszek Moczulski said Monday that 
Poland's possible acceptance of the "Partnership for Peace" 
programme means "deluding oneself." 
  Moczulski proposed that Poland should rather take care of 
its 
own Armed Forces. According to Moczulski, Poland's policy 
related to the NATO membership has focused on reaching certain 
propagandist goals. It produced no positive results in the past 
several years but halted the country's defence preparations. 
  "One should have at least rebuilt the army to make it 
capable 
of counteracting threats we may encounter," Moczulski said.

  [Text] Warsaw, 10 Jan -- According to Longin Pastusiak, the 
American Partnership for Peace proposal brings Poland closer to 
cooperation with NATO. 
  Pastusiak, who is heading the permanent delegation of the 
Polish Sejm to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, in an interview 
with a PAP journalist, assessed the American proposal 
"relatively positive," although, in his opinion, it does not 
fully meet Poland's aspirations to NATO membership. 
  Pastusiak said that the "partnership" will be a "litmus 
test" 
of intentions of the countries aspiring to membership in the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization. As part of this 
"partnership" each of the countries will present its proposals 
for NATO membership. In this way the status of cooperation of 
various states with NATO will be diversified and it will be 
revealed which of them are really interested in such 
cooperation, he emphasized. 
  According to Pastusiak, persistent "knocking on NATO's door" 
may cause irritation in the West, and in Poland it may lead to 
society's disappointment with the West and NATO.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 6 -- Overcoming the crisis in the 
public finances is the most important, long-term aim of 
government financial policy, Deputy Prime minister Marek 
Borowski told the Sejm on Thursday. 
  Borowski, presenting to the Sejm the governments draft 
budget 
for 1994, said that the size of the planned deficit at 83 
trillion zlotys (about 3.8 billion dollars) was "within the 
boundaries of the possibility of its financing by the banks." He 
also noted that servicing Poland's foreign and domestic debt in 
1994 would amount to 112 trillion zlotys out of total forecast 
expenditure of 693 trillion zlotys. Gross domestic product 
should rise by about 4.5 percent, he noted. 
  Borowski told the chamber that the aim of the budget was to 
further reduce inflation to 27 percent by mid-year and 23 
percent by December, to accelerate the tempo of economic growth 
and the growth in exports, and to limit cuts in the public 
sector. Also, support for agriculture would be increased. 
  The public sector is likely to absorb about half of total 
expenditure, but radical improvements in this sector can only 
come after fundamental reforms of the social security and health 
systems. He said that the government would present draft 
proposals on social security by June, and proposals to reform 
the system of family benefit payments would be presented by the 
end of the first quarter of 1994. 
  Borowski also announced that the government is considering 
plans to introduce a small levy on stock-market transactions, 
and is also examining the possibility of taxing stock-market 
earnings. Critics of the government who are demanding this, and 
are looking for major inflows from such a tax "treat the issue 
as a test of the governments leftism." 
  In his opinion, however, the government had more to gain 
from 
seeing the continued growth of the stock market, since this 
would help to accelerate the introduction of new companies onto 
the exchange. He noted that the successful recent flotation of 
Bank Slaski (BSK) had brought over 3 trillion zlotys (about 140 
million dollars) to the State Treasury. If income tax is 
levied, it could result in a fall in share prices, and thus a 
fall, rather than an increase, in budget revenues," he said. 
  Also addressing the Sejm, National Bank of Poland (NBP) 
President Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz said that the draft budget 
"illustrated in all its drama the problem of servicing the 
public debt." If the public debt is financed by increasing the 
state's debt with the banks, this amounts to the emission of 
uncovered money - ie, inflation. She added that the NBP was 
concerned that a lack of control over rising budget outgoings 
could lead to a short-term increase in inflation. 
  The NBP president also dismissed as "harmful and in no way 
justifiable," speculation that there might be a deep devaluation 
of the Polish zloty. In 1993 Poland fulfilled all the criteria 
in her agreements with the World Bank, including the rebuilding 
of the foreign currency reserves. She emphasised that it is not 
anticipated there will be changes to exchange-rate policy. 
  Earlier on Thursday, Ms Gronkiewicz-Waltz said in a radio 
interview that since October, Poland's foreign currency reserves 
had been held steady at 300 million dollars.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 7 -- Senator Zbigniew Religa, Poland's 
renowned heart surgeon, was unanimously elected new chairman of 
the Non-Party Reform Bloc (BBWR) association during a General 
Assembly of the association's's founding members on Friday. The 
new chairman declared that the Non-Party Reform Bloc was in 
opposition to the government but not in opposition to all its 
proposals. 
  The General Assembly granted the title of BBWR Honorary 
Member to President Lech Walesa. 
  Addressing a press conference after the meeting Religa 
declared that the BBWR association can be expected to become 
before its first congress in May "one of the two strongest 
political organizations in Poland". He announced that he will 
present the bloc's political assumptions on January 22. 
  Religa also said that Lech Walesa will be the bloc's 
candidate in the next presidential elections "if he decides to 
run". If not, the bloc will try to put forth its own candidate, 
too. Religa stressed that the BBWR association is not "a 
presidential association for a concrete person but one of its 
main features is the support for a presidential-parliamentary 
system." 
  According to Religa the BBWR association may become 
transformed into a political party in the future but at present 
the formula of an association is the most convenient since it 
allows to unite people of different views for the purpose of 
reforming the country. 
  Religa announced that Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski 
declared his will to join the BBWR association but that he will 
not hold any posts in it. 
  Asked by journalists whether his political activity did not 
interfere with his professional duties, Religa replied that it 
did but stressed that "in Poland it will not be proper for a 
long time yet to avoid politics." 
  "I think it to be my duty and an absolutely justified thing 
to engage in politics," he said. He said that the clinic in 
Zabrze which he is heading performs some 600 open heart 
surgeries and he himself makes some 150 surgeries every year. 
  The BBWR association's members are grouped in 121 circles 
throughout Poland.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 7 -- The Sejm (lower house) approved on 
Friday a new copyright law conforming with Western standards. 
The House voted 408 to one against, with one abstention. 
  The law covers all types of intellectual property, including 
video material and computer programmes, and extends copyright 
protection to distributors and broadcasters. The law also 
extends copyright to 50 years after the death of the initiator. 
  The law also envisages the creation of a fund for promotion 
of creative output, supervised by the minister of culture, and 
financed by payments from material out of copyright, and from a 
3-percent levy on audio- and video-cassettes. It is also 
intended that new organisations will be established to oversee 
the copyright regulations. 
  Under the proposals, prison sentences of 2-5 years may be 
imposed for copyright infringements. Heavy fines, and 
confiscation of illegal copying equipment, are also envisaged. 
The law now passes to the Senate for approval. When all 
legislative hurdles have been negotiated, the new law will 
become effective after three months.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 8 -- The political committee of the 
Christian National Union (ZChN) criticised the governments 
budget proposals and called for the intensification of moves 
towards the integration of Polands right wing political 
groupings, in a statement released after its meeting in Warsaw 
on Saturday. 
  The ZChN leaders think that the right wing unity is 
necessary 
because of an offensive from the left aiming at "far reaching 
political and ideological transformations" in Poland and because 
the local government elections are due soon. 
  ZChN President Wieslaw Chrzanowski said at the press 
conference following the meeting that the Movement for the 
Republic of Poland (RDR) would decide next Saturday whether to 
join the "triple agreement" of right wing parties made up of the 
ZChN, the Centre Alliance (PC) and the Polish Peasant 
Party-Peasant Agreement (PSL-PL). 
  Chrzanowski said that RDR leader Romuald Szeremietiew was 
already participating in the three parties meetings as an 
"associated person". 
  Ryszard Czarnecki said that the government coalitions budget 
proposals ignored the wishes of the electorate. The coalition 
was not honouring its electoral promises, he maintained. 
Czarnecki added that the failure to increase spending on the 
nations defence was cause for concern given the uncertain 
situation in the East.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 7/1/1994 -- At the press 
conference of 7 January given by Ambassador Traian Chebeleu, 
spokesman for the Presidency of Romania, the following points 
were made about the steps taken by the head of the Romanian 
state for Romania's adherence to NATO: 
  "It is not incidental that the president [Ion Iliescu] paid 
an official visit to NATO in February 1993. Availing himself of 
this opportunity, President Ion Iliescu said before the NATO 
Council: `As a true partner, Romania wishes to work ever closer 
with NATO and to strengthen its ties with the structures of the 
alliance, to draw closer to them, by taking part in any form of 
cooperation open to the Central European countries. Besides the 
immediate positive effects, all this would be of a nature to 
contribute to creating the prerequisites for reaching the 
strategic aim which is Romania's joining the North Atlantic 
Alliance. This would offer the necessary guarantees for a 
normal evolution of the irreversible process of Romania's 
democratization.' 
  "Subsequent to these official efforts made by the president, 
which were among the first statements of this kind on the topic 
of permitting the countries in this part of Europe access to 
NATO, messages were addressed on two different occasions -- in 
September and December 1993 -- to NATO heads of state and NATO 
Secretary General Woerner, including President Iliescu's 
considerations on the role of NATO in maintaining security in 
Central and East Europe, and the official position relative to 
the inclusion in the alliance of the countries in this part of 
Europe. 
  "Those messages were well received by the member states of 
the alliance and found by the greatest part of their 
representatives as most welcome, straightforward, and clearly 
worded," the presidential spokesman said. 
  On receiving the letter from the president of Romania, the 
representatives of several (NATO) states made a point of showing 
that they would support Romania in its strive for integration in 
NATO and other Euro-Atlantic structures, knowing that Romania 
was resolutely committed to the course of democratization and 
the rule of law, and therefore it should stay in the family of 
the democratic European states. 
  It was also shown that Romania's security interests would be 
considered, as well as its readiness to assume responsibilities 
in ensuring security in Europe. 
  A positive assessment was made of the way Romania responded 
to the initiative of Partnership for Peace, which several member 
countries see as a transitional stage in the gradual extension 
process of the alliance. 
  The message of the Romanian president was unanimously 
appreciated as a significant signal for the priority Romania 
gives to enlarging its political, economic, and security 
relations with the Western countries, the spokesman for the 
presidency said.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 6/1/1994 -- During the meeting 
the first deputy foreign minister of the Republic of Moldova, 
Ion Cebuc, had Thursday, 6 January, with Romania's Foreign 
Minister Teodor Melescanu, the two sides examined the means to 
develop the cooperation relations between the two ministries. 
  The sides tackled the bilateral economic relations with an 
emphasis on the fuel deliveries from Romania to Moldova, the 
preparations for the inter-ministerial meeting scheduled for 
mid-January, and the instatement of consultations and 
coordination routines between the relevant ministries and their 
diplomatic missions. The two foreign ministers approached the 
fate of the Ilascu group and their countries' progress in the 
European structures. 
  A meeting took place Thursday, 6 January, at noon, at the 
headquarters of the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
between Ion Cebuc, and Ambassador Marcel Dinu, secretary of 
state at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Romania. 
  Ion Cebuc termed the meeting as fruitful, and said it was 
part of the consultations between the Foreign Ministries of 
Romania and Moldova for the coordination of foreign policy 
actions. 
  The two sides approached economic matters and settled the 
lines of action for the fulfillment of the 20 billion lei credit 
granted by Romania to the Republic of Moldova. Deputy Foreign 
Minister Cebuc said that Moldova refused to participate in the 
Commonwealth of Independent States from the military point of 
view. 
  As for the trial of Tiraspol, Ion Cebuc showed that the 
Republic of Moldova would insist that the trial be held under 
the authority of the constitutional bodies of his country.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES 4/1/1994 -- The executive 
President of the (ruling) Social Democracy Party of Romania 
(PDSR), Adrian Nastase, said that President Ion Iliescu's 
consultations with political leaders were useful for finding the 
best political solutions and formulae as a preliminary phase 
towards a political pact, prior to reaching a ruling pact. 
  Adrian Nastase is of the opinion that the transition to the 
new phase would be possible only when the political parties have 
formed "a certain idea of what a parliamentary majority means." 
The executive president of the PDSR also said at the press 
conference of Tuesday, 4 January, that President Iliescu could 
not possibly draw a new parliamentary map, because the present 
one was the result of the electoral process, but that he could 
endorse subsequent agreements between parties relying on the 
political pact in principle which can forego a possible 
discussion about the formation of a new parliamentary majority, 
and, consequently, of a new government. 
  While reasserting the openness to dialogue with other 
political parties, for a wider parliamentary support, Adrian 
Nastase said that if his party fails to obtain it so, it might 
consider the variant of withdrawing its confidence in the 
government and of switching to the opposition ranks. The 
recourse to early elections is accepted by his party, Mr. Adrian 
Nastase said, only as an ultimate solution, because the chances 
of having the present parliamentary representation proportions 
changed are very low, as a recent IRSOP [Romanian Institute for 
Opinion Polling] poll shows, he said, adding that this choice 
might present the risk that a low voting rate could raise doubts 
as to the legitimacy of the future legislative forum of Romania.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 7 (CTK) -- Representatives of the 
Hungarian ethnic minority are allegedly abandoning their 
original demands before their meeting scheduled to take place in 
the south Slovak city of Komarno tomorrow. 
  Slovak Television reported today that the ethnic Hungarians 
"no longer seek to create a province," and the 100-member 
representative body, which was to have put resolutions of 
tomorrow's meeting into practice, is also unlikely to be 
elected. According to television reports, the reason is the 
Slovak Interior Ministry's refusal to register the 
representative body. 
  Discussion of a self-administrative province stretching 
across southern Slovakia is also being abandoned and proposals 
appear instead providing for the creation of three areas -- the 
Danube, Palocz, and Mezibodrozi regions -- where more than 80 
percent of the almost 600,000-strong Hungarian minority reside. 
  According to the television reports, these concessions may 
be 
linked to the fact that the Komarno Appeal has been opposed not 
only by Slovaks but also by Hungarians and that it has not met 
with favorable response abroad either. 
  However, representatives of the Matica Slovenska (Slovak 
cultural and historical organization) allege that the reason may 
be a tactical temporary lessening of the well-thought out 
demands which will further escalate. It is necessary to wait 
for an answer till tomorrow, the report concluded.

  [Text] Komarno, southern Slovakia, Jan 8 (CTK) -- Today's 
meeting of 3,000 elected representatives of ethnic Hungarians is 
to formulate demands in the sphere of constitutional rights, and 
local and regional self-rule. 
  At the beginning of the meeting Istvan Pasztor, Komarno 
mayor 
and chairman of the Association of Towns and Villages of Zitny 
Ostrov (ZMOZO), which convened the meeting, assured the audience 
that the event was not directed against the territorial 
sovereignty of Slovakia. "As citizens we want to help the 
functioning of the republic," said Pasztor, the main organizer 
of the meeting. Further speeches sharply criticized the methods 
used by Slovak authorities towards the ethnic Hungarian minority 
and the local government. 
  Sandor Rozsa, mayor of Kajal, south Slovakia, called the 
rights of the local government in Slovakia insufficient. The 
relevant articles of the Slovak Constitution are too general, 
making it possible to pass "harmful decisions" contradicting the 
European Charter of Local Government which, in fact, had not 
been accepted by Slovakia, Rozsa said. 
  Stefan Pasztor, mayor of Kralovsky Chlmec, east Slovakia, 
recapitulated the history of the administrative set-up of the 
country since 1918 and suggested that the set-up had always 
disadvantaged the minority. Istvan Zacharias, mayor of Moldava 
nad Bodvou, east Slovakia, rejected the government concept of 
the new administrative set-up of Slovakia and called for 
extended power for the local and regional governments. 
  According to Alzbeta Poganyova, a spokeswoman for 
Egyutteles, 
an ethnic Hungarian party, more than 3,000 persons are attending 
the meeting, out of an expected 5,000 deputies, mayors, and 
representatives of local government. 400 journalists are 
present, she reported. Representatives of the Presidential 
Office and the Government Office as well as diplomats from ten 
embassies were also there, she added. 
  Miklos Duray, chairman of Egyutteles which has, along with 
the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement, 14 deputies in the 
150- member Slovak Parliament, rules out the possibility that 
ethnic tension in south Slovakia could develop into a 
Yugoslav-type conflict. "This does not threaten at all," Duray 
told CTK today. 
  "In Slovakia, no different cultures are opposing one 
another," he said. "In Slovakia, it is more a case of political 
conflict and, basically, an incomplete political structure," he 
added. 
  Duray believes, however, that the Hungarians are 
discriminated against in Slovakia: For example the law on names 
stipulates that a change of a Slovak name into Hungarian 
requires a complicated procedure, while the change of a 
Hungarian name to the Slovak requires a fee of 40 Slovak crowns 
($1.2). 
  According to Duray, peaceful coexistence between Slovaks and 
Hungarians in south Slovakia does not require the direct 
territorial autonomy of the minority, but a self-rule system 
which would take the ethnic character of the population into 
account. "The Hungarians live in Slovakia in a continuous 
territory," he said. Duray stated that while no ethnically 
homogeneous regions exist in Slovakia, Hungarians constitute a 
70-percent majority in the south Slovak region. 
  The Komarno meeting should formulate a demand that the new 
Slovak administrative set-up be suitable for the Hungarian 
minority. This would then be discussed further, Duray said. 
  Duray does not reckon with the election of a 100-member body 
of Hungarian representatives at the meeting, as there is no 
legal substance for this. The conclusions of the Komarno 
meeting should be pushed through in the parliament, in the 
political talks as well as through foreign activities, including 
at the Council of Europe and the European Union, Duray said. 
  According to Duray, the timing of the meeting before the 
upcoming meeting of the Visegrad Four with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton is "pure coincidence," and there is no connection 
between the two events. He considers, nevertheless, the 
solution to the issue of the ethnic Hungarian minority in 
Slovakia to be a precondition for Visegrad cooperation.

  [Text] Komarno, south Slovakia, Jan 8 (CTK) -- In spite of 
the original appeal by the Association of Towns and Villages of 
Zitny Ostrov (ZMOZO), the meeting of Hungarian ethnic minority 
representatives did not elect representatives of Hungarians, 
instead the minority's demands will be pushed for by deputies. 
  The meeting resulted in the adoption of declarations which 
call for solving ethnic problems and establishing relations 
between Slovaks and Hungarians on new principles. "The 
government's previous steps contributed to the worsening of 
mutual relations," the declaration writes. 
  The meeting asked to embody the collective rights of the 
Hungarian minority in the Slovak Constitution. It deemed 
necessary for the development of the Hungarian entity the use of 
the Hungarian language in administrative contact at any place 
where Hungarians make up at least one-tenth of the population. 
Hungarian should become, along with Slovak, the official 
language in locations with a Hungarian majority. The 
representation of Hungarians in state bodies and public 
institutions should be in line with their number. The Hungarian 
entity should be allotted a relevant share of state budget. The 
political existence of the minority should be expressed in the 
election of its own representative bodies. 
  The meeting expressed a claim to the "attribution of special 
legal status for territory with a large number of Hungarians." 
The implementation of ethnic rights in places where they 
constitute a minority should be based on the principle of 
mutuality. 
  Only two meeting participants voted against the 
declarations. 
The crowded arena applauded them because of their courage. The 
meeting also passed an open letter to the Slovak president and 
Slovak citizens, asking them to open a dialogue based on 
equality, and an appeal to Hungarian parents to send their 
children only to Hungarian schools.

  [Text] Komarno, Jan 9 (CTK) -- The leaders of the 
Hungarian minority in Slovakia are convinced that the demands 
formulated at yesterday's meeting here are realizable, "as long 
as the Slovak Government and parliament do not see democracy as 
the dictates the majority," said Miklos Duray, chairman of the 
Egyutteles (Coexistence) Movement, at a press conference after 
the meeting. 
  "We do not want to declare territorial autonomy, but to 
economically develop southern Slovakia," said Istvan Pasztor, 
chairman of the Association of Towns and Villages of Zitny 
Island and mayor of Komarno, on the demands of the Hungarian 
minority. 
  Ethnic Hungarians do not want "anything but to have the same 
rights as are extended to other, purely Slovak regions," said 
Vojtech Bugar, chairman of the Hungarian Christian Democratic 
Movement (MKDH), on the proposal to create new 
territorial-administrative units in southern Slovakia, where 
ethnic Hungarians make up a majority of the population. 
  Duray expressed the conviction that after yesterday's 
meeting, the Slovak Government and Parliament would not act 
against the principles of the European Charter of the Rights of 
Minorities and the Charter of Self-Government. He also said 
that he would strive for the revision of the Benes Decrees, 
under which ethnic Hungarians (as well as the Sudeten Germans) 
were expelled after World War II. 
  Regarding police inspections on the roads to Komarno before 
the meeting, which prevented several participants from 
attending, Bugar said that the Hungarian deputies in the Slovak 
parliament would make an interpellation with the interior 
minister. If it is determined that the minister gave the order 
to the police, or if he refuses to give an answer, Bugar said 
the deputies from Egyutteles and the MKDH would call for his 
removal.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 9 (CTK) -- The confiscation of 
technical documents from buses heading for Komarno, south 
Slovakia, was not conducted under any special command, a 
spokeswoman for local police told Slovak Radio this evening. 
  According to some representatives of the Komarno meeting of 
ethnic Hungarians, the police carried out inspections on the 
roads to Komarno before the meeting, which prevented several 
participants from attending. Hungarian deputies to the Slovak 
Parliament said they would make an interpellation with the 
interior minister. 
  The inspections were made as part of a Slovakia-wide road 
check on Friday and Saturday [7 and 8 January], the spokeswoman 
said. 
  Three buses heading for Komarno were intercepted on 
Saturday, 
she said. Two of them did not have a document confirming 
payment of the road tax, while the third driver had alcohol in 
his bloodstream, she added.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 9 (CTK) -- Local representatives 
and mayors of villages have no authority to hold the kind of 
meeting that took place in Komarno, southern Slovakia, on 
Saturday [8 January], Slovak National Party (SNS) deputy 
Vladimir Miskovsky told Slovak Television this evening. 
  Answers to the call on Slovak constitutional officials by 
the 
meeting of ethnic Hungarian representatives would legitimize the 
demands expressed at the meeting, he said. 
  Miskovsky also said that the issues of two official 
languages 
and ethnic autonomy for the Hungarian minority in Slovakia were 
unacceptable for the SNS.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 10 (CTK) -- The Christian

to be a chief criterion for establishing a new 
territorial-administrative set-up of Slovakia, as suggested by 
the meeting of ethnic Hungarian representatives, KDH Deputy 
Chairman Ivan Simko told CTK today. 
  The KDH does not deem it suitable to consider the use of 
Hungarian as official language in Slovakia, Simko said. It is 
necessary, however, to look for a feasible solution which would 
make it possible to use the mother tongue in administrative 
contact, he added. 
  Simko said that the Komarno, south Slovakia, meeting of 
January 8 had not contributed to straightening up of the 
relations between Slovaks and Hungarians.

  [Excerpt] Bratislava, Jan 4 (CTK) -- Radio Free Europe's 
(RFE) decision to cancel Czech, Hungarian, and Polish 
broadcasts, while preserving Slovak broadcasts, is 
discriminatory towards Slovakia, deputy chairman of the Slovak 
National Party (SNS) Anton Hrnko tells the daily SLOVENSKY 
DENNIK, close to the opposition Christian Democratic Movement 
(KDH). 
  "If the Slovak Government still agreed with dissemination of 
RFE broadcasts, it would actually agree with the correctness of 
the discriminatory decision," Hrnko says. 
  According to Hrnko, freedom of the press in Slovakia is 
comparable to that in the Czech Republic, Poland, or Hungary. "I 
do not think that everything is in order with democracy in 
Slovakia, as we still have a lot of work to become a really 
democratic country. But that sort of democracy we have is also 
in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary," Hrnko says, and 
points to the government's interference in radio and television 
broadcasting in Hungary. 
  Hrnko notes that in the past the RFE was dividing the Slovak 
political scene into the democratic part, whereby the 
pro-Czechoslovak forces were meant, and the undemocratic part, 
whereby the advocates of Slovak sovereignty were meant. "This 
division complicates the real crystallization of the political 
forces. If someone labels the premier's steps as undemocratic, 
he automatically evokes the division into pro-Czechoslovak 
democrats and undemocratic supporters of Slovak independence."

  [Text] Tirana, January 9 (ATA) -- Fifty Albanian young 
fellows from Kosova were forcefully recruited by the Serbian 
Army during 1993. This is a special form of the repression of 
Serbian officials, a report of the Human Rights and Freedoms 
Defence Council in Prishtina said. The data provided by the 
report show that Albanian fellows who were forced to join the 
Serbian Army were born from 1966 to 1974. Most of them were 
arrested in streets or their homes and some of them were brought 
to military court. All Albanian recruits were sent to the 
barracks of the Serbian Army established outside Kosova.

  [Text] Sofia, January 7 (BTA) -- Mass privatization will 
start in mid-1994, Prime Minister Berov says in an analysis 
published in 24 CHASA today. According to the prime minister, 
the number of initiated privatization procedures exceed those 
initially planned, while the concluded deals fall short of those 
envisaged. 
  Over the past year the Agency for Privatization with the 
Council of Ministers initiated 49 privatization procedures and 
concluded 13 deals for sale. The ministries and committees 
authorized to privatize put up for privatization another 293 
smaller units, 49 of which were sold. 
  Stepping into office in the last days of 1992, Prof. Berov's 
cabinet pledged to become the cabinet of privatization. A year 
later the most severe of criticisms are leveled exactly at that 
sphere of the government's activity. 
  In the spring of 1993 the cabinet declared that it was 
adopting a course toward mass socially-oriented privatization 
and in September tabled for discussion at parliament a draft 
amendment to the effective Privatization Act. So far, the draft 
has been shelved by the MP's. "We hope that the draft amendment 
will be put to the vote by the end of this January," Prime 
Minister Berov says in his analysis. The 1994 national budget 
bill, too, has yet to be passed by the same time. 
  Under the government privatization project, all Bulgarian 
nationals above 18 years of age living in this country will 
receive 25,000-leva registered privatization bonds. The Council 
of Ministers is presently drawing up a list of some 500 
enterprises which will be put up for privatization. The list 
will include units of various profitability and financial states 
and will leave out those facing bankruptcy, Prof. Berov says. 
  The World Bank and the IMF have pledged their support for 
the 
project.

  [Text] Sofia, January 10 (BTA) -- A final agreement 
between Bulgaria and the London Club may be expected by the end 
of July if both sides are efficient, Bulgarian Finance Minister 
Stoyan Aleksandrov said today before leaving for Frankfurt for 
the second two-day round of the negotiations between this 
country and the commercial creditor banks of the London Club. 
  The forthcoming round continues the one held last November, 
when the two parties reached an agreement in principle for some 
50 percent reduction of Bulgaria's nearly $12,000 million 
foreign debt to the private creditors of the London Club. Then 
the sides agreed to meet again on January 11 to finalize the 
agreement. 
  The Bulgarian delegation to the negotiations also includes 
Bulgarian Foreign Trade Bank Chief Chavdar Kunchev and Agency 
for Economic Coordination and Development Chief Ventsislav 
Antonov. 
  The agreement in principle envisaged that Bulgaria initially 
pay 5 percent of the interest due for the second, third and 
fourth quarter of 1993. Before the agreement is concluded this 
country should pay $10 million interest rate monthly plus an 
$865 million initial payment. One million U.S. dollar loans 
expected from international financial institutions will help the 
debt settlement. 
  According to Foreign Debt Management Committee member 
Ventsislav Antonov, certain problems are likely to pop out in 
the negotiations. Unless curbed, the steep rise of the U.S. 
dollar may turn out to be a stumbling block. The U.S. currency 
went up by 10 points last week. Other problems may arise if the 
cabinet allows an aggravation of the macroeconomic parameters or 
if the 1994 national budget does not comply with the 
IMF-approved frame work and the stand-by arrangement fails. 
  Bulgaria suspended payments on its foreign debt in March 
1990.

Government of the NATO Member Countries and to the NATO General 
Secretariat" -- ROMPRES headline] 
  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 7/1/1994 -- "Before the high 
level meeting of the NATO countries scheduled for 10 January 
1994, I should like to reassert Romania's position on the 
alliance and reconfirm the constant interest of my country to 
become a full member of the organization. I have expressed this 
interest on various occasions, including in the letter I 
addressed on 18 September 1993 to the NATO General Secretariat, 
to Mr. Manfred Woerner. 
  "Romania considers the North Atlantic Alliance, that has 
proved its ability to adjust to the new realities emerged after 
the close of the Cold War, as being the only organization apt to 
ensure stability on the European continent and guarantee the 
values of democracy and the state of law. 
  "I have received with special interest the `Partnership for 
Peace' proposal, perceived in Romania as being an important 
preliminary stage in the process of the country's full 
integration into the NATO structures. My country has shown 
willing to participate in this new form of cooperation, with 
respect of the requirements imposed by the status of member of 
the alliance. 
  "I would like to use this occasion to reassert Romania's 
strong conviction that, as an European state, it has a rightful 
place into NATO. 
  "In analyzing our request, please take into account 
Romania's 
vital interests of security, that have been given new dimensions 
following the recent political developments in the areas in the 
proximity of my country. 
  "Moreover, Romania is resolute to get more actively involved 
in ensuring stability in the region and in Europe in general, it 
is willing to assume all responsibilities it would have as a 
member of the alliance. 
  "I am sure that Romania's integration into NATO would offer 
us security guarantees absolutely necessary to create conditions 
adequate for translation into practice the democratic 
transformations and the economic reform Romania has firmly 
committed to. 
  "In my outlook, to be a member of NATO is an essential 
constituent of the global process of integration of Romania in 
Euro-Atlantic structures (NATO, WEU [Western European Union], 
the European Union, and the Council of Europe), this is the 
essential objective of the Romanian foreign policy. 
  "I hope that during the debates to be held at the high level 
meeting in Brussels you will consider the position of my 
country, on which all political parties in Romania's Parliament, 
the whole Romanian people, have agreed."

  [Text] The leader of the extraparliamentary Christian 
Democratic Party (Centre) and leader of the unregistered 
Vuzrazhdane [Rebirth] National Socialist Party, the Reverend 
Georgi Gelemenov, demands from the president a public apology on 
national television and sues him for 10,000,000 leva in 
compensatory damages for having been called "a medical case" by 
the president, says a frontpage story in STANDART NEWS. This is 
the first legal action brought against the head of state at the 
Prosecutor General's Office so far. The Rev. Gelemenov can 
produce a medical certificate to prove his sanity. At the end 
of last year, he lashed out at Bulgarian Turks and Gypsies, and 
Dr. Zhelev said in a televised interview on December 29 that his 
statements should long have been referred to the Prosecutor's 
Office. However, the president did not name names in his 
"medical case" allusion, STANDART NEWS recalls. The same daily 
quotes the president's spokesman Valentin Stoyanov as saying 
that it was the Rev. Gelemenov's own business if he identified 
himself with the referent of the president's statement. 
  According to the daily EKSPRES, the National Socialists are 
almost ready with their registration papers, and after they hold 
their constituent meeting scheduled for next week, the legal 
machinery will be put into operation to legitimize their party. 
EKSPRES says that the doctrine of the Rev. Gelemenov's party was 
based on Hitler's economic policy. The daily found out that the 
most active members of the formation included servicemen and 
graduates of the German language schools in Sofia. In case the 
court denied registration to the National Socialist Party, the 
Rev. Gelemenov's people are threatening they will start 
operating underground. 
  The 24 CHASA daily frontpages a report that in Istanbul Adem 
Kenan, leader of the unregistered Turkish Democratic Party, 
denigrated the Bulgarian Constitution and asked for help from 
Turkey. "Sofia is carrying on its assimilatory policy towards 
its citizens of Turkish origin," Mr. Kenan said yesterday, 
quoted by the Bulgarian National Radio and Television. 24 CHASA 
recalls that the prosecutor general ordered a preliminary 
inquiry into the activities of Mr. Kenan's party, which was 
conducted by investigators in Shumen (northeastern Bulgaria). 
The results of the inquiry are expected at the Prosecutor 
General's Office.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 8 (CTK) -- Former Deputy Director of 
the Czechoslovak Intelligence Services Jaroslav Basta said that 
his organization had actively worked against Bill Clinton during 
the 1992 presidential election campaign in the United States, 
according to today's MLADA FRONT DNES. 
  According to Basta, the Czechoslovak intelligence services 
provided incumbent President George Bush's election staff with 
information about Clinton's stay in Prague in 1970 and 
interviewed his acquaintances in Prague looking for information 
to discredit him. 
  A former employee of the Federal Security and Information 
Service (FBIS) [FSIS], who was not named, told the paper that 
the FBIS has worked for George Bush's staff during the election 
campaign. He said that information was to be recorded for 
Bush's staff not only regarding the fact that Clinton had 
visited Moscow shortly after the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia 
by Warsaw Pact troops, but also regarding details about 
Clinton's hosts in Prague. 
  At the end of 1969 and the beginning of 1970, Clinton 
travelled through Scandinavia to Moscow and from there through 
Czechoslovakia to Great Britain, where he was studying at 
Oxford. He stayed in Prague for about six days with the family 
of Jan Kopold, a fellow student at Oxford and grandson of Jan 
Sverma, a pre-World War II communist leader who was killed in 
the Slovak National Uprising against the Nazis at the end of the 
war. 
  Kopold's father Bedrich allegedly worked for one of the 
security sections of the communist regime and his mother Jirina 
was registered as an agent of the Secret Police under the code 
name Jirka, the paper writes. 
  The former FBIS employee said that the intelligence services 
were to hand over the information about Clinton in the fall of 
1992 to members of Bush's campaign staff, who were to come to 
Prague. Another version, however, alleges that the information 
was to appear first in the Czech media and be taken by Bush's 
staff from there. Basta did not rule out the possibility that 
both methods were used. 
  The paper writes that Bush's staff apparently also obtained 
information on Clinton in the Soviet Union and Great Britain. 
  Interior Ministry Spokesman Jan Subrt told MLADA FRONTA DNES 
that Interior Minister Jan Ruml had no comment on the matter, as 
the FBIS had already been an independent organization at the 
time of the alleged activities. 
  Premier Vaclav Klaus's spokeswoman Klara Pospisilova said 
that he had "never heard anything of the sort, so he would not 
comment on it." 
  Petr Cermak, who was federal interior minister at the time, 
said that he did not know anything about the alleged activities. 
"It seems absurd to me. I do not rule out the possibility that 
it could have happened, however," he said.

actively worked against U.S. President Bill Clinton during the 
1992 presidential election campaign in the United States. 
  The statement by Basta and an unnamed FBIS officer was

early Czech communist and later reformer and Charter 77 
signatory Marie Svermova.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 10 (CTK) -- Jaroslav Basta told CTK 
today he stuck by claim that the former Czechoslovak 
counter-intelligence agency had tried to discredit Bill Clinton 
during the 1992 presidential campaign, in which he ran as a 
rival to incumbent President George Bush. 
  Basta, deputy chairman of the Federal Security and 
Information Service (FBIS) [FSIS] in 1990-91, was reacting to a 
statement made today by Stanislav Devaty, current Security and 
Information Service (BIS) director and FBIS deputy director 
until December 1992. In an interview with CTK Devaty dismissed 
allegations that the FBIS had actively worked against Clinton as 
"not based on fact." 
  Basta told CTK he had much evidence to support his claim 
that 
the FBIS wanted to discredit Clinton by publishing information 
about his contacts with the family of Marie Svermova in January 
1970, when he visited Prague as a student. 
  Svermova, who died in 1992, was the widow of Jan Sverma, a 
communist and journalist who died during the anti-Nazi Slovak 
National Uprising in 1944. Svermova, expelled from the 
Communist Party in 1951, was a protagonist of the "Prague 
Spring" reform movement in 1968 and one of the first signatories 
of the Charter 77 human rights statement. 
  Basta recalled an article published by the former daily 
METROPOLITNI TELEGRAF on November 3, 1992, whose author, Lubor 
Kohout, a former agent of the post-November 1989 secret service, 
wrote that Svermova's relatives, who hosted Clinton in Prague in 
1970, collaborated at the end of the 1940s and at the beginning 
of the 1950s with the Czechoslovak secret services. "To retrieve 
this classified data from military counter-intelligence files 
more than 40 years old required expert team work. This could 
not be done by journalists, but exclusively by the 
counter-intelligence," Basta told CTK. 
  He also pointed out Kohout's article carried by the Czech 
right-orientated daily CESKY DENIK today devoted to a member of 
Bush's former campaign staff. The article's authors were 
interested in contacts between his staff and the Czechoslovak 
secret service during the American election campaign. 
  In this connection Basta ruled out the possibility that U.S. 
authorities would have requested the FBIS to provide any 
information. "Americans would never do anything like this," 
Basta stressed.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 10 (CTK) -- Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus, 
reacting to statements by Polish President Lech Walesa in 
today's LIDOVE NOVINY, said he would be a bad Czech politicians 
if he did not place the Czech interests above the joint aims, 
never formulated, of the Visegrad Four. 
  "I am very disappointed," Walesa told the paper. "In 
difficult times, solidarity is necessary," Walesa said. "But 
here, priority is given to some particular interest over common 
aims. In my opinion, (the Czech politicians) are committing a 
mistake which will cost all of us something. If the talks fail, 
we will have to say that the organizers are to be blamed. 
Slovaks, Hungarians, and Poles wanted a joint strategy. I even 
proposed that Vaclav Klaus presented the joint statement on 
behalf of the four countries. But I did not manage," Walesa 
stated. 
  Walesa is right in accusing the Czech Republic of placing 
Czech interests over the joint aims of the Visegrad countries, 
Klaus said, saying he thought that Walesa was also placing 
Poland's interests before the Visegrad Four's. The joint 
interests of the Visegrad Four are a common denominator of the 
four countries' interests, nothing more and nothing less, Klaus 
said. 
  "The offer to present a common position of the four 
countries 
Walesa is talking about was never conveyed to me. As a result, 
I could not have refused it," Klaus stated. 
  Klaus added that the Czech Republic had neither organized 
nor 
initiated the talks of U.S. President Bill Clinton with Visegrad 
Four representatives. The Czech Republic "only" gladly accepted 
the American initiative and welcomed the idea of holding the 
talks in Prague. Klaus said he could not see any reason why the 
talks should fail.

  [Text] Prague, January 7 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic 
understands the Partnership for Peace project as the maximum 
which, given the present world situation, Western partners are 
prepared to offer Central and Eastern European countries, but 
also as a minimum for ensuring the security needs of the Czech 
Republic, Deputy Defense Minister Jiri Pospisil said on his 
return from Warsaw today. 
  This was the opinion which Pospisil presented in Warsaw at a 
meeting of Visegrad Group (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, 
and Hungary) defense ministers, and at a meeting of all the 
delegations with U.S. Army Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman John 
Shalikashvili and American Ambassador to the United Nations 
Madeleine Albright who flew to Warsaw today. 
  Shalikashvili agreed with this description of Partnership 
for 
Peace and said it was up to concrete talks between experts to 
make a maximum out of the minimum, Pospisil reported. 
  The Czech Republic is one of the countries which is prepared 
to make use of the fact that the American initiative is called 
partnership, and wants therefore to influence the conditions of 
the partnership, Pospisil said. He added that the Czechs could 
develop a lot of initiatives within the framework of the 
partnership for peace, but might have problems with fulfilling 
them in a qualified way. 
  It was better at present to develop specific cooperation and 
become integrated into European structures. Later, attempts 
could be made at informal but recognized guarantees that "no-one 
will try to attack us." The Czech Republic was neither willing 
nor capable of believing formal guarantees, Pospisil said. 
  "It is better for the Czech Republic to have multilateral 
relations with the rest of Europe and with the working security 
structure of Europe, which is NATO," Pospisil said. 
  Pospisil said he understood Poland's standpoint, presented 
by 
Polish President Lech Walesa, who appealed to Visegrad Four 
defense ministers today to work out a united strategy for their 
countries to join NATO. 
  In Warsaw Pospisil said several times that the Czech 
Republic 
did not want "to be the only country to join NATO and that it 
wanted neither exclude nor isolate anyone." The Czech Republic 
was ready to join NATO jointly (if this was more effective), but 
it would join the alliance by itself if this proved a more 
advantageous and quicker way, he added. 
  The Czech Republic would not consider it had failed if some 
other Visegrad country were accepted to NATO before it. It 
would be an opportunity for the Czech Republic to learn how to 
achieve the same goal, Pospisil said. 
  He said the reason for the Polish standpoint was that Poland 
had a common border with Russia and any sort of surprises could 
be expected from the countries to the east of the Visegrad 
Group. "That is why the Czech Republic understands Poland's 
nervousness and did not distance itself from its position," 
Pospisil said.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 10 (CTK) -- The security of the Czech 
Republic and that of the Central European region is directly 
linked to the security of the United States, U.S. Ambassador to 
the U.N. Madeleine Albright told Klaus today. 
  During a meeting between Albright, head of U.S. Armed Forces 
John Shalikashvili, and Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus, the three 
participants held similar views on the "Partnership for Peace" 
project. 
  To the countries of the Central European region, it presents 
an open opportunity for establishing close military and 
political ties with NATO, according to the statement issued by 
the Premier's Office. The project is also a tool, according to 
Klaus, for strengthening the internal stability of the Central 
European region. 
  U.S. presence in Europe is important for democratic 
development and stability of the whole of Europe, Klaus said at 
the meeting, adding that the Czech Republic is interested in its 
neighbors' success and prosperity. The Czech Republic prefers 
concrete accords like the Central European Free Trade Agreement 
to summits and joint declarations, Klaus said.

  [Excerpt] Prague, Jan 10 (CTK) -- It will not be long 
before the Czech Republic becomes a NATO member state, Czech 
Defense Minister Antonin Baudys told journalists today after his 
meeting with U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Madeleine Albright and 
head of U.S. Armed Forces John Shalikashvili. 
  The U.S. project Partnership for Peace has been formulated 
in 
such a way, Baudys said, as to offer an almost unbelievably wide 
choice from "zero cooperation to the closest possible 
cooperation," allowing bilateral adaptation between the Czech 
and NATO armed forces. 
  "Under the project, we want to achieve a maximum number of 
concrete military steps," Baudys said, adding that he believed 
this would make "all NATO members see that the Czech Republic is 
capable of accepting its share of responsibility for the 
European security." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Prague, January 10 (CTK) -- The United States 
would welcome a common standpoint from the Visegrad countries 
(the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, and Hungary) on the 
Brussels NATO summit, U.S. Ambassador to the UN Madeleine 
Albright said today after meeting Czech Foreign Minister Josef 
Zieleniec. Also present was John Shalikashvili, chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff of the U.S. Armed Forces. [passage omitted] 
  Albright and Shalikashvili informed Czech representatives on 
the political principles and individual aspects of the U.S. 
Partnership for Peace initiative, Czech Foreign Minister Josef 
Zieleniec said after a meeting with them today. 
  He stressed that the Czech Republic considered Partnership 
for Peace as a project which could bring new impulses to the 
creation of European security framework. The Czech Republic 
intends to show its partners that it is not striving just to 
acquire unilateral security guarantees, but that it is able to 
assume the relevant share of responsibility, Zieleniec said. 
  Zieleniec called the American initiative an important step 
which opened up the way for the Czech Republic to NATO. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Prague, Jan 10 (CTK) -- The Partnership for Peace 
project covers the transitional period until the Czechs have 
built sufficient support for the idea of "solidarity with 
Western European states and a similar feeling on their part 
towards us," Jiri Payne, chairman of the Foreign Committee of 
the Czech Parliament and member of the Civic Democratic Party 
(ODS), said today. 
  He spoke after today's meeting between members of the 
committee, those of the Defense and Security Committee, member 
of the U.S. Government and U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Madeleine 
Albright, and head of the U.S. Armed Forces John Shalikashvili. 
  Partnership for Peace is an answer to the Central European 
states' demands for NATO membership, Payne said, adding, "this 
is the first time people have given serious consideration to the 
issue and come up with a certain approach to it." We have 
succeeded in breaking through a barrier, he said, quoting 
Shalikashvili's remark that three months ago something like that 
would have been impossible. The project has been conceived so 
that each state could set its own pace of integration into 
security structures, Payne said. 
  The project includes the evaluation of individual countries' 
political conditions, namely progress on respect for democratic 
political system and frontiers, civil and human rights, budget 
transparency and civilian control of the military, Defense and 
Security Committee Chairman Vladimir Suman said. 
  It will also include concrete aspect of military 
cooperation, 
such as army maneuvers and the sending of Czech representatives 
to NATO's political and military organs, Suman added.

  [Text] Prague Jan 6 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic's 
undisputable economic success and social peace, which testify to 
the government's flexible social policy, were the major 
positives of the last year, Josef Lux, agriculture minister and 
chairman of the government coalition Christian Democratic 
Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL), said today. 
  The current social tranquility in the Czech Republic 
testifies also to the people's willingness to accept the road 
that had been embarked on, along with the problems which 
accompany it, Lux told journalists. He added that it was of key 
importance that social peace be preserved this year as well. 
Lux said that while implementing the principles of a market 
economy, the government had actually managed to establish the 
principle of a social market economy -- social consideration. 
  He said he firmly believed that in the process of the 
general 
denationalisation of state-owned enterprises, trade unions 
should play an active role as a mediator between employers and 
employees and that the KDU-CSL intended to support them. 
  As regards the envisaged five-percent unemployment, the 
KDU-CSL considered it necessary and acceptable, said Lux, adding 
that he considered the number of employed to be less important 
than the period of time during which people have no jobs. He 
pointed to the necessity of a more active implementation of 
regional policy in problematic regions and especially in areas 
with high unemployment.

  [Text] Brno, South Moravia Jan 7 (CTK) -- Moravian 
National Party (MNS) Chairman Ivan Drimal today said that it 
would be impossible to arrive at a rational, functioning 
territorial-administrative set-up in the Czech Republic if the 
restoration of Moravia's historical lands was ignored. 
  He said that the realisation of Moravia-wide projects in all 
spheres, and consequently the corresponding living standard of 
Moravia's citizens, would depend on the position of Moravia 
within the Czech Republic. A government bill on the creation of 
higher territorial and administrative units ignores this 
reality, Drimal said. "It is merely a postponing maneuver and 
an attempt at a factual strengthening of centralism," he said. 
  "By its attempt to leave the issue of Moravia's territorial 
integrity out of problems concerning the Czech Republic's future 
set-up, the government actually helps create the source of 
internal instability," Drimal said. 
  The far-right nationalist MNS disagrees with the idea of 
linking the 1994 local elections to other elections, which would 
result in voter disorientation, said the MNS chairman. 
  Regarding Czech President Vaclav Havel's New Year's speech, 
he said it was "not very specific and practically ignored the 
most pressing problems in our society at present." On the other 
hand, he said, Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus was pretty specific in 
his television appearance on January 2 and confirmed his 
uncompromising centralist attitudes towards all fundamental 
issues of the Czech Republic's management and internal 
structure, Drimal said. 
  "Under Premier Klaus's leadership the Czech Republic is 
becoming a bastion of rigid centralism, which is an anachronism 
in the rest of Europe, and this is rather disquieting for the 
future of our democratically-developing state," Drimal said.

  [Text] Prague Jan 6 (CTK) -- "We are convinced that the 
International Court at The Hague will reverse the Czech 
Constitutional Court decision validating the law on 
anti-communist resistance and the illegality of the communist 
regime," a leading legal expert of the Communist Party of 
Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM) told journalists today. KSCM experts 
consider the law to be in violation of the Czech Constitution, 
Vojtech Filip said. 
  The law is based on the idea of collective responsibility 
and 
collective guilt, he said, adding that it violates a ban on 
discrimination incorporated into a number of international 
standards recognised by the Czech Republic. 
  The law also allows the punishment of deeds considered legal 
under the former regime and those which would otherwise be no 
longer punishable, Filip said, adding he believed there would be 
no new stage trials. Should it come to that, the KSCM will 
provide the accused with legal aid irrespective of their 
political affiliation, religion or race.

  [Text] Warsaw, January 10 (MTI) -- Poland, Hungary and 
Slovakia seek to maintain the Visegrad Group cooperation, and 
"sooner or later, the Czechs will also realize there is no 
shorter way to Europe or NATO. These countries can become 
members of European institutions more or less simultaneously," 
Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky told Poland's 
authoritative weekly POLITYKA. 
  In Jeszenszky's view, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic 
and 
Slovakia are linked by historical, cultural and economic ties. 
He asserts that the four countries, problems and the mentality 
of their residents are very similar. He added that the United 
States, the European Union and other European institutions are 
also for maintaining the Visegrad Group, and treating the four 
countries as a group of states. 
  The Prague meeting, Jeszenszky said, is a good opportunity 
for the U.S. President to see the importance of this part of 
Europe. "It would be good for the President to realize how many 
dangers our new democracies have to face. America has to accept 
a certain responsibility for their fate," he said. 
  He stressed that the membership of the region's countries in 
European structures may be the first stage in the eastward 
expansion of democracy, welfare and stability. "A stable 
Central Europe can be an example and hope for other states in 
the region that it is worth taking the same path of economic and 
political reform... Towards a full membership in the European 
Union and in NATO."

<F P=106> [News conference by U.S. President Bill Clinton and Czech </F>
President Vaclav Havel with an unidentified moderator at Prague 
Castle -- live] 
  [Text] [Moderator] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. 
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Czech President Vaclav Havel 
have just finished their talks, which lasted 45 minutes. They 
are prepared to make short statements and after that they will 
answer two questions. I would like to ask President Havel to 
make his statement. 
  [Havel] I would like to say that the Czech Republic is 
extremely honored by the visit of the U.S. President as well as 
by the fact that Prague was chosen as the location of the 
meeting with the representatives of neighboring countries. 
  During the talks we had either as delegations or 
individually, we made it clear that the Czech Republic welcomes 
the Partnership for Peace project and is ready to immediately 
start giving this project a concrete content. The Czech 
Republic considers this project to be well-balanced and good. 
  At the same time, we expressed our will to cooperate with 
our 
neighbors. We noted the similarity of our stances with our 
neighbors, and we stressed that we also attach great importance 
to regional cooperation. 
  We discussed several other topics, including economic 
cooperation. On behalf of the Czech side this is all for the 
time being. 
  [Clinton, in English with simultaneous Czech translation] 
First I want to express my thanks to President Havel for his 
warm welcome. I am paying only my second visit to Prague. I 
was here 24 years ago in the same week but in a totally 
different role. The progress that Prague and the Czech Republic 
have made has made a great impression on me. Likewise, my 
conversions and meetings with your president, prime minister, 
and other representatives have also made a great impression on 
me. 
  I confirmed that the security of this republic and other 
members of Central and Eastern Europe is very significant for 
the security of the United States and European countries as well 
as of the Atlantic alliance. The Partnership for Peace is the 
beginning of a genuine security relationship which could lead to 
full membership in NATO. 
  Of course, we must also think about the economic dimension 
of 
security. Without this, it would be difficult to achieve good 
policy and develop genuinely democratic relations in the name of 
the success of nations in all Partnership countries and the 
development of society. We have been talking about these 
things; further talks await us tomorrow, when we will talk, 
perhaps in more specific terms, about how to attain these aims. 
In any case, I thank President Havel for his support for 
Partnership for Peace. 
  [Moderator] Your questions, please. Czech Television, [name 
indistinct]. 
  [Question] I am [name indistinct] from Czech Television. 
Gentlemen, do you think any East European country could join 
NATO ahead of the rest? 
  [Havel] We interpret Partnership for Peace as a door open to 
all, but, of course, a lot will depend on each individual just 
how soon he passes through that door. This projects wants to 
deal with each country individually. 
  [Clinton] This issue has not been resolved. [Passage 
indistinct] As regards Partnership for Peace, one has to 
emphasize that with immediate effect it will provide for joint 
exercises, joint preparation of the armed forces, and joint 
solutions to a number of issues which could lead to full 
membership. 
  [Moderator] [Word indistinct], please. 
  [Question] [passage indistinct] 
  [Interpreter] Apologies from the interpreter. I can't hear 
the question. 
  [Havel] Developments in the Russian Federation have been 
complex, dramatic, and painful and we are naturally following 
them most attentively. But we firmly believe that in the 
Russian Federation too, democracy and the market economy will 
gradually prevail, despite all the complex stages and episodes 
of this development. 
  [Moderator] The presidents have a further program ahead of 
them. Thank you for your questions and your attention. Good 
bye.

  [Text] I still have not dispelled all my doubts concerning 
the conviction that the Partnership for Peace leads to NATO 
membership, Andrzej Olechowski, head of the Polish diplomatic 
delegation, has said in Prague. In Olechowski's view, all the 
decisions made at the Brussels' summit were, after all, 
beneficial for Poland. In his opinion the Partnership for Peace 
raises the security level in such a sense that it brings us 
closer to NATO. Among other things, we will have access to the 
procedures and military technology of the pact. In time, we 
gradually will be getting access to early warning systems and 
the exchange of intelligence available to the pact, Olechowski 
said. 
  However, because of the fact that no timetable was defined 
for Poland joining western structures, Olechowski said that he 
considered it to be a Polish failure connected with the NATO 
summit in Brussels.

  [Text] Our correspondent Eva Hulkova brings topical 
information about the proceedings at Prague Castle. 
  [Hulkova] Intensive working meetings are under way at Prague 
Castle. At the moment President Vaclav Havel is in talks with 
Hungarian President Arpad Goncz. President Havel has already had 
talks with [Slovak President] Michal Kovac and [Polish 
President] Lech Walesa. The foreign ministers' talks were being 
held at the same time. Of course, the Partnership for Peace is 
the center of attention. 
  Responding to the question by Czech Radio as to whether any 
issues remain open, Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec said 
that there are a number of open issues since the Partnership for 
Peace is a program that, by its nature, is an open one. I hope 
that this is the space that we will fill in by our activity and 
that this activity -- not only ours but also the activity of the 
16 NATO countries -- will result in our soon becoming a 
component part of NATO that brings together countries with whom 
we are close by our civilization, history, and values, said the 
Czech foreign minister for Czech Radio. 
  [Polish Foreign Minister] Andrzej Olechowski said that the 
Polish side considered the Partnership for Peace to be a very 
important contribution to European security, and that he 
perceived the project as innovative, constructive, and 
optimistic.

  [Text] Bilateral talks between Visegrad Four prime 
ministers continue in Hrzan Palace in Prague. Our editor Jana 
Zemanova is at Hrzan Palace. 
  [Zemanova] The meeting behind closed doors between the Czech 
and Slovak Prime Ministers Vaclav Klaus and Vladimir Meciar is 
drawing to an end in Hrzan Palace. It is a part of today's 
series of bilateral talks on security and further cooperation 
between Visegrad countries at prime ministerial level. 
  During the previous meeting between Czech Prime Minister 
Klaus and his Polish counterpart Waldemar Pawlak, the two 
politicians explained to each other a certain tension which was 
generated by Prague's individualist attitude to the acceptance 
of the U.S. Partnership for Peace plan. This is how Klaus 
described this situation: 
  [Begin Klaus recording] I think that relations are not as 
tense as it would appear from some media headlines. We have a 
whole number of projects we would like to execute together. 
These projects should be directed at practical forms of 
Czech-Polish contacts and cooperation. I think that our views 
on this point were completely identical. [end recording] 
  [Zemanova] What is important is that the two prime ministers 
jointly emphasized the willingness to continue to cooperate and 
to meet for further talks as soon as possible. According to 
Pawlak, economic cooperation will have priority in future 
relations between the Czech Republic and Poland. After all, 
this can be documented by the presence at the talks of Czech 
Economics Minister Karel Dyba.

  [Excerpts] Let us go back to Prague Castle once again. 
Czech radio correspondent Eva Hulkova has recorded several 
statements there. [passage omitted] 
  The next speaker to come to the Czech radio microphone was 
Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski. 
  [Begin Olechowski recording, in English fading into Czech 
translation] What we are saying is that we regard the 
Partnership for Peace as a very important contribution to 
European security. We think it is an innovative, constructive, 
and optimistic program. As we have often been saying, our 
problem with this program is that, although it is a step in the 
right direction, it is a very small step, because this program 
does not provide a clear prospect for our NATO membership. We 
have noticed, unfortunately, that in all the Western 
institutions in which we are seeking membership, there are 
various stages of preparation for our membership. No promise 
has been given to us that we will actually get this membership. 
This is where the essence of Polish criticism lies. [end 
recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bill Clinton's series of talks with the Visegrad 
country presidents and prime ministers has begun in Prague. 
First the U.S. President met the Hungarian leaders. Our Prague 
correspondent Peter Nyaradi reports. 
  [Nyaradi] The Hungarian delegation arrived at the Prague 
residence of the U.S. ambassador, where the Hungarian-U.S. 
summit meeting took place, shortly before 0900. Beside 
President Clinton sat [Hungarian President] Arpad Goncz. The 
negotiating delegations, led by [Prime Minister] Peter Boross 
and [Foreign Minister] Geza Jeszenszky , U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher, and [John] Shalikashvili, U.S. chief of 
staff, were seated opposite one another. 
  Following the talks, which lasted nearly 45 minutes, Foreign 
Affairs Spokesman Janos Herman evaluated the meeting as follows: 
  [Begin Herman recording] Due to the venue and the time, the 
central topic of the discussion, naturally, was the region's 
security policy situation. President Clinton confirmed that the 
United States followed our region with great attention, and the 
security of the region was both in the United States and NATO's 
interest. It is an important interest of the United States to 
guarantee this security. 
  The Partnership for Peace proposal was mentioned. The 
Hungarian delegation told President Clinton that Hungary 
welcomed this proposal; it can see the advantages of the idea. 
Hungary is ready to actively participate in the Partnership for 
Peace process. 
  President Clinton praised the Hungarian attitude. He 
stressed he felt Hungary had understood U.S. intentions, the 
essence of the initiative. [end recording] 
  [Nyaradi] Janos Herman also said that mostly President 
Clinton had spoken during the discussion, more than half of 
which was devoted to security policy issues. It was also 
mentioned that the United States was ready to help the region's 
-- and within that Hungary's -- economic development, and they 
were ready to examine what they could do about it. 
  The two delegations also discussed the events of the 
Yugoslav 
crisis. In the course of this discussion, the Hungarian 
delegation was able to provide valuable information, since we 
are a neighboring country. 
  The Russian domestic political situation and its possible 
international effects were also briefly raised. President 
Clinton emphasized that the United States was not naive and will 
not allow itself to be pressurized either, but the Russian's 
views had to be considered. 
  At the end of the talks, which took place in friendly 
atmosphere, Hungary was also on the agenda. Janos Herman said 
the following about it: 
  [Begin Herman recording] The U.S. side stressed that the 
stability of democracy in Hungary was highly appreciated by 
them. The smooth and quick election of the new prime minister 
was considered as a proof of this. [end recording] 
  [Nyaradi] The Hungarian delegation has split for the rest of 
their program. Arpad Goncz and Geza Jeszenszky held 
approximately 30-minute talks with their Czech counterparts 
President Vaclav Havel and Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec in 
Prague Castle. During this time, Prime Minister Peter Boross 
first visited the financial institution Interbanka, which has 
gone into majority Hungarian ownership, at Wenceslas Square, 
then he met his Czech counterpart Vaclav Klaus. 
  At the moment, all the foreign guests are having lunch with 
U.S. President Clinton and the members of the U.S. delegation at 
the ambassador's residency. Brief statements can be expected 
after the ceremonial lunch.

  [Text] Wladyslaw Klaczynski, director of the Press and 
Information Department in the Foreign Affairs Ministry, speaks 
on the meeting between President Lech Walesa and Bill Clinton: 
  [Begin Klaczynski recording] The meeting between the two 
presidents took place in a very matter-of-fact and calm 
[spokojna] atmosphere. President Walesa said that Poland did 
not intend to block the [Partnership for Peace] initiative, but 
he pointed out all the doubts connected with it, the doubts 
arising from the historical experience of our country, and the 
doubts arising from the assessment of the situation. 
  Anyway, President Walesa emphasized the wish, if not to say 
a 
determined wish, for the process of our country's integration 
with European structures, involving equally the areas of 
security, politics, and economics, to take place efficiently and 
as speedily as possible. He emphasized that this aspiration is 
not aimed at cutting Russia off and that this aspiration was not 
aimed against Russia and Russia's interests. 
  Another important element was a statement by Prime Minister 
Pawlak who spoke about economic relations between Poland and 
Europe, and between Poland and the United States. 
  President Walesa emphasized on many occasions the need for 
more activity on the part of Western Europe in the integration 
processes. I would like to stress here what President Clinton 
pointed out a few times. He said that he regarded the 
Partnership for Peace as an opening of the door and not the 
creation of obstacles. [end recording]

  [Text] NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner replied to 
the letter he received from Irfan Ljubijankic, foreign minister 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina, on 23 December 1993 concerning our 
initiative for Bosnia-Herzegovina's participation in the 
Partnership for Peace. The letter stresses that 
Bosnia-Herzegovina's application will be considered and that all 
NATO members have been informed about this initiative. 
  Partnership for Peace does not represent formal membership 
in 
NATO. It implies mutual obligations of NATO member states and 
those countries whose foreign and defense policies have the same 
aims as those of NATO member states. This idea was initiated by 
U.S. President Bill Clinton and, in the initial stage, it 
referred to some Central European countries that have already 
met the conditions for participation in Partnership for Peace. 
In his letter to Ljubijankic, Woerner expressed the belief that 
this year will bring peace to Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  This was stated in a communique issued by the Foreign 
Ministry of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item -- by Stevan Cordas] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, January 11 (TANJUG) -- The failure of the 
French-British proposal presented at the NATO summit in Brussels 
for threatening the Bosnian Serbs with air strikes if they 
refuse to allow the use of the Tuzla airport and lift the 
blockade of the Moslem enclave of Srebrenica was a logical and 
expected outcome of the meeting, diplomatic sources in Belgrade 
assessed in first unofficial reactions on Tuesday. 
  This opinion is based on NATO's old stand that only a 
political solution is possible in the former Yugoslav Republic 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as it was again stressed at the two-day 
summit. 
  This is precisely why NATO is using threats and pressure to 
stimulate the three warring sides in Bosnia to lay down arms and 
find political solutions to their conflicts. 
  The harsh threats made by NATO officials prior to the 
Brussels summit were calculated to step up pressure in 
expectation of a new round of peace talks on Bosnia, due to open 
in Geneva on January 18, and before the talks between Croatian 
President Franjo Tudjman and Bosnian Moslem leader Alija 
Izetbegovic in Bonn last Sunday and Monday, the sources said. 
  The strongest threats were again addressed to the Bosnian 
Serb side while the Croats were threatened with sanctions and 
the Moslems with a withdrawal of the United Nations peacekeepers 
from Bosnia. 
  The Brussels summit has shown that the Bosnian conflict is 
indeed giving NATO a headache but that it is by no means its 
main preoccupation. 
  No doubt, the organization finds the questions of Russia, 
NATO's survival and other issues relating to its operation more 
vital than the problem of Bosnia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman by Beate </F>
Mueller-Blattau in Bonn; date not given; questions are in 
English; Tudjman answers in Serbo-Croatian, with superimposed 
translation into German -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Mueller-Blattau] Mr. President, the result of the 
peace negotiations is very unsatisfactory. Why was there no 
better outcome? 
  [Tudjman] One could agree with your assessment that the 
result is unsatisfactory and one could also assume that the 
Croatian delegation is not satisfied with the results. But I 
think that the meeting was in a certain sense a success because 
it helped clarify many important questions, and in any case it 
is important for people to know that Croatian policy is 
consistent, not only with regard to an end to hostilities but 
also with regard to all efforts at cooperation and friendship 
between Muslims and Croats. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] Mr. President, with all due respect, the 
whole world is hoping for peace because we all assume there will 
soon be no more money and no more arms left. Where are you 
getting the weapons? 
  [Tudjman] The Muslim side has of course some weapons and 
munitions factories, and one has to say that they have gained a 
certain advantage by having used humanitarian convoys in order 
to import high-tech war material. In all wars in the world, 
there are always some opportunities to gain access to weapons. 
Over and above this, the Serb side is selling arms at very high 
prices to every party involved in the war. And they have quite 
certainly considerable quantities. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] Mr. President, you could probably call me 
very naive if I ask why the Bosnians and the Croats don't join 
forces and fight together against the main aggressor, the Serbs. 
  [Tudjman] At the beginning, the Croats and the Muslims not 
only made common cause, but the Croats in Bosnia and in 
Herzegovina defended Bosnia-Herzegovina against the Serb 
aggressor with the aid of the Republic of Croatia, at a time 
when the Muslims were not able to do this. If that had not been 
the case, then the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina would have fallen 
into the hands of the Serb aggressor. Later, however, the 
understanding between the Croats and Muslims broke down because 
at that time, the Serbs had conquered two-thirds of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Muslims, knowing that they could not 
retake the country, turned against the Croats. That is the set 
of problems. Even the talks yesterday and the day before were 
concerned with this particular set of problems. And that is 
probably why no agreement was reached -- to be precise, 
particularly because there is the Muslim demand that they should 
take over the regions inhabited by Croats. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] There is a rumor, Mr. President, that you 
met Milosevic even before the war, in 1991, to talk even then 
about the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Is that correct, Mr. 
President? 
  [Tudjman] Yes, that's right. I did actually meet Mr. 
Milosevic. Following the meeting, I also suggested that 
Milosevic and I should meet Izetbegovic as well, for these are 
the three most important people in relation to the fate of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. We met in Split. The main topic was at 
that time the prevention of a possible war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. And in Split we held the same views and 
positions which we put forward right at the start on the 
Petersberg.

  [Text] A two-day meeting between state delegations of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia ended in Bonn today. In this 
connection, Alija Izetbegovic, president of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, made the following statement for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio and television: 
  [Begin Izetbegovic recording] I am on the line from Bonn, 
where talks between us and the Croatian delegation ended an hour 
ago. I must say that the talks were organized by the German 
Government and that they took place with the help from German 
Foreign Minister Mr. Kinkel and Cochairmen Owen and Stoltenberg. 
These talks took place last night and they lasted for several 
hours until midnight last night, because we arrived late 
yesterday afternoon, and all day today. They lasted for more 
than 10 hours with interruptions. 
  Nothing special has been achieved. We did not expect much 
from these talks anyhow. As far as we are concerned, we drew 
their attention to three important issues: the situation in 
central Bosnia, Mostar, and access to the sea. 
  Regarding central Bosnia, we took the line that military 
disengagement ought to be carried out by the Croatian Defense 
Council [HVO] withdrawing from Vitez and Busovaca. In return, 
our army would not enter these towns; they would be entered by a 
mixed police force. However, the Croatian side unfortunately 
rejected this proposal. 
  Regarding Mostar, we insisted on a solution that has already 
been put forward, that Mostar be administered by the European 
Union for two years after the agreement is signed. In that 
period, the main job for the European Union would be to return 
home all Mostar citizens. This period would be under the slogan 
"Mostar to the Citizens of Mostar"; that is, all citizens of 
Mostar who have been evicted would return. Their number is huge 
-- tens of thousands of people have been evicted, several 
thousand families have been evicted from Mostar. They would 
return. Now they are scattered; some are in Croatia, some in 
Bosnia, and a huge majority of them are now in Germany and in 
Nordic countries. Our aim is that these people should return to 
Mostar. I would like to stress that we cannot accept any 
definition which says that Mostar is only a Croat town. We 
cannot accept it. Mostar is a Muslim town. It is a common 
town. We will insist on that. 
  Regarding access to the sea, there has been no progress. The 
Croatian side is toughest here. Now they have come up with a 
new proposal: to cede for 50 or more years a part of the coast 
at the Peljesac peninsula. This actually means leasing it for 
50 or more years. This refers to a part of the coast on which 
we could build up a port. We took that proposal into 
consideration, but of course we did not give any answer. 
  We also initiated another series of current questions, 
primarily the release of all prisoners. According to our 
information, we are talking about another several thousand of 
our people. The Croatian side claims the figure is not as high, 
but it is not denying that a certain number of our prisoners -- 
which it has promised to release soon -- are still in prisons, 
like those at Heliodrom near Mostar, Dretelj, and Ljubusko. 
  We also insisted on having a hospital sent to us, a large 
field hospital in the east side of Mostar, which is currently in 
the port Ploce and has been there for a long time. It was said 
that this issue has been resolved and that it is now up to the 
UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] to transport the hospital, and 
that there are no further obstacles. [sentence as heard] 
  The helicopters are unfortunately still in [Croat-held] 
Medjugorje, I mean our two helicopters which arrived there to 
pick up the wounded. According to the Croatian side, the 
problem there is that we have not released 71 Croat prisoners 
who were on the list. We will have to examine this issue again. 
  I must say that the Croat delegation surprised us with one 
of 
their proposals. We were taken by surprise by it. It is a 
draft agreement on comprehensive cooperation between 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. They are offering a creation 
sometime in the future of a common market, a customs union, and 
even a monetary union between the two states. They also 
proposed that we have free access to the sea, that there should 
practically be no borders between the two states, and so forth. 
  This is an interesting proposal which, I must say, was made 
at an inopportune time. Of course, we did not reject such a 
proposal. We did not accept it either. We did not have the 
mandate to discuss it. I told them this, but said that we will 
examine the proposal seriously, to see all its implications on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, to see what it contains, and what the 
political, economic, and other consequences would be. Among 
other things, the creation of a so-called common market was 
envisaged. This was an interesting proposal that took us a bit 
by surprise. 
  I must emphasize that these talks were talks between the two 
state delegations. In our state delegation I had with me 
Foreign Minister Ljubijankic and Mr. Komsic. On their side, 
apart from Tudjman and Dr. Granic, their deputy prime minister 
and foreign minister were representatives of the Bosnian Croats. 
  This was, in the main, the outcome of the talks which ended 
this evening. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with reporter Volker Wagner in Bonn by </F>
Karin Beindorf in Cologne -- live] 
  [Text] [Beindorf] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and 
his Foreign Minister Mate Granic gave a news conference at the 
Croatian embassy in Bonn two hours ago. Mr. Wagner, Tudjman 
described the Petersberg talks as useful yesterday. Has it 
become clear what he meant by that? 
  [Wagner] No. One cannot really say that things have become 
clearer. Quite the contrary. This news conference has 
confirmed an old truth -- that the more interesting pieces of 
news become usually known before, after, or on the sidelines of 
news conferences. One such news item that has leaked from the 
surroundings of the delegation is that the 16-page confederation 
document with 16 articles, presented by President Tudjman, was 
primarily a tactical paper, a tactical paper designed to tell 
the world: Look, the Muslims are not pursuing any consistent 
policy at all in Bosnia. They are simply interested in 
conquering territory in central Bosnia at the expense of the 
Croats. Look, we Croats are developing ideas about the 
political future, as to how Muslims and Croats might live 
together in the near future. Yet this was a tactical move. 
  At the same time, however, Tudjman is serious about the 
confederation proposal, even though the chances of its 
implementation may lie in the distant future. Generally, 
Tudjman repeated what he declared yesterday evening. He 
expressed moderate satisfaction, but made very vague statements. 
Thus, all kinds if interpretation are possible. 
  [Beindorf] What controversial issues were discussed? What 
about Mostar or access to the Adriatic Sea for the Muslims? 
  [Wagner] It was difficult to find that out. The following 
became known: Croatia wants to keep Mostar, Tudjman stated. 
The reason he gave was that Mostar is the only large town that 
the Bosnian Croats control in Bosnia -- even though not entirely 
at the moment. The Muslims, however, largely control Sarajevo, 
Senica, and Tuzla. The Croats need Mostar as an administrative 
center for the state of Herceg-Bosnia that they proclaimed 
unilaterally. 
  Tudjman also stressed that the proportional representation 
of 
the ethnic groups has changed at the expense of the Croatians 
since the beginning of the war. It is very difficult to verify 
that at the moment because, as we know, tens of thousands of 
Muslims are living in a kind of ghetto in the eastern part of 
the town at present. Nobody knows exactly how many there are. 
The only thing that is certain is that the number of Muslims 
and Croats was about the same in this town before the war. 
  As far as access to the Adriatic Sea is concerned, Tudjman 
made it clear that Neum, the 10-km-wide strip that belonged to 
Bosnia in the old Yugoslavia, will be taboo for the Bosnian 
Muslims. It should only be used touristically. Thus, the old 
proposal continues to be valid: A free port in Ploce, and a 
small inland port on the Neretva river, which flows into the 
Adriatic Sea about 10 km north of Ploce. Yet the river is not 
navigable at present. That would require difficult construction 
measures. This is all that has become known concerning Mostar 
and access to the Adriatic Sea. 
  [Beindorf] Mr. Wagner, let me ask you a brief final 
question. After yesterday's joint talks, Alija Izetbegovic was 
expected to participate in the news conference. Do you know the 
reasons for his absence? 
  [Wagner] Well, one can only speculate. It is known that the 
German Government, the Foreign Ministry, declared its readiness 
to arrange a joint news conference if agreement is reached 
during the talks. This means that a joint news conference was 
only planned in the event of a positive outcome. However, this 
is not the case. No positive or specific result has been 
achieved. Izetbegovic departed for Sarajevo this morning, and 
he may present his report to the press there today. Franjo 
Tudjman gave a news conference here at 1100. It has also become 
known that a quarrel erupted behind the scenes between the 
delegations of the Muslims and the Croats and the Foreign 
Ministry because no joint news conference was arranged.

  [Text] Journalists showed great interest in the Croatian 
view of the negotiations in the Croatian Embassy in Bonn this 
morning. The majority of the journalists' questions referred to 
the cease-fire agreement -- an agreement which the Croatian side 
had put forward -- and the status of Neum. We are singling out 
as particularly important remarks made by the Croatian president 
regarding the results and conclusions of the NATO summit in 
Brussels: 
  [Begin Croatian President Franjo Tudjman recording] It was 
with great expectations that the world awaited the NATO 
conclusions. As far as we are concerned, we can be pleased with 
those points referring to the crisis in former Yugoslavia, 
particularly the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. These conclusions 
for the first time show a higher level of resolve to apply 
force, air strikes not only against those who are strangling 
Sarajevo, but also against those who are preventing the passage 
of humanitarian aid, and also against those who are threatening 
certain areas by their offensive combat operations. This is very 
important for us, as this directly refers to the current Muslim 
offensive in central Bosnia. From that point of view, it seems 
that these conclusions will also contribute to speeding up and 
concluding negotiations on restoring peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Belgrade, 11 Jan (TANJUG) -- Serbian Patriarch 
Pavle has never said that the Macedonians have the right to 
their own church at any of the meetings between delegations of 
the Serbian Orthodox Church and representatives of the 
self-proclaimed Macedonian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Pavle's 
office said in a statement today. This was the reaction of the 
Belgrade Patriarchate to the claim by Archbishop Mihail, 
newly-elected head of the Macedonian Orthodox Church, which have 
recently been published in the media, that Patriarch Pavle said 
that "Macedonians are a people, they have their state, and they 
have the right to have their own church." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by P.Dz.: "Are `Liquidation Groups' Being </F>
Formed?"] 
  [Text] Within the framework of the Tetovo PDP [Party for 
Democratic Prosperity] branch, 55 out of the total number of 70 
subbranches are asking for an urgent assembly of the branch. 
According to information from sources close to the Congress 
Preparatory Committee, these subbranches have submitted 
officially signed requests. 
  That can signify that the leader of the so-called PDP "hard 
line," Menduh Taci, is losing support in the most powerful 
branch of the party. An assembly of the branch is expected to 
take place this week and it is possible that Taci will not get 
enough votes to be president of the branch, member of the PDP 
Central Assembly, or delegate. Such an outcome could imply that 
Taci would not be able to participate in the PDP Congress 
scheduled for 15 January. It looks as if the field actions of 
the group of delegates and ministers have started producing 
results, and the group is winning over Taci and his adherents. 
  In Tetovo, like Gostivar, half of the subbranches are asking 
for the assembly, and that speaks much about the fact that the 
"hard line" is losing support in the Polog region, where Taci 
initially received great support. 
  However, will Taci and his group quietly accept losing their 
positions? Some political circles in Tetovo claim that it is 
possible that Taci will use force to try to stop the assembly 
and the congress. He gave a statement in that spirit to Radio 
Kumanovo. There are also rumors in Tetovo that so-called "groups 
for the liquidation" of outstanding PDP leaders are being 
formed. If this is true, it means that the PDP division is 
entering a new and very dangerous phase.

<H5>  The Holding of the Congress Wary </H5>
  An early PDP Congress has been announced for 15 and 16 
January in Tetovo, officially signed and sealed in Macedonia. 
On the occasion of the announcement, we visited the PDP 
headquarters in Macedonia in order to find out the details about 
the preparations and the agenda of the mentioned Congress. 
There, we met a number of PDP members, including Mahi Nesimi, 
who is in charge of the Information Service and a member of the 
Congress Preparatory Committee. 
  "The PDP Congress will be held in Tetovo when the necessary 
conditions are provided and when it is convened by the Congress 
Preparatory Committee," Mahi Nesimi told us. We did not get an 
answer to when the twice postponed news conference, announced by 
PDP President Nevzat Halili, will be held.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Railroad Track Macedonia-Bulgaria"] </F>
  [Text] The railroad link up of Macedonia with Bulgaria is 
soon expected to be realized. In Macedonia, two lines, in the 
direction Kocani-Blagoevgrad (Bulgaria) or Kumanovo-Guesevo 
(Bulgaria), are envisaged. The route Kocani-Blagoevgrad 
foresees the construction of a new track long 145 km, and which 
will cost $430 million. The second route Kumanovo-Guesevo 
consists of a track long 46 km, at the cost of $120 million. 
The direction Kumanovo-Guesevo is given the advantage, in view 
of the costs and the quick realization. The public in Kocani is 
complaining about this and believes that the government is not 
well informed as to the advantages of this route, which would 
connect their own town with Bulgaria.

  [Text] In a public communique, the Kosova Democratic 
Alliance [LDK] Presidency condemns the application of a tax of 
10 German marks [DM] to cross the border. The communique states 
that, starting 1 January 1994, another extraordinary obstacle 
was added. For every exit, even to Macedonia, the Serbian 
authorities want travelers to pay a tax of DM10 per person and 
DM30 per vehicle. Another measure, completely contrary to the 
elementary rights of free circulation, was added to the 
infuriated regime of crossing the border. With this, the 
communication between Albanians of Kosova and Macedonia and 
those of diaspora were reduced to a minimum. Thus, a vital 
interest is infringed and the Albanian population is practically 
placed under an almost complete isolation in the eyes of the 
European powers and the international public. 
  The LDK presidency strongly protests all these limitations 
and asks that such measures be immediately abolished. The 
presidency hopes that its request will encounter understanding 
by the international public and will enjoy support in its demand 
for immediately invalidating all obstacles of free circulation, 
the communique says.

<F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar by </F>
unidentified reporter on 11 January; place not given -- live or 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Reporter] Prime Minister, the meeting between 
representatives of the four countries of the Visegrad group and 
U.S. President Bill Clinton is to begin tomorrow. In this 
connection the remark made by the British Prime Minister John 
Major yesterday did not come out very optimistically; in 
connection with the Partnership for Peace program as well as in 
connection with our possible entry into NATO, he mentioned only 
Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic. This was, however, not 
the first time that Slovakia has been somewhat forgotten. What 
do you see as the main reason for western countries adopting 
such an attitude? 
  [Meciar] In the case of Mr. Major, this did not amount to a 
fundamental political attitude. He was merely citing countries 
as an example. What was decisive for us were the discussions 
which we had with the U.S. delegation last Sunday, and those 
discussions were positive. They involved several important 
areas. The first one was that the question is no longer of who 
will join NATO. The question is only when and how. The second 
fundamental question is that the United States has an interest 
in the security of the Slovak Republic. It belongs to its 
sphere of immediate interests and we also discussed ways of what 
kind of guarantees should be given to that security. The third 
important area is that the Slovak government accepts without any 
reservations and comments the Partnership for Peace in the form 
it has been proposed. Already today the government has 
instructed ministers to set up a working commission to enable us 
to be among the first ones to conclude that agreement. We are 
not concerned to be the first in respect of wanting to compete 
against time, or in terms of prestige. We merely want this 
matter to be resolved as soon as possible. The contractual 
principle will enable contractual adjustments to all relations 
which are of interest to both sides. They involve both our 
interest and the interest of NATO. 
  Furthermore, in Prague tomorrow, apart from this question, 
we 
will also discuss bilateral questions of Slovak-U.S. relations. 
Here, too, we are interested in intensifying them. The message 
Mrs Albright read out to me as the message from President 
Clinton was more than encouraging. 
  [Reporter] Would it be possible to say at this moment that 
after the recent talks with Mrs Albright our chances for gaining 
entry to NATO are good? 
  [Meciar] They are at least as certain as Polish, Hungarian, 
and the Czech Republic. They are not worse. 
  [Reporter] Prime Minister, this is in effect your first 
interview for the media this year. I would therefore like to 
ask you what the government's working program will look like 
this year. 
  [Meciar] The government will devote itself to fundamental 
problems in 1994. [passage omitted] It is necessary to focus on 
practical problems and not on questions of who is against whom 
and who will triumph over whom. The outcome then will be 
commensurate with what we want to achieve. Parties which will 
want to cooperate with us will find partners in us. 
  [Reporter] Another meeting of the parliament is approaching. 
It is rumored that apart from the proposal to dismiss Minister 
Hofbauer, the opposition is again gathering support to force a 
vote of no confidence in the government. It has been even 
reported in the press today that Mr. Cernak [chairman of the 
Slovak National Party] has been having talks with some 
representatives of the Hungarian political parties in this 
connection. Are you aware of these attempts, and how do you 
assess them? 
  [Meciar] To force a vote of no confidence in the government, 
it is necessary to secure 76 votes in the parliament. If they 
are gathered, then the vote of no confidence will succeed. I 
regard this, however, as hardly probable. Talks between 
political parties about when and how to overthrow the government 
have been going on for several months even in the highest 
places. This is borne out by the call made by Mr. President on 
1 January 1994 which I regard as very unfortunate and 
inappropriate. 
  As regard circumstances determining political peace -- 
everyone has to know what he or she wants to provoke. There is 
no other alternative to the government. It would be simple to 
drive the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia into opposition but 
who would then form a constructive government? To provoke 
elections may mean for those who are sowing the wind at present 
that they will not be in the next parliament. Decision making 
in this respect is therefore relatively complicated. 
  I regard privatization issue as being the key problem that 
will face the January plenary session of the parliament. The 
Party of the Democratic Left has made certain proposals that 
would lead to a system that would be akin to Treuhand used by 
the Federal Republic of Germany, in its eastern part, which I 
regard as rather unfortunate and inappropriate for the Slovak 
economy and economic policy. We shall therefore have to discuss 
it to ensure that the matter is resolved if possible before the 
parliament meets. 
  [Reporter] It has been rumored that a certain tension is 
prevailing in the government. It has been specifically rumored 
that Vice Premier Roman Kovac and minister Moravcik may be 
dismissed. Can you either confirm or reject these reports? 
  [Meciar] Two conditions must be met if they are to be 
dismissed from their posts, either the parliament forces a vote 
of no confidence in them and I know nothing about it, or the 
premier will propose their dismissal and I also know nothing 
about it. 
  [Reporter] The recent Saturday meeting in Komarno is still, 
so to say, a hot issue. What is the government's stance to the 
results of this meeting? 
  [Meciar] Roman Kovac, as the first deputy premier in charge 
of minorities issues, is authorized to take stance on behalf of 
the government. 
  As for the Komarno meeting, it has to be perceived from 
several points of views, and the possibility of assessing it 
varies accordingly. It begins by assessing the declaration 
which continues in a pressure system calling for a certain 
arrangement that would eventually stop, and ends by assessing 
the definitive goal, the secession [sentence as received]. This 
is already an area where such statements and political interests 
come into conflict with the constitution. 
  The territorial set-up must be perceived from a broader 
perspective, not merely as a set-up determined by the language. 
[passage omitted] 
  We need to build the republic on the principle of civic 
solidarity and not on the language principle. [passage omitted] 
  It is important that citizens of Hungarian origin distanced 
themselves from those who think that they can speak on behalf of 
all. [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] Does it mean that you consider the results of the 
Komarno meeting to be legitimate and that you are going to 
discuss this issue or that you are going to deal with it in a 
more systematic way? 
  [Meciar] I am not going to discuss the integrity of the 
Slovak Republic's territory and its division, or steps that 
could lead to the violation of this territory, with anybody. 
There is nothing to discuss. This is a topic that will not be 
discussed with me. 
  As for the demands that are related to some of the 
requirements regarding the state administration, there can be an 
opinion on small districts [obvod] that are to be be defined 
within the territorial set-up. However, no ethnic principle 
will be applied in Slovakia. It is not possible for us to force 
somebody from Medzibrodie to travel to Komarno to get his 
planning permission, and lose two days just because of that. 
That is absolutely unworkable. There are also a number of 
other activities that cannot be carried out in this way. 
  To summarize, the territorial set-up being drafted by the 
government reflects the historical development of Slovakia. It 
reflects either the large counties [zupa] after Czechoslovakia 
was established or the territorial set-up that was in force here 
until 1960-61, or -- in the event that they are not satisfied, 
there is the danger of returning to three large regions 
[sentence as heard]. [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] Thank you for the interview.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik by studio </F>
announcer Pospisilova in Bratislava--live] 
  [Excerpts] [Pospisilova] [passage omitted] A short while 
ago, Minister of Foreign Affairs Jozef Moravcik told the 
government that we want to use the Prague session not simply to 
yet again reiterate the Slovak Republic's interest in NATO 
membership, but also to present a major initiative toward 
intensifying economic contacts between the United States and the 
Slovak Republic. Minister Moravcik is now at the microphone. 
  Minister, let us first go back to yesterday's Brussels 
summit. British Prime Minister John Major, speaking at the 
summit, characterized the Partnership for Peace as an 
evolutionary program that could lead to NATO membership--but for 
some countries only. What will the Slovak Republic have to do in 
order to, in John Major's words, find its place among those 
selected countries? What is it that Slovakia can and is willing 
to offer? 
  [Moravcik] The summit passed a very important document, the 
summit statement. It should be signed by all of the countries 
wanting to join the project, and the government of the Slovak 
Republic is ready to sign it. Following a government decision, a 
special group, consisting of Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
Ministry of Defense officials, will be set up in the next few 
days in order to prepare and realize the signing of the relevant 
documents. 
  [Pospisilova] Minister, don't you think that in the past few 
days some well-known foreign politicians and mass media 
eliminated Slovakia from the process of joining NATO, even 
before the process could start? For example, CNN television used 
the argument that Slovakia's interest in joining NATO was not 
quite as obvious as the interest demonstrated by Poland, the 
Czech Republic, and Hungary. What do you think Slovakia has done 
to deserve such treatment, subtle as it is? 
  [Moravcik] I am not aware that we have been pursuing NATO 
membership less keenly than other Visegrad Four countries. We 
have used every occasion to present our position quite clearly. 
[passage omitted]. I would not read too much into such 
statements because, in all my personal dealings with foreign 
representatives--and some of them have failed now and then to 
mention Slovakia as a country keen to join NATO--I received 
assurances that Slovakia was counted in the same way as the rest 
of the Visegrad group countries. In assessing the situation 
objectively, we find there is no reason whatsoever to think that 
Slovakia is less well prepared as a partner than anyone else. We 
are definitely in the first group. 
  [Pospisilova] Apart from meeting Bill Clinton, you will have 
bilateral talks with the members of other delegations. Are you 
going to discuss the demands of the Hungarian minority in 
Slovakia with your Hungarian counterpart? 
  [Moravcik] The position of the Hungarian minority can be 
dealt with only in the context of our effort to prepare an 
all-European document. In all other respects, the position of 
the Hungarian minority in our country is our internal affair.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "Slovakia Will Not Become a Toy in the Hands </F>
of the Strong"] 
  [Excerpt] Trencin -- A festive rally of Army of the Slovak 
Republic commanders was held in Trencin yesterday, on the 
occasion of the beginning of the second year of the existence of 
the Slovak Republic and the building of the Army of the Slovak 
Republic. It was attended by Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak, 
Army Commander Lieutenant General Julius Humaj, and senior 
members of the Army of the Slovak Republic Officers' Corps. 
  At the outset of the rally, its participants heard a letter 
addressed by President Michal Kovac to the participants in the 
rally. The letter states, among other things, that in the 
security and political spheres, we are oriented unequivocally 
toward NATO and the West European Union (WEU). We are looking 
for guarantees to ensure that Slovakia will never again become a 
toy in the hands of the strong. 
  As Michal Kovac went on to stress, according to ideas 
communicated by former U.S. Defense Secretary Les Aspin, 
participation by the Slovak Republic, along with the other 
states of the Visegrad Group, in the Partnership for Peace 
initiative should serve as an intermediary organizational link 
on the road toward fully fledged NATO membership. This should 
mean the possibility of achieving a certain type of associate 
membership of NATO or the WEU. According to Michal Kovac, this 
would not require full integration of the military components, 
but should at least contain guarantees that the parties will be 
consulted whenever the territorial integrity, political 
independence, or security of either party will be jeopardized, 
in the opinion of one of them. 
  In another part of his letter, Michal Kovac appreciated the 
fact that, in defiance of complicated conditions, the division 
of the former Federal Army has been completed in a relatively 
short period of time. He assured Army members that he will see 
to it that all necessary conditions be established for the Army 
of the Slovak Republic to discharge its duties and for it to be 
accorded such a degree of social recognition as corresponds to 
the nature and significance of its work for the benefit of the 
Slovak Republic. [passage omitted]

today a written statement in which the ministry expresses its

for Hungarian minorities abroad. The specific reason for the 
ministry's concern is that this office drafted and disseminated 
in foreign diplomatic circles information on the so-called 
Komarno initiative that takes matters out of context and, 
according to our ministry, is nonobjective and misleading. The 
Foreign Ministry said Slovakia did all it could to meet specific 
obligations it had accepted on joining the Council of Europe.

<F P=106> [Interview with Miklos Duray, chairman of the Coexistence </F>
(Egyutteles) Movement, by Ivan Durcik; place and date not given: 
"Autonomy Is Parliament's Business"] 
  [Text] [Durcik] The official program of the Komarno rally 
no longer mentions the possibility of establishing autonomy. 
If, nonetheless, autonomy got onto the rally's agenda, what 
would be the response of your movement, which endorsed the 
convening of this undertaking? 
  [Duray] Should there be discussion about self-administration 
in Komarno, we can only endorse this view. Reinforcing the role 
of self-administration bodies is in the interest not only of the 
people of Zitny Ostrov [Rye Island, Hungarian-populated area in 
southern Slovakia] but of all residents of the Slovak Republic. 
This is the only realistic option, because the only democratic 
way to achieve autonomy is by means of a law. And for such a 
law to be passed, it is necessary to gain a majority in 
parliament. 
  [Durcik] Do you want to suggest that the term "autonomy" did 
not figure even on the original agenda of the Komarno rally? 
  [Duray] No. The Hungarian parties that endorsed this rally 
(Coexistence and the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement -- 
SLOVENSKY DENNIK note) have never spoken about territorial 
autonomy. What we want is a system of self-administration, in 
which communities and regions would have the powers that they 
need to deal independently with the problems of the local 
population. 
  [Durcik] The Slovak Government is in a difficult situation. 
The coalition is not working and the results in the economic 
sector are very weak. Do you not think that, by organizing 
activities such as the Komarno rally, the Hungarian minority is 
voluntarily getting into the role of a culprit, whom the 
government can blame for every failure? 
  [Duray] It is true that Prime Minister Meciar is intensively 
looking for people whom he could blame for his own failures. By 
creating the image of an enemy, the present government is trying 
to lay all the blame on the Hungarian minority, opposition 
politicians, disloyal journalists, and so forth. It is not our 
activities that directly help the government, however, but, 
rather, the stands of some "opposition" politicians. During the 
vote on the budget, our deputies voted in unison against the 
government draft, while the chairman of the strongest opposition 
party and one Christian Democratic Movement deputy supported the 
government draft. To ascribe their voting to the fact that the 
Hungarians were organizing a rally in Komarno would be a bit 
much. 
  [Durcik] Recently you mentioned that you could imagine a 
broader government coalition with the participation of your 
movement, as well as the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
[HZDS], in the event that there is a change of prime minister. 
Do you think that the demands of the Hungarian minority would be 
easier to realize without Meciar? 
  [Duray] I do not see the main problem in one person but, 
rather, in people's thinking. It is as though, after obtaining 
independence, the Slovaks were surprised to find out that there 
are also Hungarians in Slovakia. Through our activities, we 
want to draw the attention of our Slovak fellow citizens to the 
fact that we live here and that we want to coexist with them as 
citizens with equal rights. This aim is also to be served by 
our rally in Komarno.

  [Text] A special declaration issued by the Bulgarian 
Foreign Ministry of the Republic of Bulgaria regarding the NATO 
summit held in Brussels states as follows: 
  The Partnership for Peace initiative is a qualitatively new 
step in the relations between the partner countries and NATO. 
  We welcome with satisfaction the North Atlantic Alliance's 
readiness to open up in relation to the problems of security in 
Eastern Europe and to accept new members in the future. We 
regard the holding of consultations with NATO in the event of an 
immediate threat to the security of certain Central and Eastern 
European countries as one the most promising and useful forms of 
political cooperation within the framework of the initiative. 
  The Republic of Bulgaria declares its interest in taking 
part 
in the implementation of the Partnership for Peace initiative, 
which is in conformance with Bulgaria's readiness to share the 
responsibility for strengthening stability and security in 
Europe.

  [Text] The Agency for Bulgarians Abroad is concerned over 
the new exit fees imposed by the Republic of Serbia, under which 
every citizen of the Republic has to pay a fee of 10 German 
marks [DM] per person and DM30 for a private vehicle when 
departing from the country for abroad. These fees make it 
difficult for our compatriots in the Western Outlands [border 
region of Serbia inhabited by ethnic Bulgarians] to maintain 
contacts with their friends and relatives in Bulgaria and limits 
their possibilities of visiting our country, which in many cases 
is for them the only way of obtaining essential goods. 
  The Agency for Bulgarians Abroad proposes that the competent 
Bulgarian institutions should take steps through diplomatic 
channels to obtain exemption from the exit fees for Yugoslav 
citizens of Bulgarian nationality, especially those living in 
the municipalities near the border and those who have close 
relatives in Bulgaria.

<F P=106> [24 CHASA staff report: "Valentin Aleksandrov Fires Army </F>
Chiefs"] 
  [Text] [Defense Minister] Valentin Aleksandrov fired 
Colonel Valentin Popinski, chief of the "Supply and Trade" 
Administration, and his deputy, Colonel Stoyan Tsakov, for 
breach of discipline, a well-informed source reported on 5 
January. 
  The defense minister did not give the reason for the 
dismissal of the two officers. We have learned that the two 
officers were responsible for carrying out deals in military and 
other production of the ministry's economic unit, known as 
Defense Ministry-2. 
  The source notes that if the dismissal was for corruption, 
the accused will be temporarily suspended and their case 
transferred to the prosecutor's office. 
  One rumor has it that Popinski and Tsakov have been removed 
because of the so-called Albanian deal. 
  In September the Defense Ministry sold 100 mortars (120-mm) 
and mines to Tirana. The arms were transported with Albanian 
trucks. 
  The deal was cleared with the government team for the 
defense 
industry, General Simeon Petkovski from the Defense Ministry, 
said. The suspicion exists, however, that a part of the mortars 
arrived in Bosnia instead of Tirana. However, our military 
merchants were not responsible for the Albanian trucks' route 
and destination.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Neven Kopandanova: "A Colossus on Feet of </F>
Clay"] 
  [Text] No matter how cleverly the Socialists are trying to 
conceal not only the visible cracks in their party's unity, but 
also the lack of clear concepts for the country's future 
development, likely to conform with the preferences of their 
electorate, BSP leader Zhan Videnov's visit, which he paid to 
the headquarters of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS], at 134 
Rakovski Street, yesterday, revealed even more transparently the 
weakness of the 100- year-old party. The fact that the 
Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] is trying to restrict the 
president's prerogatives, or even to replace him, has long since 
been discussed, not only behind the closed doors of the BSP 
headquarters at 20, Positano Street. The present initiative of 
the Socialists can hardly be defined as the result of their 
foreboding about forthcoming elections, alone. One of the 
latest causes of concern for Videnov's people seems to be a 
possible, new reorganization of the parliamentary structures 
under the aegis of the head of state. The separation of living 
political organisms such as the Civic Alliance for the Republic 
[GOR] and of the Alliance for Social Democracy [OSD] from the 
aging body of the BSP, which is evidently underway, would 
deprive the giant party from its control over parliamentary 
events and from the possibility of overthrowing the government 
at a convenient time. 
  The fact that the president himself is no longer a decisive 
force in political life is beyond any doubt. However, the 
danger that he might stand behind a vigorous parliamentary 
center force, or even support the SDS, a possibility that has 
been repeatedly hinted at from the president's headquarters on 
2, Dondukov Street, evidently suffices to cause panic among the 
Socialists, whose political isolation would be devastating in 
such case. By further stimulating the antipresidential campaign 
of the SDS, the BSP will presumably rely on threatening our head 
of state with the SDS guillotine, while trying to make the 
Democrats more open for reconciliation with their chief 
opponent, at the same time, and acting as a balancing force 
between the centers of power so as to preserve control over the 
situation. 
  The political game of the Socialists who are trying to pull 
the strings of the government, while distancing themselves from 
it at the same time, has long since been unsuccessful. Their 
current attempt at sharing the responsibility with others, which 
they tried yesterday, will hardly be more effective. It would 
be naive to believe that the colossus on clay feet, as the BSP 
can already be described, could rely on a supportive crutch from 
the SDS. 
  We can presume that SDS leader Filip Dimitrov will be 
subject 
to a new series of attacks by his fellow party members. The 
attacks are most likely to come from those who, until recently, 
accused him of preventing the dialogue with other political 
forces. Nevertheless, the SDS leader confirmed that those 
capable of exploiting their opponent's failures are the real 
winners in the political game.

  [Text] The Defense Ministry spokesman reports that 
yesterday a watchtower guard for the Navy forces observed a 
Greek patrol ship entering Albanian territorial waters south of 
Qefal Cape at approximately 1610. At 1615, after approaching 
within 1 mile of the Albanian coast, this Greek military ship 
fired a volley. The ship not only violated our territorial 
waters but sailed in these waters for 20 minutes. The ship left 
after a torpedo boat of the Sarande coastal district appeared. 
  The Defense Ministry spokesman declares that this is not the 
only case. As we have reported before, on 5 November 1993 the 
Greek military ship Matis violated our territorial waters and 
sailed eight miles into our territory. On 4 January 1994 
another Greek ship entered our waters and opened fire against an 
Albanian motor boat which was fishing within our territorial 
waters. 
  The Defense Ministry reports that these actions by Greek 
patrol ships constitute serious violations of the territorial 
waters of the Republic of Albania. The Ministry protests and 
asks the appropriate Greek bodies to prevent these cases, 
because the use of firearms within the territory of Albanian 
Navy waters runs in flagrant opposition to international laws 
and conventions. All these constitute a serious provocation 
within Albanian territorial waters and infringe upon the 
relations of good-neighborliness between the two countries. 
  We also want to make known that the Albanian Navy forces are 
engaged and ready to energetically act to preserve the 
inviolability of Albanian territorial waters.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec by Ladislav </F>
Zak; place and date not given: "Fear of Russia"] 
  [Text] [Zak] Do you believe that the situation in Russia 
represents a certain danger for our region? Are there any 
concerns about developments there? 
  [Zieleniec] Of course there exist concerns about 
developments 
in Russia or, to be precise, in the entire territory of the 
former USSR, and not only in our region. They are shared with us 
by all of Europe, indeed by the entire world. Let us realize 
that it is a power armed with a nuclear arsenal, a state in 
which new democratic arrangements are being introduced only with 
difficulties. There are no democratic traditions in Russia. 
Traditions are very important phenomena. Russia is struggling 
against tremendous internal problems, the problems of the 
minorities within the country, and the large number of Russian 
minorities outside its territory. This country has experienced 
70 years of communism, and we, who lived under it for 40 years, 
know what a tremendous burden it is, how difficult it is to 
implement reforms, from economic to legal ones. For a long time 
to come, developments in Russia will continue to be a source of 
uncertainty on the one hand, and a subject of interest and 
desire for stabilization on the other--not only to us but to the 
entire world. 
  [Zak] To what degree can Russia's taking exception to NATO's 
eastward expansion affect the decisionmaking of the West on this 
matter? 
  [Zieleniec] We should consider these matters with some 
restraint because of the present postelectoral situation in 
Russia. Regarding the alliance associations of the Czech 
Republic, we should clearly define our goal and go directly 
after it. After all, it is not possible to indefinitely prolong 
a situation where countries that have always been part of 
European history--such as our republic--are to live on the side 
of the, albeit collapsed but still existent, curtain drawn by 
Stalin. Therefore, I believe that our integration into the 
family of West European countries, including institutional 
integration--that is, also into NATO--is unavoidable. In the 
long term, any endeavors to derive a solution for European 
stability solely from developments in Russia will prove wrong. 
Developments in Russia will certainly be very complex and 
dynamic, and our integration is a matter so incontestable that 
it has to happen sooner or later--including membership in the 
relevant organizations. 
  [Zak] Would it not be more pragmatic in this situation to 
coordinate our efforts with those of Poland, Hungary, and, 
possibly, Slovakia? 
  [Zieleniec] I believe that this is the case. We have 
identical interests and say similar things. It is a matter of 
course. 
  [Zak] You mentioned the postelectoral situation in Russia. 
Do 
you believe that the "shriek" of the Russian side regarding the 
expansion of NATO eastward has something precisely to do with 
the internal political situation, or do the external power 
interests of Russia still exist? Is there danger of this 
situation coming to a head--that is, that we would play "second 
fiddle" in talks that will take place mostly between NATO and 
Russia--that is, "about us without us?" 
  [Zieleniec] Russia undoubtedly has its interests and 
articulates them. The West must have its interests, too, and, 
just the same, we have ours. I believe that, from this point of 
view, the space in which we are located together with Poland, 
Slovakia, and Hungary should be outside Russia's sphere of 
operations--and clearly within the West's sphere of influence. 
It is apparent that there are attempts to cooperate with Russia 
and that they are appropriate. There is no point, and it would 
not be in anyone's interest, in starting new hostilities, when 
they are not necessary. This does not necessarily imply anything 
about the future shape of West Europe or its institutional 
umbrella. The attempts on the part of NATO to get along with 
Russia certainly do not banish us from Europe. 
  [Zak] What is the concept of our foreign policy eastward 
with 
respect to the present situation in Russia? 
  [Zieleniec] Developments in Russia following the elections 
remain for us a great unknown. Nevertheless, our policy from 
this vantage point is clear. The territory of the former USSR, 
and Russia in particular, is for us a country of traditional 
contacts and business interests, and we are trying to be very 
active in this type of cooperation. On the other hand, we always 
emphasize that these relations must be based on equality, and 
our political orientation, our orientation in terms of future 
integration, is tied to the fate of West Europe. Nevertheless, I 
would like to point out that general laws of geometry cannot be 
applied in politics: If you turn to face someone, it does not 
mean that you are turning your back on someone else. It simply 
is not so. 
  [Zak] Could you comment on the statements by some Russian 
politicians that, if a NATO expansion eastward occurs, we will 
automatically become the target of Russian nuclear weapons? 
  [Zieleniec] Nowadays, nuclear arms are pointed at all kinds 
of targets; it is simply two sides of the same coin. If, 
however, we want to participate in the protection of the values 
of democracy, individual freedom, and a prosperous market 
economy, we have to expect that someone will not like it. 
Nevertheless, I do not see any reason why a willingness to 
protect these values evokes in Russia contemplation about arms. 
  [Zak] What about the statements by Yeltsin and Kozyrev about 
the isolation of Russia and concerns of the so-called ordinary 
Russian citizens about the possible expansion of NATO? Do you 
not feel as if this originated in the vocabulary of the old-time 
communist ideologists? 
  [Zieleniec] I do not know. Russia has always thought very 
geopolitically. The problem of isolation is well known in Russia 
because it has been discussed there probably throughout the 
entire existence of that country. Developments in Russia have 
always coincided with the clash of two trends--a pro-Western one 
and a national one leading to closing oneself. There is nothing 
left but to wish for ourselves and Russia that democracy 
prevails and that cooperation among all of the countries of 
Europe, including Russia, be as close as possible. 
  [Zak] Let us look even more closely toward our borders--at 
Ukraine. Although it has ratified the START 1 Treaty on the 
nonproliferation of nuclear arms, the overall outcome is rather 
awkward. Is there also a threat from the Ukrainian side? 
  [Zieleniec] No. Ukraine's problems are more or less 
eastern-oriented. They are the problems of a new state that has 
emerged from the womb of the USSR. I believe that this has more 
to do with the general nonproliferation of nuclear arms than a 
real threat to our region.

<F P=106> [Article by (km): "Minister Baudys Is Concerned About the </F>
Russian Military Doctrine"] 
  [Excerpt] Prague--Defense Minister Antonin Baudys yesterday 
expressed concern about the possible consequences of the Russian 
Federation's military doctrine, which, in the event of a threat 
to the country's security interests, allows for the 
possibility--maybe--of deploying Russian troops outside the 
territory of the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
  "Some of the passages in this military doctrine, which refer 
to strategic territories and to the possibility of deploying 
Russian troops outside the Russian Federation and perhaps even 
the CIS states, cause me considerable concern, because these are 
not pronouncements made by Mr. Zhirinovskiy, who changes his 
views very rapidly, but are contained in the state military 
doctrine," declared Baudys. 
  In reply to a question on whether Russia is continuing to 
take the Czech Republic's territory into consideration in the 
interests of its security, Minister Baudys said: "I do not know, 
but the formulation of this issue in the doctrine disturbs me." 
  Minister Baudys considers the stance adopted by Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin on the possible expansion of NATO to 
include certain East European states to be schizophrenic. "On 
the one hand, President Yeltsin is saying that he does not want 
Russia to be outmaneuvered and not taken into consideration in 
the expansion processes, while, on the other hand, he is afraid 
of NATO's expansion. This is a schizophrenic situation, and I 
simply do not understand it," said Baudys. 
  The statement made by the Russian president on Wednesday [5 
January], in which he again emphatically rejected the attempts 
to expand the North Atlantic Alliance, has, according to Baudys, 
two aspects. "Boris Yeltsin says that the countries of Central 
and East Europe must make their own decisions regarding their 
possible incorporation into NATO. The other face of President 
Yeltsin says, however, that it is necessary to respect certain 
of Russia's strategic interests. This other face rather disturbs 
me," he said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The coalition parties [the Civic Democratic Party, 
the Civic Democratic Alliance, the Christian Democratic 
Union--Czechoslovak People's Party, and the Christian Democratic 
Party] assess positively the U.S. project Partnership for Peace, 
which was approved by the top officials of NATO countries in 
Brussels yesterday [10 January]. 
  The Czech Social Democratic Party and the Liberal Social 
National Party are also positive about the project. All of the 
above consider this project to be, first of all, the first step 
to the desirable cooperation of the Czech Republic with NATO. 
  The Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia and the Left Bloc 
disagree with this opinion. They warn against our joining NATO 
because they see a possible isolation in relation to the 
remaining partners within the Visegrad Four, as well as the 
threat of cutting down on our sovereignty.

Dollar Debt"] 
  [Text] Prague--By repaying $40 million yesterday, Slovakia 
settled the debt it incurred in mutual trade with the Czech 
Republic when it overdrew its permitted credit margin. However, 
Slovakia is still some 4.5 billion korunas in debt in the mutual 
clearing account and, at the moment, is again exceeding the 
agreed margin. "This tendency is continuing in January; Slovakia 
is again drawing above the credit margin," said Ota Kaftan, of 
the Czech National Bank [CNB]. Despite these problems, the 
clearing method of settling accounts in mutual trade is 
maintainable for the foreseeable future, and the CNB is taking 
this into consideration.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Defense Minister Lajos Fur by </F>
Zoltan Fekete; place and date not given: "The Forum Overcame 
Its Internal Conflicts"] 
  [Text] Defense Minister Lajos Fur resigned from the 
position of executive chairman of the Hungarian Democratic Forum 
[MDF] on 26 May 1993. Although he maintained his membership in 
the Executive Committee, Lajos Fur accepted larger political 
roles in the party's internal life only recently. 
  [Fekete] Would you accept a renewed nomination for the 
position of executive chairman or the position of party chairman 
if you were asked now, or your volunteer withdrawal continues? 
  [Fur] I do not hide from rational challenges of fate. 
  [Fekete] In other words, you would accept the nomination. 
  [Fur] If I am asked to or if I am elected, I will accept. 
  [Fekete] What has changed since your resignation? 
  [Fur] My party has changed a lot since I wrote my letter. I 
do not mean here the change in the external and internal image 
of the party, but mostly the changes that took place in the 
people's souls. Of course, we should not forget that the MDF 
did not disintegrate after the split and, after the well-known 
internal conflicts, we are now much more united than before. 
Our members have a goal again: To be successful at the 
upcoming elections. We not only have goals, but our old 
enthusiasm has returned, and this clearly proves that the MDF 
has overcome its internal conflicts. I feel as if the 
enthusiasm of 1989-90 has returned, and this gives cause for 
optimism. 
  [Fekete] Will the MDF be able to replace the late party 
chairman and prime minister, Jozsef Antall? 
  [Fur] No one is irreplaceable and no one is replaceable. 
Both opinions are true. Jozsef Antall was a great democrat. 
It is impossible to replace him overnight. No matter who it 
is, the future party chairman can grow into a key figure as 
Jozsef Antall used to be. Everyone has the fieldmarshal's baton 
in his bag, but the standards are very high. 
  [Fekete] Has Jozsef Antall's death not thrown Hungary's 
position back? I mean here primarily our foreign policy. 
  [Fur] Although some statement that appeared especially in 
the West mentioned this, and there are also some voices at home 
according to which the government drifted to the right after 
Jozsef Antall's death, these are unfounded opinions. With its 
new interior minister, the Hungarian Government is working 
according to its well- known program. I must say that, during 
my talks so far, I did not feel any deterioration in Hungary's 
leading positions. I met recently not only with the heads and 
defense ministers of the Visegrad countries but also with 
high-ranking U.S. politicians and leaders. 
  [Fekete] As a party chairman, would you be able to create a 
unity similar to the consensus achieved during the legislation 
of the defense law as a defense minister? 
  [Fur] It is much easier to compromise in the Parliament in 
the benefit of the country and society than within the party. 
However, a political party is always created by a common 
ideology, common interests, and common goals. 
  [Fekete] You spoke of enthusiasm. In your opinion, for what 
election results is this enthusiasm sufficient? 
  [Fur] If our enthusiasm grows, our calm continues, and 
"reason prevails" in our society, then our chances will be very 
good. Even if we cannot repeat our last success of 42 percent, 
we can get more than 20 percent of the votes, and we can even be 
the first with this number of votes. 
  [Fekete] What do you mean by the society's "reason"? 
  [Fur] If most people accept the fact that this coalition 
government carried out what its possibilities allowed it to 
carry out, if understanding also mingles with the justified 
criticism, and if an increasing number of people realize that 
another government could not have done much more in this period 
and after such preliminaries, the chances of the MDF will be 
really good.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Lajos Fur by unidentified </F>
reporter on 10 January; place not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter] You once stepped aside as a party 
politician, but now you have again become active. What are your 
aims? 
  [Fur] I started a large-scale tour around the country from 
October and November, and during this tour I will visit all 
counties and have discussions with the leaders and members of 
the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] and hold lectures, since a 
great, a very great test [the election], is coming. 
  I think that if the population, the citizens of the country, 
realize how much the MDF and the coalition government have done, 
and that within the range of possibilities they have done the 
best way that could be done, the Hungarian Democratic Forum will 
win the elections, perhaps not with such a high percentage of 
votes as it obtained in 1990, but I am sure that the respective 
proportion of votes will be above 20 percent. 
  [Reporter] Would you accept the post of party chairman? 
  [Fur] I usually do not evade challenges of my fate, 
particularly when they are sensible challenges. If I have to 
face such a challenge, I will try to meet it.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Ferenc Kulin, head of the </F>
parliamentary group of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, by Tibor 
J. Keri on 10 January; place not given: "Fur Has a Chance To 
Become Party Chairman"] 
  [Text] In the last week's issue of MAGYAR FORUM, Istvan 
Csurka strongly attacked the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] 
and one of its spiritual leader, Janos Kis. Among other things, 
Csurka wrote the following: "With the death of Jozsef Antall, 
with the fall of the silent partner, the Hungarian political 
life became unipolar and the boss is now called Janos Kis." 
According to Csurka, Kis played a decisive role in forcing the 
national trend and the national radicalism out of the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum [MDF]. The present MDF, one that "calms" Kis 
and his followers, "is small, broken, without principles, far 
from its original power, namely its Hungarianness, and from 
taking on the representation of the vital issues of Hungarians; 
a party that has hidden itself in illusions and frequent 
substitute actions; a toothless lion" -- Csurka wrote. 
  Ferenc Kulin said last week that the MDF could not envisage 
any coalition or cooperation with an SZDSZ controlled by Janos 
Kis. 
  My position regarding Janos Kis and the SZDSZ is totally 
independent from Istvan Csurka's article -- Ferenc Kulin told 
our correspondent. From 1989, the SZDSZ has been the anti-pole 
of the political space in which the MDF is the other determining 
factor. This distance only increased, instead of decreasing, in 
the last four years. According to Kulin, this distance became 
even more clear by the fact that the SZDSZ seems to initiate 
cooperation with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], the other 
rival of the MDF. Kulin mentioned Janos Kis because it is Kis 
who has been formulating and dictating the political strategy of 
the SZDSZ from the very beginning. Kulin added that if anyone 
had any doubts about this, these doubts would be dissipated by 
Janos Kis's article published in the Christman issue of MAGYAR 
HIRLAP. "This is the simple explanation to the question of 
whether there is a chance of MDF-SZDSZ cooperation. I can say 
that there is no such chance" -- Kulin declared. 
  According to Ferenc Kulin, the fact that there are no 
chances 
whatsoever of any contact or cooperation between the two parties 
can be explained with pragmatic causes. Kulin pointed out that 
the MDF is a center party that is polished and formed in the 
daily political practice, a party that learns from every 
conflict and corrects them; Janos Kis's SZDSZ is a party 
"created at a desk, a party adjusting itself to doctrines and 
following a strategy." Therefore, it is questionable 
politically whether these two markedly different political 
forces can get closer to each other -- Kulin pointed out. 
  In connection with Csurka's writing, Ferenc Kulin said that 
he did not agree with a single sentence of the essay published 
in MAGYAR FORUM. His judgment differs from his opinions on 
previous Csurka-writings because, in the past, he could accept a 
lot of elements of Csurka's diagnoses. However, this latest 
writing is the spiritual flight of a man who lost his sense of 
political reality -- Kulin said. He added that Csurka's words 
on his role and "danger" are among statements that no longer 
contain anything surprising and, therefore, they need no 
defense. Kulin also finds it unfortunate that the 
"objectionable attack" on Jozsef Antall's activity definitely 
discredited everything that Csurka ever did in Hungarian 
politics. 
  In connection with the future, Kulin pointed out that he 
agreed with Sandor Lezsak, who declared that the corridors that 
were still open between the MDF and the Hungarian Way Circles 
closed definitely in the wake of Csurka's attitude following 
Jozsef Antall's death. These contradictions will only become 
stronger in the election campaign. 
  Speaking about the election prospects of the MDF, Kulin said 
that he was even more optimistic than Lajos Fur, who predicted 
20 percent of votes for the MDF. "We still have all the chances 
to achieve a decisive victory in the individual electoral 
districts" -- Kulin said. 
  In conclusion, Kulin pointed out that he would not accept 
even the nomination for the position of party chairman at the 
national conference to be held in February. He did not know how 
many people were running for this position, but he said that 
Lajos Fur had a good chance to win the position.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian </F>
Socialist Party, by Pal Szombathy; place and date not given: "We 
Will Not Be Short of Coalition Partners"] 
  [Text] The discussion on 3 January with [former prime 
minister, now international banker] Miklos Nemeth will end 
speculations about his return to Hungary, Gyula Horn told 
NEPSZABADSAG. Horn said that raising the idea of a future 
liberal-conservative coalition does not show any political 
foresight. In his view, the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] is 
not in danger of finding itself in quarantine and it will find 
coalition partners if it achieves good results at the 
elections. 
  [Szombathy] According to our information, on 3 January, you 
talked to Miklos Nemeth for two and a half hours, and the 
dilemmas of his political return were the topic of the 
conversation. 
  [Horn] It is true that we held a long discussion with 
Nemeth. We agreed that we would soon jointly inform the public 
on the result of our consultation. 
  [Szombathy] Is it correct to assume that your joint 
statement will end the speculations over his possible return to 
Hungary? 
  [Horn] Presumably, yes. 
  [Szombathy] It is not the first time it has been suggested, 
and not only by [Federation of Young Democrats, FIDESZ, 
Chairman] Viktor Orban, that the MSZP should again be refused 
the chance to form a coalition in 1994 by the parties of the 
former Opposition Roundtable. In your view, after four years, 
what are the chances of isolating the MSZP, which certainly 
appears to be on the rise? 
  [Horn] If I took the suggestions of Orban and others 
seriously, then I would also like to ask some questions. For 
example, the liberal parties have very strongly criticized the 
government's policy over the past four years; in fact, many of 
their prominent representatives stated that this executive power 
should be replaced in 1994. In this case, how do they imagine 
new cooperation with the government parties? How seriously are 
we to take everything that they have said over the past four 
years? In the event of cooperation of this type, the two 
liberal parties would join in some kind of continuity with the 
current coalition: If this is so, then they will have to 
explain this to their own supporters and voters. Why were the 
other two parties of the liberal bloc left out of this assumed 
alliance? It was the FIDESZ that said that the liberal 
coalition of four parties would be able to win the elections. 
Finally: Is it really so important for them to get into power 
by all means? In my view, these plans, which even preceded the 
calling of the elections, are distasteful. We can hear little 
about the program that the liberals want to implement. The 
remaining four months will be a serious challenge to the 
country: Raising this kind of proposal at this moment does not 
show political foresight. 
  [Szombathy] Is there a real danger to the MSZP in this kind 
of possible "quarantine attempt"? Can a more or less united bloc 
be established to oppose the MSZP? 
  [Horn] We ended the previous regime four years ago and the 
MSZP played an important role in this. In democracies, parties 
do not normally get excluded from cooperation; this is usually 
done in dictatorships. I do not wish to make predictions, but 
it will be very difficult for the Hungarian Democratic Forum 
[MDF], the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP], the 
Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], and the FIDESZ to cooperate 
without losing their own political image. The leaders of the 
SZDSZ are much more cautious in their statements on this issue; 
presumably their views will become clearer by the time of the 
elections. For me, the important question is whether the 
liberals can agree on the social and economic issues that are 
important for the country. 
  [Szombathy] Do you expect that, in the event of an MSZP 
victory at the elections, the other political forces will firmly 
refuse to form a government with the Socialists ? 
  [Horn] A kind of evolution has taken place in the way in 
which the parliamentary parties treat the MSZP: At first, they 
were condescending toward us, then they spoke about a left-wing 
danger, and now they are alarming the electors by saying that it 
is a waste of time to vote for the Socialists because the MSZP 
would not become a part of the government anyway. In my view, 
if we achieve a good election result, we will find coalition 
partners among the current parliamentary parties. I do not 
think that we will be short of coalition partners. In my view, 
the important issue is what kind of agreement can be made with 
the partners as regards the government's tasks. The current 
nervousness comes from the danger of losing power on one side 
and from the hope of gaining it on the other. The MSZP is not 
suffering from either of these illnesses. 
  [Szombathy] Do you consider it a possibility that the MSZP 
will be forced to turn down the mandate to form a government? 
  [Horn] I do not deal with this issue. In January 1994, I 
find it early and somewhat comical to talk about forming 
coalitions. The MSZP does not want to commit itself on possible 
coalition partners or its prime minister candidate. 
  [Szombathy] According to some people, one of the reasons 
that you have not named anyone as your prime minister candidate 
is that the MSZP does not really have any "marketable" prominent 
people apart from yourself. 
  [Horn] An increasing number of prominent politicians are 
appearing in the party; I could mention at least eight to 10 
names. Unfortunately, the opposition is in a difficult position 
in presenting its politicians on Hungarian Television, which has 
the greatest effect. 
  [Szombathy] Failing all else, can we arrive at a situation 
where the MSZP names [SZDSZ Parliamentary Group Leader] Gabor 
Kuncze as its nominee? 
  [Horn] I would like to affirm that Gabor Kuncze will not be 
our prime minister candidate. Whether the MSZP will support 
Kuncze after the elections is a different issue. It is also to 
be seen whom, in case of a certain result, the SZDSZ would 
support for prime minister from the Socialists.... We will draw 
up our national list in February, but we would not like to 
commit ourselves to anyone. The country is bound to have a 
coalition government. For us, it is not a key issue that the 
leader of the new cabinet should come from the MSZP. The 
structure of the new government must not be decided by loyalty 
to a party. I do not exclude the possibility that the next 
prime minister will not be a leading party politician. 
  [Szombathy] Does this mean that we can be certain that you 
will not nominate a prime minister until the elections? 
  [Horn] Nothing is certain in politics. However, there are 
no rules that say that the leader of the national list has to be 
a candidate at the same time. We will maintain our current view 
on this issue and I do not think that the sensible public will 
fail to understand this. 
  [Szombathy] The view can often be heard that the MSZP is not 
at all interested in getting into government. Is it possible 
that you will be a constructive opposition with a 20 to 25 
percent result? 
  [Horn] We do not want to get into government by any means: 
We would not participate in a coalition that does not agree on 
certain basic economic and political issues, and does not state 
that people living on wages and salaries cannot be burdened 
forever with the costs of the changes. However, it was probably 
our opponents who concocted the story that we are not seriously 
thinking of taking on a governmental role: All serious parties 
work to this end. The new government will only have a chance to 
fulfill its four-year term if it seeks ways for social 
reconciliation. 
  [Szombathy] MSZP members often say that stability can only 
be preserved if the left wing and the trade unions are involved 
in power. In your view, would a left-wing opposition increase 
the chances of a government crisis? 
  [Horn] The new executive will definitely have to come to an 
agreement with the trade unions. The left wing, which fosters 
the best relations with them, has the best chance to do this. 
However, our relations will probably have their problems. 
  [Szombathy] The MSZP's popularity is increasing. The 
question is, how much will your individual candidates be able to 
achieve, coming from different strata of society and entering 
into the competition from different backgrounds. A larger 
parliamentary group can also expect conflicts similar to those 
of the MDF.... 
  [Horn] It is certain that people whom we do not welcome have 
also appeared around the party, but the party's leadership was 
not able to influence the selection of the candidates. However, 
I am not aware of any nominations where the expertise and 
honesty of the candidate was not taken into consideration. I 
can only welcome such a broad range of people. Presumably, 
after the elections, the MSZP's group of deputies will be much 
larger: The professional structure of the parliamentary group 
will be important. Naturally, the number of conflicts increases 
in a larger community. It is a lie to claim that there are any 
people at all among our candidates who returned as former 
leaders after turning their backs on politics in 1990.

  [Excerpt] At the HSP [Hungarian Socialist Party] delegates' 
assembly in Miskolc it was finalized that the party's election 
list in the county will be led by Sandor Nagy, chairman of the 
largest Hungarian trade union grouping. Peter Juhasz reports. 
  [Juhasz] Today it was decided that Sandor Nagy, chairman of 
the MSZOSZ [National Federation of Hungarian Trade Unions], will 
run in the parliamentary elections under the colors of the 
Socialist Party. This was announced by Imre Szekeres, deputy 
chairman of the party, in Miskolc after the HSP county 
organization's session, adding that the regional list will be 
led by Sandor Nagy. 
  [Begin Szekeres recording] I presume that behind this 
decision lies the fact that in the past three and a half years a 
political cooperation developed between the Hungarian Socialist 
Party and the trade union organization in which both 
organizations preserved their independence. We, the leaders of 
the HSP and the Borsod county organization, believe that this 
should also be signalled when putting forward candidates. We 
appointed to the head of the list of a very important county 
like this a well-known and popular person who represents 
people's interests not only in the trade union movement but also 
in social insurance, Dr. Sandor Nagy. [passage omitted] [end

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The 30 December Budapest daily MAGYAR 
HIRLAP reported that the National Federation of Associations of 
Job Seekers and Unemployed (MAEOSZ) believes that the 
unemployment problem is growing despite National Labor Affairs 
Center (OMK) figures that show the opposite. According to the 
paper, MAEOSZ executive president Zoltan Zenkovics and associate 
president Jozsef Simon said in interviews that while OMK data 
claiming a steady drop in unemployment from 700,000 in February 
to 635,000 in November are technically correct, they "do not 
reflect societal developments realistically." Since last spring 
the "official classification criteria used by the labor affairs 
centers have changed," the officials asserted. In any case, they 
said, in 1993 the overall situation of the unemployed "continued 
to deteriorate" because unemployment benefits have been reduced 
from two years to one and the actual value of benefits has 
eroded. "It has therefore become impossible to halt 
impoverishment, and even on the governmental level they admit 
that half a million people will never again be able to return to 
the work force." Long-term unemployment also has an impact on 
the family, creating "a spiral that may go downward with 
frightening speed." While unemployment benefits have have helped 
some people get a new start, in counties such as Nograd, Somogy, 
and Zala most of the unemployed find themselves "without any 
options," the officials said. 
  Zenkovics and Simon charged that government agencies have 
failed to cooperate with MAEOSZ's efforts to improve the 
employment situation. MAEOSZ and the Ministry of Labor worked 
out a "cooperation plan" but MAEOSZ "waited in vain" for an 
actual agreement from that ministry, while the Ministry of 
Public Welfare "did not respond at all" to MAEOSZ's requests. In 
the officials' view, as long as they took "a tolerant stance" 
they could not get the government to "consider them a partner in 
working out a clearly conceived employment policy." Therefore, 
according to MAGYAR HIRLAP, the officials expect that MAEOSZ 
will be "forced" to "resort to other--strictly legal--measures." 
First it will have lawyers examine the parts of the social 
welfare law that appear to be "unconstitutional," and then it 
will express its protests through county meetings and hunger 
strikes.

<F P=106> [Interview with Polish President Lech Walesa by Petr Janyska </F>
in Warsaw; date not given: "The West Is Deceiving Itself"] 
  [Text] I am very disappointed, declared Polish President 
Lech Walesa in an interview for LIDOVE NOVINY just prior to the 
meeting between the four Central European heads of state and the 
U.S. President. With reference to the Czech Government -- which 
has insisted that Clinton meet separately with the 
representatives of each country and that no joint communique be 
adopted -- he said the following: "Solidarity is essential 
during challenging periods. In this case, however, someone is 
placing particular interests before the common cause. Prague's 
course of action disturbs me. Public opinion will not forget 
the politicians in question. In my opinion, they are making a 
mistake that will cost us all something. The outcome will be 
important, not the form. Nevertheless, if the talks end in 
failure, we will be forced to say that it was the fault of the 
organizers. The Slovaks, Hungarians, and Poles wanted to adopt 
a joint course of action. I even proposed that Vaclav Klaus 
deliver a joint statement on behalf of all four countries. He 
did not take up this suggestion, however." 
  [Janyska] Mr. President, what, in your opinion, will the 
NATO summit bring to Poland and Central Europe? Under what 
circumstances will it be possible to talk about success? 
  [Walesa] If a clear concept for Europe's security arises 
from the meeting and if a specific form for our partnership 
derives from it. That is, if a timetable for joint programs is 
set and if it is clearly stated that "Partnership for Peace" 
will lead to our full membership in NATO (even if Russia is 
opposed to this) and if the political and military criteria for 
such membership are determined. 
  We want NATO to enhance its potential as fast as possible by 
evolutionary means and to attach as many European post-communist 
states as possible to its blood circulation system. Two years 
ago, I suggested that Central Europe prepare for entry into NATO 
and this is how I understand "Partnership for Peace." 
  The West is making out that we want something from it. This 
is a mistake; on the contrary, we are offering it something. We 
want to expand the region of its security. Naturally, this will 
also -- in turn -- benefit us. 
  [Janyska] What if only non-specific statements ensue from 
the summit? 
  [Walesa] Then all the moral, political, and military 
responsibility will fall on Western Europe and the United 
States. They used to appeal to us to overthrow communism. We 
got rid of it, the Soviet Union collapsed, and we dissolved the 
Warsaw Pact. And what has the West done in the wake of all of 
this? Central Europe is a vacuum; the only change is the 
reunification of Germany. 
  Here in the Belvedere Palace in August, we managed to obtain 
Yeltsin's written agreement that Russia will not object to our 
joining NATO. This was a unique historical opportunity. A 
political gesture from the West would have been enough: That 
Central Europe has some hope of joining the Alliance and that we 
belong to the West and not the East. The West said nothing, 
however. 
  A course of action such as this one and an insufficiently 
active policy lead to phenomena like Zhirinovskiy. The West 
does not want to provoke the bear; however, the bear perceives 
this cautiousness as temerity. Zhirinovskiy is not the cause, 
but the effect. The West is deceiving itself. It talks about 
partnership, but what kind of partnership can it be if one 
partner sets the conditions and blackmails the other? 
  [Janyska] What will Poland do if the summit in Brussels 
really does end ambiguously? 
  [Walesa] We will not ease up on the pressure that we will 
want to continue to exert within the framework of the Visegrad 
Group. We are not interested in who is first or second. 
Today's partners have to understand each other better. Those 
who do not want to play together will be left out. We will 
begin to consider other, more realistic forms. These will not 
be confrontational, because we are concerned about the security 
of everyone. We want the joint lungs of Europe, western and 
eastern, as the Holy Father once said, to learn to breath 
together for the sake of the whole organism. 
  [Janyska] Are we to understand, for example, that you are 
referring to the Western European Union under the concept of 
"more realistic forms"? 
  [Walesa] Yes, it too. We will be affiliated to it in 
February. 
  In short: We will have all our irons in the fire. Western 
Europe will have to expand toward the East sooner or later; it 
has no other choice. It will again be faced with the question 
of what to do with us. 
  What was it that Clinton did recently? His country could not 
develop further internally, it was afflicted by economic 
decline, overproduction, and unemployment. So, he decided to 
increase his options and NAFTA [North American Free Trade 
Association] was born. 
  Western Europe, however, is afraid of such a bold step. It 
acts like an old man shut away in a magnificent room until a 
young man bursts in and describes how beautiful it is outside 
and says he will open the window. The old man does not want 
this; apparently, he will catch cold. The young man tries to 
make him change his mind, telling him it will be good for him, 
but the old man does not believe this. 
  It is not that we would be better off than the West, but we 
have the upper hand as far as the internal vital strength of our 
people is concerned. 
  [Janyska] You said recently that the current situation 
reminds you of 1939 and the occupation.... 
  [Walesa] Yes. At that time, Poland said that is was not 
fighting for Gdansk, but for the whole of Europe; however, no 
one wanted to believe us. During the War, we spoke about the 
Gulag, about Katyn, about the fact that Poland has already been 
wiped off some maps, but the West did not want to hear about 
this. Hitlerism and Stalinism were just as bloody, but each of 
them was treated differently. A war was waged against one, 
while wine and coffee were drunk with the other and negotiations 
were held -- all of this was done by politicians considered to 
be heroes. We struggled for years to free ourselves from such a 
situation and we do not want history to be repeated. 
  [Janyska] The West often says that if it lets the Central 
European countries into NATO, how can it refuse other countries 
later? Why let in Warsaw and not Vilnius? 
  [Walesa] This is a matter of clear political and economic 
criteria. I have outlined the following scenario many times: 
The Visegrad Group will join NATO first, then the Baltic 
republics, and then -- according to their level of readiness -- 
Ukraine, Belarus, Romania, or Bulgaria.... Thus, the Western 
way of thinking and Western technology would make their way 
slowly toward the East, right up to Russia. 
  The Western concept that wants to invest in Russia directly 
may only lead to Russian neoimperialism. 
  [Janyska] The NATO countries often claim that we are under 
no dire threat and that, if it bothers Russia so much, we should 
not press the Alliance for entry. What do you think? Is Poland 
afraid of Russia? 
  [Walesa] It looks as though Western Europe and the United 
States are making concessions to Russia, and I do not like this. 
If it continues like this, perhaps we will have to negotiate 
with Yeltsin about entry into NATO and not with Clinton. 
  We are not afraid of Russia. If Moscow were to adopt a 
harder line, we would just be a tiny morsel for it. The things 
they do not have -- wealth, state-of-the-art technology -- would 
have to be sought in Western Europe. We would not be enough for 
them. This is what Western Europe should be afraid of. 
  We want to join NATO mainly in order to eliminate the 
malignancy that can feed off nationalism and the various demons 
of the past. We do not want anyone to die for us. After all, 
our membership in NATO would provide a political guarantee that 
nothing like this will ever be required in Central Europe. It 
will provide an assurance for the foreign capital coming into 
our country that it will be calm here and that -- for instance 
-- Russia will not invade. Reference is often made to the 
hostility between Greece and Turkey, but NATO is a guarantee 
that neither of the two sides can "stir up" too much trouble. 
  [Janyska] How did you manage to obtain a written statement 
from Yeltsin in August that Moscow will not object to Poland's 
membership in NATO? 
  [Walesa] Simple: By the force of our arguments. 
  It is in the interests of the new, democratic Russia to have 
equal partners with whom it could cooperate. Only an imperial 
Russia would require an ambiguous sphere of influence, I said 
and asked: Do you want to be a democratic country or an empire? 
In view of the fact that the answer was a democratic country, I 
continued: In this case, let us reduce the size of the region 
of insecurity that always threatens conflicts. This argument 
convinced Yeltsin, as it did Grachev and Kozyrev the next day. 
The democratic part of the delegation understood that this was 
a chance for the whole of democratic Russia. 
  We consider Yeltsin's signature on this document to be 
valid. 
No one has written to us from Russia telling us that we should 
annul it. 
  [Janyska] How do you explain the later shift in Russia's 
position? 
  [Walesa] Simple. Lenin said to his soldiers: Push until 
you meet with resistance, then withdraw. Yeltsin has realized 
that the West is not putting up any resistance to him, that it 
is succumbing to his diktat. He would not be a politician if he 
did not do what he is doing now. 
  We maintain that NATO would come close to Russia's borders 
not as an anti-Russian alliance, but as a zone of stability. It 
evolved as a defense mechanism against the eastern bloc and the 
Soviet Union. The USSR and the Warsaw Pact no longer exist, so 
why all the fear? Does today's Russia consider itself to be 
their heir and successor and does it see NATO as an 
unequivocally hostile institution? 
  [Janyska] At the beginning of the interview you said that 
you favor a joint course of action by the Central European 
states. In your opinion, why is this important? 
  [Walesa] As the Visegrad Group we have a population of more 
than 60 million. The word of such a group carries weight. We 
are too small on our own, as individual states. 
  Moreover, Europe demands a willingness for consensus and 
dialogue and it demands that we do not assert exorbitant 
demands. We have learned this in Visegrad. In a quartet, 
however, if just one person sings out of tune, the melody is no 
longer pure.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Lech Walesa by Grzegorz Miecugow; </F>
place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Miecugow] In connection with the NATO stance 
and the final shape of the Partnership for Peace, do you have a 
feeling of defeat? 
  [Walesa] No, I think that my actions have yielded some 
results because I think the outcome could have been even worse. 
However, I want to say that in my opinion we could have 
achieved more. In my opinion we could have gone further, but 
the great powers of this world have decided otherwise and we 
have to conform to this. 
  [Miecugow] Do you mean that although more could have been 
achieved, the current situation is no fault of ours? 
  [Walesa] There is no fault on our part, because this was 
beyond our reach. I did all I could to make this step somewhat 
longer. As a practicing politician, I believe that European 
geography should be changed, that European direction and 
development should be prejudged now, that uncertainties should 
be confronted with visions and concepts. This would be a better 
way of dealing with things. Why bet on the unknown? 
  If European geography expands, it would become clear that a 
zone of uncertainty is becoming smaller. But as I have said -- 
this was not to be. We will have to do much more. We will have 
to work more, and we will reach the same objective but much more 
slowly, not by leaps but by crawling. 
  [Miecugow] Have you got a plan for further actions? How do 
you want to lead Poland to NATO? 
  [Walesa] I think that after what I and we have done, the 
pressure by nations will be greater. I believe that at the same 
time we will have to go back to the past and speak about 
international agreements, that they have their consequences. We 
did not do this after the year 1939 and this is bad because you 
forget about these things today. You tend to remember our 
agreements, even the financial ones. Some even have grievances 
against us, saying that we are not a solid partner. But I want 
to say that those partners were not honest toward us; we also 
counted on a different course of events in 1939, but agreements 
were broken, commitments were not met, and these are just 
consequences. 
  You have to talk about this, because on an international 
scale greater morality is required as far as all these 
commitments are concerned. If we fail to do this, then there 
will continue to exist temptations to break or to depart from 
great agreements. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by M.W.: "Imposed Partnership"] </F>
  [Text] "The Partnership for Peace" program thrust upon 
Poland does not satisfy it," declared President Walesa on the 
eve of his meetings with U.S. President Bill Clinton and the 
leaders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary in Prague 
on 12 January. 
  Asked if Poland seeks full membership in NATO or only its 
security guarantees, the president said that "paper guarantees" 
are good for nothing. An authentic security guarantee would be 
Poland's integration into European structures, including NATO. 
Walesa thinks that his meeting with the U.S. President will be 
"difficult" because Clinton will probably defend his program, 
which is kind of imposed on us. 
  President Walesa will fly to Prague at 0615 GMT on 12 
January, while Prime Minister Pawlak departs 45 minutes before 
the president. That same day in the evening, also separately, 
both politicians will return to Warsaw. According to the 
Belvedere and the URM [Council of Ministers Administration], the 
top state officials cannot travel together. The president and 
prime minister will be accompanied by Foreign Minister Andrzej 
Olechowski, who is already in Prague to prepare the meeting with 
Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. The 
Polish delegation will first meet with Czech officials, and then 
with the Americans. 
  During his meeting with Edward Moskal, chairman of the 
Congress of Polish Americans, Deputy Prime Minister Aleksander 
Luczak thanked him for the support extended by that organization 
for Poland's seeking full NATO membership.

<F P=106> [Report by Malgorzata Subotic: "Too Small a Step in the </F>
Right Direction"] 
  [Text] President Lech Walesa and the Pawlak government see 
eye to eye on statements by President Clinton in Brussels: "This 
is too small a step in the right direction." No one has ever 
questioned Walesa's visit to the summit in Prague. Poland will 
never seek any other defense unions, including bilateral ones. 
This information was conveyed to journalists by Polish Foreign 
Minister Andrzej Olechowski following the Cabinet of Ministers 
meeting on 10 January, attended by Walesa and legislators 
responsible for foreign policy issues. The president left the 
government building without making any comments to the press. 
  The Council of Ministers instructed the prime minister to 
accept the "Partnership for Peace" initiative; however, the 
final decision will not be adopted until all relevant documents 
are made public. The ministers of defense and foreign affairs 
will conduct a thorough analysis of those documents. In the 
opinion of Andrzej Olechowski, the Polish Government described 
Clinton's recent statements, including the affirmation of U.S. 
presence in Europe, NATO openness for new members (as a result 
of evolution), "Partnership for Peace," and the definition of 
new relations between the West European Union and NATO, as too 
small a step in the right direction. Walesa said that "if you 
make too small a step over the creek, you might fall into it." 
  Polish politicians believe that Western proposals for 
admitting new members to NATO lack a timetable and conditions 
for admission. At the same time, they emphasize that Poland's 
strategic goal is NATO membership. Minister Olechowski said 
that it is better to be in the waiting room than to wait 
outside. While the doors to NATO have been closed until 
recently, the minister thinks that we have now found ourselves 
in the waiting room. Meeting with journalists, Olechowski 
equated the situation to "engagement with a girl who agreed 
yesterday to marry us" but didn't say when. He also disagreed 
with journalists who said Poland stands no chance of being 
admitted to the bloc. 
  Asked about the Visegrad Group summit beginning today in 
Prague, the minister stressed that the stance of its members on 
the NATO issue is almost identical. "The differences can be 
compared to those between synonymous words." The Polish 
minister is optimistic about the readiness of our country to 
participate in NATO: "In terms of democracy and the development 
of the military industry, Poland is by no means worse off than 
Greece was at the time of its admission to the bloc. We should 
be among the first countries to be admitted."

<F P=106> [Interview with Polish Union of the Democratic Left Chairman </F>
Aleksander Kwasniewski by Pavol Minarik in Warsaw; date not 
given: "Can the Left Establish Capitalism?"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Minarik] What is your view 
on cooperation among the Visegrad Four countries? 
  [Kwasniewski] I am convinced that mutual cooperation will 
not weaken our countries, but will enhance their domestic and 
international status. Therefore, I do not consider the course 
of action being followed by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, who is 
trying to incorporate Bohemia into a united Europe behind the 
backs of the Visegrad Group, to be a very fortunate one. I 
think our position will be better if we proceed together. A 
race to see who will be first, for example, in the European 
Union, will not speed up this incorporation process, rather it 
will slow it down. Apart from this, I think it would be 
beneficial to intensify economic cooperation in the region, for 
example, by establishing free trade zones or by adopting a joint 
course of action to acquire or restore markets, first and 
foremost, in the East. 
  [Minarik] Developing a security system in Central Europe 
should also be one of the main areas of cooperation among the 
Visegrad Four. 
  [Kwasniewski] I am absolutely in favor of us coordinating 
our steps for entry into security structures, including NATO, 
because we all face the same problems. First and foremost, we 
have to convince the West to open up to us, but, on the other 
hand, we cannot turn our relations with Russia and Ukraine into 
antagonistic ones. 
  [Minarik] Are you worried by the victory of [Liberal 
Democratic Party] V. Zhirinovskiy in the Russian elections, 
especially by his controversial statements about Poland? 
  [Kwasniewski] Zhirinovskiy's victory was remarkable, but the 
question still is what kind of influence will he have in Russia. 
The fundamental issue is how will the man who wields real power 
in the country behave, that is, Boris Yeltsin, who is 
responsible for the new constitution. It is crucial whether he 
embarks upon a policy of strengthening the democratic processes 
and becoming involved in security systems or whether 
Zhirinovskiy will scare him and he embarks upon a policy of 
nationalism and restoring power-wielding whims. I think, 
however, that Boris Yeltsin realizes that Russia needs to 
cooperate with the West and Europe and that he will also direct 
his steps toward this end. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Slawomir Matczak, including </F>
recorded remarks by Marek Borowski, deputy prime minister and 
finance minister; from the "Panorama" program -- relayed by 
Warsaw TV Polonia Network] 
  [Text] [Matczak] The Ministry of Finance has not envisaged 
expenditures connected with the Partnership for Peace program in 
the budget that has been prepared. 
  [Borowski] So the question of whether we could afford it has 
to be examined closely, and I think that the minister of 
national defense should have his say too, or maybe first of all, 
as he has a particular budget at his disposal. 
  [Matczak] All expenses for possible joint military 
operations 
will be borne by the Ministry of National Defense. The Ministry 
of Finance counts, however, on financial support by western 
partners for peace as Poland recently suffered considerable 
losses, especially in the arms industry. This was connected 
with the collapse of the eastern market and with UN embargo. 
The partnership can become an important step not in military 
cooperation alone. 
  [Borowski] As the partnership does not give certain 
political 
guarantees, it may bring some economic benefits.

  [Excerpts] The Sejm debate on the government draft budget 
has revealed that both in the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and in 
the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] there are groups of deputies 
critical of actions being taken by Waldemar Pawlak's cabinet. 
If the commissions do not propose increased expenditure on 
agriculture and social welfare, 30 to 40 coalition deputies are 
prepared to vote against the budget. The coalition has, 
however, such a majority in the parliament that even a loss of a 
double this number of votes cannot undermine the government. 
  [Correspondent] The most dissatisfied are some National 
Trade 
Union Alliance [OPZZ] deputies, whose leader in the SLD 
parliamentary floor group is Stanislaw Wisniewski. Deputy 
Wisniewski is of the opinion that, if during work on the budget 
it is not possible to increase funding for social welfare, 
active combatting of unemployment, and restructuring of the most 
threatened regions, the OPZZ should vote against the budget. 
[passage omitted] 
  In the PSL, a group of about 20 deputies from the 
[organization of] agricultural circles is the most critical of 
the draft budget. The board [of the organization] instructed its 
parliamentarians to vote against the government if the funding 
for agriculture is not increased from 2 billion to 6 billion 
zlotys. Some PSL activists are of the opinion that the SLD 
coalition members want to discriminate against agriculture.

  [Text] Warsaw, 10 Jan (PAP) -- Two hundred and forty-nine 
railway transit journeys of Russian Federation troops (3,627 
cars) passed through Poland from Germany (?to Russia in the 
fourth quarter) of last year. This accounted for 71 percent of 
all transport planned for that period, according to Major 
General Zdzislaw Ostrowski, the Polish Republic Government 
plenipotentiary for the stationing of Russian Federation troops 
in Poland. Transport operations were also carried out by air: 
During the same period 198 aircraft flew from Germany to Russia 
and 281 from Russia to Germany. The Russian military mission 
submitted reports on 83 railway transit journeys for January. 
During the Russian troops' transit operations no incidents, 
accidents or "other events interfering with the transit process 
or public order" were noted, the plenipotentiary's statement 
notes.

<F P=106> [Interview with the Polish Ownership Transformations </F>
Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek by Aleksander Geryn on the "Balance 
-- Governmental Magazine" program; place and date not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Geryn] Your colleagues from 
the Council of Ministers are counting very much on this revenue 
from privatization. They think that with this revenue, they 
will be able to close some gaps in the budget. 
  [Kaczmarek] I think that generally speaking, this is one of 
the dilemmas of privatization in Poland: To what extent the 
mechanism of selling state-owned property -- and I would like to 
stress that I think state-owned property can only be sold once 
since we do not plan on nationalization -- is supposed to 
constitute a mechanism of a kind of safety cushion for public 
finance problems. Poland is undergoing some quite significant 
and major reforms and they are accompanied by disturbances in 
some sectors of public finances under some of my minister 
colleagues, so on the one hand they are critical of 
privatization, but on the other hand they expect precisely their 
expenditures to be financed by revenue from privatization. That 
of course reminds me of the philosophy of applying a band-aid to 
some of the wounds in the budget, whereas I am more interested 
in revenue from privatization serving the purpose of 
restructuring companies or branches that the state may regard as 
strategic, within its industrial or economic policy, so we would 
not eat our own tail. 
  [Geryn] Up to now, privatization has been and still 
continues to be criticized. Some even say outrightly that the 
concept is an implementation of a liberal dogma and that since 
half of our economy has been privatized, these processes should 
be slowed down a bit. Do you think that Poland can currently 
afford to slow down the rate of privatization? 
  [Kaczmarek] This will always continue to be a dilemma and I 
think the Sejm debate which is ahead of us concerning the 
directions of privatization will be a debate where I hope some 
-- and I will encourage them to do so -- will speak about what 
needs to be done in the future, whereas some others will 
stubbornly stick to the past from which I personally would like 
to draw conclusions. I think there will also be some 
disappointments in this regard, either by various reviewers or 
by sensation-seekers, in the sense that there can be no radical 
change in the directions of privatization, and the simple reason 
for that is that we are just learning ownership transformations, 
that is privatization. What goal should privatization serve in 
Poland? Should it be financing the budget deficit, improving 
the efficiency of the Polish economy, extending ownership rights 
to large parts of society, or should it serve primarily to 
exclusively concentrate those mechanisms which serve to improve 
the economic efficiency, to increase competitiveness, and 
consequently to increase prosperity? One should also keep in 
mind another issue: Ownership transformations should not only 
be understood to mean a transfer of state-owned property to the 
private sector, but also as a process of creating the right 
conditions for the functioning of the private sector from the 
very beginning, from scratch. And as I have also recently been 
saying repeatedly, privatization is also a system and a process 
of transferring power, and that is certainly the reason it 
generates so many conflicts. 
  [Geryn] Mr. Minister, forgive me this analogy but if I were 
to close my eyes now while listening to you, I would have a 
feeling of listening not to Minister Kaczmarek but to [former 
Ownership Transformations] Minister Lewandowski. 
  [Kaczmarek] It is hard to describe some economic processes 
using words other than these since these processes are simply 
constant and always the same. All we can do is draw some 
conclusions from the past and I think one could probably compile 
quite a long list of such conclusions with regard to which there 
would have to be changes in the current draft. As the 
government, we intend to present in the draft some material to 
the Sejm where emphases will be placed in different ways, with 
regard to Polish privatization, with particular emphasis 
continuing to be placed on developing the capital market, 
increasing competitiveness, as well as on preference being 
primarily given to restructuring, followed by the selling of 
companies, and on improving the access of employee partnerships 
to small companies, including performing the role of owner. But 
there is immediately another dilemma here: Can Poland as a 
state administration currently afford to manage 6,000 
state-owned enterprises? I think the answer is no. 
  [Geryn] Will we finally see a law on reprivatization this 
year? The issue has been dragging on for four years now. 
Everybody knows that there can be no progress in privatization 
without reprivatization. 
  [Kaczmarek] The issue is included on the list of priorities 
when it comes to the directions of privatization for 1994. We 
have to approach the issue of the scale of reprivatization from 
a perspective of two issues, if I could phrase it this way: The 
first one is the state's financial capabilities -- which means 
it cannot be a process which would lead to a weakening of the 
state budget whose condition is quite weak anyway; and the other 
one is that we will also be guided by the principle that up to 
now a law was in force -- it could have been a bad law but it 
was still a law -- and so we will implement reprivatization in 
cases where somebody's property was nationalized illegally, 
without paying compensation, and so on and so forth. We will 
try to observe these principles, or at least such is the 
conclusion drawn from initial debates during sessions of the 
Council of Ministers.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ewa Spychalska, National Trade Union Accord </F>
(OPZZ) chairperson, by correspondent Teresa Kwasniewska; place 
and date not given] 
  [Text] [Kwasniewska] Rumor has it that the government is 
currently lagging behind the National Trade Union Accord [OPZZ] 
-- at least that is what Prime Minister Pawlak has alleged.... 
  [Spychalska] We can no longer hold back and wait for the 
government. There are certain issues which need to be sorted 
out now, without delay. We all know that the situation is 
difficult; the previous government did not conceal that, either. 
After all, as we prepared for the projected economic 
transformations, we were all hoping (along with representatives 
of the state's executive powers) that that state of affairs 
could be reversed reasonably quickly. However, there still have 
been no proposal to set up a group of competent people to 
analyze what should be changed and how it should be done. 
Meanwhile, people are getting impatient and disappointed. 
After all, this is not what they chose the new authorities for 
-- but no obvious changes are forthcoming, and it does not look 
as if they were forthcoming in any foreseeable future. 
  [Kwasniewska] But you seem to have little power or influence 
to change the course of events, do you not? After all, price 
rises are being introduced regardless of whether you approve of 
them or not. 
  [Spychalska] Some price rises are the effect of the last 
budget, and that was drafted and approved by the old Sejm. 
Others are the consequence of the switch to the free market 
economy. After all, no one wants or expects to see a return to 
the old system of central steering of the economy. 
  [Kwasniewska] What about the social contract which you were 
proposing? 
  [Spychalska] That concept was announced by Premier Pawlak, 
but to date the government has not come up with any proposals 
for such a social contract. That is why we are suggesting our 
own theses and proposals. 
  [Kwasniewska] Has there been much interest in your proposals 
on the government's part? 
  [Spychalska] The government showed so much interest in them 
that we were forced to make our proposals available to it while 
they were still being drafted and perfected by the relevant 
working party. That was because it turned out that the 
government had no specific concept of how to work out such a 
contract in the first place.... 
  [Kwasniewska] What elements should be included in the social 
contract you have in mind? 
  [Spychalska] Generally speaking, such a contract should map 
out the principles of our social and economic policy that should 
see us through the next four years. It should also give a more 
detailed outline of that policy for the approaching year. Even 
more specifically, it should include proposals on how to 
galvanize the economy, which directions of foreign economic 
cooperation should be adopted, how to create opportunities for 
expanding the market, and which products to concentrate on. 
Also, how to halt the spread of unemployment, and how to find 
the best methods to create new jobs. The social contract should 
specify the extent of proposed investment outlays, the 
principles of our policy regarding state enterprises, and also 
the principles of our proposed pay and price policies. It is 
high time to begin talking about bringing our wages and our 
incomes into line with the free market rules. The abolition of 
the enterprises tax on above-normative pay ["popiwek"] does not 
solve any problems here. To date, there have been no talks with 
the government on the question of the value of labor in the 
finished product. And such talks should definitely take place 
soon. 
  [Kwasniewska] When do you think is such a social contract 
most likely to be signed? 
  [Spychalska] It would only make sense to sign it before the 
state budget is approved. That in turn should be ready for 
submission to a Sejm debate by the end of March or beginning of 
April. Thus, there is still plenty of time to negotiate its 
terms in talks with the government. 
  [Kwasniewska] But do you not preclude the possibility of 
testing the government's -- your own government's -- strength in 
a confrontation of forces? 
  [Spychalska] Regardless of whether or not there are own 
trade union representatives in the government, the government is 
a social consensus government, since it was appointed as a 
result of a democratic election. Apart from that, the 
government will always be just a side to negotiate with as far 
as the trade unions are concerned. And it is certain that we 
will often stand up against this government. 
  [Kwasniewska] The needs of the population increasingly 
exceed the government's ability to meet them.... 
  [Spychalska] We know about that. However, it is the 
government's brief to expand its ability to meet the needs of 
the population. It is high time indeed for the government to 
activate the mechanisms which can increase state budget revenues 
and not merely go on curtailing budget expenditure. 
  [Kwasniewska] Will Solidarity take part in your negotiations 
with the government? 
  [Spychalska] We have had no response to the public 
invitation which we extended to Solidarity to engage in joint 
work with us. However, we will yet again approach our colleagues 
from other trade unions. After all, the stronger and better 
represented the union side, the better guarantees we will have 
to obtain some satisfactory results -- such as the decent 
minimum wages in the "Social Welfare Guarantees Charter." 
  [Kwasniewska] The "popiwek" tax is scheduled to be abolished 
on 31 March, but the men at the helm of our economy are still 
nursing many anxieties about it.... 
  [Spychalska] Their fears are unjustified. As a result of 
restructuring, today many enterprises are able to reduce 
employment in the interest of paying higher wages to their 
remaining work force, who are thus more efficiently employed. 
However, they often give up this chance during the transition 
period, in the situation where the government is unable to 
guarantee work for everyone. They keep many of their employees 
on, thus giving them a chance to continue earning money and 
avert the specter of becoming dependent on unemployment benefit. 
Such gestures are very noble. But this state of affairs cannot 
last very long. 
  Nor does the government have to worry that the entire profit 
will be absorbed by the wages. Today every employed person 
knows that unless a proportion of the company profit is invested 
in development and modernization, there will be no job for him 
-- or for anyone else in the company -- to count on in the long 
run. 
  [Kwasniewska] Will the OPZZ not encourage people to strike? 
  [Spychalska] If we manage to negotiate an agreement with the 
government that will offer us sufficient hope that the situation 
will improve, we will obviously be obliged to promote attitudes 
of calm among the population, to talk to people, and to persuade 
them that it is well worth remaining patient. If the public has 
even the slightest evidence of some tangible improvement in 
their situation, we can ask them for still more patience. On 
the other hand, I see no chance of calming the public if nothing 
is seen to be improving....

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] "Poland is becoming the best place for 
distributing narcotics to West Europe, a money-laundering 
station, and an area for hiding narcotic wares," reports the 19 
December issue of the Poznan weekly WPROST. Adam Szyszko, chief 
of the Second Department of the National Interpol Bureau, told 
the Poznan weekly that since the outbreak of war in the former 
Yugoslavia, which was the "traditional country that acted as a 
transit point for drugs to West Europe, the `Polish idea' has 
attracted drug gangs." Interpol is said to believe that the 
equivalent of millions of dollars of narcotics-tainted money is 
in Polish banks. 
  Since 1990, Poland has become a "transit port" for 
narcotics. 
WPROST says that Colombian cocaine and West African hashish and 
marijuana make their way to either the ports of Szczecin and 
Gdynia or to Warsaw's Okecie airport, from which they are 
shipped to France, Germany, and Great Britain. Figures on 
customs seizures indicate that Okecie airport is being used more 
often than it had been in the past. On 1 December, for example, 
the Polish Customs Service seized a half-ton of marijuana that 
had arrived on a KLM flight from Lagos, Nigeria, marked as fish. 
"Just the fact that the shipment was from Nigeria caused 
suspicion because we do not import fish from that region into 
Poland," said one official. 
  Interpol's Szyszko says that the couriers are often 
protected 
by diplomatic immunity, which "seriously complicates the 
situation." The ambassador of Costa Rica himself was caught at 
Okecie airport with 12 kg of heroin in his baggage. 
  One of the most ingenious plans was devised by German 
smugglers. As Mr. Szyszko describes it, large parcels of 
narcotics were to be sent to Poland, where they would be 
repackaged, receive new papers, and be sent on their way to 
Hamburg to cover up the sources of the drugs. 
  WPROST points out that the efforts of Polish Customs 
officials to suppress the drug trade are hampered by Polish law, 
which does not make mere possession and consumption of drugs a 
crime. New banking laws have been enacted to prevent the use of 
Polish banks for drug-money-laundering schemes, but there are 
still loopholes that permit such schemes to flourish. 
  Wprost states that the involvement of international 
organized 
crime has further complicated enforcement efforts. According to 
Szyszko, these groups are far better organized and technically 
skilled than are Polish criminal groups. According to another 
official, both the Italian Mafia and the Colombian Cali cartel 
are involved in drug smuggling through Poland, with the Cali 
cartel reportedly using Polish couriers to smuggle narcotics 
over the Polish-German border." WPROST reports that police 
consider the production and smuggling of amphetamines to be one 
of the most dangerous recent developments. In the first quarter 
of 1993, seven and a half tons of these synthetic drugs were 
confiscated. Szyszko says that foreign money, principally from 
the United States, is funding Polish amphetamine production. 
  The 28 December Warsaw daily ZYCIE WARSZAWY reports that 
special police units have been formed to fight organized crime. 
These units, which will be several-hundred-policemen strong and 
will be under the direction of a Bureau for Fighting Organized 
Crime, were scheduled to become operational on 1 January. The 
bureau's work will be classified at the top secret level. It 
already has 26 domestic and foreign groups operating on Polish 
territory as its targets. Departments of the bureau will be 
opened in Krakow, Katowice, Wroclaw, Szczecin, Lodz, Gdansk, 
Poznan, Lublin, Bialystok, Olsztyn, and Bydgoszcz.

  [Text] The Muslim-led Bosnian Government intends to ask 
friendly countries to boycott Western products if NATO does not 
decide to intervene militarily in Bosnia in the near future. The 
Bosnian ambassador to the United Nations, Muhamed Secirbegovic, 
announcing the planned boycott request on Dutch television, said 
it would go out mainly to Muslim countries. Mr. Secirbegovic 
said that the Bosnian Muslims feel betrayed by Western countries 
that make pledges but fail to translate them into action. The 
Bosnian ambassador said the international boycott must be 
directed against countries that obstruct military intervention.

  [Text] The session of the People's Assembly of the Srpska 
republic ended last night with a discussion behind closed doors 
on the peace negotiations in Geneva and Brussels. The deputies 
did not study possible corrections to the present platform as 
the political basis of the Serbian negotiating team. It was 
decided not to change anything in the essence of the political 
stands presently contained in the platform. The final decision 
regarding the platform will be made at the next assembly session 
in Bijeljina on 17 January, one day before the talks in Geneva.

  [Text] Yasushi Akashi, special envoy of the UN Secretary 
General to former Yugoslavia, paid a two-day visit to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, during which he met with representatives of 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina authorities as well as with the Serbian 
aggressor's side. Yasushi Akashi spoke in more detail about the 
results of these talks at a news conference that he held in 
Sarajevo this evening. Zoran Pirolic reports: 
  [Begin Pirolic recording] During a two-day visit in 
Sarajevo, Yasushi Akashi met with the representatives of our 
country's authorities, but also of the aggressor' side in Pale. 
His impression after these talks put forward in Sarajevo 
tonight is definitely interesting. 
  I was given assurances by both sides that they favor peace 
and unhindered movement of humanitarian convoys, Akashi said. 
This afternoon I was given firm assurances by Mr. Karadzic that 
his side will fully observe the free use of Sarajevo airport. 
He reiterated his devotion to the free movement of convoys, Mr. 
Akashi added. This UN representative said that he had heard from 
both sides -- the Bosnian authorities and the aggressor's side 
-- that they favor multiethnic and multicultural life although 
they differ a little in their views on the implementation of 
this. After these, definitely unusual assessments, the UN 
special envoy to former Yugoslavia was exposed to a real barrage 
of often very unpleasant questions. 
  First of all, he was asked whether he believed Karadzic's 
promises even though they had been made on numerous occasions 
before and as a matter of rule subsequently broken. According to 
Akashi, the entire problem lies in the line of command. Dr. 
Karadzic admitted to him that the resolutions and declarations 
had not been observed so far because of disobedient soldiers on 
the ground, but that the line of command would be strengthen and 
similar things would no longer recur. 
  Asked about the possibility of air strikes against the 
Serbian aggressor, Mr. Akashi was at first surprised and then 
asked what air strikes were. It seems that there is a great 
confusion between air strikes and what we, in the UN, call air 
support, Akashi said. The forces on the ground will resort to 
this sort of protection only in the case of self-defense, Akashi 
added. 
  Answering to a question whether the recent murderous 
shelling 
of Sarajevo, which lasted several days, was also one of the 
incidents by disobedient soldiers, Akashi replied that elements 
beyond control exist on all sides. He admitted that four UN 
Protection Force experts confirmed that Karadzic's Serbs had 
damaged the runway of Sarajevo airport, but added that he was 
given firm assurances that this side would not obstruct the flow 
of humanitarian aid. 
  Asked about the possibility of a military intervention in 
Bosnia, Akashi said that this was a highly serious issue and 
that the final decision on this will be passed by the UN 
Security Council. However, I hope that we will never reach the 
stage of passing a decision about a military intervention, he 
said. 
  Asked to explain what is a close air support and how does it 
differ from air strikes, Mr. Akashi said that the final decision 
about this action lies in the hands of the UN Secretary General 
and that it will be based on the assessments of the commanders 
of the peace troops on the ground. The blue berets had, on 
several occasions, drilled such an action, Akasi said, adding 
that he hoped that there would be no need for its application. 
  General Francis Briquemont, commander of the UN peace troops 
for Bosnia-Herzegovina, also attended the news conference. 
Asked whether he had proposed air strikes he replied: I have 
never uttered a word about air strikes or air support, never. I 
said in August what I thought about this. The air support was 
organized but I never demanded it. I am the only one who can 
demand air protection, but I have never done this. I am not 
upset by what is being said about this in New York, Paris, 
Brussels, and Geneva. I have enough problems in Bosnia, General 
Briquemont concluded. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Nikola Koljevic, vice president of the </F>
republic of Srpska, by Slobodan Kovacevic in Pale on 10 January 
-- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Kovacevic] We shall now be talking to Nikola 
Koljevic, vice president of the Serbian Republic. Like 
President Radovan Karadzic, he has had a strenuous day today, a 
day without a break. 
  Professor Koljevic, you did not even have time for a break. 
You are waiting to join the deputies in the assembly hall any 
minute now. We should clarify a couple of things first. We are 
interested in new details regarding the talks with the UN 
special envoy Akashi. We informed the listeners of Belgrade 
Radio in the main newscast that all problems, misunderstandings, 
all Muslims' tricks about his arrival in Sarajevo were clarified 
at the very beginning of the meeting. 
  [Koljevic] Yes, this moment is exceptionally dramatic, 
especially regarding foreign affairs. I think that it would not 
be an exaggeration to say that we are indeed dealing with war 
and peace, with the issue of war and peace. How important Mr. 
Akashi's visit is is evident from several details. He landed 
yesterday, not at Sarajevo airport, but at another place, 
because he was prevented. The airport runway was damaged by a 
Muslim shell. Despite this he came here. You see that he 
considered this very important. Second, he has assumed an 
extremely important role in relieving Mr. Stoltenberg of the 
burden of civilian matters in this sector of the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Third, he arrived in Pale today and brought 
us a very encouraging piece of news, namely that UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Force] is currently engaged in civilian 
administration to a significantly greater degree, at least in 
the Sarajevo region. Therefore, the military option is further 
and further away. It is increasingly more a matter of 
individual irresponsible politicians from, I would say, Europe. 
Regarding the United Nations, we were today given firm 
guarantees that there will be no military interference, military 
intervention without their permission, that they are not in 
favor of it at all, and that they expect a peace agreement. 
  Finally, he also brought us news from Bonn that the talks 
between [Bosnian President] Izetbegovic and [Croatian President] 
Tudjman continued, that they had a long dispute about central 
Bosnia last night, about the enclaves of Travnik, Vitez, and the 
Lasva valley, that these differences have probably been overcome 
today, and that some progress has been made in Bonn. 
  Regarding the Serbian side, we gave him guarantees that we 
are ready to sign peace, that we will adopt a platform on that 
today, that under certain conditions we are ready to place some 
communes of former Sarajevo, excluding Pale, under UN 
administration. Therefore, things are moving in a positive 
direction, although they do not look all that great in reality. 
As you know, there has been some heavy fighting, some strong 
attacks, especially on Grbavica in Sarajevo and fierce clashes 
in central Bosnia. [passage omitted] 
  [Kovacevic] Professor Koljevic, can you give us some other 
details. How successful were the talks that were conducted 
during the first visit by the new UN coordinator Akashi? 
  [Koljevic] Relatively speaking -- everything is relative and 
can only be compared with what happened in the past -- the talks 
were exceptionally successful. We received the news today from 
the Croatian media and from Bonn that there is a possibility of 
a Muslim-Croatian union being created. We are not opposed to 
this at all, because we consider this to be a democratic right 
of both the Croatian and the Muslim peoples. Of course, we 
retain the right for the Serbian people to democratically decide 
in what way they want to be linked with these two republics of 
the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  We here even considered a wider, more global approach. We 
considered offering to the European Union a possibility of 
creating a confederation on the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia, in which all individual regions that have separated 
themselves could freely and democratically chose the way they 
want to participate in an association or a confederation of 
Yugoslav states. 
  Therefore, everyone would be able to decide democratically 
whether he wants a monetary union, or only a customs union, 
whether he wants firm federal links. This would be a completely 
democratic solution in line with the current European trend of 
integration of certain regions and, of course, their free choice 
regarding their political sovereignty. [passage omitted] 
  [Kovacevic] As we said, in about half an hour you will join 
the deputies in the assembly hall to discuss the platform for 
the continuation of the Geneva talks. You resolutely said that 
if there is no real wish for peace, if the so-called Geneva 
peace remained here in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, nothing 
will come of Geneva. 
  [Koljevic] We think that we should decidedly demonstrate to 
Europe, which saw how much we favor peace, that we want peace, 
if such peace can be established. If peace cannot be 
established, we can no longer fool our own people. The Serbs 
will not agree to the further procrastination of a solution. 
The Serbs can decide to fight to the end, but would much prefer 
an end to the fighting. However, people are not prepared for a 
third alternative, as could have been seen in the assembly today. 
  I think that a platform will be adopted today, although it 
is 
difficult to predict things. I think that it will be peaceful 
and constructive. I think that demands set to us so far will 
also be discussed. I hope that under certain conditions the 
deputies will accept the postponement of the solution, that is, 
accept the UN protectorate in Sarajevo for two years at the 
most. Third, I think that a very important thing for us in the 
platform, after percentages, would be the make possible the 
exchange of quality for quantity, something we insisted on in 
the past. We think that other parties are also interested in 
it. Regarding other matters, it remains to be seen what will 
happen because the deputies will voting on them.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jovan Divjak, deputy chief of staff of the </F>
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, by Franjo Bosnic in Sarajevo; date not 
given: "The World Will Not Bring Us Peace"] 
  [Text] Once a lieutenant-colonel in the former JNA 
[Yugoslav People's Army] and presently deputy chief of staff of 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, Jovan Divjak is often both praised 
and disputed in Sarajevo. He was even arrested in Konjic once, 
suspected of selling ammunition to the Serbs. Our brief meeting 
in Sarajevo was used for this interview, and we first asked him 
to comment on conflicts between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and 
the HVO [Croatian Defense Council]. 
  [Divjak] It was difficult for members of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the HVO to engage in a conflict, 
which is a result of political desires to divide 
Bosnia-Herzegovina that fit into the longing for Greater Serbia 
and Greater Croatia. I have been in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 
and in the Supreme Headquarters from the very first day, and all 
the while, we have been trying to involve patriots in the 
defense of Bosnia-Herzegovina in its internationally recognized 
borders. Unfortunately, some estimated that Bosnia-Herzegovina 
should be divided on principles originating from Garasanin, on 
the Serbian side, and from World War II, on the Croatian side, 
not taking into consideration that all three nations have lived 
and will continue to live in these parts. It is true that the 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina became even more complex and 
that the attitude of Europe and the world toward it has changed 
since the conflict began between the extreme parts of the HVO 
and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. These conflicts have escalated 
to the point where former friends and allies who were fighting 
the common aggressor together are now perpetrating massacres 
against each other, killing women, children, old people, and 
burning each other's homes. Unfortunately, politics determined 
some relations that do not suit the nations of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The aggressor from the east is best at this 
game, the aggressor which began all this -- the fascist SDS 
[Serbian Democratic Party] and parts of the former JNA with 
extremists from Serbia and Montenegro. Joint goals of the HVO 
and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army in the beginning of the war are 
now distanced due to some territorial pretensions and divisions, 
due to the demand that a part of the territory be controlled by 
some kind of Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian (Muslim) republic, which 
is definitely not a referendum wish of the majority of people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Those conflicts will continue for a while, 
for neither the Geneva talks nor any other negotiations under 
the pressure of Europe and the world can produce any results. 
Conflicts will stop only when all three warring factions agree 
to sit together and have peace. That can happen in six months, 
in a year, or more, but conflicts will rage on until the world 
stops interfering. 
  [Bosnic] Tell us something about the Tuzla recipe for 
relations between the Croats and the Muslims in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Divjak] This is not only the case in Tuzla; fortunately, it 
is also alive in the Bosnian Sava Basin region and, to some 
extent, in Sarajevo. It is a recipe of how one should live in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Representatives of the Croats and Muslims 
on this territory have convinced us that they can and will live 
together. There is yet another fact -- a new-old initiative on 
the Bosnian nation is emerging. Many people spoke about the new 
national organization. That is not bad, but the Croats, 
Muslims, and the Serbs must not lose their national identity. 
  [Bosnic] As a soldier, what do you think about the Geneva 
talks? 
  [Divjak] This is an attempt to forcefully solve the problem 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina, former Yugoslavia, and the Balkans, and 
not according to the wishes of citizens and nations that have 
been living here for centuries, but according to the desire of 
the old lady Europe. Let me remind you that in February 1993, 
at the time when he was leaving his "throne," U.S. President 
Bush talked to Russian President Yeltsin about the division of 
interest spheres according to the Yalta agreement. Past 
relations in Europe, in the Balkans, and in former Yugoslavia 
mirror the relations between the United States and Russia. When 
Russia pulls, the United States pushes its allies and injects a 
couple of billion dollars into Russia. Even recently, the 
United States gave $2 billion to Russia. We know about the 
historic friendship of Russia and Serbia and that Serbia depends 
on Russia, and Russia is protecting the "endangered" Orthodox 
Church from Islam and Catholicism. History accepts the 
destruction of a nation, ethnic cleansing, and those who want 
integral Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the Croats and the Muslims -- 
will suffer. Ethnic cleansing in this war mostly affected the 
Muslims, but the Croats will not be spared either. 
  [Bosnic] Are you a Serb or an orthodox Bosnian? 
  [Divjak] I have always been a citizen of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
I have lived in Sarajevo for 28 years, and all the while, I feel 
that I am a citizen without losing my national identity. I have 
never accepted any nationalism and I never will. I am a citizen 
of Sarajevo, a citizen of Bosnia-Herzegovina, a Bosnian and a 
Herzegovinian. I feel like most honest people in these parts, 
if you will. Bosnia is my only country; I have no other. The 
Croats, the Muslims, loyal Serbs, all those who live in it, have 
the same right to my country. 
  [Bosnic] Is there anything you would like to say to the 
Croatian public? 
  [Divjak] Since this interview will reach the public in 
Croatia and parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina in which there are 
mostly Croats, I would like to clarify something. The Chetniks 
-- the Serbian side -- accused me of being a criminal of war and 
a traitor of the Serbs, while the Croats accused me of being a 
member of the JNA intelligence service, a communist, and a 
founding father of the Muslim army. In this war, I am fighting 
for the equality of the Croats, the Muslims, and those Serbs who 
fight in the Bosnia- Herzegovina Army and in the HVO. My 
intentions were never aimed toward any single nation in 
particular. Accusations that I advocated conflicts between the 
Croats and the Muslims are senseless; this is propaganda by 
those who are against integral Bosnia-Herzegovina in its 
borders. Even if it is divided under pressure, those who live 
here will arrange their relations as they have done for 
centuries. Present leaders of all three national parties in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will be forgotten, but Bosnia-Herzegovina 
will remain.

<F P=106> [Interview with Slavoljub Susic, Belgrade radio </F>
military-political commentator, by Milorad Denda; place not 
given -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Denda] Let us now turn to our basic topic -- 
the decisions of the NATO summit in Brussels, especially those 
decisions and announcements regarding the situation in Bosnia. 
We have asked Slavoljub Susic to comment on these decisions. 
  However, before saying anything, let us cite the Voice of 
America. VOA is claiming that some high-ranking U.S. officers 
expressed reserve toward possible air raids, despite the U.S. 
arsenal of accurately guided weapons and the probable lack of 
Serbian fighter aircraft that could intercept the allied 
bombers. The said officers, the radio says, assess that the 
Bosnian Serbs could easily hide heavy artillery weapons in 
woodlands or mountainous regions or transfer them to populated 
areas that pilots would hesitate to attack. One general 
compared this military action to that of searching for a needle 
in a haystack. Colleague Susic, these considerations in 
Washington are interesting, but one could say something about 
the respectable forces of the Srpska army when talking about 
antiaircraft defense. 
  [Susic] Well, yes. It sounds paradoxical, but it is a fact 
that during the last several years, particularly during the last 
year of President Bush's term of office and during the first 
year of President Clinton's term, it has been the politicians 
who have been more militant than the soldiers; it is the 
soldiers who warn about all the possible consequences of hasty 
decisions to set off into a military adventure, especially in 
the Balkans. I would also point out that the Srpska army 
possesses a respectable number of artillery-missile forces, 
which are not to be underestimated. After all, this is an army 
of a formed state community in which, whether one cares to admit 
it or not, organs of civilian power and the army as an 
institution are already functioning. 
  Apart from tactical-technical measures of antiaircraft 
defense and protection that the Srpska army would undertake in 
the event of an air raid, such as the scattered disposition of 
units, the frequent transfer of forces, engineering security and 
protection measures, the discipline of fire [discplina vatre], 
and the like, the Srpska army possesses a number of respectable 
forces for antiaircraft defense. First, what is involved are 
massive antiaircraft artillery pieces, including the most modern 
antiaircraft guns of the Bofors type, of Swedish production. 
This weapon has a laser sight that enables a maximum precision 
of hitting targets in the air. It has a great fire 
concentration of several thousand rounds per minute. I would 
also like to stress that numbers [masovnost] of these weapons 
and the density of fire not only aim to down the enemy plane but 
also hamper it in performing its task. 
  Second are the portable missile launchers of the Strela type 
-- Strela 1, Strela 2M, and the latest type of Strela. These 
launchers are held on a fighter's shoulder and can hit a target 
of up to 3.5 km on arrival and departure. These weapons are a 
special threat to fighter bombers, for whom the said altitude is 
the most suitable in order to successfully hit targets. 
Therefore, when attacking, planes would have to descend to this 
altitude and then they would find themselves within the range of 
these missiles. 
  Of course, the next significant missile system is the KUB, 
which has a high maneuvering capability. It consists of three 
launchers mounted on one vehicle. It is used to hit targets at 
medium and high altitudes. These systems protect a territory 
and a disposition of units over a large area of land. 
  Finally, one of the significant systems of antiaircraft 
defense that the Srpska army possesses is the stationary missile 
system (Volhov). These are the largest and most powerful 
antiaircraft missiles that the Srpska army possesses. The 
present model of this missile system has been considerably 
modernized with a built-in special control system. This was 
done several years ago in one of the factories that is still 
operating in the Serbian Republic. It efficiently hits combat 
aircraft at the altitude of as much as 30 km and flying at all 
speeds that modern combat aircraft can reach. 
  What is characteristic about this missile system (Volhov) is 
that apart from being able to hit aircraft at very low 
altitudes, they can also hit targets on the ground, which would 
be the weapons that [word indistinct] possesses. 
  Let me also point out that despite all the modern technology 
for discovering targets, even throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
that NATO pilots certainly possess -- and they certainly possess 
information acquired with the help of the AWACS system and 
directly in the field, as well as with other electronic devices 
-- they can hardly discover Serbian forces' targets for the 
already mentioned reasons, something that the U.S. generals have 
also warned about. Even when a target is found, one has to 
attain a direct hit in order to destroy that target, something 
that is hardly possible even under the ideal conditions of 
training. After all, let us take a look at experiences from the 
Gulf war, where a view of the terrain is considerably better and 
camouflage less possible, and still efficiency attained was only 
15 percent of direct hits with all launched missiles and 
projectiles. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] The Muslim army today continued to attack the 
Vitez and Novi Travnik areas and a general alert was also 
sounded in Kiseljak. Heavy street fighting is still under way in 
the area of Buhine Kuce, on the eastern approaches to Vitez. The 
Muslim units, reinforced with new forces from Zenica, are still 
trying to regain the positions they lost yesterday and get 
access to the Vitez-Busovaca road. 
  The Muslim army continues to pound the center of Vitez, 
using 
mortars and heavy guns. Novi Travnik has also been shelled 
throughout the day, as have the surrounding areas held by the 
Croatian Defense Council [HVO]heavily pounded from the Muslim 
howitzers and mortars are the town centernd the area of 
Rastovci. It has been reported from Novi Travnik that the HVO 
repelled a heavy infantry attack on Relej, a hill near the town. 
The Muslim forces suffered a major defeat and were forced to 
withdraw, with heavy losses. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Belgrade, January 11 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Croat 
forces have repulsed a Moslem offensive on the area of Vitez in 
central Bosnia-Herzegovina and forced the Moslem troops to 
withdraw from the Busovaca-Vitez road, where the two sides on 
Monday engaged in hand-to-hand fighting, the Defence Ministry of 
the Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna in the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina said on Tuesday. 
  Bosnian Croat units (HVO) [Croatian Defense Council] stopped 
the Moslem advance on the Novi Travnik-Nova Bila road south of 
Vitez, the ministry said. 
  Over the past two days, eight people were killed and 35 
civilians wounded in the region of Vitez. Another 35 people are 
missing and the Croat authorities believe that 14 Croat women 
have been taken prisoners. 
  Fighting continued unabated despite talks on Sunday and 
Monday between President of the Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Croatia Franjo Tudjman and Bosnian Moslem leader Alija 
Izetbegovic in Bonn and efforts of Western leaders to reconcile 
the former allies in the war against the Serbs. 
  Over the past few days, Moslem forces were persistently 
opening fire from all weapons on Vitez, Novi Travnik, Novi 
Seher, Zepce and Zavidovici in central Bosnia, the strategically 
important region because most of former Yugoslavia's military 
industry is situated there. 
  Moslem-controlled Sarajevo Radio, however, claimed on 
Tuesday 
that HVO troops were shelling the old part of Vitez and using 
poisonous gases in attacks on Dubravica. 
  The situation in the area of Gornji Vakuf is more or less 
the 
same and the usual 500 shells again on Monday fell on the town 
and the nearby Moslem villages, said Sarajevo Radio. 
  Bosnian Serb Army sources said Moslem forces had continued 
persistent attacks on all Serb positions in the area of Doboj in 
northern Bosnia, where the re-grouping of Moslem troops for a 
possible attack on Brcko was also observed. 
  During the night, Moslem units in the region of the River 
Brka some eight kilometres south-west of Brcko received 
reinforcement from Tuzla and Zvornik, the sources said. 
  The arrival of fresh Moslem troops was accompanied by the 
re-grouping of those already on the spot as well as by intensive 
reconnaissance of Serb positions south of Brcko with the aim of 
preparing a new offensive and cutting off the Bosnian Serb 
Republic into two parts.

  [Text] Romania's Presidency has faxed us President 
Iliescu's statement, which reads as follows: 
  The summit meeting of the NATO countries' heads of states 
and 
governments has taken a historic decision regarding the 
expansion of the Alliance toward the Central and Eastern part of 
Europe, through a gradually developing process whose first step 
is the Partnership for Peace program. 
  We hail this decision, which we consider an element that 
strengthens the security of our country, and of the other 
countries in this part of our continent, in the new 
circumstances brought about by the changes that have taken place 
after the elimination of totalitarian regimes in Central and 
East Europe. 
  Romania is vitally interested in the establishment of a 
viable system of security on our continent based on the 
institutions of European dimension that throughout history have 
proved their capacity to ensure peace and tranquility in Europe. 
We view the NATO as the major organization capable of ensuring 
the necessary framework for stability and security in Europe. 
Romania's relations and cooperation with the countries that are 
members of the NATO is based both on the historic tradition of 
Romanian civilization in the European region, as well as on the 
community of interests and engagements toward the values of 
democracy and the rule-of-law state that our society regained 
after the 1989 December revolution. 
  On this occasion, I also deem it necessary to reassert 
Romania's constant interest in becoming a NATO member, a goal 
also shared by all important political forces of our country and 
I declare that we accept the Partnership for Peace also as a 
preliminary stage in the integration process and a form of 
many-sided cooperation aimed at the gradual fulfillment of the 
requirements imposed by the statute of membership of the 
Alliance, reads the Romanian president's declaration. 
  The basic document established with a view to substantiating 
the Partnership for Peace has an outstanding importance and 
sanctions fundamental principles for the relations between 
partners, among them the engagement to consolidate the 
democratic processes, the abstention from the use of force or 
the threat of force against the territorial integrity and 
political independence of any state, respect for existing 
borders, and the need to settle conflicts solely through 
peaceful means. 
  The statements also assess that immediate measures will be 
taken for the competent bodies to examine the documents of the 
Brussels summit, so that, in the shortest time possible, 
discussions can start with a view to signing the basic document 
and proceed to negotiations for concluding other documents that 
are required by participation in the Partnership for Peace. 
  In conclusion, the Romanian president's statement reads: 
  Romania is ready to assume all responsibility incumbent on 
it 
as a participant in the partnership and, in the future, in the 
Alliance, and it is determined to make a contribution to the 
joint efforts to ensure stability in the region and in Europe as 
a whole.

  [Text] The Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] faxed 
our editorial office the following communique: 
  The PDSR acknowledges with satisfaction the recent position 
taken by the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] regarding the need 
to reach a historical reconciliation between Hungry and its 
neighboring countries, including Romania. 
  No doubt, the communique reads, such a reconciliation, in 
our 
opinion, should be sanctioned through the conclusion, as soon as 
possible, of a basic treaty between the two countries, a treaty 
that would confirm the current borders and would include mutual 
engagements in accordance with international norms regarding the 
insurance of the rights of national minorities. 
  The PDSR believes that the national interests of Romania and 
Hungary require that the relations between the two countries 
should be freed from the bitter burden of the past, and the 
settlement of these relations should ensure security, 
territorial integrity, and the prosperity of the two neighboring 
nations, namely the Romanian and Hungarian nations. 
  The communique also notes that not only the lessons of 
history, but also the current requirements of the European 
system direct us toward this goal. The normalization and 
development of Romanian- Hungarian relations would speed up the 
process of integration of the two countries in the Euro-Atlantic 
structures and would facilitate the success of democratic 
transformations, of reform, and of the transition to market 
economy in our countries. The communique also mentions that, as 
a matter of fact, the draft plan for stability in Europe 
proposed by France and adopted by the Group of 12, sets the act 
of finding bilateral solutions, through negotiations to possible 
problems that still exist among them, as a condition for a 
future integration with complete rights of our countries in the 
European Union, the way it is also suggested by NATO's 
Partnership for Peace. 
  Therefore, the PDSR reaffirms its confidence that realistic 
forces in Romania and Hungry will succeed in bringing about the 
complete normalization and development of relations between them 
as soon as possible, including the conclusion of a basic treaty 
that will serve the interests of the two neighboring people and 
the cause of security and peace, the communique sent to us by 
the PDSR reads in conclusion.

  [Excerpts] Immediately before the meeting between the 
Visegrad four presidents and U.S. President Clinton, Slovak 
President Michal Kovac said that if Visegrad Group countries are 
not sufficiently mature to enter NATO, they could at least join 
NATO's political structures. Based on this, we asked Ivan 
Mjartan, Slovak ambassador to the Czech Republic, whether this 
attitude was still valid after the adoption of the 
U.S.-sponsored Partnership for Peace plan by NATO yesterday. 
  [Begin Mjartan recording] [passage omitted] President Kovac 
wished to indicate that he could see another, more dynamic way 
of incorporating the Visegrad Four countries into NATO. His 
idea is based on the fact that incorporating into NATO's 
political structures will immediately create certain security 
guarantees and will provide guarantees in the process of 
creating another sphere of security and cooperation in Europe, 
in particular in eastern Europe. 
  The NATO summit unanimously approved the U.S.-sponsored 
Partnership for Peace proposal yesterday. We emphasized on 
several occasions -- not only in speeches by the president and 
the prime minister, and in speeches by our other representatives 
-- that the Partnership for Peace is an acceptable alternative 
at this stage for us. We regard it as an intermediate stage 
which will be followed -- as we expect -- by the adoption of a 
specific timetable for a further course of action by both the 
United States and NATO. The outcome of this should be the final 
and full-fledged membership of these countries in NATO. 
  Given this situation, the Partnership for Peace is in fact 
the only and acceptable alternative for us. [end recording]

Peace. We pledge ourselves that we will take immediate action so 
that we can conclude the relevant agreements. Naturally, this is 
also an opportunity for us to inform the United States about our 
endeavors here at home in the Slovak Republic to continue in the 
process of strengthening the plurality system of democracy, 
transformation, and economic reforms. As you know, at the same 
time this will also provide an opportunity for bilateral talks 
with representatives of the Visegrad Group. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Regular weekly interview with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav </F>
Klaus by correspondent Stahlavsky on 11 January; place not 
given--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Stahlavsky] Prime Minister, the most important 
event this week is undoubtedly the U.S. President's visit to 
Prague. This interview is being recorded on Tuesday morning, 
only a few hours before Bill Clinton's arrival. Do you think 
that choosing our capital city for the Visegrad Four summit 
testifies to something that is good for our country? 
  [Klaus] I do not think we should get involved in endless 
polemics with our neighbors as to why this meeting is taking 
place in Prague and not in Budapest or Warsaw. This is 
pointless, and I know that our neighbors are very sensitive to 
this sort of thing. On the other hand, it is quite obvious, 
evident, and clear that choosing Prague was not an act of God 
and that, therefore, the U.S. side had a reason for making this 
choice. 
  [Stahlavsky] In this context, one should note that the 
volume 
of U.S. foreign investment in our country is the second highest. 
In 1993, total foreign investment amounted to $0.5 billion. Was 
it enough? 
  [Klaus] I think this was just right, really quite right. I 
have said repeatedly that it is not the government's job to 
artificially accelerate or, through various errors, to slow down 
the influx of foreign investment. This level of foreign 
investment is absolutely adequate to what the economy needs. I 
would like to warn, however, against accelerating the influx of 
foreign capital into nonprivatized enterprises. 
  [Stahlavsky] When I look back at the days past, one of the 
important events was undoubtedly Slovakia's overdraft on the 
limit credit in the mutual clearing account with the Slovak 
Republic, as well as the relatively fast settlement of this 
overdraft. However, you said that the method of Czech-Slovak 
clearing is being analyzed, and you did not rule out its 
reassessment. 
  [Klaus] When speaking about the reassessment or supplements 
to the system, I am not thinking about abolishing it or changing 
it in any fundamental way. I think the fast Slovak payment is a 
signal that the Slovak side really fulfills the things that are 
part of an already signed agreement. This is something for our 
citizens to differentiate between. As for the property issue, no 
agreement has been achieved yet. However, where there is an 
agreement, the Slovak side meets its obligations with great 
precision. This was also the case in this particular event. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Stahlavsky] [passage omitted] At the end of the last year, 
you indicated that there is a certain revival of useful economic 
contacts with the countries of the former so-called real 
socialism bloc. What is your idea of our future cooperation with 
these countries, especially now, after we, as an unofficial 
spokesman of Central and East Europe, became a member of the UN 
Security Council? 
  [Klaus] The contacts of the Czech Government and Czech 
politicians, as well as the contacts of Czech business with 
eastern countries, are growing rather than declining. I 
think--and I repeat this--this is good. 
  The Cabinet has made decisions about a number of trips that 
should take place this year. I am personally sure about a visit 
to Moscow. Nevertheless, this will be possible when there has 
been some stabilization, when it has become clear what the newly 
established parliament will do, whether the stability of the 
government will or will not be maintained. In any case, I hope 
this will be decided within a few weeks, and my visit should 
certainly take place then. 
  I expect to visit the Baltic republics. I have an invitation 
from all three governments of these countries. An invitation 
from Belarus is on my table, as is one from Ukraine. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article including statement by Antonia Haga, </F>
National Assembly representative of the Alliance of Free 
Democrats: "Osztojkan Leaves SZDSZ, to Antonia Haga's Regret"] 
  [Text] The leaders of 12 Romany organizations in Hungary 
wrote a letter to Arpad Goncz, president of the Republic, asking 
him not to sign the amended election law because it completely 
precludes any possibility that the ethnic minorities will gain 
parliamentary representation in their own right. 
  The National Assembly's decision is not concerned at all 
with 
the rights of minorites and is contrary to the Constitution, the 
minority law, and the stance that the parties and the public 
profess to take toward minorites, announced Bela Osztojkan, 
president of the Phralipe Independent Gypsy Organization at the 
years-end meeting of Romany organizations. 
  The Gypsy organizations do not have enough resources at 
their 
disposal today to get even one Gypsy representative elected to 
the parliament on their own. They have started negotiations 
with Peter Zwack's Civic Party concerning possible cooperation, 
and the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum] will probably run two 
Romany candidates--Jozsef Raguly of the Hundred-Member Gypsy 
Orchestra and Florian Farkas of Lungo Drom--in the elections. At 
the end of the meeting Bela Osztojkan said that the parliament 
is completely insensitive to the problems of the minorities, and 
for this reason he as an individual will not vote and will leave 
the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. 
  "I am sorry that Bela Osztojkan will leave the SZDSZ, but I 
am even sorrier that neither he nor I can find a better solution 
for the representation of the minorities in the present 
parliamentary structure," said Antonia Haga, Romany 
representative and member of the SZDSZ's parliamentary group. 
The representative does not consider acceptable either the 
present situation or the version of the election law that was 
voted down, which would have put 13 representatives into the 
National Assembly on the basis of minority lists. "This way, 
once again only token Gypsies, token Croatians, and token 
Swabians, who would not even be able to come to agreement on the 
most important questions, would sit in the parliament." 
According to Antonia Haga, appropriate minority representation 
is imaginable only in a two-chamber parliament. 
  [According to Duna TV, on 7 January President Goncz told the 
Minority Roundtable that he has not decided yet whether he will 
sign the election law or submit it to the Constitutial Court for 
a ruling on its constitutionality. He added that he has 13 days 
to make a decision.]

  [Text] Warsaw, 12 Jan -- This morning, President Lech 
Walesa left Warsaw for Prague where he is to meet the leaders of 
the Visegrad Group and President Bill Clinton. Asked by 
journalists at Warsaw military airport whether his "propaganda 
offensive" has changed the position of western states, the 
president replied: "I think that no more can be done after the 
NATO summit in Brussels." The president added that world public 
opinion "should exert greater pressure on politicians not to 
repeat the same mistakes." "There are opportunities which have 
to be taken, agreements which have to be kept," the president 
said, adding that he hopes that in Prague "we do more for a more 
secure and more human future."

  [Text] Belgrade, Jan 11 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serbs on Tuesday 
[11 January] dismissed NATO's latest warning that it might bomb 
Serb positions in Bosnia to break the siege of Sarajevo and 
other threatened areas as "unworkable" and a "storm in a teacup." 
  "We have been threatened for two years and these threats are 
unworkable," General Manojlo Milovanovic, chief of staff of 
Bosnian Serb forces, told AFP. "Before bombing the Serbs, they 
would first have to distance them from Moslem positions," he 
said, stressing the close proximity of Moslem and Serb positions 
on the ground in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA meanwhile said as long as 
French peacekeeping forces are in Bosnia, "we can say with 
certainty that the French will not support any military 
intervention" against the Serbs. "These new NATO threats of 
bombing are a storm in a teacup," the agency said. 
  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Brussels on 
Tuesday said the Alliance was ready to launch if necessary -- 
under the authority of the UN Security Council -- air strikes 
against Bosnian Serbs, notably to open up the airport in Tuzla 
in the northeast and to give tactical support to allow some 300 
Canadians blocked for six months by Serbs in the eastern Moslem 
enclave of Srebrenica to be relieved. A NATO bombing would 
force the Serbs to "re-examine all concessions made to the 
Moslems," Bosnian Serb strongman Radovan Karadzic had said 
Monday [10 January]. The speaker of the Bosnian Serb 
self-proclaimed parliament, Momcilo Krajisnik, meanwhile hailed 
NATO's decision to "give priority to the negotiating process" on 
Bosnia, without even bothering to comment on the new threats of 
bombing. 
  Though NATO has on earlier occasions threatened possible air 
strikes to free surrounded civilians, get through humanitarian 
aid or protect UN troops, the Alliance has never carried out the 
threats. On each occasion, Karadzic has reported that any 
foreign bombing in Bosnian would turn each UN soldier into a 
potential target for Serbian reprisal attacks. There was no 
immediate reaction from Belgrade Tuesday on the NATO warnings 
against its allies in Bosnia. But it was seen among Belgrade 
circles as new pressure on Serbs prior to the negotiations on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina due to resume on January 18 in Geneva with 
the Moslems, Serbs and Croats to try to reach agreement.

<F P=106> [News conference by President Franjo Tudjman with foreign </F>
and domestic correspondents in the Presidential palace in Zagreb 
on 11 January following his return from Bonn -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Good evening. Croatian Radio and 
Television. Mr. President, at the Croatian initiative, in Bonn, 
another proposal was made to normalize Muslim-Croat relations. 
The reply is expected in three days time. What are your 
expectations? What will happen despite all of this fighting in 
Bosnia? 
  [Tudjman] As you said, I initiated a new meeting -- for two 
reasons. First, despite the fact that all the sides, therefore 
the Muslims too, undertook the obligation in Brussels to halt 
hostilities during the Christmas holidays -- between 22 December 
and 15 January -- the Muslim offensive in central Bosnia still 
continued and threatened not only the population of Novi 
Travnik, Vitez, Busovaca, Kiseljak, and Kresevo, over 100,000 
Croats, but it also posed the threat of an ecological 
catastrophe, since an explosives factory is situated in Vitez. 
Understandably, the Muslim forces wanted to take the factory 
and it was to be assumed that the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] 
units would not allow the factory to fall into the hands of the 
Muslims. This could cause an ecological catastrophe, high 
casualties, and tens of thousands of new refugees. This was one 
of the reasons why exactly a week ago I proposed another meeting 
with Alija Izetbegovic to point out the possible catastrophic 
consequences for relations in the area, the current situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and for the future relations between the 
Croat and Muslim people. 
  The second reason was my intention to present once again 
Croatia's stands, the stands Croatia has been advocating since 
the very beginning of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina about the 
need and necessity for the Croatian people to be interested in 
cooperation with the Muslims; likewise for the Muslims not only 
because of their survival but because of the fact that it would 
be linked to western civilization by relying on Croatia. To 
this effect in this proposition of ours, in the draft 
contractual agreement, we presented concrete proposals for 
cooperation within a union of Bosnia-Herzegovina, or else if a 
parting of the ways takes place -- something the Muslim 
leadership has already opted for, then we propose cooperation 
between a Bosnian-Muslim republic, i.e. state, and Croatia. 
This document in fact conveys the continuity of this Croatian 
policy. 
  [Modric] Sanja Modric, NOVI LIST. I would like to ask you -- 
we read in VJESNIK today, it appears that Sarajevo radio has 
reported this, too -- that in Bonn you offered, and of course, 
Izetbegovic rejected this, that in Bonn you offered, that it 
would be possible to build some port in Peljesac for the 
Muslims. As we know very little about this, would you explain 
it in more detail. What is at issue here? 
  [Tudjman] Since Mr. Izetbegovic reiterates his demand that 
Neum should be ceded to a Bosnian-Muslim republic, i.e. state, 
that it should be placed under full sovereignty, I explained 
again that from a Croatian point of view such a demand was 
unacceptable, that it would mean a breakup of Croatian territory 
and the Croatian people. It would pose a threat to southern 
Croatia, including Dubrovnik. This demand is in fact in line 
with something Serbia's policy has demanded for over a century. 
It wanted to conquer Dubrovnik in this war, too. 
  Consequently, I said that we could only agree to what we had 
agreed aboard Invincible, i.e. we offer the Muslims a free zone 
in Ploce. We make it possible for them to build their own port 
on the Neretva. In Neum only the construction of a tourist 
facility appears as a possibility, on Croatian territory under 
joint management. 
  During the two days of talks in Bonn I said that instead of 
Neum we could offer this solution: That we rent some tourist 
accommodation to the Muslims on the Peljesac peninsula, where 
they could then be linked with their, actually not their, but a 
free zone in Ploce. In that way it could be thought that we 
again showed goodwill to find a solution with the Muslims, 
despite their demand regarding Neum, which is unacceptable for 
us. 
  I also reminded not only the Muslim leadership but also the 
European participants in the talks that the truce agreements of 
Pozarevac and Sremski Karlovci, of 1699 and 1718 respectively, 
through which the Dubrovnik diplomats succeeded in getting the 
two buffer zones at Neum and Sutorina, did not give access to 
the sea to the Bosnia of that period, but that this was a buffer 
zone by the sea which had a role of separating the area under 
the Venetians from Dubrovnik. 
  Many of them at the talks in Bonn were surprised by this 
and, 
as you know, this solidified the viewpoint of serious people in 
Europe that Croatia cannot agree to giving any sovereignty to 
Bosnia over Neum, for that would threaten Croatia's strategic, 
national, and state interests. 
  [Correspondent] VJESNIK. Mr, President, did the Muslims 
perhaps offer us something in central Bosnia? 
  [Tudjman] They did. Their offer was that we should let them 
have central Bosnia or else their army will seize the whole 
central Bosnia, which was, according to the Vance-Owen plan on 
reorganizing Bosnia into provinces, provinces with the majority 
Croatian population, and also according to the current borders 
of the republics within the Bosnian union, envisaged to be a 
part of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. 
  They are carrying out the offensive in today's central 
Bosnia 
in order to conquer these areas. I told them that the Serbs too 
agreed that Croatia should get 17.5 percent of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina territory and that this is the absolute 
minimum the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Croatia -- for 
strategic reasons -- can agree to, that it is out of the 
question that Croatia should cede this territory, because these 
areas have predominantly Croat population, because the Croats 
lived in Bosnia-Herzegovina before the Muslims, and because the 
Croats defended these areas first from the Serb aggression and 
are defending it now from the Muslim aggression. 
  Consequently, their demand, the Muslims' position is 
therefore totally incomprehensible, as they lay claim to this 
area, because of the demographic composition of the population 
as well as because of the fact that this would reduce the share 
of the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna in the distribution of 
these republics within the present Bosnia-Herzegovina, i.e. in a 
future union. In this respect Mr. Izetbegovic put forward a 
very interesting proposition and a very understandable one from 
their point of view -- that we should come up with a joint stand 
according to which the Bosnia-Muslim republic and the Croatian 
republic should be given 51 percent of territory and the Serbs, 
consequently, 49 percent. 
  Acceptable at first glance. They, however, wanted to conquer 
2 or 3 percent, included in this percentage -- 51, precisely in 
central Bosnia which was earmarked for the Croat republic. I 
pointed out that we cannot accept this as there is no other area 
inhabited by Croatian population that might be included in the 
Croat republic in the course of dividing up, either within the 
framework of a union or in a total parting of the ways. 
Consequently, one can conclude that Mr.Izetbegovic and his 
leaders invested every effort to, first, conquer militarily and 
then, possibly, achieve agreement at the negotiating table so 
the Croatian side would give up these areas which, as I say, for 
historical, political and strategic reasons as well as because 
of the present democratic state of affairs are such that it is 
logical that they should belong to the Croat republic in the 
division. 
  As far as that meeting and our proposal are concerned, it 
should be pointed out that our proposal was focused on the need 
to cease all hostilities. For their part, the Muslims stress 
that they now have an army of 200,000 soldiers. Unfortunately, 
by far the largest part of that army is directed against 
Croatian areas, against the HVO. In reality, they are not 
engaged in combat with Serbian forces anywhere, apart from 
clashes and mutual artillery attacks around Sarajevo. 
  Therefore, the Muslim armed forces are directed against 
Croatian forces and Croatian areas. This is one of the reasons, 
along with the two reasons I mentioned earlier, for an immediate 
cessation of hostilities. 
  We also initiated a proposal on cooperation and friendship 
between the Croatian and Muslim peoples within the union; a 
proposal on cooperation and very close links, almost a 
confederal alliance between the Bosnian Muslim and the Croatian 
republics and their alliance with Croatia. As we were aware 
that the Muslim leadership had already opted for partition of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, at the end of the talks we presented our 
proposals on cooperation between the Bosnian Muslim state and 
the Croatian state after the breakup of the union, i.e., the 
present Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Current attempts to seize the Croatian areas [in Bosnia] 
prove that the Muslim leadership has chosen partition, i.e., 
creation of their Muslim state. After Mr. Izetbegovic, 
Silajdzic, and Komsic signed an agreement with me on 14 
September providing for cooperation between the Bosnian Muslim 
and Croat republics, and their cooperation with Croatia, Mr. 
Izetbegovic signed an agreement with the Serbs granting the 
Bosnian Muslim republic UN membership in case of a breakup. 
This was in reality an agreement on partition. 
  Just before the NATO summit in Brussels the Muslim 
leadership 
sent a proposal according to which NATO would offer guarantees 
for the Bosnian Muslim state. In the proposal they call it the 
pluralist Bosnia-Herzegovina, i.e. the victim state. This means 
that they did not even raise the issue of entire 
Bosnia-Herzegovina but instead they brought up the issue about 
ways in which NATO would offer guarantees for the borders and 
the viability of such a state. Therefore it is obvious that the 
current leadership has opted to create a Muslim state. 
  I must admit that during the talks with us, Mr. Izetbegovic 
and the members of his delegation said that their prime 
objective was to preserve the union, but that clearly all 
possibilities had to be examined. But we did not spend much 
time on that problem, because the main problem was how to halt 
the hostilities and to explain that conquering central Bosnia, 
which is what the Muslim forces are trying to do, not only 
threatening tens and almost hundreds of thousands of the 
Croatian people, and creating streams of refugees [sentence 
incomplete as heard]. 
  Therefore this poses the danger that any future cooperation 
between the Croatian and Muslim people, between the Croatian and 
Muslim states, will be made impossible. 
  Mr. Izetbegovic admitted in principle that the Muslims have 
to be interested in cooperation with Croatia. He described our 
proposals as exceptionally useful. He said it in the presence 
of the entire delegations, the cochairmen of the conference on 
the former Yugoslavia and high-ranking German diplomats. This 
was said in Germany and then after the talks, I heard, he said 
that the talks had not produced any results. He even said that 
our proposals were, as a whole, acceptable, and that they would 
be discussed in Sarajevo and he would personally use his 
influence for the proposals to be accepted by others in Sarajevo. 
  We agreed that they should reply to us in writing before the 
Geneva conference, which will be held on 15 January. Well, God 
willing, we will see. 
  [Novak] Hloverka Novak, DANAS. Mr. President, some say 
that this peace proposal of yours is the last offer by the 
Croatian side to the Muslims. If Alija Izetbegovic and the 
Muslim leadership refuse your peace proposal, what will happen? 
Does this inevitably mean war, or new negotiations? What do 
you expect the international community's reaction to be like in 
the light of the Muslim leadership's attitude? 
  [Tudjman] Let us be sensible and say that in the politics, 
the same as in life, as long as there is politics, as long as 
there is life of a man or of a nation we cannot say that 
something is the last thing. Consequently, we are compelled to 
have talks until we find a solution. We will be ready to 
continue the talks. 
  But what you said is completely true, that in our proposal 
and our examination of the geographical settlement we have 
really reached the last straw and the Croatian side in this 
respect cannot yield. We said so. We can state with pleasure 
that all important international factors both in Europe and the 
world have recognized the truth that in these negotiations 
Croatia has been behaving very consistently in aspiring toward 
peace, that it has been ready to offer proposals which are 
acceptable for all three sides and in that sense the 
international factors likewise understood our resolve when it 
came to the points where there can be no yielding. 
  I could say that since my initiative, I think it was at the 
beginning, on 5 or 6 November, and in the course of both 
conferences within the European Union, first the Geneva 
conference organized by the European Union and then the Brussels 
conference, and this one with this new proposal, that all 
important international factors became completely convinced in 
the consistency of the Croatian policy, the benevolence of the 
Croatian policy; and that with that Croatia's international 
position as regards the final phase of the resolution of that 
crisis on the territory of former Yugoslavia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has been considerably strengthened. 
  [Correspsondent] Swiss radio. Mr. President, you said that 
the Muslims had decided in favor of a Muslim state, that the 
Bosnian government had decided in favor of a Muslim state. 
Could that in the end provoke Croatia to derecognize 
Bosnia-Herzegovina? If Croatia makes such a step, would that 
provoke the Croatian Army to intervene in Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Tudjman] If the Muslim offensive and their efforts to 
create 
a Muslim state directly threatened the Croatian territories, 
including the border territories of Croatia, it is obvious that 
Croatia would have to protect its borders. 
  It is no secret that in Herceg-Bosna a considerable number 
of 
volunteers from Croatia has been involved in fighting. But 
these are volunteers who were born in Bosnia-Herzegovina, who 
fought in the homeland war against the Serbian aggression in 
Croatia, and who went back there as volunteers to defend their 
homes, their land, first from the Serbian aggression and now 
from the Muslim aggression. As regards accusations that regular 
formations of the Croatian Army have been involved in fighting 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, I said that there were no regular 
formations of the Croatian Army there: These are volunteers who 
were born in Bosnia-Herzegovina and those who are working 
abroad, in Europe and other countries, who keep contacting us 
wishing to join their ranks. 
  Consequently, the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina are 
interested in protecting their home territory, securing its 
survival. I told Mr. Izetbegovic that the Croatian policy has 
been and is going to remain... [pauses] that we have even been 
ready to influence the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina to remain 
within the Bosniak Muslim republic, as a considerable number of 
Muslims will remain within the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, 
and that their human and national rights must be secured on the 
basis of reciprocity. These Croats in the Bosnian republic and 
the Muslims in the Croat republic, can be a bridge for 
overcoming animosity that has been created in this horrific war, 
and for restoring permanent cooperation and friendship in the 
future. 
  [Modric] Modric, YOMIURI SHIMBUN. Mr. President, the map 
the Croatian press revealed today is not exactly clear. At 
first glance it appears as if the whole of Kiseljak and its 
surrounds are missing. Is it true that this part is included in 
the Muslim republic? Thank you. 
  [Tudjman] This is precisely what reflects the Croatian 
side's 
willingness to contribute its share to a solution that would 
enable the Bosnian-Muslim republics to meet territorial 
conditions, too, for an independent life. In this demarcation, 
in opposition to the Muslims' general demand that they get all 
the areas of central Bosnia, meaning Travnik and Novi Travnik 
and Vitez and Busovaca and Kiseljak and Kresevo, in the course 
of talks we agreed to this with the Croats of Herceg-Bosna so 
they would remain within the framework of the Bosnian-Muslim 
republic, Kiseljak and Kresevo with their dominantly Croat 
populations, but that Busovaca, Vitez and Novi Travnik should by 
all means be included in Croatia [as heard]. 
  Likewise, Bugojno and Gornji Vakuf, too, which were 
inhabited 
by predominantly mainly Muslim populations. In this way one 
ends up with a map such as the one you have seen. It is compact 
in terms of Croatian territory. On the other hand with 
Kiseljak, because of the fact that Bugojno and Gornji Vakuf are 
to be included in the Croat republic, one gets compact territory 
linked to Croatia. On the other hand, by leaving Kiseljak and 
Kresevo to the Bosnian-Muslim republic they receive an area 
around Sarajevo which is in territorial terms capable of 
supporting the existence of their independent state. This is 
what I was speaking about, in this way preconditions would also 
be created for cooperation and friendship and an alliance, both 
economic and defensive, as we suggested between the 
Bosnian-Muslim state and the Croatian state at a later stage. 
  [Correspondent] DAILY TELEGRAPH, London. Could you try to 
explain to me Mr. Tudjman -- from Croatia's point of view what 
kind of role is Mr. Boban playing in the light of these new 
negotiations on Bosnia-Herzegovina?. Do you fully and 
unreservedly support Mr. Boban as a legally elected 
representative of Croats in Bosnia? 
  [Tudjman] Mr. Boban became the leader of the Croat people in 
Herzeg-Bosna during the resistance struggle against the Serb 
aggressor. At that time I personally had neither known him nor 
had I heard of him, nor had probably the majority of the people 
from political leadership. 
  However, he was doubtlessly legitimately elected, as you 
said 
yourself, during the self-organized resistance struggle of the 
Croat people against the Serb and later also the Muslim 
aggression. He has played an exceptionally important role in 
the Croat people's resistance against the Serb and later Muslim 
aggression in central Bosnia. But there are people in the 
Muslim leadership, including Mr. Izetbegovic, and others too, 
who also spread these ideas abroad, They laid the blame for the 
Muslim-Croat conflict on Mr. Boban and also the responsibility 
for the failure of the Muslim-Croat talks. It was clear to me, 
personally, and to other people that this was not true. But 
even in this respect the Croatian side showed its readiness to 
do everything possible, to remove all, even fictitious, 
obstacles to an agreement, that is to create all preconditions 
to reach an agreement. 
  I must say here that Mr. Boban, as a great patriot, as a man 
who placed his personal resources at the service of the homeland 
and the people of Herceg-Bosna, has said that he is a soldier of 
his people and that he will accept any solution which is in the 
interest of the Croatian people. Mr. Boban has remained the 
president of what they call the community of Herceg-Bosna, but 
he is not taking part in further talks to prevent the Muslim 
side using the argument that they cannot talk to Boban. So, 
they are talking to other people now and have received in 
written form everything that can be offered to them. 
  I think that the Croatian side has thereby shown its 
unreserved willingness to do everything to create conditions to 
end hostilities and initiate cooperation and friendship with the 
Muslim people in the future. 
  [Correspondent] Does this mean that Mr. Boban is not going 
to take part in the talks in Geneva... 
  [Tudjman, interrupting] This is not important. It depends on 
the nature of the talks. As you already know, in addition to 
the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union] leadership, Herceg-Bosna has 
got its government, it has its assembly, a presidential council 
has been set up, they have the entire leadership which will 
appoint their representatives. It is important to restore 
peace, to achieve a solution that is in the interest of both the 
Croat and Muslim nations. 
  I will tell you one more thing: When we proposed cooperation 
with the Muslims on such a broad basis, when we urged right from 
the outset that the Croats should take part in the referendum 
for an independent Bosnia, when we were the first to recognize 
[Bosnia] and send our ambassador to Sarajevo, then we bore in 
mind the interests of the Croatian people, the strategic 
interests of the Croatian state, but also the interests of the 
Muslim people and the interests of the Western world, because we 
knew that the Western world wanted the Muslims to rely on 
Croatia and be linked through Croatia with Western civilization. 
  Contrary to extremist views that have surfaced in this war, 
and statements that we have heard when they said they wished to 
destroy Croatia, and that it was wrong for the Muslims to have 
gone with the Croats rather than with the Serbs, contrary to 
these and such views we have been doing everything on our part 
to prevent some fundamentalist and extremist elements from 
turning Bosnia into a hotbed of terrorist attacks, to which the 
Croats have unfortunately been already exposed in the horrific 
massacre of the Croat people in Algiers; such incidents have 
been recorded elsewhere, in Europe also, in individual 
showdowns. Consequently, it is in the interest of the Croat 
people and the Western world that the Bosnian Muslims become a 
constituent part of Western civilization, which they can remain 
to be by relying on and being in an alliance with the Croatian 
people. 
  [Pesikar] Mate Pesikar, VECERNJI LIST. Mr. President, please 
tell us just a bit more about the territorial settlement. What 
is the destiny of Bosnian Posavina? Thank you. 
  [Tudjman] As you can see on this map, our demand has been 
and 
continues to be, that the largest part of Croat-populated 
territories in Bosnian Posavina be included into the Croat 
republic of Herceg-Bosna. In this respect I owe an explanation 
to our people. 
  We, the Croatian people, were not able to defend all those 
areas in [northern] Herceg-Bosna to the same extent that we were 
able to do so in southern Bosnia and in Herzegovina. The reason 
is simple: The Yugo-communist Army and then Serbia had such huge 
supremacy in tank forces, in overall military equipment, and 
manpower in that area, and they were so much interested in 
creating a corridor between eastern Bosnia and the Banja Luka 
area, that even if we had been allowed to deploy the Croatian 
Army there we would not have been able to prevent that. Those 
few volunteers whom we could send there were not able to prevent 
that. The population of Bosnian Posavina also offered 
resistance, but a large majority, I daresay even 80 percent of 
the Croatian population fled Bosnia-Herzegovina. It should be 
recalled that in the course of fighting in Bosnian Posavina the 
Yugo-communist army and then the Serbian army bombarded and 
pounded Croatian areas in Croatia -- between Bosanski Brod and 
Zupanja, even further afield up to Pozega and Djakovo. 
  At the same time, I would like to remind you of the fact 
that 
on 12 July 1992, when signing an agreement with Mr. Izetbegovic, 
I put forward a proposal on a military alliance, by which the 
deployment of the Croatian Army formations in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
would have been legalized. However, Mr. Izetbegovic would not 
accept such a military alliance then; we only reached a 
conclusion that the Croatian Army should cooperate with the 
Bosnian Muslim forces and the Croatian Defense Council in border 
areas. Therefore, Croatia was in a very delicate position all 
the time. 
  Therefore, our demand for Bosnian Posavina to belong to the 
Croat national corpus has been and has remained the same, but it 
depended on the developments and on the situation in the Armed 
Forces in the course of the war. The territorial settlement in 
Bosnian Posavina has not been finalized in the negotiations so 
far. 
  I personally proposed to all the people in Bosnian Posavina 
to defend their areas and to organize their demands, including 
the proclamation of a separate province. Objections that we 
have allegedly forgotten about Bosnian Posavina to the benefit 
of Herceg-Bosna are completely unfounded. Not for a moment, on 
the contrary. I can even say something that a part of the 
public probably knows, I personally said: If we, with our 
volunteer forces and the local population, cannot prevent the 
corridor that the Serbs have been attacking and wish to control, 
then we have to defend Bosanski Brod as it is a part of 
Slavonski Brod. 
  However, something happened there that is still being 
examined by commissions: Why was Bosanski Brod abandoned at one 
moment contrary to all orders and, in my opinion, not under the 
pressure of the balance of forces? Consequently, we have been 
doing everything to protect our interests in Bosnian Posavina. 
  [Correspondent] One more question Mr. President. What are 
your expectations from NATO, from their latest meeting. A while 
ago you said that Izetbegovic had sent certain proposals to 
NATO. Obviously, he is expecting their help. The possibility of 
air strikes has also been mentioned. Can you comment on that? 
  [Tudjman] Mr. Izetbegovic has sent a demand to NATO only to 
come to protect borders of his state. However, we can be 
pleased with conclusions. On my return journey today I briefly 
read them. I have heard of the draft, of the proposal [as 
received], but we can be pleased with the NATO conclusions for 
two reasons: For the first time a higher level of unity within 
Europe and the United States has been created regarding the need 
to act more resolutely in the sense of searching for peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina; second, it was said that NATO, and I think 
that President Clinton in his Brussels speech had a sentence: If 
you leave such a sentence in the declaration, then everything 
must be done for its implementation [as heard]. 
  These conclusions say: NATO and the international community 
have to apply force both against those who are strangling 
Sarajevo, against those who are obstructing humanitarian 
convoys, and against those who are threatening other areas. 
This means, in other words, that air strikes could be used 
against all three sides if they obstruct what I have just 
mentioned. 
  We are welcome this. We believe that in the international 
community a demand is becoming ripe for all three sides to reach 
a final agreement, and also a standpoint that the humiliation of 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] will not be tolerated, nor 
actions by those who, despite statements on cease-fire, are 
continuing with the destruction of Sarajevo. In this case this 
can also refer to Muslims if they continue with the offensive 
against Croatian areas, which will also refer to the Croats if 
they obstruct humanitarian convoys. I am not mentioning 
anything else because the Croats are not carrying out any 
offensive operations anywhere, they are only defending their 
areas. I have not seen the entire document, but at first sight, 
judging by these few things that I have seen, we can be pleased 
with the conclusions. Two more questions please. 
  [Todorovski] Ilinka Todorovski, Slovenia TV. I have a 
question on another topical issue. Mr. President, have you been 
informed about Slovenia's decision to suspend electricity supply 
to Croatia from the Krsko nuclear power plant due to Croatia's 
outstanding financial obligations? Can you comment on that? 
  [Tudjman] I have not been informed about it, and if Slovenia 
adopts such a decision I will consider it a very unfortunate 
decision, that does not contribute to the establishment of 
normal relations; there has been discontent among the Croatian 
public and views that Slovenia is abusing the situation in which 
Croatia has found itself. Slovenia is issuing demands not 
conducive to the establishment of good-neighborly relations 
between Croatia and Slovenia for which we have been ready and 
still are. We would like all relations between Croatia and 
Slovenia to be resolved in a satisfactory way, in the interest 
of both sides, not to the detriment of anyone, and want them to 
be in accordance with the best European examples. 
  If such a decision has been made I do not consider it being 
appropriate to such aspirations. 
  [Ramljak] Olga Ramljak, SLOBODNA DALMACIJA. A while ago in 
your reply to a question you said that Croatia will persist on 
its peace proposals, but also that its proposal that was 
presented in Bonn was final. Croatian opposition parties said 
that if Croatia's peace efforts fail, if the Muslim leadership 
continues with the offensive against the Lasva River valley, 
that Croatia will have to refer to its obligations stemming from 
its constitution and protect the Croatian population using other 
means. How do you comment on this, and when will it happen if 
it had to happen? 
  [Tudjman] The Croatian state has also until today acted in 
accordance with its constitutional obligation, and as I have 
already said in my replies to your questions today, it permitted 
the deployment of volunteers [in Bosnia-Herzegovina] to protect 
Croatian areas. Croatian state policy has proved itself as very 
mature in the protection of Croatian interests and pursuant to 
this, we will adopt necessary decisions, according to given 
circumstances on the battlefield and on the international scene. 
  [Announcer] By this we are completing the news conference. 
Thank you very much and goodbye.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Croatian President Franjo Tudjman 
described the peace talks held in Petersberg [near Bonn] with 
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic as useful, during a news 
conference today. At the same time, Tudjman made it clear that 
Izetbegovic had welcomed only in principle the comprehensive 
peace agreement with Bosnia-Herzegovina that he had submitted. 
The Bosnian president had pledged to table counterproposals in 
the near future as he was unable to accept the Croatian 
proposals of his own accord. Tudjman's news conference, given 
at a packed Croatian embassy, took place without German support. 
Izetbegovic had reportedly already left Bonn by this time.

  [Text] Tirana, January 11 (ATA) -- President Berisha gave 
a reception in Durres January 10 for the diplomatic corps 
accredited in Tirana to mark the New Year. Also attending were 
representatives of international organizations. President 
Berisha greeted the participants in the reception and Romanian 
Ambassador George Miku, dean of the diplomatic corps, greeted on 
behalf of foreign diplomats. 
  Firstly, I would like to wish you and your families, your 
governments, peoples and countries wholeheartedly a Happy New 
Year, President Berisha said at the beginning of his greeting 
and added: 
  The year that elapsed some days ago was for us, Albanians, a 
year of efforts, sacrifices and challenges as well as a year 
which greatly consolidated Albania's turn on the road of 
democracy, which marked an important development and progress of 
the reform in the political, legislative, economic and 
institutional fields. In 1993, the human rights and freedoms 
were further expanded in legislation and in life, the rule of 
law is functioning increasingly better. 
  The economic reform in its major components, that is in the 
financial aspect, the privatization of the economy, the growth 
of production and attraction of foreign investment, has marked 
considerable progress, which, I hope, will make Albania in the 
future a country of fully successful reforms. 
  1993 was also the year of our great efforts to overcome the 
serious consequences of isolation, to construct a foreign policy 
based on the principle of reciprocity and in accordance with our 
national interests, which aim is to realize Albania's 
integration into Europe and the international community, to 
establish cooperation and friendly relations with all those who 
want and respect those values which are so sacred now for all 
the peoples. I believe that to this end have also served the 
visits to Albania by heads of states, prime-ministers and high 
ranking government members from countries of the region, Europe 
and the world. 
  Likewise, the treaties of friendship, agreements of 
economic, 
military, cultural cooperation with many countries have led to a 
closer and greater cooperation of our country with your 
countries, with international institutions and organizations, 
with the European Union, NATO, and other organizations. 
  Naturally, our most serious difficulties during the past 
year 
were poverty and unemployment. But alongside these, the 
contradictions that have arisen from the conflict in Bosnia made 
that old quarrels and grudges reappear on our horizon as well. 
But, it is important to note that we proved to be determined to 
solve disagreements through tolerance, dialogue and 
negotiations, avoiding their aggravation to open conflicts. We 
also proved our resolution to follow a policy of good 
neighborliness and friendship with all those neighbouring and 
non-neighbouring countries that are for such a friendship and 
abide by the same principles as we do. 
  Honourable ambassadors and representatives of international 
institutions and organizations, 
  I would also like to stress that of extremely importance for 
our achievements have been the aid of the countries and 
institutions you represent and your personal commitment to 
realize this aid and cooperation. Therefore I would like to 
express our profound and eternal gratitude to the governments, 
institutions and citizens of the countries you represent for the 
generous aid they have given and are giving to Albania. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, 
  This year Albania is facing serious challenges and 
difficulties. We are optimistic because the all-sided progress 
of the reform during 1993 has restored in the people a great 
faith in it. It has created conditions for us to solve the 
problems for 1994 with success. The reform in our country has 
established closer relations of Albania with the other friendly 
countries and nations. Cooperation with these countries has been 
and will be of primary importance for Albania's integration into 
Europe. 
  Our main objectives for 1994 are related with the 
privatization of large and medium-scale enterprises, creation of 
the market of vouchers, encouragement of foreign investment, 
reduction of unemployment, improvement of infrastructure, 
greater integration of Albania into Europe and international 
institutions, prevention of the conflict in the region and a 
correct solution of the question of the Albanians in Kosova and 
in all former Yugoslavia. All the above are our objectives 
which call for great efforts and support. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, 
  Our road and also others' toward progress and stability has 
become difficult due to Bosnia syndrome. This is the most 
ominous syndrome that has affected our continent since 1945. On 
a local plane it was characterized by an devastating war and 
aggression and an unprecedented genocide. But it is not a local 
syndrome, that is of a single country or region. 
  This syndrome is also international and precisely on the 
international plane it may probably have the most catastrophic 
consequences. In this respect, I would say that Bosnia syndrome 
is a result of the lack of responsibility and loyalty and 
courage of international community to the fundamental principles 
and laws which guarantee order, peace and stability in the 
world. Consequently, it may be also considered as a syndrome of 
complete or partial paralysis of those principles which 
immediately lead to the blocking of international institutions 
(suffice it to mention that out of several resolutions and 
decisions of the Security Council, NATO, and the European Union, 
the embargo is the only one, which has been implemented, though 
not completely). The consequences of this paralysis in a 
long-term future may be extremely disastrous. They may 
encourage and permit the revival of rivalries and ambitions, 
claims of the past, which may gradually replace the spirit of 
cooperation with that of confrontation, and which may lead to 
several consequent conflicts with unprecedented results for us 
and the generations to come. Therefore, let's wish that the 
year 1994 and the NATO summit scheduled for today be a success 
in returning loyalty to the international principles on which is 
based our peace and security, in condemning aggression and 
raising efficiency of international institutions and creating a 
new climate of fostering a close cooperation among Eastern and 
Western countries. 
  In this regard I would like to confirm that we have 
supported 
and continue to support the initiative of "Partnership for 
Peace," but considering it not as a stage of fixed 
classification, but as an active preparatory process for Albania 
and other Eastern countries to become NATO members. In this 
respect I would like to stress that because of Albania's strong 
historic relations with the West and accidental relations with 
Russian factor, its withdrawal from the Warsaw Treaty in the 
60s, its strategic geographic position, the intensive 
cooperation it has already developed with NATO, and because of 
the fact that Albania was the first country to present its 
official request to become a NATO member, undoubtedly this 
request for membership to the alliance deserves to be considered 
first. 
  Wishing once again a good year I want to assure you that 
Albania is and will continue to be ready to develop the spirit 
of understanding, the honest and friendly cooperation with your 
countries and all those countries and institutions that will be 
interested in this. 
  In his greeting on the occasion, the Romanian ambassador in 
Albania, Mr. George Miku, said that diplomatic representatives 
accredited to Tirana note with pleasure that during 1993 
cooperation and relations between the countries and the 
international organizations which they represent and Albania 
have marked new positive developments and a significant progress 
of mutual interest. 
  Mr. Miku said that during this year Albania will make new 
steps regarding the solution of economic problems on the road of 
its integration into the international community. Proceeding 
from the fact that the Albanian nation is equally an old and new 
nation, Mr. Miku expressed his belief that these objectives will 
be realised as soon as possible.

  [Text] Tirana, January 10 (ATA) -- Albanian ministries 
report that significant achievements have been registered in 
many sectors of the economy in 1993. 
  A remarkable development was attained in the sector of 
agriculture. Agricultural and livestock products increased by 
15 per cent. For the first time after 50 years the number of 
livestock per capita was that of 1938, which was considered the 
highest figure for the number of livestock. At present there 
are 3.4 million heads. In 1993, private farmers produced 170 
thousand tons of wheat more than 1992. Ninety three per cent of 
the agricultural land has been privatized. 
  For the first time last year, drilling in the sea were made 
by the oil sector. Horizontal drilling in the land also mark a 
contemporary achievement. Investments were made to restructure 
the electric system. About 100 million dollars have been 
invested during 1993 in the sector of transport and the telecom. 
Twelve agricultural joint ventures were created mainly with 
Greek and Italian partners. The area which these joint ventures 
cover is 10,700 hectares and over 4,600 people have been 
employed in them.

  [Text] Sofia, January 11 (BTA) -- Bulgarian Defence 
Minister Valentin Aleksandrov allegedly handed in his 
resignation last Friday [7 January] after a heated argument with 
the president, 24 CHASA says, quoting an "excellently informed 
source." 
  This move was on the agenda of a cabinet meeting yesterday, 
but the minister withdrew his resignation after a long talk with 
the prime minister. Mr. Aleksandrov neither confirmed nor 
denied the press reports of a row between him and President 
Zhelev. According to the press, the delegation of extraordinary 
powers to the president's military office has provoked the 
scandal. The defence minister did not agree to the army being 
commanded by two authorities, 24 CHASA, says, commenting on the 
possible causes of Mr. Aleksandrov's resignation. According to 
observers, the pressure put on Valentin Aleksandrov was intended 
to wear down his resistance to the replacement of General Lyuben 
Petrov, chief of the General Staff of the Army, 24 CHASA adds. 
  "Zhelev Models Military Office in Royal Fashion," the 
Socialists' daily DUMA says in a frontpage headline. The daily 
also writes about differences between the defence minister and 
President Zhelev on the powers of president's military office.

<F P=106> [From BTA's 12 January "Press Review"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Sofia, January 12 (BTA) -- General Lyuben 
Petrov, chief of General Staff of the Bulgarian Army, helped 
avert a cabinet crisis by persuading Defence Minister Valentin 
Karabashev [title as received] not to tender a resignation, the 
socialist daily DUMA says in a leader. According to the daily 
which cites well-informed but unnamed sources, Defence Minister 
Valentin Karabashev gave up his plan to resign at a closed 
cabinet meeting on Monday [10 January]. His intention was 
caused by a reportedly "scandalous" talk with the president who 
treated the defence chief rudely, DUMA says. "Bulgaria Left With 
no Defence Minister for Three Days," says a headline capping a 
report on the same issue in the private daily STANDART NEWS. 
The daily quotes General Lyuben Petrov as saying the defence 
minister's resignation could trigger a chain reaction destroying 
the entire army administration. "SDS (the Union of Democratic 
Forces) To Ask President for Explanation," DEMOKRATSIYA, the 
daily of the union, headlines its article. The report says that 
according to the National Coordinating Council (the SDS supreme 
leadership), the president's decree on a presidential Military 
Office stirs suspicions of unconstitutionality. The 
parliamentary Movement for Rights and Freedoms (of ethnic Turks) 
will support the SDS, if the latter demands a closed plenary 
sitting where President Zhelev would explain his stand, DUMA 
says. 
  NATO gave the green light to letting in east European 
countries through its Partnership for Peace Initiative. 
Strangely, Bulgaria's name is not mentioned in any of NATO's 
documents," [no opening quotation mark as received] OTECHESTVEN 
VESTNIK, quotes Asparukh Panov, member of the Bulgarian 
parliamentary delegation to the Council of Europe, as saying. 
Mr. Panov lays the blame on Lyuben Berov's cabinet, which 
failed to implement the declaration adopted by parliament late 
last year. In this declaration, the MP's obliged the cabinet to 
do its best to file Bulgaria's candidacy for membership in NATO. 
  Bulgaria's Ambassador to Brussels Lea Koen was late to 
submit 
the National Assembly declaration on membership in NATO. 
Instead of handing the declaration personally to the alliance's 
leadership, she sent it by post, a correspondent of the 
KONTINENT daily in Brussels reports. The daily cites Deputy 
Foreign Minister Todor Churov as saying that right after the 
declaration was adopted, it was given to all Bulgarian 
ambassadors to the NATO member countries. According to the 
procedure, Ambassador Koen had to meet with and hand the 
declaration personally to Manfred Woerner, KONTINENT says. "It 
would be ridiculous and regrettable, if Mrs. Koen really did 
mail the document," Mr. Churov says. 
  President Zhelev asked for Bulgaria's full integration and 
membership in NATO in a letter to the Alliance's Secretary 
General Manfred Woerner on September 27, 1993, i.e., nearly 
three months before parliament discussed Bulgaria's stance on 
relations with NATO and adopted a declaration, reports the 
press. BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] leader Zhan Videnov 
yesterday described this "as a new example of the fait accompli 
policy becoming typical of the president's office," writes DUMA. 
According to 24 CHASA, the Bulgarian Socialist Party sees the 
president's letter as a gaffe manifesting his neglect of 
parliament. KONTINENT reports Mr. Zhelev today will meet with 
"eminent politicians to discuss the visit to Bulgaria on 
Thursday [13 January] of U.S. envoy Madeline Albright."

  [Text] Sofia, January 11 (BTA) -- Forty-five percent of 
the land has been given back to its owners by now, Deputy 
Agriculture Minister Ventsislav Stoyanov told a briefing today 
following a ministry collegium on the 1993 progress of the land 
reform this country. The restituted land is 5 percent down from 
the intended over 50 percent set by the ministry for 1993. 
  A total of 1,027 land division plans were drawn up by 
December 31, 1993. The list of most efficient areas in this 
country is headed by northeastern Bulgaria, while southern 
Bulgaria ranks last, the deputy agriculture minister said. He 
also said that the recent months have witness a speeding up of 
this process. 
  As main stumbling blocks for land restitution the speaker 
pinpointed the shortage of jurists and land-use planners in the 
land commissions, as well as the belated passage of an act to 
regulate the compensation to be granted to the owners who cannot 
have back the whole of their land. The land reform cannot be 
accomplished unless parliament passes this act, Mr. Stoyanov 
stressed. 
  In case the necessary funds are available, the land reform 
can roughly be completed by year's end, Mr. Stoyanov believes. 
According to the ministry's estimates, the land reform needs 
some 800 million leva, which have been envisaged in the 1994 
draft budget. The parliamentary committees are expected to open 
the debates on the draft budget as early as this week.

  [Text] Sofia, January 11 (BTA) -- The leaderships of the 
two major political forces, the former communists' Bulgarian 
Socialist Party (BSP) and the anti-communist Union of Democratic 
Forces (SDS) held regular meetings today to discussed the 
possibility for a closed-door parliamentary sitting to hear 
President Zhelyu Zhelev on the decree regulating the functions 
of his military office, described as exceeding of his powers as 
to the army. The SDS and BSP have considered some other 
parliamentary means as well, high-ranking officials of the two 
parties told a briefing today. The decree was publicized 
following press reports on Friday [7 January]. Dr. Zhelev 
dismissed the allegations that he was exceeding his powers and 
his spokesman accused the parties' headquarters of designing 
backstage schemes. 
  SDS leader Filip Dimitrov stressed that the president's 
decree aroused "certain concerns that structures, identical to 
those existing under the totalitarian regime" were being set up. 
The anti-communist coalition would not react and intends to 
demand the decree, which blew up the scandal, via official 
channels. BSP leader Zhan Videnov described as "unusual" the 
fact that the decree has not so far been published and its text 
is unknown. The Socialists need time to get familiar with the 
issue and put it to discussion. "It is a tradition for the 
President's Office to aim at exceeding its powers, and I am only 
going to cite (the case with) foreign policy, national security 
and the army," Mr. Videnov said at the BSP's regular briefing 
today. 
  The Socialists considered some 7 or 8 ways of reacting to 
this decree, BSP floor leader Nora Ananieva said. She mentioned 
only the one envisaging a hearing of the president either at a 
closed-door parliamentary sitting or at the Parliamentary 
National Security Committee. The Socialist MP's are thinking 
also of asking for the opinion of the defence minister, the 
chief of General Staff and other senior government officers of 
the defence sector. The BSP is expected to come up later with 
one of the 7 variants discussed. 
  It is likely that the Constitutional Court also be 
approached, according to Vasil Gotsev, law graduate and MP of 
the SDS. He told journalists that the decree was 
anticonstitutional. "Indeed, the president is commander in 
chief of the Bulgarian Army, but the Constitution does not 
provide for a body to control it. The Constitution does not say 
that the President's Office should have structures exercising 
control over the army," Mr. Gotsev said.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 10 (CTK) -- Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus 
said on radio tonight that he was most satisfied with the 1993 
rate of inflation which reached 18.2 percent, according to the 
Czech Statistics Office (CSU). Food prices went up by 13 
percent, services by about 20 percent, and public catering 
prices by 20 percent as well, Klaus said. He stressed that the 
overall figure was greatly influenced by the 8 percent price 
growth in January 1993 when a new taxation system was 
introduced. The aggregate price increase for the next 11 months 
was only 10 percent, Klaus pointed out. This means that the 
internal rate of inflation is about 10 percent, the lowest of 
all Eastern European countries and close to the level common in 
Western Europe, Klaus said. The rate of inflation in December 
was 0.8 percent.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 10 (CTK) -- The Czech branch of the 
Greenpeace movement sent an open letter to U.S. President Bill 
Clinton asking him to obstruct guarantees by the U.S. 
Export-Import Bank for completion of the Temelin nuclear plant, 
Greenpeace spokeswoman Vera Frankova told CTK today. The plant 
started to be constructed in 1986, and from the very beginning 
it has been strongly criticized by environmental organizations, 
especially in neighboring Austria. 
  The Czech Government approved the completion of the power 
plant last March, says the letter, handed to the U.S. Embassy to 
the Czech Republic. The American City Bank is willing to grant 
the relevant loan but it requires solid guarantees. According 
to Frankova, the guarantee of 16.2 billion Czech crowns ($540 
million) by the Czech Government was not sufficient, and the 
EX-IM Bank guarantees are also required. The Czech Government 
decided to complete the Temelin, south Bohemia, nuclear plant 
although no study on its impact on the environment has been 
compiled, and no laws on liquidation of nuclear installations, 
storage of radioactive waste, or responsibility for damage 
caused in case of a nuclear accident have been passed, the 
letter claims. Greenpeace believes that Clinton's move against 
completion of the Temelin plant would be entirely in line with 
the environmental aspects of his electoral campaign.

  [Text] Washington, Jan 11 (CTK) -- Czech Premier Vaclav 
Klaus, in an interview with the U.S. television station PBS, 
rejected the view that the transformation of the Czech economy 
is yet to see its hardest period. 
  "It is simply an erroneous analysis, it is not true," Klaus 
said in the interview broadcast Monday [10 January]. He said 
this view is being voiced not only in the Czech Republic but 
often also in other post-communist countries which are slightly 
envious of the results the Czech Republic has achieved. No 
dramatic change as regards unemployment and bankrupts would take 
place, Klaus said, adding that this would be a continual 
process. "We are naturally expecting a certain increase in 
unemployment but it will be tenths of a percent, but not ten 
percent -- the difference between unemployment in the Czech 
Republic and, for example, in Poland," Klaus said. 
  He expressed satisfaction that U.S. President Bill Clinton 
would visit Central Europe and especially Prague. "This is an 
important symbol," Klaus said.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 10 (CTK) -- Latvian Ambassador to the 
Czech Republic Valdis Krastins expressed skepticism Sunday [9 
January] about the Czech Republic's foreign policy as he urged 
the nations of Central and Eastern Europe to take a common stand 
toward NATO membership and European integration. He also joined 
Poland, Hungary, and the Czech and Slovak Republics in calling 
for NATO to offer security guarantees to formerly communist 
countries and a timetable for future membership in the alliance. 
  Krastins emphasized that Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia 
desired to join NATO as their best defense against recent 
Russian imperialist stirrings. Yet he admitted that at the 
moment Latvia could not contribute much to the alliance, and 
consequently accepted the idea of the American "Partnership for 
Peace," which is expected to be approved at the Brussels summit. 
"If the NATO summit does not give us a satisfactory answer, the 
nations of Eastern and Central Europe will have to think of 
their own security arrangements. I think (Polish President) 
Lech Walesa is right. If there is a power vacuum, it will be 
filled, and we know by whom." 
  The countries of Eastern Europe "will be forced to take some 
action by themselves, to establish a sort of regional security 
and economic arrangement, simply for survival." 
  Reflecting this view, the prime ministers of Latvia, 
Lithuania, and Estonia met a few days after the Russian 
elections to discuss a defensive alliance in view of the 
apparent lack of forthcoming security guarantees from NATO. 
Their parliaments also ratified in recent weeks a free trade 
zone agreement among the three countries. 
  The ambassador compared the Baltic defensive alliance to the 
informal Visegrad Group. "History reminds us that we can survive 
economically and politically only by taking a common stand. 
Institutionalizing or not institutionalizing does not play such 
an important role." 
  Krastins added that the current American and West European 
back pedalling since the December 12 Russian elections resembled 
the Western policy of appeasement toward Hitler. "And we all 
know the cost, the tremendous cost that nations had to pay," he 
said. 
  "We are taking (Russian Premier Vladimir) Zhirinovskiy's 
[title as received] threats very seriously because we have been 
reading the history books a very long time," he said, pointing 
out that in the 1920's and '30s no one took Hitler seriously. 
"We are still on the front line because the recent developments 
in Moscow have shown that the dream of a Great Russian empire is 
not dead." 
  The Latvian ambassador praised the Czech Republic's broad 
European outlook, saying this was why Latvia had supported the 
Czech bid last year to become a non-permanent member of the U.N. 
Security Council. Yet he sees the Czech Republic painting 
itself into a corner by attempting to seek its own path to NATO 
and other Western structures. "I see the Czech Republic and the 
Czech Government wanting to go it alone," he said, "not wanting 
to associate itself even with the Visegrad Group, standing a 
little bit aloof and trying to squeeze into Western Europe and 
into NATO alone. It's understandable. But if it does not 
happen, the Czech Republic will be forced to look around (for 
support). As we see it from the Baltics, the Czechs are as 
vulnerable as we, because they have two big neighbors. We have 
only one."

  [Text] Prague, Jan 10 (CTK) -- Czech Industry and Trade 
Minister Vladimir Dlouhy and Bavarian Minister of Economics and 
Transport Otto Wiesheu were not able to agree at their meeting 
today on providing guarantees against so-called acts of God that 
damage the Ingolstadt oil pipeline. Dlouhy said he and Wieshau 
were discussing what was already a second draft of an agreement, 
and that from here on a group of Czech and Bavarian experts 
would work on the problem. 
  Wieshau said Bavaria fully supported the pipeline project, 
but that the Czechs were the party with the primary interest in 
it. Those who own the land over which the pipeline will run want 
to know who will insure them against terrorist attacks, natural 
disasters, or other "acts of God," and it cannot be Bavaria, he 
said. He said a law on pipeline-landowner land rights had been 
worked out in the Bavarian Parliament, but that it needed to be 
passed by the October elections or "we will have to start from 
square one." 
  Construction of the pipeline from the Bavarian town of 
Ingolstadt to Nelahozeves u Kralup in central Bohemia began in 
the Czech Republic in September. Construction of the pipeline 
in Germany is expected to begin this spring. The entire project 
should be completed in 1995, but Wieshau said this depends on 
what happens in the parliament.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 11 (CTK) -- Czech trade union and 
employer groups met respectively yesterday, and reached 
decidedly different judgments regarding the General Agreement 
negotiated by the tripartite (composed of unions, employers, and 
the government) in December. The collective of labor unions 
expressed dissatisfaction with the agreement, while the employer 
collective supported it. 
  (The General Agreement concerns work conditions and 
relationships, wage issues, business conditions, employment, and 
social policy, and is the basic instrument for maintaining 
social peace.) 
  At yesterday's meeting of the Czech-Moravian Chamber of 
Trade 
Unions (CMKOS), labor representatives decided that they would 
not sign the proposal for the General Agreement, calling it a 
basically political declaration which did not guarantee the 
fulfillment of unions' demands. The representatives suggested 
that their social partners in the tripartite (that is, the 
government and employers) were positioning themselves against 
the spirit of the prepared agreement. 
  The CMKOS Board recommended that the union representatives 
negotiate the agreement further, and also drafted a letter with 
concrete suggestions to be sent to Finance Minister Ivan 
Kocarnik, the government's tripartite representative, and to 
employers. 
  However, employers also assembled yesterday at a meeting of 
the Confederation of Employer and Entrepreneurial Unions, and 
expressed a willingness to ratify the agreement. 
  The employers had obtained a request from labor unions, said 
confederation president Jan Fencl, for guarantees protecting 
real wages and their growth, and also for a renegotiation of the 
collective agreement. But according to Fencl, employers cannot 
guarantee real wages because their feasibility depends on the 
progress of economic reform, the development of the 
entrepreneurial environment, and the quality of employees' work. 
  A joint tripartite council had approved the General 
Agreement 
text on December 20, to be then approved by each individual 
social partner. The government approved the agreement last week.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 10 (CTK) -- Out of some 2,000 Bohemian 
and Moravian castles and mansions, 514 were confiscated by the 
end of 1947 under the Benes Decree No. 12 dealing with "landed 
property confiscated from Germans, Hungarians, and traitors and 
enemies of the Czech and Slovak nations." 
  The decree sought to punish those who filed for German or 
Hungarian nationality in 1939 and 1940, served in the German 
Army under the Nazis, or otherwise collaborated with the Germans. 
  In today's article entitled "Czech Seats Claimed Even by 
Descendants of Wehrmacht or SS Servicemen," the left-leaning 
RUDE PRAVO writes that it was under this decree that many of the 
130 castles which have been opened to the public in the 
following two years were acquired by the state. Since November 
1989, over 40 of them have been restituted to the original 
owners' families, and restitution claims have been made for the 
whole or parts of the remaining ones. 
  However, twenty-four claimants, or almost a third, fall into 
the category specified by the Benes Decree. Moreover, the 
property concerned, the paper writes, is of the highest cultural 
value -- such as Rozmberk, Hruby Rohozec, Blatna, Kozel, Opocno, 
Ratiborice, Zleby, and Bouzov Castles -- and there are another 
40 claims to less valuable properties acquired by the state 
under the decree. The most significant claims have been filed 
by the Waldstein, Collorado, Blucher, and Buquoy families as 
well as by the Order of the German Knights. It seems that the 
claimants have agreed on a unified approach, consisting in first 
filing a claim with the regional land registry for both land and 
buildings, and then demanding restitution of land only, under 
the 1993 Land Law, the paper says. 
  Three documents are required by the land registry: A proof 
of 
original ownership, the claimants' Czech nationality, and their 
permanent residence in this country. However, the Interior 
Ministry has been handing out Czech nationality certificates to 
persons of "special importance" irrespective of the laws, and as 
for a permanent residence stamp, it has been shown that this can 
often be obtained without difficulty. The land registry, then, 
is unconcerned whether or not the claimed property was 
confiscated under the Benes Decree -- and a precedent was set 
when the land registry in Semily, east Bohemia, gave 90 hectares 
of land to Karl Walderode, who beyond doubt opted for German 
nationality in 1939 and served in the Wehrmacht. The land 
registry in Ceske Budejovice, south Bohemia, has started 
inquiries into the current state of property a claim to which 
had been filed by Karl Buquoy, the last owner of Rozmberk -- and 
it has done so irrespective of the fact that he is a former SS 
and SA member and that after the war he served a jail term for 
spreading Nazi propaganda. 
  It is clear that the future course of events will be as 
follows: As soon as the Benes Decree-covered claimants receive 
the land, they will file for farm buildings and eventually for 
castles. Under the 1993 Land Law, castles can be considered -- 
strange as it may seem -- as "dwellings forming part of the 
original farming property" and, as such, to be restituted. 
  Judging by the silence of Justice and Interior Ministry 
officials who are aware of all these facts, and by the land 
registries' approach, it appears that the restitution deadline 
of February might be broken and the Benes Decrees rendered 
ineffective. It even seems that by the attitude they have 
taken, government institutions are giving this development free 
rein, RUDE PRAVO writes.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 11 (CTK) -- To enhance peace and 
security the Czech Republic should "conclude treaties of 
friendship and peaceful cooperation.... mainly with powers such 
as the United States, Germany, France, Great Britain, and 
Russia," Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM) says in a 
letter addressed to U.S. President Bill Clinton and given to CTK 
today. 
  "Our experiences show that it is not the question of joint 
military exercises or the presence of foreign troops on our 
territory but genuine cooperation in the interest of peace, 
security, democracy, and economic prosperity which should be 
embedded in these treaties," the letter says. To fulfill these 
goals "collective consultative mechanisms of all countries 
concerned" should be strengthened. 
  Employees of the U.S. Embassy in Prague told CTK they could 
not confirm whether the letter was received by the embassy since 
"there were many letters addressed to the President." However, 
they said that Clinton would certainly get all the 
correspondence addressed to him. 
  KSCM Chairman Miroslav Grebenicek writes in the letter that 
communists recall with pleasure Clinton's first informal visit 
in Prague in 1970 where he stayed in his friend's house "with 
the family of hero of anti-fascist resistance and renowned 
left-oriented politician Jan Sverma." 
  From the position of one of the strongest Czech opposition 
parties the communists express their stand on Clinton's 
forthcoming talks in Prague and stress that the interests of the 
Czech Republic' security, sovereignty, national identity, and 
economic prosperity are their prime concern. 
  However, unlike official representatives, the communists do 
not believe that membership of NATO is the road to implementing 
these goals. "We have very bad experiences with the Europe of 
Cold War and military pacts" the letter stresses.

  [Text] Prague, January 7 (CTK) -- A new conception of the 
future position of Romanies in society has been presented to 
Czech President Vaclav Havel in an open letter from Brno 
businessman Milan Scuka, vice president of the International 
Romany Union and president of the Civic Association for Romany 
Culture and Press. In the letter, entitled "Romanies are 
Citizens with Obligations Only, and No Rights," Scuka analyses 
the problems of Romanies within the framework of European 
integration. He believes that reform has to take place both in 
social opinions, which should take into account Romany interests 
and their position within the European Community, and in the 
finding of a solution to Romany problems. 
  This solution should be based on a new orientation, issuing 
in part from Christian philosophy and the Romany culture in 
Europe as an essential basis for the broadening of the Romany 
educational level. It would require the international Romany 
Union to cooperate with all the international and church 
organizations, with the leaders of Romany organizations and 
parties, and with Romany intellectuals in Europe. There is a 
need for an educational and cultural center or community which 
would act in individual European states and regions and help 
Romanies to find their own identity and to be not only good 
Romanies but capable citizens, Scuka says. 
  The Czech Republic lacks a sound legal means of suppressing 
racism and objective statistics on the social position of 
Romanies, Scuka says in the letter, and also suggests that the 
president have a Romany adviser in his office.

told a press conference at the Foreign Ministry today. The 
leaders of the 16 permanent-NATO-member countries opened the 
road for filling the security policy vacuum in the region, and 
promised that the countries accepted now as partners would be 
admitted to NATO as full members later. The minister said that, 
after a long wait, the problems, security and future of 
East-Central Europe have again come into the focus of western 
interest. Jeszenszky denied that Russia or the Pacific rim 
would squeeze out this region from American thinking. He 
recalled that yesterday President Clinton confirmed U.S. 
commitment to Europe, saying that Central Europe was of vital 
interest for the United States. 
  What the NATO summit and tommorrow's meeting in Prague 
between Clinton and the leaders of the Visegrad countries offer 
is not the reconstruction of an iron curtain somewhat east of 
the old one. The NATO summit promised more: Partnership 
offered for Russia is a reassuring solution even for the smaller 
East-Central European states. 
  Hungarian diplomacy regards the Partnership for Peace scheme 
as a straight road to NATO. The scheme itself is an enormous 
step forward and we have no reason to underestimate this, the 
Hungarian foreign minister said. Partnership for peace promises 
a chance of consultation for the countries accepted as partners. 
The consultations can be regarded as a kind of guarantee. So 
can the fact that NATO is prepared to connect its security with 
that of East Central Europe, he said. Hungary is aware that the 
road to full NATO membership is long. We are prepared to take 
part in the evolutionary process of partnership for peace. 
Hungary's security policy-makers now face the fundamental 
questions of when and how, Jeszenszky said. 
  This afternoon the Hungarian foreign minister is to leave 
for 
Prague, where U.S. President Clinton will meet tomorrow with 
heads of state and foreign ministers of the Visegrad countries 
(Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia). Jeszenszky 
feels that the forthcoming meeting will strengthen cooperation 
between the Central European states, something to which Hungary 
has attributed great importance since 1989. 
  From Prague, the Hungarian foreign minister will leave on 
Friday [14 January] for Warsaw, to meet with his Polish 
counterpart and survey topical issues of bilateral relations. 
They will also discuss the latest international developments in 
the region, and tasks stemming from the Brussels summit of NATO 
and the Prague summit of the Visegrad countries. 
  Replying to questions, Jeszenszky said that, due to the 
considerations of the Czech premier, the participants would not 
issue a joint statement on the Prague talks, but the protocols 
to be drawn up on the bilateral meetings will include everything 
that a common protocol signed by all parties would have 
contained. Asked about Slovakia's role in the Visegrad 
cooperation, Jeszenszky said, "although this cooperation would 
work even without Slovakia, it would be much more effective with 
its participation." He lauded the Slovak prime minister's recent 
assertions of the western orientation of his country.

  [Excerpt] Budapest, Jan 11 (CTK) -- The chairman of the 
Office for Hungarians Abroad, Geza Entz, has rejected the 
accusation that the January 8 meeting of ethnic Hungarian 
representatives in southern Slovakia was initiated by Hungary's 
foreign policy. 
  In an interview for today's Hungarian daily PESTI HIRLAP, 
Entz said that the Slovak Government circles would point to 
their neighbor as long as cooperation between Bratislava and 
Budapest is not established in order to settle the position of 
the 560,000-strong Hungarian ethnic minority in Slovakia. 
  In a declaration approved at the meeting, participants 
demanded the expansion of the jurisdiction of local government 
and a new local administrative arrangement in Slovakia. 
  Entz said that documents approved in Komarno, southern 
Slovakia, over the weekend clearly prove that it is not 
reasonable to accuse the mayors of the southern Slovak region 
(at whose initiative the meeting was held) of being separatist 
only because they rejected as unacceptable state administration 
reform. At the meeting, ethnic Hungarians peacefully but 
resolutely formulated their demands which aim at preservation of 
national identity and their eventual recognition by the Slovak 
Government circles as partners. 
  After the submission of the claims of an "extensive stratum 
of society," said Entz, he believed there existed a hope of 
resolving the standing of Hungarians in Slovakia legally.

<F P=106> [From the "Press Review"] </F>
  [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 11 -- Poland's national dailies on 
Tuesday give extensive coverage to the Jan. 10 NATO summit in 
Brussels at which the leaders of the 16-nation North Atlantic 
Treaty Organisation (NATO) agreed to endorse the U.S.-proposed 
"Partnership for Peace" proposal, that will draw East European 
states closer to NATO but without granting them full membership. 
  "GAZETA WYBORCZA" headlines its front-page report with the 
words "Partnership for the Sake of Peace" and devotes two pages 
of commentaries to the issue. In a commentary entitled "Let's 
Consummate This Concubinage", Former Deputy Defence Minister 
Przemyslaw Grudzinski states that what happened in Brussels is 
not a historic event because key decisions concerning the future 
of NATO, that is, automatically linking the U.S. proposal with 
NATO membership, have not been taken. He claims, however, that 
"Poland's interest requires to join the programme." 
  He argues that Poland has outpaced other countries at the 
start to "Partnership for Peace" and is ready to meet 
"effectively the proposal's tasks, including "clearly defined" 
military budget, civilian control over the Defence Ministry, 
joint military planning and military training with NATO plus the 
tradition and experience in peace-keeping operations." 
  Alluding to the metaphor included in the title, Grudzinski 
states that "this is not a marriage yet, merely a concubinage. 
At stake is that the present ruling political forces in Poland 
wanted this concubinage and rapidly consummated it." 
  In concluding remarks, Grudzinski concedes that it is not 
easy to leap from exclusive NATO into a general security system 
that embraces everyone. The road from the system of divided 
security to the system of indivisible security has been "taken 
step by step, through gradual enlargement of the area of stable 
and democratic states." 
  Other Polish dailies greet the news from Brussels with pages 
of stories and commentaries. 
  "RZECZPOSPOLITA" announces the endorsement of the 
"Partnership for Peace" proposal in huge type and leads with a 
few stories on its front page summing up the results of the 
first day of the NATO summit in the article entitled "We Will 
Not Leave You Alone" and describing a reaction of President Lech 
Walesa and Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak in their terse 
statement "this is an insufficient leap in the right direction." 
  The NATO summit meeting is also widely covered and commented 
upon on the front page of the left-wing "TRYBUNA". The headline 
over the article about the government's decision to join the 
U.S. proposal reads "Beneficial but Insufficient". The paper's 
journalists write about the NATO decisions in an article under 
the ironic title "The Hole to the NATO Key", while "TRYBUNA" 
editor-in-chief Dariusz Szymczycha says in his commentary that 
"Poland is not the `Christ of nations' and has not been given a 
bonus for leadership in overthrowing communism. Instead, high 
expectations have been set before Poland. A perspective has 
been outlined, but no promises have been made. This is the 
reality one has to reckon with." 
  Piotr Bazylko writes in a commentary in the "ZYCIE WARSZAWY" 
daily that "the Polish Government has been forced to participate 
in the U.S. "Partnership for Peace" programme and quotes Foreign 
Minister Andrzej Olechowski as saying that Poland is in the 
"corridor" of NATO. "The fact that Poland has not been admitted 
to NATO means that the process of our integration with the West 
will be slower," Bazylko contends.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 8 -- When asked whether his government 
would continue the reform of the public administration started 
by the Hanna Suchocka cabinet, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak 
said during a meeting with regional press newsmen Saturday that 
it would rather be "streamlining than reforming." 
  The prime minister criticized work on the district reform, 
stressing that the communes had not been consulted at all on 
whether districts were to be established. He said his cabinet 
was not aiming at the centralization of power and also stressed 
that the point was not to "centrally" shift responsibility on 
local governments. 
  Pawlak denied press statements according to which his 
cabinet 
sent an expert analysis of the concordat signed by the previous 
government to the Secretariat of Poland's Episcopate. He 
stressed the government was not conducting any work on the 
document. 
  Asked about possible changes at the posts of deputy 
ministers 
in the so-called presidential ministries, namely, the Ministries 
of Internal Affairs, National Defence and Foreign Affairs, the 
prime minister said the issue aroused too strong emotions. 
  The prime minister also announced actions designed to limit 
the so-called grey zone.

Ukraine, who in his government is responsible for the

  Deputy Prime Minister Shmarov, who led the Ukrainian 
delegation at the talks held in Washington concerning the 
regulating of the nuclear weapons issue in Ukraine, briefed his 
interlocutor about the agreements reached. During the course of 
the conversation with Minister Milewski he suggested closer 
Polish-Ukrainian cooperation in restructuring the arms industry 
in both countries. Minister Milewski expressed the hope that 
the proposed, by the Ukrainian side, visit of the minister of 
national defence of the Polish Republic to Ukraine will be a 
good opportunity to discuss the above mentioned issues, the BBN 
statement says.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 11/01/1994 -- Petre Roman, the 
president of the Democratic Party (PD) and head of the 
Commission for Defense, Public Order and National Security of 
the Romanian Chamber of Deputies (lower house of the 
parliament), said on Tuesday [11 January] in a statement that 
the NATO summit in Brussels did not bring any surprise as the 
American proposal of Partnership for Peace was adopted. 
  This result can be considered as disappointing for all the 
former members of the Warsaw Treaty including Romania, said 
Petre Roman. In the present context of the European security, 
Romania considers itself entitled to a larger and more assuring 
status with regard to its national security. 
  Petre Roman said the Partnership for Peace represented a 
compromise between two recent tendencies in Europe: On one 
side, the direct and strong request for NATO membership by the 
former socialist countries as they do not feel safe because of 
the revival of imperialist tendencies in Russia where the 
democratic process is far from being a firmly established 
reality and, on the other side, the very insistent, even tough 
request of Russia that NATO extending should not take place. 
  In front of the revival of certain hegemonic tendencies, of 
certain strategies of spheres of influence, Romania cannot feel 
secure as long as it has not found its natural place in the 
Western world which means its NATO membership, PD leader Petre 
Roman said. 
  Petre Roman appreciated as very important the fact that the 
United States had warned that if militarist and expansionist 
tendencies continued in Russia, the NATO would proceed to its 
enlargement toward the countries in the Central and Eastern 
Europe, including Romania.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 11/01/1994 -- Tudor Postelnicu, 
the former minister of the interior of the Ceausescu regime, 
will be released on parole for a period of six months, after a 
Bucharest military court rule on 10 January. His lawyer 
appealed for Postelnicu's temporary release from prison after 
producing as evidence a medical certificate proving that the 
former top communist dignitary was suffering from eight severe 
diseases requesting surgical intervention. 
  Tudor Postelnicu is part of the group of former high 
dignitaries under the Ceausescu regime -- together with Emil 
Bobu, Ion Dinca and Manea Manescu -- arrested shortly after 
Ceausescu's runaway, who were put on trial on 27 January 1990. 
  After a military court convicted him to life imprisonment 
under a genocide crime on 2 February 1990, the Supreme Court of 
Justice accepted an extraordinary appeal on 26 April 1993, 
changing the charge to complicity at aggravated murder and 
complicity at attempted aggravated murder. The sentences were: 
17 years of imprisonment for Tudor Postelnicu, 15 years for Ion 
Dinca, 10 years each for Emil Bobu and Manea Manescu. The court 
also ruled for the first three to be stripped of their military 
ranks. 
  Tudor Postelnicu is the second former top communist 
dignitary 
that was granted a release on parole in the past two weeks, 
after ex-general Iulian Vlad, the former head of the Securitate, 
released at the end of 1993 after serving one third of his 
sentence.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 10/01/1994 -- "We will 
permanently take steps in order to bring to the executive the 
best people, with initiative and an organizing ability, people 
that should boost the whole process of reforms in Romania", said 
on January 10 Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu. 
  Answering journalists' question about a possible government 
reshuffle, Nicolae Vacaroiu said "the results of the activity of 
some ministers and secretaries of state in this process of 
transition" would be scrutinized. He opined that the scrutiny 
"will disclose the way how they fulfill their duties". "The 
government reshuffle will be to my mind a permanent target of 
the executive's activity", the Romanian premier added. 
  Romania's Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu told on Monday the 
press accredited to the Victoria Palace the his executive team 
planned to implement in the first part of the year a set of 
measures in the financial, monetary, currency and economic 
fields aiming to recover macro-economic equilibrium. Among 
them, the Romanian premier mentioned the bankruptcy bill, the 
public finance bill and the stock exchange bill. The government 
has considered also drafting decisions aiming to strengthen the 
discipline of the economic agents. 
  The prime minister said the set of bills was much larger as 
it targeted not only the economic field but also other fields 
just as important: science, education, culture, justice, 
defense. 
  In the context, the premier said that inflation would make 
"a 
slight jump" in the first part of the current year. The rate of 
inflation would be 7-9 percent in the first 3-4 month and then, 
because of the measures which would have been implemented, the 
macro-economic stabilization would probably start and the 
inflation would slow down to 3-5 percent in the second part of 
the year.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 11/01/1994 -- Romania's atomic 
programme will be operational starting December 1994, when unit 
one of the Atomic Station of Cernavoda is connected to the 
national electrical network, Anton Dragomirescu, head of the 
National Commission for Atomic Activities Surveillance told the 
press a few days ago. He added that a date had been given for 
the first kw to be supplied by Cernavoda, namely December 24, 
1994. Unit one will have 700 kw installed power, of which 660 
kw for the national network and 40 kw for its own consumption. 
Dragomirescu mentioned that according to foreign partners the 
Cernavoda Nuclear Station met all the IAEA requirements, so that 
a Chernobyl-like accident is out of question. 
  The whole complex at Cernavoda, the biggest investment in 
Romania so far, will finally have five groups of reactors of 
Candu-type (Canada Deuterium Uranium), apt to yield about 30 
percent of Romania's energy necessities. 
  Official demarches were made in Romania as early as 1965 for 
the construction of an atomic station. Economic-technical 
studies were drafted starting 1968 and offers compared from the 
Soviet Union, Germany and Canada. Political "reasons" and 
especially the shortage of funds made the conclusion of a 
contract with the atomic energy of Canada, AEC, possible only in 
1978. The Canadians were chosen as Romania could produce 
Uranium-based fuel at Pitesti and heavy water at Drobeta Turnu 
Severin. In addition, Candu reactors have proved a high 
security level in keeping with international requirements. 
According to schedule, the power station should have started 
production in 1985, but it was again the shortage of funds that 
was responsible for the delay. The contract with AECL and 
ANSALDO -- an Italian partner for the installation of the 
classical parts of the station -- expired. The investment was 
halted soon after December 1989. 
  A new contract between the power utility RENEL and the 
AECL-ANSALDO consortium was concluded in 1991, stipulating 
supervision of the building of reactor one, re-building of 
reactor two, preservation of units 3,4 and 5. A new stage will 
be December 1994 when unit one starts operation, to be followed 
by the commercial exploitation of the station for 18 months. 
All this is going to be paralleled by the training of Romanian 
personnel in Canada. The contract was accompanied by two 
credits, by a Canadian Bank and an Italian one respectively, 
totalling $410 million. 
  It is worth mentioning that a change has been made in the 
atomic programme, with efforts concentrated on unit one, with 
unit two scheduled to be completed in 1995 and the other three 
between 1997 and 1999, while the groups under operation supply 
money necessary for construction.

  [Text] Bratislava, January 11 (CTK) -- The omission of 
Slovakia from the countries cited by both German Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl and British Prime Minister John Major as eagerly 
awaiting NATO membership is a warning signal for the Slovak 
Government, Democratic Left Party (SDL) Chairman Peter Weiss 
said today. Major had said that the Czech Republic, Poland, and 
Hungary were the Central European countries with the 
fastest-developing democracies and the clearest demands for NATO 
membership. Weiss said this meant the Slovak Government needed 
to analyze the country's situation, since forgetting about or 
directly minimizing Slovakia could lead to the destabilization 
of the Central European region. 
  In connection with the demands of Hungarian minority leaders 
formulated on January 8 at the meeting in Komarno, SDL deputy 
and Council of Europe parliament representative Lubomir Fogas 
pointed to the closing document of the Vienna summit of October 
8-9 last year, which charged a committee of ministers with 
drawing up a proposal for a supplement to the European Agreement 
on Human Rights in the area of culture and individual rights, 
especially the rights of national minority members. 
  This supplement, Fogas said, spoke unequivocally about the 
solution of minority problems on the basis of the individual 
rights of citizens, as declared by the Slovak Constitution. The 
Komarno meeting had overstepped the framework of this 
recommendation, he said. 
  The division of the country for administration is not a 
matter of parcelling up land, but is an act which should use 
social, economic, demographic, transport, and other analyses and 
should not be limited merely to the national minority side of 
the question, Fogas said. He added that the decentralization of 
state power would be debated at Slovak Parliament's 26th session 
at the end of January.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 11 (CTK) -- "Absolutely no doubts 
can emerge" regarding Slovakia's interest in joining NATO, 
Slovak Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik told Slovak Radio today. 
"I do not think at all that our interest in joining NATO is 
less intensive than the interest of the other Visegrad Group 
countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland). Many times, on 
every occasion we clearly showed our interest," Moravcik said. 
He was reacting to the fact that British Prime Minister John 
Major and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had omitted Slovakia 
when listing the countries which have come closest to NATO 
membership. 
  "I would not overestimate the reach of such statements. At 
personal talks with the politicians who had omitted naming 
Slovakia, we were always assured that Slovakia was counted on as 
the other Visegrad countries.... We really do not have the 
least reason to consider Slovakia a less prepared partner," 
Moravcik emphasized. He said that the Slovak Government was 
ready to sign the Partnership for Peace initiative, and a 
special group of officials from the Foreign and Defense 
Ministries would be soon created to prepare the special 
agreement and its realization. 
  Asked whether or not he would discuss the question of 
Slovakia's Hungarian minority with his Hungarian counterpart at 
their meeting in Prague, Moravcik said that the problem could be 
mentioned only in connection with Slovakia's efforts to work out 
a pan-European document, because the question of the minority 
status was Slovakia's internal affair. 
  The Slovak delegation to meet with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton on the occasion of his Prague meeting with 
representatives of the Visegrad Four will include President 
Michal Kovac, Premier Vladimir Meciar, Moravcik, Deputy Premiers 
Jozef Prokes, Sergej Kozlik, and Julius Toth, Economics Minister 
Jan Ducky, Health Minister Irena Belohorska, Foreign Ministry 
State Secretary Jan Lisuch, Slovak Ambassador to the Czech 
Republic Ivan Mjartan, and the Slovak ambassador designate to 
the United States, Branislav Lichardus. At a government session 
today, Moravcik said that Slovakia wanted to use the Prague 
meeting with Clinton to express again its interest in NATO 
membership, and to present a proposal to intensify Slovak-U.S. 
economic relations.

  [Text] Kosice, east Slovakia, Jan 10 (CTK) -- Chairmen of 
the ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) east Slovak 
branches voiced concern this weekend over Slovak President 
Michal Kovac's new year's speech. 
  In a letter, approved over the weekend and published in full 
by today's eastern Slovak pro-government daily LUC, HZDS leading 
officials recall that Kovac ran for the 1992 parliamentary 
elections to the former Czechoslovak Parliament on the HZDS east 
Slovakia branch's slate. They accept with understanding the 
suspension of Kovac's HZDS membership (as long as he holds the 
post of Slovak president), but with "less understanding" the 
establishment of a corps of the president's advisers filling the 
President's Office, the letter says. 
  "We were disquieted at your (Kovac's) new year's speech in 
which among other things you urged political entities 
(fortunately there are not many of them in parliament) to form a 
broad coalition. Unfortunately you did so only on a general 
level which did not address anyone," reads the letter. 
  The HZDS functionaries ask him whether or not those who 
refused to vote for the adoption of the Constitution and the 
Declaration of Slovakia's Sovereignty, who formed new groups in 
parliament, call for early elections, and "question each of the 
present government's steps every day" are also among those to be 
represented in the coalition he proposes. 
  "Our questions require clear answers. A general appeal which 
can only further destabilize the political scene and give the 
executive power again to those who failed to gain it in the 
regular (1992) democratic elections is not sufficient," says the 
letter, which LUC says was also signed by four HZDS deputies of 
the National Council of the Slovak Republic.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 10 (CTK) -- The open letter by some 
leaders of the governing Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
(HZDS) cannot be considered the official position of the HZDS, 
Ivana Salczerova, a spokesman for the HZDS, told CTK today. 
  The letter, signed by four HZDS deputies and leaders of east 
Slovak HZDS branches and published today in the pro-government 
regional daily LUC, opposes President Michal Kovac's proposal to 
form a broad coalition government. 
  The letter questions the right of those who in the past had 
refused to vote for the current Constitution (the Christian 
Democratic Movement and ethnic Hungarian parties), created new 
groups of deputies (former Foreign Minister Milan Knazko who 
formed 8-deputy strong Alliance of Slovak Democrats), and who 
called for early elections (Democratic Left Party). 
  Salczerova said that it was common for regional leaders to 
send an open letter to a state official or to issue a 
declaration after their meeting. The open letter has not been 
consulted with the nationwide HZDS leadership, she added.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 9 (CTK) -- Slovak Parliament 
Chairman Ivan Gasparovic praised the fact that at yesterday's 
meeting of ethnic Hungarian representatives, held by the 
Association of Towns and Villages of Zitny Island (ZMOZO) in 
Komarno, participants retreated from the association's original 
demands, Slovak Radio reported today. 
  In the declaration approved at the meeting, participants 
demand expanding the jurisdiction of local government and a new 
territorial-administrative arrangement in Slovakia. 
Representatives of the Hungarian minority are asking for either 
one territorial-administrative unit stretching from Bratislava 
to Kosice or three separate units. Either variant would give 
ethnic Hungarians a significant majority in those regions. 
  Meeting participants also demanded that the rights of the 
Hungarian minority be anchored in the Slovak Constitution, 
stating that they consider the use of Hungarian as an official 
language everywhere that Hungarians make up at least one-tenth 
of the population to be vital for the development of the 
Hungarian community. 
  A 1991 census in Slovakia found that more than 600,000 
Hungarians -- 11.5 percent of the population -- live in 
Slovakia. They are represented in 522 towns and villages. 
Almost 98 percent of all ethnic Hungarians in Slovakia live in 
the region along Slovakia's southern border, where they make up 
close to 70 percent of the population.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 7 (CTK) -- There is no open problem 
between Slovakia and Israel, Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik 
told journalists on his return from a five-day visit to Israel 
and Cyprus. The Slovak delegation included Economics Minister 
Jan Ducky, Governor of the National Bank of Slovakia Vladimir 
Masar, and a number of businessmen. 
  During his three-day stay in Israel, Moravcik met with his 
Israeli counterpart, the Israeli premier, president and the 
speaker of the Knesset, the Israeli parliament. 
  The Slovak balanced diplomatic activity is aimed at 
"creating 
throughout the region equal opportunities and room for 
cooperation," Moravcik said, adding, "one of the prerequisites 
for this is the implementation of the peace agreement between 
Israel and the Palestinians." 
  In order to further bilateral cooperation, agreements on the 
prevention of double taxation and protection of investments have 
to be signed, he said. 
  His visit to Israel focused on the extension of political 
dialogue, bilateral trade, and areas of prospective cooperation. 
These are envisaged as agriculture, banking, travel industry, 
and Israeli investment in Slovakia. "The first stage of 
building bilateral ties logically culminated in this visit," 
Moravcik said.

communique which says: 
  1. The Provisional Steering Committee held recently meetings 
with representatives of the branches in diaspora. It was 
decided to carry out changes in the fold of the DPP without 
making compromise with the forces that failed, betrayed or tried 
to brainwash Albanian population to accept foreign power.

completion. Extraordinary assemblies of the branches of Tetova, 
Gostivar and Struga will be held within the week. The activity 
will [words indistinct] the Provisional Steering Committee of 
the DPP. 
  3. The Provisional Steering Committee, as the only executive 
political organ of the DPP, tried to contact some of the DPP 
deputies who were members of the self-styled committee for the 
convocation of the congress but without success, because these 
deputies play the game of the self-styled arbiters of the DPP. 
  4. To inform the newsmen and Albanian editorial boards and 
newspapers that the provisional steering committee elected by 
the assembly of Gostivar is the only provisional political 
executive organ of the DPP until the convocation of the

convocation of the congress. 
  5. According to the results of elections in the DPP 
branches, we inform the public that the congress will be held 
late January 1994.

observers in Kosova, stationing of peace-keeping forces in the

  Bukoshi observes that lack of immediate action in this

  [Excerpts] Visegrad group prime ministers held bilateral 
meetings in Hrzan Palace in Prague. Ilona Dienstbierova covered 
their talks. 
  [Dienstbierova] [passage omitted] I will recall briefly the 
bilateral talks between Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and 
Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar. The Slovak prime minister 
commented on the initial conditions of the countries that are to 
join the Partnership for Peace plan. 
  [Begin Meciar recording] We are equal in a political and 
legal sense, but not in reality. We are not equal in terms of 
the geopolitical situation and economic development. As far as 
the state and the level of building the Armed Forces is 
concerned, we are not on the same level either. That is why the 
Partnership for Peace, as a contractual principle and as a 
blueprint for doing things, is creating an opportunity and is 
initiating a certain process. The development of this process 
could take place (?on an individual basis). At the same time, 
the course of this process cannot be determined at present. 
This means that its outcome might be quite different, 
irrespective of the fact that things may appear to be a 
certainty today. 
  Thus, the Partnership for Peace plan has opened up a process 
which, we think, is providing an opportunity for us. Even 
though not all of us are on the same level as we stand here on 
the starting line, there is no way we can forecast as yet what 
the results will be. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Talks with the Slovak President Michal Kovac 
concluded the series of bilateral meetings between U.S. 
President Bill Clinton and the highest representatives of 
Visegrad Group countries that were held in the course of this 
morning. 
  Talks with Hungarian President Arpad Goncz, Polish President 
Lech Walesa, and Slovak President Michal Kovac took place in the 
U.S. Embassy in Prague. These talks were a followup of Bill 
Clinton's talks with President Vaclav Havel and other Czech 
Republic representatives yesterday. During the talks with the 
delegations of the four Visegrad countries, President Clinton 
emphasized the importance of the Partnerhip for Peace plan as a 
path designed to promote these countries' integration into 
Western structures and prepare them for admission into NATO 
later. Expansion of technical assistance and Western 
investments into these states was another important topic of the 
talks. 
  The bilateral talks will be followed by a working lunch 
given 
by President Clinton for the presidents, premiers, and foreign 
ministers of Visegrad countries. A short statement for the 
press is expected after the meeting. Before he departs from 
Prague, the U.S. President will take part in a discussion about 
privatization and the prospects of Czech-U.S. trade in the 
department store K-Mart.

  [Excerpts] U.S. President Bill Clinton gave a working lunch 
in the embassy in Prague today for the three-member delegations 
of the four Visegrad Group states. [passage omitted] Clinton 
summed up the outcome of the meeting after the lunch. He was 
followed by Vaclav Havel, who spoke on behalf of the Visegrad 
Group. Vaclav Havel said: 
  [Begin Havel recording] We are living in a time of dramatic 
search for a new order, in which no one will be subjugated or 
endangered, and which will enable all European peoples and 
states to enjoy an atmosphere of peaceful cooperation. 
  Our meeting in Prague today is proof that the United States 
of America and NATO are well aware of the great importance that 
stability, security and peace in central Europe have for peace 
throughout Europe and for the security of the United States. 
  We welcome the Partnership for Peace proposal as a good 
point 
of departure in NATO's quest for a new identity as a true 
stabilizing core of European security. We also appreciate that 
Partnership for Peace allows individual approaches to different 
countries. At the same time it rests with individual countries 
on just how powerfully and quickly they move to give Partnership 
for Peace a content that meets its interests and possibilities. 
  We want to do our utmost to ensure that our partnership will 
result in full NATO membership because we do not see it as a 
substitute but as a first step toward joining NATO. We want to 
join NATO because we share the civilization values it protects, 
and because we want to take part in their protection. 
  We are well aware that it is neither possible nor desirable 
to isolate Russia. We are, however, independent states, and we 
decide ourselves about our affiliations and our orientation. 
  As we agreed during conversations with the representatives 
of 
central European nations, those who are taking part in this 
meeting in Prague, our countries have very similar views on the 
issues I have just mentioned. This surely is a gratifying 
circumstance, and it is to the benefit of us all. 
  In closing, please allow me to express my firm belief that 
this gathering has become an important landmark on the road to 
the new, democratic and truly peaceful Europe, sharing firm and 
natural ties with the North American continent. 
  The city of Yalta went down in history as a symbol of the 
division of Europe. I would be happy if today, the city of 
Prague could emerge as a symbol of Europe standing in alliance.

  [Text] We have just received the text of the speech of 
Arpad Goncz, Hungarian head of state. Arpad Goncz considers it 
important that all those states which make efforts for the 
assertion of democracy, market economy, and human rights should 
be allowed to join the Partnership for Peace program. The 
president of the Hungarian Republic spoke at a working lunch in 
Prague, attended by the leaders of the United States and 
Visegrad countries. The head of state also pointed out that 
neither Russia, Ukraine, or any other state of the region can be 
excluded from the European security systems. 
  According to Arpad Goncz, President Bill Clinton's talks in 
Prague prove that the United States continues to be committed to 
Europe and the democracies of the Visegrad Group.

for over 24 hours. The main objective of his stay in Prague was 
to acquaint us and the neighboring countries with the results of 
the NATO Brussels summit, with the Partnership for Peace project. 
  All countries that took part in this meeting confirmed their 
interest in this project and expressed their readiness to start 
to implement it immediately. This means that various 
delegations will be coming soon and relevant protocols about 
cooperation in various areas will be prepared. 
  President Clinton emphasized on several occasions, at 
various 
talks the importance of stability, peace, and security in 
central Europe, for Europe as a whole, and also for United Staes 
security. I personally see this visit as very successful. 
President Clinton also said something similar because this 
project was received by the central European countries with 
understanding. It, however, must be said that all central 
European countries emphasized they understood this [project] 
only as a first step on the way to the full NATO membership. 
The U.S. side took this with full understanding and assured us 
that this was indeed the path on which it was possible to reach 
full membership. The speed with which this project will be 
changed into full NATO membership depends on individual 
countries, their internal stability, their possibilities, their 
potential, and many other circumstances. 
  Naturally, during the official talks of the delegations, 
during the multilateral lunch, and also on other less official 
occasions, we spoke about various matters, including economic 
cooperation. The main objective of this visit was, however, 
what I have described earlier. 
  [Czech Radio correspondent] Mr. President, to what extent is 
the project Partnership for Peace done to meet our dreams, 
ideas, and aspirations? To what extent does it contain specific 
guarantees of us being integrated in the sphere of Euro-American 
influence, and to what extent is this accommodating attitude 
toward this project a matter of inner convictions of the 
representatives of the Visegrad countries? Finally, to what 
extent is it the realization that there is no other way? 
  [Havel] All those countries which took part in this meeting 
stressed that they did not want to join the North Atlantic 
Alliance only in order to have as smaller countries some allies 
and formal guarantees of their security. This application means 
something deeper. It means subscribing to certain civilization 
values which the North Atlantic Alliance is protecting. It also 
means a will to take an active part in protecting such values. 
Those specific areas in which protocols on cooperation are to 
be concluded and which this project contains are generally 
expressed in the final communique issued by the NATO summit in 
Brussels, which surely you shall have or which you already have 
at your disposal. During the discussions on these matters this 
issue was developed in a somewhat more specific detail. 
  It is clear that this project as such does not contain 
formalized security guarantees; rather, as it emerged from all 
the discussions it is in fact a some kind of a degree of 
security guarantees or let us say a first step to security 
guarantees. It contains, for instance, the clause about 
consultations 16 plus one. This means that if a country feels 
threatened it has the right of consulting its situation with the 
Alliance and it depends on the assessment of both partners what 
consequences it might eventually have. 
  [Holec, Czech News Agency] Mr. President, to what extent did 
opinions of [words indistinct] Visegrad differ? President 
Walesa's address at the working lunch, from what I have seen, 
was very critical. President Walesa was saying that, at least 
according to that speech, the Partnership for Peace is somewhere 
halfway. Could you tell us more about the differences in 
opinions as well as President Walesa's stance? 
  [Havel] The important fact is that these four countries, and 
that was in the interest of the American side as well, gave 
their support to this project, accepted it, and expressed their 
readiness to work on it. Of course, stances of some individual 
delegations differed. In the stance taken by the Polish 
delegation there emerged some kind of a basic formula that this 
is a step in the right direction but a small one. 
  We do not share this view. I personally believe that this 
was the only possible step [to be taken] by the alliance, that 
it is a well-balanced, well thought out step. If I pose any 
questions to myself it is only the question why this step had 
not been taken one or two years ago. 
  Poland has different historical experience. It is more 
sensitive to the possibility of a likely threat and that is why 
in its policy there is a somewhat bigger proportion of concern, 
more caution concerning its own security. However, it is not 
for me to explain the positions of other states. I am sure that 
the presidents will have an opportunity to familiarize [us] with 
their opinions. 
  [Correspondent] [passage indistinct] Did you talk with 
President Clinton about the fate of Radio Free Europe? 
  [Havel] Yes, we did talk about it, but at this moment I am 
unable to say anything specific in this matter the press. 
  [Correspondent] If you allow me I shall revert to 
"Partnership for Peace." You said yesterday that the Czech 
Republic was willing to begin immediately to fill the project 
with a concrete content. What is this content and in order to 
realize these objectives does it envisage bilateral 
consultations in our region or even consultations within the 
framework of the Visegrad Four? 
  [Havel] The partnership for peace project has several items 
which characterize the areas of cooperation. Those specific 
discussions will be about how this cooperation is to be 
implemented in individual areas. This will be the subject of 
these discussions. The Czech side is prepared for such 
discussions and likewise the North Atlantic Alliance is also 
prepared for them. President Clinton told us that at the close 
of the summit in Brussels Manfred Werner had given instructions 
to the states of the North Atlantic Alliance that if these 
[Visegrad] countries showed interest that they were to sent 
immediately their experts and start preparing these protocols at 
an expert level. The document describes precisely what kind of 
cooperation is involved. As far as consultations are concerned 
within the framework of regions the partnership for peace 
project, and this is one of its clauses, envisages cooperation 
among individual partnership countries which will then be 
partners of the Alliance. 
  Talks will be held separately with each country. Such talks 
will always take the form 16 plus one. The talks are 
individualized and in the case of each country this may have a 
different content, perhaps a different rhythm of contacts, 
different frequence of joint exercises and the like, or 
cooperation in the field of inspection of military budgets and 
arms manufacture and the like. Nonetheless, the document also 
contains a clause that the individual partnership countries, 
which will sign up to this project, are also to cooperate 
together. One can hardly imagine a situation in which two 
partner countries of the North Atlantic Alliance would have cool 
relations with each other. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, while you were discussing it 
and in view of the very special experiences over the history of 
Czechoslovakia did you discuss in any way, did you mention in 
any way a Russian politician named Vladimir Adolfovich 
Zhirinovskiy and what he may mean? 
  [Havel] Similarly like representatives of some other 
neighboring countries we also have certain historical 
experiences of our own, above all the one that if our liberty, 
our independence are sacrificed to some kind of an illusionary 
peace, if someone judges that such a small and distant country 
is not worthy of a possible involvement or possible sacrifices 
than in history this has never paid off to those countries since 
later they had to bring sacrifices that were disproportionately 
far bigger. Central Europe is a region that is very exposed 
lying in the very center of Europe where in history various wars 
begun and ended. It is a crossroad of spiritual and 
civilizational tides, geo-political interests and this is why 
our security is a part of the all-European security and after 
all historical experiences the West is in my view is well aware 
of this, and it is aware of this face to face to certain extreme 
or nationalistic voices that one can hear at present from 
various countries. 
  [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, did you discuss the financial 
dimension of the Partnership for Peace with the presidents of 
the Visegrad [Group]? I have in mind their possibilities to 
financially participate on this project. 
  [Havel] The Partnership for Peace project is a project of a 
defense alliance, a NATO project. Therefore, its specific 
articles relate especially to the cooperation between the 
armies, the cooperation on security. However, it is by no means 
only this. The project has its political dimension. The 
cooperation on security is envisaged on the basis of shared 
democratic values as well as a shared perception of economy and 
of the economic reform. This means that, indirectly, this 
partnership must lead, and it is assumed that it will lead, to 
the deepening of relations in all other areas, including even 
such areas as is the cooperation between parliaments etc. 
  [Correspondent] President Clinton regularly uses only the 
word Visegrad. You were speaking about the countries of Central 
Europe. This conceptual tension is rather well known. Did 
anything change during this visit? I mean, our idea of 
individual states and some Visegrad cooperation as opposed to 
the American idea of Visegrad as a relatively well defined 
region? 
  [Havel] I think that the difference is not as big as it 
might 
seem. Individual countries are aware that the era, when it was 
necessary to demonstrate our inseparable unity in such a 
manifest way, is over. This was [needed] at a time when we were 
doing away with the Warsaw treaty, when we tried to free 
ourselves from under the Soviet hegemony. At that time it was 
important that the heads of states and premiers of those three 
countries often came together. It was at the time when we 
strived to achieve a fast withdrawal of the Russian army and we 
demonstrated our political unity both eastward and westward. 
That era is over. The tasks were completed. 
  Now comes the era of a more concrete, regional and permanent 
cooperation. A cooperation which is not being turned into 
problem by anybody and whose urgency and necessity is being 
perceived by all. Everybody knows that the basic principle of a 
foreign policy is to be in good terms with one's neighbors and 
to cooperate with them in the best possible way. 
  Hence, from the conceptual point of view, there are no 
differences and it is not essential whether we use the words 
Visegrad Group or not. If you wish so, I can use them. By the 
way, this group was given its name by you journalists. 
  Could you give us a specific proof of cooperation that is 
requested from Visegrad Group countries? 
  [Havel] As I have already indicated all Visegrad countries 
realize that cooperation will have to come from both sides and 
that this means also an involvement from their side and not only 
involvement on the side of the North Atlantic Alliance. Among 
others this means, for instance, a possible participation of our 
units in operation which the Alliance may carry out at the 
request of the United Nations or the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe. This implies a certain investment, both 
moral and material. None of these countries have any doubt 
about this since it arises directly from the project. 
  [Correspondent] At a news conference today Slovak Prime 
Minister Vladimir Meciar voiced the view that cooperation among 
the countries of the Visegrad group was stagnating. What is 
your view and do you think that partnership for peace may become 
a factor that may make such cooperation more dynamic? 
  [Havel] I would not dare to say that it stagnates. I know, 
for instance, that interior ministers have regular contacts 
because the whole region has a common refugee problem, that 
other ministers also cooperate, that cooperation is taking place 
in various areas. As you know the Czech Republic has developed 
initiative to speed up the formation of a free trade zone, to 
expand free trade by including in it some further commodities. 
I would not say that this co-operation stagnates. It is 
perhaps less visible. It has simply shifted to various specific 
areas and is less demonstrative. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, has the Czech Republic or 
other individual countries of the Visegrad four countries 
obtained an approximate date and a time-table when they could 
join the Alliance? 
  [Havel] This issue was not discussed. Everyone was very 
reticent as far as setting dates was concerned and that included 
us. This is because we know very well that such a matter depends 
on an enormous amount of various factors and circumstances which 
can be hardly envisaged and very few politicians would want to 
take a blame for setting a date which cannot then be met. We 
merely say that we want to be regular members of the Alliance as 
soon as possible, and from the other side we have been assured 
that nothing stand in our way that would prevent us from 
becoming regular members soon.

  [Excerpts] Our first report is about the meeting of the 
Visegrad Group and the American President in Prague. An 
international news conference, at which Peter Boross and Arpad 
Goncz talked about their meeting with the American President and 
the Visegrad Group, ended a short while ago. Peter Nyaradi 
reports: 
  [Nyaradi] The American partner has unexpectedly extended its 
previous position. First of all, the new element is that they 
are willing to give more significant economic support to us, 
Prime Minister Peter Boross pointed out at the beginning of his 
summary of the day. Besides this, during the regional and 
bilateral meetings in Prague, Peter Boross said, the Partnership 
for Peace was seen as a good plan; that Hungary expected more is 
another issue,, but this is reality. However, it is a good 
thing that as regards NATO, thoughts can already be given to the 
concrete tasks of the plan provided by the Partnership for 
Peace. In connection with this plan Peter Boross said the 
following: 
  [Boross] "This is the program of a newly elected president 
who is to be the president of the United States for another four 
years. Obviously, he wants to fulfill his first foreign 
political program of great significance. This is encouraging. 
We would be less optimistic if the president had proclaimed 
such a program when he only had, let us say, six months to go. 
We see a chance and we see that it is not possible to adopt a 
position in these questions with unrealistic ambitions. We also 
see that extremes and extreme wishes which are impossible to 
fulfill do not create a good impression." 
  [Nyaradi] Regarding the bilateral meetings with leaders of 
the other Visegrad countries, the head of government said that 
during his talks with Vaclav Klaus, first of all the problems of 
the free trade zone was discussed. Peter Boross also added that 
it creates bad feelings if a country pushes itself to the 
forefront too much. It is no sin that all politicians protect 
the interests of their own country, but to overemphasize them 
may result in the danger of the action missing its target. Many 
questions were discussed with Slovak Head of Government Meciar. 
Although there are topics on which there is no harmony, this 
cannot be an obstacle in, for example, the development of 
economic cooperation between the two countries. 
  On the matter of Bos [Gabcikovo power station] and the 
minority question, both countries stuck to their own opinion. 
The Hungarian party also said that the system of individual 
rights in Slovakia is was good, however, many individuals 
already represent collective interests [as heard]. 
  The Polish-Hungarian meeting took place without any conflict 
and difference of opinion, Peter Boross evaluated. 
  President Arpad Goncz said the following about this 
extraordinary day today and about the negotiations: 
  [Goncz] "I start by saying that these negotiations consisted 
of bilateral and regional meetings. This was an indication of 
the fact that the United States is not non-committal and does 
not seclude itself; its commitment towards our region is 
unchanged. Its presence is a key issue from the viewpoints of 
the continent's stability and of the positive U.S. influence. 
The conditions for European stability are the U.S. presence, 
NATO's ability to act, NATO's extension, and a stable central 
Europe -- since security, the security of Europe is indivisible, 
and central Europe should not be a gray zone, a security vacuum. 
Russia and Ukraine, which are in the process of 
democratization, also represent conditions of stability, as do 
good relations between the United States, NATO, and central 
Europe and Russia." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] U.S. President Bill Clinton ended his two-day 
visit to the Czech Republic this afternoon and left from Ruzyne 
airport for Kiev and Moscow. [passage omitted] 
  Before that, Bill Clinton briefly assessed the talks held in 
Prague this morning and their results. He said the the aim of 
his European tour was to increase Europe's security by 
strengthening its integration based on freedom, democracy, and 
market economy. He expressed admiration and support for the 
reforms in Central Europe, and said that the success of these 
reforms corresponded to the interests of U.S. security. 
  As for the Partnership for Peace, Bill Clinton said that 
this 
represented neither NATO membership nor mere waiting for it. 
The matter at stake was not whether the alliance would accept 
new members, the issue was when and how, said the U.S. 
President. He went on to say that the United States' share in 
the strengthening of the democratic and market reforms in 
Central Europe was also discussed. Bill Clinton announced in 
this connection, the setting up of the organization Democracy 
Network, which is to expand sources for independent groups in 
Central Europe.

  [Text] Some pronouncements by European politicians on the 
state of Slovakia's preparedness to join NATO and other 
structures have not been very flattering. Slovak President 
Michal Kovac commented on such statements as follows: 
  [Begin Kovac recording] We have noted that representatives 
of 
some NATO countries failed to mention the Slovak Republic. 
Differences in the economic standards of individual countries 
should not determine whether or not they join Partnership for 
Peace. We discussed this issue with President Clinton, urging 
him to exert an influence on his partners in NATO member states 
so that they stop leaving Slovakia out of this group, either 
intentionally or unintentionally. President Clinton said that 
America will not do this, now or in the future, and that he will 
speak to other representatives along these lines. 
  I think, however, that the whole issue will be resolved 
simply because Slovakia -- just like the three other [Visegrad] 
states -- has clearly stated that it is joining Partnership for 
Peace and is ready to sign the relevant treaties and documents, 
and to observe them. I think that once this has taken place the 
issue of omitting Slovakia and so on will have become quite 
pointless. [end recording]

  [Text] The highest Czech representatives -- the president, 
prime minister, and foreign minister -- hosted dinners for their 
Visegrad Group countries' counterparts. The foreign ministers, 
meeting at a dinner in the Cernin Palace, agreed that the 
Partnership for Peace is the first step toward integrating the 
Visegrad Group states into NATO, and that in the current 
conditions the security guarantees provided by the project are 
adequate. The Czech foreign minister confirmed this in an 
interview given to Czech Radio: 
  [Begin Zieleniec recording] I think that the Partnership for 
Peace is quite a step toward integrating our country into NATO 
and toward creating new security structures in Europe. We all 
know, not only from foreign politics but from everyday life, 
that when several partners negotiate then usually none of them 
immediately achieves everything he wants. 
  On the other hand, the preparation of this project has 
taught 
us an important lesson. From the moment the idea was first 
conceived, we have achieved substantial and truly important 
changes, through which an initially very raw and purely 
military-technological project has become something possessing a 
significant political dimension, something that can be 
interpreted only as a step toward integrating central European 
countries into the NATO security system. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Paris, Jan 12 (AFP) -- UN Secretary-General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali has promised that planned UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] actions in the Bosnian towns of Tuzla and 
Srebrenica will proceed "as quickly as possible," French Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe said Wednesday. "Mr. Butrus-Ghali assured 
us that the planning required for these operations would take 
place as quickly as possible," Juppe said. 
  The other countries contributing troops for these missions 
-- 
Britain, Canada and Denmark -- would be in touch with the UN 
secretary-general to this end, he added. The United Nations 
Protection Force in ex-Yugoslavia plans to reopen the airport at 
Tuzla and to relieve the Canadian UNPROFOR contingent in 
Srebrenica. 
  "It is not a matter of launching air raids against Tuzla or 
Srebrenica," Juppe said. "It is a question of organizing the 
rotation of the Canadian contingent in Srebrenica and clearly 
warning the belligerents that if they prevent UNPROFOR's freedom 
of movement, they will be exposing themselves to our reaction." 
In Tuzla, Juppe said the main point was not "conquering the 
airport" but "saying that we are installing ourselves at this 
airport to assure its operation." 
  "If anyone opposes this operation, there will be an 
immediate 
reaction from UNPROFOR and from its aerial coverage," he said. 
[passage omitted] 
  In Sarajevo Wednesday, journalists accused UNPROFOR of 
applying a double standard in Bosnia after UNPROFOR military 
commander General Francis Briquemont condemned Bosnian 
Government forces for shelling Bosnian Serb forces Tuesday. 
General Briquemont said in a statement that artillery units of 
President Alija Izetbegovic's army had opened fire on Serbian 
positions around 10.00 a.m. (0900 GMT) Tuesday, ending two days 
of calm around the capital. The journalists said, however, that 
shells had fallen on Sarajevo several hours earlier and that no 
protest had been issued against Serbian forces following that 
attack. 
  International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) official 
Jessica Barry said that a shell had fallen on the Red Cross's 
Bosnian headquarters at 9.15 a.m. (0815 GMT), killing one person 
and injuring two ICRC employees. UNPROFOR spokesman Bill Aikman 
said that government forces had fired 200 shells against the 
Bosnian Serbs, who responded by firing 600 shells at Sarajevo. 
"That's a large number of shells fired by the Bosnian side, 
which installed artillery pieces near civilian objectives in the 
centre of Sarajevo," Aikman said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] GENEVA, Jan 12 (AFP) -- UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali asked his special envoy in former Yugoslavia 
Wednesday [12 January] to study the feasibility of air strikes 
in Bosnia, amid doubts both within and outside ex-Yugoslavia 
that NATO planes would intervene. Butrus-Ghali called on 
Yasushi Akashi to carry out a "preparatory study" in response to 
a renewed North Atlantic Treaty Organisation warning of air 
strikes, a United Nations spokesman said here. The study will 
cover the military and civilian implications of possible attacks 
by NATO planes, the spokesman added. 
  The decision to use air strikes if deemed necessary -- and 
if 
approved by Butrus-Ghali -- was taken at the 16-nation NATO 
summit in Brussels which ended Tuesday. Alliance leaders warned 
they might call for air strikes against Bosnian Serb troops to 
end the 21-month siege of Sarajevo, and force the reopening of 
Tuzla airport and of the road link to the Moslem enclave of 
Srebrenica. 
  Earlier Wednesday THE WASHINGTON POST reported Butrus-Ghali 
sharply rebuked the UN commander in former Yugoslavia, General 
Jean Cot, for saying in a French newspaper interview he had 
repeatedly asked the UN chief for authority to order airstrikes. 
  Meanwhile leaders of the international community and 
ex-Yugoslavia's warring parties remained sceptical about the use 
of air strikes and over any peace benefits that might accrue 
from such an intervention. In Prague US president Bill Clinton 
said prospects for peace in Bosnia had diminished as "for the 
first time all three parties seem to believe they have something 
to gain by fighting," and that a political settlement was 
currently "difficult" to envisage. 
  In Paris French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said 
Butrus-Ghali has promised that planned actions by UN troops in 
Tuzla and Srebrenica would proceed "as quickly as possible." 
But Juppe added "It is not a matter of launching air raids 
against Tuzla or Srebrenica," but primarily of ensuring the 
safety of troops in those areas. 
  The countries contributing troops for these missions -- 
Britain, Canada and Denmark -- were divided Wednesday over the 
issue of air strikes. British Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind 
told BBC radio London was "unenthusiastic" about air strikes and 
wanted NATO to show great caution before resorting to that 
option. Rifkind said: "One has to be very cautious indeed 
about the use of air power, precisely because... we have forces 
on the ground." The Canadians had also expressed great caution, 
he added. And British Prime Minister John Major told MPs he 
declined to extend Britain's commitment of troops to help with 
UN humanitarian aid in Bosnia until their security could be 
guaranteed. 
  But in Copenhagen, Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup 
Rasmussen 
said Danish UN troops were "ready for Serb attacks in case of 
NATO air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions in Bosnia." And a 
Danish Defence Ministry official told AFP that 10 Danish tanks 
and 36 Swedish armoured vehicles blocked by Bosnian Serb forces 
in Pancevo, Serbia -- along with 300 Danish and Swedish soldiers 
-- since October were ready to proceed to Tuzla, their final 
destination, by "indirect routes." 
  Meanwhile in Sarajevo, where at least seven civilians were 
killed and 49 wounded Tuesday, Ejup Ganic, the nominal vice 
president of Bosnia, told AFP the NATO declaration contained 
"certain aspects which lead us to think things will go better" 
for the Moslem-dominated Bosnian side. But he added that he 
failed to see "when and under which circumstances" air strikes 
could be carried out. 
  The city's OSLOBODJENJE daily said the city's mainly Moslem 
population was sceptical, and that the mainly Moslem Bosnian 
Army "would suffer nothing but harm if it trusted the NATO 
threat." The scepticism was echoed in Belgrade, where Colonel 
Ljubodrag Stojadinovic, a spokesman for the army of rump 
Yugoslavia -- comprising Serbia and Montenegro -- told the 
Bosnian Serb SRNA agency that air strikes were not very likely 
because no accord exists on how they should be carrried out." 
He added that any foreign intervention would only "exacerbate 
the war." 
  Butrus-Ghali had admitted Wednesday in an interview with 
French daily LE FIGARO that he had "no idea" how NATO air 
strikes could be put into effect.

  [Text] Cairo, January 13 (TANJUG) -- French Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe urged Thursday [13 January] stepping up 
political pressure on all the three warring parties in Bosnia so 
peace agreement would be reached at the next round of the Geneva 
talks. In a statement to TANJUG Cairo correspondent, Juppe said 
the aim of France was to "exert strong political pressure on the 
warring sides in Bosnia" -- the Moslems, Serbs and Croats. 
  France, together with Great Britain, initiated at the recent 
NATO summit in Brussels that a threat with air strikes on the 
positions of the Bosnian Serbs be included in the final document 
if the Serbs resisted opening of the airport in Tuzla and 
prevented replacement of the U.N. troops in Srebrenica. Tuzla 
and Srebrenica have been declared safe areas and are situated in 
northeastern and eastern Bosnia.

<F P=106> [Note of Protest by the Foreign Ministry of the Republic of </F>
Albania, handed over to Greek Embassy Secretary Dimitrios Lopas 
at the Foreign Ministry on 12 January] 
  [Text] The Foreign Ministry spokesman reports that, today, 
Dimitrios Lopas [name as heard], Greek Embassy secretary in 
Tirana, was summoned to this Ministry and was handed over a note 
of protest. 
  The note states that at 1610 on 10 January 1994, a Greek 
patrol ship entered Albanian territorial waters south of Qefal 
Cape. At 1615, after approaching within approximately one mile 
of the Albanian coast, the Greek ship fired a volley in the 
direction of the seashore. The ship left immediately after a 
torpedo-boat of the Albanian Navy Forces of the Sarande military 
district appeared. 
  The Foreign Ministry of the Republic of Albania stresses 
that 
such actions by the Greek Navy Forces have been recurrent. On 5 
November 1993, a Greek ship violated the Albanian territorial 
waters up to eight miles into our territory, while on 4 January 
1994 another Greek ship opened fire on an Albanian motor-boat 
that was fishing within Albanian territorial waters. 
  The Foreign Ministry of the Republic of Albania protests to 
the Embassy of the Greek Republic in Tirana about such flagrant 
actions and asks the Greek competent bodies to give explanations 
of such provocative acts. The Greek Government should take 
immediate measures that such events be no longer repeated 
because they aim at infringing the sovereignty of the Albanian 
state and seriously harming the spirit of good neighborliness 
between the two countries. The note says that these events run 
counter to the efforts to strengthen the cooperation between the 
two states and the friendship between our two peoples. 
  We remind you that the Albanian Navy Forces are engaged and 
ready to energetically act in defense of the inviolability of 
the territorial waters of the Republic of Albania. The Foreign 
Ministry of the Republic of Albania asks the Greek Embassy in 
Tirana to inform the Greek authorities of the above and is 
waiting for the relevant explanations.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Lilyana Khristovska: "Whether He Was Duped or </F>
Not, Zhelev Has Violated the Constitution"] 
  [Text] Constitutional Law experts claim that the 
unpublished Decree No. 269 issued by the president of the 
Republic and his letter filed under No. 02-01-6/24 November 1993 
represent a flagrant violation of the Constitution and provide 
sufficient reason for canceling his prerogatives ahead of 
schedule. 
  According to the aforementioned experts, both the decree and 
the letter are invalid as official documents from the legal 
point of view. This applies to the decree because it has not 
been published, which the Constitution requires, while the 
letter has not been classified as an official document. 
  According to the Constitution, a military cabinet attached 
to 
the President's Office does not exist. As supreme commander in 
chief, the president chairs the Consultative Council for 
National Security that should act as an interdepartmental body 
rather than being subordinate to the Presidency. According to 
the Constitution, the status of the Consultative Council should 
be determined by an act of Parliament, which the deputies have 
so far been too busy to pass, rather than by the president 
himself. 
  Nevertheless, it does not mean that the president is 
entitled 
to establish a duplicate body which neither the Constitution nor 
the law have provided for. 
  The Presidency is an auxiliary service attached to the 
President's Office that has no independent state functions 
whatsoever. Relations between the advisers serving in the 
Presidency and the head of state are based on internal 
organizational principles. The status of the president's 
advisers is strictly confined to the activities of consulting 
experts and the president is not entitled to entrust them with 
any state functions whatsoever. There is even more: The 
president is not authorized to instruct official departments in 
connection with assuming any obligations whatsoever regarding 
his advisers. 
  The president's only prerogatives are those granted to him 
by 
the Constitution. Any other initiatives on his part are 
self-styled.

minister of defense, the chief of the General Staff, and the 
commanders of the branches of service. The chief of the 
Military Office and the advisers attached to the Military Office 
are entitled to express their personal and professional views,

councils 
shall be submitted to the Military Office within the scheduled

directives, orders, and instructions issued by the minister of 
defense, of all orders and instructions issued by the chief of 
the General Staff, and copies of all similar, relevant documents 
issued by the commanders of the Armed Forces' branches of 
service. 
  5. The Military Office shall be submitted a copy of all 
analytical documents and papers related to inspections, military

attendance. 
  III. The Military Office is subordinate to the president 
only. In its relations with civilians and military personnel 
from the Ministry of Defense, the General Staff, and the 
branches of service, the Military Office shall apply the 
Constitution, laws, and military statutes. 
  The rank of Military Office staff members is settled 
according to the following protocol: 
  On the rituals and other official ceremonies that require 
the 
placing of guests according to their ranks, individual members 
of the Military Office staff attending such ceremonies are 
expected to stand as follows: 
  -- The adjutant-general of the Military Office is the same 
rank as the deputy chief of the Armed Forces' General Staff;

deputy commanders of the branches of service. 
  On occasions on which the entire staff of the Military 
Office 
attends, the members are standing in the ranks to the left of

  [Text] Joze Skok asked Boris Sovic, state secretary for 
energy, to comment on the statement by Jakov Sinovcic, Croatian 
duty officer at the Krsko power plant. 
  [Begin recording] [Skok] Mr. Sovic, what will Slovenia do 
if Croatia takes 50 percent of the electricity produced in the 
Krsko power plant for its own network? 
  [Sovic] The mutual agreement that has been applied for some 
time, which governs the operation and exchange of power between 
the Croatian and Slovene electrical power systems, envisages 
that the so-called schedule is coordinated, and that 
coordination of the schedules is in fact the basis of 
cooperation of the two networks. In the case of the Croatian 
side failing to respect the Slovene quota of electricity, that 
is, if the schedule proposed by the Slovene side is violated, it 
is envisaged that, in the case of minor differences of up to 
20-30 megawatts, it could be corrected within the system, but if 
the differences go over this limit, then the Croatian side will 
be warned that there is a violation of the schedule, of the 
available quantity. 
  So far, international practice has shown that, in such 
cases, 
solutions have always been found, that a joint agreement has 
been found. If this does not happen in this case, it would be a 
precedent that will present the behavior of an energetic system 
in an unusual light. 
  [Skok] The Krsko power plant should resume work today after 
1500. In order to operate fully, it would need some four days. 
What would that mean regarding the dispatch of electricity to 
neighboring Croatia? 
  [Sovic] The fact is that the Croatian Electricity Board has 
not reduced, and even less settled, the debt to the Krsko power 
plant. However, one should tell the public that the reports we 
have heard to the effect that these are debts from before 1991 
are not true. The nuclear power plant says that what are 
involved are debts that were incurred from June to November 
1993, that is, last year. The report for December will be 
presented soon. So far, the Croatian side has not denied this. 
  If the Croatian side uses the electricity, that is, if the 
schedule is not respected and a disproportion occurs in the 
system, decisions will be made accordingly. [end recording]

  [Text] At the political collegium held by Prime Minister 
Janez Drnovsek, Maks Tajnikar, Slovene minister for economic 
affairs, spoke about the contents of yesterday's talks with 
Croatian Minister for Economy Vidosevic at Otocec. They spoke 
about Slovene demands that Croatia settles its debt to the 
nuclear power plant in Krsko. Minister Tajnikar pointed out that 
the demand for settlement of debts due is a business problem 
that means that the buyer must pay for the goods purchased. The 
problem has not been solved and the two ministers will probably 
meet again soon, after the Croatian minister holds consultations 
in Zagreb about the Slovene demands.

  [Text] The Slovene Government has today done everything 
with a view to settling relations between our state and the 
neighboring Croatia. Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek has 
assembled all ministers in order to coordinate views on some 
issues regarding relations between the neighbors -- ranging from 
the Krsko nuclear power plant to the joint border. The general 
secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced a high 
level meeting between the two countries. At that meeting, the 
(?prime ministers) will coordinate mutual relations. In this 
connection, let us add that shortly before 1530 the gradual 
connection of the nuclear power plant to the surroundings has 
begun.

  [Text] Let us continue our program with new developments 
regarding the Maribor arms affair. When expounding yesterday on 
some decisions by the Maribor Public Prosecutor's Office 
regarding the finding of arms at the Maribor airport, Dusan 
Pozar, senior prosecutor in the Maribor Public Prosecutor's 
Office, pointed out that the basic prosecutor's office worked 
according to law. Proof was insufficient to prove unauthorized 
dealing in arms, or to prove smuggling. According to the 
prosecutor, there is still the suspicion that the Defense 
Ministry has recognized Hasan Cengic as the authorized envoy of 
the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and traded in arms with him. This 
happened in spring 1992 when it sold him 5,560 automatic rifles 
in violation of the UN Security Council Resolution on the 
embargo on arms sale to the territory of the former Yugoslavia. 
According to the prosecutor, Janez Jansa, as the only competent 
person, has violated the Security Council Resolution several 
times. Therefore, the Maribor Public Prosecutor's Office has 
presented the matter to the Ljubljana Public Prosecutor's Office.

  [Text] Sarajevo, Jan 12 (AFP) -- Sarajevo's mainly Moslem 
population is skeptical about NATO's latest warning that it 
might attack Serb artillery positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
OSLOBODJENJE daily reported Wednesday. 
  The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation declaration on 
Tuesday 
is "not very clear and even contradictory," the paper said 
adding that "it carries no ultimatum, thus no firm decision to 
end Milosevic's campaign by the only possible means -- force." 
Slobodan Milosevic is the president of Serbia. 
  The paper added that the mainly Moslem Bosnian army "would 
suffer nothing but harm if it trusted the NATO threat" and that 
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has also dismissed the 
warning. The NATO declaration came at the end of the alliance's 
two-day summit Tuesday.

  [Excerpt] Belgrade, 11 Jan (TANJUG) -- Deputy Serb Republic 
(RS) President Nikola Koljevic said today that during the talks 
yesterday with the Japanese diplomat Yasushi Akashi, the new 
head of the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] for the former 
Yugoslavia, and Francis Briquemont, the military commander of 
the peacekeeping forces for Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Serbs got 
assurances that there can be no military intervention without 
the consent of these high-ranking UN representatives, and that 
they "in no way favor a military option as something desirable 
or something with high priority." 
  In the Belgrade radio program "One Argument More" today, 
Koljevic said the Serbs, for their part, have offered everything 
demanded from them and have been cooperative, in the belief that 
this is the price of peace. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Belgrade, 11 Jan (TANJUG) -- Serb President Radovan 
Karadzic said today that the international community remained 
"blind in respect to the crisis in former Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
that it continued to encourage the Muslim side to carry on with 
the war," SRNA [Bosnian Serb news agency] reports. 
  Commenting on the latest NATO declaration in Brussels, 
Karadzic told SRNA that this document by the international 
community is designed to exert more pressure on the Serb side 
despite the fact that, according to Karadzic, "the Serbs are the 
most cooperative side when it comes not only to humanitarian 
issues but also to the peace agreement." 
  "Only the Serbs have fulfilled everything that was expected 
from them," Karadzic added. "Instead of lifting the sanctions 
and exerting pressure on the Muslim side to accept peace, the 
international community continues to issue threats against the 
Serbs." These threats, to put it mildly, are counterproductive 
to the peace process, Karadzic said, adding that the Muslims did 
not feel obliged to sign the peace agreement for as long as the 
West continues to encourage them. 
  Responding to accusations that the Serbs did not allow the 
peacekeeping troops in the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica to be 
replaced, Karadzic said an agreement on replacement had been 
reached a long time ago, "but that the technical details of the 
agreement must be worked out with our generals." 
  "As for the fighting around Sarajevo, even UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Force] reports clearly indicate that the Muslims have 
been attacking the Serb positions. When it comes to Sarajevo 
airport, obviously it is not in our interest to shell the 
airport; we definitely have not been doing that," Karadzic said 
in reference to international accusations of the alleged Serb 
"strangulation" of Sarajevo. 
  Karadzic said a peace agreement must be signed before the 
airport in Tuzla was opened, adding that airports in Tuzla, 
Banjaluka, and Mostar would be opened simultaneously on the day 
when a peace agreement, guaranteed by the international 
community, was signed. 
  "Europe has allowed chaos to be created in it. Europe caused 
it, and it would be decent of Europe to contribute toward a 
peaceful solution for that chaos," Karadzic said. He added: 
"We have fulfilled all our obligations, and we expect that the 
peace agreement will be signed on 18 January. If the peace 
agreement is not signed, we will demand immediate suspension of 
sanctions against the Serb nation from the international 
community, and we still will be ready to negotiate for peace," 
SRNA reports.

  [Text] General Rasim Delic, commander of the Supreme 
Command of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Colonel General 
Ante Roso, commander of the General Staff of the Croatian 
Defense Council [HVO], today met at the Sarajevo airport. The 
meeting was presided over by General Briquemont, commander of 
the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In 
addition to the commanders, the meeting was also attended by 
General (Ramsey) and General (Filieu), Messrs. (Dimelo) and 
(Andreyev), as well as Brigadier General Stjepan Siber. 
  The participants in the meeting discussed the situation in 
central Bosnia, the opening of the 
Metkovic-Mostar-Jablanica-central Bosnia road, problems 
concerning the release of the helicopters of the Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in Medjugorje, and the obligations of the HVO 
to allow the transit of a field hospital for Mostar. 
  After the talks, which were held at the request of Messrs. 
Stoltenberg and Akashi, a joint statement was issued. The 
statement reads: 
  First, the General Command of the Supreme Command of the 
Army 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the General Staff of the Croatian 
Defense Council are ready to start talks on the ways of 
establishing a total cease-fire in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which 
could go into effect pending an agreement between the 
delegations of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. 
  Second, it was agreed that bilateral talks on the exchange 
of 
prisoners open, and that issues concerning the release of two 
helicopters of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina currently blocked 
in Medjugorje be resolved. 
  Third, General Roso has issued the authorization for 
engineering material, including the ferries [trajekt] of the UN 
forces, to set off on the main route from Ploce, via Mostar, to 
the Mostovi area in Bijela. If the state delegations of the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia reach a bilateral 
agreement, talks on the realization of the agreement between the 
Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croatian 
Defense Council would continue. 
  This was stated in a communique issued by the Press Centar 
of 
the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Belgrade, 12 Jan (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, 
president of the Srpska republic assembly, said today that NATO 
has no reason to demand that the Serb side release the Canadian 
battalion from Srebrenica, because the Serbs "are not holding 
members of the Canadian battalion under blockade". 
  "The Serb side allows the forces to be replaced at any 
moment 
because they arrived there with our permission," Krajisnik told 
Radio Yugoslavia in response to the NATO summit in Brussels, 
which ended yesterday. 
  Concerning the request to open Tuzla's airport, Krajisnik 
stressed that the Serb side has nothing against that, so long as 
peace is signed first. 
  "We cannot allow Tuzla's airport to be opened because it 
would be used for the arming of the Muslim side," Krajisnik 
said. He recalled the negative experience with Sarajevo airport 
which the Serbs handed over to the UN Protection Force 
[UNPROFOR] on 1 July 1992. 
  "We clearly let UNPROFOR know that they abused the opening 
of 
Sarajevo airport because they allowed the Muslims to dig a 
tunnel under the airport," Krajisnik said. "The United Nations 
and the forces deployed at the airport and other areas allowed 
the Muslim forces to arm themselves through channels exclusively 
controlled by UN forces." 
  A request for the reopening of Tuzla airport -- at a time 
when peace and the signing of a peace plan for former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are in sight -- can only prolong the war, 
Krajisnik concluded. 
  As for the decision on NATO's involvement if Sarajevo is 
attacked, it is superfluous in Krajisnik's view, because the 
Serb side "is not the one strangling Sarajevo, as they keep 
saying." 
  He also denied accusations that Serbs are obstructing convoy 
movements and humanitarian aid deliveries to the Muslim side. 
  "We are letting the humanitarian convoys through all our 
checkpoints. All that is needed is that those who are bringing 
in the humanitarian aid do this according to the agreement and 
protocol signed between humanitarian organizations and the 
Srpska republic authorities," Krajisnik stressed. 
  Despite these unjustified conditions conveyed to the Serb 
side from the NATO summit in Brussels, Krajisnik said that a new 
approach to the Bosnian crisis gained ground, since the 
ultimatum-style tone, used until now to constantly force the 
Serbs to make territorial concessions to Muslims, has been 
abandoned.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris </F>
Silajdzic by Stevo Latinovic; place and date not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Latinovic] Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister 
Haris Silajdzic this afternoon returned home from a two-day 
visit to Pakistan. 
  Mr. Prime Minister, you visited Pakistan on the invitation 
of 
Pakistani Prime Minister Mrs. Benazir Bhutto. Could you assess 
your meetings? What are the results of your visit to Pakistan? 
  [Silajdzic] Yes, I was received in Islamabad by Pakistani 
President Mr. Leghari, who is the new president of Pakistan. I 
briefed him on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the 
situation regarding negotiations. Considering that Pakistan is 
a country that has been expressing a solid and consistent 
support for the just (?cause) of Bosnia-Herzegovina, I was told 
that Pakistan will continue to support Bosnia-Herzegovina 
bilaterally and multilaterally. The multilateral plan 
essentially boils down to support in the United Nations and the 
Organization of Islamic Countries. 
  Regarding the Organization of Islamic Countries, the 
ministers of the so-called contact group will meet in Geneva on 
17 [January]. These are the foreign ministers of eight member 
states of the Organization of Islamic Countries. At this 
meeting they will evaluate and direct the activities of these 
countries with regard to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Therefore, the 
Pakistani president reiterated that Pakistan's support to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will remain the same, that Pakistan will not 
[words indistinct] with regard to humanitarian help, and the 
help to our diplomatic efforts aimed at halting the aggression 
on Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The assessment of that meeting is that we have a big friend 
in Pakistan, as has been the case in the past. I must tell you 
that I was surprised by the (?depth) of the concern shown by not 
only the official organs, the government and the presidency, but 
also the people and the media. The presence of the problems of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is felt everywhere in Pakistan. This country 
is some 6,000 kilometers away, and it is a bit strange that our 
problem is more present there than in some European countries. 
  This meeting took place in Karachi on 9 and 10 [January]. I 
also held a meeting with Prime Minister Mrs. Bhutto. We reached 
several specific agreements on bilateral cooperation between 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Pakistan. As in the case of Turkey, a 
question was raised about an agreement on friendship and 
cooperation, an intergovernmental agreement on friendship and 
cooperation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Pakistan. 
Considering that such an agreement is already being worked on, 
that the draft of such an agreement with Turkey is being worked 
on, it could happen that the drafts of both agreements, the 
agreement of Bosnia-Herzegovina on friendship and cooperation 
with Turkey and Pakistan are reached very soon, as early as 2 
February, and that these agreements are signed during the visit 
by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Turkish Prime Minister 
Ciller to Sarajevo. 
  I am not sure that [words indistinct] but in any case we 
will 
try, if this [words indistinct]. The agreement would mean that, 
as of now, all matters of bilateral and multilateral cooperation 
will have one basis, namely that a certain ministry in Pakistan 
or Turkey will have the basis that they could refer to in 
determining some course of action. They will not need to seek 
the (?approval) of the president of prime minister. Individual 
cases will not need new decisions. The decision will already 
exist and all government organs in Turkey or Pakistan or 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will be able to refer to this agreement. 
This will in turn speed up and intensify cooperation. 
  Of course, such agreements are very important for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. We are talking about the traditionally 
friendly countries, the countries with great potentials, the 
countries that are of great importance in their regions. 
  Moreover, the Pakistani prime minister told me that Pakistan 
has set aside $1 million for the organization and work of the 
court for crimes in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We did not know 
anything about this. Pakistan (?decided on this) a few days ago. 
I was informed about this in Islamabad. The problem lies in 
the fact that the war tribunal does not have sufficient funds 
and that because of that it [words indistinct]. I was surprised 
by this to a great extent. Some European countries have shown 
interest in the work of the tribunal for war crimes but the 
funds were lacking. This is a move by the Pakistani Government 
that deserves every praise. [passage omitted] 
  [Latinovic] According to our information, Pakistan said that 
it will do everything in it power and in diplomatic circles to 
influence, via the Organization of Islamic Countries, the 
international community to change its stand on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. What are in your view the real chances of 
such [word indistinct] 
  [Silajdzic] The meeting of ministers of the contact group of 
the Organization of Islamic Countries in Geneva on 17 January is 
certainly connected with this. The meeting will reexamine the 
efforts of the Organization of Islamic Countries in this 
direction. A new (?demand) could be set that direction. In any 
case, we are talking about a group of countries with 
exceptionally strong economic potential. It is possible to 
direct this potential in the direction of [word indistinct] the 
international community, in the direction of (?increasing) 
humanitarian aid, in which everyone is interested, when the 
roads in Bosnia-Herzegovina become free. There is plenty of 
aid, and aid could be sent if communications are free. [words 
indistinct] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sarajevo, Jan 13 (AFP) -- A Bosnian Government 
offensive launched Sunday [9 January] has made considerable 
inroads into the Croat-held pocket around the central Bosnian 
town of Vitez, a UN Protection Force spokesman said Thursday. 
  The mainly Moslem Government forces made a "considerable" 
advance Wednesday in an action designed to cut the enclave in 
two and cut the land route linking Vitez with Busovaca, another 
Croat-held enclave, Lt-Col Bill Aikman said. 
  Several points along the Vitez-Busovaca road were seized by 
government troops from the Croat Defence (HVO) Forces after 
heavy fighting, Aikman said. Fighting was continuing in the 
Vitez enclave early Thursday despite an announcement on 
Wednesday that Bosnian government and Croat leaders had agreed 
to work out the terms of a "total" ceasefire to become effective 
on Saturday. 
  Aikman said he did not know whether heavy Bosnian 
bombardment 
of the locality of Bila, north of Vitez, on Wednesday signalled 
the start of a new offensive. 
  Sarajevo radio said a helicopter of the regular Croatian 
Army 
fired several air-to-ground missiles at Bosnian civilian targets 
near Vitez and Novi Travnik Thursday. 
  Military activity in Bosnia-Herzegovina eased slightly on 
Wednesday, Aitken said, with Sarajevo enjoying a quieter day 
than in much of the preceding period. Serbs besieging the city 
fired 350 shells, and were targetted in return by 10 shells. 
Six people were killed in Sarajevo and 36 wounded, he said. 
  A spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Kris 
Janowski, complained meanwhile that Bosnian Serbs were 
practising bureaucratic obstructionism in order to prevent the 
sick and wounded being evacuated from government-held areas. 
  "The Serbs never openly say no, but they always find 
problems 
to drag things out," Janowski said, citing the cases of at least 
five people who died while waiting for Serb authorisation to be 
moved from the enclaves of eastern Bosnia. 
  The UNHCR also encountered difficulties with the Bosnian 
authorities in the government-held northern town of Tuzla, who 
were demanding that they should be allowed to make their own 
choice among the wounded of candidates for evacuation, Janowski 
said.

  [Text] Sarajevo, Jan 13 (AFP) -- Meanwhile Bosnian Croat 
HVO forces continued to prevent for the second day running a 
nine-truck aid convoy from entering the besieged Moslem town of 
Maglaj, UNHCR spokesman Janowski told journalists here. 
  The situation in the northern central town crammed with 
around 40,000 inhabitants and refugees was getting desperate, 
Janowski said, adding that no convoys had reached the town since 
October 25. Four U.S. planes dropped supplies over the town 
overnight Wednesday, UNPROFOR said. 
  The UNHCR convoy, which is carrying flour, sugar and 
medicine, is blocked at Novi Seher, around 10 kilometres (six 
miles) southwest of Maglaj, Janowski said. The town is 
surrounded on three sides by Bosnian Serb forces and on the 
fourth by HVO troops. 
  UNHCR official Larry Hollingworth was trying Thursday 
morning 
to negotiate a passage for the convoy with local HVO commanders. 
Bosnian Serb authorities had allowed the convoy to pass without 
hindrance, Janowski added. 
  The spokesman added that the hold-up had persuaded the UNHCR 
to delay the departure of another convoy destined for the Croat 
enclave of Zepce around 15 kilometres (nine miles) south of 
Maglaj.

<F P=106> [Mirza Sadikovic report from the 5th Corps of the </F>
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army] 
  [Excerpt] The unsuccessful offensive by the members of the 
so-called [Velika] Kladusa autonomy and the Chetniks from the 
SAO [Serbian autonomous region of] Krajina on the free territory 
of Bihac, that is, parts of the Cazin commune, has continued 
today. Mindlessly attacking the area around Buzim, the 
separatists have suffered a fresh defeat. In a strong 
counterattack, members of the 5th Corps of the Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina captured two companies of separatists, about 
200 of them, together with a large amount of equipment, 
ammunition, and weapons. 
  Not only have they suffered a fresh defeat in this region, 
but Fikret [Abdic]'s separatists have simply being routed in the 
region of (?Trzac). A significant amount of ammunition and 
equipment was captured in the fighting there. They could not do 
anything else but resort to artillery. Thus, the areas of 
Pecigrad, Skokovi, and Vitkovac are coming under constant fire, 
where further material damage has been caused to residential 
property. Some civilians have also been wounded. 
  The reports from this region on the consolidation of the 
situation are encouraging. The population are slowly retuning 
to their homes. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Belgrade, January 12 (TANJUG) -- Seven people were 
killed and 49 wounded in Tuesday's artillery attacks in 
Sarajevo, UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] reported on Wednesday. 
  Three civilians were killed in the Serb suburbs of Grbavica 
and Lukavica on Tuesday, Bosnian Serb Army sources said. 
  Commander of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) 
in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, General 
Francis Briquemont on Tuesday evening accused the Moslem forces 
loyal to Alija Izetbegovic of being the first to open artillery 
fire on Serb parts of the city immediately after U.N. envoy 
Yasushi Akashi had left the city. 
  However, foreign news agencies on Wednesday quoted his 
spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Bill Aikman as saying that the 
Moslem forces had only returned fire. 
  UNPROFOR reports show that the Moslem side on Tuesday fired 
200 shells while the Serb side responded with 600 grenades. 
  The Moslem side fired a great many shells from artillery 
positions in the vicinity of civilian objects in central 
Sarajevo, the French news agency AFP quoted Aikman as saying. 
  Bosnian Serb army sources have recently warned that the 
Moslems are using civilian facilities as military positions for 
attacks on serb positions. 
  The sources believe that the Moslem plan is to provoke the 
Serb forces to neutralize those positions in order to accuse the 
Serbs of shelling civilian facilities, including hospitals. 
  At the NATO summit in Brussels on Monday and Tuesday, the 
German delegation said there were proofs that the Moslem 
artillery had shelled the city airport late last week in order 
to prevent the departure of their leader Izetbegovic to Bonn for 
talks with President of the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia 
Franjo Tudjman. 
  In the area of Sarajevo, Moslem units continued unprovoked 
attacks on all Serb suburbs from various weapons, the Bosnian 
Serb army sources said.

  [Excerpt] A founding session of the City Committee of the 
Party of Democratic Action was held in Sarajevo today at which 
members of the Main and Executive Committees and president of 
the City Committee of the Party of Democratic Action were 
elected. Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, spoke at this session on the current 
political situation and the work and tasks of the party. Senada 
Cumurovic reports: 
  [Cumurovic] At the beginning of the festive part of the 
founding session of the City Committee of the Party of 
Democratic Action, Memhmet Alija Hadzic spoke about the previous 
work and activities of the party, such as, for instance, the 
work on the territorial organization of the town aimed at 
improving a better functioning of the organs of authority, the 
setting up of the Patriotic League, the provision of food, 
acquisition of arms, work on the creation and strengthening of 
the Army, and so forth. 
  Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, spoke at the founding session of the City 
Committee of the Party of Democratic Action on the party and the 
general political situation. He first spoke about staff issues 
in terms of the opening of the party for all those who want to 
fight for Bosnia-Herzegovina. The criterion for this, as 
Izetbegovic said, is support of the people. 
  [Izetbegovic] There are 20 months of difficult trials behind 
us. During these trials, some people have passed the test, some 
have not. Please remove those who have not passed the test from 
the (?party); do them a big favor. Therefore, the (?gradual) 
opening of the party [words indistinct]. There is another term 
-- that is, cleansing of the party of those who do not belong to 
it. 
  Regarding cleansing, all parties, and not only our party but 
all parties, (?are faced) with the constant problem of [having 
to choose] between the honest but unable and very able but 
extremely dishonest people. They are often in a dilemma as to 
what to do. In this dilemma concerning the honest but less 
able, and very able but almost certainly dishonest, deceitful, 
people, I would recommend you opt for the honest. 
  [Cumurovic] This meeting presented an opportunity for 
President Izetbegovic to comment on the remarks often addressed 
to him that he is striving for an Islamic republic in this 
region. 
  [Izetbegovic] I (?will) tell you clearly that I do not want 
an Islamic republic. However, I want Islam to be preserved in 
this region, [words indistinct]. I do not know why we should do 
that. We are illustrating here a European, a modern [words 
indistinct]. After all, we can go in that direction [words 
indistinct] we will not do that; this is not our policy, 
although I could say that [words indistinct] we should not do 
that. We will win, because we will not, because we will respect 
other people's religion, other nations, different political 
convictions, because we will try to be democrats in this grave 
situation. [sentence as heard] 
  [Cumurovic] Izetbegovic also spoke about his recent talks 
with Tudjman, saying the Croatian proposal could have been 
acceptable last year, before the crimes took place. Also, in 
the meantime, our army was founded and developed. President 
Izetbegovic told its leadership a few days ago the same things 
that he spoke about today. 
  [Izetbegovic] I ended that meeting with a recommendation to 
the soldiers and the officers. The recommendation was very 
short and amounted to the following: Be like the people you are 
(?protecting). 
  [Cumurovic] Izetbegovic ended his speech at the founding 
session of the City Committee of the Party of Democratic Action 
by commenting on the future organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
There is no integral Bosnia-Herzegovina without the Croats and 
the Serbs. The integral Bosnia-Herzegovina is desired by all 
Muslims, most Croats, and some Serbs. Here is what Izetbegovic 
said about the ways of arriving at the integral Bosnia. 
  [Izetbegovic] There are, in my view, two stages of the 
struggle. One stage is military, and the other is the stage of 
a political struggle for integration of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
What then? We should then create a democratic country in that 
part of Bosnia. 
  [Cumurovic] After the speech of Alija Izetbegovic, president 
of the Presidency, names of 85 members of the City Committee and 
the Executive Committee of the Party of Democratic Action were 
read out. Safet Halilovic was elected president of the City 
Committee. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Lieutenant General Niculae </F>
Spiroiu by Dorina Baesu; place and date not given: "It Is Not 
Important That We Should Gain Admittance, but Rather That No One 
Else Should Be Admitted First"] 
  [Text] [Baesu] There will soon be a government reshuffle. 
The hardliners within the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of 
Romania -- the ruling party] have mentioned you as one of the 
ministers that should be replaced. Have you noticed any signs 
that they are preparing for your deposal? 
  [Spiroiu] That statement was made some time ago by [PDSR 
Vice President and Senator Ion] Solcanu. I have never asked him 
why he said that, and I do not think I ever will. In any 
democratic system, the ruling parties have the right to set up 
the governmental teams; therefore, it is only natural that they 
should ask for various portfolios. 
  [Baesu] Did they request that you become a PDSR member? 
  [Spiroiu] No, never. But let me finish answering your first 
question. I learned that during the talks that were held on the 
government reshuffle, various parties requested the portfolio of 
defense [reference to the National Romanian Unity Party]. Aside 
from this, I have not noticed any other signs that they are 
preparing for my deposal and no one has tried to obstruct me in 
my work. 
  [Baesu] You and [Foreign Affairs Minister] Teodor Melescanu 
are the only ministers of the Vacaroiu cabinet surrounded by a 
certain kind of consensus. Despite the fact that you are a 
member of the PDSR government, [opposition leader] Emil 
Constantinescu recently stated that the CDR [Democratic 
Convention of Romania] will support you. Except for the 
aforementioned hard liners within the PDSR and [Greater Romania 
Party Chairman and Senator] Corneliu Vadim Tudor in his weekly 
ROMANIA MARE, no one else has attacked you. How do you explain 
this unusual situation of yours? 
  [Spiroiu] That is quite simple. Beginning in May of 1990, 
ever since I have been defense minister, my principal goal was 
to keep the armed forces out of the political struggle. We have 
been equidistant to every party and never flirted with any of 
them. As far as Senator Corneliu Vadim Tudor is concerned, the 
reason he is attacking me has nothing to do with politics. He 
has a brother who is a colonel in our forces and the senator 
asked me to promote him to the rank of general, something I 
rejected, as his brother does not meet the necessary 
preconditions. That is why the senator has been assaulting me. 
  [Baesu] Could it be that the consensus around your person is 
required by the parties' similar interests, namely that the 
country should join NATO, and that is why the opposition is also 
backing your efforts, especially considering the fact that the 
opposition believes you are a person who is liked in 
international circles. 
  [Spiroiu] They might really like me, considering that last 
year, eight defense ministers of NATO's European member states 
visited Romania. The activity of our ministry to implement 
reform is quite appreciated; that might be the reason of their 
having accepted me. 
  [Baesu] Does that acceptance also mean that NATO circles are 
manifesting a certain amount of interest in Romania? 
  [Spiroiu] The NATO countries are interested in seeing that 
Romania remains a stability factor in an area that is 
considerably tensioned. 
  [Baesu] Certain politicians of the opposition believe that 
our country will not be accepted as a full member of that body, 
among other things, owing to the current political regime. 
  [Spiroiu] In NATO circles, I have never heard anyone say 
that Romania should not be admitted because of that. This is an 
issue that depends on the decisions taken by the Atlantic 
Alliance regarding the admittance of new members. Their latest 
statement shows that for the time being, the extent to which 
they are prepared to expand the organization is the Partnership 
for Peace. At the Brussels summit meeting (of 9-10 January, 
editor's note), they will adopt a declaration regarding that 
partnership, which is not a collective relationship but rather a 
bilateral one. Every single Central and East European state may 
apply for and establish ties with NATO. There are a number of 
preconditions regarding the military body. Everything we 
currently do in our armed forces is done according to the plans 
elaborated by the North Atlantic Cooperation Council [NACC], 
which shows Romania's willingness to join the military 
structures of both the WEU [Western European Union] and NATO. 
  [Baesu] Of course Romania is willing, but will it ever be 
admitted? 
  [Spiroiu] For the time being, there is a consensus among 
them that the alliance is not prepared to admit any new members. 
  [Baesu] Is that delay too dangerous for us, considering 
especially how close we are to Russia? 
  [Spiroiu] It is our own interest to gain admittance as soon 
as possible. However, it is not important that we should gain 
admittance, but rather that no one should be discriminated 
against by admitting other Central and East European states 
first. We are struggling for a security area equally valid for 
all, without any discrimination, without establishing new 
boundaries. Of course, Russia's interests should be observed 
and we should avoid creating the impression that our approaching 
the alliance is done because of our hostile stance regarding 
that country. 
  [Baesu] What would happen if they would decide for a 
two-step admittance of the East European countries to NATO? 
What if Hungary, Czechia, Slovakia, and Poland are admitted 
first? 
  [Spiroiu] A two-step admittance to the NATO structures would 
generate insecurity, instability, suspicion, and it would 
generate a feeling of isolation that would bolster the 
conservative forces, such as those in Russia, for example. 
  [Baesu] Under such circumstances, could we be forced to 
strike an alliance with Russia? 
  [Spiroiu] Such a thing is out of the question. For the time 
being, in my opinion, military alliances are already 
old-fashioned things and after the Paris Charter was signed, 
they have no real purpose. NATO itself, which we wish to join, 
has lost its role as an organization opposing the Warsaw Pact. 
This is another NATO that has developed a third dimension for 
itself, namely to support the countries that have set out on the 
way of democratic reforms. 
  [Baesu] Still, the emergence of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy on the 
Russian political scene does not pose any peril for us? Mikhail 
Gorbachev has recently stated that he [Zhirinovskiy] is 
supported by the KGB. What are the consequences for Romania of 
the apparition of this person, whom some people call the second 
Hitler? 
  [Spiroiu] Mr. Gorbachev has hopefully made that statement on 
the basis of some evidence. I, as a military person, cannot 
make any similar assertions, as I lack the evidence. However, 
on the basis of what I do know, I can assert the following 
things: No real security system can be achieved with the 
democratization of Russia. That is why we morally support the 
democratization process taking place in Russia. Zhirinovskiy is 
the representative of extremist and conservative forces. His 
apparition could be dangerous if he comes to power and if he had 
a much larger audience than the one he currently has. Heaven 
forbid he should be supported more massively, because if he 
becomes the ruler of the country, that would strengthen the 
forces that are striving to rebuild the Soviet empire with all 
its imperial characteristic features. Thus, that would not only 
endanger the security of the neighboring states but world 
security as well.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky </F>
by Tibor Kis; place and date not given: "The Program of 
Partnership for Peace Is A Big Step Forward"] 
  [Text] Hungary welcomes the Partnership for Peace program, 
and Budapest regards it as an extremely progressive concept from 
the viewpoint of accelerating the European integration of this 
region. The Hungarian side sees long-term possibilities in the 
cooperation of the Visegrad group. Among other things, these 
were the subjects in Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky's 
interview for NEPSZABADSAG. 
  [Kis] A real war of statements was waged in Central Europe 
in the days and weeks preceding the summit in Brussels and 
Prague; a lot of attacks were also directed at the program of 
Partnership for Peace. It seems that the Hungarian politics 
tried to distance itself from this heated campaign. What was 
the reason for this restraint? 
  [Jeszenszky] Partly, perhaps, our being well informed. For 
us, the program of Partnership for Peace has never seemed 
alarming. From the very beginning, we saw something positive in 
this concept. We saw the great step forward this represents, 
even compared with the NATO position of six months ago. In the 
past year, I often met with NATO leaders and the foreign 
ministers or other political leaders of NATO members under 
formal or less-formal circumstances. Therefore, I had the 
opportunity to see this evolution. In addition, it is also well 
known that Hungary has good relations with the current 
leadership in Russia. As a historian, I am also aware of the 
huge responsibility of the U.S. leaders, and of the great stakes 
involved. Today it is really imaginable that, as a result of 
the changes of 1989-1990, a change could take place in the 
division of Europe and a dividing line move further to the East 
than previously, not only the welfare line, but also the 
political line. However, this would be the worse alternative 
compared to the creation of a more uniform European thinking. 
All the more so because, for us, the relations with Russia and 
Ukraine are extremely important both politically and 
economically. Taking all this into consideration, the peace 
partnership is a big stake. This idea provides a rather 
progressive program, and if we succeed in implementing this, 
mankind will gain much more than just security guarantees for a 
few Central European countries that will make the democratic 
process irreversible, and this is very important for us. In 
other words, this is a program that provides both short-term and 
long-term promising prospects. This is why Hungary did not show 
disappointment and refrained from using a demanding tone. 
Besides, I have repeatedly spoken abroad in recent weeks, so 
the Hungarian position is well known there. In addition, what 
we heard in recent days was even more reassuring; the U.S. 
leadership cannot be accused of any kind of naivete; nor can it 
be accused of not being aware of the possible dangers and 
failing to prepare for worse scenarios as well. 
  [Kis] To what extent does this program fulfill the previous 
Hungarian expectations? 
  [Jeszenszky] This fulfills the expectations of the Hungarian 
Government, and we see a serious development in the NATO 
position. A lot is said about differentiation. They often 
mention a process of self-selection in connection with the 
countries involved, and this is an advantage for us in any case. 
This approach represents a faster road toward full membership 
or toward very close cooperation for countries that are ready 
for this both militarily and politically, countries where 
democracy is stable and political control over the Army is 
obvious. The quality of cooperation will count, and political 
compatibility is as important as the military compatibility of 
the countries involved. 
  [Kis] From the Hungarian viewpoint, which part of the 
program is the most essential? 
  [Jeszenszky] I would stress the fact that the informal 
confidence that has developed in the last three and a half years 
is now becoming formal through this program, because there will 
be a Hungarian representative in the NATO in the framework of 
this Partnership for Peace. There will also be a Hungarian 
officer at NATO military headquarters, and the daily contacts 
that will emerge as a result will make us even more a partner in 
the eyes of the Western public and the Western political 
leaders. The warning that emerged during the last talks is 
important: A security guarantee voiced as a political intention 
is not sufficient, because the NATO statute makes it a matter of 
sovereign decisions of the member states how they act in case of 
a conflict; of course, there is an obligation of common defense 
but, within this, individual governments have considerable 
freedom of decision. 
  [Kis] The debate on the Partnership for Peace made a real 
test of the Visegrad cooperation. In your opinion, to what 
extent is the Visegrad Group in a crisis? 
  [Jeszenszky] The Visegrad cooperation is not threatened by 
the Partnership for Peace. This program does not mean any kind 
of conflict. It is a secondary issue whether we coordinate our 
positions on the program, we make common statements, or issue 
separate statements. There has been no basic difference between 
the Visegrad countries regarding their relations with NATO. 
However, if we speak about the Visegrad group in a wider sense, 
my opinion is that, no matter what others say, this cooperation 
does not depend on the intention of some political leaders, 
although the role of our late prime minister was considerable. 
Actually, the Visegrad cooperation lies on history, geography, 
and the common difficult experiences of our recent history, as 
well as on our common goals and current situation. In this 
respect, these three or four countries are close to each other. 
Given the fact that this cooperation lies on facts and not on 
political intentions, I am optimistic in the long run too. I am 
convinced that the Visegrad cooperation -- Central Europe in a 
wider sense -- creates a unity that will continue to preserve a 
lot of its culture and bilateral relations in the future too. 
Actually, it was the Cold War that divided the original Central 
Europe and this Cold War brought iron curtains and dividing 
walls between individual countries. It is very difficult to 
dismantle the dividing walls between various societies. This 
explains the fact that there are occasional regressions in 
political relations and tones. However, in the final analysis, 
objective factors determine the common fate and cooperation of 
these countries. 
  [Kis] In your opinion, when can Hungary's NATO membership 
become timely? According to what scenario can this membership 
become a reality? 
  [Jeszenszky] Regarding the European Union, one can predict 
more or less realistically. In the case of the NATO, it is more 
difficult to predict, because many things could happen that 
might accelerate or slow down the process. However, in my 
opinion, the timing of formal membership is not the really 
essential thing. The essential thing is that Hungary should 
advance this process and fulfill the practical cooperation and 
political dialogue. In this respect, Hungary is already a NATO 
member in a certain sense. General Shalikashvili also stressed 
that they have the closest relations with the Hungarian Army in 
this region. Of course, we do not want to outdistance others or 
gain advantages at others' detriment, because Central Europe 
will actually live or fall together. However, we gladly accept 
the pioneering role that we have fulfilled in many respects so 
far. We have nothing against others if they can advance 
together with us. We can be quite satisfied with Hungary's 
relations with the West, including the United States and NATO, 
and both the personal and institutional relations have become 
very deep since I first stepped into NATO Headquarters in the 
summer of 1990. This is quite reassuring for us.

  [Text] Prior to the Prague summit, Geza Jeszenszky held the 
regular weekly foreign affairs' spokesman press briefing. Then 
the foreign minister answered the question of Jozsef Barath: 
  [begin recording] [Barath] Mr. Minister, at your press 
briefing you welcomed the results of the NATO summit. Did 
anything happen there which could not have been expected or 
taken for granted in advance? 
  [Jeszenszky] There were worries and hopes in connection with 
the summit. In my view, the latest developments, the Brussels 
NATO summit, and the statement and document adopted there made 
the hopes come true. It is certain that more could have been 
envisaged and there were many who expected more. However, 
realistically, nobody expected that Hungary or a few other 
countries would be admitted to NATO in January. For that one 
has to be prepared; among other things, an appropriately trained 
army is necessary both professionally and in language, 
competible weaponry is needed, etc., thus this is a process. 
  I think that in the present international situation, NATO 
gave an appropriate answer. It tried to give an encouraging 
answer to the peoples of Central Europe for their worries, it 
offers a prospect for them regarding their membership and at the 
same time, it is trying to tackle a bigger question, namely, how 
to avoid new conflict between the superpowers, how to avoid 
Russia becoming a new danger for Europe or for us. 
  So it is quite clear to me that the Partnership for Peace 
program tries to influence the world developments to follow a 
favorable direction. Thus, in the case of Russia, it tries to 
support democracy by this means, and to ensure that Russia 
should not consider NATO an enemy, or should not consider NATO's 
expansion as a provocation, but to make Russia see that a road 
is open for cooperation here. [end recording]

  [Text] Warsaw, 12 Jan--Polish President Lech Walesa, who is 
in Prague, met on Wednesday morning [12 January] with Czech 
President Vaclav Havel and U.S. President Bill Clinton, 
according to the President's Press Office [BPP]. 
  During his talks with the president of the Czech Republic, 
Walesa noted that what counted to him and to Poland, above all 
else, were facts rather than declarations. The most important 
issue facing us now is to translate declarations into facts. 
Declarations by themselves are not enough; they are often 
reminiscent of "wearing a necktie in a coffin", the president of 
the Polish Republic said. 
  It was agreed during the talks that NATO could have done 
more 
for our countries than it has. Speaking about both countries' 
efforts to enter NATO, President Havel added that he has been 
doing through diplomatic means the exact same things President 
Walesa has been doing at full volume. It was also agreed during 
the talks that the latest Russian actions had the 
characteristics of blackmail against Europe and the world. 
  Speaking about the "Partnership for Peace", the president of 
the Polish Republic remarked that it was a road to NATO that 
would, however, need to materialize very quickly. We should 
already be working on "clarifying" our relations with NATO. We 
can also count on each another in the event of external danger, 
Walesa said, summing up the talks. 
  The talks between Walesa and U.S. President Bill Clinton, 
which took place in a very good and relaxed atmosphere, mainly 
concerned issues connected with security, NATO, and the economy, 
the BPP statement reports. 
  President Clinton said that security issues also depend on 
economic issues. America is opening up to Poland, he added. 
Some had interpreted the "Partnership for Peace" as a 
compromise between doing nothing and NATO membership. For me, 
this plan is a way of reaching the North Atlantic pact. We need 
time for this to happen, however. Poland's security is in the 
interests of the United States, President Clinton noted. He 
also emphasized that he did not want to create new divisions. 
  Walesa emphasized the role of the United States as a 
superpower responsible for what is happening in the world. 
Speaking about declarations, he drew attention to our country's 
negative historical experiences. He recalled, among other 
things, President Yeltsin's declaration made during his official 
visit to Poland last year. It has become no more than a paper 
declaration, the Polish president added. 
  "We are not anti-Russian. It is not Poland, it is Europe 
that should be afraid of Russia." We merely want Europe to 
integrate with our area as quickly as possible, Walesa 
concluded. Walesa invited the president of the United States to 
pay a visit to our country in May this year. 
  Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, who took part in the 
meeting, raised economic problems first and foremost, drawing 
attention to the need for a "partnership for development", the 
BPP told PAP. 
  "On the path toward making the Partnership for Peace a 
reality, we need a partnership for development." The BPP 
statement reports that this was one of the main arguments in 
Prime Minister Pawlak's address during the Prague talks between 
the Polish delegation led by President Lech Walesa and President 
Clinton. 
  The prime minister noted that he actually interprets the 
term 
of "Partnership for Development" as a stimulation of economic 
development with the United States and Western Europe. He 
stressed that there are still too many barriers in this respect. 
  "Now that the Uruguay round of GATT talks has been closed, 
we now have to concentrate on eliminating many restrictions that 
remain outside the tariff. Their place must be taken by offers 
of mutually complimentary projects", the prime minister said. 
He spoke with approval about the statement by President 
Clinton, who spoke in Brussels about a need for greater openness 
by the West toward economic cooperation with Central and Eastern 
Europe. 
  Pawlak stated that economic cooperation constitutes a 
condition for genuine integration of Europe and for its 
security. During the meeting, a full unanimity with President 
Clinton with regard to views on this subject was noted. The 
U.S. President recalled his speeches calling upon the leaders of 
Western European countries to eliminate barriers in trade and 
appeals to businessmen to invest in Central and Eastern European 
countries. 
  Economic matters were also a subject at Prime Minister 
Pawlak's meeting with Czech Republic Prime Minister Vaclav 
Klaus. The Polish prime minister stated that achieving NATO 
membership must be linked with economic development, and 
cooperation between the two countries has a significant role to 
play. Pawlak declared readiness to intensify concrete working 
contacts that would produce, for instance, the abolition of 
barriers in trade exchange, would ensure the fluidity of mutual 
trade clearing, or would bring about the intensification of 
cross-border cooperation, the BPP reported. 
  "It is not guarantees that create facts but facts that make 
guarantees possible" was the leitmotif of all of President 
Walesa's meetings in Prague today. The BPP reported that the 
issue of the future of the Visegrad Group countries in the 
system of European security was raised. 
  In the afternoon, Walesa met Hungarian President Arpad Goncz 
and Slovak President Michal Kovac [words indistinct]. The main 
subject of both meetings was cooperation, both bilateral and 
regional, between our countries, and the future of all countries 
of the group in NATO structures. 
  According to President Goncz, Hungary, which feels "war 
breathing down its neck" in view of the proximity of the Balkan 
conflict, is anxious for quick ties with NATO, although it is 
aware that the speed of our march toward the pact depends on the 
development of the situation in Russia. President Walesa again 
stressed that the most important thing is an overall vision of 
the future, while individual interests are less important, the 
BPP statement says. 
  Appraising cooperation between Poland and Hungary, President 
Goncz admitted that it is inadequate today. There is a chance 
to stimulate cooperation, especially within the Carpathian 
region. Primarily this concerns economic, including trade, 
cooperation. "The free-trade skeleton should be fleshed out 
somewhat," President Goncz said. 
  It was established that Polish-Hungarian talks will be 
continued during an official visit to Poland by the president of 
the Hungarian Republic, who is going to be a guest of the 
president of the Polish Republic. 
  Poland is also expecting a visit by Slovak President Kovac, 
who during today's Prague meeting with President Walesa thought 
cooperation in the Visegrad Group needs new stimuli and a new 
driving force, although there is no need to build institutions. 
With regard to our relations with NATO, he noted there will 
still be a need for talks and contacts between the ministers of 
defense, foreign affairs, and the economic departments of the 
Group's states. They will map out the next stages of our 
activities on this issue. 
  President Kovac sought reasons for the weak bilateral 
cooperation between Poland and Slovakia. First and foremost, he 
attributed it to the short period of existence of an independent 
Slovakia and in the stereotypes from the previous era of 
thinking only about yourself. We are linked by many things, 
however. "An important element linking our countries is 
Catholicism," said President Kovac. Today there is a chance for 
our cooperation to become authentic, rather than being conferred 
by Moscow. Both regional and bilateral cooperation is 
necessary. This was also mentioned by President Walesa, who 
said that NATO will come to us itself if we show that we are 
strong through the strength of our economy, the strength of our 
stability." 
  The presidents' meeting in Prague ended with a ceremonial 
dinner given by President Havel, attended by the heads of state 
of the Visegrad Group states, writes the BPP.

  [Text] An exchange of prisoners of war took place this 
afternoon at the UN Protection Force checkpoint near Lipovac. 
The Croatian side handed over 11 prisoners, mainly members of 
the Stit [Shield] terrorist group. One of the prisoners refused 
to go over to the Serbian side. In addition to eight people 
from the Sombor group, another five prisoners were released from 
Serbian prisons. Thus the agreement signed by Panic and Franjo 
Greguric in Budapest in 1992 has been realized.

  [Text] Yasushi Akashi, the UN Secretary General Butrus 
Ghali's special envoy and UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] chief 
coordinator, stressed in his talks with the local press that at 
the moment, UNPROFOR's main problem in Croatia was the 
stabilization of the cease-fire, following which one can embark 
on the demilitarization of UN Protected Area zones and the 
implementation of other tasks within the protection force's 
mandate. The problem of the return of refugees, in his view, 
must wait for the materialization of a peace agreement. 
  Akashi stressed that the challenges facing UNPROFOR in 
Croatia were greater than those in Cambodia where he had worked 
with a UN peace mission. For, he said, the protection force in 
Croatia us working both on achieving and keeping peace. 
UNPROFOR can do more than it has done so far, Akashi said and 
added that Chapter Six of the UN Charter, under which his 
mandate in Croatia has taken place, provides sufficient 
potential, which have not been harnessed yet. 
  In this context, Akashi expects firm cooperation with the 
Croatian authorities and hopes that some past problems in their 
relations will be ironed out. Today, as he announced, Akashi 
will talk to Ambassador Gerd Ahrens, a mediator between the 
Croatian authorities and UN Protected Areas. The implementation 
in practice of the economic and communications reintegration of 
these areas in Croatia as a whole will be the main topic of 
their talks.

  [Text] Belgrade, Jan 12 (TANJUG) -- The Foreign Ministry of 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on Wednesday [12 January] 
warned of an escalation of incidents on the Yugoslav-Albanian 
border provoked by the Albanian side and in which the territory 
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has been violated. The 
statement of the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry was published on the 
latest incident which took place on January 10 and in which deep 
in Yugoslav territory an Albanian citizen lost his life after 
illegally crossing the border. 
  A similar incident occurred on January 3 when an Albanian 
citizen was killed after he failed to respect the order of the 
Yugoslav border patrol following an illegal crossing to Yugoslav 
territory. The authorities in Belgrade accused Tirana of bearing 
full responsibility for the incident. With the aim of realizing 
its greater Albanian territorial aspirations towards the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia, the Albanian leadership in a calculated 
manner incites illegal crossings of the Yugoslav-Albanian border 
disregarding the safety of its own citizens, it was said in a 
statement of the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry published on 
Wednesday. 
  The statement assessed that the policy of the Albanian 
government was being confirmed by the continual provoking of 
border incidents. This policy is aimed at relativizing the 
existence of the state border of the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia, realizing greater Albanian pretensions and causing 
tension and destabilization in the broader region of the 
Balkans, the statement added. The Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia is strongly determined to energetically protect its 
sovereignty and territorial integrity, it was underscored in the 
statement which expressed Yugoslavia's readiness for development 
of good-neighbourly relations with Albania. 
  The Yugoslav authorities have on a number of ocassions 
warned 
Tirana to strictly control its border and not permit illegal 
crossings of Albanian citizens to Yugoslavia.

  [Text] Belgrade, Jan 12 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Prime Minister 
Radoje Kontic and the premiers of the Yugoslav Republics of 
Serbia and Montenegro, Nikola Sainovic and Milo Djukanovic, on 
Wednesday evening [12 January] backed up an economic recovery 
programme drawn up by a team of Yugoslav experts and agreed to 
start implement the measures contained in it as of next week. 
Yugoslavia desperately needs such a programme to counter the 
effects of an airtight international blockade and monster 
inflation which in December alone reached one million percent. 
  The U.N. Security Council imposed tough sanctions on 
Yugoslavia in late May of 1992 for its alleged involvement in 
civil war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Kontic, Sainovic and Djukanovic were agreed that the 
anti-inflation and stabilization programme, due to be launched 
on January 17, would ensure an economic independence to the 
country and open prospects for recovery on the basis of 
market-economy principles, the Yugoslav Information Ministry 
said in a statement. The Yugoslav Government on Wednesday 
generally upheld the programme but insisted on some corrections 
and amendments, the statement added. The programme focuses on 
curbing hyperinflation and ensuring monetary stability as a 
precondition for reviving production and improving the living 
standards of the population, the Yugoslav Government said. It 
also said that in the conditions of international sanctions, 
financial backing for the programme should be primarily ensured 
from domestic sources rather than from foreign ones. This 
should not stop actions, however, for deblocking Yugoslav assets 
frozen in foreign banks, settlement of claims that Yugoslavia 
has towards other countries and conclusion of credit and other 
financial arrangements to support the programme, the Federal 
Government said. 
  The government of Serbia on Wednesday backed the programme, 
while the government of Montenegro said on Tuesday that it 
should be used as a basis for seeking how to surmount the 
present economic difficulties and suggested a series of 
alterations. In a letter to the Federal prime minister whose 
content was published on Wednesday, Montenegrin Premier 
Djukanovic said that the programme did not fully take into 
account the effects of the blockade, that it was better suited 
to an open economy and that it implied backing of foreign 
capital. 
  Another shortcoming of the programme, the Montenegrin 
Government said, is that it offers no complete answer as to how 
to revive production and the commodities' market and how to 
mitigate the acute social problems.

  [Text] Belgrade, January 11 (TANJUG) -- The International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) will be unable to participate in the drawing 
up of the economic programme of the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia because of the "current circumstances," the 
organization has informed Yugoslav Prime Minister Radoje Kontic. 
  The director of the first IMF European department said in a 
letter that the organization was aware of the grave economic 
situation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and especially 
of the need to focus on the settling of the serious economic 
problems but that the circumstances did not allow it to help 
Yugoslavia in its efforts. On December 28, Kontic asked the IMF 
to help draw up a new Yugoslav stablization programme. 
  The Yugoslav Government has in the meantime completed its 
own 
economic programme whose essence has not yet been explained to 
the public. A stabilization programme is urgently needed 
because Yugoslavia is currently under a complete economic 
blockade while its rampant inflation reached the official figure 
of one million percent in December. 
  In May 1992, the United Nations Security Council imposed 
tough economic sanctions against Yugoslavia accusing it of being 
involved in the civil war among Moslems, Serbs and Croats in the 
neighbouring former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. As 
part of the economic sanctions, Yugoslavia's membership to the 
imf has been frozen. In conclusion, the IMF expressed hope in 
the letter that the circumstances would in the future allow the 
organization to open talks on support to Yugoslavia's 
stabilization programme.

  [Text] Belgrade, January 12 (TANJUG) -- The Russian 
Government's humanitarian delivery to the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia which arrived in Belgrade on Tuesday [11 January] is 
only the first in a series of planned humanitarian actions, 
Russian Government official Yuri Badrov told a press conference 
in Belgrade on Wednesday. The shipment includes 20 tonnes of 
baby food and two tonnes of medicaments. 
  Head of the Russian ministry for emergency situations Valery 
Shuykov said the action was a manifestation of the Russian 
people's wish to help the Yugoslavs at their time of need. The 
hospitality and gratitude which we felt from the moment we 
stepped on the ground of your great country is indescribable, he 
said. This was a second humanitarian delivery which the United 
Nations Sanctions Committee has lately approved without delay, 
in only six days. The first was sent by the Greek government. 
  The committee has so far prevented this kind of assistance 
and we are grateful to the Russian government and the embassy in 
Belgrade for investing great efforts to ensure that the 
humanitarian supplies reach our country, said commissioner for 
refugees of the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia Dobrica Vulovic. 
Humanitarian supplies are exempted from the regime of sanctions 
which was imposed against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 
May 1992 because of its alleged involvement in the civil war in 
the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina but 
humanitarian deliveries sent to Yugoslavia have nevertheless 
been delayed owing to petty bureaucracy practiced by the 
sanctions committee. 
  As a result of the tough economic sanctions, the population 
of Yugoslavia and over 700,000 refugees are currently on the 
verge of total poverty because the country lacks the most 
essential products, medicaments and fuels for heating 
apartments, schools and refugee centres during winter months.

<F P=106> [S.Z. attributed report: "`The Authorities are Resorting to </F>
Violence'"] 
  [Text] Belgrade -- The Democratic Party of Serbia [DSS] 
has warned the public that, in the period following the 
elections, prominent members of the party are increasingly being 
attacked. 
  According to a statement issued by the DSS Information 
Service, the chairman of the Communal Council in Vrsac was 
forced to defend his property himself after his business 
premises had been broken into several times and the police had 
failed to react. In Bujanovac, a DSS parliamentary candidate 
was brutally attacked and injured by Goran Veljkovic, son of the 
local strongman, Socialist Party of Serbia deputy Randjel 
Veljkovic, while in Surdulica -- claims the statement -- the 
local authorities have selectively and illegally seized the 
business premises belonging to the wife of the DSS Communal 
Council chairman in this town. 
  All these cases show -- the statement concludes -- that the 
authorities, instead of solving the vital problems that they 
have caused, are increasingly resorting to violence.

  [Text] Belgrade, January 13 (TANJUG) -- Nearly two million 
Belgrade residents could not buy bread Thursday morning [13 
January] as the city's central bakery went on strike. The 
bakers demanded they be paid in keeping with the defined minimum 
wages, the striking committee said. Bread deliveries were made 
only to hospitals and the Army. Negotiations were underway with 
the representatives of the authorities and if an accord was 
reached during the morning hours, the bakers would normalize 
production in the course of the day. 
  The strike of bakers, something even the oldest Belgraders 
do 
not remember, was only one in a series of strikes that hit the 
Yugoslav capital late last and early this year and which came as 
a result dissatisfaction with extremely low wages. Severe 
sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council in late May 1992 
against Yugoslavia over its alleged involvement in the civil war 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina threatened the living standard of some 
10.8 million people with galloping hyperinflation which 
literally devalued any wages by the hour and on the other hand 
invited spiralling price hikes.

  [Text] [Announcer] Since the time when health 
institutions were usurped by the Serbian regime, the health 
situation of the Albanian population in Kosova has been 
continuously deteriorating. Regarding the way health protection 
functions under the conditions of occupation, let us follow the 
report by correspondent Ramadan Mucolli: 
  [Mucolli] Those few studies that have so far been carried 
out regarding the health situation in the republic of Kosova 
have given distressing results. In several areas of the 
republic, the New Researchers Association has registered a great 
number of people sick with tuberculosis, jaundice, scabies, and 
other deficiency diseases. 
  A global reflection of the people's health situation is done 
even in some other cases, but very little has been done to cure 
the sick, and even less to eliminate the causes of these 
diseases. A bit more organized work has been done in schools, 
where several actions have been undertaken to cure pupils sick 
with scabies and to eliminate lice. 
  However, the organization of such actions from one case to 
another does not mean that an independent health system has been 
created in the republic of Kosova. The establishment of 
outpatient clinics for the poorest strata of the population 
presently serves only as a cover for the health organizations 
and associations. Even today, these associations have no draft 
program at all for setting up and creating health institutions 
to cure serious, chronic, and acute diseases. 
  With more consistent work, setting up such institutions is 
not an unrealizable project. Furnishing them with equipment and 
supplying with herbs and necessary items can be done with the 
help of international humanitarian associations and 
organizations, which are ever more present in Kosova. However, 
to set up these institutions, it is necessary to manifest a more 
serious approach and commit oneself right away, without 
improvisations and baseless justifications.

  [Excerpt] Novi Sad, 13 Jan (TANJUG) -- Vojvodina farmers 
failed to take advantage of the exceptionally favorable weather 
conditions, not recorded for a long time, to deep-plough almost 
1 million hectares of land in preparation for spring sowing. 
The main reason is the lack of fuel which the farmers expected 
to receive immediately after the autumn harvest. The province's 
Secretariat for Agriculture, the Vojvodina Chamber of Economy, 
and the Vojvodina Cooperative Union note that both the federal 
and the republic's government have, on several occasions, been 
asked to secure urgent diesel fuel deliveries but with to avail.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Viktor Krejci </F>
in Prague; date not given: "`The Foreign Policy Card Must Not 
Be a Substitute for the Domestic Card'"] 
  [Text] Polish President Lech Walesa said in an interview 
in yesterday's LIDOVE NOVINY that he is disappointed and 
disturbed by the course of action adopted by Prague, which, 
according to him, insisted that each country meet separately 
with President Clinton and that no joint communique be issued. 
Apparently, if -- as Lech Walesa said -- the talks end in 
failure, it will be necessary to say that this was the fault of 
the organizers. The Polish president also said that he had 
proposed to Prime Minister Klaus that he deliver a joint 
statement on behalf of all four countries, but, apparently, this 
suggestion was not "taken up." In this connection, we asked 
Prime Minister Klaus for an interview. 
  [Krejci] Prime Minister, would you care to comment on the 
statements made by President Walesa? 
  [Klaus] First, I would like to state quite unequivocally 
that the Czech side is not the organizer of this meeting. I 
think that certain of our neighbors and partners have either 
simply forgotten this or they do not want to hear it. We did 
not come up with the idea that President Clinton should come 
from Brussels and brief the Central European countries on the 
outcome of the U.S. initiative in NATO. We have -- of course -- 
absolutely no power to do this and we have even less power to 
persuade the U.S. Administration that this meeting should be 
held in Prague. This was solely the initiative of the U.S. 
side, and we can only say that we were glad to accept it. This 
means there can be no suggestion at all of any organizing on our 
part. 
  As far as the Visegrad countries drafting a joint communique 
is concerned, I do not know if there is a sufficient consensus 
of interests and views for this. I do not think it is possible 
to place the cart before the horse; this means that, first of 
all, it is necessary to have concurring views and only then can 
a communique be drafted by simple means. Unfortunately, 
however, this is not the situation. The term joint interests 
cannot be used to describe the maximal interests of one country. 
Only the highest common denominator of the interests of the 
four Visegrad countries can be a joint interest. The Czech side 
certainly does not act like a bottleneck or is the one to lower 
the common denominator. 
  [Krejci] Could you somehow specify the diversity of 
interests that you mentioned? 
  [Klaus] We do not measure the closeness of cooperation by 
the number of summits involving heads of state or foreign 
ministers, but by real tangible deeds and, in this case, it 
seems obvious to me that the most significant deed so far has 
been the creation of CEFTA, or the Central European Free Trade 
Zone, while the bottleneck blocking the intensification of this 
free zone, the speeding up of its completion, and the inclusion 
of a larger number of commodities in this free trade zone is not 
the Czech Republic. It is, on the other hand, the side that 
constantly asks its partners for more effective cooperation. 
  [Krejci] How do these diverse interests manifest themselves 
with regard to entry into NATO? 
  [Klaus] It is not my place to analyze the interests of 
Poland, Hungary, or Slovakia. I simply do not want -- and the 
Czech side is not doing this -- the foreign policy card to be 
played as a substitute for the domestic policy card. I am a 
little concerned, however, that this is what we are beginning to 
see in some of the Visegrad countries. 
  [Krejci] After the Slovak Republic paid its debt in the 
clearing account with the Czech Republic, this debt was incurred 
again as you predicted last month. How will the government 
proceed in this regard? 
  [Klaus] The government will proceed precisely in accordance 
with the agreement concluded on clearing relations between the 
Czech Republic and Slovakia, this means, that if a debt is 
incurred, it is a condition that it be repaid in hard currency 
by the middle of the following month. Nothing more and nothing 
less. I am pleased that when this situation arose for the first 
time there was no hitch. Of course, we will refine the clearing 
agreement; however, we will not increase the margin. 
  On the other hand, I think that the various devaluation 
shifts have more of a long-term than a short-term effect, so it 
is not out of the question that balanced relations between the 
Czech and Slovak economies in foreign trade will be achieved 
earlier than it may seem.

solved in a few days and that Croatia would get electricity in 
conformity with the technical possibilities of the power plant,

other things, the following: 
  [Begin Sinovcic recording in Serbo-Croatian] Whatever is 
produced at any moment, the Croatian electricity board is going 
to take 50 percent of. [end recording] 
  Therefore, Croatia plans to help itself from the system, 
irrespective of the Slovene Government bans. This is 
technically possible, but since our duty officers can register 
such unauthorized use, it is obvious that this will be in 
violation of the agreed exchange.

  [Text] Belgrade, January 13 (TANJUG) -- Possible NATO air 
strikes against Bosnian Serb positions would "directly threaten" 
the safety of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) on 
the ground, a senior officer of the Bosnian Serb army has 
warned. He also rejected a possible opening of the airport in 
Tuzla. 
  "Let them bomb (us) but it will directly threaten (the 
safety 
of) UNPROFOR units and the Moslem and Croat forces who are 
deployed close to Serb positions throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina," 
Chief of the General Staff of the Bosnian Serb army General 
Manojlo Milovanovic told the Belgrade daily POLITIKA on Thursday. 
  General Milovanovic described NATO's threat with air 
strikes, 
made at a summit in Brussels earlier this week, as a "scheme 
used too often when the objective was to impose unacceptable 
peace plans to the Bosnian Serb side," the paper writes. 
  General Milovanovic said the Serbs would not allow the 
activation of the airport in Tuzla, a Moslem-controlled town in 
the north-east of Bosnia, because it would only help continue 
the civil war which has already ravaged that former Yugoslav 
republic in the past 21 months. 
  "There are other airports in the territory of former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina," he said and pointed out that "under the 
pretext of sending humanitarian aid, Tuzla airport could easily 
turn into a huge depot of arms sent primarily from Islamic 
countries, which is a part of the U.S. plan." 
  Reacting to NATO's demand that the airport be opened, 
Bosnian 
Serb President Radovan Karadzic on Tuesday said it could not 
take place before the peace agreement was signed. 
  The Bosnian Serbs believe that the Tuzla airport would be 
used for arming the Moslems, like in the case of Sarajevo 
airport, which the Serb side handed over to UNPROFOR on July 1, 
1992. 
  The Bosnian Serbs maintain that the opening of the Tuzla 
airport at a time when peace is within sight and the signing of 
the peace plan at the Geneva talks next week realistic would 
only stir up war rather than secure peace.

  [Text] Warsaw, 12 Jan -- Following the end of the meeting 
of the leaders of the Visegrad countries with President Bill 
Clinton in Prague, President Lech Walesa has returned tonight to 
Poland. Asked by journalists when the Partnership for Peace, 
the American scheme which he called "small but beautiful" would 
become a "big step," the president said that it depended, among 
other things, on western public opinion as well as on how the 
mass media would present the participation of former communist 
states in NATO. 
  Asked whether he assessed the Prague meeting as a success, 
the president replied: "As the birth of new concepts which 
certainly proceed in the same direction, but the issue is the 
tempo and how advantage can be taken of certain situations which 
are appearing. I am such an activist who takes advantage of any 
suitable moment-- there are other strategists who just, step by 
step, follow the marked out path." 
  The president disagreed with an opinion that talks between 
Clinton and Boris Yeltsin in Moscow will decide on the real 
outcome of the Prague meeting. "Moscow does play a significant 
role on the map of the world and from that point of view we 
always have to take it into account," the president said. In 
the president's view the Visegrad Group does not have to "show 
its force" any more which was necessary when its member-states 
were demanding the dissolution of the Warsaw Treaty. As Walesa 
put it, today the time had come for hard work for the countries 
which belong to the Group, the work based upon the establishing 
of economic cooperation.

  [Text] Tirana, January 11 (ATA) -- Deputy socialist leader 
Dr. Servet Pellumbi and the leader of socialist parliamentary 
group Namik Dokle held a press conference January 10. Attending 
were reporters of Radio-TV, ATA, mass media and embassy 
officials. 
  A press release of the Presidency of the Socialist Party 
said 
that "currently the situation in the institutional aspect is 
characterized by care to have strong parties and weak democratic 
institutions which is expressed in the lack of constitution, 
blocking of local power by local administrations, corruption and 
violation of human rights." 
  Considering this situation the Socialist Party proposes: To 
observe human rights in all areas of social life, and to create 
political conditions for the opposition to operate in Albania. 
The press release requested the "immediate release of socialist 
leader, Deputy Fatos Nano, which would mark a turning point in 
the spirit of tolerance and understanding, and the observation 
of human rights." 
  In regard to the privatization of economy, it stressed that 
the Socialist Party insists "to continue privatization on the 
basis of legislation that should be endorsed by the parliament 
intending to re-distribute national assets to all citizens." 
  The press release also requested to "unblock the local power 
by drafting laws which guarantee the independence and 
superiority of the local government elected by the people over 
the administrative, central and local government." The 
statement also persisted that the parliament should devote 
priority to the Constitution of Albania and deemed it necessary 
to submit it to "the judgment and vote of the people and start 
the operation of a round table among parties." It again appealed 
to conduct special elections until next fall. 
  Asked about the meeting of socialist representatives with 
President Beriqialist [reference to Berisha followers] leaders 
replied that "no concrete result was attained in the meeting but 
according to them the meeting was characterized by a 
constructive spirit." In reply to a question about possible 
alliance with the Democratic Party, Mr. Pellumbi said that "it 
is not about alliance, but spirit of understanding, cooperation 
and dialogue." 
  Asked by a RD [RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE] reporter whether the 
democratic government has experienced only failures, Mr. 
Pellumbi mentioned among the achievements of the democratic 
government several laws passed by the parliament, the 
establishment of market economy, privatization in the 
countryside, freedom of people to express their opinions" but 
also stressed that the "press of the party in power does not 
raise problems and makes no criticism and it is inclined to 
speak in high-sounding words when it is about the government." 
  In reply to a question for factions in the fold of Socialist 
Party, Mr. Pellumbi said that the Socialist Party had no 
factions but diversity of opinions."

  [Text] Sofia, January 13 (BTA) -- Deputy Foreign Minister 
Todor Churov acquainted the Foreign Policy Committee of the 
National Assembly with the U.S. Partnership for Peace plan today. 
  According to MP Ivan Genov, deputy chairman of the Foreign 
Policy Committee for the Bulgarian Socialist Party, the 
Partnership for Peace offer is NATO's and the United States' 
compromise with the East because they do not want to isolate 
Russia from the processes of European and Euro-Atlantic 
security. The Partnership for Peace plan is a function of the 
relations among the great powers, he said. Mr. Genov absolutely 
disagrees with the statement that the U.S. initiative gives 
equal chances to the countries participating in it. The 
Partnership for Peace is based on bilateral contracts, which 
means a different approach to each country that is not a member 
of NATO, therefore the participants are placed on an utterly 
unequal footing, Mr. Genov stressed. 
  The Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) believes that 
Bulgaria should join the Partnership for Peace framework the 
soonest possible as this is the first important step towards 
integration into the structures of NATO, MP Yunal Lyutfi, deputy 
chairman of the Foreign Policy Committee for the DPS, said. In 
his opinion, the Partnership for Peace plan treats the countries 
on an equal footing without placing the Visegrad Four in a 
privileged position. Bulgaria's clearly and categorically 
stated desire for participation in the initiative is a serious 
guarantee for its national security, Mr. Lyutfi said. He said 
that a special group with the Council of Ministers was working 
on the programme of Bulgaria's participation in the Partnership 
for Peace. 
  The initiative gives a very good chance to each individual 
country participating in it to take the necessary steps for 
integration with NATO, MP Asparukh Panov, deputy chairman of the 
Foreign Policy Committee for the Union of Democratic Forces, 
said. He expressed his hope that the committee would actively 
participate and assist in the elaboration of a programme for 
joining the Partnership for Peace plan. It is the SDS MP's 
desire that rapid and resolute action be taken with this purpose 
in view. According to Mr. Panov, Bulgaria has always had an 
advantage over the Visegrad Four because of its geopolitical 
position. We do not have a common border with Russia but with 
two NATO member countries and the establishment of a future 
triangular of NATO member-states will contribute a lot to the 
stabilization of the Balkan region, Mr. Panov believes.

  [Excerpt] Sofia, January 13 (BTA) -- A plan for 
cooperation between the Defence Ministries of Bulgaria and 
Turkey in 1994 was signed here today by Corps Gen. Teoman Erkan, 
Turkish deputy minister of national defence, and Gen. Boyko 
Noev, Bulgarian deputy minister of defence. The plan envisages 
the exchange of visits by top military officials, the exchange 
of specialists, the training of officers at Turkish military 
academies, cooperation in the defence industry and military 
topography. 
  Today Gen. Erkan, who is on a three-day official visit to 
Bulgaria, was received by Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov. 
The defence ministers discussed a range of problems concerning 
the two countries' relations in a friendly atmosphere. They 
expressed the shared opinion that conducting cooperation in 
various fields contributes a lot to the promotion of 
good-neighbourly relations in the Balkans. 
  The frank conversation Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov 
and I had with Gen. Teoman Erkan gives enough ground to believe 
that there are no insoluble problems in Bulgarian-Turkish 
relations, Gen. Noev said on the Bulgarian National Radio. 
"There is political will, there is friendship and mutual trust 
between us," he said. "Today's meeting is a continuation of the 
policy of the Bulgarian and the Turkish Government aimed to 
advance further the friendly relations between the two 
countries," the deputy defence minister said. "The step we took 
today should be viewed both in the light of NATO's recent 
decisions and its summit and within the context of Bulgaria's 
strong desire for closer integration into the North Atlantic 
structures," Gen. Noev added. 
  It was stressed during the exchange of opinions that the 
effort of Bulgaria and Turkey to guarantee security in the 
Balkans and expand cooperation in all spheres is a model to 
follow which should be made known to still larger circles of the 
international community, the BULGARSKA ARMIYA paper wrote today.

<F P=106> ["Operation Safety Markedly Improved in Kozloduy N-Power </F>
Plant, William Montgomery Says" -- BTA headline] 
  [Text] Kozloduy, January 11 (BTA) -- The operation safety 
of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant has been substantially 
improved over the past two years. I am telling this as a person 
knowledgeable of this plant's problems of "those days" (the 
totalitarian rule), U.S. Ambassador to Bulgaria William 
Montgomery told journalists after his visit to the Kozloduy 
Power Plant. The specific improvements made in the power plant 
guarantee the operation safety of the different power units, Mr. 
Montgomery said. He also recalled the assistance the United 
States have provided, including $240,000 extended by the U.S. 
Agency for Trade and Development to help the research work and 
equip with computers the plant's training centre, and the 
support of the U.S. company Westinghouse. The plant is 
expecting a donation of two fire engines. 
  Power Engineering Committee Chairman Nikita Shervashidze 
stressed that the upgrading of the plant's operation safety was 
accomplished due to "the free assistance of Western experts and 
the support on the part of the United States." It is important 
to prove that the Kozloduy plant is "not at all the most 
hazardous power plant," Mr. Shervashidze went on to say. "With 
the experience we have, we want to show the world that we have 
no alternative abut use nuclear power, and that we can use 
nuclear power sources in compliance with the international 
safety requirements," Mr. Shervashidze said. 
  We are satisfied with the progress that has been made in 
Kozloduy, World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) Chairman 
Remi Carl told a BTA reporter after arriving in Sofia today. 
Mr. Remi said that though not completely up to the Western 
standards, the power plant has made a pronounced progress. Unit 
1 and 2, switched off in 1992, have been markedly improved, Mr. 
Carl said, voicing both WANO's opinion and that of French, 
German and Belgian institutes. 
  In his capacity as vice chairman of the French Electricity 
Company, Mr. Carl expressed readiness to provide funds for the 
upgrading of Unit 5 and 6. 
  Tomorrow the French guest will visit the Kozloduy Power 
Plant 
and will meet with National Electricity Company officials to 
discuss an agreement on the extending of funds for upgrading 
Unit 5 and 6, and a wholesale 9-year programme for improvement 
of the plant's operation safety. 
  Mr. Carl will also be received by Bulgarian Prime Minister 
Lyuben Berov.

  [Text] Sofia, January 13 (BTA) -- Electricite de France 
will finance projects to ensure the safe functioning of Units 
Five and Six of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Station over the next 
thirty years, according to a cooperation agreement signed today 
by Bulgaria's Power Engineering Committee, National Electricity 
Company, and Electricite de France. 
  The agreement envisages promotion of this country's power 
engineering sector, the upgrading of nuclear safety and of Units 
Five and Six at Kozloduy and financial management of bilateral 
cooperation. Electricite de France will not only invest in 
Bulgaria but also urge its European partners to provide 
financial aid to Bulgaria's power engineering. 
  Remy Carle, deputy director general of Electricite de France 
and president of the World Association of Nuclear Operators, 
told the press Units One and Two were in a very good repair and 
functioned as well as facilities in France. He commended the 
competence and motivation of experts operating the power plant 
and the plant's personnel training centre. 
  Prime Minister Lyuben Berov today received the Electricite 
de 
France officials. Jean Pierre Barret, director of the 
Electricite de France Nuclear Safety Programme for Eastern 
Europe, said Bulgaria commanded their confidence and would be 
their first partner in the Balkans. The sides over the next 
couple of months will explore opportunities to expand 
cooperation and work out a long-term interaction programme.

<F P=106> [Report by Tanya Tsekova] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, January 12 (BTA) -- Bulgarian President 
Zhelyu Zhelev and the floor leader of the Union of Democratic 
Forces (SDS) Mr. Stefan Savov held a tete-a-tete discussion 
which lasted for two hours and a half today. The two met at the 
invitation of Dr. Zhelev more than two years after their last 
meeting. During that time the president maintained his contacts 
with the other parliamentary groups. After he was elected 
president as a SDS nominee, the stands of Dr. Zhelev and the SDS 
tended to diverge. 
  "We made a deep and comprehensive analysis of the domestic 
and external political situation. As far as foreign policy is 
concerned, there are no differences between the president and 
myself, as for home policy issues, we agreed on one thing: The 
reform should go on," Stefan Savov told journalists after the 
meeting. 
  The two also dwelled on the scandal which the press recently 
fanned up in relation to an issued but unpublished presidential 
decree which, according to the two major political forces, the 
Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) and the SDS, provided for 
creating structures parallel to those of the army. "According 
to President Zhelev, the establishment of a military office is a 
matter of collecting and processing information and it (the 
office) will have no operational functions," Mr. Savov said. He 
declined to make further comments and went on to say that he had 
received the decree from the president and the SDS parliamentary 
group will come out with an official stand after carefully 
considering it. Meetings of the SDS and BSP leaderships held 
yesterday decided to ask Dr. Zhelev expound the matter. 
  Mr. Savov said that President Zhelev has brought forward the 
question of restoring the old parliamentary majority of the SDS 
and the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS), 
but the two failed to reach a common understanding, as the SDS 
remained firm on their stand that they would never collaborate 
with those who had betrayed them. The SDS-DPS majority fell 
apart in late 1992, following a dissent on the formation of a 
joint cabinet. Then the incumbent non-partisan cabinet was 
formed on the mandate of the DPS after Prof. Berov was elected 
by a majority of the DPS and BSP votes. 
  The opinions of Dr. Zhelev and Mr. Savov diverged on yet 
another issue -- whether parliament should be dissolved in case 
of formation of a caretaker cabinet and early general elections, 
Mr. Savov also said. This will leave a period of some two or 
three months without a sitting parliament. While the president 
was supportive of the idea, the SDS believe that Bulgaria is a 
parliamentary republic and should never be left without 
parliament. This stand enjoys the support of the BSP as well. 
  There was full agreement between the president and myself as 
to foreign policy, Mr. Savov said. The two discussed 
possibilities for NATO-Bulgarian cooperation and the events in 
Russia. 
  We failed to agree on most issues, but I think that the 
meeting was useful and I am satisfied as a whole, Mr. Savov 
concluded.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 13 (CTK) -- Czech President Vaclav 
Havel and Premier Vaclav Klaus, at a cabinet meeting today, gave 
a broad report on U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit in Prague, 
during which Clinton held talks with Visegrad Group leaders (the 
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland), among other things, 
about their countries' attitude toward the North Atlantic 
Alliance. 
  "The cabinet listened to the reports with satisfaction and 
expressed... gratitude," Klaus told journalists, adding that the 
issue had been also discussed at the session in a matter-of-fact 
manner. 
  Asked about a meeting of the presidents of the Czech 
Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Germany, Poland, and Austria 
reported yesterday to be planned for on April 14-15 in the east 
Bohemian city of Litomysl, Havel said "such a meeting was under 
preparation and would be held as an unofficial one on the 
occasion of some cultural event." However, Havel said that for 
the time being nobody was capable of saying anything specific 
about the planned meeting. 
  The meeting was preliminarily planned during a similar 
meeting in July in Salzburg, where Czech, German, Austrian, and 
Hungarian Presidents Vaclav Havel, Thomas Klestil, Richard von 
Weizsaecker, and Arpad Goncz met on the occasion of the Salzburg 
musical festival.

Clinton's visit brought some extra confidence into Central 
Europe, Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec told journalists today. 
  The Prague meeting also helped disperse the unease 
previously 
felt in the neighboring countries, Zieleniec said, adding that 
the Partnership for Peace project holds an extreme importance 
for the building of Europe and hopefully will have a substantial 
political dimension.

  [Excerpt] Prague, Jan 13 (CTK) -- All Czech papers today 
highlight the visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton to Prague and 
the talks of the Visegrad Four. 
  In the independent daily LIDOVE NOVINY Adam Cerny comments 
on 
Clinton's meeting with the presidents of the Czech Republic, 
Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia, saying that "it is a subtle game, 
in which a most significant question is asked: whether or not a 
new curtain will be put up in Europe and where if the answer is 
in the affirmative. NATO is most cautious to avoid anything 
that could be interpreted so that it is the Alliance which 
erects and rings it down." 
  In the independent MLADA FRONTA DNES Viliam Buchert writes 
that one possible interpretation of the problem of NATO 
membership can be as follows: "After it lost its enemy from 
`the empire of the evil,' the Alliance is changing substantially 
and striving to cooperate with Russia rather than to contain it. 
With regard to Moscow's nuclear potential this is 
understandable. The countries of Central and Eastern Europe do 
not often share this view and are thus backing the old NATO. He 
who will be quicker to comprehend this will have more chances to 
see his wishes met more quickly. NATO just as its Partnership 
for Peace is only for partners, not for competitors and rivals," 
Buchert writes. 
  The farmers' daily ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY says that Clinton's 
visit has been the most complex venture of Czech diplomacy thus 
far. "The importance of the visit resides in the fact that it 
practically ruled out any further speculation about the attitude 
of the United States and NATO to Central Europe with reference 
to this or another separate negotiation, opinion or 
interpretation.... But now the ball is on Visegrad's side of 
the playground after all." 
  In the right-orientated daily CESKY DENIK Josef Landergott 
says that "only the Moscow talks of the president will be 
interesting for the superpower, America. Seen from this point 
of view his Prague stay is but a visit to the `U Tygra' pub." 
  The trade union daily PRACE says that "Bill Clinton's stay 
of 
24 hours in Prague has revealed that overseas we are still 
considered a suspected jungle," which is at variance with "the 
endlessly repeated words that for the West we are the best of 
all post-communist countries in all aspects." 
  "But if this were so, it is good that Clinton did not visit 
a 
capital situated more eastwards," the paper writes and adds that 
there the security services' agents "would probably take off the 
domestic journalists' slips." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prague, Jan 13 (CTK) -- It is irresponsible and 
unqualified to describe the Partnership for Peace as merely 
"better than nothing," since the project makes possible very 
extensive cooperation and was not conceived as a static process, 
Czech Defense Minister Antonin Baudys told journalists today. 
  Speaking at a press conference of the government coalition 
Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party 
(KDU-CSL), which he belongs to, Baudys stressed that the project 
had been drafted as a dynamic one, which would make possible 
adaptation between NATO and the countries interested in joining 
NATO, "...with the possibility of greatly accelerating the 
process if necessary," Baudys said. 
  At the same time, it is necessary to open up the Czech 
Republic's defense budget, which would be subject to civil and 
democratic oversight, and to prepare certain military units for 
possible joint operations, Baudys stated. 
  He said that the project was of a markedly individual 
character and did not count on the creation of regional defense 
associations or groups. "Of course, certain regional 
cooperation is counted on in the areas where it is needed," 
Baudys added. 
  He appreciated the fact that at the Prague talks on the 
partnership program, U.S. President Bill Clinton had underlined 
not only military cooperation, but also economic cooperation as 
cornerstones of the project. 
  The chairwoman of the opposition Left Bloc party (LB) Marie 
Stiborova said at her party's press conference today that 
Partnership for Peace did not solve the question of European 
security and de facto confirmed the strategic geopolitical 
security vacuum. 
  The project is in line with the LB opinion that it is 
necessary to seek new solutions which correspond to the dramatic 
and dynamic development of security relations in Central and 
Eastern Europe. "A simple expansion of NATO cannot bring 
positive solutions," Stiborova said. She added that worn-out 
models, including NATO, presented no way of achieving European 
security. 
  That is why the LB opposes the Czech Republic's joining any 
military pact which would be aimed against the remaining part of 
Europe, Stiborova emphasized. The LB favors the creation of new 
mechanisms of European security to be based on the principle of 
collective security and excluding any possibility of one 
European country's action against another, she said.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 11 (CTK) -- "Some prominent Czech 
Government leaders believe that the Czech Republic will join 
international structures by its own efforts and more quickly 
than the other (post-communist) countries as it is more 
advanced," former Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier 
says in today's left-leaning daily RUDE PRAVO. 
  "Though we are advanced in some respects..., these 
considerations are outdated," he says. "The potential economic 
success of the Czech Republic itself... would not guarantee our 
place in Europe and its security structures. There will be 
interest in our country only if we are full-fledged partners 
regarding responsibility towards Europe, i.e. how we work for 
the stabilization of the Central European region and for 
strengthening and expanding democracy eastward." 
  Dienstbier says that "Americans, NATO, the European 
Community 
... have many times indicated this. The Visegrad Group -- the 
Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia -- is no invention 
of the West... It is the interest of the West in guaranteed 
Central European security, which is identical with our 
interest," he says. 
  "Conditions in Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary are comparable 
with ours. These countries have identical integration goals and 
very similar interests," Dienstbier says. In this context, he 
describes the Czech Government's attitude as "arrogant and 
mistaken. Do we really not need allies and friends?" he asks. 
  Of the "Partnership for Peace" program, Dienstbier says that 
it is an "expression of NATO's unpreparedness for a liberal 
transformation. However, NATO is well aware of the fact that it 
cannot stay in its current form. Now it is up to us what we do 
about the program. We must not allow it to become a palliative 
or a 'waiting room' used by the West while it waits to see what 
happens in Russia," Dienstbier says. 
  "The project (partnership) has advantages with which it 
stands up to certain realistic criticism," he stresses and adds 
that "it provides equal changes for all. None of the countries 
can speak about discrimination or a new curtain falling. It is 
up to each individual state when it creates the necessary 
political, economic, and military prerequisites for its 
integration (into international structures)," the former federal 
foreign minister says. 
  "Nor is it possible to isolate Russia or the Ukraine. Their 
incorporation into the democratic world is of key importance for 
European security," he stresses, adding that "on the other hand, 
however, it is impossible to give in to remnants of imperial 
thinking." 
  Dienstbier believes that the shortest and easiest way of 
joining NATO requires the Czech Republic's political and 
economic stability, "our readiness to defend ourselves and be 
partners in the joint defense of the democratic world. Finally, 
we must prove that we are capable of being an active stabilizing 
factor in Central Europe," Dienstbier says.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 13 (CTK) -- The main goal of U.S. 
President Bill Clinton's visit in Europe is to enhance the 
United States military and economic penetration into East Europe 
and to build a "foothold" against Russia, Communist Party of 
Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM) Chairman Miroslav Grebenicek told 
journalists today. 
  He recalled Clinton's idea, voiced during his visit in 
Europe, that solving economic and social problems and ensuring 
prosperity for all was one of the prerequisites for the peace 
and security of states. Grebenicek said it was necessary that 
this idea not to remain a mere oratorial [as received] phrase 
but be implemented in specific deeds. 
  He said American initiatives designed to help reforms in 
Central and East European countries were not meeting this task. 
He said the United States had allocated $400 million to support 
democratic and market reforms in these countries, which amounts 
to 13 percent of the U.S annual military aid to Israel. 
  The Partnership for Peace plan would be an "unequal 
partnership" for Central European countries and would deepen the 
rivalry among the Visegrad Four countries (the Czech Republic, 
Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland), Grebenicek said. "We are 
anxious that the Czech political leadership has enthusiastically 
agreed with it.... A referendum should decide on its 
acceptance," he added. 
  Vojtech Folip, a KSCM expert on legislation and human 
rights, 
said that the agreement crossed the bounds of the Constitution 
by, for example, the fact that it would station foreign armies 
on the Czech Republic's territory which, he said, would be 
limitation of its state sovereignty. 
  The Communists hold the view that cooperation in Europe 
could 
be much better secured through the revival of the Helsinki 
process than through the expansion of NATO, KSCM Deputy Chairman 
Miloslav Randsdorf said. He pointed to the fact that the Czech 
Republic would have to "financially participate in North 
Atlantic Alliance actions." At a time of economic reform this 
would be an especially sensitive burden for the state budget, he 
said. 
  The Communists favor a Europe stretching from the Atlantic 
to 
the Urals without a privileged position for anyone and the flow 
of such foreign capital in the Czech Republic which would 
enhance the economic strength of the country. 
  Grebenicek said that unlike German capital, which could 
threaten the Czech national identity, the penetration of 
American capital does not represent such a danger.

  [Excerpt] Prague, Jan 12 (CTK) -- Today's Czech dailies 
report on the arrival of U.S. President Bill Clinton in Prague, 
on NATO's acceptance of the American Partnership for Peace 
initiative and on tomorrow's meetings between Clinton and the 
heads of the Visegrad Group states (Czech Republic, Slovakia, 
Hungary, and Poland). 
  The independent daily MLADA FRONTA DNES carries a commentary 
on the NATO summit, which ended in Brussels today, writing that 
it "changed the security situation of the Czech Republic more 
than many citizens and politicians will admit." 
  The Prague government has already accepted the conditions of 
military cooperation contained in the Partnership for Peace 
initiative, the paper writes. "Now Czech military and security 
experts must prove what they can do and how they can contribute 
to the community of interests of at least 38 countries of Europe 
and North America." Over the next five years, the paper writes, 
the Czech Republic must learn to live and cooperate with NATO 
and its other partners. 
  The paper also points out the obligations the Czech Republic 
will take on in joining the Partnership for Peace. "Not only 
joint maneuvers, exercises, and financing of the future 
participation of the partners in international joint units for 
special missions will be planned, but before long also their 
engagement. And this already concerns the lives of our soldiers 
in fulfilling peace missions in crisis areas of Eastern Europe 
under the auspices of the U.N. or the European Union," the paper 
writes. 
  CESKY DENIK also comments on the Partnership for Peace, 
which 
should bring the countries of the Visegrad Group closer to NATO. 
"The American Partnership for Peace plan came at the very moment 
it became clear that the European allies of the United States 
were not capable of taking any coordinated steps in Eastern 
Europe," the paper writes. The Partnership for Peace is the 
most that the Central European countries can obtain from today's 
political situation, and is a fundamental breakthrough in the 
surviving hegemony of Russian generals over the Central European 
regions, writes CESKY DENIK. 
  The independent daily LIDOVE NOVINY turns its attention to 
the same topic, writing: "NATO is extending a helping hand -- 
but only in such a way that the outreached hand will not be 
grasped too tightly. As with the Balkans, it does not want to 
allow the possibility that it could be drawn into such a 
conflict." The paper notes that even the Czech Republic is 
acting with circumspection and that "it may be expected that the 
two careful betrothed ones will wait quite a while for the 
fruits of their love." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prague, Jan 12 (CTK) -- The Economics Ministry has 
dissolved the working group in charge of organizing the 
repatriation of ethnic Czechs from the Ukrainian region of 
Volhynia who were hit by radioactivity following the 1986 
accident at a reactor of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. The 
operation will not continue any longer, Ruzena Misonova, a 
member of the working group, told CTK today. 
  Misonova said that the operation, which had been first 
initiated by the Czechoslovak Government and later continued by 
the Czech one, enabled 1,812 Volhynian Czechs to move to the 
Czech Republic, of whom 889 were repatriated in 1991, 505 in 
1992, and 418 in 1993. 
  Three hundred applications for repatriation remain to be 
settled. As no law exists on conditions of repatriation of 
ethnic Czechs living abroad, these and other possible applicants 
will be treated in the same way as any foreigners who ask for 
permission to stay permanently in the Czech Republic and for 
Czech citizenship, Misonova explained. 
  The Association of Volhynian Czechs and Their Friends 
insists 
that at least one official from the Interior Ministry should be 
charged to settle the problems of Czechs from Volhynia. Vaclav 
Landa, the association's representative in charge of the 
repatriation, told CTK that the association was likely to ask 
the Economics Ministry to solve the present situation. 
  Volhynia is a historical region situated in Ukraine where 
many Czechs moved in the course of the 19th century, creating a 
significant, economically, and culturally active ethnic 
minority. Their total before World War Two was about 40,000. 
  In 1946-47, a large number of Volhynian Czechs were 
repatriated under an inter-governmental agreement.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 12 (CTK) -- The trade unions cannot 
allow any restriction of either the establishment of trade union 
organizations within the state administration or membership in 
these organizations, Vladimir Petrus, chairman of the Czech and 
Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions (CMKOS), says in a statement 
given to CTK today. 
  Convention No. 87 of the International Labor Organization 
(ILO) "On Trade Unions' Freedom and Protection of the Right to 
Assemble" must be respected even in relation to civil servants, 
Petrus stresses. He quotes the agreement as saying that both 
employees and employers have the right to establish 
organizations according to their own choice, without previous 
approval, and to become members of these organizations. 
  Czechoslovakia ratified the convention in 1964, and the 
document is binding the Czech Republic as well, Petrus states. 
  He admits certain restrictions, mainly as regards the right 
to strike and collective bargaining, which can be replaced by 
another kind of negotiating working conditions. These partial 
restrictions can be applied in relation to civil servants and 
organizations providing for fundamental services, Petrus says. 
  "It is impossible either to replace trade unions with any 
loyal association of interest or push for senior officials' 
associating in their own, exclusive and loyal trade union 
organizations," Petrus says. 
  At its meeting on Monday, the CMKOS board discussed a draft 
General Agreement for 1994 and decided not to sign it in its 
present form. One of the reasons for the decision was the 
board's opposition to the removal of trade unions from the state 
administration, as proposed by the government. 
  The agreement aimed to maintain social peace is concluded 
annually by the government, trade unions, and employers.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 13 (CTK) -- Jaromir Stetina, former 
editor-in-chief of the independent daily LIDOVE NOVINY, 
expressed concern about the future independence of the paper 
today. Stetina, who resigned on Wednesday [12 January], told 
CTK that he believed that most of the staff shared his fear, 
being shocked by the latest developments in the paper. "I never 
knew that it was so easy to violate documents in force," he said. 
  LIDOVE NOVINY was founded in 1893 as a liberal daily. Banned 
by the communist regime after it seized power, it started 
reappearing in 1988 as a dissident publication. 
  Last November the Swiss press company Ringier purchased a 
majority stake in the paper, whose circulation is around 100,000 
copies. 
  Stetina justified his resignation by the fact that the new 
internal rules and procedures, accepted by the Board of 
Directors of the LIDOVE NOVINY joint stock company recently, 
violates two essential documents -- the Editorial Statute and 
the agreement on the editor-in-chief -- which guarantee the 
independence of the paper. 
  "The internal rules and procedures circumvent the editor's 
right to appoint leading workers of the staff.... As long as 
they are in force it will be quite easy to replace one-third of 
the leading workers who give their judgment on a new 
editor-in-chief," Stetina said. 
  The Board of Directors said on Wednesday that it "did not 
see 
any discrepancy between the internal rules and the status of the 
staff."

  [Text] Budapest, 13 January (MTI) -- Defense officials 
have been working on plans for joining NATO's peace-partnership 
process since October, Hungarian Defense Policymaker Csaba Kiss 
said on Thursday [13 January]. Defense planning and spending 
need to be more open and in line with NATO standards, and under 
stronger civilian control. Defense Ministry and Army Command 
links, cut in 1989, need to be repaired. 
  In future, Hungarian soldiers will participate in 
peace-keeping operations not just as observers, and there will 
be independent subunits for humanitarian assistance and tackling 
disasters. Various subunits will be picked to cooperate with 
NATO troops. Small-scale joint exercises are expected in the 
second half of this year. 
  Hungary's air defense and airspace observation should also 
be 
converted to NATO formats, airplanes being fitted with 
friend-or-foe identification systems and ground radars 
overhauled so as to be able to communicate with NATO planes. 
  Two Hungarian military planners will soon go to NATO's 
Brussels headquarters. Kiss hopes the Ministry can cover extra 
costs from involvement in the new NATO program out of budget 
reserves.

  [Text] Budapest, 14 Jan (MTI) -- Hungary's Government on 
Thursday decided to merge the Defence Ministry and the Army 
Command, restoring the order before 1989, Government Spokeswoman 
Judit Juhasz announced on Friday morning. The briefing was 
attended by Defence Minister Lajos Fur, Parliamentary State 
Secretary for Defence Rudolf Joo and Army Commander 
Colonel-General Kalman Lorincz. 
  They cited the new defence legislation as the main reason 
for 
the measure. The law, passed by almost unanimous parliament 
support, rules that the defence minister is the superior of the 
army commander, and that the armed forces are under permanent 
civilian control both in peacetime and at war. The merger 
incurs no extra costs for the Defence Ministry, and might even 
bring some savings, Fur said in reply to a question. 
  The minister confirmed that senior officers who have 
completed their 55th year will be retired. Lorincz will be one 
of them this year. Two generals might be retired in the the 
first half and four in the second half of the year. Lorincz 
said he will turn 55 in February, and he is prepared to retire 
as he fulfilled the army reorganization tasks assigned to him in 
1989.

  [Text] Budapest, 11 Jan (MTI) -- "The transformation of 
television and radio into machines of propaganda and the 
creation of an information monopoly harming the purity of 
general elections have continued since the government of Boross 
took office," says a communique issued by the executive of the 
opposition Alliance of Free Democrats (AFD) Tuesday night. 
  According to the communique, the possibility has been 
eliminated to get truthful information and objective analysis of 
public affairs and policies of opposition parties from radio and 
television. To support the statement, the communique mentions 
the elimination of discussion programmes and their turning into 
monologues. In the AFD's view, another step towards political 
monopoly is the dismissal of all those who insist on giving 
objective information to the public. 
  The communique says that, according to press reports, 
government forces are holding talks with a part of the 
opposition about appointments at the helm of radio and 
television. The AFD does not take part in any such talks. The 
Free Democrats are ready to participate in consultations about 
the media law but, at these talks, they seek to examine whether 
the government is willing to guarantee objective and many-sided 
information, the communique says.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 13 -- Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej 
Olechowski told a press conference Thursday that "Poland is more 
secure today than yesterday" and a "step closer to NATO." He 
expressed such an opinion after the Visegrad Group summit 
attended by President Bill Clinton on Wednesday. 
  Olechowski said that the "Partnership for Peace" had a 
significant influence on European security and stressed that 
only democratic countries could take part in this process. 
  The "Partnership for Peace" initiative consolidates the 
possibilities of preserving and restoring peace at the time of 
crisis and also gives Poland an access to NATO technologies and 
information, as well as to Western early warning systems. 
  The foreign minister also recalled that Poland signed 
treaties with all the neighbouring countries apart from 
Lithuania but he stressed that negotiations on the 
Polish-Lithuanian treaty were under way and are expected to be 
concluded at the end of January.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 14/1/1994 -- Referring to the 
news item released by AFP and published by Turkish dailies 
regarding a statement by Albert Chernyshev, Russian ambassador 
to Turkey, who accuses Romania of sucking in, without 
authorization, a part of the Russian natural gas meant for 
Turkey, the Romanian Ministry of Industries issued the following 
press release to the ROMPRES national agency: 
  "Romania's taking in a part of the Russian natural gas meant 
for Turkey is a technical impossibility. The natural gas supply 
from the Russian Federation to the Balkan countries, i.e. 
Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey runs through separate pipelines. 
The pipelines for Turkey and Bulgaria are connected to the 
pumping station at Orlovska, on Ukraine's territory. There is 
no outlet or other possibility to draw gas from these pipelines 
all along their length that traverses Romania. 
  "The pipeline that supplies Romania has the junction in 
Ukraine, upstream the Orlovska compressing station, i.e. on that 
station's intake. 
  "Besides, a representative of Gazprom -- the Russian natural 
gas exporter -- is permanently monitoring the gas amounts 
supplied to the three countries at the Isaccea station where the 
pipelines enter Romania's territory."

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 12/1/1994 -- Referring to the 
steps taken by the county council chairmen of Satu Mare and 
Maramures Counties for adhesion to the Euro-Carpathian Region 
and to Ukraine's initiative to include the Romanian counties of 
Botosani and Suceava in the same organization, Romanian Foreign 
Ministry Spokesman Mircea Geoana emphasized the following things 
at the news briefing of January 12: 
  "In the first case, the issue has two aspects: A legal and a 
political one. As concerns the legal aspect, the things are 
clear: The two chairmen of county councils were not empowered to 
sign a possible adhesion. As for the political aspect 
concerning the future of Europe, the enhancement of integration 
and stability on the continent and in our region, this kind of 
cooperation at the level of localities or territorial 
administrative units is a viable formula. The problem consists 
only of the manner of delimitation of the area in which this 
organization is functioning. We want to be sure that such steps 
do not conceal also things contrary to the European 
organizations' generous and noble purpose of securing the 
states' cooperation and prosperity. Ukraine's efforts to 
include in the Euro-Carpathian Region two counties of Romania -- 
Botosani and Suceava --, where the numbers of the Ukrainian 
minority are rather inconsequential, means a stand taken by the 
Ukrainian Government precisely on this preoccupation of ours. 
The possibility of Romania's participation in the 
Euro-Carpathian Region or in other forms of similar cooperation 
has been under the foreign ministry's consideration," spokesman 
Mircea Geoana said.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 13 (CTK) -- Slovak Premier Vladimir 
Meciar said today he considered the Czech Republic's individual 
efforts to gain membership in the North Atlantic Alliance as 
soon as possible "a natural element of the interests of each 
country." "If the Czech Republic succeeds in gaining it (the 
membership) earlier, it would in no respect threaten us, on the 
contrary," Meciar told journalists. 
  At the same time he stressed that Bratislava would seek 
coordination of actions and support mutual assistance among the 
remaining Visegrad Group states (Slovakia, the Czech Republic, 
Hungary, Poland) so that all the countries are admitted to NATO. 
  The Czech Republic's interest in integration (with the West) 
-- if integration in the Central European region fails -- should 
not be considered straying away from the Visegrad Four. "That 
some are falling behind is not the reason for all to fall 
behind. [words indistinct] with Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus as

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 13 (CTK) -- The opposition 
Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) does not consider 
Partnership for Peace a solution because it does not create any 
security guarantees for the Visegrad Four countries, KDH Deputy 
Chairman Frantisek Miklosko told CTK today. 
  Only if the project were joined by Russia, some security 
zone 
could be envisaged, Miklosko said. If, however, the situation 
in Russia radicalizes through an increase in Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy's power, the joint security project would be just a 
formality again, Miklosko stated. 
  The fact that British Prime Minister John Major and German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl failed to mention Slovakia among 
candidates for NATO membership was not accidental, Miklosko 
said, adding that conflicts with ethnic Hungarians, political 
instability, some statements by politicians, in particular by 
Premier Vladimir Meciar, and Slovakia's endangered democracy are 
the reasons for this. 
  The opposition Alliance of Slovak Democrats (AD SR), 
however, 
assesses the Prague meeting of the Visegrad Four with Clinton 
positively, AD SR Chairman Milan Knazko told journalists today. 
  He said that he did not conceive Partnership for Peace as a 
final solution, but as a great opportunity for the future, since 
cooperation by the Visegrad countries could speed up their 
admission into NATO. 
  Knazko also said that statements such as that by Transport 
Minister Roman Hofbauer, published in the pro-Meciar daily 
REPUBLIKA, "the Czech Republic is changing, whether it wants to 
or not, from the European heart into the final part of the 
European digestive tract," do not help improve Czech-Slovak 
relations. Knazko noted that the AD SR would support the effort 
by the KDH to dismiss Hofbauer.

  [Excerpts] Bratislava, jan 12 (CTK) -- [passage omitted] 
  It is becoming a rule that the West, when talking about the 
Visegrad Four (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland) or 
NATO fails to mention Slovakia. It is a rule that our diplomacy 
does not take it into consideration as a warning signal but 
rather as an expression of human absentmindedness, the 
left-leaning daily PRAVDA writes today. 
  The author points to the television station CNN, whose 
interview with V-4 representatives omitted Slovakia, to the 
general surprise. The U.S. daily TODAY, examining the views of 
American citizens on the expansion of NATO, even mentions 
Albania while again forgetting Slovakia, the daily adds. 
  The culmination comes with statements by German Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl and British Premier John Major who, speaking about 
the Visegrad Four countries, again omit Slovakia. The author of 
the commentary adds that everything has been explained in the 
long run -- the Western politicians have mentioned only 
countries who have made biggest progress in economies. 
  Concluding the article, the daily voices hope that Slovak 
politicians will at last sober up after Prague and Brussels as 
Slovakia will not achieve recognition by shouting, but through 
political culture and economic growth. 
  The independent NARODNA OBRODA turns its attention to the 
Brussels NATO summit assessing it as the continuation of the 
West's strategy of "not burning its fingers unnecessarily." 
  Partnership for Peace theoretically gives each state the 
hope 
of becoming a member of the North Atlantic Alliance by a date 
which has not been precisely defined, which means that it 
provides them with equal chances, the daily writes. 
  Moscow is highly satisfied with such a solution as 
theoretically it gives it an opportunity to join NATO and 
because Partnership for Peace does not much differ from Moscow's 
preferences of creating European security structures together 
with abiding with bilateral treaties, the daily writes. 
  "However, the Brussels summit and the preparation of U.S. 
President Bill Clinton's Prague meeting with the Visegrad Four 
presidents showed that in reality there exists the possibility 
of a "two-gear solution" (the incorporation of individual states 
in NATO), the daily stresses. 
  It notes that "Prague has definitively buried the 
possibility 
of a coordinated course in political and security questions and 
that prospects for economic cooperation are growing ever vaguer. 
  "Naturally all this was bound to provoke the displeasure -- 
to a greater or lesser extent expressed aloud -- of other 
members of Visegrad Four which is currently merely a 
pseudo-group. Czech President Vaclav Havel and Premier Vaclav 
Klaus have made it unambiguously clear that self-seeking 
preference of Czech interests was their primary goal. They do 
not want take into account the fact that the Czech Republic is 
part of a certain region whose developments will influence the 
development of the whole European area, the paper writes. 
[passage omitted] 
  NARODNA OBRODA writes that the fact that British Premier 
John 
Major and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Brussels again 
omitted Slovakia in their speeches on Visegrad was an almost 
sinister signal as far as Slovak membership of NATO is concerned. 
  "This only confirmed the wide-spread view that the Slovak 
Republic, in the year of its independent existence, did not 
prove itself sufficiently as regards the transformation of its 
economy and stabilizing the internal political situation, 
including solution of ethnic minority problems.... Instead of 
this we are witnessing constant political floundering and the 
fight for a mere survival on the political scene," the daily 
writes. "People who might think that the world around does not 
register this are committing the worst injustice against the 
citizens of this country," the paper writes, warning against 
underestimation of a "very serious signal from Brussels."

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 13 (CTK) -- Both Hungarian and 
Slovak premiers consider the so far attitudes to controversial 
problems of Slovak-Hungarian relations, including ethnic 
minorities and the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros water works on the 
Danube, to be irrational and damaging, Slovak Premier Vladimir 
Meciar said today. He said that he had agreed on this with his 
Hungarian counterpart, Peter Boross, at their meeting on 
Wednesday [12 January] in Prague. 
  Slovakia and Hungary should not impair each other in the 
present situation, Meciar said. Slovakia is willing to conclude 
a "major (interstate) treaty," to negotiate the creation of a 
customs union and the opening of several new border crossings, 
Meciar stated, stressing that essential decisions could be 
expected only after the forthcoming Hungarian parliamentary 
elections. 
  In accepting the Partnership for Peace project, the 
countries 
involved have also committed themselves to maintain democracy, 
observe human and minority rights, and honor current state 
borders, Meciar said. 
  Under documents it has adopted, Slovakia will guarantee its 
Hungarian minority the international standard of human rights, 
but will not tolerate any more pressure, Meciar emphasized. It 
is necessary to stop efforts to create autonomous bodies, change 
the political situation in some regions' administration, push 
for autonomy aimed at the spheres of finances and security, and 
"to prevent developments from escalating further," Meciar stated.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 12 (CTK) -- A disagreement with the 
unilateral decision by Hungary regarding demolition of the 
circle dam at Nagymaros-Gabcikovo water work was expressed by 
Ivo Hlavacek, a Slovak Foreign Ministry official, Slovak 
Television announced today. 
  Today's verbal protest lodged with Ferenc Boros, charge 
d'affaires of Hungarian Embassy, states that Hungary's 
unilateral decision (of January 31, 1993) violated the 1977 
agreement and that Slovakia would lodge a complaint at the 
International Court of Justice in The Hague for all damages 
caused by the "illegal action."

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 11 (CTK) -- Slovakia's Foreign 
Ministry said today it was concerned about the "unobjective 
information" on the meeting of Hungarian elected representatives 
in Komarno, south Slovakia, on January 8, spread by the 
Hungarian Government Office for Hungarian Ethnic Minorities 
Abroad. The ministry handed the protest to the charge 
d'affaires of the Hungarian Embassy in Slovakia, Ferenc Boros. 
  The protest says that the information, destined for foreign 
diplomatic missions, is provided "out of context" and is 
"unobjective and misleading." Providing false information on 
developments in Slovakia by Hungarian authorities does not serve 
good neighborly relations, the protest says. 
  It warns that misleading information on the ongoing process 
of the territorial administrative arrangement of Slovakia could 
assume the character of interference in Slovakia's internal 
affairs.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 13 (CTK) -- In 1991 a total of 
1,334,434 people lived on the territory of southern Slovakia, 
excepting Bratislava, Kosice, and the Nitra district, with 
771,196 Slovaks (57.9 percent) and 517,936 ethnic Hungarians 
(38.8 percent), the daily REPUBLIKA writes today. 
  Statistics "experts" from the ranks of participants in the 
January 8 Komarno meeting maintain that according to the 1991 
census, 824,946 people, including 507,073 Hungarians, live in 
the ethnically mixed southern Slovak region spreading from 
Bratislava to south Zemplin, with Slovaks and other ethnic 
minorities (Romanies and Czechs) comprising the rest. These 
data are not correct, says the daily, organ of the state-owned 
Slovak News Agency (TA SR). 
  Other data concerning an ethnic Hungarian area south of 
Nitra, where ethnic Hungarians allegedly are in the majority in 
18 villages of the district, are false, the daily asserts. 
According to the 1991 census, Hungarians make up a majority 
only in 10 villages of the district. Ethnic Hungarians make up 
the majority in southern Slovakia only in the Dunajska Streda 
and Komarno districts. In other districts, Slovaks make up the 
majority and they have therefore the decisive right to speak on 
the question of the future territorial administrative 
arrangement of this region, REPUBLIKA writes. 
  Slovaks living on territories with mixed population are 
considerably harmed by the election law drafted on the principle 
of majority participation. This is witnessed, for example, by 
the situation in the Nove Zamky district where there are only 8 
Slovaks in the 45-member local representation, although Slovaks 
make up 70 percent of this district's population. 
  The reason for such a situation is a very simple. Almost all 
ethnic Hungarians voted for actually one party -- Egyutteles 
(Coexistence) while Slovaks voted for representatives of 
different parties which led to the diffusion of their votes. 
They thus failed to further the majority of their deputies in 
local representations even in towns and villages where Slovaks 
make up the majority, the daily writes.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 13 (CTK) -- "It especially annoys 
me that no Slovak is spoken in dozens of south Slovak 
settlements," Slovak Culture Minister Dusan Slobodnik told CTK 
today. 
  He was referring to the recommendation made by the Council 
of 
Europe (CE) that every citizen be obliged to master the language 
of the country he lives in. Slobodnik said he did not rule out 
that the Education Ministry would issue a decree stipulating 
that Slovak could be taught only by Slovak teachers at ethnic 
Hungarian schools. Only this would guarantee that ethnic 
Hungarians would master the Slovak language, he added. 
  Slobodnik said that Slovakia "had no reason to feel ashamed 
of its policy towards ethnic minorities. Quite the opposite." 
There is a comprehensive network of primary and secondary 
education with Hungarian as a teaching language, heavily 
subsidized by the state, Slobodnik stated. 
  The Slovaks and Hungarians living in Slovakia are absolutely 
equal, he said, pointing to the fact that last year 26 Hungarian 
periodicals of all sorts, funded by the state, were published in 
Slovakia. The state also subsidizes two Hungarian regional 
theaters and 12 publishing houses, he added. The Culture 
Ministry neither influences the repertory of the theaters, nor 
does it interfere with the published papers and books, although 
"it is often not satisfied with them," he said. 
  "The cultural autonomy of the ethnic Hungarians actually 
exists, although some people do not want to admit it," Slobodnik 
stated. 
  Slovakia has assumed a model approach towards ethnic 
minorities, not only with respect to culture, Slobodnik claimed. 
Many ethnic Hungarians bear this in mind, and do not associate 
themselves with the demands of their so-called political 
representatives for a province. "They keep in mind that their 
economic position in Slovakia is more advantageous than would be 
possible in Hungary," Slobodnik stated.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 13 (CTK) -- Within the Partnership 
for Peace, Slovakia has offered NATO the capacities of its arms 
industry and cooperation in developing military equipment, 
Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar told journalists today. 
  Speaking at a press conference after top Visegrad Four (the 
Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia) representatives 
met with U.S. President Bill Clinton on Wednesday in Prague, 
Meciar said that Slovak arms production could not compete with 
that of NATO's, given, among other things, the existence of two 
military systems in the past. 
  Slovak heavy weaponry is of good mechanical quality, while 
its electronic systems are improving, Meciar stated. 
  Slovakia's arms production dropped in 1993 to 8 to 9 percent 
of its 1989 level. This is a huge decline, which cannot be 
called conversion to peaceful purposes. The conversion should 
represent a change of 5 percent a year, Meciar stressed. 
  The present situation in the Slovak arms industry is due to 
bad decisions by the former Czechoslovak Federal Government, 
which halted the final production of arms without regard to 
continuing supplies, which mostly came from the Czech Republic. 
This resulted in billion losses, Meciar said. He stressed that 
the Czech Republic was now striving to revive the production of 
military systems, which had been halted in Slovakia. 
  A joint-stock company with state participation, aimed at 
exporting Slovak arms, has been founded in Slovakia. A 
commission has also been set up to decide on each deal, Meciar 
concluded.

institution in Slovakia is the Slovak Army, according to an 
opinion poll conducted by the Slovak Statistical Bureau. 
  After omitting answers such as "I don't know," the following 
institutions were deemed most trusted by Slovaks: Army, 
president, Church, unions, Police, Parliament, courts, and 
prosecutor, and, lastly, the government. 
  The research showed a higher level of mistrust than trust in 
state bodies. Only two out of eight institutions earned more 
trust than mistrust: the Army and the president.

  [Text] Gyorgy Csoti, deputy chairman of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee, and member of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, held a 
press briefing this morning. Judit Laszlo reports: 
  [Laszlo] The Brussels summit and the Partnership for Peace 
is 
an important milestone in the process that was proclaimed by the 
government led by Jozsef Antall in 1990. The point of this was 
to do away with eastern ties and to approach western 
integration, Gyorgy Csoti said. 
  The decision on the Partnership for Peace is important from 
the point of view of the region's security. The Bundestag 
Foreign Affairs Committee is of a similar opinion. It was this 
committee that recently invited a Hungarian Foreign Affairs 
Committee delegation to visit Germany. Returning form there, 
Gyorgy Csoti said the central and eastern European countries, or 
rather everybody, even Kazakhstan, has to offer a kind of 
partnership to the western integration organizations, for 
example, NATO, which, on the one hand is directed toward 
membership, and on the other toward cooperation. The latter is 
all the more important, for it is not possible for everybody to 
become a NATO member, and not everybody wants to. Gyorgy Csoti 
here mentioned Russia, which is extended on two continents and 
is a match for the Western European region. 
  Csoti also said that German politicians, contrary to rumors, 
particularly supported the integration endeavors of Hungary and 
the Visegrad Group countries. Also discussed at the talks in 
Germany was Hungary soon receiving a status similar to associate 
membership in the West European Union, Csoti said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Foreign Affairs Minister Geza </F>
Jeszenszky by Grzegorz Lubczyk; place and date not given: "We 
Can Accept the Arguments of the United States"] 
  [Text] [Lubczyk] What will Hungarian foreign policy be 
like after the recent decisions at the NATO summit and the 
Prague meeting of Visegrad Group leaders and U.S. President Bill 
Clinton? 
  [Jeszenszky] It will not change. We have positively 
accepted the decisions reached in Brussels and Prague. In the 
Czech capital, we all agreed that the "Partnership for Peace" 
plan began to become much more specific. This is not the 
optimal situation for which Poland and Hungary have strived, 
however, we are able to accept the U.S. arguments, in line with 
which both Ukraine and Russia will be incorporated into the 
process of shaping security and peace in Europe. Now our main 
task will be to do as much as possible for the implementation of 
the "Partnership for Peace" program, and to do this as quickly 
as possible. 
  [Lubczyk] Is it already known what will be the order of 
measures that Hungary is going to take? 
  [Jeszenszky] Very soon we will hold important talks. We 
expect a U.S. military delegation to come to Hungary within two 
weeks. It is then that we will discuss a strategy for future 
activities. 
  [Lubczyk] Mr. Minister, President Clinton left Prague for 
Kiev and Moscow. Do you not fear any possible U.S.-Ukrainian or 
U.S.-Russian decisions that might threaten our regional 
interests? Can we believe the Americans? 
  [Jeszenszky] In the 20th century, both our countries were 
put to so many tests that it is really difficult to have any 
faith left. However, I believe that in the past the United 
States and the other NATO states proved that we should change 
our attitude toward them. The present Western leaders are doing 
a lot to prevent any doubts concerning the purity of their 
intentions and declarations. 
  I think that they treated the Polish and Hungarians warnings 
very seriously. I cannot even imagine that the United States 
would sacrifice our countries for their joint interests with 
Russia or Ukraine. In the past three or four years, we have 
been making great efforts to make the West realize that we 
cannot be left aside and that it is also in the interest of the 
West to incorporate Central Europe into Western structures. 
  [Lubczyk] Should we still use the expression of the Visegrad 
Group, after all the controversies among the states of our 
region leading up to the Prague summit? 
  [Jeszenszky] "Visegrad" does not depend exclusively on the 
words and actions of certain politicians. The Visegrad 
agreement was the result of the geographical and historical 
situation. Our countries, being in the same region of Europe, 
can in fact achieve success together, or they can experience 
failure together, either in the area of security or economics. 
Therefore, I am an optimist. I believe that the framework of 
cooperation that we have had so far will not only be maintained 
-- I believe that it will be extended and strengthened, not for 
a year or two, but for decades to come. I anticipate a 
situation similar to the Benelux countries or in Scandinavia to 
develop. I hope that our nations -- I am not referring solely 
to the Poles and Hungarians -- will also achieve the level of 
fraternity, similar to the Scandinavians, who used to wage wars 
against each other, whereas today, when we speak about those 
states, we just naturally list them all together. 
  [Lubczyk] What is the place of Poland in Hungarian foreign 
policy? 
  [Jeszenszky] I have always been of the opinion that the 
Polish-Hungarian friendship does not depend on our governments. 
Of course, tradition still forms the basis of our relations. 
However, we are linked not only by similar histories, but also 
by similar mentalities in both societies. Hungary considers 
Poland to be one of its most trusted partners, which has been 
confirmed in many areas of the international activities of both 
countries. 
  [Lubczyk] If, as you say, Poland means so much to Hungary, 
then why is it so that we feel that more could be done in the 
area of nonpolitical cooperation? Representatives of companies 
trading with Hungary claim that Poles offer their Hungarian 
partners better conditions than those offered to Poles by 
Hungarians. Do you not think that this deadlock in the area of 
economic cooperation should be broken? 
  [Jeszenszky] I could not agree with you more. I also think 
that the degree of economic cooperation, for instance, is not 
satisfactory. However, we should also bear in mind that 
nowadays not everything depends on the will of governments. 
Unfortunately, both our nations have the same weak spot: a 
degree of snobbishness and excessive admiration of the West. I 
think that this will change only when economies start to be 
governed by real markets and market laws. If foreign investors 
are operating very successfully, both in Poland and Hungary, 
then it really means something, does it not? I wish our 
entrepreneurs would draw conclusions from this. I believe that 
the agreement on free trade will certainly expedite this process. 
  [Lubczyk] What is the main purpose of your visit to Warsaw? 
  [Jeszenszky] It is the result of bilateral agreements; 
however, not only that. As a result of recent events, in short 
referred to as "Brussels" and "Prague," many issues need to be 
discussed jointly. Some of the initiatives that were launched 
during the session of the Central European initiative in 
Debrecin should be developed as well. The Warsaw talks will 
definitely not be a waste of time.

<F P=106> ["F.J.Gy.-K.T."-initialled interview with Hungarian </F>
President Arpad Goncz; place and date not given: "Goncz: The 
Visegrad Cooperation Cannot Be Buried"] 
  [Text] [NEPSZABADSAG] Before Prague, and now at Prague 
too, many people were burying the Visegrad cooperation. From 
the very beginning, you have been a great supporter of this 
integration initiative. How do you see all this now as 
reflected in the current summit? 
  [Goncz] I would not say that the Visegrad cooperation was 
buried in Prague, because this is the regional cooperation of 
four given countries. In my opinion, this summit gave an 
impetus to this cooperation; it will probably accelerate it, or 
at least will increase the desire for economic cooperation. At 
the same time, this summit could bring the region's stability 
closer by the emergence of a negotiating mechanism capable of 
solving the possible differences of views. Thus, the common 
work of the four definitely contributes to the stability of the 
region and plays a balancing role in Central Europe. 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] However, the Czech leaders openly say that 
they have something else in mind and, for some time, they have 
practically refrained from uttering the word Visegrad. 
  [Goncz] It makes no difference whatsoever if someone 
mentions Visegrad or not. The essential think today is that the 
forms of cooperation have emerged and, although not a security 
guarantee, the region received the possibility of a negotiating 
mechanism that has a balancing power in itself. 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] Should one fear that rivalry in Central 
Europe might even accelerate after the acceptance of the 
Partnership of Peace program? 
  [Goncz] Yes, there will obviously be criteria here, and the 
compatibility of the countries in the region for closer 
cooperation with NATO will be examined also from a military 
viewpoint. Given the fact that these conditions have not been 
formulated at this summit, and they will probably be formulated 
later, I cannot tell which country will be the first to join. 
Honestly speaking, I think this is a rather secondary issue, 
because the stability of the region itself if what matters. I 
interpret security in a much broader sense than only military 
security. Naturally, NATO is an extremely important element of 
European security, but it does not replace an all-European 
security system. The way I see it, we have now made a step 
forward in this direction, and a considerable step at that. 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] President Walesa made a particularly dramatic 
statement before the meeting. What was your impression about 
the Polish attitude in Prague? 
  [Goncz] My impression is that Lech Walesa came with the most 
colorful proposals to Prague. Naturally, it was impossible to 
debate these proposals in detail, but this can obviously be done 
at a later date. 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] Does your meeting with Michal Kovac represent 
any progress in the Hungarian-Slovak relations? 
  [Goncz] This was a really important meeting, and it was held 
in a very good atmosphere. From Michal Kovac's words, I think 
the most important is that they are trying to solve the issues 
in harmony with the ideas of the Hungarian minority, and not by 
excluding this national minority. This was not my first meeting 
with Mr Kovac; I am absolutely convinced of his good will; he 
spoke wise and well-thought words. The invitation to come to 
Budapest continues to be valid, and I hope that this visit will 
take place soon.

<F P=106> [Interview with Geza Entz, chairman of the Office for </F>
Hungarians Living Beyond the Borders, by Jozsef Szabo; place and 
date not given: "We Are Not Interfering in Slovak Internal 
Affairs"] 
  [Text] The Slovak Foreign Ministry accused the Office for 
Hungarians Living Beyond the Borders of interfering in the 
internal affairs of Slovakia and of misleadingly explaining the 
debate of the Bratislava Parliament in December 1993 in its 
statements connected with the rally held in Revkomarom over the 
weekend. State Secretary Geza Entz, chairman of the Office for 
Hungarians Living Beyond the Borders, spoke to NEPSZABADSAG 
about this new misunderstanding and the controversy over the 
parliamentary representation of the national minorities living 
in Hungary. 
  [Szabo] What did your office misinterpret? 
  [Entz] Nothing. We informed the diplomats and newsmen on 
the expected events in connection with the rally in Revkomarom 
on the basis of the Slovak press reports available to us. One 
of the articles in question was published by UJ SZO [NEW WORD] 
in Bratislava, and the Slovaks probably misunderstood this 
article, although it was an objective one. The Bratislava note 
does not mention what "misleading" explanation we provided. We 
are not interfering in internal affairs. We are talking about 
Soviet-type accusations here. Gromyko used to be a great master 
of such things, and it seems that the Slovak Foreign Ministry 
has also become a great master in this. 
  [Szabo] What is your opinion about the parliamentary 
decision that made it impossible for the national minorities in 
Hungary to come up with individual election lists? 
  [Entz] The government position was the correct one, of 
course. It is difficult to solve the representation of national 
minorities in a one-chamber parliament. Their indirect 
representation can be solved in an extraordinary way by means of 
a strong positive discrimination. The government proposal 
wanted this, but the opposition rejected it by bringing up 
constitutional arguments. It is not true that the ethnic and 
national minorities in Hungary have no representation. There 
are several parliamentary deputies who represent the interests 
of national minorities by following the program of their party. 
  [Szabo] Is this the acceptable solution? 
  [Entz] It is not sure at all that this is the way to solve 
the issue of parliamentary representation for national 
minorities living in Hungary. In this particular situation, the 
issue can also be solved properly by means of the ombudsman. 
  [Szabo] Will the Hungarians living beyond our borders suffer 
most from this decision? 
  [Entz] The situation of Hungarians living in the neighboring 
countries is totally different from the situation of minorities 
living in Hungary. There is no positive discrimination there, 
because the Hungarians living in the neighboring countries have 
political and cultural traditions and they ensured their 
parliamentary representation with the help of their voters. 
  The issue of national or ethnic communities living in a 
quantitative minority is the problem of the country in question. 
These problems cannot all be solved according to the same 
pattern. The 20th century proved this. Individual countries 
must not copy their neighbors. 
  [Szabo] Do you fear any foreign policy consequences of this 
decision? 
  [Entz] The decision will not have serious international 
consequences. Every member of the international community that 
does not represent a positive position on settling the national 
minority issue or displays a withdrawing attitude will make use 
of this. They are those who "argue" that Hungary has territorial 
demands. The position of the Hungarian Government played an 
important role in making sure that the law on national 
minorities contains the need for modifying the electoral law. 
This is not an issue closed for good. It should not be 
interpreted as a factor that hinders the positive settling of 
the minority issue in this region. 
  [Szabo] Does it seem that some political circles will try to 
use this decision against Budapest? 
  [Entz] This is why we wanted this issue settled in the form 
of a government proposal. This did not happen, and some circles 
will make use of this against us. One should not dramatize this 
fact because, if this decision had not been made, they would 
find something else. 
  [Szabo] Do you see any chance of solving the parliamentary 
representation of national minorities in Hungary in a proper way? 
  [Entz] I am sure that this issue will be solved properly, 
because the law on national minorities itself settled this issue 
from a more essential and thorough viewpoint. The new 
parliament will certainly return to this issue.

<F P=106> [Interview with Janos Ader, deputy executive chairman of the </F>
Federation of Young Democrats, by Attila Farkas; place and date 
not given: "One Should Not Dramatize Viktor Orban's Statement"] 
  [Text] [Farkas] Preparation for the elections was the 
major subject at the party conference at Sitke. From this 
viewpoint, how do you evaluate the situation of the Federation 
of Young Democrats [FIDESZ]? 
  [Ader] The preparation for the election campaign should be 
evaluated from various viewpoints. One of the essential factors 
is whether the party has the necessary infrastructure and 
personnel conditions for a successful campaign. In my opinion, 
the infrastructure and apparatus development that began in 1992 
has now come to its last phase, and this process will be 
finished by the beginning of the election campaign. 
  [Farkas] The other important factor is obviously the 
selection of candidates. To what extent is this work ready? 
  [Ader] There are two branches of political preparations, and 
in one of them, namely in nominating candidates, the preparation 
is slowly coming to an end. We will hold a national committee 
meeting on the first weekend of February, when we will approve 
the list of candidates running in individual districts and the 
territorial lists, and the meeting will also decide on the 
national list. In addition, it is also important to formulate 
the political program and the messages to the voters. Actually, 
we are talking here about the expansion of the program elements 
adopted at the FIDESZ congress in Debrecen, and formulating this 
program in a language understandable for broader strata of 
voters. 
  [Farkas] Regarding the nomination of candidates, to what 
extent did the events that took place since the meeting in 
November affect this activity? 
  [Ader] Fortunately, these events did not affect the 
nomination of candidates at all; I do not know of any candidate 
who withdrew from representing the FIDESZ at the elections 
because of those events. 
  [Farkas] However, this process must have probably caused 
problems politically.... 
  [Ader] No party, including the FIDESZ, benefits from 
personnel conflicts emerging on the eve of elections. 
Naturally, this did us no good either, but I think the FIDESZ 
has already overcome this period. The relevant debates in the 
FIDESZ ended in November 1993, and now everyone is focusing on a 
successful campaign. 
  [Farkas] The fact that the FIDESZ deputies in Gyongyos left 
the party at the end of last week seems to slightly contradict 
this.... 
  [Ader] This is a fact, but I would not attribute particular 
importance to this, because Gabor Fodor originates from Gyongyos 
and the group of people there were connected to him. I am sure 
that Gyongyos remains an isolated event, and I would be 
surprised to see similar events in other areas. 
  [Farkas] Did the possible future coalition ideas affect the 
nomination of candidates? 
  [Ader] This was not a factor in selecting candidates; the 
decisive principle is to seek persons who are trained in a 
certain professional area, are known and appreciated by the 
locals, and accept the political values and goals of the FIDESZ. 
  However, a possible coalition formation did not emerge at 
all 
because there are a lot of uncertainty factors here.... 
  [Farkas] Did Viktor Orban's recent statement and its various 
interpretation cause any disturbance in the preparation for the 
elections? 
  [Ader] This did not affect the preparations for the 
elections. Besides, I find the coalition speculations rather 
useless and a waste of time, even if I know that this becomes a 
national pastime with the approach of the elections. We must 
accept the fact that the future coalition will be determined by 
the election results and the previous programs and political 
orientations. Consequently, it is possible that a political 
constellation emerges, which no one expects. In this respect, 
our previous position continues to be valid, namely that the 
FIDESZ is ready to cooperate with every party that accepts the 
basic political values and the rules of democracy. The 
compatibility of various party programs will basically affect 
cooperation after the elections. We do not have any reason to 
change our current position. 
  [Farkas] Is Viktor Orban's temporary silence connected with 
the aforementioned statement? Are there any consequences of 
this statement in the FIDESZ? 
  [Ader] I do not think that the aforementioned statement 
should be dramatized, and it is also useless to add any 
political combinations.

  [Text] Minister of Economy Maks Tajnikar organized talks 
today on the problem regarding the seizure of electricity by the 
Croatian Electrical Power Generation Industry. Taking part in 
the talks were, among others, Energy Secretary Boris Sovic; Savo 
Trepse, duty official of the Slovene Electricity Board; and 
Ostoj Kristan, director general of the Slovene Electricity 
Board. After the meeting, Joze Skok interviewed Mr. Kristan: 
  [Begin recording] [Skok] Mr. Kristan, let us first ask the 
following question: Is neighboring Croatia, or more 
specifically, its electrical power generation industry, taking 
the electricity from our network into its system? 
  [Kristan] Well, the two systems are connected and they are 
synchronically operating [words indistinct]. After we had been 
told by the nuclear power plant that it is giving us the 
(?entire) power from the beginning of its operation after the 
repair, we have made the appropriate programs and sent them to 
our partners because it was [words indistinct] that they do not 
get energy from the (?nuclear power plant), certainly not this 
quantity. As of that time, they have been taking electricity as 
if one-half belongs to them, therefore they have not been 
respecting the (?schedule). 
  [Skok] Therefore, we can say that they have been (?taking 
the electricity) from the very beginning of the work of the 
nuclear power plant? 
  [Kristan] They are taking the electricity without 
unauthorization. We are registering this as deviation from the 
program of operation and are warning them every hour in written 
form, by a faxed message. 
  [Skok] What quantity, (?that is) for how long the Croatian 
Electrical Power Generation Industry is [words indistinct] 
unauthorized seize of electricity? 
  [Kristan] That (?deviation) amounts to (?80) megawatts, 
which is approximately one-half of the production of the nuclear 
power plant. This is no technical problem for us, but is 
certainly a commercial, expense problem. A decision should be 
made certainly [words indistinct] their reaction. We are going 
to warn them tomorrow, [words indistinct] stand, to give us back 
this electricity next week. And if [words indistinct] in 
interstate relations, the programs will be changed. And if they 
refuse to give electricity back next week, that is, if that 
deviation exceeds a bearable level we should certainly take 
measures with a view to protecting our reserves and our network

<F P=106> [Commentary by Janko Saradjen] </F>
  [Text] After Dusan Pozar, senior prosecutor in Maribor, 
has handed the material on the number of violations of Security 
Council resolutions on the part of Janez Jansa and the Defense 
Ministry -- the material collected in the investigation of the 
arms affair -- over to the Ljubljana Public Prosecutor Tomaz 
Miklavcic, some procedural processes should be explained. The 
Maribor prosecutor had to hand the case over to the Ljubljana 
prosecutor because the seat of the Defense Ministry is in 
Ljubljana. As we have learned, Tomaz Miklavcic has still not 
received the aggravating material, but when he does receive it 
he will assess whether it is ready for [word indistinct]. He 
has enough time for such an assessment, according to internal 
regulations, as he himself claims, up to six months. If he 
initiates further investigations, this period could be as long 
as four years, which applies to suspicion of an act punishable 
by up to one year in prison. 
  The public prosecutor's office is a hierarchically organized 
institution, and if the procedure lasts too long the senior 
Ljubljana prosecutor Pavle Dolenc may demand that the municipal 
prosecutor speed up the matter. In order to avoid that 
altogether, he may take over the matter himself. The republican 
public prosecutor, Anton Drobnic, may also intervene. The 
development of these events may, for some people, serve as 
another occasion to assess to what extent our state is based on 
the rule of law. 
  We do not know how quickly the Public Prosecutor's Office 
will react. On this occasion, let us recall that recently, in 
some other case, the Ljubljana public prosecutor reacted very 
quickly. 
  The question is of how the aggravating material reached the 
public before the Ljubljana public prosecutor received them. Is 
the Post Office alone to blame? We would have to have this in 
mind, for the Maribor prosecutor stated that we should certainly 
take care about the country's reputation abroad and make legal 
distinction between aid to victims of aggression and violations 
committed from gainful motives.

  [Excerpts] At its session today, the Croatian Government 
examined the implementation of the second phase of the 
stabilization program, and the situation in Croatia's energy 
network in the light of certain misunderstandings as regards 
Krsko nuclear power plant. Among other things, it also examined 
the situation in Croatia's railways. [passage omitted] 
  One of the most important points on the agenda was entitled: 
the situation in Croatia's energy network. This referred mainly 
to certain cases of incomprehension and misunderstanding between 
the Slovene and Croatian sides about the Krsko nuclear plant, 
and as regards an outstanding debt owed by the Croatian 
Electricity Board to the Krsko nuclear plant. However, this is 
only a pretext for some disagreements; the real reasons are of 
another nature. Minister of Industry Nadan Vidosevic said there 
will be no problem about paying the 40 million German mark debt. 
He added: 
  [Begin Vidosevic recording] The central issue is that we are 
demanding an interstate treaty, we want extremely clear and 
correct relations, and we are demanding the protection of 50 
percent of our property, which according to some estimates is 
around $1 billion. This is a huge sum which Croatia, acting as a 
responsible country, simply has to protect. That is the central 
issue. 
  I hold that we simply ought to protect our interests, and 
strictly abide by the standpoint that we will settle our 
financial obligations, but the Slovene side has to accept the 
drawing up of an interstate treaty; we must return to the 
framework of the 1970 agreement, according to which 19 Croats 
will go back to work [in the nuclear plant]. [end recording]

spoke about the efforts Croatia has undertaken for the release 
of POW's from Serbia's detention camps. So far 6,700 Croats 
have been released, Kostovic said, and we trust the others will 
also be freed. He added that normal constructive negotiations 
on this issue conducted with the representatives of the 
so-called Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had opened other 
possibilities of successful negotiations in the future.

  [Text] Belgrade, Jan 13 (TANJUG) -- Yasushi Akashi, 
civilian head of the UN peace-keeping force in former Yugoslavia 
said Thursday [13 January] that he was encouraged by 
Yugoslavia's positive stand towards the problems faced by the UN 
Peacekeeping Forces (UNPROFOR) in former Yugoslavia. We 
discussed bilateral issues and the Yugoslav Prime Minister 
Kontic adopted a positive stand towards the problems faced by 
UNPROFOR, the UN secretary-general's envoy told a press 
conference after his meeting with the Yugoslav prime minister in 
Belgrade. 
  Kontic on his part expressed his satisfaction that a man 
from 
Japan, country which has always led a principled policy towards 
the crisis in former Yugoslavia, had come to head the UNPROFOR. 
Akashi told Kontic that he was aware that some of the UN 
Security Council decisions had caused the suffering of the 
Yugoslav population which was all the more reason why solutions 
had to be found that would lead to their cancellation. 
  The United Nations had introduced sanctions against 
Yugoslavia in May 1992 because of its alleged involvement in the 
civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, even though Yugoslavia has no 
troops in that republic. Akashi also informed Kontic that the 
Security Council sanctions committee had simplified the 
procedure for obtaining authorisations for food and medicine 
imports and that this procedure now took only a few days instead 
of weeks or months. 
  The Japanese diplomat also said that NATO had asked UNPROFOR 
to prepare a feasibility study on carrying out air strikes on 
Serb positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina. At the beginning of this 
week, NATO had threatened the Bosnian Serbs with air strikes in 
order to stop the bombing of Sarajevo, secure the opening of 
Tuzla airport and the relief of the UN Canadian contingent in 
Srebrenica, a Moslem enclave in east Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  However, it is the Moslems who are responsible for the 
clashes in Sarajevo. According to the UNPROFOR commander in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina General Francis Briquemont, they launched 
unprovoked attacks on Serb suburbs in Sarajevo on Tuesday. The 
Bosnian Serbs think that the opening of the Tuzla airport is not 
possible before the Moslem side signs a peace plan for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina because they fear that the Moslems would use 
the Tuzla airport, just like they did the Sarajevo airport, for 
the contraband of arms for their army. 
  Bosnian Serb leaders also said that their forces were not 
besieging the UNPROFOR Canadian battalion in Srebrenica and that 
their request to be freed is unfounded. Akashi said that 
UNPROFOR had still not completed the feasibility study on the 
air strikes, adding that he was leaving for Geneva on Sunday to 
meet the UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. Akashi said 
that he was responsible for the territory of the former Yugoslav 
republics and that he would help the negotiators as much as he 
could because they would rely on on-ground information. He 
expressed hope that this information would help and contribute 
to reaching positive results.

  [Text] We have just received a report that Federal Prime 
Minister Radoje Kontic received Yasushi Akashi, special envoy of 
the UN Secretary General for the former Yugoslavia and a new 
head of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] for Yugoslavia. After 
the talks, which were held behind closed doors, Akashi briefly 
addressed journalists, telling them that he and Kontic discussed 
the declaration issued at the NATO summit, which asks UNPROFOR 
to study the possibilities of protecting Srebrenica and Tuzla 
airport. Akashi announced that he will go to Geneva to meet 
Secretary General Butrus-Ghali and hold consultations on these 
issues. He explained that he and Thorvald Stoltenberg will have 
different obligations and that he will stay on the territory of 
the former Yugoslavia. 
  I will help the negotiators in Geneva as much as I can. They 
will rely on the information that I will send them from the 
field. I think that this will help, and hope that it will bring 
about positive results sooner, Akashi said. Prime Minister 
Kontic and I discussed bilateral relations between the Yugoslav 
Government and UNPROFOR, and must say that I am quite encouraged 
by his views, Akashi told journalists.

  [Text] Belgrade, 13 Jan (TANJUG) -- Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic today received Yasushi Akashi, the UN 
secretary general's special envoy for the former Yugoslavia. 
They discussed the main issues of the Yugoslav crisis and the 
situation in former Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  President Milosevic stressed that the Serbian side has 
complied with the European Union's [EU] demands to provide 33 
percent of the territory [of Bosnia-Herzegovina] for the Muslim 
republic. He also stressed that the signing of the peace 
agreement between the warring sides in the region depends only 
on the Muslim leadership in Sarajevo. 
  The Serb side in the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina 
has not waged war for more than seven months now, and the 
responsibility for the current armed provocations undoubtedly 
lies with the Muslim leadership in Sarajevo. Therefore, 
President Milosevic stressed, the threats of bombing the Serb 
side are incomprehensible. They encourage the Muslim leadership 
to prolong the war and avoid once more the signing of the peace 
agreement, which undermines the efforts invested in the peace 
process so far. 
  According to the assessment of the Republic of Serbia, it 
would be much more useful for international factors to exert 
pressure on the Muslim leadership to accept the peace plan for 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina, whereby peace would be given 
preference over war. 
  President Milosevic told Akashi that the Republic of Serbia 
will continue helping to establish a just and lasting peace in 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina, at the same time working on the 
removal of one-sided assessments by international factors which 
help the war-mongers among the Muslim leaders hold on to their 
illusions that they will achieve their goals through war. 
  Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic also took part 
in the talks.

<F P=106> [Report by Bisera Vukasinovic] </F>
  [Text] The Party of Democratic Action of Sandzak held a 
news conference in Novi Pazar today. Party Secretary Rasim 
Ljajic spoke about the latest Croatian proposal for the 
settlement of the Muslim issue in Bosnia and the NATO 
declaration. Bisera Vukasinovic reports: 
  [Vukasinovic] Tudjman's initiative for a confederation with 
the Muslim state in Bosnia is not a serious proposal. The 
initiative is hiding the desire to divert attention from the 
Croatian aggression in Bosnia and avoid talks on Muslim access 
to the sea, and at the same time to score new points with the 
international community, Rasim Ljajic said. The frivolousness 
of the proposal is illustrated by the fact that a similar 
proposal by the Muslim side on the creation of a joint republic 
was rejected three months ago, he said. 
  Commenting on the NATO summit, Rasim Ljajic said that the 
session did not produce anything new, and that the threats with 
bombing are seen to be more of pressure on the Serbian side than 
a real possibility. Rasim Ljajic devoted most part of his news 
conference to the situation in this region. He accused members 
of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of carrying out searches of 
villages in Pestera and taking in about 1,500 Muslims for 
informative talks. He described this as a planned and long-term 
strategy aimed at changing the demographic structure of the 
population. We asked to be received by the head of the 
Secretariat for Internal Affairs in Novi Pazar and [Interior] 
Minister Sokolovic to discuss the brutal conduct by the police, 
but our request fell on deaf ears, said Rasim Ljajic, secretary 
of the Party of Democratic Action of Sandzak, at the news 
conference in Novi Pazar.

<F P=106> [Report by Guido Rampoldi: "President Says To Papandreou: </F>
`Let Us Meet Soon'"] 
  [Text] Skopje -- Macedonia President Kiro Gligorov has 
launched an appeal, through LA REPUBBLICA, to Greek Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou to hold an urgent meeting to 
initiate negotiations: "I am prepared to meet with him at any 
time. Dialogue is the only reasonable prospect for resolving 
all the pending issues, otherwise the crisis will worsen and we 
risk following the tendency toward chaos that has emerged in the 
Balkans. I believe that we will be able to find a good solution 
to all the issues dividing us, either by resolving them one by 
one, or with a package of comprehensive measures." To do this 
"it is necessary to have a different attitude, as well as the 
awareness that propaganda and emotionalism harm both parties." 
Gligorov, along with Bosnian [President] Izetbegovic, was 
behind the last attempt to save some sort of Yugoslavia (June 
1991), which was sabotaged by Croatia, Serbia, and Slovenia. 
Home to a minuscule Serb minority, Macedonia has so far escaped 
the fate of Bosnia. Nevertheless, we asked him what would 
happen to a multiethnic (Slav and Albanian) Macedonia if Bosnia 
too were divided along ethnic lines. He was keen to confirm 
that Macedonia was different, in that it had a secular tradition 
of Slav-Albanian cohabitation. So what about the paramilitary 
network of Albanian separatists discovered in December, along 
with weapons and a list of 20,000 names? "An isolated 
incident." Gligorov also thinks that it is "impossible" that 
Serbia and Albanians from Tirana or Kosovo would settle their 
territorial quarrels in the same way that Belgrade and Zagreb 
tried to resolve the Krajina question: i.e., by devouring a 
third state (in that case Bosnia, in this case Macedonia). 
Indeed, he is convinced that, despite certain unfavorable 
prognoses that have appeared in the press (some of which are 
attributed to the CIA), "there is a prevailing awareness that 
stability in Macedonia is a condition for peace in the Balkans." 
For this reason, the United States will also recognize Macedonia.

<F P=106> ["P.Dz."-initialed report: "Will Taci Create a Party?"] </F>
  [Text] The PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity] Congress 
Preparatory Committee, acting as the temporary leadership of 
this party has, as we have discovered, definitely given up 
negotiations with the "hard current," headed by Menduh Taci. 
The fruitless attempts to find a compromise with Taci, who 
proclaimed the leadership illegitimate at the Gostivar meeting 
last month, have, after all, been the elementary reasons for the 
repeated postponement of the congress, announced for 15 January. 
The efforts for a compromise between the two currents (the 
Committee and the "hard current") have, as a matter of fact, 
been urged by the Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova. The 
idea was to fuse the Committee and the commission composed of 
members of the "Gostivar meeting" into a new body, which would 
then be in charge of the preparations for the Congress. For 
that purpose mediators from the Coordinating Board of Albanian 
parties (in former Yugoslavia) were elected. However, the 
meeting in Pristina two days ago ended without success, because 
representatives of the "Gostivar meeting" did not arrive. This 
was stated in the report signed by the Pristina mediators Femi 
Agani, Izmi Islami, and Riza Halimi. Thus, it seems that these 
negotiations have ended, nevertheless, well-informed sources 
claim that the Taci group is proceeding with its contacts with 
Tirana. A delegation of this group, headed by Aliriza Loga, 
paid another visit to its "sponsors," as our sources said, and 
recently "a new envoy from Albania" visited Debar [Macedonia]. 
It is even claimed that the Taci group is not very interested 
in the congress, because it intends to form its own party. The 
assemblies of the Tetovo, Gostivar, and Struga branches have not 
taken place (it is a precondition for the congress) and they are 
expected to be held by the end of this week. If that happens, 
the congress could be postponed for a week or two. The Congress 
Preparatory Committee has to put forward presidential candidates 
for the PDP. As we have stated several times, delegate 
Abdurahman Aliti, vice chairman of the Macedonian People's 
Assembly Djeladin Murati, and head of the PDP delegate group 
Muhamed Halili were mentioned as candidates for this function.

  [Excerpt] Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar and Foreign 
Minister Jozef Moravcik met journalists in Bratislava today. The 
prime minister first briefly assessed the Prague talks. We have 
chosen the following essential part of his remarks: 
  [Begin Meciar recording] We assume that, in connection with 
the Partnership for Peace, neither the United States nor NATO 
countries are trying to create any new division line in Europe. 
This is an opportunity and a chance for all. 
  NATO membership is a matter of extraordinary responsibility, 
a matter of further development. The Partnership for Peace does 
not guarantee direct [NATO] membership, but gives a chance to 
take part in preparations for it. 
  We see and understand that the Partnership for Peace is a 
big 
step forward. The Slovak Republic is an active member of the 
North Atlantic Committee for Cooperation, and, within this 
institution, it became a member of several of its bodies. 
  The Partnership for Peace means a qualitatively new 
contribution to security in Central and East Europe and is 
qualitatively different from the present incorporation into the 
North Atlantic Committee for Cooperation. The Partnership for 
Peace contains both political and military aspects. It envisages 
joint military excercises, training, intervention, modeling 
future relationships, and membership in NATO. 
  The Partnership for Peace is not an automatic guarantee of 
security. However, it envisages the possibility of consultation 
with other countries in the event of a military threat. 
  The declaration from Brussels is also important to us. It is 
namely a declaration that NATO expects and welcomes as its 
future members countries neighboring it in the East. This is a 
new element, and, on the basis of this stance, the talk is no 
longer about a yes or a no for membership; the talk is only 
about when and how. This is a marked qualitative shift forward. 
  A framework declaration concerning the sequence of steps 
needed to join the Partnership for Peace was adopted at the 
Brussels summit. We assume that those who subscribe to the 
Partnership for Peace will have to take on themselves the 
following pledges: First, they will pledge to observe the 
principles of democracy, human rights, and minorities' rights. 
  In Europe there are two alternative concepts concerning the 
rights of minorities, one being the concept pushed through by 
the Council of Europe and the other being the one pushed through 
by the Hungarian Republic, the latter being directed toward 
collective rights. President Clinton and his entourage confirmed 
that the rights involved are individual human rights, as the 
[word indistinct] of collective rights as such is unacceptable. 
In this respect, this is exceptionally important international 
political support for the stance taken by the Government of the 
Slovak Republic. 
  Second, these countries must pledge that they will 
unconditionally accept the principle of the inviolability of 
borders. 
  The remaining topic of discussion for us is the southern 
border. We are holding talks with the Hungarian Government 
specifically about the adoption of this principle. Our position 
on this matter is thus reconfirmed and is advantageous to us. 
  The next thing envisaged is civilian control over the Army 
and the transparency of the military budget. NATO countries and 
the countries that will become members of the Partnership for 
Peace should sign an agreement to this effect. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Edited" version of news conference given by Prime Minister </F>
Vladimir Meciar and Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik on 12 
January after the Visegrad summit; presented by editors Jarmila 
Tosecka and Ivo Kunsh; passages within quotation marks are 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Kunsh] [passage omitted] I quote the first 
question. It is said that the Visegrad summit could become an 
impulse to expand U.S. economic interests in Central Europe. The 
question is whether Slovakia would not be left on the margin of 
the economic sphere in the same way it is being left out in some 
political relations. 
  [Meciar] "First of all, during the talks, the interest of 
the 
United States in direct cooperation was stressed. On the 
contrary, Mr. Clinton made a statement to the effect that the 
United States would not exclude us from anything. [passage 
omitted] 
  "On the contrary, President Clinton himself is in favor of 
doing away with barriers in bilateral trade exchange. He favors 
greater openness of markets and the weakening of the 
protectionist policy aimed at imports from our country, all of 
this to make better economic cooperation possible. His statement 
that the United States will economically support Slovakia is 
very important for us. It is especially important because many 
banking circles have been waiting just for this kind of a 
statement by the President so that some credit lines that are 
under preparation could open." [passage omitted] 
  [Tosecka] An editor from the Hungarian section of Slovak 
Radio was interested in knowing what the content of bilateral 
talks with the Hungarian partners was, especially whether there 
was an agreement on resuming the talks that allegedly were 
suspended last year. 
  [Meciar] "We had various talks. Foreign Minister Moravcik 
will speak about his part and I about mine. 
  "Prime Minister Boross and I have met. We have discussed 
both--the issues concerning the Visegrad Four and bilateral 
relations. We have said that so far the attitudes to 
controversial issues--that is, ethnic minorities and 
Gabcikovo--were irrational and damaging to both countries. We 
agreed that we have to find new points of departure to resolve 
these issues. We cannot continue harming ourselves by impairing 
the trustworthiness of each other. We have fully agreed on this. 
  "As for the concept of future development, the Hungarian 
Government is affected by the coming May elections. It is very 
complicated to enter this process through extensive measures now. 
  "We expressed Slovakia's willingness to conclude the 
so-called big agreement. We expressed our readiness to hold 
consultations on all matters of interest. We expressed our 
readiness to work faster in setting up a customs union. We dealt 
with the readmission agreement and the related subsequent issues 
of opening customs checkpoints on the borders. However, we will 
leave the crucial decisions for the time after elections." 
  [Moravcik] [passage omitted] "[Foreign] Minister Jeszenszky 
and I have confirmed our interest in continuing our intensive 
contacts to clarify some open issues." [passage omitted] 
  [Kunsh] An Arab journalist was interested in knowing whether 
there are any obstacles to arms production and arms trade in 
Slovakia. 
  [Meciar] "The Slovak arms industry in 1993 produced only 8-9 
percent of its 1989 capacity. [passage omitted] 
  "An analysis that we carried out has shown that our 
essential 
shortcoming is that we had lost market since the arms trading 
and arms-trading institutions did not exist. That is why we have 
set up a state-owned shareholding company in which several 
ministries participate. This company will be involved in arms 
exports and imports. 
  "The development in Slovakia continued and goes on at 
present 
as well. Its quality is relatively high. The systems that have 
been developed and tested or are undergoing tests meet world 
parameters. Of course, we will offer them to the market, and the 
Slovak Army will be equiped with them as well. 
  "Regions to which this technology will or will not be 
exported are the subject of a licensing procedure." [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "Vitally Important Decision; </F>
NATO--Cornerstone of European Security"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--Jan Lisuch, state secretary at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic, on Friday [7 
January] presented to representatives of the NATO member 
countries' and Visegrad Group countries' missions in Bratislava 
an aide memoire [French term used] on the coming NATO summit. 
The same text of the aide memoire was presented by Ivan Mjartan, 
Slovak ambassador in the Czech Republic, to ambassadors of NATO 
countries residing in Prague. 
  The text of the aide memoire has concurrently been sent to 
the Slovak Republic's representative missions in NATO member 
countries and to NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner. It 
states: 
  On the unexplored path of transformation, the countries of 
Central Europe are facing a number of difficulties and 
challenges, including the lack of security guarantees. The 
existing security vacuum and the possible destabilizing impact 
of negative developments nearby could have a negative influence 
on democratic structures and the process of economic 
transformation in this region. 
  The Slovak Republic, like the other countries of the 
Visegrad 
Group, has made the vitally important political decision of 
seeking integration into the European and transatlantic 
political, economic, and security structures. The Slovak 
Republic therefore launched a number of diplomatic activities 
aimed at demonstrating its desire and readiness to be integrated 
into NATO without needless delay. NATO, as the cornerstone of 
the European security architecture, has demonstrated its 
competence and ability in defending democratic gains. 
  The Slovak Republic assumes that the coming NATO summit will 
mean the beginning of a new stage in building a higher form of 
partnership with the Visegrad Group countries and will enable 
the expansion of NATO through the admission of these countries 
of Central Europe. The Slovak Republic expects the alliance to 
provide a clear and unequivocal reply to the questions of 
security of our continent, perceived as particularly acute in 
our region. 
  The Slovak Republic evaluates highly NATO's Partnership for 
Peace project, initiated by the U.S. Administration, and is 
ready to join it and to actively participate in projects and 
missions within its framework. This project will undoubtedly 
contribute to a marked intensification of cooperation between 
the Slovak Republic and NATO and its member countries on 
political and military issues. 
  The Slovak Republic would like to express its conviction 
that 
the NATO summit of January 1994 will realistically assess the 
present security situation in the new democracies of the Central 
European region and that the United States and its allies within 
the framework of the alliance will take into consideration the 
expectations of these countries regarding NATO membership, will 
not hesitate, and will offer to the countries of the Visegrad 
Group NATO membership, thereby reinforcing the general stability 
in this sensitive part of Europe. 
  In the spirit of the concept of accommodating foreign 
policy, 
the Slovak Republic pursues its own national interests--peaceful 
cooperation based on guaranteed security in its region, freedom 
of citizens in their democratic state, and economic prosperity.

Be Dismantled Within Three Years"] 
  [Text] Prague--The SS-23 surface-to-surface missiles that 
the Czech Army took over from the former Federal Army will be 
withdrawn from its ordnance and dismantled before 1996. This is 
apparent from the information made available to RUDE PRAVO by Z. 
Borkovec, press spokesman for the Defense Ministry. He refused 
to reply to questions on how many missiles there are on our 
territory and where they will be dismantled. We found out from 
other sources that the Research and Testing Institute in 
Slavicin has looked into dismantling the missiles, and their 
actual dismantling should be carried out by the military unit in 
Bohuslavice nad Vlari near Zlin. According to Borkovec, the 
metal parts of the missiles will be scrapped following their 
removal, and the Army will offer the chemical compounds to 
select organizations for further evaluation or ecological 
elimination.

  [Text] Food imports from the Czech Republic have added at 
least 1 billion korunas to Slovakia's deficit in the balance of 
payments with the Czech Republic. 
  According to Milan Filo, director of the Department of Trade 
at the Slovak Ministry of Agriculture, such imports are the 
result of the surviving federal structure of agriculture, which 
concentrates final food production in the Czech Republic. Among 
the main produce still imported by Slovakia are poultry, dairy 
and bakery products, margarine, spirits, and tobacco.

  [Text] A few minutes ago we received from Prague a 
recording of statements made by [Slovak] Prime Minister Vladimir 
Meciar and [Czech] Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus on the results of 
their talks today. Here are they in their full length version. 
  [Begin recording] [Meciar] The meeting between the 
delegations of the Slovak and Czech Governments have just 
finished. The delegations were led by us, the two prime 
ministers. 
  During this meeting, we told the Czech Government our stance 
on the cooperation within Visegrad Four, as well as on some 
other critical statements made recently, especially in Poland. 
I would like to stress that the Government of the Slovak 
Republic considers all the steps taken by the Czech Republic in 
order to protect its political and security interests to be 
fully legitimate. The criticism was one-sided, and simplified 
matters, and we do not identify ourselves with this criticism. 
In this respect, we express our full support for the steps 
taken by the Government of the Czech Republic to defend its own 
interests. 
  We have analyzed issues related to the Partnership for 
Peace. 
We agreed that (?our) stance is approximately identical. The 
Slovak side accepts this initiative without any reservations. 
  We have also dealt with issues concerning the agreements we 
had concluded in years 1992 and 1993 and the fulfillment of the 
obligations ensuing from them. By coincidence, in two weeks, it 
will be one year ago that, in the very same room, we were 
working on the currency division. It seems that the system 
which was set up is [word indistinct]. A meeting of the 
representatives of the customs union will take place this week, 
the interior ministers will meet to discuss borders. 
  We have also debated the improvement of economic 
cooperation. 
In this area, the interest of both sides on the priorities we 
have is fully legitimate. In 1994 we shall continue to support 
the economic cooperation in 1994 as well as in the next period. 
  These, approximately, were the main topics that we dwelt on 
during our talks. 
  [Klaus] Thank you very much. I really agree with this 
information on our meeting. I would like to underline three 
issues. 
  First, I expressed to the Slovak side and the Slovak 
Government an appreciation for a hundred-percent observation of 
the agreements that we had concluded between the Czech and 
Slovak Republics, especially for the immediate settlement of the 
debt on the clearing account. We consider this to be a very 
good signal and a sign that the pessimists who foresaw a 
deterioration in cooperation in all the areas between our 
countries are wrong. We are very pleased that this happened the 
way it did, and I would like to underline it here. 
  Second, we talked about the Partnership for Peace, to be 
more 
exact, about our very, very close if not identical views. 
  Third, we talked about the very close views on the 
cooperation between the countries of the so-called Visegrad 
Four. I think that both sides are well aware that we are 
painstakingly seeking to find the highest common denominator in 
the views of these four countries. The fact that we are not able 
to do everything as a foursome is in no way caused by any 
individuals on this or the other side but by the real interests 
of these countries. [end recording]

  [Text] Representatives of the Slovak delegation to the 
Prague summit gave a news conference in the Hotel Praha at 1600 
hours. Jarmila Tosecka, our reporter, was there and she compiled 
the following report. 
  [Begin recording] [Tosecka] Questions put by many 
journalists, including foreign ones, were answered by President 
Michal Kovac, Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, Foreign Minister 
Jozef Moravcik, and Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak. 
  These questions could be summed up in the following basic 
areas: prospects for the future cooperation among the Visegrad 
four countries, the importance of the Partnership for Peace 
project for the countries involved and specifically for the 
Slovak Republic, Slovakia's relations with Hungary, the problem 
of the Hungarian minority as well as Slovak relations with 
Russia, and future contacts between Slovakia and the Czech 
Republic. 
  In reply, Prime Minister Meciar again confirmed closeness of 
views whether on the project "Partnership for Peace" where, as 
the Czech side, Slovakia regarded individual approach as being 
realistic. He also assessed positively other areas of mutual 
relations. According to Meciar, Slovakia was interested in good 
and useful cooperation among the Visegrad four countries, but 
the existing course and results were not as we have expected. 
It is necessary to intensify cooperation, otherwise this group 
would disintegrate only to be replaced by bilateral relations. 
  Asked whether a visit to Bratislava by President Clinton was 
discussed, President Michal Kovac replied: Yes, we have repeated 
our invitation to the celebrations of the 50th anniversay of the 
Slovak national uprising. We have presented to the U.S. 
President an album containing documentary evidence. Bill 
Clinton promised that if he himself could not come he would 
certainly send his envoy to Bratislava. 
  Minister Jozef Moravcik confirmed, among other things, that 
the Slovak Republic was ready to sign immediately a framework 
agreement on Partnership for Peace. This was also confirmed by 
Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak. Foreign Minister Moravcik 
also replied to questions concerning the minorities problem. 
After the news conference ended, I put to him the following 
question: Before the Prague summit, the Hungarian daily 
NEPSZABADSZAG said the meeting in Komarno of Hungarian minority 
representatives last Saturday was taking place in the shadow of 
the Prague summit. At the same time it cast a shadow on that 
summit. During your talks with your Hungarian partner, could 
you also detect this shadow? 
  [Moravcik] In my view, one should not overestimate the 
importance of that event. In a democratic environment, it is on 
the whole usual that somewhat more extreme views are presented. 
We appreciate the way that event passed off, the fact no anti- 
constitutional step was taken, and that everything is a subject 
of discussion [passage indistinct]. 
  [Tosecka] How would you characterize your talks today with 
the Hungarian side? 
  [Moravcik] The talks were of a general character, as we had 
little time. Problems raised were rather numerous. There was 
not enough time to enable us to devote ourselves to individual 
questions. Both sides, however, demonstrated strong political 
will to reach a consensus very quickly so that we would not have 
to spend too much energy on tackling certain problems and 
instead concentrate rather on issues tackled here. 
  [Tosecka] As a government representative, how would you 
assess the conclusions of this Prague summit. What does it 
means for Slovakia? 
  [Moravcik] For Slovakia it means opportunity, and one has to 
make use of that opportunity. [end recording]
