  [Text] Budapest, Jan 13 (AFP) -- Central European 
countries asked Ukraine to return 200 million kilowatt-hours of 
extra electric energy it drew from their joint Centrel electric 
system, the head of the Hungarian national electricity 
distributor, Antal Tombor, said Thursday. 
  The unplanned Ukrainian electric energy imports, which 
started in November after the energy supply situation within 
Ukraine became critical, "caused economic damage to consumers 
belonging to the system", Tombor told the VILAGGAZDASAG economic 
daily. 
  Electricity suppliers in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, 
Poland, Romania, Hungary and the eastern part of Germany set a 
January 21 deadline for Ukraine to return the extra energy, 
drawn after these states' grids were separated from the Russian 
and Ukraine-Bulgarian electricity grids in November. 
  Hungary supplied a quarter of the extra energy to Ukraine 
but 
practically all other central European states were affected by 
the unplanned draws, which caused "considerable frequency 
fluctuation" in the Centrel system, Tombor said. He added 
however that Hungary had not had to introduce any consumption 
restrictions due to the extra Ukrainian consumption, but 
electric appliances here slowed down and were overstrained. 
  Currently, only a 400- and a 200-kilovolt electric conductor 
is in use between Hungary and Ukraine after the main 
750-kilovolt line went out of use in November. The central grid 
is to be reconnected with the Russian and Ukrainian electricity 
grids after mid-May, he said.

<F P=106> [Article by Ilie Serbanescu: "An Awful Triumph"] </F>
  [Text] Whether we realize it or not, these days Romania is 
going through one of the most turbulent moments of its history. 
For a short while, after the 1989 December events (about which 
we did not know much at the time they occurred) we believed we 
would be able to start living a normal life, escape from 
uncivilized poverty and an aberrant international isolation in 
an era of the most acute "shrinking" of the planet, due to the 
impact of the formidable progress made in the field of 
electronics and telecommunication. We had signs long ago that 
this aspiration was but an illusion (and, in a tragic way, not 
long after that significant December 1989). But now we are 
absolutely sure of it. The West has dealt a mortal blow to the 
Romanians. Or, at least to the naive people who believed that 
ultimately, salvation from the West would reach us. The West 
has robbed Romanians of hope. 
  We can advance toward a normal life only through our own 
efforts and with the indispensable assistance of those we saw 
living a normal life, that is, the West. It is difficult to 
evaluate the percentage, but most probably at least half of the 
contribution must belong to us. That is, we have to start 
living a normal life, to work hard and become productive, to get 
seriously organized in order to become efficient, and to be 
merciless with ourselves in order to be able to confront 
successfully an equally merciless international competition that 
characterizes the end of the 20th century and the beginning of 
the third millennia. We also have to be aware of the fact that 
the values of democracy and the market economy must be promoted 
because we indeed need them, and not because somebody somewhere 
asks us to do so. The second half of the contribution in the 
aforementioned proportion was expected to come from the West. 
And a contribution of 50 percent is still not an exaggeration, 
because this would not have meant immediate money and advice, 
but rather the adequate political pressure that would direct us, 
and even drag us if necessary, toward a normal life in those 
many cases and situations in which the old mentalities and 
structures fiercely opposed it. Currently the West is 
announcing officially, even if it maintains a screen of bare 
words, that Romania is not part of its world. NATO is 
officially declaring that it has no intention of guaranteeing 
security for the former communist countries from the new Russian 
empire, guarantee that cannot exist in reality except if these 
countries join NATO. But there is something else even more 
tragic! If such an admission to NATO takes place, this will be 
achieved in two phases: first the "Central European" countries 
and never the "East European" countries. The American president 
who came to Europe to sanction the policy of the West toward the 
East, communicated to this to Romania through the fact that 
after his stay in Central Europe he flew directly to Moscow. If 
we acknowledge the American thesis, namely that Mr. Clinton did 
not stop in Prague to seal Central Europe's blessing and 
excommunicate East Europe, then, there can be only one, even 
more annoying interpretation, for this discriminatory visit as 
far as Romania's aspirations are concerned. Mr. Clinton went 
there to appease those who not only thought that the West will 
help them to emerge from their "eastern condemnation" but also 
did all they could to change themselves and receive the alms and 
assistance of the West. 
  It is clear now that there was no question of Romania's 
admission even being discussed at all. Those who believed that 
the West's reticence toward Romania was due to the leadership in 
Bucharest were mistaken. The reality was exactly the opposite. 
The leadership structure in Bucharest is the way it is 
precisely because Romania was not considered even for a moment 
as part of the Western sphere but as part of the Russian sphere. 
Those who believed that the West would not indefinitely accept 
that the old structures remain unchanged in Romania and the 
reform aimed at a market economy has not been implemented, were 
naive people. The reality is that the West was less than 
marginally interested in our country, because Romania was not 
and will not be part of its world. 
  Those who led our destinies -- probably were aware of this 
-- 
through the current official NATO decision, experience these 
days a real triumph. They can prove now that Romania's 
association to the Western world does not take place not because 
of them, that is, because of the communist restoration or the 
blocking of the reform, but because of the West itself, which 
has showed that it does not want us. As a matter of fact, they 
did their duty formally and advanced the request to join the 
NATO, when it was clear that in no way can such a thing come 
into question. The excommunicatory treatment applied to 
Romanians -- who, contrary to the Central Europeans, are 
considered in the West as people from the other side of the 
fence -- is a shattering additional argument for the "Eastern" 
statute of Romania. 
  What else can the Romanians do? The ideal reaction -- or 
better said idealistic reaction -- would be if they obstinately 
progressed on the path of democracy and of market economy in 
spite of the leadership in Bucharest which is not really in 
favor of it. In a way, it would be a case of promoting a 
"pro-Western" attitude without the West. These are impossible 
prospects because we did not do it before, not even when it was 
believed that the West is with us!

<F P=106> [Interview with Tudor Mohora, vice president of the </F>
Socialist Party of Labor, by Peter Sragher; place and date not 
given: "The PSM Does Not Wish To Resume the Construction of 
Socialism"] 
  [Text] [Sragher] County conferences of the Socialist 
Party of Labor [PSM] are currently taking place and are meant to 
prepare the congress of the party due at the beginning of this 
year. I thought that it would be interesting to find out the 
political opinion of Mr. Tudor Mohora, one of the leaders of 
this party, regarding this issue. 
  Mr. Mohora, you affirmed that the PDSR [Social Democracy 
Party of Romania] called itself a social-democratic party, thus 
a left-center party, which is ruling with right-wing measures. 
How can you support a different party in parliament and a 
different cabinet? 
  [Mohora] We are in a somehow different situation today than 
right after the September 1992 elections. A possible answer to 
your question might be that, when we decided to support the 
ruling party, we took into consideration its program and the 
political signals that they released during the electoral 
campaign. 
  Today, we have a certain critical attitude toward the 
government, the act of ruling itself, and our criticism ended in 
a simple motion, which however we could not promote further. 
After one year of ruling, we can no longer talk about 
declarations of intent, but we can talk about the act of 
governing, which has unfolded for long enough for us to have a 
proper picture of it. 
  [Sragher] If the PDSR is ruling with right-wing measures, 
some of your voters are claiming that they should better allow 
the opposition to govern. How real does the possibility of the 
opposition's governing seem to you? 
  [Mohora] I have studied the program and situation of the 
opposition carefully. Having a complete belief in the 
democratic system that we are currently building in our country, 
not only I do not exclude it, but I even believe that it is 
desirable that, in certain phases, the opposition should have a 
chance to govern. Unfortunately -- it is not I who judges them, 
but public opinion itself passes a judgment -- currently the 
opposition does not have a coherent picture of an economic and 
social construction. It is known that, although in the last 
part of this century there have been certain converging elements 
between the liberal and the social-democratic perspectives, both 
as doctrines and as pictures of the society, however, they stay 
far apart. 
  [Sragher] You criticize the heterogeneous character of the 
CDR [Democratic Convention of Romania]. The PRM [Greater 
Romania Party] has only a national doctrine, just like the PUNR 
[National Romanian Unity Party], which, however, very recently 
called itself neoliberal, following the example of the PDAR 
[Democratic Agrarian Party of Romania], which, however, also 
assumes the agrarian doctrine. How homogeneous and viable is a 
possible future agreement with the parties that have such 
different ideologies? 
  [Mohora] Well, certainly your question is very interesting 
and at the same time very difficult, but I believe that the 
answer to this question can be found in the responsibility and 
the idea of compromise that should govern us when we accept such 
a political alliance. The parties that you have mentioned might 
be criticized just like we can be criticized for certain aspects 
or, probably, for certain limitations in our policy. However, 
we have the following concept: We should be open and the 
democratic system requires -- if we understand the basic rule of 
democracy, which is ultimately a sublimation of tolerance -- 
that, if needed, one can set up alliances even with parties -- 
and such thing has already happened throughout history in 
Romania -- that are on the other side of the barricade. We have 
constantly said that we must be open and discuss issues 
regarding our country with all parties, regardless of their 
orientation, including the right-wing parties. 
  [Sragher] Do you have a national unity government in mind? 
  [Mohora] Yes, I do. As long as there are people outside our 
country's borders who are observing -- maybe from a more neutral 
position, that is, they are more detached from the political 
excitement -- that here one might reach -- and it is high time 
to reach -- an agreement on principles and on rules regarding 
major issues in the domestic and foreign policy of our country, 
that can be accepted by all of us. I believe that this would 
lead to the idea of a national unity government. 
  [Sragher] Suppose tomorrow you become prime minister. What 
would be the first three major measures taken by you in order to 
solve the current crisis of our country? 
  [Mohora] First of all a strong government is required. It 
should be strong both in the area of professional competence and 
in its moral force and the honesty of the people it includes, as 
well as in its team spirit. I believe that the PSM could form a 
strong government. It would need not only three, but a whole 
set of measures. First of all, those government decisions and 
those laws should be adopted and promoted that would put order 
in the public sector. If the government and society have such 
an important public sector, it should not be left -- as it has 
happened so far -- unattended. A second issue would refer to 
the real stimulation of the private sector. Currently I believe 
that there are no appropriate conditions, neither legislative 
nor governmental ones, that would enable a small entrepreneur to 
start a business and be successful. Currently, a monopoly and a 
banking system have been established, which are a wizardry that 
pumps very important funds into firms that, in most cases, do 
not have a productive character, but rather a character of 
financial-banking and commercial profiteering. The third 
measure: Precisely the team that I was talking about should 
start a merciless war against corruption. This affliction that 
I believe continues to expand is -- to say the least -- 
tolerated by the current leadership. This would mean to put 
order in the police and justice system. We can put our own 
house in order by persistently implementing daily measures and 
actions. In fact, our country has reached such a dramatic 
situation that, as a matter of fact, a concrete anti-crisis 
program should be adopted by a government that would have all 
fields of activity in mind. 
  [Sragher] Does the PSM believe that the construction of 
socialism should resume? 
  [Mohora] No. The PSM believes that we should establish 
the state of law because, in our program, we recognized and 
included, without any reticence, the provisions of Romania's 
Constitution. However, we should make sure that this 
establishment of the state of law serves the national interests, 
namely the reform, our integration in European structures, etc. 
and should be in Romania's favor. Secondly, the ordinary 
citizen should detect and perceive this state of law as a major 
advantage compared to the past regime. Unfortunately, one 
cannot say that, according to the way things have developed in 
the past four years, the citizen feels more protected or a 
greater social and legal, or even physical, security than before. 
  [Sragher] In what way did you support the idea of 
privatization? 
  [Mohora] From the very beginning, we agreed to privatization 
in agriculture and in the sphere of services, which should be 
much more developed, in commerce, and tourism. But 
privatization can be done in all areas -- apart from the energy 
system, telecommunications, transportation, and the defense 
industry -- on the basis of economic profitability and the 
privatization process should even be speeded up. 
  [Sragher] Do you believe that the Euro-Atlantic integration 
is a positive act? 
  [Mohora] We have spoken out without reticence in favor of 
integration in the European structures, both in the political 
area as well as economic and cultural areas. Those who believe 
that the PSM wishes to find answers for the renewal of the 
Romanian society in other regions of the world are greatly 
mistaken. We do not see integration under all circumstances, 
but rather under conditions that should really serve Romania. 
We desire a position of dignity and equity in relations with 
the countries that are members of the European Union's 
structures and also a real promotion of our interests on 
essential, cardinal issues such as integration into the NATO 
structures. 
  As far as foreign bases are concerned, our position is on 
this issue is that the Romanian Parliament and the Romanian 
people should be consulted. These are not issues that belong 
exclusively to the government or the president. 
  [Sragher] Can we understand that currently the PSM would 
oppose the deployment of NATO bases on Romanian territory? 
  [Mohora] In the leadership of our party we have not 
established a position regarding NATO. However, I could not say 
that now, if Romania were invited to enter NATO structures, the 
PSM would certainly oppose such actions. We would decide about 
it after we took into account the respective circumstances at 
the time when such a proposal is made. Because the balance of 
forces certainly will be different in six months time or a 
year's time and the geostrategic picture will also be different. 
There is no point in discussing now how we would relate to such 
an issue. We cannot be against integration in a security system 
that would be to our advantage. 
  As far as our position on a foreign basis is concerned, we 
have a determined position: We do not wish the deployment of 
foreign bases on our country's territory. 
  [Sragher] Do you believe that Romania's joining or not 
joining a security system also depends on Russia? How do you 
regard the new political games after the announcement of the 
military doctrine and the strengthening of the army after the 
October coup? 
  [Mohora] I believe that one should not ignore the warnings 
that Russia is launching toward all countries that formerly were 
part of the "cordon sanitaire" between it and the Western world, 
when it demands that no political-military alliances should be 
established that might be directed against it. 
  Russia believes that every alliance in Europe in which it is 
not included is directed against it or in some way opposing it. 
In fact, this is an old political concept. The more so since 
Russia had and continues to have a global vision about foreign 
policy and cannot give up and will not be able to give in the 
future either -- except maybe under certain circumstances -- 
this idea. 
  A healthy policy in this respect would be if Romania adopted 
a very prudent attitude on the issue of military integration and 
security structures, that are still not consolidated. We can 
see that the situation of establishing relations in this area is 
still vague. Forcing for example the issue of integration in 
military structures might create in the future reactions and 
might mark our relations with our very powerful neighbors, which 
possess the nuclear weapon and which, even if they currently 
face economic difficulties, still hold the statute of great 
military powers. And this might be harmful to our country's 
interests.

to be heard himself. In a state with democratic traditions 
dialogue is the most direct way to the truth. Videnov was not 
confused and he selected that way. Regardless of how arrogantly 
Mr. Filip Dimitrov behaves, the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] 
has shown that it is a party of clear words. After all it was 
the BSP and no one else that initiated the famous roundtable 
four years ago. It was precisely this roundtable that confirmed 
that the BSP is not afraid of dialogue. In this context the 
visit to 134 Rakovski Street was not an incident or a casual 
whim. It is a part of a deliberate course of behavior that has 
already helped up with our hesitant steps in democracy. 
  The reaction to Videnov's appearance at the SDS headquarters 
was not only stormy but also varied. Every interested 
politician is trying to view it, interpret it, and use it in 
accordance with his own interests. If you read DEMOKRATSIYA you 
can see how much speculation can be squeezed in one article, the 
irresponsible nature of which is evident not only regarding 
relations with the political opponent, but also regarding the 
SDS's own interest. If you read the declaration of the Civic 
Alliance for the Republic you will understand what certain 
political forces fear. It appears that the Bulgarian political 
arena is still not prepared for normal, albeit unexpected, 
meetings. Torn by suspicion, our society constantly seeks 
something sensational or secret, and that confuses it. Certain 
irresponsible journalists, who prefer fantasy to truth, 
contribute to this situation. 
  Unfortunately, Videnov's visit to the SDS headquarters, 
which 
lasted 90 minutes, created confusion in certain BSP circles. 
Responsible figures in the BSP regarded the visit as 
irresponsible. They tend to see the visit as a compromise 
serving the interests of the other side. This is wrong and it 
must worry us not only because it breeds suspicion, but also 
because it evokes alarm as a position. Already at the 14th 
Congress, which created the BSP, it was loftily declared that 
the BSP will be a party of dialogue, political contacts, 
pluralism, and cooperation in all issues of democratic 
development. Zhan Videnov was simply putting this statement 
into effect. He went to Filip Dimitrov not in order to make 
compromises or create intrigues, but to study the other side's 
position and express the BSP position on certain issues. Those 
issues are of national interest, and this relieves Videnov of 
any hesitation he might have had about the meeting. It is 
precisely in this element that those who were confused by the 
meeting could not grasp the scope of the political task, and 
they therefore became confused. What is amazing is that some of 
those who became confused have never declared their opposition 
to dialogue as the essence of socialist policy. On the 
contrary, they often themselves participated in contacts with 
different political forces. 
  Rejecting or not understanding Zhan Videnov's initiative is 
one of the many typical mistakes that certain people allow in 
their thinking. They often place their own political ambitions 
above the political interest, or what is worse, in principle 
they prefer confrontation to the complex but purposeful gambit. 
We have often been able to convince ourselves that 
confrontation builds up self- esteem, but it does not trace a 
new road. It might improve our self-esteem in our own eyes at a 
given moment, but it can never ensure our success. Indeed, the 
great drama of the SDS lies in its unwillingness to understand 
this simple truth. Why should we be the victims of the same 
mistake? The dialogue Zhan Videnov proposed to our political 
opponent does not undermine the BSP's prestige in any way. It 
only shows that the BSP is the calmer and wiser political force 
and that in the name of the great public interest it is prepared 
to talk with everyone, even those who deliberately refuse to 
take our real name into consideration. 
  It is time for all those who formulate the BSP's policy to 
understand that a bold and unconventional move in relations with 
others is better than the traditional fear of surprises. 
Surprises are a part of the political "theater," and those who 
create or welcome them win points in the political game. Zhan 
Videnov's visit must be assessed on merit from this point of 
view. He did not go to the SDS headquarters to seek prestige, 
as DEMOKRATSIYA wrongly alleges, but to demonstrate prestige and 
to show our society that the BSP has no fear of expressing its 
opinion to anyone. This is more than useful at the beginning of 
the 1994 political season. Tomorrow Filip Dimitrov will find it 
much more difficult to cheat and maneuver, because he already 
knows what the Socialists think not only about the situation 
within the SDS itself, but also about the Presidency, the 
cabinet, the work of parliament, the budget, the Election Law, 
the future elections, the Supreme Judicial council, and many 
other issues that should be resolved soon. Things were 
expressed in a clear and open manner without any maneuvering. 
Speculating with the issue is harmful. If speculations 
nevertheless emerge, they will not change anything. 
  The BSP can be calm about the outcome of the meeting. It 
will not complicate its position in society in any way. On the 
contrary, it will only confirm its sober attitude toward all 
issues discussed. I will again stress that a policy of dialogue 
is better than a policy of covered cards. The purpose of the 
meeting was not to demand sacrifices from anyone, pressurize 
individual political forces, or preserve the status quo. It was 
a meeting for a typical exchange of information. Therefore, no 
one need imagine that there will be unexpected changes in the 
political landscape. The poles remain. Nevertheless, it is 
better for everyone that the poles hear each other before they 
engage in their regular parliamentary and extraparliamentary 
snowballs fights. After all, sometimes such fights can be 
avoided for the sake of the common national tranquility. 
  This article could end here if the Presidency had not 
expressed its opinion. Like certain political leaders, Dr. 
Zhelev hastened to say that he did not like the meeting between 
Zhan Videnov and Filip Dimitrov, and that the meeting was 
prompted by some "severe crisis" in the BSP and the SDS. We 
cannot speak for the SDS, but on behalf of the BSP we must say 
that the president is alarmingly wrong, or is simply not aware 
of the realities, or is a victim of his own imagination. There 
are many things in the BSP, but no trace of a crisis. There are 
different opinions and assessments of issues, even ideological 
disputes, but for the time being at least there is nothing 
serious that could jeopardize the monolithic character of the 
party. It is and will certainly continue to be the biggest and 
strongest Bulgarian political party. As a former member of our 
party (and may the president forgive us for reminding him of 
this), Zhelyu Zhelev knows very well that we, Socialists, have a 
sense of responsibility and duty even when we quarrel. We were 
not born yesterday and will not disappear tomorrow. Unlike his 
blue ideas, our ideas have roots and a future. Therefore, if he 
wants to be just, let him not confuse his wishful thinking with 
reality. Otherwise he will err, and his post is such that the 
smallest error could place him in a very uncomfortable 
situation. The BSP is a sufficiently mature party and knows 
precisely how to overcome its own weaknesses. Therefore, the 
crisis the president invokes is not in the BSP, but somewhere 
else. Perhaps somewhere near him, but let us not pursue this. 
The gentleman is smart enough to answer this for himself. 
  And so an absolutely normal dialogue between two political 
forces is causing serious excitement in Bulgaria. This is at 
once wonderful and alarming. It shows that society has great 
expectations, but its nerves are rather weak. We still have not 
achieved the psychological balance we need. Suspicion still is 
stronger than confidence. However, let us not despair. We need 
time. Many more meetings and talks are necessary for us to 
realize that it is better to talk to each other than pass each 
other like deaf people. In this sense Zhan Videnov has DUMA's 
support, as well as the support of all those who regard his 
political initiative as positive.

  [Excerpts] There was a festive session held in Sarajevo 
today to mark the repelling of one of the strongest offensives 
in the 1st Corps' operational zone. The session was attended by 
Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, Foreign Minister Irfan 
Ljubijankic, [names indistinct], heads of the Executive Council 
and Assembly of the City of Sarajevo. Those fighters of the 1st 
Corps who had contributed most to the repelling of the enemy 
offensive were presented with the appropriate decorations. Here 
is a report by [name indistinct] 
  [Correspondent] At the beginning of the session, the 
fighters and their officers were addressed by Brigadier (Ismet 
Dahic), deputy commander of the 1st Corps. He stressed that the 
fighters had been prepared for the enemy offensive, which 
started on 21 December, and that despite 40,000 shells fired and 
the fact that Chetnik [word indistinct] units took part in these 
battles, the fighters of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina at the 
end turned the situation to their advantage. 
  After that (Dahic) presented decorations to the members of 
the brigades whose fighters took part in these battles on behalf 
of the Corps commander. They will be handed to them 
subsequently. [passage omitted] 
  We have reached the half-way stage, Foreign Minister 
Ljubijankic said. The other half could be even more difficult, 
but what we have done so far compels us to go further. 
  Finally, the fighters were addressed by Prime Minister 
Silajdzic, who was greeted with a long applause. He conveyed to 
the fighters greetings from President Izetbegovic, who was 
unable to attend. Speaking about the future of the Geneva talks, 
Silajdzic stressed that if the aggressor continues to destroy 
Sarajevo and other towns and to kill civilians during the Geneva 
talks, the talks will not be held. 
  There is certain fear abroad of a republic in which the 
Muslims would constitute a majority, Silajdzic said. That this 
fear is not founded is best illustrated by the conduct of the 
members of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina on the territories 
under their control. People of other nationalities are not being 
expelled. Places of worship are not being destroyed. Only 
criminals should be afraid of such an army, Silajdzic said. 
  This was a brief summary of what was said at today's festive 
session organized to mark the repelling of a fierce enemy 
offensive.

  [Text] As the Press Center of the Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina reports, after Franjo Tudjman's Bosnian 
initiative on the confederation of Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the war criminal Radovan Karadzic has made 
it public that he is also considering coming out with a proposal 
on a confederation of all states that have appeared in these 
regions. Let us recall that the last attempt to save peace on 
the territory of former Yugoslavia was the initiative of Alija 
Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
and Kiro Gligorov, president of Macedonia, on forming a 
confederation of south Slav states. 
  The greater state appetites of Slobodan Milosevic and Franjo 
Tudjman, and the desire of the citizens of Slovenia, Croatia, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Macedonia to break free from the 
Belgrade Bolshevik hegemony then came into direct confrontation. 
The former Yugoslav People's Army was used as the fiercest 
defender of such a hegemony, simply because it was the only 
guarantor of the high standard of living for its officers and of 
the high budget earmarked for the Army. 
  The war criminal Radovan Karadzic, if this is his idea, is 
too late in starting to think independently, and if he is still 
a mere mouthpiece for Milosevic's ideas, he is then offering us 
one more deceit, the umpteenth prison of the South Slav peoples. 
After they themselves broke up the now already former 
Yugoslavia, after hundreds of thousands of people have been 
killed in war, after expelling, displacing, or forcing the 
emigration of more than 2 million people, after destroying the 
economies of all these states and everything that people 
painstakingly achieved over years, the value of which is 
estimated to tens of billions of dollars, they now realize they 
cannot live without us. 
  They have realized this even before, but they expected to 
achieve their domination with force, arms, and the sowing of 
fear. Along with the fear, they have sown hatred, distrust, and 
evil. Just as the force and all the weapons they have stolen 
from us failed to help them, just as they have not managed to 
frighten, conquer, or destroy us, they also failed to implant 
hatred or to force us to answer crime with crime. We are ready 
to build confidence among people and nations -- in fact, we have 
never given it up -- and we are going to build it. However, in 
doing so we must be careful, at least not to form a union with 
those people who initiated genocide and made a large part of 
Serbian people commit it, or at least not oppose it. We could 
even try with somebody else and somebody different. 
  In August 1992, there was an initiative for a confederation 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina with Croatia. Had a true military 
alliance between those states been established then, Serbian 
fascism would have already been defeated and the conditions 
created for establishing confidence among peoples and states, 
and even for establishing the principles of a possible 
confederal agreement. However, somebody who has several times 
already saved Milosevic's fascism from a complete defeat, as 
Tudjman has done, deserves equal suspicion, and his initiatives 
also.

  [Text] Bratunac, Jan 13 (TANJUG) -- The Moslems Thursday 
[13 January] fired on Serb positions from the Jusuf Dzonlic 
barracks in Sarajevo which also house some of the UN 
peacekeepers, in an obviously attempt to have the Serbs blamed 
for an attack on UNPROFOR if they answer back, Serb military 
sources report. 
  All Serb suburbs and Serb positions in the Sarajevo area 
were 
shelled by Moslems, the same sources state. Moslem forces in 
the region of the Moslem enclave Gorazde (eastern Bosnia) 
continue provocations with anti-aircraft and infantry weapons in 
the direction of the Serb positions, mainly in the direction of 
Foca. 
  Moslem artillery also shelled Serb positions and civilian 
targets in the region of Doboj (north Bosnia) in the region of 
Srbobran and Gradacac (central Bosnia) on the Bihac-Krupa line 
(northern Bosnia), and around Kladanj and Olovo (central 
Bosnia). In the four-day clashes near Olovo the Serb forces 
Thursday afternoon succeeded in repulsing the Moslem forces who 
were heading towards the town itself.

  [Text] Sarajevo's state hospital was today hit by three 
120-mm artillery projectiles for the fourth time this year. A 
letter from Bosnia-Herzegovina Defense Minister Hamdija 
Hadzihasanovic to General Briquemont, commander in chief of the 
UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] for Bosnia-Herzegovina, says 
five people staying in the hospital were seriously wounded and 
one was killed in the immediate vicinity of the hospital. Given 
the 500 direct artillery hits in 1992 and the 15 in 1993, it 
seems, if the current rate of shelling is anything to go by, 
that this year's shelling will exceed the level achieved in the 
first year of war. 
  Mr. General, you know well that the state hospital in 
Sarajevo is a civilian facility and you are also aware of its 
importance. This is why we lodge once again our sharpest 
protest over this crime by the Serbian aggressor, which you are 
quietly observing and logging. The Bosnia-Herzegovina defense 
minister ends his letter by saying: I call on you to react to 
such attacks in an adequate manner.

  [Text] Belgrade, Jan 13 (TANJUG) -- Representatives of the 
UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Sarajevo reported 
Thursday [13 January] that forces of the Bosnian Croat army HVO, 
have for the past two days been holding up a humanitarian convoy 
bringing aid to Bosnian Moslems in Maglaj, northern Bosnia. 
  They reported, according to AFP, that the column of nine 
trucks with food and medicine is blocked in Novi Seher, 10 
kilometers from Maglaj, and that the UN representative Larry 
Hollingworth is negotiating its passage with the local HVO 
commanders. They also said that the Bosnian Serb forces allowed 
the convoy to pass through their territory without any problems. 
UNHCR representatives in Sarajevo also warned about the 
extremely difficult position of the 40,000 civilians in Maglaj 
since the last convoy arrived there on October 25 last year.

<F P=106> [Report by Salih Brkic from Tuzla] </F>
  [Text] Dramatic appeals have been sent from Tuzla to Split 
and other seats of the UNHCR organization, to improve, finally, 
the quality of aid for people and refugees accomodated in Tuzla. 
The UNHCR working meeting is taking place in Split. The 
letters sent by Izet Hadzic, Tuzla District governor, Prof. Dr. 
(Sean) Avdic, government official in charge of aid to the people 
of northeastern Bosnia, and Tuzla Mayor Selim Beslagic, 
specifically point to the possibility of a tragedy befalling the 
population in the Tuzla District. The top officials of the 
Tuzla District and Commune are asking the UNHCR whether 632,000 
people, including 236,000 refugees and approximately the same 
number of social cases, can survive January with the 1,345 
tonnes of food that is to be brought to the large free territory 
of Tuzla District in the form of humanitarian aid. 
  Can one survive January with 3.26 kg of food including 2.5 
kg 
of flour? And there is only one in three chances of that 
happening, people from Tuzla say. 
  The UNHCR has recorded several cases of starvation in Tuzla 
District, as well as dozens of suicides as a consequence of 
mental derangement, exhaustion, poverty, and hunger. 
  All this has prompted representatives of the 14 communes of 
the region of northeastern Bosnia to decide jointly to refuse 
the plan offered by the UNHCR, and to propose to the war 
presidencies of their respective communes that humanitarian aid 
be refused as of 18 January if the UNHCR fails to consider the 
possibility of increasing humanitarian aid to Tuzla District. 
  At the same time, the peaceful protests, thus far, of 
refugees in front of the UNHCR (?agency) are more noticeable. 
According to district and communal authorities, the situation 
is being kept under control despite all the ordeals to which the 
population is exposed. 
  In his letter, Tuzla Mayor Selim Beslagic also says that 
convoys are not arriving in Tuzla District this month; soup 
kitchens and refugee hostels have food for only five more days, 
hospitals and orphanages for only two more days. 
  All of this signifies yet more political pressure on the 
Bosnian delegation on the eve the continuation of Geneva talks; 
we therefore demand that a decision on unrestrained movement of 
humanitarian convoys toward Tuzla be made, along with the 
establishment of UN entities that would guarantee the security 
of the convoys, state the Tuzla authorities.

  [Text] Olovo, Nisici, 13 Jan (TANJUG) -- Following 
unprecedented four-day fighting, members of the Combined Brigade 
of the Herzegovina Corps this morning managed to pierce Muslim 
defense lines in several parts of the Olovo battlefield [50 km 
north of Sarajevo on Sarajevo-Tuzla road], the brigade command 
has announced. Some Muslim units have been cut off following an 
unstoppable advance by Serb infantry and tank forces, and they 
are currently surrounded. These units keep asking for help from 
Tuzla which has not arrived because of severed communications. 
A large number of Muslim soldiers are leaving the battlefield 
in panic fleeing toward Olovo. The Muslim population from 
Krusevo and other villages near Olovo is already fleeing toward 
Tuzla. 
  The Muslim defeat can neither be helped by three rows of 
bunkers deeply dug in and covered by planks and earth by which 
Olovo and neighboring villages are surrounded. In the bloody 
four-day conflicts near Olovo, four members of the Combined 
Brigade of the Herzegovina Corps have been killed, while a few 
fighters have been wounded, three of them seriously. In the 
fighting today, up to the time when this dispatch was sent, the 
Serb side had not suffered any losses.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Colonel General Ante Roso, commander </F>
of the Croatian Defense Council, HVO, by unidentified 
correspondent in Siroki Brijeg; from the "Picture vs. Picture" 
program--live] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Dear viewers, it is my pleasure 
to welcome for the first time this evening our guest on the 
"Picture vs. Picture" program, Mr. Ante Roso, commander of the 
Croatian Defense Council, who is in the studio in Siroki Brijeg. 
Good evening, General Roso. 
  [Roso] Good evening, Madam. 
  [Correspondent] Welcome to "Picture vs. Picture." 
  [Roso] Thank you. 
  [Correspondent] If I am not mistaken, this is your first 
public appearance since you became HVO commander two months ago. 
Why have you waited so long? 
  [Roso] I was rather busy. 
  [Correspondent] General, you had a meeting yesterday with 
Gen. Rasim Delic, commander of the Bosnia-Herzegovina forces, in 
order to agree upon the modalities of the cease-fire that should 
come into effect on 15 January. All that is in line with the 
Bonn agreement between Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic. What 
specifically did you agree on? 
  [Roso] It seems to me that many things have been interpreted 
wrongly. We have not agreed on anything. We are waiting for 
basic political documents, that is, certain specific political 
guidelines. Consequently, we only agreed that we can proceed to 
establish specific modalities of the cease-fire. Nothing else 
was agreed upon, and nothing was signed. 
  [Correspondent] President Izetbegovic indicated yesterday 
that he would not accept the Croatian president's proposal. 
Will that have an impact? What impact will it have on further 
cease-fire agreements? 
  [Roso] You see, as long as we are talking about the 
political 
behavior of the Muslim side, it is unpredictable. This means 
that I am not a prophet, and I cannot tell you exactly whether 
or not there will be a cease-fire, whether or not we will 
achieve anything because there is nothing concrete. We have 
nothing concrete on which to base our statements as to what is 
really going on for the public, or even for the Army and 
everyone else. It is very difficult to interpret such behavior. 
  [Correspondent] If I am not wrong, you had a meeting with 
Gen. Delic in Visoko on 17 December last year, and you agreed on 
a cease-fire that was to last from 23 December to 3 January. It 
was exactly then that the Muslims launched a fierce offensive on 
the Lasva valley. Can you comment on this and describe the 
situation now? 
  [Roso] You see, we only talked about things in Visoko last 
time. Nothing was signed, and there was no official document. 
All we asked for was to spend the Christmas and New Year 
holidays in peace. As you know yourself, that verbal agreement 
was not honored, and we drew specific conclusions from such 
behavior. We heightened combat readiness, and the HVO was then 
ready to respond to any attack or surprise. We waited for the 
holidays and New Year in a state of readiness. 
  [Correspondent] What is the situation like now? Where is the 
fiercest fighting taking place? 
  [Roso] The situation now is relatively complex. Fighting is 
going on more or less everywhere--mainly in central 
Bosnia--where the intensity of armed clashes has reached a 
climax that could turn into a larger-scale escalation. More 
precisely, when I returned from Sarajevo yesterday, the Muslim 
army was continuing its offensive in the Vitez area from three 
directions, as well as against Novi Travnik. Thank God, all the 
attacks have been repelled, and the Croat nation, as well as the 
army, has retained its positions, . 
  [Correspondent] General, some newspapers in Croatia are 
speculating about the fall of Vitez, the withdrawal of the HVO 
forces, and a possible fall of the arms factory in Vitez into 
the Muslims' hands. Is that possible? 
  [Roso] You see, talking about the fall of Vitez, I would 
like 
to tell those eggheads that they are a bit abstract. That is 
out of the question as long as we are alive here, and as long as 
there are Croats in central Bosnia. This is not only my own 
stubbornness, or my own determination, but the will of the 
people whom I have seen recently. I even had the honor to meet 
some of them. It is out of the question that a part of Croat 
territory where the Croats in central Bosnia live should be 
brought into question at all and at any moment. We will surely 
not only fight, but also keep control of the territory. 
  Concerning Vitez itself and the industrial plant, I 
personally issued a written order that the explosives factory in 
Vitez be destroyed if necessary, regardless of the consequences. 
Of course, we will take care of the people and so on, and 
provide maximal safety during such an operation. It is 
certain, however, that we will hand over the factory in one 
piece to no one other than the Croatian Defense Council. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Tell us, what is the role of UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] in Bosnia-Herzegovina? To what degree are 
they impartial? 
  [Roso] You see, I personally believe that in such a complex 
environment as Bosnia-Herzegovina, ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina, is in, 
it is very difficult to treat everyone in a fair way. I 
perfectly understand that side. I think that UNPROFOR's 
neutrality is questionable. The contacts between the HVO and 
UNPROFOR are relatively fair. We honor what we have pledged to 
honor, which is the free passage of humanitarian convoys and 
certain relations of a more or less technical and military 
nature. We have had no other relations with them. 
  [Correspondent] There has been talk recently that the blue 
helmets could withdraw from Bosnia-Herzegovina. From the 
military point of view, what would happen if they did withdraw? 
  [Roso] In my opinion, if the UN forces withdraw from the 
territory that they are occupying now, nothing special would 
happen. That is my personal opinion. I am more than convinced 
that this is nothing spectacular, but simply a way of exerting 
pressure on all three sides. 
  I believe that it is not difficult to predict what would 
happen in the field if they withdrew. 
  [Correspondent] What, in your opinion, is the likelihood of 
NATO's military intervention? 
  [Roso] I think that is fiction. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Then, of course, the questions arise: How 
satisfied are you with the situation within the HVO ranks? Are 
there any groups which are evading your control? What kind of 
situation did you find when you took up your post, and what is 
it like now? 
  [Roso] You see, I usually say: an event is not a process; 
the 
situation is as it is; we cannot create everything at the same 
time and have a perfectly formed, elite army in legal and 
military terms. The army is being formed gradually; it is the 
reality of the people in this small area, the people who 
displayed more than just courage, who had to sacrifice a lot for 
this reality and freedom, and who are continuing to make 
sacrifices in a chivalrous and brave manner. 
  We are undergoing an administrative and legal reorganization 
of the armed forces on this part of Croatian territory. The 
HVO, like any other army, is embarking on its restructuring. 
The role of the commander, it seems to me, does not mean all 
that much. He only partially plays the role of an intermediary, 
while the army as a whole, as a culture, as a defense, is a 
whole process. It does not depend only on me, or on my 
successor or predecessor. The creation of the armed forces in 
the Croat Republic of Herceg-Bosna will take time, but it is an 
interesting period in the history of this people. 
  [Correspondent] Of course, journalists [words indistinct] 
that we lack information. But the fact is that there seems to 
have been some kind of information block recently, because, 
prior to Krizeljcevo Selo, the world was only concerned about 
the suffering of the Muslims but not of the Croats. What do you 
think about that? 
  [Roso] It is very simple. Justice can have a bad roll. 
Everybody seeks it, but nobody really wants it. It appears when 
someone needs it. These are certainly orchestrated topics with 
set scenarios, and that should not bother us too much. We had 
great difficulty in breaking the information blockade as regards 
the Croats, as always. We have too much experience with such 
things. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] I must not forget to ask you: What is 
happening with the HVO members in Sarajevo? 
  [Roso] The HVO members in Sarajevo have been disarmed and 
they are no longer -- for the time being -- an active official 
part of the HVO. You yourself know that there are several 
versions of events, but there is one realistic -- that they are 
completely disarmed and deprived of their rights as regards the 
Croatian national, ethnic body of the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna. 
  [Correspondent] What is the likelihood -- in your opinion 
and 
based on your experince so far -- of re-establishing a military 
alliance between the Croats and the Muslims? 
  [Roso] This is a complex question. I think that no Croat 
today can give you a definitive answer. But everything is 
possible in human life and in the life of a country. For 
example, France and Germany were at war for centuries and today, 
as far as I know, they are relatively close allies. 
  I think that the time is not yet ripe to talk about an 
alliance. But we can talk about certain relations, at least 
human relations. We have to communicate, we have to live, we 
have to keep going further as a human community because others 
are observing us. Consequently, we will treat the Muslims as we 
would any other people. 
  [Correspondent] You are a soldier with truly rich military 
experience. From the military viewpoint, how do you anticipate 
developments and the military balance in the next few months? 
  [Roso] I think that the problem in Bosnia, particularly, and 
in Herzegovina, has to be taken very seriously for several 
reasons. One reason is that this is a question of the survival 
of our people, of the Croatian people, on its legal, historic, 
ethnic territory. We cannot raise any obstruction to this, 
apart from reality. [sentence as heard] We have to survive 
there. There is no Bosnia without the Croats. Everybody must 
understand this, and this must be completely clear to everyone. 
  [Correspondent] But the front is very large. Excuse me, will 
this be possible without the intervention of the military forces 
of the Republic of Croatia. 
  [Roso] We do not need the Croatian Army. I deeply respect 
it, but we have enough people and technical equipment and we 
know how to use it. We have technologically mastered the use of 
certain materials. We have certainly introduced some up-to-date 
military technology, some new types of equipment, and if 
necessary we will use it. I think that we have not yet reached 
that option, but I can guarantee this before God: We will use 
anything to preserve the Croatian people's territory in 
Herceg-Bosna.

  [Text] The concessions that we have made so far, we made 
thinking that they were the price of peace. If it turns out 
that the Muslim and the Croatian sides indeed do not want peace, 
we are prepared to make a different, radical step. We could 
retracted the concessions. We are prepared for a solution that 
would lead to the end of the Bosnian crisis, either through war 
or peace. 
  This was stated for our paper by Nikola Koljevic, vice 
president of the republic of Srpska, commenting on the 
assembly's decision to postpone the adoption of the platform 
until its session in Bijeljina on 17 January, shortly before the 
meeting in Geneva. Stressing that the deputies at the Pale 
assembly session adhered to their earlier offer [33.3 percent of 
the territory for the Muslims], Dr. Koljevic said that the final 
platform was not adopted this time because of "a possibility of 
the Muslims and Croats reaching a new agreement." 
  "We certainly want the final settlement of the Bosnian 
crisis 
to be achieved peacefully, and we paid too high a price for 
peace, and yet it has not been established yet," Koljevic said. 
"This is thanks to the others, primarily to the Muslims. Serbs 
cannot be asked to do anything more, because while we were 
making certain concessions, new concessions were demanded, and 
the concessions that had been made earlier were quickly 
forgotten. These unjust concessions should finally be stopped." 
  Asked to comment on the latest threats to Serbs with 
military 
force, Dr., Koljevic said: 
  "Serbs have had enough of threats. Many responsible people 
are thinking incorrectly because they do not know Serbs, their 
history, and aspirations."

<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnia-Herzegovina Defense Minister Hamdo </F>
Hadzihasanovic by Gordana Knezevic and Rasim Cerimagic; place 
and date not given: "We Have the Strength for a Just Peace"] 
  [Text] "There have been a lot of rumors about the kind of 
state we are creating. One of the reasons for this war is that 
we will no longer let others determine what our state will be 
like. It will be as our soldiers dream it should be -- 
democratic -- and all its citizens will live a dignified life. 
Whether a person is a Bosniak-Muslim, a Serb, a Croat, a 
Gypsy... and a person's religious and political affiliation will 
be a private matter. This will be a free country in which 
foreigners will also be able to come, make investments and stay. 
I would like to see the Japanese, Indonesians, Swedes, Dutch, 
Iranians... and all other people of good will settle here," said 
Hamdo Hadzihasanovic, defense minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in 
an interview for OSLOBODJENJE. 
  [OSLOBODJENJE] For a year this country did not have a 
defense minister. That speaks not only of the force of the 
aggression from outside but also of internal blockades and 
treason in order to thwart the defense of Bosnia. 
  [Hadzihasanovic] Let me remind you that, in the stage of 
preparing for the realization of the long-planned aggression, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina was effectively deprived of a leader. All 
those who understood what was going on here were, in various 
ways, rendered powerless and eliminated from political life. 
Immediately before the aggression, the entire leadership of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina was destroyed through the "Agrokomerc" 
affair, and then also through Neum. For a long time we had many 
illusions and we still have some today. First of all, every one 
of us must defend the integrity of his or her own person and 
preserve his or her sanity. We must not allow our hate to 
influence our decisionmaking. It is crucial, for strengthening 
our defense, to rid ourselves of many illusions. First, was it 
possible to avoid the war? Yes, if we had surrendered. The 
process of our destruction would be milder and slower, but we 
would definitely be destroyed. 
  Second, are national parties responsible for the war? I am 
not a member of any party, but I claim they are not. The 
aggression was conceived before those parties were created, and 
they are just one of the means for making war. 
  Third, will there be an intervention and will they lift the 
arms embargo? There will not be a military intervention. We 
will have to do everything on our own. The embargo will get 
weaker as we get stronger. The embargo is like a drug: you 
become addicted, you must have weapons, but since they are 
forbidden and not everyone can sell them -- they are very 
expensive. 
  Fourth, is there a war against the Bosniaks-Muslims and 
against Islam? Yes, this is also a crusade. But I do not want 
to emphasize that dimension, for that would only stimulate 
fascism, even in our own midst. 
  This is an imperialistic war for "greater Serbia." How else 
can we explain the killing of the Slovenes, Croats, the exile of 
the Hungarians...? After the aggression, according to the 
theory of closed systems, disintegration was increased here, to 
simplify -- disorder and every conflict, from piling up garbage 
to criminal reprisals between the Croats and the Muslims, and 
among brothers. Those who need that created evidence that this 
is a religious and civil war. 
  However, I am sure that there is a Ram ["framework" -- 
Belgrade plan to arm the Bosnian Serbs] for Milosevic's "ram." 
I think that the United States has a Ram both for Serbia, 
Russia, and Europe. Milosevic's chetniks have gone mad and are 
killing us, but as soon as they come to their senses, they will 
kill him too. Therefore, we must dispel our illusions, but that 
will not be painless. The fact that this country was, for so 
long, without a defense minister, is also a consequence of 
illusions. However, all the while, the deputy minister and his 
associates were working. People worked as much as they could in 
the circumstances. It is not up to me to evaluate their work. 
I look ahead and do everything to move forward. 

<H5>    Stronger by the Day </H5>
  [OSLOBODJENJE] The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army was formed and 
became stronger in dramatic circumstances when they were 
defending their lives. Would you comment on its organization 
and strength today, almost two year after the aggression? 
  [Hadzihasanovic] The army, Ministry of the Interior, and 
other components of Bosnia-Herzegovina armed forces, were formed 
and became stronger in the most dramatic circumstances known to 
history. Wise and brave individuals and groups ("Patriotic 
Alliance," "Green Berets," and others) saw through the 
aggressor's intentions and offered organized resistance. 
Wherever there was organized resistance, the aggressor did not 
realize its intentions. This is a valuable experience and 
provides the foundation for the development of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. 
  Today it is a great force. Educated, experienced, and with 
disciplined officers, a command headquarters and units. New 
officers are being educated as they fight. We have young 
soldiers coming to us. They use modern, sophisticated computer 
technology. The world, lead by the United States and West 
Europe, is afraid of the former Yugoslav National Army, and our 
army, whose hands are tied by the arms embargo, counters that 
force on its own and is successful in destroying it. It is high 
time we told the world that, although they interfere with us, we 
are helping them to destroy the fascist monster with the flesh 
and blood of our most outstanding sons.... 
  [OSLOBODJENJE] Of course, demilitarization will soon make no 
sense? 
  [Hadzihasanovic] One of the illusions imposed on us that I 
failed to mention in answer to your first question is 
demilitarization. Is there anything more stupid and lethal than 
saying to our only real defense force, to the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Army, in the middle of the war, that we will disband it as soon 
as we sign an agreement on peace. Fortunately, we have not 
dispelled that illusion. There will be no demilitarization as 
long as Serbia and Croatia have weapons. 
  That was just another deceit from the arsenal of special 
war, 
which was supposed to shake our faith in our own strength. The 
public often say that our soldiers are confused, that our goals 
are not clear, that the Platform of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Presidency has been surpassed.... I do not think that is true. 
Our soldiers know they are fighting for freedom and justice for 
their people and for a STRONG BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA. We learned 
that, just as an illness attacks a body when its immune system 
is weakened, a war attacks a country when it gets weak, when its 
leadership is incomplete, and when its people are naive. 
<H5>  Prepared for the Worst </H5>
  [OSLOBODJENJE] In the field, there are some individuals and 
groups that are not under a banner of Bosnia-Herzegovina, under 
the insignia and command of the army. 
  [Hadzihasanovic] We will energetically finish the process we 
began. They will either be placed under command of the army or 
they will be disarmed. Further development of our armed forces 
is based on a determinant that foresees the simultaneous 
occurrence of the worst possible factors for us: joint 
aggressors, withdrawal of the UNHCR [United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees] and UNPROFOR [United Nations 
Protection Forces], the embargo, and the winter. We benefit when 
any of those factors are missing. 
  All our soldiers know that the war will not end until we 
provide a minimum area for our survival and development. Until, 
in addition to access to the Sava, we establish a territorial 
link with eastern Bosnia, until we retrieve our territory in 
western Bosnia in which the Bosniak-Muslims form the majority, 
and until we gain access to the part of our coast at Neum -- 
there will be no peace. If the aggressors do not sign to verify 
our intentions, we will have to use force to push them to those 
borders. Use only our force. 
  [OSLOBODJENJE] How do the government and your ministry 
intend to solve the problem of finances and logistic support to 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army? 
  [Hadzihasanovic] The government and the Ministry of Defense 
are realizing many projects that will upgrade the system of 
financing, equipping, and supplying the armed forces. All 
sources of financing and goods are gradually being placed in the 
function of the state and defense. All republic funds have been 
abolished. The government finances the armed forces through the 
Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Finance. The flow of 
information, money, and goods for corps and districts are 
clearly defined. We have recently issued instructions 
regulating that matter. We have also activated the inspectorate 
of the Ministry of Defense. Financing the armed forces from 
local sources must be abolished as soon as possible. That means 
we must do away with self-proclaimed home guard units and, at 
the same time, leave less room for autonomism. There are still 
some hidden stocks of goods. Our primary goal is to introduce 
stimulative measures to make businessmen sell those goods and 
start ordering and producing more goods. But we will also 
combine that with some repressive measures. All firms and other 
legal persons who will not accept concrete specifications for 
the scope and deadline of deliveries of goods, or who do not 
meet contractual obligations, will be shut down. At the same 
time, we are carrying out a revision of formations in army 
units. By activating businessmen we will create conditions for 
reducing the number of logistics personnel, and especially for 
those who pretend to be that. By increasing production we will 
also stimulate money transactions, reduce municipality borders 
(customs duty), cut prices, destroy the black market, and 
eliminate criminals and the mafia, both domestic and 
international, often hiding behind humanitarian missions. Those 
are the prerequisites for breaking the chetnik and ustasha 
encirclements once and for all. 
  Until we upgrade money transfers, the families of dead 
Muslim 
heroes, soldiers and fighters, instead of worthless salaries, 
will get basic food products, firewood....

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Bosnia-Herzegovina Foreign </F>
Minister Irfan Ljubljankic with unidentified ETTELA'AT 
correspondent in Tehran; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [ETTELA'AT] How long will 
the Muslim officials of Bosnia-Herzegovina continue to stand up 
to the Serbs to recover 2 to 4 percent of their territory? 
  [Ljubljankic] We still demand the return of our occupied 
territory, in which massacres and ethnic hostilities continue. 
In fact, this is the demand of our parliament and we cannot 
concede it. On the basis of the Geneva conference and the peace 
proposals presented therein, the return of four percent of our 
territory to the Muslim areas is to ensure our interests and we 
cannot abandon it. 
  [ETTELA'AT] How do you view the Bihac adventurists in view 
of the situation currently prevailing in Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Ljubljankic] Fikret Edic is a die-hard communist who has 
never defended Muslim interests. He is colluding with Bosnia's 
neighbors -- the Serbs and Croats -- to undermine the stamina of 
the Muslims at a time when Bosnia-Herzegovina is gasping in the 
throes of a life and death struggle. 
  Edic has reaped much profit in this manner, which he is now 
spending on catering to the needs of the rebels. This is an act 
of treason to the motherland and he is a traitor in our eyes. 
The Bosnian army is successfully defending Western Bosnia 
against the Serbs and the forces of the traitor Edic in most 
difficult conditions and we are trying to approach Edic's 
command base in Valica Klarosa [name as transliterated]. 
  [ETTELA'AT] What is your assessment of the future of Bosnia- 
Herzegovina in the event of the division of the country into 
three ethnic parts? Will peace return to Bosnia-Herzegovina if 
such a partition takes place? 
  [Ljubljankic] Bosnia-Herzegovina has always been considered 
a culturally diverse society with much variety among the various 
minorities. Then, a century ago we saw the end of five 
centuries of Ottoman rule, which had been able to insure 
tolerance and coexistence among the religions. At present we 
are in a situation in which we are forced to be realistic. 
There may be ethnic divisions, but that concept will not bring 
peace. 
  The basic condition of peace -- that is, justice -- has not 
been taken into consideration. 
  [ETTELA'AT] What is the best way of providing assistance to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in view of the arms embargo against your 
country? 
  [Ljubljankic] There is no other way to assist 
Bosnia-Herzegovina at this moment. The best way would be to 
provide financial assistance so that the country can strengthen 
its economy and purchase weapons. 
  [ETTELA'AT] What effect do the practical and theoretical 
stances of the Islamic countries, including that of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, have on the enemies' aggression? What are 
Bosnia-Herzegovina's expectations of the world's countries and 
how do you feel these are being met? 
  [Ljubljankic] The Islamic countries are all endowed with 
growing economic power. We expect them to use this economic 
power to exert pressure on the Western countries so that the 
arms embargo imposed on us will be lifted. In every city of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, there are churches alongside the mosques. 
Unfortunately because of the fascist ideas of ethnic cleansing, 
all the mosques in the cities under Serb and Croat occupation 
have been destroyed. 
  The idea of dividing the country into ethnic regions is a 
new 
concept that never existed before in our country. We would 
prefer that Bosnia-Herzegovina retain its unique heritage in the 
world; this is quite a practical concept. [passage omitted] 
  If the arms embargo is lifted, we can solve our problems 
quickly. Even if this does not happen, politico-economic 
pressure would help boost the Muslims' stance at the peace talks. 
  [ETTELA'AT] The recent talks in Geneva and Brussels are the 
latest efforts to end the Bosnian crisis. In your opinion, will 
these be successful? 
  [Ljubljankic] The Geneva and Brussels talks give the 
European Union an opportunity to prove that those countries are 
sincere in doing something for Bosnia-Herzegovina on the 
political level. Unfortunately, the European countries are not 
able to motivate the Serbs to grant even a few concessions. 
Europe lacks the necessary ability and instruments to get these 
concessions; this is due to the absence of the political 
determination to use all necessary force. 
  The talks are not successful at present; they merely 
motivate 
the Serbs to perpetrate greater atrocities, so that the cities 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina are being shelled and civilians killed. 
  [ETTELA'AT] What is your opinion of the possibility of the 
Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] participating in the peace 
talks that are being held in Europe? 
  [Ljubljankic] This proposal, which was presented by the 
other sided at the peace talks, will not be accepted within the 
framework of the current talks. 
  Perhaps in the new talks this could get more consideration 
for Bosnia-Herzegovina, a totally new round of talks that should 
be based on documents by the United Nations and the CSCE. The 
ICO should influence the talks by using its political and 
economic power as leverage.

Jeddah bureaus: "Bosnians Defeat Croats in Vitez on Eve of 
Begovic-Tudjman Talks"] 
  [Excerpts] Radio Zagreb has acknowledged that units of the 
Bosnian army succeeded at dawn yesterday, Sunday, in breaking 
through Croatian defense lines around the city of Vitez. They 
were able to gain control of the northeastern entry to the city. 
It added that the Muslims were able to cut the road linking 
Vitez and Busavaca, which is now completely besieged by the 
Muslims. [passage omitted]

  Croatian army sources have said that the broad Muslim 
offensive included Zepce, Busovaca, and Kiseljak, and that the 
Muslims had sent for a large number of their soldiers from the 
city of Zenta. It added that the British unit serving with the 
international forces had undertaken patrols on the road between 
Vitez and Busovaca to save refugees who had been forced to flee 
these areas. 
  AL-HAYAH escorted the first phase of this attack, in which 
the Muslims succeeded in placing the siege around Vitez and 
reaching its suburbs. 
  AL-HAYAH has learned from a military source that Bosnian 
President Alija Izetbegovic met for five hours the day before 
yesterday with the commanders of the Bosnian army in the Konic 
region, and that the chief of staff, interior minister, and most 
senior military leaders took part in the meeting.

  [Editorial Report] The 4 January edition of the Split daily 
SLOBODNA DALMAC1JA in Serbo-Croatian publishes on page 3 a map 
the paper says was drafted by the Bosnian Army. The paper 
reports that the map, disclosing an offensive plan of the 
Bosnian Army, was obtained by Croatian Defense Council (HVO) 
"intelligence circles." Based on the map, SLOBODNA DALMAC1JA 
states, "it is obvious that the Muslim leadership of Sarajevo 
headed by Alija Izetbegovic has decided to destroy and expel the 
Croats from the Lasva Valley in central Bosnia," after which the 
Muslim forces would push through the Neretva Valley to the sea 
near Neum. The paper states that in order to carry out this 
plan, scheduled to begin on 3 January, the Muslims have 
concentrated in central Bosnia almost every corps of the Bosnian 
Army. The 303d Mountain Brigade of the 3rd Corps has been tasked 
with the first attack, directed against Vitez, SLOBODNA 
DALMACIJA states, adding that 5,000 soldiers of the 1st Corps 
from Sarajevo have already been sent toward Kiseljak, after 
which attacks on other Croatian enclaves are planned.

<F P=106> [Article by As'ad Taha in Fojnica: "Muslims Prepare for Long </F>
War and Self-Reliance"] 
  [Excerpt] The first impression that any visitor to central 
Bosnia takes away with him is that the Muslims are preparing 
themselves for a long-term war of liberation, in which they are 
relying on their own resources. They have despaired of a Western 
or international position that might have enabled them to 
recover their territories, or given them the right to 
self-defense by lifting the arms embargo. 
  Despite the fact that everyone thinks of Sarajevo when 
speaking of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the central region 
is considered the heart of the Bosnian state, its principal 
nerve, and the center of the Muslim republic, after partition, 
for it has natural resources and strategic sites controlling the 
roads linking the parts of the country. 
  It was in this very region that Bosnian President Alija 
Izetbegovic enjoys popularity that goes beyond his position as 
the symbol of the Bosnian Muslims in a unique historical period 
for them, during which they escaped the knives of the Serbs and 
Croats. Pictures of him have replaced those of former Yugoslav 
leader Josip Tito, who just a few months ago still presided over 
government offices and official institutions, with poems and 
popular songs praising and singing about him. 
  The speech he gave during his tour through this region a few 
weeks ago was accorded great importance by the man in the 
street--in it, he promised that the Bosnian army would soon move 
from a defense phase to a liberation phase--especially as it 
coincided with news, spread unofficially and unannounced, about 
the achievement of military progress on the military fronts with 
both the Croats and the Serbs. 
  For example, a week never passes without military units of 
the Bosnian army succeeding in pushing back the Croatian 
militias, which seem to be suffering from poor conditions, 
especially in the regions of Kiseljuk, Busovaca, and Vitez, 
whose city center has now become visible. 
  In recent weeks, Bosnian fighters have made considerable 
progress around the capital, acknowledged by the official 
spokesman of the international forces in Sarajevo, though it has 
not been announced in its official media. Last week, the Serbs 
began a huge military campaign on several fronts, and met with 
devastating failure. 
  According to information AL-HAYAH obtained, there is a new 
attempt to break the siege around the capital, planned for a day 
and night some months ago, but awaiting the right moment for its 
implementation. 
  The arms and ammunition crisis is no longer the Bosnian 
army's worst problem; that is now the lack of the fuel necessary 
for aid and supply operations, which were halted after the 
outbreak of war between the Muslims and Croats. It had reached 
them through Croatian territory, causing them difficult 
problems, compelling Bosnian soldiers to march on foot from one 
point to another. 
  In spite of what the Muslims have suffered at Serbian and 
Croatian hands, there is a large sector of them who still 
believe that coexistence by the three communities is possible. 
There are still some Serbs and Croats who hold official posts, 
and sometimes high office, in these regions. Even so, Serb and 
Croat citizens living there are in no danger or threat of losing 
their jobs or homes, or of being rounded up as happened to 
Muslims in the regions occupied by Serbian or Croatian militias. 
  The trinity of war, hunger, and cold have imposed a high 
degree of social and economic solidarity on the Bosnian people, 
among individuals and whole cities. Basic goods and commodities 
are bartered; Sarajevo, for example, sends flour to the cities 
of the central region, which in turn send meat to Sarajevo. 
  Some negative social phenomena, such as stealing and moral 
corruption, have, however, begun to appear on the surface, 
though they are still less than in other parts of the world 
afflicted with this kind of war. 
  This vital region of the country has gone through a 
considerable period of self-sufficiency in terms of foodstuffs, 
repairing the effects of war imposed by the Serbian militias, 
and cutting aid routes using the Croatian militias. Some 
villages are in no need of food aid, which was coming 
sporadically from the [High] Commission for Refugees and 
international aid agencies. 
  According to the new redisticting that the Bosnian 
Government 
has organized, the district of Zenta has come to include 14 
municipalities in central Bosnia-Herzegovina, with a population 
of about 1 million, the overwhelming majority of whom are 
Muslims. They include six municipalities either totally or 
partially occupied by Serbian or Croatian militias. 
  Fuad Dzidic, recently appointed minister of this district by 
the Bosnian government as part of the system that divided the 
Muslims' areas into four (with a minister responsible for each), 
said, "We are proceeding with an ordered plan that we hope to 
complete to implement self-sufficiency, beginning with grains 
and vegetables." However, he thinks that the war going on in his 
region began before the Serbian and Croatian military invasion 
of it. "Iron and wood industries have been based in this region 
since the days of communist rule, plus coal and iron mines, 
causing a great deal of environmental pollution, which has 
negatively affected the volume of agricultural space in the 
region." He cited as an example a steel factory, the largest in 
former Yugoslavia, located in the center of the city of Zenica. 
It used to produce two million tons annually, without the use of 
any purifying filters. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Stanislaw Grzymski: "Olechowski and Pawlak Back </F>
From Prague; We Can Count on Help"--last paragraph attributed to 
P.K.] 
  [Text] "Poland is now more secure and closer to NATO," said 
Foreign Affair Minister Andrzej Olechowski at a press conference 
on Thursday [13 January] after having returned from Prague. 
  Commenting on the talks of the Visegrad Group leaders, the 
chief Polish diplomat based his view on the evolution that has 
occurred in the concept of the "Partnership for Peace" since it 
was first put forward by Bill Clinton. 
  Minister Olechowski believes that the U.S. "Partnership for 
Peace" initiative was enriched by the declaration that NATO will 
remain open to the states of Central Europe. 
  These states were assured that they can count on NATO's help 
in crises and that their security is closely related to the 
security of NATO. "Partnership for Peace" will also incorporate 
Ukraine and Russia into the international security system. 
  Minister Olechowski claims that "Partnership for Peace" will 
enhance Poland's defense capabilities. The proposed program of 
military cooperation with NATO will lead to 
"interoperationalness" of the armies of NATO and of the states 
of Central Europe. In line with this program, Poland will have 
access to NATO technology and information, as well as to Western 
early-warning systems. Poland will also have the right to hold 
consultations with the 16 member states of NATO if its 
sovereignty is jeopardized, and the possibility of establishing 
joint units with them. 
  While commenting on the talks in Prague, Prime Minister 
Waldemar Pawlak said that, aside from the "Partnership for 
Peace," which offers Poland "political prospects and prospects 
of security," we also need a "partnership for development." He 
stressed that "economic stability is one of the most important 
security factors." 
  Prime Minister Pawlak stated that the leaders of the Czech 
Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia agreed on the need to extend the 
political platform of the Visegrad Group to the economic 
platform and to establish a formula of "G-4," similar to "G-7," 
the seven richest countries in the world. The Visegrad Group 
states will jointly resolve regional problems, intensify their 
economic cooperation, and create the appropriate infrastructure. 
It is expected that, in April of this year, the liberalization 
of trade within the framework of the Central European Free Trade 
Zone will be accelerated. 
  Asked whether the meeting of the presidents of the United 
States and the Visegrad Group states was a success, President 
Lech Walesa stressed upon his return from Prague that new 
concepts are being created that are headed in the right 
direction; however, the important thing is the rate of the 
transformations: "I take advantage of any good moment; there are 
also other strategists, who walk the assigned path step by 
step," said the president, emphasizing the role of the mass 
media, especially in the West, in explaining Poland's stand on 
this issue.

<F P=106> [Untitled Stanislaw Cwik commentary from the "Hundred Words" </F>
series] 
  [Text] The Prague summit has turned out to be a proper 
school of realistic thinking for the new Polish Government. We 
failed to achieve success there. We were firmly shown where our 
place lies and what we can expect from our contacts with the 
powers. And the most we can expect is sympathy. Strategic 
decisions about the demarcation of influence are going to be 
made without our direct participation. That is how things used 
to be, and that is how they remain. 
  This initial cold shower will be useful for the Pawlak 
government. It will enable the government to dispense with the 
"messianic" delusions of previous governments and might even 
help it establish a realistic program of cooperation with the 
West for the next four years, a program based on the strength of 
our exports and on military economic diplomacy, and capable of 
defending our industry and our commercial rights. Such a program 
has been called for by the coalition. 
  Prime Minister Pawlak seems to understand this. Instead of 
being seized with a fit of despair about the Prague summit and 
shedding tears over the flimsy condition of the Visegrad Group, 
he is seeking new paths of cooperation. On the other hand, 
President Walesa clearly cannot come to terms with reality and 
is not hiding his profound disappointment with the West. But let 
us hope he recovers quickly and draws practical conclusions from 
this successive harsh lesson.

  [Text] Warsaw, 14 Jan--On Friday morning, President Lech 
Walesa received Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky, who 
is on an official visit to Poland. 
  Welcoming the guest, the president said that it is important 
for Poland and Hungary to speak up on issues that are important 
for Europe because "others can do something for us and without 
us [as received]." 
  In Walesa's opinion, both countries should maintain working 
contacts "in the context" of the situation in Europe, "which 
determines our security and prosperity." Walesa said that the 
Partnership for Peace proposal can be a considerable partnership 
if "we decide about its shape ourselves." He added that the 
gifts are nice but do not always "suit our appetite." 
  Minister Jeszenszky stated that decisions made in Brussels 
and Prague "would not have been as significant without the work 
of Poland and the Polish president." He added that it is 
important to keep U.S. and West European politicians to their 
word and ensure that they fulfill their promises. "We have 
reasons to hope, but we also have reasons to be concerned," 
Jeszenszky said.

<F P=106> [Article by Eza Czaczkowska and Renata Wrobel: "Who Will </F>
Advise the Prime Minister?"] 
  [Text] Currently, two teams of advisers for the prime 
minister are being formed. The first team, a component of the 
Cabinet, will consist of permanent advisers who will advise the 
prime minister on ways of better organizing the work of state 
departments. The second team, the task of which is to draw 
conclusions and develop proposals for resolving various issues, 
will include experts representing different segments of society. 
The second team is headed by Franciszek Mleczke, under secretary 
of state at the Office of the Council of Ministers. In addition, 
the prime minister can seek advice from the Chief Executive 
Committee of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]. Concurrently, the 
prime minister is considering the issue of creating a council 
for public-economic issues within the Council of Ministers. 
Those who are responsible for the creation of these advising 
bodies are not revealing the names of the advisers to be, 
claiming that it is too early to disclose their identities. 
  Unofficial sources say that Bogdan Lukasiewicz, Henryk 
Sobierajski, and Slawomir Wozniak could be named as advisers to 
the prime minister. 
<H5>  Bogdan Lukasiewicz </H5>
  In the past, he was one of Pawlak's closest advisers. He is 
"loved" more by the PSL leadership than by ordinary party 
members. "He is used to settling things in high places," says 
one PSL member. Lukasiewicz (born in 1950) owns a big farm and 
is joint owner of a transport company cooperating with the Wansa 
company that attempted to import 220,000 sheep from the 
Caucasus. Minister of Agriculture Andrzej Smietanko made 
assurances that this deal was cut short. Until late December 
1993, Bogdan Lukasiewicz, along with the People's Economic 
Association, held a controlling interest in the Glospress 
company, which publishes the Lodz newspaper GLOS PORANNY. 
Beginning this January, the majority of shares of the indebted 
newspaper are being bought by the Galtex company, Social 
Democracy of the Polish Republic, and the PSL. 
  Beginning in 1973, Bogdan Lukasiewicz was a United Peasant 
Party [ZSL] member. Under the previous ZSL leadership, he 
performed the functions of the Chief Executive Committee 
treasurer. Currently, despite Pawlak's support, new Chief 
Council members have not elected him to the Chief Executive 
Committee. Mr. Lukasiewicz was a deputy in the 10th and the 
First Sejm; he ran for the Sejm in the last elections but lost 
in his Lodz electoral district--he was number 53 on the 
all-country electoral list and could not become a government 
member. During "Pawlak's 33 days," he participated in 
negotiations on the coalition and was one of the candidates for 
deputy prime minister for economic issues; during the last 
period of the formation of Pawlak's Cabinet, Mr. Lukasiewicz 
headed the group of PSL experts involved in talks. He helped 
Pawlak write his inaugural speech to the Sejm. Before the PSL 
won in the elections, he told ZYCIE WARSZAWY: "The PSL and the 
Democratic Left Alliance have enough members who have gone 
through a deputy political school and can become members of the 
Office of the Council of Ministers. With us, this institution 
would have worked perfectly. Our people would not be strangers 
there." Currently, he is a member of the PSL Chief Executive 
Council and controls primary peasant organizations. 
<H5>  Henryk Sobierajski </H5>
  He is responsible for contacts with the mass media. He is a 
well-known citizen of Lodz, a grandson of Hubala and son of 
Krystyna Sobierajska, who worked for the newspaper Lodz GLOS 
ROBOTNIZY (currently, GLOS PORANNY) all her life. 
  Henryk Sobierajski graduated from the Academy of Physical 
Culture, wrote for GLOS PORANNY and DZENNIK LODZKI, and later 
(until June 1993) ran the company that edited GLOS PORANNY. He 
is not a party member. However, people think that he sympathizes 
with the PSL and is friendly with Bogdan Lukasiewicz. He has 
never run in elections. 
<H5>  The Office That Plans Government Activities </H5>
  Under Hanna Suchocka, this office was headed by Tadeusz 
Syryjczyk and was an advisory body. All of its members except 
Slawomir Wozniak have been dismissed. Currently, Mr. Wozniak may 
become one of Pawlak's advisers. 
<H5>  Slawomir Wozniak </H5>
  He graduated from the Higher School of Engineering in Radom 
and earned his doctoral degree in economics at the Academy of 
Political Sciences. Mr. Wozniak worked at the "Lucznik" factory 
and, in the late 1980's, was assistant to State Council Deputy 
Chairman Tadeusz Witold Mlynczak (president of the Democratic 
Party). 
<H5>  Franciszek Mleczko </H5>
  He was born in 1931. His current duty is to organize the 
second team of advisers. He is a professor of social sciences 
dealing with social issues of village life, agriculture, and 
culture. He studied in Warsaw, Moscow, and Paris. Since 1968, he 
has lectured at Warsaw Agricultural Academy, Warsaw University, 
the Academy of Social Sciences within the Central Committee, and 
the High School of Social Sciences. He was a member of the 
Polish United Workers Party [PZPR] until it ceased to exist. 
Currently, he is not a party member. In the opinion of PSL 
members, he is still a PZPR supporter. He began to attend PSL 
meetings on Grzybowska street (PZPR headquarters) as early as at 
the beginning of the 1970's; he used to write for the quarterly 
WIES WSPOLCZESNA. From 1974 to 1978, he was deputy director of 
the Institute of Culture at the Ministry of Culture and Art and 
shared an office with Michal Strak. 
  Professor Franciszek Mleczko says that Prime Minister Pawlak 
charged him with the first task before the 1991 elections. He 
analyzed the situation in the Polish political scene and the 
PSL's chances of winning the elections. During the last 
elections, he was proposed as a possible PSL candidate, but he 
rejected the suggestion, claiming that he did not want to engage 
in politics. Mr. Mleczko states that he is looking for people 
who are not connected with any parties. 
<H5>  Wladyslaw Szymanski </H5>
  He is an exception. He is a member of a group of advisers, 
both in the Office of the Council of Ministers and the PSL Chief 
Executive Committee. Professor of Economics Wladyslaw Szymanski 
is respected in PSL circles. He was born in 1941. He is an 
author of the PSL economic program. He is lecturing at the Main 
School of Commerce and heads the Analysis of Markets and 
Competitiveness Committee. Mr. Szymanski has been connected with 
the people's movement since 1960: First, he participated in the 
Rural Youth Union; in 1963, he joined the ZSL; in 1977-80, he 
was adviser to Roman Malinowski; in 1980, he became a member of 
the ZSL Chief Executive Committee; and in 1985-89, he was a 
member of the State Council and a deputy in the Ninth Sejm. Like 
all of the other advisers, he cooperated with WIES WSPOLCZESNA 
(1974-77). PSL circles respect him for efficient economic 
analysis (some deputies say that his predictions are too 
"catastrophic"). However, some of his prognoses have never been 
realized. He is said to be modest and not a "career man." When 
Pawlak's government was being created, Mr. Szymanski's name was 
proposed for a ministerial post among the others. However, he 
rejected all of the proposals. He did not run for the Sejm, 
either. Some well-informed circles state that, after his work in 
the State Council, he began to hate social activities. 
<H5>  Jan Bisztyga and Other Advisers </H5>
  Deputy prime ministers are organizing their own groups of 
advisers (Secretary of State Andrzej Zor is responsible for this 
work in Mark Borowski's office; in Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz's 
office, this is being done by Under Secretary of State Grzegorz 
Rydlewski; in Aleksandr Luczak's office by Under Secretary of 
State Stanislaw Dobrzanski). Some ministers have also started 
creating their own groups of advisers. The nomination of Jan 
Bisztyga to the post of adviser for Michal Strak, chairman of 
the Office of Council of Ministers, was the most controversial 
over the past few weeks. Mr. Bisztyga was the last spokesman for 
the mass media within the PZPR Central Committee. He performed 
his duties from the spring of 1989 until the last day of the 
PZPR's existence. Being a PZPR spokesman, he first met with 
journalists in mid-April 1989. He wished to implement a "new 
information policy" of the PZPR, describing it as "opening doors 
to primary PZPR committees." Before the elections were held, he 
organized forums with journalists entitled "Only for Those Who 
Think" and reassured that main candidates of the 
government-coalition faction have victory "in their pockets." 
After the elections were held, he was the first to state in the 
PZPR Central Committee: "We have lost. We should give back 
power." In 1972-74, Mr. Bisztyga performed the functions of 
under secretary of state in the Foreign Ministry and was Polish 
ambassador to Greece and Great Britain. Officials of the Office 
of the Council of Ministers state that he will use his 
experience in his new post and aid Mr. Strak on international 
issues.

<F P=106> [Article by Piotr Adamowicz: "Changes Needed in the Budget"] </F>
  [Text] The authorities of "Solidarity" ["S"] have requested 
the government to make changes in the budget bill. They believe 
that the projected price increases will result in higher 
inflation and higher maintenance costs, as well as lower real 
incomes of employees. On 9 February, they will stage an 
all-national demonstration in Warsaw. 
  According to the National Committee [KK], the increases in 
the prices of energy and other goods of the so-called basic 
consumer basket scheduled for this year will bring about an 
increase in maintenance costs and a drop in employees' real 
incomes. Another factor that will limit these incomes will be 
higher tax rates. "S" fears that the policy of the present 
government will make it impossible to carry out the fundamental 
provision of the "Pact on Enterprise," which pertains to an 
increase in real wages in the production sphere in a situation 
of a projected increase in the GDP. "I always knew that the 
present governing group does not meet our political 
expectations; the budget bill proved that it does not meet our 
social expectations, either," stated "S" Chairman Marian 
Krzaklewski. 
  Most of the KK members support the idea of organizing 
protests. The differences were only over the timing and the form 
of the protests. The proposal to stage an all-national 
demonstration in Warsaw was backed, as one KK member put it, on 
such a scale as to "make all of the windowpanes in the Office of 
the Council of Ministers fall out." More than a dozen persons 
wanted to organize strikes; a few discussed the possibility of a 
general strike. According to observers, the union is not 
prepared for a major strike action. The appeals for strikes 
should be looked upon as a kind of stick. "S" authorities hope 
that the major price increases projected in the budget law will 
cause an increase in social impatience and spontaneous protests. 
Then the union will be able to try to organize a more serious 
strike action. 
  The unionists were very surprised that the government would 
like to obtain credit from the World Bank for the Mass 
Privatization Program and for the National Investment Funds. 
"The bill on the privatization of state-run enterprises no 
longer has the provisions in line with which all citizens are 
able to purchase the shares of privatized companies, in a 
situation of the insufficiency of domestic capital and savings. 
Thus, finally, there will be no chance of including the citizens 
in the processes of privatization," stated KK Presidium member 
Jerzy Ostrouch. 
  "S" has invited experts of the extraparliamentary 
center-right groupings to take part in the work of the team that 
is supposed to draft a constitution bill. The invitations will 
be extended by Chairman Krzaklewski. The team for the new 
constitution will set up a Senate Club of the Independent 
Self-Governing Trade Union "S." 
  According to the KK, the refusal to admit the states to NATO 
affronts the aspirations of societies that for half a year 
strove to regain their identity.

<F P=106> [Article by Eliza Olczyk and Marcin Dominik Zdort: "Will the </F>
SLD Split and How?"] 
  [Text] After two months of Waldemar Pawlak Cabinet's 
term, after the draft budget has been presented and the 
parliament has worked intensively, one can try to assess the 
direction in which the present Cabinet's actions are heading. 
Will this be a government that will manage to stop the run of 
misfortunes by surviving the parliament's entire term of office 
for the first time since 1989, or will it end up like the 
previous governments? Deputy Prime Minister Marek Borowski has 
been saying that changes will be introduced to the extent 
possible. Will these changes be sufficient? 
  Apart from an unshaken belief in the current Cabinet's 
success expressed by Zbigniew Siematkowski of the Democratic 
Left Alliance [SLD], other politicians have been having many 
fears, and these fears are not always accompanied by the 
malicious hope that the current coalition may be just another 
example of failure. 
<H5>  Winners' Optimism </H5>
  Zbigniew Siemiatkowski thinks that the coalition is heading 
in the right direction: "One can have doubts about whether the 
rate at which we are going is appropriate, or about whether 
everything contained in the SLD election program was 
implemented. In that regard, everyone, of course, has a right to 
his own opinion," he says. "We regard the 19 September elections 
as entering into a contract with society for four years. In the 
contract, there are some priority goals, and there are also some 
less important ones that will be implemented at a later stage. 
The year 1994 is a time of fundamental reorganization of the 
process of managing the state and also of macroeconomic 
processes aimed at eliminating the biggest irregularities in the 
economic policy. We are aware that society, while agreeing to 
the direction of the transformations, spoke against the social 
policy implemented thus far. We will try to coordinate the two 
processes, but it is not possible to do that within a few 
months. But some mechanisms were included even in the current 
budget draft, which will bring improvement for households as 
quickly as in two to three years." 
  According to Siemiatkowski, the main danger facing the 
current Cabinet comes from the impatience of those who expect 
quick successes, whereas the Cabinet's main chance is that it is 
in the comfortable position of being able to plan its policy. 
The previous cabinets did not have that comfort. 
  "The failure of our Cabinet and of our ideas would be a 
failure of the entire system," Siemiatkowski says. "The failure 
of the reforms carried through by the left-wing government would 
not automatically mean that society will put its faith in 
someone else from the left wing." 
  "The Union of Labor [UP] is further removed from the 
governing coalition today than at any time in the past," says UP 
leader Ryszard Bugaj. "Those who have a dominating position in 
the coalition--I do not think the entire coalition speaks with 
one voice--seem to have a preference for a strategy of 
adaptation that will leave the country's powerful centers 
intact." The moods and aspirations of big social groups play a 
minor role from the standpoint of that strategy. According to 
Bugaj, an attempt at a radical shift in the economic policy 
would be massively opposed by the press (that is, mostly the 
liberal press) and by the president, even if big social groups 
expected the policy to be implemented. Under the circumstances, 
the coalition's leadership decided in favor of trying to gain 
the support of small but strong pressure groups. Such a policy 
is dangerous because it can lead to a conviction in society that 
no matter how one votes on election day, the result is always 
the same, and big frustrations always result from such 
convictions. Part of the SLD is clearly heading toward a 
liberalization of the economy. Influential SLD activists think 
that the party will manage to achieve what the Democratic Union 
[UD] failed to achieve along with the liberals because the SLD 
has the left-wing label. That is not very likely to happen. 
  "Some of my colleagues have been watching that with 
satisfaction, thinking that UP will remain as the only credible 
political party that does not change its views," Bugaj says. 
"The trouble is that, during the next elections (it is not a 
certain thing at all that they must take place in four years 
because they might as well happen sooner), many people will 
decide that mistakes and failures are to be attributed to the 
so-called left wing, and we are included in that label." 
<H5>  "A Moment of Truth Will Come Soon" </H5>
  ...prophesies Bugaj. "A major danger to the coalition's 
coherency will come from radical social problems. They do exist 
even now anyway, but they will not be a danger to the coalition 
until they are articulated and transformed into specific action. 
That is because then the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement 
[OPZZ], which is very dependent on social moods, will have its 
room for maneuvering radically curtailed." 
  According to Janusz Piechocinski of the Polish Peasant 
Party [PSL], the next presidential elections are a prospect for 
the governing coalition (unless there is social unrest). With 
the current configuration of forces in parliament determined by 
the voters, presidential rules are the only alternative left at 
the coalition's disposal. So the coalition's stability is a 
guarantee for maintaining the parliamentary-Cabinet rules. The 
political calendar is advantageous to the governing coalition. 
We have both self-governmental and presidential elections coming 
up. Both Lech Walesa and Aleksander Kwasniewski have already 
begun their presidential campaigns. So the coalition has a very 
good chance of surviving till the time of the presidential 
election. But the coalition's weakest spot is in the individual 
parties that make it up. The government does not have to be 
afraid of losing 30 or 50 votes in the parliament because the 
margin of safety it enjoys is substantial. So the party leaders' 
biggest problems will concern what happens inside their 
individual parties. Aleksander Kwasniewski wants to change his 
electorate by courting those who up to now were UD voters, and 
by showing that the SLD is a modern type of party that cares 
about the country's stability. On the other hand, if Kwasniewski 
loses the votes of those who up to now were his electorate, he 
may lose the presidential election. That contradiction has been 
manifesting itself more and more though because Kwasniewski 
publicly admits to being a social-liberal, and that is primarily 
because he does not like poverty. But he has not yet decided to 
make such bold statements within the party itself, and this is 
the way it is going to be for a long time. 
  Besides, there are different trends within the SLD, and 
different aspirations as well. According to Piechocinski, coming 
into alliance with the Polish Socialist Party was a big mistake 
because it strengthened the extreme left-wing and orthodox wing 
within the SLD. The OPZZ is another problem because its leaders 
have big political ambitions, and, apart from that, an internal 
fight among various leaders is going on within it. Kwasniewski 
may face enormous problems with coming to grips with this 
phenomenon. In addition, the situation is being complicated by 
the position taken by UP, which remonstrates with the electorate 
upon... 
<H5>  The SLD Having Betrayed Left-Wing Ideals </H5>
  That causes a certain gap because the SLD's rank and file, 
who have been watching this, are asking themselves the question: 
"Apart from Kwasniewski's personal satisfaction, what is the use 
of a victory at all?" That may lead the SLD to transform itself 
into a federation of clubs that will not vote the same way in 
the Sejm. 
  The Polish Peasant Party [PSL] also faces a difficult 
situation because there have occurred big differentiations in 
the countryside, and there have emerged many groups there whose 
interests are completely different. It is impossible to satisfy 
all of them. That is how the big debate in the PSL concerning 
its program came about: What kind of a party is the PSL supposed 
to be, and what are its ideas concerning the state? If the PSL 
decides to meet the demands of all of its electorate groups on 
an immediate basis, that could create serious problems for the 
governing coalition. But the biggest danger comes from the 
possible lack of economic achievements. 
  "Unless there are such achievements, the current political 
elite will be thrown out with a bang because the voters will 
push them aside for their inefficiency," Piechocinski says. 
  Krzysztof Krol of the Confederation for an Independent 
Poland 
[KPN] predicts that a Belweder-peasant government will be formed 
in a few months. "The most likely scenario for the current 
governing coalition to split up is for a... 
<H5>  Conflict Between the SLD and the President </H5>
  ...to occur during the presidential election campaigns of 
Lech Walesa and Aleksander Kwasniewski," says Krol, who, under 
this scenario, also predicts the dismissal of the "postcommunist 
ministers" from the government, who had been recommended by the 
SLD. According to the KPN leader, the SLD will then be in the 
opposition, and we could see early elections. The current 
governing coalition could also be divided through evolutions of 
both parties, which today are bound by power and a similar past. 
"The PSL wants to become a centrist and a traditional kind of 
party, whereas the SLD wants to be social-democratic in order to 
replace UD," Krol says. 
  But Zbigniew Janas of UD thinks that the fate of the current 
coalition depends on what happens to the SLD itself: "There is 
an enormous external [as published] differentiation within the 
SLD, which is similar to the one present in the Citizens 
Parliamentary Club [OKP] after the elections of June 1989. It 
would be a worthwhile effort to examine the course of events 
leading up to the OKP's disintegration. Most probably a split 
within the SLD will take place at the same rate. For the moment, 
there is still the euphoria in the aftermath of the elections 
and the satisfaction after having taken over power, but disputes 
will begin when the government encounters its first problems," 
Janas says. According to the Sejm deputy for UD, internal 
opposition will increase its strength also within the PSL, which 
may pose a danger for the entire coalition. This is even more so 
because there will not be as much money devoted to agriculture 
as some would like to see. Janas thinks it would be a miracle if 
the coalition supporting Pawlak's Cabinet survived until the end 
of the four-year term.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksander Kwasniewski, leader of Social </F>
Democracy of the Polish Republic, by PAP correspondent Marzanna 
Doering; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Doering] Social Democracy of the Polish Republic 
[SdRP] is at present undergoing an astonishing metamorphosis. 
After a time of discreet silence on the subject of the feud 
between the government and local self-government structures, in 
mid-December it suddenly issued a statement of its position on 
that subject, a statement in which words like 
"decentralization," "self-government," and "citizens' society" 
literally abound. 
  [Kwasniewski] We have never, in fact, kept silent on the 
subject, and there is nothing paradoxical in the position 
adopted by the SdRP Supreme Council. Because a large number of 
misunderstandings have arisen around the questions of 
self-government and the administration reform, it was necessary 
to define our position clearly. After a debate on the subject, 
the Supreme Council adopted an official position that is now 
binding for us. In all of our dealings in parliament, as well as 
in internal government negotiations, we will defend the 
decentralization of power, the modeling of a citizens' society, 
the consolidation of self-government structures, and the 
expansion of the range of competence of these structures. These 
principles also apply to other self-government structures, such 
as self-government bodies in educational establishments, 
economic self-management bodies, and trade unions. Our interest 
in decentralization is not an expediency strategy. We believe 
that decentralization makes sense from the viewpoint of the new 
state structure and the new decisionmaking system. 
  [Doering] All of this sounds very fine. By voicing such 
views 
in the six months separating us from the planned local 
self-government elections, you can easily gain the reputation of 
a keen self-management advocate. At the same time, the Polish 
Peasant Party [PSL] has come to be seen as against local 
self-government structures--in a situation where the coalition 
is supposed to make joint decisions. 
  [Kwasniewski] On what grounds do you base your claim? 
  [Doering] I base it on the silence maintained by the 
Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] on the freeze imposed on the 
self-government pilot program, the suspension of the transfer of 
schools to parish authorities' management, and the collapse of 
the finances act, which entailed the preservation of the 
income-tax distribution system that is highly disadvantageous to 
active parishes and the absence of the compensation payments 
scheme for VAT [value-added-tax] induced losses. Should I go on 
with the list? All these decisions were made by the government 
and by parliament. 
  [Kwasniewski] The majority of these cases involved either 
unfortunate timing or other disadvantageous coincidence. If the 
government had not been appointed in October but rather, two or 
three months earlier, maybe we could have avoided a greater 
number of these setbacks. As it was, however, the government was 
destined to carry out its work on the budget in great haste. 
This was compounded by the need to attend to local 
self-government draft acts--for example, the finance act--which 
were not even prepared by the present government. Perhaps we 
should have shown more confidence in the work of our 
predecessors, but you cannot really deny the new government the 
right to make its own decisions in such important matters. If 
the previous cabinet had prepared a draft constitution, surely 
you would not insist that the new government should pass it on 
to parliament right away during its first session? 
  [Doering] I am not sure.... If it was a good enough 
project, I would probably not worry too much that it was not of 
my own making. But let us return to our main question: When can 
we expect the SdRP declarations of support for local 
self-government structures to be shored up by more tangible 
actions? 
  [Kwasniewski] We are all facing a forthcoming test--the 
local 
self-government elections scheduled for the end of May and the 
beginning of June. Then, all our proposals and decisions will be 
verified by the voters themselves. It is not as if we could get 
away with talking nonsense about the self-government system, or 
with doing nothing about it except making well-meaning noises. 
Self-government structures are at present controlled by the 
Democratic Union and other groups of similar political 
orientation. If it were to become apparent that the present 
coalition has not only failed to do anything tangible to further 
the cause of self-government but even halted the progress of 
certain self-government processes, I have not the slightest 
doubt that today's opposition would win the elections. On the 
other hand, if the coalition demonstrates successfully its 
honorable intentions concerning the self-government system, it 
will stand a good chance of succeeding. 
  [Doering] You speak as if the coalition were unanimous on 
the 
question of a reform of the system. 
  [Kwasniewski] I will not deny that from the very beginning 
there have been differences between us. The PSL is more 
cautious, and we in turn have no reason to question their 
knowledge of the functioning of self-government structures at 
the parish level. It is, after all, their own ground. The PSL 
has never questioned the need to decentralize power and to 
reinforce self-government structures, but it adopts a different 
viewpoint: We should put things in order first and reform them 
later. In my opinion, in certain areas this position is quite 
sensible, but in others it could possibly prove slightly too 
conservative. We have always believed that we should make 
decisions in favor of changes. We have expressed our political 
will and we will try to put it into practice. By mid-January, we 
will have held our first round of talks with the PSL. I hope 
that we will be able to decide whose position should prevail 
before the end of January. We need to make sure that a range of 
fundamental questions is sorted out first--first, the principles 
of financing the parishes; then, extension of their range of 
competence; finally, the issue of whether we should create a new 
system of districts. 
  [Doering] What if you come up against a brick wall in your 
talks with the PSL? 
  [Kwasniewski] We will then continue to discuss the same 
things in parliament. We are not alone there. 
  [Doering] What decisions should you be making in the 
question 
of the package of parliamentary bills prepared by Hanna 
Suchocka's government--that is, the district and voivodship 
reform, the central authorities reform, the reform of the civil 
service sector, the government order system, and the 
reorganization of the Council of Ministers Office [URM]? 
  [Kwasniewski] In all of these areas, changes are urgently 
necessary: There is no doubt whatsoever about that. The 
difficulties could begin as soon as we come to argue over the 
details--and the details fall within the brief of the working 
group for the public administration reform, appointed in 
mid-December by the SdRP Supreme Council. The civil service is a 
most important stabilizing element in the state administration 
system, and the sooner it is introduced, the better. We must 
find ways to minimalize corruption, and that goal is best served 
by a system of government orders. I would exercise the greatest 
caution toward the URM reorganization project. I always suspect 
that all reorganization is the result of the need for a radical 
review of the personal appointments in the given system. 
Regardless of whether the URM is given a new name and whether it 
is left as one bloc or divided into three general directorates, 
it will always be with us because it has three important 
functions to fulfill: provision of services to the government 
and the prime minister; legislation and contacts with 
parliament; and coordination of the operations of local 
government administration. 
  [Doering] In the latest campaign, the SLD made a firm pledge 
of support for the district reform. What districts and when? 
Minister Strak says: Let us first put the local state 
administration in individual regions in order, and then we can 
decide whether we should organize self-government elections 
there. 
  [Kwasniewski] In my opinion, once you have started 
something, it is advisable to see it through. Stopping a new 
development as soon as you started seems to me too defensive a 
strategy. There is no sense in maintaining the regional system 
today: The regions are, as it were, semidistrict creations, and 
as such they remain strictly artificial. We must make it quite 
clear that we intend to finish what we started. The district 
reform will mean that the number of voivodships will be reduced 
to about 15-20. This will inevitably cause heated arguments and 
conflicts because the parliament that approved that formula for 
the reform was chosen to represent the present configuration of 
49 voivodships. We can expect that all conceivable sorts of 
lobbies will be set up and activated in defense of the status 
quo. If, say, we return to the original blueprint of 17 
voivodships, what do you expect will be the reaction of the 
deputies from the 32 voivodships that would then cease to exist? 
They would have to go back to their earlier milieus and local 
configurations--but many present voivodship centers have already 
become accustomed to wielding their local power. 
  [Doering] The PSL wants voivodships to function in the 
self-government system. 
  [Kwasniewski] I do not see justification for the correctness 
of this concept in our circumstances because Poland functions as 
a unitary system. If a state is not organized as a federal or 
individual laender system, voivodships should be 
linked to the central authorities, and voivodas should represent 
the central government. 
  [Doering] Because we have come to the subject of voivodas, 
let me cite your own words spoken before 19 September: "We will 
not check individuals' party membership cards to assert from 
which political affiliations people come to us. If they have 
satisfactory qualifications, they should be placed in those 
posts where their abilities will be put to the best use." 
  [Kwasniewski] I still subscribe to that opinion. 
  [Doering] How does it square with the announcement that you 
will replace existing voivodas by people from the victorious 
coalition? 
  [Kwasniewski] Anyone who charges me with calling for purges 
will be at serious odds with the truth. I said that a new 
political situation arose as a result of the election. I may 
even apologize that the old government lost the election, but 
that is what happened. Today there are people who say: "We are 
not interested in politics, but we are at your disposal." If 
they are competent administrators, they will retain their posts. 
And there are also others who say: "We do not see a place for us 
here anymore; our mission is over." That was precisely what took 
place in Pila, Zielona Gora, and Wloclawek. There are now 
vacancies there. How do you imagine we should go about finding 
new candidates to these posts? Pick them off the street? Or from 
the opposition's ranks? We have adopted the principle that the 
group that won the election in a given voivodship can assume 
initiative in this matter. Because that means that that group 
has at its disposal the most numerous personnel reserves to be 
recruited from among its broad base of supporters. However, 
candidates must still obtain approval from the voivodship's 
self-government assembly. And the candidates from Pila, Zielona 
Gora, and Olsztyn did obtain such approval. These people are by 
no means party apparatchiks: They are all competent experts. 
  [Doering] The SdRP December statement contained a mention of 
a proposed change in the election law, designed to improve 
representation at parish level. Does this suggest that you agree 
with Minister Strak when he claims that councils are not 
representative? 
  [Kwasniewski] The May 1990 elections were won by citizens' 
committees. But where are citizens' committees today? We have 
also introduced candidates from a variety of electoral lists 
into the councils. 
  [Doering] That problem could be resolved in the elections 
themselves rather than through changes in the electoral law. 
  [Kwasniewski] We are considering a proposal to choose parish 
elders and town and city mayors in universal suffrage, although 
opinions on that solution are rather divided. 
  [Doering] What would be the SdRP's interest in such a move? 
  [Kwasniewski] Precisely. I am not altogether sure whether it 
would be in our interest. That is why we are still hesitating. 
Local self-government elections do not attract much popular 
attention, so it could be that such direct choice would enhance 
their attractiveness and increase the chance of stimulating 
local communities to greater activity. 
  [Doering] In other words, it would pull those who are as yet 
undecided toward you? 
  [Kwasniewski] I do not see it in terms of political 
interest. 
Let me risk a prediction: The approaching elections will end in 
a big compromise, and no one will be able to say that they have 
won an unqualified victory in it.

<F P=106> [Article by Ada Kostrz-Kostecka: "How Many Changes, How Much </F>
Continuation?"] 
  [Text] Did the fact that a coalition government was formed 
cause any changes in the privatization program? Or is it really 
a continuation of the methods employed so far? 
  This is the diagnosis that the participants of a seminar 
organized by the Economic Sciences Institute of the Polish 
Academy of Sciences tried to make. 
  According to Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek, who participated in 
the seminar, the weakness of the ownership transformation 
processes carried out so far has been the lack of a 
privatization strategy, linking it to the economic policy, lack 
of the criteria for the evaluation of the transformations, and 
analyses of their effects. The founders' supervision over the 
partnerships was insufficient; however, these shortcomings are 
not being eliminated. There are still difficulties in 
communicating with trade unions. Privatization with the 
participation of private individuals acting as strategic 
investors was also not always successful. Motivation for 
privatization is still only passive (the desire to escape 
dividends and the popiwek--tax on excessive wage increases--or 
the managers' desire to maintain a "row of souls" in the 
enterprise). The characteristic feature of Polish ownership 
transformations is also the modest participation of capital 
privatization; employee's privatization is dominating, which 
large enterprises advised against. In the past, the ownership 
laws were not set in order; it concerns reprivatization and 
cooperative property. 
  Minister Kaczmarek wants to continue employing the 
privatization techniques that have been used so far; however, at 
the same time, along with other ministries, he intends to draw 
up a "privatization map." The map will show strategic areas, in 
which the Treasury will maintain most of the shares, and the 
other areas, which will not be limited in ownership 
transformations. Privatization procedures will be set in order. 
It is also planned that a dormant path of privatization--that 
is, auctions--will be established. The minister believes that 
most of the property that could be sold at once was actually 
sold; the rest of the enterprises need restructuring before this 
could be done. This is supposed to be achieved through the 
program of National Investment Funds, EFSAL [expansion unknown] 
and the SRP [expansion unknown], financed by the European Bank 
for Reconstruction and Development and the European Community. 
  The scientists participating in the seminar focused first on 
remarks concerning the transformations that have been made so 
far, as well as on conclusions concerning the future. According 
to Barbara Blaszczyk, in the "Directions of Privatization" for 
1994, too many priorities were adopted; therefore, it will be 
difficult to implement all of them. So far, the employees' 
privatization, powered by the initiative "from below," has been 
the quickest; therefore, the "Pact on State Enterprise" 
unnecessarily imposes on enterprises a six-month period for 
selecting a privatization path. The employees of large and good 
enterprises--for example, those that are sent to the Stock 
Exchange--gain too much in privatization. In comparison with 
other countries, the overall balance sheet of privatization 
looks good; it is just a pity that some partnerships have become 
stuck in the intermediate stage. 
  According to Tadeusz Kowalik, the tensions concerning 
privatization need to be lessened; however, he does not know 
whether the minister will manage to achieve this. Privatization 
should be accelerated, but this process must be healthier than 
it has been so far. 
  According to Anna Fornalczyk, privatization depended on 
politics, it still does, and it will continue to depend on it; 
however, efforts will have to be made to eliminate it. In 
Poland, there is still not enough evaluation of privatization 
results; therefore, continuous monitoring [preceding word in 
English] must be established. Maria Jarosz believes that 
employees' partnerships should be looked upon as a transitional 
form; she adds that they should be allowed to look for capital 
and to concentrate on property. 
  Zofia Dobska fears that partial privatization--where the 
Treasury keeps some of the shares--is not being employed as much 
as it should be. In the meantime, as a result of the recession, 
which is felt not only in Poland, the prices that are arrived at 
in transactions are not really satisfactory. The lack of foreign 
capital should be explained by the fact that, in recent years, 
privatization in the postsocialist states has amounted to merely 
5 percent of the global ownership transformations; 25 percent in 
Third World countries and 75 percent in developed countries [as 
published]. 
  While answering questions, Minister Kaczmarek mentioned the 
possibility of supporting privatization through the emission of 
obligations, which could be converted into ownership titles, and 
the establishment of a system of credit pledges guaranteed by 
the state.

<F P=106> [Article by Anna Wozniak: "Tiger on the Vistula? Upper </F>
Silesia's Future Rests on Winning Special Economic Zone Status"] 
  [Text] For a while now, the Western press has carried 
predictions of the expected emergence of a new "European Tiger." 
Previously, that aggressive title was reserved exclusively for 
the economies of such East Asian countries as Taiwan, South 
Korea, Singapore, and others. This time it is Poland's turn, and 
we find the news somewhat surprising, to say the least. 
  However, the Western observers' conclusion is drawn from the 
study of the Central Office of Planning [CUP] official economic 
forecast for the next four years, which includes a detailed 
prognosis for the next year. Minister Miroslaw Pietrewicz, who 
heads CUP, maintains that, over the next four years, we will be 
able to consolidate the economic growth that has already been 
noted, and even accelerate it. According to the forecast, the 
gross national product should grow at the rate of 4.2 percent 
per year, our exports by 5.5 percent, and public consumption by 
14 percent. All of this should be accompanied by a 9-percent 
annual increase in capital investment. These projected figures 
are comparable with the indexes achieved by Asia's "economic 
tigers," and that fact gave rise to the aforementioned 
analogies, which are further reinforced by the proven accuracy 
of recent CUP forecasts. 
  Will the latest CUP prognoses be just as accurate? This 
depends first and foremost on our politicians and the policies 
they pursue--in other words, on precisely those factors that 
should not affect the economy. The latest CUP predictions were 
prepared during Hanna Suchocka's rule, whereas the task of their 
realization will be entrusted to the new government, commonly 
dubbed the government of the left. It has to be admitted that 
Prime Minister Pawlak and his ministers have pledged their 
intention of maintaining the direction of the reforms, including 
privatization and controlled inflation. However, voices have 
been heard heralding interventionist policies, which should 
encourage exports on the one hand and promote our own 
agriculture and industry on the other. A small measure of state 
intervention will not harm our interests, and privatization 
should be carried out avoiding unjust treatment of work forces 
in the process and at a slightly slower rate, according to the 
opinion of the government team and its economic advisers. 
  Only such nuances could now alter the accuracy of the 
forecasts. However, other economists see our aspirations to the 
title of "Europe's tigers" in bleaker terms. One of them, 
Andrzej Krzysztof Wroblewski, wrote in his paper, GAZETA 
BANKOWA, that the sight of the steadily shortening lines of 
people bringing their savings to banks and the correspondingly 
lengthening lines of company directors applying in the same 
banks to have their debts annulled filled him with pessimism. 
His pessimism was, according to him, an answer to the optimism 
of those who hope that the left-wing government will not expect 
people to work hard but will, instead, allow employers to pay 
them more. Such optimists see the supposed proof of the 
correctness of their views in the government's decision to 
abolish the "popiwek" tax [on above-normative wages] on 1 April 
1994. 
  Regular polls carried out by the Public Opinion Survey 
Center 
[CBOS] confirm a steady rise of popular optimism after the 
September election and the appointment of the new government. At 
the same time, CBOS analyses show that Polish people assess 
their material situation as rather modest. However, compared 
with the situation prevailing 18 months ago, they appear to have 
a stronger sense of material security. This opinion should be 
modified by adding that the relevant polls were carried out 
toward the end of November, so their respondents could not have 
known the scenario of the December "packet" of price rises 
announced for the coming year. An avalanche of these price 
increases is due to be triggered on the last night of the year 
and will hurtle onward right through until December 1994. The 
draft budget approved on Christmas Eve assumed a 27-percent 
increase in the prices of consumer goods and services! To make 
matters worse, forecasts concerning the situation in the labor 
market are hardly any better. It is expected that unemployment 
will continue to grow throughout 1994 and that, in four years' 
time, it could still be only 5 percent lower than in 1994. 
  No one is a prophet in his own country, and that is perhaps 
why Western observers perceive our chances in a more optimistic 
light--starting with Professor Jeffrey Sachs and ending with 
Western businessmen, who recently seem to be somewhat more 
inclined to invest in Poland than they appeared before. They all 
agree that the obvious continuing modernization of our 
infrastructure, from the banking system through the 
communications system to the construction of freeways, speaks in 
favor of treating us with such new confidence, as does the 
continuing growth tendency noted in our economy. 
  Unfortunately, prospects for the Katowice Voivodship appear 
rather black against that optimistic background picture. Such 
neighboring voivodships as Bielsko-Biala and Czestochowa have 
recorded a steady increase in their sold output, so they enjoy 
rather hopeful expectations and forecasts. However, the region 
of [Upper] Silesia will not be able to activate its economic 
potential by itself, considering its lack of gross profit-making 
capacity, the extent of its debt liabilities, and the absence of 
credit-generating capacity on the part of the majority of the 
giant state enterprises representing predominantly such branches 
of heavy industry as mining and the metallurgical industry. This 
absence of a growth potential in [Upper] Silesia will persist 
even in the case of a hypothetical economic boom enjoyed by the 
rest of the country. This is because--as we will 
remember--according to an analysis prepared a while ago by the 
EEC of the development prospects of Poland's individual regions, 
Upper Silesia is treated as a moribund industrial zone. This is 
bad news for the region's rating as regards its potential for 
attracting foreign investors. That is why its future depends, 
among other things, on whether the Katowice Voivodship manages 
to win the status of a special economic zone. Unfortunately, 
Warsaw and its power centers are not at all eager to accord it 
such a status. 
  As we can see, the answer to the question "What will 1994 be 
like for us?" will depend on a great many factors. Some of those 
will be external factors that we cannot influence ourselves. 
Nevertheless, our country should by no means be regarded as a 
peripheral area of Europe, and such developments as stemming the 
recession in the West, securing lasting peace in the world (and 
especially in Europe), shaping correct relations with our 
neighbors, and the unveiling of Russia's war doctrine will not 
be irrelevant to our condition and our assessment of our 
situation in the coming year. 
  Will a new "tiger" be born in Europe? And will it be a 
"Polish tiger"? The question remains open, but even the fact 
that it has been posed bodes well for us. Who would have dared 
to come up with such a prospect as recently as two years ago?

<F P=106> [Article by Agnieszka Kublik: "BBC Idea on News Agency in </F>
Poland"] 
  [Text] British public television, the BBC, wants to create 
a news agency in Poland called "Independent Television News 
[Niezalezne Wiadomosci Telewizyjne NW-TV]," which 
would compete with the Television Information Agency [TAI]. 
  The BBC has already approached Polsat, the satellite 
television channel, with an offer to form a company in this 
regard. "Polsat holds a broadcasting license, and the BBC does 
not work with pirates," said BBC Polish section chief Eugeniusz 
Smolar, explaining this move. 
  The agency's offices would be in Warsaw, and it would be 
financed by all of the television channels belonging to it. The 
agency would function as a joint-stock company, whose 
controlling shares would belong to the BBC. "Polsat would like 
to have most of the shares," Polsat chief Boguslaw Chrabota 
admitted. 
  The BBC's idea is as follows. The new agency would produce 
and supply Polish private television channels with several news 
programs daily, plus footage on political, economic, social, and 
cultural events. 
  In addition, the BBC is offering the Poles their own "BBC 
World Service" program, British television news footage, 
assistance in setting up NW-TV's Warsaw offices, and training 
for Polish reporters. 
  Smolar warns, however, that these are only working 
proposals, 
and everything is yet to be decided between the BBC and the 
eventual partners. 
  "We want to create a strong alternative to Polish television 
news," says Smolar. "The reason that British television is so 
good is that it has strong competition. In Great Britain, ITN 
[Independent Television News] competes with the BBC. ITN is a 
kind of news agency of the private television channels, which 
share a common information service." 
  The commercial channels to whom the BBC offer is addressed 
have still not reached a decision. Miroslaw Chojecki of NTP 
Plus, which is seeking a license for nationwide Polish 
television, told us that "he does not know enough about this 
idea." But he realizes that it would be cheaper to use the NW-TV 
service than create one's own news agency. 
  At Nicola Grauso's Polonia 1 channel, which is currently 
setting up a network of over a dozen local stations, we were 
told that each station must decide for itself whether it wants 
to cooperate with the BBC. The Warsaw-based NTW, which is part 
of Grauso's network, does not yet know whether it will buy the 
idea.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 12 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign Minister 
Josef Zieleniec said today that it would be in the Czech 
Republic's interest that its neighbors belong in the same 
military grouping. Speaking with CTK after the dinner he hosted 
for his counterparts from the Visegrad Group, which comprises 
besides the Czech Republic also Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia, 
he said that "no one wants his border to be the border of 
confrontation." 
  Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski said that Poland 
would not object to one Visegrad country entering NATO earlier 
than the others. "But if Poland were the first, this would not 
be in harmony with its security interests," he stressed. 
  Slovak Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik said he thought that 
all Visegrad Group countries had good reasons to closely 
cooperate and that they enjoyed similar conditions within the 
Partnership for Peace project. 
  At a press conference following the dinner, Zieleniec said 
that in addition to technical-military measures, which are 
already being prepared by the Czech Defense Ministry, the 
political dimension of the Partnership for Peace should also be 
dealt with. He said that closer political cooperation must be 
established with the NATO countries. "This is the road that 
leads towards building a firm defense union in Europe," he 
stressed. 
  Zieleniec and his Hungarian counterpart Geza Jeszenszky said 
they gave priority to political consultations. 
  Moravcik said that Slovakia favored a balanced course of 
action that would combine both the political and military 
aspects of the project. 
  Polish Minister Andrzej Olechowski said he expected first 
missions of the U.S. Army and NATO to come to the Visegrad 
countries. 
  Poland's partial dissatisfaction with the Partnership for 
Peace is due to the lack of specific prospects for admission 
into NATO, Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski said 
following a dinner of the Visegrad foreign ministers this 
evening. "We have many promises, political declarations, but we 
lack specific prospects," he said. 
  The artificial border between the two parts of Europe that 
was created in 1945 will continue to divide Europe as long as 
those countries nearing the West politically, economically, and 
by their moral values are pushed aside, said Hungarian Foreign 
Minister Geza Jeszenszky. 
  Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec termed the 
Partnership 
for Peace an important step towards integrating the Visegrad 
countries with NATO and towards building a new security 
architecture in Europe. "If more partners are to agree, none of 
them will get 100 percent of what they want," he said. He 
stressed, however, that the project in its current form, as 
opposed to the original version, had extraordinarily significant 
political dimensions. 
  Slovak Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik said that it is 
important that the Partnership for Peace be followed quickly by 
further steps.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 12 (CTK) -- The Partnership for Peace 
plan approved at the NATO summit in Brussels this week is a step 
forward, but a too small one, the Polish delegation to the 
Prague summit meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and 
the heads of the Visegrad countries (Czech Republic, Slovakia, 
Hungary, and Poland) said at a press conference following talks 
with the Hungarian and Slovak delegations. 
  Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski said that the 
Polish Government must still approve the partnership, but ruled 
out the possibility that the government would reject the 
project. He said that the government had already charged the 
premier with supporting the project and expressing Poland's 
willingness to participate in it. 
  The Partnership for Peace will not remove a dangerous 
political vacuum, but has enough provisions to prevent one from 
appearing, Olechowski said. Poland is not striving for 
admission into NATO out of fear for its own security, but rather 
because the membership of Central and Eastern European countries 
in European structures should be a guarantee that this part of 
Europe does not become a "gray zone." 
  Olechowski said that joint exercises between Polish and NATO 
military units could be held this year. He did not rule out the 
possibility that other partners would also participate in the 
exercises, but added that it is important to consider the 
political consequences of such activities in advance. 
  Polish Premier Waldemar Pawlak said at the press conference 
that the continued existence of the Visegrad Group would not be 
decided on through top-level political talks but through 
concrete cooperation. Poland is interested in developing its 
infrastructure and communications, he said, citing the planned 
construction of a highway south from Gdansk, which he said would 
be important not only for Poland but for the other Visegrad 
countries as well. Poland would also welcome the opening of 
American and Western European markets to Central European, 
particularly Polish, goods, he said.

  [Excerpt] Bratislava, January 11 (CTK) -- [passage 
omitted] The source for the report concerning Slovakia published 
by the Helsinki Commission of the U.S. Congress on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe [as received] on September 17 last year 
were newspapers which, given their economic results, should have 
long ago gone bankrupt and died, Transport and Communications 
Minister Roman Hofbauer says in an interview for REPUBLIKA. 
REPUBLIKA is the daily of the government-run Slovak News Agency. 
  These newspapers have evidently prospered from foreign 
sources, Hofbauer says, with their reports on minorities coming 
from Hungarian press cuttings. He says Slovakia is the only 
European post-communist country which has thoroughly redressed 
the wrongs of the past which were committed against all 
religions. 
  On the subject of press freedom in Slovakia, Hofbauer says 
the government is basing its policy on the Council of Europe's 
resolution on journalistic ethics. Hofbauer adds no one in the 
government has the task of inspecting the press, because in 
Slovakia there is no censorship. 
  Statements about the "extermination of Hungarian from road 
signs" are "considerably exaggerated," he says, because in every 
state there is a legal form for road signs which cannot be 
changed at will. If it could, there would be organizational 
chaos in transport, Hofbauer says. 
  He says that Premier Vladimir Meciar's speech last September 
about the Romany community was the work of CTK journalist Karel 
Hirman, who put the words into the premier's mouth. This is why 
legal proceedings have been started against Hirman. 
  Last autumn's physical attack on Rabbi Baruch Mayers was 
connected with the growth in crime and had nothing to do with 
race, Hofbauer says. The offenders were detained and the stolen 
object, a hat, was returned to its owner, Hofbauer says. 
  There is therefore no need to fear for democracy in 
Slovakia, 
and it is enough to confirm "the continuation of the journey to 
its own promised land," Hofbauer said. The results which 
Slovakia achieved in its first year of independence are better 
than international politologists and economic forecasters 
predicted, Hofbauer tells REPUBLIKA. [passage omitted]

  [Text] This evening, Romania's President Iliescu received 
the chief of staff of the French Army Jacques Lanxade, who is 
currently paying an official visit to our country. 
  Cooperation between Romania and France in the military area 
and in other areas of joint interest were the major issues of 
discussion. 
  After the meeting, Mr. Jacques Lanxade told the journalists 
the following: Together with the president of the republic [as 
heard], who did me the honor of receiving me, we first discussed 
cooperation between France and Romania in the areas of security 
and defense, and then we surveyed the situation in Europe in 
general and in this region in particular. And finally, we 
discussed the evolution of security structures in Europe after 
the NATO summit in Brussels. 
  The French guest also said: I can say that the relations 
between Romania and France in all spheres, and particularly in 
the area of defense, are very dynamic, very warm, and are based 
on history. We resumed these contacts more than two years ago 
and we are expecting to develop them. I am very optimistic that 
we will manage to accomplish durable things together. 
  Answering the question of what his opinions about Romania 
are 
currently, Jacque Lanxade said: I believe that Romania is 
making efforts to restore a difficult economic situation, a 
situation with which other countries are also currently 
confronted, countries that have changed their situation in 
recent years. Romania is seeking to make its actions felt in 
the international community and is developing cooperation with 
several countries. I believe that Romania is a country in which 
much hope can be laid. 
  Asked whether he has visited Romania before, he answered: I 
know Romania only a little, because I arrived only this morning 
and will start visiting it tomorrow. But I arrived here mainly 
to work. 
  Previously, the French Military delegation was also received 
by Romania's national defense minister, Lieutenant General 
Niculae Spiroiu. The latter briefed the guest about the actions 
taken to restructure and modernize the Romanian Army and to 
achieve the competitiveness of this army with the armies of the 
countries that have a long democratic tradition. The sides 
exchanged views on ways to ensure security and preserve 
stability and peace in Europe and throughout the world. 
  The sides also revealed the joint wish to develop bilateral 
relations in the interest of the two armies. 
  Tonight, the French military delegation was also received by 
the Romanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Theodor Melescanu.

  [Text] Today Madeleine Albright, U.S. permanent 
representative at the United Nations, who arrived in Bulgaria 
today, was received, respectively, by President of the Republic 
Zhelyu Zhelev and Prime Minister Lyuben Berov. Ms. Albright 
briefed them on the U.S. Partnership for Peace Initiative, which 
has already been adopted by NATO. 
  Ms. Albright expressed the U.S. expectation that Bulgaria 
will also be one of the East European states to join in this 
initiative. Ms. Albright voiced the U.S. Administration's 
willingness to continue to provide economic assistance to the 
countries of Central and Eastern Europe. According to her, the 
financing of infrastructure projects, mainly in the 
transportation and communications fields, will be of particular 
importance for Bulgaria. 
  Dr. Zhelev confirmed his insistent invitation to President 
Bill Clinton to visit Bulgaria. 
  At both meetings, discussions were held on Yugoslav crisis 
issues and the sanctions imposed on Serbia and Montenegro. 
President Zhelev expressed the view that certain indirect 
measures are already in hand to alleviate the losses that 
Bulgaria is suffering from observing the Yugoslav embargo, but 
we hope to obtain even better trade possibilities with the 
United States and to see an influx of new U.S. investments into 
Bulgaria.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 13 January (TANJUG) -- The President of 
the Muslim Presidency in Sarajevo, Alija Izetbegovic, has spoken 
of further armed struggle for a united Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
the survival of Islam in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  At a session late last night in Sarajevo, the Party of 
Democratic Action [Stranka Demokratske Akcije--SDA] elected its 
new organs and leadership. Addressing the session he said that 
"everything is different now" because his forces number 200,000 
soldiers. The SDA leader said that the war in Bosnia would 
continue until the Serbs gave up all the territories which had 
been predominantly populated by Muslims before the outbreak of 
the conflict. 
  Advocating again an undivided Bosnia, Izetbegovic admitted 
openly for the first time that the Muslims had organized 
themselves for armed secession from Yugoslavia ten months before 
the outbreak of war on 6 April 1992. "I would like to recall a 
meeting in the Police Hall in Sarajevo on 10 June 1991 attended 
by 380 people from the entire former Yugoslavia and the 
declaration we issued then, ten months before the beginning of 
the war. In that declaration we heralded the beginning of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina's armed defense." 
  Izetbegovic said that the Muslims ought to continue along 
this path while opening up the party to members of other 
peoples. The SDA should admit all those who are willing to 
fight for Bosnia-Herzegovina, he said. In his view the main 
criterion for membership is "whether or not someone has remained 
loyal to the people" referring obviously to the Muslim people he 
leads. 
  Despite the fact that a vast majority of Serbs and Croats 
have opted for their independent republics, Izetbegovic said for 
the umpteenth time that they, too, ostensibly wanted a united 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "There is no united Bosnia without the Serbs and Croats as 
all the Muslims, most of the Croats and a considerable number of 
Serbs want a united Bosnia-Herzegovina", he said. "There are two 
stages of struggle. The one phase of struggle for Bosnia's 
integration is of a military nature, the other is political. I 
used to quote that poet of ours who said: "By God we swear we 
shall not be slaves." 
  At the same time Izetbegovic commented on the claims that he 
wanted to create an Islamic republic. 
  "I am telling you clearly here that I am not in favor of an 
Islamic republic. Yet, I do want Islam to survive in these 
lands. We want to remain what we are. I do not know why we 
should do this. We illustrate here, European Islam. We 
illustrate a kind of modern Islam", he said. 
  "To this end we can do a great deal for both the East and 
West," the leader of Muslims said in conclusion and added that 
they would try to achieve this as democrats.

  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] On one side we have Croatia's 
efforts for peace and a call for peace by the European Union, 
and on the other side the Muslims are maneuvering with the war 
option and the display of force. [passage omitted] 
  Late this afternoon Minister Granic held talks with Haris 
Silajdzic. 
  [Begin Granic recording] "The European Union has sent a 
(?memorandum) in which it warns all the sides to make all 
possible efforts to achieve an urgent end to hostilities and an 
agreement. This is probably one of the most important days of 
the Geneva negotiations. If no agreement is reached, there is a 
big chance that the war will intensify even further. 
  Croatia is making extreme efforts to bring about an end to 
the conflict and, in the spirit of the agreement that President 
Tudjman proposed to President Izetbegovic, primarily an end to 
the conflict between the Croats and the Muslims, and to reach an 
agreement between them. Croatia is also making efforts to 
normalize relations between Croatia and Serbia on the basis of 
mutual recognition and of certain necessary preconditions. That 
was the main topic of all the talks today, the lengthy talks 
with Prime Minister Silajdzic and with the Bosnian Muslim 
delegation." [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Those who initiate further clashes in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will end up losers. These were the words of 
Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's special envoy, after 
his talks with Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic. This is 
Tihomir Vinkovic reporting for Croatian radio news from Geneva. 
  Churkin believes that tomorrow's meeting of all interested 
sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina must bring progress. However, it is 
too optimistic to expect that the agreement will be signed 
tomorrow, Churkin said. He believes that the talks should go 
along the line of the EU [European Union] proposal. Too much 
effort and time have been invested to introduce fundamental 
changes at this point, Churkin believes. Unfortunately, there 
are still forces that want war. Churkin said that President 
Tudjman's proposal, brought up in Bonn, was interesting, 
especially the part concerning access to the sea. 
  The Russian Federation obviously supports the EU's stance, 
and, judging by the news from Moscow, so does America. The 
behavior of the Muslim side is in complete contravention of the 
European Twelve's stance. Their response to the peace 
initiative is negative. The opinion prevails that the Muslims 
would like the UN Security Council to take over the 
negotiations, which both the EU and America oppose. 
  The problem is a European one, and consequently it should be 
dealt with in Europe, Croatian Minister Mate Granic said. An 
absolute cease-fire should come into effect in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and a political solution should be found in 
line with the EU's proposal. This is Croatia's stand, about 
which Vitaliy Churkin has been informed.

  [Text] Only a few minutes ago we learned the following 
from Raycho Raykov, spokesman for the Council of Ministers: 
  The sharp escalation of incidents related to organized crime 
have evoked a broad discussion in our society and the mass 
media. In this context, Prime Minister Lyuben Berov has been 
consulting with Valentin Karabashev and Evgeni Matinchev, deputy 
chairmen of the Council of Ministers; Minister of the Interior 
Viktor Mikhaylov; and other high-ranking state officials since 
yesterday. 
  The specific circumstances surrounding the recent brazen 
violations of the public order and the struggle against crime 
are being clarified. 
  At the behest of Minister Mikhaylov, the participants in the 
consultations discussed many specific measures aimed at sharply 
improving the legal order in the country. 
  Assuming total responsibility for the tragic incident of 14 
January in Belite Brezi, Minister Viktor Mikhaylov tendered his 
resignation to Lyuben Berov, chairman of the Council of 
Ministers. The resignation will be discussed tomorrow by the 
Council of Ministers.

  [Text] In a secret ballot, with 13 votes against, the 13 
members of the cabinet unanimously refused to accept the 
resignation tendered by Minister of Internal Affairs Viktor 
Mikhaylov. 
  His colleagues appreciated the gesture as a moral act, but 
agreed with the view that such a step is totally uncalled for 
and even dangerous under the present circumstances, considering 
the uneasy situation in the departments of the ministry. 
  The cabinet heard and approved a report read by the minister 
of internal affairs about recently increasing incidents on our 
western borders, related to the attempts of private companies to 
violate the embargo against former Yugoslavia, especially by 
exporting oil products. 
  Prime Minister Lyuben Berov and three of the cabinet 
ministers are scheduled to propose the necessary measures for 
increased controls, particularly over officials in charge of 
exercising the controls on exports to former Yugoslavia. 
  At today's session the Council of Ministers decided to 
expand 
the functions of the Power Engineering Committee. 
  The exports, imports, and distribution of natural gas are 
and 
the gradual discontinuation of uranium extraction and partial 
processing are already within the committee's competence. An 
guideline on determining the 10 categories of agricultural land 
in connection with changing their purpose was also adopted at 
today's session. 
  Minister of Health Tancho Gugalov is in charge of the 
donation amounting to $520,000 granted by the Japanese 
Government for draftng a program on the reorganization of the 
health sector. 
  The government further approved Bulgaria's participation in 
the Partnership for Peace Program by special resolution based on 
a report submitted by Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov and 
Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov. The cabinet authorized 
the signing of the [word indistinct] document proposed by NATO 
on the subject. A specially appointed working group is in 
charge of drafting specific proposals on our country's 
participation in the Partnership for Peace program. 
  Today the cabinet ministers were obliged to leave the 
conference hall for a recess, because of the inspection 
following an anonymous call about a bomb being placed in the 
Council of Ministers building.

  [Text] Sofia, Jan. 15 (A.A) -- Turkey and Bulgaria will 
take joint action against terrorism. Bulgarian anti-terror 
department director Feodor Vladimirov told AA that they have met 
with Turkish officials in July and have signed a cooperation 
protocol against international terror organizations. He added 
that the matter had been kept in secret so far, for security 
reasons. 
  During the meeting Turkish officials briefed their Bulgarian 
colleagues on the terror organization in Turkey and gave 
detailed information on the connections of these in Europe. 
Vladimirov said that Bulgaria was being used as a bridge in 
drug and arms smuggling. 
  "We also know that some separatist terrorists are 
temporarily 
staying in Bulgaria when they flee to Europe. However, terror 
groups are not using Bulgaria as a shelter," he said.

  [Text] What would happen should Dr. Zhelev decide to test 
the voters' confidence, namely the confidence of those who 
already cast their vote for him in the direct elections? Despite 
the endless attacks launched against him, Dr. Zhelev does not 
seem afraid and is not behaving accordingly. He by no means 
appears helpless either. 
  He hardly relies solely on his popularity which, as 
reflected 
by the results of all public opinion polls on political figures, 
seems to be the most stable. 
  In an interview with the Bulgarian National Radio Network 
yesterday, Dr. Zhelev declared that if anyone should try to 
jeopardize the successes achieved in settling Bulgaria's foreign 
debt or boycott the restored confidence of the international 
financial circles in our country, he would be forced to publicly 
declare such acts as high treason against the nation. 
  Naturally, his statement should not be interpreted as 
digging 
up the tomahawk against his opponents. 
  Dr. Zhelev has long since and repeatedly proposed the option 
of a political and parliamentary consensus as the only possible 
method of coping with the difficulties of the transition period 
and of successfully proceeding with the reform. 
  Both parliament and the relevant political forces rejected 
his offer. 
  Hence, one should not be surprised if the attacks against 
the 
Presidency should ricochet in the form of a boomerang. 
  It was hardly false modesty that prompted Dr. Zhelev to 
admit 
that he considers himself a president for the transition period 
and to add that he would not run for a new term of office. 
Nevertheless, he will see to it that the tasks, for the sake of 
which he was elected by direct vote, should not remain 
unfinished and he will take advantage of his remaining three 
years of office for this purpose. 
  This is so because he does not feel isolated from the 
people. 
  Hence, Zhelev being convinced of public support for his 
cause, we should not be surprised if he should seek confirmation 
for this support through a public referendum in an attempt to 
find out how much the constantly quoted "people" appreciate him. 
  In case of his defeat in such a referendum, he should blame 
his advisers and the sociologists.

situation of political tension, states a memorandum adopted this 
evening at a special session of the Council for Cooperation. 
  According to the members of the council, what is needed is 
for all the political forces in the country to rally around the 
national priorities. According to the memorandum, parliament 
must speed up its work on establishing the legislative basis for 
regulating the political, economic, and social reforms in 
Bulgaria. The government should adopt severe measures to bring 
the crime rate under control, eliminate crime, and speed up the 
economic and agricultural reforms. The president should 
consolidate his role as head of state and the personification of 
the unity of the nation, as stated in the Constitution. 
  The memorandum is signed by 10 of the 11 parties that are 
members of the Council for Cooperation.

<F P=106> [Report by Svetlana Peeva: "Budget Envisages Almost 13 </F>
Instead of 37 Billion Leva for Army"] 
  [Text] The National Security Commission of the National 
Assembly has learned that the government-proposed military 
budget is negligent. The commission met at the Bulgarian Army 
General Staff on 13 January. 
  The military had requested 37 billion leva for 1994 and 
indicated that they would be satisfied with 22 billion; however, 
their draft budget only envisages 12.7 billion leva. 
  The National Assembly members learned that the Army 
accumulated a debt of 1 billion leva last year. It was even 
necessary to use a part of the emergency rations. The amount 
needed for the Army's everyday operational needs in 1994 has not 
been ensured. 
  If the budget is not amended, the parliament will have to 
bear the responsibility for the consequences, the Army 
leadership declared. An internal subcommission led by Dimitur 
Yonchev will collect data on the situation in the Army and will 
make specific proposals on resolving the problems.

<F P=106> ["Regular" Friday interview with Prime Minister Vladimir </F>
Meciar by editor Peter Toman; place not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Toman] Some political 
observers hold very skeptical views of Visegrad Group prospects. 
How do you see the Visegrad Four future? 
  [Meciar] As far as the cooperation within the Visegrad Four 
is concerned, the year 1993 can be assessed as the year of 
wasted opportunities. The creation of a common market area was 
supposed to have begun in 1992. We have made no headway in this 
respect. Multilateral cooperation has begun to stagnate. The 
building of an infrastructure in the border areas which would 
make it possible to establish communications between and within 
the states is stagnating. There are no programs which would 
outline a specific course of action in developing cooperation in 
the very near future. [passage omitted] 
  The Slovak Republic is exceptionally interested in the 
continual development of Visegrad Group. It is interested in 
the continual development of very effective forms of cooperation 
between Visegrad Four in the spheres where it is, from the 
pragmatic view point, appropriate and essential. In other 
words, this is the development of the economy, trade, transport 
and communications, the coordination of the course of action 
vis-a-vis European Communities. All of this is promising. 
  Naturally, the active development in 1994 will be to a 
certain extent modified by the situation surrounding the 
elections in the Republic of Hungary. Once again we shall be 
awaiting the outcome of these elections. There are concerns on 
our side that (?more time could be wasted) again. 
  Thus it is important for the Slovak Republic. We shall be 
striving for and seeking ways of cooperation. But whether this 
cooperation will actually materialize depends equally on all the 
four partners. 
  [Toman] The Brussels and Prague deliberations have somewhat 
overshadowed the fact that over here, on our political stage, 
developments in the Slovak National Party [SNS] have 
intensified. How do you interpret those conflicts, and above 
all, what consequences for the functioning of the coalition 
government and the stability of our internal political situation 
could they have? 
  [Meciar] What is going on inside the SNS is a matter for 
that 
party alone. But if such developments have an influence on the 
government coalition, then it is not a matter for that party 
alone because, naturally, it concerns the coalition, both in 
parliament and in the government. The nature of these 
developments was determined some time ago. Frequently, rhetoric 
obscured the truth, but we recognized the truth and discussed 
it. There has always been, however, a contradiction between 
what was being said at the negotiating table and what was the 
SNS representative telling the public. Sometimes this even 
included untruths of which he was aware. But it is impossible 
to be in a coalition and at the same time against the coalition. 
The current dispute is not between those who are in favor of 
partnership and cooperation, because we are partners and we do 
not wish to deny their identity anyone. It is between those who 
do not want the coalition and this shared government on the one 
hand, and those who want the coalition and want to preserve the 
shared government on the other. 
  Several facts do surprise me, though. First of all, 
immediately following the signing of the coalition agreement, 
those SNS officials who had contributed to the creation of the 
coalition were attacked, while those who had criticized the 
coalition agreement gained the upper hand. Second, the 
government was joined by officials who did so on the basis of 
the coalition agreement and as a result of having the SNS 
mandate. These very same people are now being accused of career 
ambitions, although they have accepted posts of a lower status 
than they used to enjoy in parliament. 
  Likewise, I am astonished to see that in a process 
resembling 
a kind of purge, party officials or deputies representing the 
party [SNS], are being despatched to the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. Since this is taking place at a 
time when the national-democratic club is being set up, we have 
to ask the question: What about the SNS, has it not been a 
national-democratic party all along? 
  We know a lot about backstage deals and therefore are 
anxious 
to see the results of the SNS deliberations. From our point of 
view, the ideal situation would be if our partner acted in a 
united fashion. As this seems to be impossible, could we at 
least know who is who, please? 
  The situation when one thing is being said in the public and 
something different is being done behind the stage can hardly 
last much longer. 
  [Toman] Critical responses are coming in from HZDS district 
and local assemblies to that part of the New Year address by the 
president of the republic which speaks about the need to set up 
a more broad coalition government. What do you think about this 
proposal? 
  [Meciar] First, the New Year message is usually delivered in 
a festive atmosphere and rounds up the whole nature of the 
festive season. I do not know whether his speech had a 
disturbing effect. However, there was a special section of the 
community where its disturbing effect was felt. 
  It is not commonplace that the president should question the 
government of his own country before the talks of such 
importance, as were the talks with NATO on joining the alliance. 
This sends a very serious signal abroad and it backfires. At 
the same time, in practical politics there cannot be two policy 
lines -- one from the Castle [president's seat] and one 
government policy, because there is only one government and it 
is the government that makes policies. 
  The only reason why the HZDS is far more sensitive to these 
matters is that the president has been holding talks on various 
levels for several months. During these talks he has been 
trying to win the support of the people from the movement and to 
turn them against their own movement's chairman and against 
their own government. 
  As for the broad coalition idea, this is nothing new. After 
all, right from the very beginning our existence in the 
government was based on a close cooperation with the SNS and the 
Party of the Democratic Left [SDL]. As soon as certain possible 
changes started to take shape, we proposed a coalition to the 
Party of the Democratic Left. For me personally the biggest 
disappointment of 1993 was [SDL Chairman] Peter Weiss' statement 
that they [PDL] never took these talks seriously, because we 
[HZDS] have always very seriously and very honestly taken our 
place at the negotiating table. 
  There is, of course, yet another dimension to the forming of 
a coalition. We do not even oppose a coalition with the 
Christian Democratic Party [KDH], or in their own terminology, 
with the part of the Christian Democrats that would like to 
cooperate with us. But [KDH Chairman] Jan Carnogursky sets down 
as a condition for the coalition that the HZDS give up its 
chairman. We do not set this condition to the KDH. But what if 
we did? Does this mean that the HZDS should relinquish its 
leadership only to accommodate Carnogursky. Milan Knazko 
[chairman of the Alliance of the Democrats of the Slovak 
Republic--ADSR] has set down a similar condition. And what club 
does he represent? 
  Discussing our coalition with Egyuetteles is not on, I 
think. 
Our cooperation with the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement 
could have some proper foundations and both of us are trying to 
establish that they exist. And thus, voicing an idea and a 
slogan at the same time not being able to impart a content to 
them and specify in what ways they should be implemented is very 
difficult. Attaching personal dimensions to parties' attitudes 
and differences in policies and pointing out that the one who is 
to blame is Meciar amounts to great simplifications and I cannot 
accept this viewpoint. 
  The HZDS, which supported Mr president in the election by 
giving 74 votes to him, perceives his moves in a far more 
sensitive way, mainly because his moves are directed at breaking 
up the movement. But the movement has been built to provide 
defenses against any external attack and, as such, it is 
defending itself. I think it is a legitimate defense. 
  Given this situation, just consider the action taken against 
[Ivan] Lexa [whose ministerial appointment was blocked by 
President Kovac]. He is threatened with the possibility that 
criminal prosecution could be relaunched against him for an 
offense which was not used even under Husak -- nothing happened 
to Bilak [former member of CPCZ Central Committee], Colotka 
[former Slovak prime minister] -- who were in this situation. 
But here, when a person says publicly what he [Lexa] said at a 
HZDS meeting, criminal proceedings are launched against this 
person and a punishment of deprivation of freedom is looming 
over him and he is being threatened with the confiscation of his 
passport. This does not create a good atmosphere, because Lexa 
enjoyed the trust of the same (?representation) whose trust the 
president sought. [passage omitted] 
  [Toman] The latest opinion polls once again signal the 
deepening political apathy of the population. The fact which is 
not too flattering is that in the assessment of trustworthiness 
of eight frontranking institutions in the state, the government 
found itself in last place. What, in your opinion, is the 
reason for this and how would you like achieve a reversal of 
things in the year that has just began? 
  [Meciar] We were aware of this threat before and that is why 
our last three cabinet sessions in 1993 considered this 
development, and the fact that the government could actually 
drop to the last place. After all, a citizen is continually 
being fed with the information that the government can be blamed 
for everything. The government can be blamed for any silly 
action of any official in Slovakia, it is blamed for each 
businessman who is out of work, is responsible for a hole in the 
road roadworkers failed to mend and so on. What this amounts to 
is that the government is identified with all the bad things in 
Slovakia. This has been achieved by influencing people's 
reasoning and thinking. 
  We are facing a task of exposing what (?the practical) 
responsibility of each official is and, on the other hand, to 
demonstrate the work of the government. I am confident that 
this relationship will be reversed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Peter Boross by unidentified </F>
correspondent; place and date not given; from "The Week" 
program; recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] There are various 
interpretations at home and abroad. After the NATO summit and 
the top level meetings in Prague, does Hungarian diplomacy 
regard the developments as a success or fiasco? 
  [Boross] [passage omitted] There was plenty of pouting in 
the 
foreign and domestic press. However, what happened means 
significantly more. It allows us to hope that if we meet certain 
conditions, the path may lead to NATO and security. 
  [Correspondent] Was this optimism confirmed by personal 
meetings, too, first and foremost, of course, with U.S. 
President Clinton? 
  [Boross] Yes. He is a politician of very cordial voice and 
informal style. The discussion had a pleasant atmosphere and 
was very rich in content. 
  A new element evolved, and it is very important. U.S. 
intentions for Central Europe's economic support were voiced. 
When President Clinton told us he would convene a conference in 
the United States as early as this year to facilitate the 
region's economic development, we learned about an initiative of 
the President that is destined to stimulate U.S. investment 
endeavors. Thus, the clear intention now seems to be to promote 
economic stability. 
  [Correspondent] Together or individually -- it is obviously 
a 
big question in such an economic rise. 
  [Boross] During my talks in Prague I had the opportunity to 
stress to various negotiating partners that, quite peculiarly, 
the forces that shape world politics think very much in terms of 
regions, most of the times not in terms of individual countries, 
but a series of linkable countries, that is regions. 
  However, it is also clear from the statement that joining 
NATO, the progress, rapprochement to NATO, or becoming a NATO 
member are subject to the countries' individual performance. We 
would like to sign the document in Brussels on joining, which, 
we hope, will be followed by a couple of months work to prepare 
a working program. It will presumably include several compulsory 
elements regarding requirements related to the Armed Forces' 
armament, education, and skills, perhaps language knowledge. 
  It shows by itself that at present the political desire that 
we should immediately write a letter and ask for NATO admission 
is absolutely unreal. [passage omitted -- Boross says two years 
ago, when Socialist chief Gyula Horn raised the idea of joining 
NATO, Hungary's application would have been rejected] 
  [Correspondent] Obviously, every proposal is related to 
increasing the country's defensive ability, and in general 
matters regarding the country's stability. Now, after these 
talks, is Hungary in a significantly more favorable situation 
from this viewpoint than it was, let's say, two or three weeks 
[as heard] ago? 
  [Boross] God forbid [ne adja a sors] that we have to test 
how 
NATO would react if some more serious danger threatened us. 
However, I am convinced that this initiative and also its 
textual content means a more favorable security situation to us 
than two or three years ago. However, it does not yet mean 
absolute security; the security that one can achieve with NATO 
membership. 
  [Correspondent] Have these talks between the Visegrad 
countries brought about new tensions or, perhaps, have old ones, 
which have to be settled, been raised? It is a permanent 
problem, question, that the Hungarian Government does not 
eliminate but increases these tensions. I mean by this the 
prime minister's meeting with Prime Minister Meciar where the 
issue of Gabcikovo-Nagymaros [hydroelectric power plant and dam] 
and the minority issue were again raised. 
  [Boross] I have to say that the main emphasis was on 
cooperation at all three talks, including my talks with Mr. 
Meciar. There are problems and we are aware of them. However, 
it was not possible to solve or to make an attempt to solve them 
during this time. In spite of this fact, we have a lot to do in 
the field of economic relations, for example in strengthening 
free trade relations. As soon as I returned home, this free 
trade issue, the question where we really stand in this matter, 
was put on my desk. 
  The Hungarian Government does not worsen these relations. 
However, the Hungarian Government lives with a historic 
situation. A Hungarian Government cannot be indifferent to 
Hungarians living beyond its borders -- if it respected itself 
and called itself a Hungarian Government. The allegation that 
the Hungarian Government took steps that made the situation more 
tense then desirable I consider impossible. We have to take 
exception with those who think that if any kind of atrocity or 
disadvantageous step affected the Hungarian community in a 
neighboring country, the government should stay silent. Well, 
it cannot stay silent. 
  [Correspondent] To what extent will the agreements, which 
have been or will be concluded in the form of agreements in the 
course of talks, influence the relations of the region's 
countries with Ukraine and Russia, the Russian territories. [as 
heard] 
  [Boross] I have to say that the Partnership for Peace 
initiative can be a kind of spiritual familiarization for those 
who have been frightened or received this initiative unfavorably 
or with criticism. Therefore, the fact that here, in this 
region, only endeavors for security, and not preparations 
against the domination of somebody, can be proved by a series of 
facts. 
  Ukrainian and Russian relations are extremely important to 
us. I hope we can soon welcome the Russian prime minister in 
Budapest. And here, in this place, realistically assessing where 
the storm of history has placed us, we have to declare that, 
yes, our orientation is indeed trans-Atlantic from the security 
point of view, but our relations toward the eastern region can 
be described with peaceful intentions, friendly motivations, the 
strengthening of political ties, and the prosperity of the 
economy in a way that, in the current market situation, can be 
really imagined only with a strengthening eastern market. 
  [Correspondent] Should we not bother about the message of 
the 
victorious Russian -- Zhirinovskiy -- sent almost every day that 
we should remain neutral and not to get closer to NATO. 
  [Boross] Well, to be honest, I hear and read different 
things, not only because I do not speak Russian, but for other 
reasons as well. [passage indistinct] The aforementioned 
gentleman has bewildering manifestations. If he said this, I 
have to qualify his manifestations as very immature. However, I 
hope that it cannot be considered as the Russian policy. This 
is a kind of peripheral phenomenon, if there were indeed voices 
like this. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky by Laszlo </F>
Gog; place and date not given: "Geza Jeszenszky on the 
Partnership for Peace Program"] 
  [Text] [Gog] Hungary was among the first to accept the 
U.S. and NATO offer for a partnership for peace and announced 
that, within this framework, Hungary would like to participate 
in bilateral military cooperation with NATO. When do you expect 
from the signing of the peace partnership declaration adopted in 
Brussels? 
  [Jeszenszky] I cannot yet give you a firm answer to this 
question, but it will take place soon. After certain political 
consultations at home, the signing of this cooperation will take 
place soon. The U.S. side plans to send a further delegation to 
Hungary, as well as to the other states, in the near future. 
This is not an international agreement, so it does not need 
parliamentary ratification; however, the government believes it 
important to have the broadest possible political consensus 
behind this. 
  [Gog] The signing of the statement will be followed by the 
bilateral NATO-Hungarian agreement on cooperation, one that 
contains the details of cooperation. What does Hungary plan to 
include in this project? 
  [Jeszenszky] Definitely the framework of concrete 
cooperation, political representation, and participation in the 
activity of the NATO Headquarters. We would also like to 
include something that is there in the Brussels document, namely 
that the goal is full membership and, at the same time, that we 
accept certain obligations. 
  [Gog] Will certain concrete elements of military 
cooperation, such as the organization of military exercises, 
military training, and participation in peacekeeping missions 
also be included in the treaty? 
  [Jeszenszky] Of course. However, some elements of military 
cooperation have already been effected, such as the training of 
Hungarian officers in various NATO countries, as well as the 
broadening of control over airspace. As a UN member, Hungary 
also participates in certain peacekeeping actions, for example 
in Mozambique and Cambodia. When we train in a NATO framework, 
this will also advance the reform of the Hungarian Army. 
  [Gog] All four Visegrad countries have already announced 
their willingness to participate in the cooperation offered 
under the Partnership for Peace program. In your opinion, in 
what way are President Clinton's visit and discussions in Prague 
important? 
  [Jeszenszky] Actually, exactly what NATO was offering only 
transpired on Monday [10 January]. This is an American proposal 
and it had to be accepted by NATO. The United States played an 
important and positive role in making the NATO summit accept 
this rich cooperation program after all and, in this way, opened 
a possible venue. It was not their goal in Prague to convince 
us that this peace partnership is good for us and that it 
provides adequate security, and it was not our goal to convince 
them that this should be better and that they should give as 
much as possible; instead, we talked of ways in which the 
stability of Hungary and its neighbors could be advanced, for 
example in economic matters, because these matters are very 
important from the viewpoint of security.

  [Text] Tomorrow the Polish Government will adopt a final 
view on Poland's participation in the American Partnership for 
Peace program. During U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to 
Russia, Boris Yeltsin came out for Russia's full participation 
in the program. According to President Yeltsin, it is possible 
for Russia to join NATO, but only together with all former 
allies of the East Bloc. 
  We asked Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk whether 
possible access to NATO by Russia would not undermine Western 
security guarantees to our country. 
  [Begin Kolodziejczyk recording] Nobody is going to give full 
guarantees. We have to strive after them, this is obvious. The 
statements by President Yeltsin, however, well, they vary in 
tone and they are not always consistent. 
  Still, I think that Clinton achieved a lot. If Yeltsin 
accepts the participation in the Partnership for Peace, it means 
that we can feel a little safer -- if these intentions are 
genuine. No security system without Russia or, even worse, 
against Russia would be either permanent or safe. That is why I 
receive the statement favorably. We will see how it is going to 
look in practice. [end recording]

  [Text] Hamburg (DDP/ADN) -- Poland will not accept the NATO 
decision not to allow members of the former Warsaw Pact join the 
organization, Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski told 
the news magazine DER SPIEGEL. His country will do all it can 
to "become a member." However, with regard to "Russia's 
encirclement phobia," nothing will be undertaken that would harm 
Moscow's interests. If Russia continues on its way to 
democracy, Olechowski said, the "resistance against our 
membership" will fade. Otherwise the West will have to admit 
Poland into the defense alliance despite a Russian veto. There 
is "no alternative" to this, the Polish foreign minister 
stressed.

  [Text] Warsaw, 14 Jan -- According to Andrzej Olechowski 
and Geza Jeszenszky, foreign ministers of Poland and Hungary, it 
is hard to imagine relations between both states being better 
than to date. In their view, Polish-Hungarian friendship can 
become an "engine" of cooperation in the Visegrad Group. 
  After talks today in the Foreign Ministry, Olechowski said 
that the excellent Polish-Hungarian political contacts can also 
be translated into economic relations. In the near future, 
businessmen of both states will prepare a report on 
possibilities for expanding economic cooperation. 
  The Polish and Hungarian foreign ministers also signed an 
agreement on cooperation between their departments, including 
cooperation between ambassadors of Poland and Hungary in third 
countries.

<F P=106> [Report by M.D.Z.: "Pirates' Kingdom Is Collapsing"] </F>
  [Text] With two abstentions, the Senate adopted the 
"Copyright Law"; it made several amendments which, among others, 
limit a producer's rights to works. 
  The copyright bill, classified as urgent, was forwarded to 
the Sejm on 23 November 1994. Such a mode of proceedings was 
criticized by Zbigniew Romaszewski: "Urgent proceedings make it 
practically impossible for the Senate to influence this law," 
said Romaszewski. The "Solidarity" senator said that the 
producer's rights were too broad and proposed that the period in 
which they are binding be shortened from 10 to five years, which 
the chamber did (there was no vote against it), after the 
committees had issued positive opinions. It adopted the law, 
despite the negative stand by Deputy Minister of Culture Piotr 
Lukasiewicz, who explained that "the producer is not only a fat 
capitalist with a cigar in his mouth, but also the one who 
organizes the process of creating work." 
  The new Copyright Law envisions absolution for owners of 
computer software which they obtained, in violation of the law, 
before the effective date of this law. "What would we look like 
if in an agreement with the United States, we decided that as 
soon as the agreement comes into effect, all automobiles stolen 
in the United States will be the legal property of the people 
who bought them?" protested Piotr L. Andrzejewski, on behalf of 
the Club of the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union 
"Solidarity." "The theft of computer software and the theft of 
automobiles are two entirely different things; a person who 
obtained given software in a non- prohibited manner cannot be 
told not to use it," argued Senator Jan Orzechowski of the 
Polish Peasant Party; the majority of the senators agreed with 
his view. 
  "Poland is believed to be a real paradise for pirates. The 
production and sale of those people's products is a large sector 
of the economy; however, it is in fact like a tumor. Due to the 
fact that this sector exists, everyone is losing, except the 
pirates themselves," said Piotr Lukasiewicz, undersecretary of 
state in the Ministry of Culture and Art; he was for maintaining 
the absolution concerning stolen software. 
  Among the proposals that the senators turned down was also 
prolonging vacation legis [preceding two words in Latin] from 
three to six months from the day the law is passed -- "to give 
appropriate establishments the time to become familiar with it." 
  It was agreed that it will be lawful to perform literary, 
musical, and literary-musical works in public, free of charge 
("if this is not done with a view to making a profit"), and to 
distribute them, without the author's permission, for "didactic 
and scientific purposes." 
  The senators decided that a court of law must state the 
forfeiture of the "unlawfully manufactured specimens of works"; 
it may also, but is not obliged by the law, to state the 
forfeiture of the objects by means of which the offense was 
committed. 
  Solidarity senators expressed doubts of a rather general 
nature. Piotr L. Andrzejewski stated that the Copyright Law 
violates the constitutional right to associate and introduces a 
"Stalinist criterion of the warranty of the right 
administration," which will be decided by the governmental 
administration. 
  On Thursday [13 January], the Sejm also adopted amendments 
to 
the Geological and Mining Law.

  [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy will arrive in Poland on 28 
January accompanied by a 10-person delegation, Janusz 
Bryczkowski, head of the Samoobrona [Self-Defense] National 
Front, who is currently in Moscow, has announced. 
  [Correspondent Iwona Parchimowicz; identified by caption] 
The visit will last two to three days. It will most certainly 
take place on Saturday and Sunday, as there are no meetings of 
the State Duma then. It will depend on the situation in the 
parliament whether the visit will be extended to Monday, 31 
January. The Grunwald battlefields, Krakow, and Auschwitz are 
still on the program of the visit. Zhirinovskiy's colleague has 
also mentioned a visit to some large enterprise, preferably an 
arms industry enterprise. 
  Bryczkowski is convinced that several important Polish 
politicians would like to meet Zhirinovskiy in the hope of 
getting closer acquainted with this Russian marvel. The 
personal protection of the Moscow guest is Bryczkowski's 
greatest concern. Most probably he will hire professionals from 
the antiterrorist brigade operating at Okecie airport. Because 
of the long route of the visit and a short stay, the guests will 
travel in Poland by helicopter.

  [Text] Bijeljina, 17 Jan (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the republic of Srpska, stated in Bijeljina this 
evening that the assembly of the republic of Srpska today had 
adopted a decision to permit the exchange of UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] troops in Srebrenica with the same number of 
Dutch soldiers armed with the same weapons, adding that this 
operation could be carried out as early as tomorrow in 
cooperation with the general staff of the army of the republic 
of Srpska. Speaking about attempts to concoct reasons for 
issuing threats to the Serbs, Karadzic added that, as regards 
Tuzla, it was obvious that those who were advocating the opening 
of the airport were trying to prolong the war, as this was yet 
another way to help the Muslims obtain weapons. 
  There is no reason why all airports in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
should not be opened, but not before a peace agreement has been 
signed, because the airports would be abused for military 
purposes, Karadzic said. Karadzic held a news conference after 
the republic of Srpska assembly wound up its session today at 
which it adopted a platform for tomorrow's round of negotiations 
in Geneva. Details of the platform have not been disclosed. 
Karadzic stressed that the Serbs had worked out options that 
would be used to achieve their objectives, saying that he did 
not expect any essential changes in the Muslim side's further 
rejection of the peace plan. Karadzic recalled that the Muslims 
were not forced to change anything; they were not under pressure 
from the international community. Because all the threats were 
directed towards the Serbs, the Muslims were encouraged to 
continue the war. Karadzic said that the international 
community was prolonging the war in Bosnia by maintaining 
sanctions and issuing threats to the Serbs. 
  It is absolutely certain that the Muslims would accept peace 
if the international community were to exert the same pressure 
on all three sides and stop threatening the Serbs and if it 
lifted sanctions against the Serbs, in which case the Muslims 
would clearly realize peace is more beneficial to them than war, 
Karadzic said. Karadzic said that although Serbians were 
already used to threats, they nevertheless took all threats very 
seriously: "These are not some minor forces but the world's 
largest military organization." 
  He noted that "almost everything the international community 
has done so far in the area of the former Yugoslavia was 
irrational and irresponsible." He also stressed that he 
believed that reason would prevail. He added that it was the 
ultimate paradox that small nations like the Serbs could be such 
a threat to Western national interests that such a huge force 
might be deployed. The Serbian delegation will neither act nor 
take decisions under pressure, Karadzic emphasized. 
  Replying to a question about his mood on his way to Geneva, 
Karadzic said he was pessimistic as regards the international 
community's intensions to support peace. The president of the 
people's assembly of the republic of Srpska, Momcilo Krajisnik, 
said that in the course of the debate on the platform, the 
deputies had demanded that the coming period and the events that 
might follow be taken seriously, since the Muslims were making 
serious preparations for war. He said certain territorial 
concessions had been criticized and that the deputies maintained 
these concessions were seriously damaging to the republic of 
Srpska. 
  Expressing regret at not being able to talk about the 
platform because he was duty-bound not to by the assembly's 
decision, Krajisnik added that this document includes an 
invitation to talks and provides every possibility of satisfying 
the interests of all three sides.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 17 Jan (TANJUG) -- The [Bosnian Serb] 
assembly will discuss the latest situation created after the 
Muslims rejected the plan which offers them 33.3 percent of 
[Bosnian] territory and a "reasonable way to gain access to the 
river Sava, and we now have to see which way to proceed now", 
Republic of Srpska [RS] president Radovan Karadzic told TANJUG 
today. 
  According to him, the Muslim representatives rejected the 
33.3 percent of the territory offered to them -- the percentage 
the international community has insisted on -- in the talks 
Bosnian Serb assembly president Momcilo Krajisnik held with them 
at Sarajevo airport on Saturday [16 January]. 
  "The most important thing is that we met the demand by the 
international community, which requested 30 percent. The 
Muslims then demanded 33 percent. The international community 
supported that demand. We found even the additional 3 percent, 
and then the Muslims rejected that too," Karadzic recalled 
before today's session of the Bosnian Serb assembly in Bijeljina. 
  "The war is still going on. People are still getting killed, 
and we have made many concessions precisely to end the war and 
the killing and to have peace immediately," the RS president 
said. "Since this has not happened, we have to decide today 
which path to take in the future."

  [Text] This evening, the assembly of the republic of 
Srpska meeting in Bijeljina ended its discussion on the platform 
of the Serbian delegation for the peace talks in Geneva tomorrow 
[18 January]. At the end of the session, Nikola Koljevic, vice 
president of the republic of Srpska, made a statement for 
Belgrade Radio's special correspondent Milorad Denda: 
  [Denda] Professor Koljevic, what did today's session of the 
assembly of the Serbian Republic conclude? 
  [Koljevic] Today's session on the platform for the peace 
agreement concluded that the delegation of the republic of 
Srpska will once again offer in Geneva what the Serbian side has 
been asked to offer in the past, namely territorial concessions, 
and the administration of the district of Sarajevo, under 
specific conditions agreed upon during the negotiations. 
However, considering the public statements by the Sarajevo 
Presidency, especially by Messrs. Izetbegovic and Ganic, the 
assembly has adopted another platform in case the Muslim side 
does not accept the proffered peace agreement. 
  This platform will be revealed, that is presented, in Geneva 
tomorrow, and the general conclusion, if I may say so, is 
unanimous and undivided that if the Muslim side does not want 
the agreement on these bases, the representatives of the 
republic of Srpska will take a very specific and definitive 
stand that will lead toward the affirmation of the republic of 
Srpska on completely new bases. 
  [Denda] Can you be more specific about these new bases? 
  [Koljevic] These bases will be discussed, or rather the 
platform itself deals with these bases. The most important 
element for these bases is that we will proceed with the demand 
for a cease-fire and the de facto situation on the ground.

  [Text] At the session of the Presidency of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina held 14 January 1994 a proposed agreement was 
discussed on establishing lasting and overall peace between the 
Croatian and Bosniak-Muslim people in the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the foundations for future common life, 
offered by the Croatian side at the talks in Bonn on 9 January. 
  The Presidency supported the initiative as well as all 
efforts aimed at achieving a lasting peace, friendship and life 
together of the Croatian and Bosniak-Muslim people. The 
Presidency is also of the opinion that the life together of and 
the friendship among all the three peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
is of historic interest and that the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, as a multinational community, is interested 
in cooperation with the neighboring countries. 
  As regards the relations between the Croatian and 
Bosniak-Muslim people--they have historic foundations and are 
based on territorial links, economic, cultural closeness, and 
joint strategic interests, also bearing in mind the fact that 
these two peoples and states are under threat from the same 
aggressor. This is why the Presidency is determined to continue 
with the efforts as soon as possible to halt the tragic conflict 
between the Croats and Bosniak-Muslims, which is primarily a 
consequence of the greater Serbian aggression and to find such 
political and system solutions which would, instead of allowing 
the conflict, stimulate friendship, cooperation and even 
integration processes which would benefit our peoples and states. 
  Some parts of the [proposed] agreement set such objectives 
and the Presidency supports them. Unfortunately, the agreement 
as a whole, in its proposed form, cannot be accepted for several 
principled reasons. First, an agreement cannot be signed by 
peoples, but by internationally recognized subjects. In this 
case the subjects of the international public law are the states 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, as the internationally 
recognized states and UN members. Since these two states have 
recognized each other, signing the agreement on behalf of the 
Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna is not legally valid or possible, 
nor is it politically acceptable. It implies derecognition of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina by the Republic of Croatia, with all negative 
consequences stemming from it. 
  Second, the agreement's preamble does not mention the third 
nation, that is the Serbian nation, without which there is no 
overall and just solution and whose position must also be taken 
into consideration. 
  Third, the preamble says that the parties to the agreement 
will give personal guarantees for the implementation of the 
agreement, which is legally invalid in a case of an 
international agreement between two sovereign, internationally 
recognized states. A shortcoming of the [proposed] agreement is 
also that it does not state which international legal subject 
will guarantee its implementation. 
  Four, the [proposed] agreement uses the terminological names 
: the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and the Muslim-Bosniak 
republic, which define in advance the names and solutions which 
are not in accordance with the terminology of the so-called 
Geneva package -- for example: the republic with the majority 
Croatian population. 
  Five, as regards a possible secession and the end of the 
existence of the Union of the Republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
the formulations differ significantly from those which were 
agreed on and accepted in principle at the Geneva talks. The 
constitutional agreement on the formation of a union of the 
republics does not envisage the possibility of a union of two 
republics. The proposed agreement does not respect the agreed 
conditions nor the procedure in case of a possible secession 
from or disintegration of the union, nor the consequences 
envisaged in these situations. In such a situation it is 
particularly important that the republic with the majority 
Bosniak-Muslim people takes over the Neum municipality, the area 
of Brcko, and the international-legal status and continuity of 
the internationally recognized Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Six, the solutions which the agreement proposes for Mostar 
and Neum are not in accordance with what was agreed onboard 
Invincible, nor with the solutions which were agreed in 
principle during the Geneva peace process. 
  Seven, many articles of the agreement contain legal 
shortcomings, political inconsistence and terminological 
imprecision, and some articles contradict some other ones--[for 
example] the definition of the status of Mostar, Neum and the 
free zones in the [Croatian Adriatic] ports of Ploce and Rijeka, 
the imprecision in defining the envisaged borders between the 
two future republics, and the leaving out of the third, Serbian 
side, and the problem of the occupied territory etc. 
  For all these reasons, and with the objective of using 
constructively the [Croatian] initiative to find solutions which 
would bring about peace and friendly cooperation between the two 
peoples and states the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina has 
decided: 
  First, to relaunch the initiative to establish confederal 
relations between the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the 
Republic of Croatia, as two sovereign and internationally 
recognized states. The presidency also reiterates its proposal 
that in the parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina controlled by the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the HVO [Croat Defense Council] a 
united constitutional and legal system be promptly established. 
It would be based on the principles of full national equality 
and parliamentary democracy. Local authorities would be based on 
proportional representation, according to the population census 
of 1991. Domination by the majority population would be 
eliminated by the use of parity and consensus when deciding on 
most important issues. Other areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina would 
be treated as occupied territories and solutions for them would 
be sought within a peace process and a process of a democratic 
transformation within the Serbian national corps. 
Decentralization of the state authorities and the internal 
regionalization of the republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina would not 
be resolved through the confederal agreement. 
  To implement this initiative the Presidency of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina proposes that a joint interstate commission 
be formed promptly to examine all elements of the future 
confederation. Some foundations for it have already been 
defined in article 15, part two of the agreement [proposed by 
the Croats]. 
  Until the entire confederal agreement between the two states 
is finalized the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina expresses 
willingness to examine all proposals related to the halting of 
the war confrontations, establishing peace and promoting life 
together both in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the Republic of 
Croatia, the reply of the Bosnia-Herzegovina presidency to the 
agreement proposed by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman says in 
its conclusion.

  [Text] [Announcer] Bosnia-Herzegovina's Foreign Minister 
Irfan Ljubljankic, was the guest at a meeting today of the 
Council of the Congress of Bosniak-Muslim Intellectuals. He 
spoke about the position and stances of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
delegation ahead of the next round of Geneva talks. [Name 
indistinct] has the report. 
  [Correspondent] At today's discussion of peace talks at the 
Council of the Congress of Bosniak-Muslim Intellectuals, 
Minister Ljubljankic spoke, among other things, about elements 
of our position before the next round of Geneva talks, which was 
defined in the past few days. 
  [Ljubljankic] "As you know, in Bonn we discussed the 
Croatian 
state's offer that is -- from the legal and political point of 
view -- useless. Starting from its heading: A contractual 
agreement, and so on via the preamble and the articles 
explaining the agreement -- we reached the conclusion that I 
have just said: The document is useless. 
  The document basically contains an offer for a confederation 
between Croatia -- enlarged by so-called Herceg-Bosna -- and 
some future Bosniak-Muslim republic as it is defined in the 
document." 
  [Correspondent] What forced the Croatian leadership to take 
this step? Minister Ljubljankic believes that it was Croatia's 
stained reputation on the international scene, as well as the 
sharp criticism of Tudjman's policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
voiced in Croatia itself. 
  What will be our reply? The working group, set up at the 
prime minister's request and which included Minister 
Ljubljankic, has prepared draft proposals, which were yesterday 
discussed at the sessions of the Bosnia-Herzegovina presidency 
and the government. 
  [Ljubljankic] "We will submit a new proposal to the Croatian 
side on a confederal agreement between Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina -- Bosnia-Herzegovina meaning the territory 
held by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army -- the Croatian side refers 
to it as the Muslim army -- and Herceg-Bosna, because the 
remaining territory will be considered as temporarily occupied. 
This draft document will state that the power would be based on 
the principle of parity between Croats and Muslims and that the 
two state working groups or commissions will work on perfecting 
and finding a final definition of this [word indistinct]." 
  [Correspondent] During his recent visit to Sarajevo, former 
French President Giscard d'Estaing suggested to President 
Izetbegovic to bypass Geneva in some way and bring in new 
elements to the talks, Ljubljankic said and added: 
  [Ljubljankic] "We think that the time has come to do 
something like this because Geneva, I have recently said it on 
radio, has become a caricature. There is always something being 
added, we have constantly been adding something to the 
proposals. One side would be dissatisfied with something and it 
would add an element; finally the whole project became a 
caricature [words indistinct] I think that these things should 
be changed and that the UN Security Council should take over. 
Given the existing status quo it is better that the UN Security 
Council supervises the situation in Bosnia than at the 
Conference on Former Yugoslavia." 
  [Correspondent] The largest part of the public abroad 
supports the official Bosnia-Herzegovina authorities, and so do 
many former politicians whose opinion is still important in the 
world. Active foreign politicians however, favor a division of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the equation of guilt and so on. Minister 
Ljubljankic will tell us why that is so. 
  [Ljubljankic] "I have only one answer: Because it is the 
Muslims who live in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Why are they afraid of 
Bosnian Muslims (?when) the Bosnian Muslims are also Europeans? 
They are surprised that if we have already accepted all the 
benefits of European culture, and if we live according to the 
European cultural pattern, we are still Muslims. (?Is this) a 
way for Islam eventually to come to Europe as an idea, not only 
as a form, as a shadow of something historical and traditional, 
but also as an idea to take Europe, to encompass it, to fulfill 
the emptiness of the European man with a new idea. 
  It is my deep conviction that this is the reason why they 
are 
afraid. What is the answer to this? We must find one together. 
I believe that we should remain what we are and remain in 
Europe."

  [Text] Sarajevo, Jan 16 (AFP) -- The UN-mediated Bosnia 
peace process should be scrapped if Tuesday's [18 January] talks 
in Geneva fail said Bosnian premier Haris Silajdzic, as his 
Moslem-led government and rebel Serbs expressed pessimism over 
prospects for reaching agreement. 
  "A conference which does not bear fruit should cease to 
exist," Siladjzic said Sunday, refering to the UN conference on 
the former Yugoslavia which has led peace negotiations over 
Bosnia-Herzegovina with the European Community. "Under these 
conditions the Bosnian issue should be sent back to the Security 
Council, which would have to assume responsibility for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina," he added. Silajdzic threatened to boycott 
the Geneva talks if "Bosnian civilians continue to be killed," 
adding "we should bring the Europeans, the Americans and the 
Russians to negotiate in Sarajevo, under shell fire." 
  The Bosnian premier, who held talks Saturday with Momcilo 
Krajisnik, speaker of the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament, 
said he was "not optimistic" that a settlement of the 
21-month-old war could be reached. "We reached no political 
agreement," said Silajdzic, adding that "I wonder whether there 
will be any progress in Geneva." [passage omitted] 
  In Athens, Bosnia mediators Thorvald Stoltenberg and Lord 
Owen held talks with Greek Foreign Minister Carolos Papoulias, 
whose country currently holds the EC's rotating presidency. 
Owen said the prospects for a settlement in Geneva were not 
good given the intensification of fighting in Bosnia. 
Stoltenberg said Greece, which is close to the Serbs, fellow 
Orthodox Christians, had not officially presented a new peace 
initiative but had offered "an idea".

  [Text] [Announcer] After a month's break, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic had a meeting 
with Momcilo Krajisnik [president of the Bosnian Serb assembly] 
at Sarajevo airport. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent] Mr Prime Minister, which 
issues did you discuss today? 
  [Silajdzic] We discussed political issues, electricity and 
gas supplies and prisoner exchanges. 
  [Correspondent] What did you agree to? 
  [Silajdzic] Let us begin with easier issues. Concerning 
electricity supply, we agreed to repair the power line between 
Sarajevo and Buca Potok. Repair teams have tried to go out to 
do the repairs four times, but the Serb side did not allow them 
to do anything. However, it was said this time that they would 
allow it. We will see. 
  It is important for both sides to respect their mutual 
interests [words indistinct]. Concerning the exchange of 
prisoners, the big problem is that we are not sure that the 
number of prisoners registered by the Red Cross is correct. We 
think that there are prisoners [words indistinct] 
  Therefore, I think that a partial exchange of prisoners is 
possible, which means that we will exchange as many prisoners as 
possible, but that an exchange according to the all-for-all 
principle -- according to Red Cross lists -- is not possible for 
the time being because we think that this would not be an 
all-for-all exchange. We believe that the Red Cross has not 
registered all prisoners. 
  The gas supplies were interrupted yesterday. I hope that we 
solved that problem too, and that this will not happen in the 
future. 
  Concerning political issues, I must say that we met after a 
long time, but there are no results, no changes. Our positions 
have remained unchanged. We will meet in Geneva soon. I cannot 
say whether any progress will be made there. Both sides want 
peace, at least judging by statements. However, we do not want 
the peace which is being offered to us, which is unacceptable. 
I do not know whether any progress in that respect will be 
made. I also must say that our side stressed the problem of 
bombing the city [Sarajevo], and the actions taken despite 
promises that they would not be taken in other parts of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, I must say that the other side 
voiced the same complaints concerning the territories under 
occupation. [passage indistinct] [end recording]

  [Text] Bosnian Croat leader Mate Boban was ousted from 
power today. According to the Croatian Government, he will not 
take part in the Geneva peace negotiations for Bosnia any more. 
Boban's removal from office appears to be connected with the 
Croats' military defeats in central Bosnia.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, 17 Jan (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the republic of Srpska, today issue an order to all 
subordinate commands and members of the republic of Srpska army 
strictly to refrain, as always before, from engaging in any 
military activities against UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] and 
other international organizations. 
  The order, issued ahead of the new round of Geneva 
negotiations on former Bosnia-Herzegovina, is one more measure 
of precaution in order to reduce to the minimum possible 
manipulations, imputations, and accusations at the expense of 
the republic of Srpska army, that it allegedly imperils members 
of the international organizations in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
sources close to the republic of Srpska leadership believe. 
  The Serbian side has so far been exceptionally cooperative 
with international organizations, but it has often been accused 
of putting humanitarian missions in jeopardy, despite the fact 
that it has never engaged in military actions against members of 
the international organizations, the sources say. [passage 
omitted] 
  With a view to preventing any undesirable incidents with 
international organizations, Karadzic issued a strict ban on all 
military activities in the direction of Sarajevo airport 
directed against any aircraft landing at the airport, any points 
of deployment and convoys belonging to UNPROFOR, the UNHCR, the 
International Committee of the Red Cross, and other humanitarian 
organizations. 
  President Karadzic ordered that all UNPROFOR convoys, 
military observers, and convoys belonging to international 
humanitarian organizations, that have obtained valid permission 
to move around in the territory of the republic of Srpska, be 
provided with full protection and unhindered movement, with 
planned and necessary inspection, and that "a completely fair 
and professional attitude" be taken toward representatives of 
all these organizations. 
  He also ordered that all controversial issues arising with 
UNPROFOR representatives and military observers be dealt with 
exclusively through corps commands and the main headquarters of 
the republic of Srpska army, while disputes with international 
humanitarian organizations are to be dealt with through the 
government's coordinating body, a statement dispatched from the 
office of republic of Srpska president Radovan Karadzic says.

  [Text] Zagreb, Jan 14 (TANJUG) -- Prime minister of the 
Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna Jadranko Prlic said that the 
Bosnian Croat state will join neighbouring Croatia if the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina breaks up. 
  In a statement to the Split weekly NEDELJNA DALMACIJA Prlic 
said that Bosnia-Herzegovina can only survive as a union of the 
republics of the three constituent nations -- Moslems Serbs and 
Croats, and that if such a state is formed Herceg-Bosna would 
not secede. Asked if Herceg-Bosna and the republic of Bosnian 
Serbs (RS) would recognize each other Prlic said that this would 
automatically take place if the union is formed for it provides 
for the existence of three mutually recognized republics. 
  Even though the Bosnian Croats and the Bosnian Serbs assured 
one third of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina the Moslems 
asked for at the last round of peace talks in Geneva and 
Brussels last month, the Moslems again turned down the plan 
saying that they were dissatisfied with the quality of the 
territories. 
  What the Bosnian Moslem leadership wants is a 
Moslem-dominated unitary Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was confirmed 
Wednesday by Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic who said 
that the Moslems have to fight for a united Bosnia and the 
preservation of Islam there and called for new military 
operations. He also stressed that his troops were now 200,000 
strong and that things were now different. 
  The war in Bosnia-Herzegovina broke out in April 1992 
because 
Izetbegovic insisted on a unitary state, which was first 
rejected by the Bosnian Serbs and later by the Bosnian Croats, 
who declared their own states within the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, Jan 14 (AFP) -- Aircraft, believed to 
Croatian, have bombed the central Bosnian towns of Vitez and 
Novi Travnik in defiance of a UN flight ban over the war-torn 
state, UN Protection Force spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Bill 
Aikman said Friday. [passage omitted] "Since the rockets fell 
in areas controlled by the Bosnian Army, it appears that the 
raids came from the other side," he said. Aikman said the 
attacks had not been confirmed by either the UN or NATO, but 
that the two air raids had been witnessed by UN forces on the 
ground. [passage omitted] 
  David Owen, the European Community's negotiator in the 
Bosnian conflict, said "a very substantial part" of the Croatian 
Army was operating in Bosnia and called on the international 
community "to react more firmly." Geneva conference spokesman 
John Mills refused to comment on the raids Friday [14 January]. 
  A Bosnian Croat HVO spokesman in Mostar said he did not know 
to whom the helicopters belonged. 
  "All I know is that these past few days Moslem forces have 
overflown Mostar, the Neretva river and Vitez," spokesman Veso 
Vegar said. "We suppose that the helicopters seen yesterday were 
Moslem, since the Serbs fired on them." [passage omitted] 
  In the meantime, two people were killed and 23 wounded by 
shelling in Sarajevo Friday, hospital officials said.

  [Text] The HVO [Croatian Defense Council] also reports that 
Serbs and Muslims are fighting around Novi Travnik. Since early 
this morning artillery explosions were heard on parts of the 
Novi Travnik and Travnik fronts in what is most likely a battle 
between Serbian and Muslim armies. However, the Muslim army did 
aim small arms fire onto parts of the Travnik front that are 
under HVO control. Muslim snipers are also active in Mostar as 
well. There are no reports of casualties.

  [Text] This morning, the Serbian aggressor again started 
shelling Srebrenica. The regions of (?Lihtari) and Vranik were 
shelled from the direction of Bratunac, while the residential 
areas of the town were shelled from Krvavac. One civilian was 
killed and 11 seriously wounded. This was announced by the War 
Presidency of the Srebrenica commune. 
  At about 1230, the aggressor shelled the Suceska area from 
the direction of Milici. After the shelling of all (?lines), 
the aggressor fired with anti-aircraft machine guns, guns, and 
other infantry weapons. Members of UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] in our town can confirm this attack. It has been proven 
once again that Srebrenica is not protected according to the 
provisions of the Security Council Resolutions 819 and 824. 
This was stated in a communique issued by the Srebrenica War 
Presidency. 
  Because of this, the Srebrenica War Presidency appeals once 
again to the Presidency and the Government of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as the General Staff of the Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and UNPROFOR to require the aggressor 
strictly to observe the provisions of the agreement on the 
demilitarization of Srebrenica.

  [Excerpt] Today, the Muslim army stepped up artillery and 
infantry attack on Novi Travnik and Busovaca in central Bosnia. 
The Croat Defense Council [HVO] has heavily defeated the Muslim 
army. Zdenko Vranjes reporting for Croatian Radio from 
Medjugorje. 
  In the course of heavy fighting in the Sofe area near Vitez, 
HVO formations have managed to recapture trenches lost in recent 
fighting. As the HVO Vitez brigade reports, a large number of 
dead Muslim soldiers have been left behind in this area 
following three days of fierce fighting. The HVO will not let 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] enter this area and inspect the 
site unless the Muslim side enables the peace force to launch an 
inquiry in Krizancevo Selo and Buhine Kuce, the Vitez brigade 
has announced. 
  The Muslim army today continued attacking other villages, 
too, near Vitez-Lazine and Buhine Kuce in particular. The 
Muslim army's advance has been checked in this area, too.

<F P=106> [Report by Hajrudin Sermic] </F>
  [Excerpt] The residents of Maglaj have been deprived of 
yet another urgently needed convoy of food and medicine. Eight 
UNHCR trucks arrived, carrying everything but food. The 
authorities of the aggressor 111th HVO [Croatian Defense 
Council] Brigade have been blackmailing our side by insisting 
that, before the [food] convoy enters the town, their 34 
fighters be immediately exchanged for more than 100 of our 
civilians, mainly sick and exhausted women, children, and 
elderly people, who have been in the hands of these criminals 
for seven months. 
  Previous convoys for Maglaj were sent back. Once because 
they did not have a permit from the Serbian authorities, another 
time because of the Croatian authorities, a third time because 
they were allegedly shot at, and now because of this exchange. 
Whether accidentally or not, Larry Hollingworth is involved in 
this dirty matter. He came to Maglaj without the convoy at 0930 
yesterday to tell the state and military leadership of Maglaj 
about the HVO's demands. 
  Mr. Hollingworth returned to Zepce, where he is not being 
allowed to take the urgently needed food and medicines. Vinko 
Ivesic, representative of the HVO commission for exchange, and 
Delaj Krnic, president of our commission, got in touch at 1700. 
The HVO then revealed its real face. Everything is now crystal 
clear. They want to get their fighters and ethnically cleanse 
occupied Zepce of Muslims. They have said loud and clear that 
they do not care much for their fighters, that they will expel 
all 860 Muslims to Maglaj, and that they will not allow any 
convoys to get through in the future, as has been the case so 
far. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Zagreb, Jan 15 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Croat 
commander General Ante Roso said on Saturday [15 January] he had 
ordered his troops to bomb, if neccesary, the explosives factory 
in Vitez which has been the target of fierce Moslem attacks in 
the pasts few days. Vowing not to allow the enemy to take 
control of the factory, General Roso said in a statement 
broadcast on Zagreb television that the Moslems were fiercely 
attacking Vitez and Novi Travnik, but that the local Croat 
troops were successfully yielding [as received] to the pressure. 
  Commenting on the situation in central Bosnia, he said the 
fiercest Croat-Moslem fighting had been reported in the Lasva 
river valley. 
  The Bosnian Croat commander also said he had not accepted or 
signed any ceasefire at the latest round of talks with Bosnian 
Moslem commander Rasim Delic, noting that comprehensive 
political documents were needed for such an agreement. [passage

area in which we are now was in Muslim hands yesterday. Today 
this is not the case. 
  [Zlatan Mijo Jelic, commander of the HVO in Mostar] Yes, as 
of today, this part of the city is in HVO hands. Only 10 meters 
[m] away from us you can see a building held by the Muslim Army. 
It is only a question of time before the HVO will take this 
building too. The demarcation line between us is currently 
between five and 10m. The Muslim army tried to push the front 
line into our territory. 
  Members of the HVO's First Storm Battalion initially 
repelled 
the Muslim Army attack and then launched a counterattack, 
shifting the front line around Santic Street [main front line in 
the city center is parallel with Santic Street] and capturing a 
significant Muslim stronghold in the [nearby] kindergarten and 
five to six other well-fortified buildings. We pushed the front 
line about 100m forward, toward the Neretva [river, Muslims 
control entire left bank and part of right bank] [passage

  [Text] Belgrade, Jan 16 (TANJUG) -- Fierce inter-Moslem 
fighting continues in the autonomous province of western Bosnia 
(APWB) between supporters of provincial leader Fikret Abdic and 
forces loyal to Bosnian Moslem hardline leader Alija 
Izetbegovic. Although Izetbegovic's troops are attacking 
western Bosnia from all weapons at their disposal, the western 
Bosnia defence lines have remained intact, the local news agency 
ZBIA reports on Sunday and adds that there are casualties on 
both sides. Strongly opposed to the proclamation of autonomy of 
western Bosnia four months ago, Izetbegovic has ordered troops 
loyal to him to restore his rule there by force. 
  Bosnian Serb military sources say that Moslems and Croats 
are 
mercilessly fighting each other along the Lasva, Rama and 
Neretva rivers in central and southern Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 
fiercest fighting has been reported in the areas of Vitez, Novi 
Travnik and Busovaca in central Bosnia, and at Blagaj near 
Mostar in Herzegovina, with each side suffering heavy 
casualties. Serb military sources say that no major changes 
have been reported on the Moslem-Croat frontline. 
  The Zagreb-based Croatian radio confirms reports about major 
fighting near Novi Travnik on Saturday, where it says Moslems 
shelled Croat positions. The same source reports that ten Croat 
refugees, fleeing before the Moslem terror in Bugojno in central 
Bosnia, arrived to the Croat town of Livno in the south-west by 
passing through Serb-held Kupres. The refugees say that about 
3,000 Croats and 500 Serbs are still detained in Bugojno which 
the Moslems took over from the Croats last autumn.

  [Text] Petrovac, Jan 14 (TANJUG) -- Fierce intra-Moslem 
clashes between forces of the radical Bosnian Moslem leader 
Alija Izetbegovic and his rival Fikret Abdic continue Friday [14 
January] on all fronts in western Bosnia while Izetbegovic 
terrorist groups are trying lo arrest Abdic. 
  Under Abdic's leadership Moslems from the Cazin Krajina 
declared the autonomous province of western Bosnia in September 
last year in defiance of Izetbegovic's war option. They urged 
for the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which broke out in April 
1992, to be solved through negotiations with Bosnian Serbs and 
Bosnian Croats with whom Abdic signed seperate peace accords. 
The fiercest fighting is reported by local Moslem media of the 
Cazin Krajina to be going on around Trsce and Trzacka Rastela, 
places taken three days ago by the Abdic forces. 
  The autonomous province agency ZBIA reports that Izetbegovic 
forces have launched an all-out attack but that they cannot 
penetrate the lines held by the Abdic forces and have therefore 
sent several sabotage and terrorist groups to try to get into 
Velika Kladusa, the political center of the province, and arrest 
Abdic. 
  The agency reports that one of the groups was eliminated in 
the vicinity of Todorovo, by Velika Kladusa.

  [Excerpts] The quiet morning on 18 January turned into 
hell for residents of the Celic region earlier this morning. 
Shortly after 1000, members of the Nordic battalion arrived in 
this area. Their arrival was immediately followed by shelling 
of the settlements of Vrazici and [word indistinct] from the 
direction of Brusnica. At the same time, infantry attacks were 
launched on the northeast part of our commune, from the 
direction of (?Siljes and Kupusanik), which was supported by 
anti-aircraft machine guns and anti-aircraft guns. The infantry 
attack was preceded by a strong artillery attack on the 
settlements of Celic and Ratkovici. More than 40 122-mm 
howitzer shells were fired from the direction of Markovac. In 
addition to material damage, they also wounded (?four) people in 
(?Celic). [passage omitted] 
  The last report we received refers to an attack on the 
members of the Nordic battalion. As we were told, the chetnik 
fired five [words indistinct] directly at the armored vehicles 
of the Nordic battalion [words indistinct]. We do not have many 
details of this attack, but it confirms best the hypocrisy of 
the chetnik leader Karadzic, who promised that such incidents 
would not happen.

<F P=106> [Interview with UN General Francis Briquemont by DER </F>
SPIEGEL; place and date not given: "Threats Are Useless"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. General, how is the situation in 
Sarajevo? 
  [Briquemont] The military situation is very tense throughout 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. While the diplomatic peace efforts 
continue, all warring parties want to prove in the combat zones 
that they are not in a weakened or inferior position. 
  I admire the people of Sarajevo: They are suffering, they 
are starving, they are ill, but they do not lose their dignity. 
Those who live here sometimes have the impression that the 
people who have to bear the war and the political leaders who 
caused it are worlds apart. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] At its Brussels summit, NATO again threatened 
air strikes if Sarajevo and the Muslim enclaves continue to be 
strangled. Do such announcements still terrify anybody? 
  [Briquemont] I am tired of having to listen again and again 
to the talk about air strikes. The siege of cities like 
Srebrenica, Gorazde, or Mostar cannot be broken by air strikes. 
Those who do not know the local conditions had better refrain 
from such demands. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Would the UN troops and their humanitarian 
help also be seriously endangered by NATO's military 
intervention? 
  [Briquemont] I am always surprised when I am expected to 
provide humanitarian help and promote the peace process inasmuch 
as possible, while at the same time politicians consider the 
threat of military force. One has to know what one wants. If 
one decides in favor of war, the UN troops will not be able to 
continue their humanitarian help under the circumstances. It is 
simply impossible to keep three warring parties in check and, in 
addition, help the civilian population with 8,000 blue helmets. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] That is to say, you would advise UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali against asking NATO for military 
help? 
  [Briquemont] How can you hope to achieve a peace agreement 
if you are threatening air strikes? After all, these strikes 
are only supposed to be aimed against one side: Everyone wants 
the Serbs to be given a thrashing. However, the problem is far 
more complicated. We are dealing with a conflict on three 
fronts; the idea taken from cowboy films, that is, that there 
always has to be a good guy and a bad guy, does not fit in with 
the inextricable Bosnian situation. The West cannot solve the 
problems with a series of threats. Those who advocate military 
force would have to accept the logic of war -- with all its 
consequences. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] So far, the threats have not been very 
credible. Would the hostile ethnic groups' preparedness for 
peace increase if NATO were really determined to intervene with 
massive force, if necessary? 
  [Briquemont] I am not sure whether this way of thinking is 
understood by Muslims, Croats, and Serbs. Because of their 
history, most of the people in former Yugoslavia are convinced 
that they can only solve their problems with force. The idea of 
solving conflicts by compromise, which is popular in the West, 
has not yet been generally accepted here. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Even the Muslims, who have always been 
regarded as victims so far, do not seem to be prepared to give 
in. 
  [Briquemont] The Muslims have changed a lot in the past few 
months; they have become more belligerent. I was taken aback 
when I heard a representative of Bosnian President Alija 
Izetbegovic say: We will win this war. The Bosnian Army, which 
was very weak when the fighting broke out, is meanwhile far 
better organized and equipped. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] That is to say, you are of the opinion that 
Muslims, Croats, and Serbs are equally to blame for the 
continuation of the slaughter? 
  [Briquemont] At present, we could quickly come to an 
agreement with the Serbs. They would only have to abandon some 
of their conquered territories. Serbian leader Karadzic has 
been basically prepared for it. At present, the worst fighting 
is taking place between Croats and Muslims in central Bosnia. I 
would have to have far more troops in order to be able to help 
and mediate there. For we would have to be present in every 
city and village; only in this way could the people's confidence 
in the UN mission be gained. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Is this confidence not irretrievably lost? 
The Western crisis managers failed as early as when the first 
symptoms of Yugoslavia's disintegration were shown. 
  [Briquemont] The greatest mistake was that the West was not 
able to agree on a joint strategy and a joint objective right 
from the beginning. There is a discrepancy between the 
declarations of intent and the means that are provided for us, 
the military, for the implementation of the political 
resolutions on the spot. One did not know exactly what one 
wanted, too many contradictory opinions were voiced. Successful 
crisis management is not possible as long as the course is not 
clear. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Would it have been better to intervene early 
with force, instead of helplessly watching the war spreading in 
the Balkans? 
  [Briquemont] If one had decided in favor of military 
intervention -- mind you, if -- all participating states would 
have had to be aware of what that means for them. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The West always flinched from these 
consequences. The hands of the dispatched blue helmets are 
tied. Thus far, about 70 UN soldiers have been killed by snipers. 
  [Briquemont] We are confronted with one of the dirtiest wars 
where anything goes. Our blue helmets are in an extremely 
difficult situation. But there is no intervention without risk. 
If we participate in such a humanitarian operation, we will 
have to expect casualties. Public opinion in the Western 
countries reacts very sensitively to every loss. However, those 
who send us here have to prepare themselves for tragedies. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] How could the safety of your soldiers from 22 
countries be improved? Do you need more troops? 
  [Briquemont] Reinforcements of at least 7,500 men would be 
necessary. Upon my request, the French and the Scandinavian 
countries, too, immediately sent a battalion. That means: 
Instead of 7,500, I got 2,000 additional soldiers. And then 
the European countries pretend to be generous and ask us to 
establish three additional land corridors in order to supply the 
population. We would need at least four battalions, 4,000 men, 
for this task alone. The United Nations is prepared to dispatch 
sufficient troops after a peace agreement. This is wonderful, 
but I would rather have these troops now, in order to be able to 
fulfill my mission more effectively. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Apparently, reinforcements will not come. Do 
you think that the time when the blue helmets will completely 
withdraw from Bosnia is near? 
  [Briquemont] If a peace agreement is not achieved by the end 
of January, the responsible politicians will have to completely 
reexamine our commitment in Bosnia. It is an illusion to 
believe that the UN troops could continue their humanitarian 
help indefinitely if the shooting goes on at the same time. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] For how long will you be able to hold out? 
  [Briquemont] Personally, I am of the opinion that in any 
case we will have to stay until the end of the winter. It would 
be irresponsible to let the civilian population down at this 
time of the year. However, if the war flares up with new 
violence in the spring, we will be confronted with the question 
of whether we can afford to continue as before. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You have already thrown in the towel as 
commander in chief of the UN troops in Bosnia, you asked for 
your replacement. Have you failed with your mission, which was 
actually supposed to last until the end of July? 
  [Briquemont] Nobody comes here to gain glory and success. 
He who hopes that is a fool. The only thing that we can 
achieve is to mitigate the people's misery and curb the war. I 
have done my best, this is only possible for a limited period. 
At some point everybody is going to be worn out. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you think that a one-year mission is too 
long? 
  [Briquemont] UN bureaucracy conceived the duration of the 
mission; it has nothing to do with the reality of Sarajevo. You 
cannot imagine what frustrations and humiliations are connected 
with this job. If one has gone through half a year, it is 
better to pass on the baton to somebody else who can burden 
himself with the same hardship with fresh energy.

  [Excerpt] Belgrade, 15 January (TANJUG) -- The main 
committee of the Serbian Renewal Movement [SPO] today expelled 
from the party 11 federal deputies because of "the most arrogant 
violation of the programme and statute." All of them, in 
keeping with the law and the legal acts of the Depos [Democratic 
Movement of Serbia] coalition, have had their mandates as 
deputies wthdrawn, the main committee of the SPO has announced. 
  Slobodan Rakitic, Strahinja Kastratovic, Radomir Urosevic, 
Pavle Premovic, Obren Joksimovic, Radenko Jokovic, Branislav 
Rakus, Vojislav Nedeljkovic, Zoran Cirkovic, Jovan Babic, and 
Jovan Tomic were expelled as members of the SPO. 
  Of the 122 members of the main committee who attended the 
session, 111 voted for the expulsions, five opposed, and six 
abstained. 
  In keeping with the law and legal acts of the Depos 
coalition, the main committee also elected 11 new SPO deputies 
to the Yugoslav Assembly. They will replace those who have been 
deputies hitherto and who had their mandates withdrawn by the 
party today. The new SPO federal deputies on the Depos 
coalition electoral list are: Dr. Gordana Anicic and Prof. 
Tomislav Jeremic (Belgrade electoral district), Dr. Danilo 
Beukovic and Engineer Pera Sijacki (Novi Sad electoral 
district), Dr. Dragoslav Isakovic and Dr. Dusan Vasic (Uzice 
electoral district), lawyer Nikola Koca Djordjevic and Prof. 
Milos Filipovic (Kragujevac electoral district), graduate 
engineer Dragoljub Janes (Nis electoral district), and lawyer 
Sreten Nesih (Leskovac electoral district). [only 10 names as 
received] 
  The main committee rejected all the allegations contained in 
the letter of the 11 former federal deputies as untrue and 
designed only to undermine the electoral success of the SPO and 
Depos. The main committee assessed "the sad fact that the 
signatories sent their pamphlet-style letter, which was untrue 
and not based on the facts, to state television and not to the 
party authorities" as the most arrogant violation of the SPO 
program and statute. 
  Everything was carried out in accordance with a scenario 
prepared in conjunction with the special political command of 
the ruling regime, which is tasked with smashing and shaming the 
democratic opposition, and especially the SPO and Depos as the 
most powerful opposition forces, the statement says. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> ["Clinton: Sending of Troops to Bosnia Would be Sheer Folly" </F>
-- TANJUG headline] 
  [Text] Moscow, January 15 (TANJUG) -- United States (U.S.) 
President Bill Clinton has said that his country was not sending 
troops to the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
nor did it want to seize territories, because that would be 
sheer folly. 
  A civil war of its three constitutive peoples -- Moslems, 
Serbs and Croats -- has been raging in Bosnia-Herzegovina since 
April 1992. 
  Clinton on Friday evening [14 January] told Russian 
television that the U.S. supported Bosnian Moslems because it 
supports the multi-national government of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
which is recognized by the United Nations. Clinton, however, 
immediately added that his country knew that the Bosnian 
Government included mostly Moslem elements. The U.S. supports 
the U.N. mission and wants the bloodshed of people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to end, the U.S. President said. 
  There are no more legally elected representatives of Bosnian 
Serbs or Bosnian Croats in the authorities of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. They walked out of all legal organs because 
Bosnian Moslems, violating the constitutionally established 
equality of the three peoples, want to enforce their domination. 
  The Serbs were the first to leave the Bosnian leadership 
because the Moslem-Croat authorities asked for the recognition 
of the independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina without their 
approval, although the Constitution specifically said that major 
decisions can be adopted only on the grounds of consensus among 
the three peoples. Disagreeing with the insistence of Bosnian 
Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic on a unitary Bosnia-Herzegovina 
in which his fellow Moslems and Islam would dominate, Bosnian 
Serbs and Bosnian Croats have proclaimed their own state 
communities -- the Serb republic and the Croatian republic of 
Herzeg-Bosna, respectively.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, Jan 14 (TANJUG) - Yugoslav Deputy Prime 
Minister Zeljko Simic on Friday [14 January] pointed at the 
decisive role played by, as he said, `the hasty and rashly' 
policy of the European Union in the eruption of the conflict in 
the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  During talks with a Spanish parliamentary delegation, Simic 
underscored there would have been no war in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
if the right to self-determination of peoples was `applied 
universally and not selectivelly.' He said it was the 
legitimate right of the Serbian people to fight for its rigth to 
self-determination. The Spanish delegation was recieved by the 
Chairman of the Yugoslav Parliament's Board for Foreign and 
Economic Relations, Borisav Jovic, who assessed that the war of 
the territory of the former Yugoslavia could end soon if Europe 
and the United States exerted uniform pressure on the three 
warring sides -- Moslems, Serbs and Croats -- in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Jovic called for the soonest possible lifting of the 
international sanctions imposed against the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia and assessed that without any valid historical 
explaination Yugoslavia was being converted into `a 
concentration camp in which people are starting to die of 
hunger' at the threshold of the twenty first century. He 
recalled that Yugoslavia had maximumly contributed to the 
peaceful solution to the conflict on the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia and that at the same time it was subject to sanctions 
which have destroyed it economically, although it is not at war 
nor has it provoked the war in any way. 
  Jovic said the basic aims of Yugoslavia's foreign policy 
were 
the restoration of peace on the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia, the lifting of the sanctions and the reintegration 
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia into the international 
community. 
  The Spanish delegation, headed by Ernest Luch, assessed that 
the international community hastly recognized the separatist 
Yugoslav republics. The speaker of the Yugoslav parliament's 
chamber of republics, Milos Radulovic, underscored during his 
meeting with the Spanish delegation that the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia has since the very beginning been urging through its 
parliament the search for a solution in Bosnia by peaceful means 
and on an equal basis for all the three sides in conflict.

  [Text] Belgrade, January 16 (TANJUG) -- Serbian 
Vice-Premier Danilo Markovic said on Saturday during talks with 
a Spanish parliament delegation that local self-administration 
and cultural autonomy for the Albanian national minority can be 
introduced in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo-Metohija 
(Kosmet), but certainly not state autonomy because that would 
endanger the territorial integrity of the republic. 
  The Spanish political-parliamentary delegation, headed by 
Ernest Luch, was informed in detail by Markovic about the 
genesis and strategy of Albanian separatism in Kosmet and 
efforts by Serbia to normalize the situation in this province. 
A strong separatist movement has been active for decades in 
Kosmet, where ethnic Albanians are the majority population. 
Ethnic Albanian political leaders urge the secession of this 
province from Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and 
its annexing to neighbouring Albania. 
  The Spanish MP's, who have been touring former Yugoslavia 
for 
several days in order to collect information about developments 
and possibilities for a peaceful and just resolving of the 
crisis in this region, had talks in Belgrade on Saturday with a 
delegation of the republic of Serb Krajina, which was headed by 
Vice-Premier Stojan Spanovic. The Spanish delegation was 
informed about the history of the republic of Serb Krajina on 
the basis of data from works published by foreign historians and 
cartographers and figures of the Roman Catholic Church, which 
testify to the centuries-long compactness of the ethnic presence 
of the Serb people in the current territory of Krajina. The 
Spanish representatives said that these figures were generally 
ignored abroad. 
  The Krajina delegation pointed out that the international 
community should accept the right of the Serb people to 
self-determination in agreement with the United Nations Charter, 
because Serbs in Krajina will never again agree to be governed 
by Croatia. 
  The republic of Serb Krajina was formed in 1991 in 
Serb-populated parts of Croatia in answer to Croatia's forcible 
secession from former Yugoslavia and attempts to reduce the Serb 
people to a national minority. The republic of Serb Krajina has 
been a U.N. Protected Area since March of 1992.

  [Text] Skopje, 17 Jan (TANJUG) -- The Macedonian press 
today quotes a statement by the U.S. Army Chief of Staff General 
Gordon Sullivan that the American Army is ready to prevent any 
aggression against (the former Yugoslav Republic of) Macedonia 
and to provide humanitarian aid for Macedonia. 
  Gen. Gordon yesterday spent several hours in Macedonia and 
visited American soldiers with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] 
and two blue helmet observer positions. Before his departure 
from Skopje he said that he was very satisfied with UNPROFOR's 
mission on preserving stability in "this important region." The 
U.S. Army Chief of Staff ruled out the possibility of increasing 
the contingent of U.S. soldiers with UNPROFOR stationed in 
Macedonia. Asked what his opinion was about a possible NATO 
military intervention in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, he 
briefly said that he was a soldier, not a diplomat. Gen. 
Sullivan also had a meeting in Skopje with the chief of general 
staff of the Macedonian army, Colonel-General Dragoljub Bocinov.

Protection Forces] Detained in Serbia"] 
  [Text] It has been announced on 14 January in Belgrade 
that two transporters carrying members of the U.S. and Norwegian 
units of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] in Macedonia crossed 
into Serbian territory on 13 January, near the army barracks 
Slavovec, whereby the soldiers, who did not carry any weapons, 
and did not give any resistance, were apprehended by the Serbian 
border guards. After ten hours of interrogation, they were 
returned to Macedonia at the border crossing Tabanovce. 
According to an anonymous UNPROFOR officer in Macedonia, the 
three Americans and two Norwegians were treated well by the 
Serbian border guards. "It is possible that they could have 
crossed into Serbian territory while they were trying tot save 
one of the vehicles," the officer said. Otherwise, a number of 
such incidents have occurred at this frontier, as it has not 
been strictly defined.

  [Text] Skopje, 14 January (TANJUG) -- A delegation of the 
American Congress led by John Murphy, which is paying a visit to 
Skopje, has been received by Kiro Gligorov, president of the 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. On that occasion, views 
were exchanged on the current situation in the Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia and the region and also on the development 
of friendly relations between the two countries. 
  The American congressmen expressed particular pleasure over 
the successful cooperation with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] 
and the Macedonian Government. The American side reiterated its 
interest in the preservation of peace and stability in the 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. In the course of the 
talks yesterday, President Gligorov informed his American guests 
about a Macedonian request to join NATO, particularly to join 
the Partnership for Peace initiative. This would be, Gligorov 
said, an important step forward in the prevention of the spread 
of war to the south of the Balkans and in securing a higher 
level of stability and security in the region. 
  In his statement for the local state television, Congressman 
Murphy [title as received] expressed readiness to deploy fresh 
additional U.S. Army forces in the UN peace mission, but 
according to UNPROFOR, there is no reason for such a move.

  [Text] Pristina, 14 Jan (TANJUG) -- Ibrahim Rugova, 
president of the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo (DSK), today 
welcomed the NATO decision on partnership with eastern European 
countries made at the summit in Brussels. At a news conference, 
he did not comment on the NATO threat to bomb the Bosnian Serb 
positions, but only said that "the threat is realistic." The 
DSK leader described as positive British Prime Minister John 
Major's statement on "the policy of prevention in Kosovo." 
Rugova said that the incidents on the Yugoslav-Albanian border 
are "a provocation against Albania, but also against the ethnic 
Albanians in Kosovo." Rugova did not elaborate further on any 
of these issues, nor on his habitual claim about "the repression 
against the Albanians in Kosovo."

  [Text] In an interview given to Prishtina's weekly ZERI, 
commenting on his latest tour of several European countries, 
Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic of Kosova, states that 
he encountered understanding for the right to independence and 
neutrality of the people of Kosova in all of his meetings. The 
proposal to place Kosova under international protection is 
simply a political means toward Kosova's independence. The UN 
should decide on this with the mediation of the European Union 
and the United States, said Mr. Rugova, among other things, to 
Prishtina's ZERI.

<F P=106> [Report by M. Antic: "`Trepca' on Temporary Leave"] </F>
  [Text] Pristina -- Milenko Ilic, general manager of 
Trepca, has extended the 10-day New Year and Christmas holiday 
for all employees of the Trepca corporation until 24 January, 
and proclaimed that this temporary leave is "the first part of 
the annual holidays." 
  So, instead of the promise given in the electoral campaign 
that "Trepca would get back on its feet," the agony of the 
largest and wealthiest company in Serbia continues. Yesterday, 
the workers, instead of returning to the mines, smeltery, 
refineries, and factories, had to return home, because the 
general manager had informed them that there were no raw 
materials, spare parts, protective agents, or reagents necessary 
for production. Until further notice, that is, according to the 
manager's current assessment at least until 24 January, the 
following Trepca mines will be closed: the mine in Stari Trg, 
"Kisnica," "Novo Brdo," and "Kopaonik" in Leposavic. The lead 
and zinc metallurgy plants, the entire chemical industry, and 
the Center for Research and Development will also be closed. 
  The only employees still working are the clerks who draw up 
inventories of property, calculate salaries, and sign annual 
holiday requests. Also working are the work organizers 
[organizatori posla]. 
  Ilic, the general manager, did not elaborate on his 
decision, 
although everyone expected that Trepca would be the very one to 
"get back on its feet" not only in Kosmet [Kosovo and Metohija] 
but in the entire Serbian economy. Such promises were also 
given by the Serbian Government, which spent a lot of time 
thinking about Trepca. However, judging by everything, the aid 
did not come because, according to Ilic, Trepca has no chance of 
resuming production.

  [Excerpts] According to Andras Agoston, chairman of the 
Democratic Community of Hungarians in Vojvodina [VMDK], a new 
wave of migration may begin, because the Hungarians in Vojvodina 
feel that their suffering will not end in the near future. 
Judit Laszlo reports. 
  [Laszlo] [passage omitted] Andras Agoston called it a rumor 
that the VMDK will be the socialists' coalition partner. The 
Hungarians of Vojvodina wish to ask the English, French, and 
Russian leaders of the peace process for advice on the formation 
of an internationally legitimate government, without the 
intervention of foreign countries in rump Yugoslavia's domestic 
issues. 
  According to Deputy Chairman Janos Vekas, Hungary's help is 
also needed in settling the issue. Therefore, the VMDK has 
launched an initiative for the parties of the Hungarian 
parliament and the political forces of the Hungarians beyond the 
borders to issue a joint declaration to the effect that they 
wish to realize their national policy interests jointly. In 
this declaration, the VMDK demands every form of political 
autonomy, said Deputy Chairman Janos Vekas.

  [Excerpt] [Gajdosevic] Milan Martic, candidate for 
president of the republic of Serbian Krajina, visited Baranja 
today. He was warmly welcomed in Darda, Beli Manastir, and 
Knezevi Vinogradi. His statement that he would do his best to 
keep his mandate as short as possible, and that he would hand 
over his presidential function to Slobodan Milosevic, were 
greeted here with long applause. 
  [Begin Martic recording] I have never concealed the fact 
that I am committed to this course, that is, that I am carrying 
out the program drafted by our pan-Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic. Despite attacks by some malicious people saying that 
I am a puppet of that great president of ours, I can openly say 
that I am nobody's puppet, but I am very well acquainted with 
the program of President Milosevic and his associates, and the 
program of Dr. Radovan Karadzic and his associates, which are 
absolutely identical. [end recording] 
  [Gajdosevic] By stressing that Serbia was behind him, FRY 
[Sports] Minister Zoran Bingulac supported the candidacy of 
Milan Martic, as did Radovan Pankov [chairman of the Socialist 
Party of Serbia for Vojvodina], and Brana Crncevic and Ljuba 
Novakovic [Socialist Party of Serbia deputies in the Serbian 
Assembly]. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Zoltan Kabok] </F>
  [Text] Representatives of the government of the Republic of 
Croatia, led by Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic, today 
met members of the Club of Deputies of the Serbian National 
Party [Srpska Narodna Stranka, SNS]. 
  The political issue of settling the Serbian problem in 
Croatia was the main topic of the discussion, at which the 
assembly SNS deputies presented their remarks and expressed 
pleasure at the end of the meeting, saying that only through 
such meetings a solution can be found in joint work. The 
implementation of the constitutional law on human rights and 
liberties, rights of ethnic communities and national minorities, 
the issue of education, election of Serbian minority 
representatives to the Chamber of Counties of the Croatian 
Assembly, appointment of Serbian minority representatives to 
some positions in county councils, protected areas, the future 
of local authorities -- these are but a few questions that the 
assembly deputies of Serbian nationality consider decisive for 
the return of trust in the institutions of the system. After 
representatives of relevant ministries had spoken, Croatian 
Prime Minister Nikica Valentic said this about the mentioned 
problems: 
  [Begin Valentic recording] Without any political demagogy I 
can completely openly say here that Croatia must build two 
criteria: First, it has to build a democratic state; it is 
well-known that in such a state all citizens must enjoy equal 
rights, because a state that does not guarantee that cannot be a 
state in the European sense of the word. Consequently, Croatia 
must be a democratic state and that is the fundamental intention 
of our government, and second, Croatia must be an economically 
strong state. [end recording] 
  [Kabok] Expressing obvious pleasure at the end of the 
meeting, the SNS assembly deputies once again stressed that all 
Serbian problems must be resolved exclusively within the 
Republic of Croatia.

  [Text] The Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] presidency 
held its fourth session in Zagreb last night with President 
Franjo Tudjman in the chair. Here is a report: 
  After an exhaustive discussion on the current political 
situation in Croatia and Croatia's policy concerning efforts to 
establish a just peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, all members of the 
presidency voiced their support for Croatian President Franjo 
Tudjman's present policy, in the spirit of the stands adopted at 
the second HDZ congress. 
  For this reason, all misinformation about divisions within 
the HDZ leadership and about an alleged rift in the HDZ is 
malicious and false. Equally false is the speculation, carried 
by some media, that some high-ranking state officials, 
especially Messrs [Stipe] Mesic, [Josip] Manolic, and [Gojko] 
Susak have been replaced. The changes already made were carried 
out in line with HDZ policy. 
  In addition, the spreading of misinformation about major 
changes in the interior and defense ministries, and claims that 
[Defense] Minister Susak is to be replaced by Franjo Greguric 
are especially harmful. 
  The presidency heard a report about allegations that the 
president of the republic has called for the resignation of 
Assembly Chairman Stipe Mesic. The truth is that Stipe Mesic is 
on annual leave and will be spending some time abroad. 
  The presidency made political assessments of some examples 
of 
opposition to the implementation of state policy, such as the 
unnecessary clash of views concerning foreign investments in 
Valpovo, which harmed Croatia's foreign relations, despite the 
repeated stand of the Croatian leadership encouraging foreign 
investments. 
  A tribute was paid to Osijek municipality, the county's HDZ 
branch, the county leadership, and county prefect Branimir 
Glavas for their positive initiatives directed toward 
normalizing relations with the Serbian ethnic community and 
gradually introducing Croatian authorities in UN Protected Areas 
[UNPA]. 
  By contrast, a statement issued by the Karlovac HDZ city 
committee on 12 January this year was assessed as harmful and 
unacceptable. The statement called on the remaining Croats to 
move out of UNPA's. However, the HDZ presidency maintains that 
it is the duty of all state and other institutions to help all 
Croats in every possible way to preserve their homes and stay 
there, while making efforts to normalize relations with Serbs in 
Croatian territory under UN protection as soon as possible. 
This policy has never been demagogical, but reflects the 
sincerity of the Croatian leadership in its consistent efforts 
to establish Croatia's full sovereignty in all territories of 
the Republic of Croatia. 
  The presidency assessed that some opposition parties' moves 
and demands geared toward creating a constitutional crisis and 
early elections are clearly failing to contribute to the 
consolidation of Croatia's internal stability and international 
position. On the contrary, they are aimed at destabilizing the 
democratic system. Their purpose is to cause dissatisfaction and 
unrest among the people, encourage strikes, and, as they 
themselves admit, cooperate with a moderate faction within the 
HDZ in order to bring about a constitutional crisis and topple 
the authorities. All this should be viewed within the framework 
of opposition and foreign speculation about a need to look for 
acceptable successors in the Republic of Croatia and in other 
states created after the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia. 
  The HDZ presidency is consistent in its efforts to establish 
a law-governed state, protect human rights and press freedom. 
At the same time, it warns that some of the media are clearly 
working to destabilize the government using various methods, 
even inhumane and uncivilized ones. For instance, some media 
are publishing articles and manipulating the results of opinion 
polls in order to create a false picture of the public mood and 
a favorable climate for the destruction of the 
democratically-elected government. 
  The presidency voiced its support for implementation of the 
government's stabilization program, which has been and remains 
the program of the HDZ. It will resolutely overcome resistance 
to the implementation of government decisions; this phenomenon 
is found at all levels of the old bureaucracy. The presidency 
urged a serious and consistent implementation and further 
elaboration of this program, as final success and the 
realization of Croatia's economic renaissance, as outlined in 
the president's address to the assembly last year, depend on 
this. 
  All members of the presidency once again expressed their 
joint resolve to persevere in implementing HDZ policy under the 
leadership of President Franjo Tudjman. It is this that led to 
the establishment of the Croatian state and its international 
recognition. It will result in the full liberation of all 
Croatian territories, help bring about a just peace in 
neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina, and secure the strategic 
interests of the Croatian state.

  [Text] During its regular weekly meeting held today, 
Romania's Government adopted the following statement on NATO's 
Partnership for Peace proposal. 
  The statement made by Romania's President on 11 January 1994 
-- a statement that was released immediately after the 
conclusion of the Brussels summit of the North Atlantic Council 
-- represents the official acceptance by our country of the 
Partnership for Peace, as a new form of cooperation between NATO 
and the democratic countries situated to the east of Alliance, 
designed to lead to consolidating security and stability in 
Europe. 
  Romania's Government notes with full satisfaction and 
accepts 
the invitation addressed by the North Atlantic Council to the 
interested states, including our country, to participate in the 
Partnership for Peace, considering it as a preliminary stage for 
Romania's eventual admission to NATO as a fully fledged member. 
Romania's Government declares that it is ready to sign the 
basic document on the participation to a new form of partnership 
as soon as possible, and asks the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to 
take urgent steps in this direction. At the same time, the 
government has asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the 
Ministry of National Defense to work out a draft document on 
Romania's participation, which will identify the measures that 
our country intends to adopt in order to implement the political 
goals of the Partnership for Peace and will specify the military 
and other means that our country might use for activities within 
the Partnership for Peace framework, after consultations with 
the specialized commissions of the two chambers of Romania's 
Parliament. 
  The government will submit the draft document to the 
approval 
of the Supreme Council for the Country's Defense. On the basis 
of this document and of a partnership program to be worked out 
by NATO, the sides will proceed to negotiating and signing the 
individual Partnership for Peace program between Romania and 
NATO, which will be submitted for ratification to the country's 
Parliament, in accordance with constitutional provisions. 
Likewise, proceeding from the provisions of the invitation to 
participate in the Partnership for Peace, the government asked 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of National 
Defense to appoint their civilian and military representatives 
to the Alliance's headquarters in Brussels and to the 
coordinating cell of the Partnership for Peace at SHAPE [Supreme 
Headquarters of Allied Powers Europe] in Mons, Belgium. 
  Romania's Government believes that the provisions of the 
basic document on consultations with NATO in the event of a 
direct threat to the partner states as well as the provisions of 
the Declaration of Principles adopted by the North Atlantic 
Council in Brussels on 11 January 1994 unequivocally take into 
consideration Romania's vital security interests. At the same 
time, the government considers our country's participation in 
the Partnership for Peace an essential component of the global 
process of Romania's integration into the Euro-Atlantic 
structures, a key goal of Romanian foreign policy. The 
government particularly values the national consensus that has 
emerged among the parliamentary political forces on the issue of 
accepting the invitation for Romania's participation in the 
Partnership for Peace -- the Romanian Government's statement 
reads in conclusion.

  [Excerpts] Madeleine Albright, special envoy of U.S. 
President Bill Clinton and America's ambassador to the United 
Nations, paid a visit to Bucharest today. Her visit included 
talks at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a meeting with 
Romania's President Ion Iliescu at Cotroceni Palace, a working 
lunch, and a news conference held upon departure at Otopeni 
Airport. [passage omitted] 
  In a statement made to journalists after the talks at 
Cotroceni, President Ion Iliescu said that he views most 
favorably the presence in Bucharest of the American ambassador 
to the United Nations, the message delivered on behalf of 
President Bill Clinton, and the information received in 
connection with the Brussels decisions and the Partnership for 
Peace. 
  Ion Iliescu said that even before the Brussels meeting, 
Romania believed that this is perhaps one of the wisest 
decisions aimed at eliminating any discrimination in relations 
with the countries in this part of Europe and at ensuring a 
favorable framework of equal security for all European states 
and preparations for an evolutionary process for integration in 
NATO. We, said President Ion Iliescu, have expressed our choice 
and hope for future integration in NATO structures, and we see 
the Partnership for Peace as the most favorable framework for a 
normal evolution of this process. We have discussed real 
political and military preparation for these measures, which 
will be examined by the Supreme Council for the country's 
defense to develop contacts and finalize the framework for 
integration in the Partnership for Peace process. 
  In his statement Mr. Iliescu noted that other issues 
connected with peace and security in Europe as well as aspects 
of bilateral relations were also broached. On economic 
relations, we, the president mentioned, emphasized the need to 
develop a new economic partnership plan, as a new philosophy and 
political concept of economic relations both on the European 
continent, between equal partners, as well as a concept designed 
to govern international economic relations. 
  This is required because the world economy faces a systemic 
crisis and discrepancies between the rich and poor worlds risk 
turning into the most dangerous and explosive source for 
destabilization and insecurity in the world. This is also an 
imperative issue at the European level, in the context of 
difficulties presented by the transition to a market economy in 
the countries neighboring Romania. 
  Ion Iliescu expressed his view that the issue of developing 
a 
concept of economic partnership and cooperation is part of a 
common fate and common opportunity. He stated that during the 
talks with the American ambassador to the United Nations he 
discovered that they shared almost identical views on security 
and economic cooperation issues. The Romanian president added 
that during the talks the sides emphasized prospects for 
developing the Romanian-American dialogue at the highest level 
and he reiterated the invitation extended to President Bill 
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore to visit Romania.

  [Text] Today three-hour talks were held by representatives 
of the Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] and those of the 
Democratic Party-National Salvation Front [PD-FSN]. The goal of 
the talks, to which the press did not have access, was to find 
consensus elements in the views of the opposition parties that 
are prepared to assume responsibility for leading the country 
out of its current situation. 
  A statement released for the press after the conclusion of 
the talks says that in the opinion shared by the opposition 
parties, they are able to come up with concrete suggestions 
regarding both political and economic-social problems. Today's 
talks prove that the opposition parties have the necessary 
foresight, will, and competence to ensure the economic recovery, 
social peace, political stability, and international credibility 
of the country, the statement says. 
  Assessing that the current deadlock is the consequence of a 
government based on political alliances that are harmful for the 
country, as they allow for the access to power of certain 
non-democratic, anti-reform, extremist, and xenophobic forces, 
the current parliamentary opposition declares that it is ready 
to assume the responsibility for ruling the country. To that 
purpose the parliamentary majority has to be restructured and 
therefore the opposition expresses its readiness to set up a 
coalition government with the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of 
Romania -- ruling party]. 
  The responsibility now lies with those who hold the 
principal 
levers of the current political power. If the political 
proposal made by the opposition is ignored, the solution to this 
problem should be given by means of the direct vote of the 
nation [early elections], the statement concludes.

  [Excerpt] Yesterday evening, on a program for television, 
Adrian Nastase, executive chairman of Social Democracy Party of 
Romania [PDSR], made a number of remarks about the current 
political negotiations [between President Ion Iliescu and 
leaders of parties that are represented in parliament] and a 
possible government reshuffle. 
  The offer made by the Democratic Convention of Romania 
[CDR], 
which wishes to strike an alliance with the Democratic 
Party-National Salvation Front [PD-FSN] and PDSR in view of 
setting up a government, was assessed by Nastase as valuable in 
principle, but problem-generating at the practical level, which 
also refers to the idea of modifying the existing balance [of 
forces in parliament], namely 47 percent belonging to the 
opposition [CDR together with CD-FSN], as compared with 34 
percent belonging to the PDSR, as such a thing would turn the 
current ruling party into a minority one. 
  Furthermore, Nastase noted that the aforementioned offer 
also 
tries to make PDSR sever all relations with the parties that 
have been its allies until now, and thus the offer might also 
influence the electorate of the ruling party. 
  Under such circumstances, in Nastase's opinion, for the time 
being no such coalition cabinet can be set up, and, considering 
that there can be no interruptions in the government of the 
country, as well as the offer of PUNR to participate in the act 
of governing, they [PDSR] have engaged in negotiations with that 
party. Those negotiations are to be concluded within a few 
days, and they will offer a realistic short-term alternative. 
Meanwhile, talks will be continued with the CDR as well. 
  In the PDSR's opinion, the principal goal is to achieve a 
political pact that should refer to a minimum number of 
essential issues for the country, regardless of the political 
color of the government, such as economic issues, association 
with European and Euro-Atlantic bodies, the memorandum to be 
signed with the International Monetary Fund, the privatization 
and economic restructuring processes, as well as a number of 
social aspects, including the dialogue with the trade unions.

<F P=106> [Article by Silviu Achim: "Romanians Compensated by the </F>
Hungarian State"] 
  [Text] On Saturday [8 January], while the mayors and 
counselors of ethnic Hungarians living in the southern part of 
Slovakia were debating the issue of their self-government in 
Komarno, the leaders of the UDMR [Democratic Union of Hungarians 
in Romania] county branches held an important meeting in the 
town of Miercurea Ciuc. All those who thought that this was 
more than just coincidence were wrong, because despite the fact 
that UDMR did send a message encouraging the Komarno conference, 
UDMR still considers, according to its executive chairman, Csaba 
Takacs, that it has to follow its own way, that the steps taken 
by the Hungarian minorities living in other regions are not 
identical to those taken here, and that neither the success nor 
the failure of the Komarno conference can influence in any way 
the policy adopted by UDMR. Right now UDMR believes that the 
most pressing issue to be dealt with is the Hungarian minority 
[of Romania] economic situation. As a matter of fact, one of 
the angles of that issue was also debated during the Miercurea 
Ciuc meeting. 
  According to Bela Zsolt Gyorgy, deputy chairman of UDMR, 
that 
angle refers to the implementation of Bill No.32 of 1991 passed 
by the parliament in Budapest, that also concerning -- as 
strange as some might find this -- a number of 36,000 Romanian 
citizens. The aforementioned bill stipulates that the Hungarian 
state should pay damages (in the form of compensation notes) to 
its former citizens, who during World War II were captured by 
the Soviets. The maximum amount to be paid is 11,000 forints 
(about $120) for each month spent by each person after 1 August 
1945 in Soviet prisoner camps. The lawmakers decided to 
distinguish among persons who are currently Hungarian citizens 
and those who today are citizens of other states. The latter may 
sell their compensation notes on the free market or on the stock 
exchange market; they may buy goods in certain shops; they may 
invest them or turn them into stocks of various companies. 
However, all this may be done solely in Hungary. 
  The Miercurea Ciuc meeting was intended to inform the 
participants in detail about the stipulations of the 
aforementioned bill and to minimize the risks that could occur 
while using the said compensation notes. Considering that about 
20 percent of the persons eligible to receive such damages are 
ethnic Romanians (about 8-10,000 persons), UDMR intends to 
translate into Romanian the booklet that it will publish 
containing information on the bill. Deputy chairman Gyorgy also 
told us that the deadline for registering as a former prisoner 
of war has already expired, but between 15 February and 15 March 
of this year people can still hand in the necessary 
documentation to be included among those who are eligible to 
receive compensation. 
  In Transylvania certain people are still speculating about 
the possible political, propaganda, or other kind of purposes of 
that bill. And it is quite likely that some of their suspicions 
might turn out to be true. However, until then there is nothing 
we can do except highlight (and he who has ears will hear) 
UDMR's sustained efforts to continuously keep its entire 
electorate.

<F P=106> [Report by Bogdan Eduard: "Gheorghe Funar Will Change the </F>
Inscription on the Statue of the King of Hungary"] 
  [Text] Gheorghe Funar, mayor of the city of Cluj, chairman 
of PUNR [National Romanian Unity Party], has prepared a series 
of actions for this year intended to "please" the Hungarian 
ethnic minority. Thus, the mayor has decided to finalize work 
on the equestrian statue of King Matthias Corvinus in the center 
of the city by replacing the [Latin] inscription [on the 
pedestal] Mathias Rex with a new [Romanian] one, Matei Corvinul. 
  According to reliable sources, Funar regards the old 
inscription as a compromise solution arrived at by the 
communists and Horthysts [Hungarian fascists during World War 
II], and, therefore, it has to be eliminated right away so that 
it will not overshadow the great festivities to celebrate the 
anniversary of the 1859 Union [of Wallachia with Moldavia] that 
are to take place in Cluj on 24 January. 
  It should be noted that, on 6 December 1992, the measure 
[taken by Funar] to modify the equestrian statue of King 
Matthias [by adding a plaque belittling the personality of the 
king and hoisting the national colors all around the statute] 
triggered off unprecedented protests on behalf of the ethnic 
Hungarians living in the city.

  [Text] Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak said that every 
country that accepts the American Partnership for Peace program 
would individually decide the scope of its cooperation with 
NATO. He added that the forms and scope of Poland's cooperation 
with NATO were also linked with the capacity of this year's 
budget. 
  In an interview for the Polish Radio Third Program, the 
prime 
minister said that details of Poland's cooperation with NATO, as 
part of the Partnership for Peace program, as well as the 
results of the recent visit by President Walesa and the prime 
minister to Prague, will be discussed at today's meeting of the 
government. 
  Waldemar Pawlak announced that this year, as an 
anti-inflation measure, the government would attempt to slow 
down the pace of official price rises [ceny urzedowe]. 
  The prime minister emphasized that the numerous changes, 
which have recently occurred in Poland, have been achieved in a 
democratic way, without the upheavals and conflicts which took 
place in other countries. 
  Waldemar Pawlak expressed the opinion that in the spring 
local government elections, it would be better to use the old 
electoral system instead of the new one proposed by the Social 
Democracy of the Polish Republic. According to the prime 
minister, councillors and representatives of the local 
government assemblies [sejmiki samorzadowe], with whom he 
recently had talks, were in favor of such a solution.

<F P=106> ["Excerpt" from introductory speech by Radovan Karadzic, </F>
president of the republic of Srpska, at the Serbian assembly 
session in Bijeljina on 17 January -- recorded] 
  [Text] We are making concessions for peace, the 
concessions are being accepted, peace is not being secured, new 
concessions are demanded, and this is then repeated, with us 
extending and advancing this platform at our expense, and every 
time the platform is (?newer) and has more Serbian concessions 
and yet there is no peace. 
  Esteemed deputies, you must decide whether we should stop 
making concessions. You, as well as the general population, the 
people that you represent, must decide when we should put a stop 
to all this. You must decide how many people have to die for a 
Serbian village for us then to give that Serbian village to the 
Muslims. It is much easier for us to give a Serbian village 
away without anyone getting killed. This means that had we 
accepted at the (?Lisbon) conference [words indistinct] without 
casualties, it would have been easier for us to move our people 
from some of their homes, because we would have created a state. 
These generations would have suffered, this segment of the 
population would have suffered, but from the national point of 
view, the job would have been finished. 
  The longer the war lasts, the more our young men get killed 
in defense of their hearths, and the fewer concessions we can 
make. We must state this openly. Our people believe us, but 
are shaking their heads wondering why we have been making so 
many concessions. We always said that we made concessions 
because of peace. We do not have a surplus of Serbs, we want to 
save every Serb. However, the other side is preparing for a 
long and bloody war. The other side is rejecting all peace 
initiatives. The other side is violating cease-fires. The 
other side is arming itself. The other side is trying to 
deceive us in the negotiations, so that we demobilize both 
psychologically and in our frame of mind, to adjust ourselves to 
the peace that is about to happen, whereas they are preparing 
for even fiercer offensives, probably next Spring. 
  It seems to me that this round of talks in Geneva is the 
turning point and that nothing will be the same again after it. 
We cannot allow ourselves to prepare for a peace that will not 
happen. If there is no peace, if it becomes clear at this round 
of talks that there will be no peace, we will have to prepare 
for war. Gentlemen, as you know, we have been waging a war 
according to peacetime laws. We have not proclaimed a state of 
war. We proclaimed a state of immediate danger of war even 
though a war was declared on us. This is one of the great 
achievements of this assembly, of the people in general, and of 
the republic of Srpska, the fact that we created the state on 
our own, according to peacetime laws. 
  If this state comes under threat, above all by our immediate 
enemies and then their allies and helpers from all over the 
world, as well as the strongest military force in the world, 
NATO, and the countries that support it, then we must prepare 
for war. Our state is two years old, or rather two years young; 
it is mature and strong enough to defend itself. On the other 
hand, the preparations for defense will (?dissuade) possible 
aggressors from their intentions. 
  Therefore, I think that today, in open discussions, we 
should 
come up with as many ideas as possible on what to do next. I 
personally think that the existing platform should be offered 
until it is rejected there, although we believe the Muslims have 
already rejected it, because the official representative of 
their delegation told our official representative that this was 
out of the question. This is quite clear and we should prepare 
back-up alternatives. 
  These back-up alternatives should come from today's 
discussion, from your views. We know how many times we [words 
indistinct] convincing you, begging you, explaining to you to 
accept compromises. We have no regrets. We think that it was 
our duty to ensure peace to our people, above all, even if at 
the cost of some territories. However, it has now [word 
indistinct] that we no longer have the choice nor the right to 
deceive ourselves, because we are facing an enemy that does not 
want anything, an enemy that is supported by almost the entire 
world, an enemy that expects us not to do anything militarily, 
and to adhere to a platform that is very conciliatory. 
  I am still of the opinion that if peace were established, if 
killings stopped, it would still pay to make the sacrifices 
contained in the current platform. With (?this) we would save 
many of our lives and many houses. However, if this peace is 
not to come to pass, we must come to a new position, even if 
this position remains [word indistinct]; we must have back-up 
alternatives, even if they remained unpublished, but we must 
arrive at a platform on the basis of which you representatives 
would act in the interest of ending the war and the realization 
of our aims. 
  All our aims are still valid, except the creation of the 
republic of Srpska. They are still valid because we are 
involved in a peace process that has had no success. With their 
definitive historical aims, the Serbian people have embarked on 
the path. They are entitled to them. They have no obstacles in 
the way, noone who has a right to obstruct them. They will try 
to obstruct us (?illegitimately), but all these things are still 
valid: the unification with Krajina, the unification with 
Serbia, the defining of borders, the outlet to the sea, and the 
creation of an economic and political system. We are simply 
running late because the other side, which is continually losing 
battles to us, does not want to sign a peace, an honorable 
peace, a more than honorable peace, peace that offers them more 
territory, significantly more, one and half times more territory 
than they control at this moment. 
  Therefore, I appeal to you to make new proposals with brief, 
concise speeches -- I have the right to ask that of you as I 
(?was) brief myself -- from among which we will extract one or 
two back-up alternatives for our future actions. Thank you.

  [Excerpt] Belgrade, 16 Jan (TANJUG) -- From 24 January 
Yugoslavs will have a new, convertible dinar, worth one German 
mark. According to the Decree on the New Dinar and the Decree 
on the Dinar Exchange Rate, adopted by the Federal Government 
this evening, the new dinar will be in circulation both in giro 
and in effective form [as received] and can be exchanged for any 
foreign currency. 
  At a news conference after the federal government's session, 
Dragoslav Avramovic, the head of the team of experts which made 
the economic policy programme, and Ratko Banovic, vice governor 
of the National Bank of Yugoslavia, explained to reporters that 
the old, existing dinar will continue to be used in financial 
transactions in the initial period. The rate between the old 
and the new dinar will be defined daily, on the basis of the 
exchange rate between the old dinar and foreign currencies. 
  A fund of $200 million from the National Bank of Yugoslavia 
has been prepared as a foreign exchange support for the first 
emission of the new dinar, scheduled to amount to $100 million.

  [Excerpts] Geneva, Jan 18 (AFP) -- The Moslem-led Bosnian 
Government reacted angrily Tuesday to a UN refusal to back NATO 
air strikes against its opponents as new talks to end the 
21-month-old conflict ran into further roadblocks. With Bosnian 
Serbs retracting a previous offer to give the Moslems a third of 
the former Yugoslav republic in an ethnic carveup, peace 
mediators held out little hope for progress here. 
  "There is no particular reason for optimism," conference 
spokesman John Mills said after the European Community and 
United Nations mediators held separate talks with the warring 
Serbs, Croats and Moslems. 
  The talks coincided with further fighting in Bosnia and 
continuing hand-wringing in the West over its Yugoslavia policy. 
[passage omitted] 
  In the peace negotiations, which resumed here after being 
broken off on December 23 in Brussels, Moslems and Serbs accused 
each other of rejecting the EC peace plan for the ethnic 
division of their country. [passage omitted] 
  Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic called the Serb

  [Text] Geneva, 18 Jan (TANJUG) -- The opening day of the 
Geneva negotiations ended this evening with extremely reserved 
assessments and forecasts by its participants, but with 
agreement that the dialogue be continued tomorrow. 
  Following the conclusion of bilateral negotiations with 
Muslim representatives, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic 
stated that the degree of understanding is "to put it mildly, 
very, very modest." He added that he does not wish to judge it 
in advance, because they agreed to continue the negotiations 
tomorrow. 
  According to Milosevic, the Serb side has practically 
fulfilled European Union demands that the Muslims in Bosnia get 
33.3 percent of the territory, but, as he put it, the Muslim 
side has rejected this. 
  Milosevic said that the conditions exist for this bloody war 
to end, and this is the essence of everything. However, he 
noted that an endless dialogue is being conducted with the 
Muslim delegation, as it has continued to put forward fresh 
demands. "It is high time that peace was signed, after which 
bilateral or trilateral talks on coordinating contentious issues 
can continue," Milosevic said. 
  Referring to a Serbian-Croatian dialogue in the Palais des 
Nations this afternoon, Milosevic said that a high degree of 
understanding was achieved. He added that an identical approach 
to solving the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina exists. 
  Haris Silajdzic, prime minister in the pro-Muslim 
government, 
said that no progress was made in the talks with the Serbian 
side. He found it appropriate to express his regret that the 
"international community and the Western diplomacy do not 
support Bosnia, are maintaining the arms embargo and thus 
enabling an aggression and spread of fascism in Bosnia." 
  Silajdzic stressed that the Muslim side did not put forward 
fresh demands in this round of negotiations, apart from 
insisting on 33.5 percent of the territory and the return of 
"territories seized by force." 
  According to Silajdzic, the biggest concession made by the 
Muslim delegation was that it accepted three ethnic republics 
within a union, to the detriment of keeping an undivided Bosnia.

  [Text] Belgrade, 18 Jan (TANJUG) -- Nikola Koljevic, vice 
president of the republic of Srpska, declared this evening that 
the Muslim delegation had come to the Geneva talks with demands 
that do not accord with the European Union [EU] proposal, and 
added that negotiations outside the framework of this proposal 
are not acceptable to the Serb side. 
  "The Muslims made certain new demands that are not in 
accordance with the existing EU proposal. Talks on this subject 
will resume tomorrow. However, the Serb side is adhering to the 
existing proposals and insists on them, so the talks depend on 
whether the Muslim side will accept the EU proposals or not," 
Koljevic said in an interview for TV Politika. 
  He added that "the Muslims demanded fresh territorial 
concessions beyond the framework of the EU proposal, that is, 
the Franco-German proposal which the Serbs had earlier agreed 
to." 
  "I believe that tomorrow's talks will be decisive. If the 
Muslim side rejects the EU proposals, the Serbs will present a 
new platform," Koljevic concluded.

  [Text] Speaking on the phone line from Geneva, where he is 
taking part in peace negotiations on Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mate 
Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and foreign minister, 
stated for the Croatian radio and television program "TV 
Parliament" this evening that Croatia will put forward a 
proposal to Serbia tomorrow which contains concrete conditions 
for normalizing relations and mutual recognition. It will also 
put forward a proposal to the Bosnian Muslim side on conditions 
for the urgent cessation of all hostilities and elements for 
drawing up internal boundaries. 
  As Minister Granic said, Croatia remains open to 
negotiations 
on the alliance between the two states, and hopes that progress 
will be reached in one of these fields. He also added that it 
is not realistic to expect a final agreement on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to be reached at meetings which are to be 
continued tomorrow. 
  Speaking about the results of negotiations conducted today, 
the Croatian foreign minister stressed that what could be 
considered headway in talks with the Bosnian Muslim side was 
that they have finally put forward draft maps and that they have 
agreed to hold talks on the alliance between the Bosniak Muslim 
republic and the Croat Republic as well as talks on territorial 
settlement within the union of republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
We deem that this was important progress. 
  However, we are not happy with the proposals, but it is 
finally clear what they consider contentious and what their 
proposals to the Croatian side are, Mate Granic said in his 
phone call.

  [Text] Yesterday, on the first day of Geneva peace talks, 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation had many meetings, including 
one with Yasushi Akashi, special envoy of the UN secretary 
general and with the peace conference cochairmen Owen and 
Stoltenberg. On that occasion, our state delegation presented 
the stands established by the Assembly of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The three-hour talks last night between the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation and the delegation of the Serbian 
aggressor, which was headed by Slobodan Milosevic, ended without 
any major results. It was agreed for these talks to resume 
today at 1100. 
  During the talks with the delegation of the Serbian 
aggressor, Alija Izetbegovic, president of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, made remarks about the map that 
was already discussed in the past. All attempts by our official 
to reach a solution for the eastern and western Bosnia, however, 
have hit a barrier of silence in Milosevic's camp. The only 
news during yesterday's meeting was Milosevic's statement that 
the Serbian aggressor's side agreed to Sarajevo's remaining 
under two-year UN administration. 
  The basic problem in last night's talks was in the fact that 
the Serb aggressor's side refuses to meet our delegation's 
demand to give back the territories occupied by force on which 
Muslim Bosniaks constituted majority population before the 
aggression on Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Croatian standpoint with 
regard to Bosnia-Herzegovina is clear. Negotiations can take 
place on the basis of the European Council proposal dated 22 
December and the Brussels conclusions. According to these, 
Croatia should get at least 17.5 percent of the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Muslim proposal which was given to the 
Croats yesterday goes below this -- only 13 percent. This is 
unacceptable to the Croats, it has been learned from the 
Croatian delegation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] As Mirza Hajric, our special correspondent from 
Geneva, reports, talks between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatian 
delegations on open questions with the Croatian side were held 
in Geneva today. Our delegation included Alija Izetbegovic, 
president of the Presidency; Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic; 
Foreign Minister Irfan Ljubijankic; and Muhamed Sacirbey, 
ambassador of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina to the United 
Nations. The Croatian side was represented by Franjo Tudjman, 
Mate Granic, and Mile Akmadzic. 
  The Croatian side presented a very detailed proposal on 
access to the sea for the future Bosnian Republic within the 
union of republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina. According to the 
plan, access to the sea for the Bosnian republics would be on 
the territory of the Peljesac Peninsula, across from the port of 
Ploce. It would extend about 7 km. The length of access on 
land would be about 1.5 km. This involves the region between the 
bays of Serevo and (Ilisa) on Peljesac. 
  The delegation of Bosnia-Herzegovina is to examine this 
proposal. The open question that imposes itself in this case is 
how to get from the port of Ploce to this proposed territory. A 
group of experts has been formed and it started work at 1100. 
  At this meeting with the Croatian delegation the position of 
Mostar was broached. The Croatian side proposes the division of 
Mostar into six local communities, while our delegation insists 
on the whole of Mostar. A problem seems to be Rastani and 
Vracici and also the territory of Mostar airport, which should 
remain within the city region because, as Prime Minister 
Silajdzic pointed out, Mostar could hardly survive without the 
airport. 
  The meeting of experts at 1100 is to discuss the airport 
issue as well, and, as was pointed out, the talks will continue. 
The talks will be resumed in Medjugorje this month, so more 
about these disputed issues will only be known in about two to 
three weeks. 
  The meeting of all three delegations with cochairmen Owen 
and 
Stoltenberg has just begun and the first version of the draft of 
the final agreement is expected to be made. Our correspondent 
Mirza Hajric will present the details of the plenary session at 
our next newscast after the meeting ends.

  [Excerpt] Geneva, 19 Jan (TANJUG) -- The Bosnian peace 
talks resumed this morning in Geneva in an atmosphere of 
complete uncertainty and evident pessimism. As expected, the 
negotiations resumed with bilateral talks between the 
delegations of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia. 
  It has been learned from well-informed sources that in 
addition to debating the resolution of the Bosnian conflict 
there will also be discussions at the negotiating table about 
the normalization of Serbo-Croat relations. It has also been 
learned that this time -- in these talks on normalization -- 
things could go significantly further than intimated earlier.

  [Text] Geneva, 19 Jan (TANJUG) -- The Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia signed a joint 
declaration in Geneva today on the process for the normalization 
of mutual relations and the opening of representative offices of 
their governments in Belgrade and Zagreb. The offices will open 
and begin work on 15 February 1994. 
  A joint statement signed by the two foreign ministers, 
Vladislav Jovanovic and Mate Granic, reads: 
  "The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of 
Croatia, starting from the positive experiences in their joint 
efforts to speed up the peace process to resolve the crisis in 
the area of the former Yugoslavia, and guided by the provisions 
of the UN Charter and the basic documents of the CSCE, and 
aspiring to the establishment of good-neighborly relations, and 
in their desire to contribute in a decisive way to finding a 
just and lasting solution to the crisis in the area of the 
former Yugoslavia -- and to the reestablishment of stability in 
this part of Europe -- agree to embark upon the process of the 
normalization of mutual relations. 
  As a first step in this direction it has been decided to 
open 
in Belgrade and Zagreb official representative offices of the 
two governments -- a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia office in 
Zagreb and an office of the Republic of Croatia in Belgrade. 
  The opening of these offices should ease interstate 
relations 
and contacts, and contribute to the development of mutual trust, 
including the process of the normalization of Serbo-Croat 
relations, in the interest of peace, cooperation and stability 
in the region. 
  The Governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and 
the 
Republic of Croatia will ensure the technical and other 
conditions enabling the offices to work efficiently, work which 
will begin on 15 February 1994."

<F P=106> [Report by Dragan Colovic from Geneva] </F>
  [Text] At exactly 1410 a joint statement was signed here 
in Geneva on the beginning of the process of normalization of 
relations between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] and 
Croatia. This important document was signed by Vladislav 
Jovanovic and Mate Granic, foreign ministers of the FRY and 
Croatia, respectively. The signing ceremony was attended by 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Montenegrin President 
Momir Bulatovic, Radovan Karadzic, president of the republic of 
Srpska, and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. 
  It has been decided that as the first step toward the 
normalization of relations between the FRY and Croatia the two 
governments open representative offices in Zagreb and Belgrade. 
The joint communique states that the opening of the 
aforementioned representative offices will improve relations and 
facilitate contacts between the two states, as well as 
contribute toward mutual trust and the process of normalization 
of Serbian-Croatian relations in the interest of peace, 
cooperation, and stability in the region. The representative 
offices of the FRY in Zagreb and of Croatia in Belgrade will 
commence work on 15 February. 
  It appears that the signing of the aforementioned statement, 
which implies the beginning of the normalization in relations 
between the FRY and Croatia, is so far the only tangible result 
of the very difficult two-day negotiations in Geneva. The 
negotiations will continue this afternoon. 
  Here is what Federal Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic 
stated after the signing of the joint declaration, especially 
for Belgrade Radio: 
  [Begin recording] [Jovanovic] The document that has just 
been signed is an important event and document because it 
sanctions the positive efforts made by the FRY and the Republic 
of Croatia in the current peace process in a positive way, 
especially with regard to the settlement of the Bosnian crisis. 
This document also stresses their determination to establish 
closer bilateral contacts, to establish direct communication 
links in the form of offices, and we are convinced that this 
will help the (?establishment) of peace and the prospects for 
the political settling of all outstanding issues in relations 
between the two countries and the broader region of Yugoslavia. 
  We hope that this statement will have positive effects on 
the 
(?situation) and the settlement of the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, because (?it represents) a sign of political 
goodwill and unity in the efforts of political factors to 
politically overcome the problems that require exclusively 
political solutions and not solutions with force. 
  [Colovic] Mr. Jovanovic, how do you assess the two-day talks 
in Geneva? 
  [Jovanovic] They are very complex, very slow, and contain 
many anachronisms, especially by the Muslim delegation, which 
has obviously come here with the intention not to sign peace but 
to make it more complicated, that is, to make its realization 
more difficult. This is the most negative moment in the work so 
far. On the contrary, however, there are continuous efforts, 
efforts made by the cochairmen and the Serbian and the Croatian 
sides. Thanks to this, one could say that there are still some 
chances of saving the peace process this afternoon and evening, 
and if we can be optimists without having much reason to be, to 
bring this process closer to an end. 
  [Colovic] Thank you Mr. Jovanovic. 
  [Jovanovic] Thank you. [end recording]

  [Text] United Nations, Jan 18 (AFP) -- UN officials have 
begun studying the possibility of using ground troops in 
conjunction with air strikes to help reopen a key airport in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, officials said Tuesday. A letter from 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to the Security Council 
obtained by AFP said he had ordered his special envoy Yasushi 
Akashi to draft contingency plans for the besieged cities of 
Tuzla and Srebrenica. 
  "It was clear that other military assets would also be 
required, as the use of air power, or the threat of its use, 
could not alone achieve the desired objectives," Butrus-Ghali 
said in the letter. "I have instructed Mr. Akashi to prepare 
forthwith detailed plans for military operations, with the use 
of air power as required" to reopen the airport in Tuzla and 
ensure a Canadian troop contingent in Srebrenica can be relieved. 
  However in the same letter, Butrus-Ghali said he had 
received 
a letter from Russia which repeated its position that no 
military action be taken in the former Yugoslavia without 
consultations with the Security Council. Russia as a permenant 
member of the Security Council has the right of veto. 
  Akashi said in a report to the secretary general that use of 
air power -- as suggested at last week's NATO conference -- 
would be inadequate if not accompanied by a stronger presence on 
the ground. 
  UN officials in Geneva said the Bosnian Serbs had already 
agreed to the replacement of some 180 Canadian troops stranded 
for six months in Srebrenica, making military action 
unnecessary. Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, quoted by 
the Yugoslav TANJUG news agency, said his self-styled parliament 
had decided the Dutch could take the Canadians' place "as of 
tomorrow" provided they were "the same number and with the same 
weapons." 
  But Therese Gastaut, spokeswoman for Butrus-Ghali, said the 
rotation would not take place before the second half of 
February. There was no immediate explanation for the delay. 
  In refusing to allow the reopening of Tuzla Airport, closed 
since May 1992 by Serb shelling from the surrounding hills, 
Karadzic said the facility "would only be used to rearm the 
Moslems." Karadzic said all of Bosnia's airports should be 
reopened "but in no case before signing a peace treaty."

  [Text] In a statement, the Democratic Youth Forum, the 
Albanian Students Independent Union, the student wing of the 
Albanian Democratic Party, and the Political Persecutees Youth 
League express their deep indignation and strong protest against 
the Serbian occupying authorities in Prishtina who, 
provocatively and intentionally, have arrested the chairman of 
the Independent Students Union of Prishtina University, Fisnik 
Cukaj. 
  They appeal to all European youth bodies to raise their 
voices to defend their Kosovar counterparts and exert pressure 
so that Fisnik Cukaj and others are not murdered by the Serbian 
dictatorship but can enjoy the legitimate right of European 
citizens.

<F P=106> [Eli Paloka article: "Campaign of Deception by Belgrade's </F>
Bootlickers"] 
  [Text] On 15 January some of the Democratic Alliance [AD] 
leaders organized a political meeting in Shkoder. Various 
sources report this to have been a "meeting of selected 
intellectuals" aspiring for pure democracy and political ethics. 
However, this meeting used the language of gutter politics. As 
at all meetings of this kind, politicians are at pains to air 
their ideas and beliefs, while the audience is ready to hear the 
alternatives offered to them and choose between them. Some may 
approve of what a political group says, and some may not, 
because an audience has its own preferences on various issues; 
that is democracy. Unfortunately, the AD leaders, once so 
determined to defend diversity of opinion within the Democratic 
Party, did not permit any reply to the insults and deceptions 
they hurled into the auditorium. The result was that a 
26-year-old man became the victim of a crime that was in any 
event intolerable. How was the quarrel that concluded in 
Gjovalin Cekini's murder provoked? Well known for their 
bombastic statements and deceptions, the AD leaders exploited 
the platform to spit venom against those who govern the Albanian 
state today. Not only this, but reports state that their desire 
to oppose everything that the Albanian state does today has led 
them into new political blunders. Thus, following (baseless) 
accusations that "today's rulers are sunk in corruption" (and it 
was G. Pashko who said this), or accusations against S. Berisha, 
the AD leaders came out in defense of Nano (they once voted 
against him). Nevertheless, it is said that the culmination 
earns with the statements made about Serbia. "We have neither 
ever killed the Serbs nor have they killed us." Meanwhile, "the 
democratic government tied us to the Muslims and spoiled our 
relations with our neighbors." It seems that the "bootlickers'" 
visit to Belgrade was not simply an aberration on the part of 
the AD's leaders. Imami said that "we went to Belgrade to avert 
war." Is it not a wonder that what the whole of Europe has not 
managed to avert was averted by the AD with the powerful 
assistance of N. Hoti? Anything can be done with the "youthful 
optimism" of the AD leaders and N. Hoti's cosmic intelligence. 
  Annoyed by such statements, some of the people in the hall 
responded and objected. This also happened because the AD 
leaders did not reply to all the questions put to them in 
writing, and the police intervened. 
  After the objections, the hall erupted in confusion. The 
irritated section of the audience, about half of it, who could 
no longer put up with the insults and deceptions about the 
"blank check," went outside. Meanwhile, others departed at the 
end of the meeting and followed, from the theater to the Radio 
Shkoder building, the person who had argued with the meeting's 
chairmen, hitting him. Some of the latter's friends were 
nearby, and a quarrel between the two sides broke out. One of 
them was armed, and fired at the victim in the course of the 
quarrel. Thus, a 26-year-old became the victim of the AD's 
hooligan politics. The responsible authorities must investigate 
this tragic incident. It seems that the deputies without an 
electorate have begun a campaign of deception in support of the 
call for new elections issued by the Socialist Party leaders. 
  They have stated that they might win 15-20 percent in the 
next elections, but if they continue in this way they will only 
increase the number of their opponents.

<F P=106> [Statement by the Democratic Alliance issued in Tirana on 15 </F>
January: "We Accuse the Democratic Party's Government of a 
Renewed 2 April in Shkoder"] 
  [Text] The failed attempt by a group organized by the 
Democratic Party [PD] to disrupt the Democratic Alliance [AD] 
meeting with the Shkoder electorate in the Migjeni Theater in 
the city of Shkoder on 14 January ended tragically in the 
shooting by PD provocateurs of Gjovalin Cekini, a 26-year-old AD 
member. On the basis of the fact that this fascist act is a 
result of the state's oppressive policies against the AD as the 
most determined and credible opposition group, seeing here a 
dangerous escalation of the mthods of political struggle used by 
the ruling party, and convinced that the Albanian nation has 
chosen the path of tolerance and dialogue in building democracy, 
the AD accuses: 
  1. the ruling PD of organizing systematic verbal and 
physical violence against the AD, illegally making use of the 
institutions of the Albanian state; 
  -- the parliament of limiting political and other freedoms 
in Albania by not recognizing the AD parliamentary group and by 
approving antidemocratic laws; 
  -- Radio-Television, which is used as an instrument of 
verbal 
violence against the AD, of not giving the AD a single 
opportunity to speak for itself; 
  -- the National Intelligence Service of placing under 
surveillance and attempting to frame AD leaders; 
  -- the police of being under orders to tear down AD 
propaganda posters. 
  The PD's orders are to persecute and dismiss from their jobs 
AD members and sympathizers and to paralyze its normal politics 
activity, impeding it by means of hooliganism. 
  2. The AD accuses PD Deputy Chairman Ali Spahiu of being the 
direct organizer of the group of hooligans and criminals that 
intervened illegally, disrupted the AD meeting in Shkoder, and 
finally carried out the murder of Gjovalin Cekini. 
  3. The AD accuses Sali Berisha, president of the republic, 
by approving similar activities by the same group at the time of 
the Socialist Party leader's visit to the same city a few months 
ago, of encouraging the deeds of these criminals who commuted 
this murder with his name in their mouths. 
  4. The AD accuses Prime Minister Meksi and his government, 
by putting the state authorities under the PD and the influence 
of criminals, of paralyzing the capacities of the forces of 
order and the law, thus becoming responsible for a new 2 April 
in Shkoder. This government, with its illegal privatization, is 
supporting criminals and thieves to create support for its rule. 
  5. The AD accuses Albanian Radio-Television and its 
directors Skender Bucpapaj and Qemal Sakajeva of inspiring a 
climate of hostility and terror through its attacks and slanders 
against the AD and its portrayal on the screen of hooligans as 
heroes in obstructing the political activities of parties. 
  The AD informs the Albanian public that the killing of 
Gjovalin Cekini is the murder of one of their sons who had 
struggled for true democracy and human rights since before 
December 1990. The AD calls on Albanians not to forget this 
name, not to be scared by hooligans and criminals, and not to 
retreat a single step on the road on which we embarked in 
December 1990. The AD calls on its members and supporters 
throughout Albania to continue on the road of democracy through 
dialogue and peaceful methods, to keep cool heads, and to avoid 
all kinds of provocations intended to encourage violent 
reactions. Dialogue and tolerance are our weapons. The use of 
guns and terror of any kind will end in failure. In the hope 
that ideals of December still occupy a place in the minds and 
hearts of those in power and of ordinary PD members, the AD 
calls on these people to dissociate themselves from the world of 
crime and corruption that surrounds them. The AD wishes to draw 
the attention of the European Community and democratic states to 
the need to help and support Albania, asking them to call on 
President Berisha and Prime Minister Meksi to respect democratic 
standards in Albania.

<F P=106> ["Observer" article: "The Leftwing Extremists' Campaign Is </F>
in Defense of Ramiz and Fatos"] 
  [Text] The instigators of the Shkoder incident linked by 
many ties with the world of Crimet after harvesting the tragic 
"fruits" of their meeting in this city with a murder are still 
not resting in their continual statements, each more absurd than 
the last, in the belief that they will thereby make themselves 
important. Neritan Ceka, known among the people as Neritan 
Alia, the bootlicker of Milosevic and the denouncer of Astrit 
Qorri, thinks that his declarations make him credible. Aware 
that he is branded for many reasons, he thinks that he might 
ease the burden on himself. It is no use. No water can cleanse 
his sins nor those who surround him. In mid-January, Shkoder was 
added to these sins. The Shkoder incident is a continuation of 
their pro-Serb policy, after the pro-Serb exposition made in the 
hall, and is an indictment of them in every way. It is the 
Serbs and their Allies who want the destabilization of Albania, 
an Albania exhausted by civil war, and an Albania divided on 
religious lines, to achieve their anti-Albanian aims, easily 
delivering a fatal blow to democracy in stir country in order to 
settle accounts in Kosova. It is the Serbs and their allies who 
are distressed by the trial according to democratic justice of 
Ramiz Alia and Fatos Nano, the spawn and successors of Enver, 
who served the Serbs and their allies until his end. These and 
other related motives also explain what happened recently in 
Shkoder and, in general, the whole campaign of the left-wing 
extremists against democracy and the democratic regime in 
Albania. They are attempting in this way to rescue Ramiz Alias 
Fates Nano, and others who collaborated in their crimes, theft, 
and corruption. However, these wretches have erred in their 
calculations. The justice which put their godfathers in their 
places will not find it difficult to deal with their vassals and 
bootlickers, with adventurers who show no sense of 
responsibility for the destiny of the country and the people.

<F P=106> [Interview with Democratic Alliance General Secretary Arben </F>
Imami by Erion Brace in Tirana on 15 January: "Imami Declares: 
This Is a Typically Fascist Murder"] 
  [Text] Yesterday two Albanian newspapers, ZERI I POPULLIT 
and KOHA JONE, reported the murder at about 1500 of the 
26-year-old Gjovalin Cekini in the city of Shkoder. In its 
report, KOHA JONE reported Mr. Imami's view that "The Alliance 
paid in blood for a peaceful meeting." According to Mr. Imami, 
Cjovalin Cekimi was a member of the Democratic Alliance [AD], 
and a participant at the meeting. 
  In connection with this shocking incident, I turned to Mr. 
Arben Imami, AD general secretary. 
  [Brace] The spokesman of the Public Order Ministry late last 
night, and today's newspapers, reported a murder in the city of 
Shkoder yesterday. Because there is little information in the 
newspapers and the Public Order Ministry's report, please add 
something. 
  [Imami] The Public Order Ministry's report is strange, 
because the background of the incident and its aim and purpose 
were political. The Public Order Ministry does not normally 
report the dozens of murders that take place in Albania, but 
this time it did, saying that this was an ordinary murder with 
nothing to do with the political background I am talking about. 
In brief, the chronological course of events was as follows: 
While we were holding our meeting, about 2030 members of the 
Democratic Party [PD] who work in the local PD presidium 
entered. Not receiving the support with which they intended to 
break up the meeting, they stood up following an order and 
demonstratively left the hall, shouting the basest insults and 
slanders. Our people were aroused, and an incident could have 
occurred. Aware of this, together with Mr. Gjerjgj Zefi, the 
assembly's deputy chairman, we called on our party's members and 
supporters not to fall for this provocation. We continued the 
meeting in an entirely normal fashion for another 30 minutes. 
When the people left the hall, and obviously those who had 
remained behind were AD members and supporters, the murder 
occurred. According to eyewitness descriptions, a car arrived 
and stopped in front of the Migjeni Theater. Its engine was 
left running, and someone got out to meet someone else in a 
Toyota with an official license-plate. At this moment, the 
people from the hall arrived, and this person turned to the 
participant in the meeting, saying "Whoever insults Sali Berisha 
is a so-and-so, and does such-and- such." A minor conflict then 
followed; the person in question had the revolver he used for 
the attack constantly drawn. Other people tried to hold him 
back, stop him, and calm him, and then he committed his crime 
against a member of our party [words illegible] were together 
and included the one who commuted the crime, and whose names are 
known although one must wait for the ministry to issue them, at 
least one can already be said, here in Tirana without going to 
Shkoder to check, to be one of the main protagonists of the 
provocation inside the meeting hall. 
  The plan was very clear. They entered the meeting to disrupt 
it, failed in this, went outside, organized themselves, decided 
to do something, came with the car, left the car engine running, 
and commuted the crime, while the car drove off and the murderer 
escaped on foot. The criminals have still not been detained, 
although, as the police say, they have been identified. 
  To my mind, this is a murder, a second 2 April. The PD, 
which was the party that fought against violence and for freedom 
and democracy, is the party that today organizes all the 
counter- rallies, mounts provocations, and is creating an 
atmosphere of political crime. We have felt that political 
crimes were impending. I have even asked in the parliament, "Why 
do you not play the game politically, but play with life and 
death?" However, we will accept this game, and are ready to 
reply with our lives. The PD, having been the party of the 
struggle against crime, has become a party that organizes crime 
at all levels. The corruption that has enveloped the entire PD 
will naturally result in crime. 
  Berisha too has particular responsibility, starting from 
the earlier incident when he asked what the Socialists wanted in 
Shkoder. One could say the same of anybody: What does the AD 
want in Shkoder? What do the Republicans want in Shkoder? -- 
as if Shkoder belonged only to the PD or to Sali Berisha. 
Meanwhile, strong feeling against Sali Berisha has arisen in 
Shkoder. We will exploit this mood against him. For the 
television and ATA, which daily issue statements calling the 
people of our party spies and mercenary dogs, and for a party 
fanatic who is also corrupt, the idea of defending certain 
values and murder [passage illegible] is clearly prepared and 
wound up morally, psychologically, and politically. 
  [Brace] Mr. Imami, why this time against the AD? 
  [Imami] We must realize that Shkoder is a citadel of 
democracy. Shkoder is a city of anticommunism, a city of 
freedom. Shkoder is a city of serious religious belief (I am not 
talking here about religious intolerance). Shkoder after all is 
a city, and the PD wanted to preserve its monopoly at least in 
Shkoder. It has no doubt conclusively lost its monopoly in 
Albania, but it wanted to at least preserve its monopoly in 
Shkoder, and our meeting there, with its substance, support, and 
splendid level of participation, no doubt touched its nerve. 
However, I will say one thing that we must remember. One of 
the murderers, one of the group, was a person who expects to 
gain something from privatization, at a time when we are 
speaking out against this privatization, which is a form of 
theft. Thus, the general political interests of this party 
coincide with the specific economic interests of corrupt 
individuals. Thus there is a combination of general and 
personal interests that leads to crime. 
  [Brace] What will you do now? 
  [Imami] It is a little early to talk about further action; 
we must not behave overhastily. We have a political 
responsibility because this person was one of our people and we 
stand by him. We did not succeed in protecting him against this 
fascist state while he was alive. This murder is typically 
fascist, because only fascists murder political activists and 
disrupt political demonstrations by such means. To come back to 
the question, I say that the party will defend this issue to the 
end, and we will explain calmly and without haste the means that 
we will employ. We will issue a statement at a news conference 
tomorrow. We will send a memorandum to European institutions. 
We will call on the members of our party not to retreat a 
single step in this issue and will plan our political action to 
the last detail: no retreat toward a restriction of freedom, 
toward a restriction of rights, no retreat when faced with this 
state of violence and organized crime.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Stefan Dimitrov, chief of President </F>
Zhelev's Military Office, by Lyubomir Denov; place and date not 
given: "General Stefan Dimitrov: The President Cannot Send 
Tanks"] 
  [Text] [Denov] General Dimitrov, is there a decree that 
regulates the functions of the president's Military Office, and 
if there is one, why was it not published? 
  [Dimitrov] There really is such a decree and it is not such 
a terrible thing. It is not a secret. The head of state does 
not issue secret decrees. If it has not been published up until 
now, it is a result of the Presidency's internal order. 
  [Denov] Why did you write the letter that explains the 
prerogatives of the Military Office to the Army chiefs? 
  [Dimitrov] It was a high time to specify the status of the 
Military Office. Since we mainly work with the Ministry of 
Defense and the General Staff, Minister Aleksandrov and General 
Petrov had to be informed. Democracy requires elements of 
organization, order, and discipline. The decree outlines the 
prerogatives of the Military Office, while the letter defines 
the order of mutual relations between the working entities of 
the two institutions. If someone is disturbed by regulating 
relations, then let him say so publicly and explain himself. 
  [Denov] Was this coordinated with the prime minister? 
  [Dimitrov] I find it difficult to answer this, because I did 
not attend all the meetings between the president and the prime 
minister. 
  [Denov] Did you seek the opinion of the defense minister and 
the General Staff chief on the matters invoked in the letter? 
  [Dimitrov] Of course. We had a joint discussion before the 
president signed the letter. Different opinions were expressed 
during the discussion about various formulations of the draft 
letter. Afterward, the disputed elements were eliminated. 
  [Denov] Is it true that the chief of the General Staff 
sharply reacted against this letter? 
  [Dimitrov] You must ask General Lyuben Petrov about that. 
This way, we, too, would learn what his objections are regarding 
anything related to the prerogatives of the president's Military 
Office. 
  [Denov] Do you have a good relationship with Minister 
Aleksandrov and General Petrov? 
  [Dimitrov] In their activities, the minister of defense, the 
General Staff chief, and the Military Office must be guided by 
the Constitution and the country's laws. 
  [Denov] Does it mean that the president's Military Office 
obtains leading functions in anything related to the Army? 
  [Dimitrov] Of course not. The speculations about the 
prerogatives of the Military Office date back to the first day 
of its establishment. We have refuted various rumors several 
times. You only have to look at the letter to become convinced. 
It explicitly points out that the Military Office has no 
leading and control functions vis-a-vis the General Staff and 
the Bulgarian Army. In addition it points out that the Military 
Office assists the president as a supreme commander in chief in 
implementing his prerogatives by collecting, analyzing, and 
summing up information. 
  [Denov] According to the letter, is the information that the 
Military Office will receive from the Army leading entities not 
too serious in anything related to its scope and secrecy? Does 
this information provide the opportunity to practically activate 
the Army above the heads of the Defense Ministry and the General 
staff? 
  [Dimitrov] No. At first glance, the information that the 
letter specifies is voluminous, but the frequency of preparing 
and sending it varies. Please note that the letter talks about 
copies of documents circulated in the General Staff and the 
Defense Ministry. Not a single document will be specially 
prepared for us. The hint that such information could be 
utilized in order to activate the Army is food for naive people. 
Placing the Army in various degrees of combat readiness is 
strictly regulated in the military's hierarchic structure and is 
absolutely impossible as someone's self-initiative. This also 
applies to the president's Military Office. Only specific 
members of the General Staff can place Army units in a state of 
combat readiness. 
  [Denov] What document regulates the existence of the 
president's Military Office? 
  [Dimitrov] The Military Office was established on the basis 
of Article 102, Paragraph 3, Item 5 of the Bulgarian 
Constitution, which allows the president to determine the order 
and organization of the services that act next to him. 
  [Denov] Since you say that the information about the letter 
was released in a biased manner, could you say who is behind 
this affair? 
  [Dimitrov] Those are people who do not care about the 
country's security, democracy, or proper relations between the 
state institutions. This is another attempt to drive a wedge 
between the state institutions' working entities. Those people 
compromise themselves and demonstrate elementary incompetence 
and legal nihilism. I think that this is another attempt to 
destabilize the situation in the country.

<F P=106> [Rosa Popova report: "Discussion About the Western </F>
Outlands"] 
  [Text] The situation of the Bulgarian minority in the 
Western Outlands [in southeastern Serbia] is a controversial and 
crucial problem for Bulgaria. As a result of political 
assimilation, the fate of those compatriots is not enviable, as 
noted in a recent discussion organized by the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party [BSP] Supreme Council's Commission on Ethnic and 
National Issues. Representatives of the "Western Outlands" 
Union, of the Orthodox Church, and of the U.S. Embassy in Sofia 
participated in the meeting. 
  After nearly 70 years of neglect, the problem of the Western 
Outlands is regaining prominence in the eyes of the public, 
Prof. Momchil Todorov, chairman of the "Western Outlands" Union, 
declared. In talking about assimilation we should not imply that 
the number of Bulgarians in those areas is diminishing, but we 
should take into account the emerging pro-Yugoslav trends and 
the alienation from their Bulgarian roots and traditions. 
Nevertheless, in discussing such delicate relations, we should 
manifest great tolerance for the Republic of Serbia, academician 
Ilcho Dimitrov pointed out in his statement. The question of 
the Western Outlands should be dealt with in the context of a 
general concept on the national question as a whole, Prof. 
Dimitrov added. The fundamental solution of this issue and of 
all other problems related to the situation of our compatriots 
living abroad should be part of a comprehensive Bulgarian state 
policy on the national question. 
  By opening up a similar discussion about all the crucial 
problems related to the so-called Macedonian issue, as well as 
to the situation of our emigres in Bessarabia and Moldova, the 
BSP intends to submit a special document related to state policy 
on the national question.

Nikolov Popinski was dismissed today from the post of chief of 
the Defense Ministry's Department for Supplies and Trade. Col. 
Popinski was said to have committed gross violations in 
connection with poor control of the fulfillment of contracts and 
had signed contracts unilaterally, to the detriment of the 
Defense Ministry. 
  According to the Defense Ministry announcement, for the same 
reasons Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov has ordered the 
dismissal from active military service on disciplinary grounds 
of Colonel Engineer Stoyan Tsvetkov Tsakov, deputy chief of the

  [Text] We will wage the campaign against corruption in the 
Army mercilessly and uncompromisingly -- this is the categorical 
view of Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov. 
  An announcement by the Defense Ministry Press Center states 
that facts have been established confirming gross violations 
during the recent allocation of housing that began on 11 
January, connected with certain people enriching themselves at 
the expense of others. 
  The announcement further states that a group of 30 officers 
from the Sofia Garrison came to see the defense minister and 
explained to him their complaints. Their complaints had also 
been deposited with the commission supervising sales at the 
Sofia Garrison. Despite explicit instructions issued by 
Minister Aleksandrov, the commission chairman, Colonel Georgi 
Vutov, adopted a rude, unceremonious attitude toward the senior 
and junior officers. The defense minister went in person to the 
place were the commission sits and immediately dismissed Colonel 
Vutov from active military service for violations in carrying 
out the duties entrusted to him. The minister also ordered the 
replacement of all the members of the commission.

<F P=106> [Report by K.B.: "Inflation Acceleration"] </F>
  [Text] The average net salary in the enterprise sector was 
4,312,100 zlotys in December. That figure is 15.6-percent 
higher than in November. At the same time, according to the 
Central Office of Statistics [GUS], the prices of consumer goods 
and services rose by 5.6 percent; food prices increased by 8.9 
percent. In all of 1993 (from December to December), net 
salaries increased by 34.4 percent, whereas consumer prices rose 
by 37.6 percent. 
  Comparison of the salary and price increases shows that in 
all of 1993, real wages in the enterprise sector dropped by 3.2 
percent. In the last three months (December to September) [as 
published], net salaries in enterprises increased by 26.5 
percent; at the same time, consumer prices rose by 11.9 percent. 
Thus, in the last quarter, real wages in enterprises went up by 
14.6 percent. This creates the very real danger of more rapid 
inflation in the first few months of 1994. 
  GUS also reported on Monday [17 January] that there were 
2,889,600 registered unemployed people in December, 1.5 percent 
more than in November. The official unemployment rate in 
December was 15.7 percent.

  [Text] London, Jan 19 (AFP) -- Bosnia's ambassador to the 
UN Mohammed Sacirbey strongly criticized Wednesday [19 January] 
France's decision to recall its outspoken UN commander in former 
Yugoslavia and accused the UN of wanting to maintain the status 
quo in his war-torn country. 
  "It seems that what certain people within the UN system try 
to do is always always find a new fresh general not as creative 
as the previous one," Sacirbery said during a BBC interview. "It 
seems any time a commander in Bosnia finally is convinced that 
the status quo needs to change, that's when someone decides the 
commander himself needs to be changed." Sacirbey was reacting 
to France's annoucement Tuesday that it was pulling out General 
Jean Cot from ex-Yugoslavia by the end of March and replacing 
him with another general. 
  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali had asked for Cot 
to 
be replaced before his mandate ends on June 30 and had 
criticized the general for asking to be given the power to order 
air strikes. Sacirbey said Western powers have continously 
overlooked their stated commitment to Bosnia. "It seems 
everyone is eager to forget the commitments made by NATO (North 
Atlantic Treaty Organisation)," he said. 
  According to a UN Security Council resolution adopted in May 
1993 Butrus-Ghali is the only person that can call for NATO air 
strikes in former Yugoslavia.

  [Text] Geneva, Jan 18 (AFP) -- The International Committee 
of the Red Cross on Tuesday [18 January] suspended indefinitely 
its relief operations in the area of Banja Luka in Bosnia after 
an bomb destroyed one of its vehicles. A spokesman in the 
Serb-controlled town told AFP that the vehicle had been blown up 
early Tuesday outside an apartment of two ICRC employees but the 
blast caused no casualties. "This attack raises serious 
problems of security," said Pierre Gauthier, an ICRC spokesman 
in Geneva. Loyal authorities have opened an enquiry into the 
attack, the spokesman said. The ICRC has about 25 workers in 
the northwestern town, which is a base for supplying both Moslem 
and Serb populations in the area.

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The members of the [Sarajevo] 
City Council have assessed the latest round of humanitarian aid 
as one of the worst so far. That is why a meeting was organized 
yesterday with Tony Land, chief of the UNHCR office in Sarajevo. 
Mayor Muhamed Kresevljakovic asked Mr. Land whether the obvious 
reduction in the humanitarian aid represented yet another form 
of pressure on the Bosnia-Herzegovina authorities, and whether 
the UNHCR had merged with the European underworld, which 
normally resorted to such tactics. 
  Tony Land vehemently rejected this, justifying the 
increasingly poor deliveries to the Saralians by the wintry 
conditions, which limit the number of flights, by the frequent 
firing at UNHCR aircraft, and the lack of land corridors. The 
representatives of the city authorities proposed to Land that on 
one day no flour should be brought into the city, but instead 
all the flights should be used to bring proteins and sugar into 
Sarajevo. Land said that he had no say in the kind of goods 
that were delivered by air. 
  All in all, the meeting with the chief of the Sarajevo UNHCR 
office was assessed as unsatisfactory. That is why the members 
of the Sarajevo City Council have sent another letter from 
today's session to UNHCR's Sadako Ogata, in which they inform 
her about the very difficult humanitarian situation in Sarajevo, 
asking her to do something improve it. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Alija Behran from Mostar] </F>
  [Excerpts] Convoys of expelled Bosniak Muslims are again 
arriving from the western part of Mostar, which is partly 
controlled by Boban's Ustasha units and partly by the Croatian 
Army, in a new wave of ethnic cleansing of the non-Croatian 
population. Two nights ago, the defenders of the city received 
six of our fellow citizens on the demarcation line in the 
People's Revolution Boulevard [Bulevar Narodne Revolucije]. 
They were ruthlessly expelled by HVO fighters late at night, 
without even being allowed to take with them the most basic 
belongings. At 1330 today, another six people -- mostly women, 
children, and old folk -- arrived in the eastern, free part of 
the city across the [word indistinct] bridge from the direction 
of the airport [word indistinct]. They were forcefully evicted 
from their homes. Boban's fighters came wearing hoods over 
their heads, these expelled Mostar people told me, with the 
obvious motive of looting and moving into other people's homes. 
[passage omitted] 
  The [Mostar] War Presidency sees this latest wave of ethnic 
cleansing of the Bosniak Muslims from the western part of Mostar 
as part of the long-term project to change completely the 
demographic structure of the Neretva River Valley. The final 
outcome is to have a Croatian majority in the Mostar commune and 
the Neretva River Valley, who would then -- in the final stage 
of breaking up Bosnia-Herzegovina -- decide in a referendum to 
live in the Croatian state. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Colonel General Ante Roso, HVO </F>
Command Center commander; place and date not given: "We Have 
Defended the Vitez-Busovaca Corridor!"] 
  [Text] The reason for the interview with Colonel General 
Ante Roso, commander of the Command Center of the Croat Defense 
Council [HVO], was the continued Muslim aggression against Croat 
areas in central Bosnia. This was his first exclusive interview 
for SLOBODNA DALMACIJA following the negotiations between 
Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic in Bonn. 
  [SLOBODNA DALMACIJA] In spite of the latest negotiations 
between Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic, we heard on Tuesday 
morning [11 January] that the Muslim army was continuing the 
attacks on the HVO troops in central Bosnia. 
  [Roso] Yes, this information is correct. The Muslim army 
continued the attacks on Croat territories at Vitez, Novi 
Travnik, and Busovaca. It is certain, which the information 
from the ground has confirmed, that the Muslims will not be give 
up their ambitions. Apart from attacking almost all our defense 
lines, they are also preparing new attacks. We know that their 
plans to attack Kiseljak have been completed. 
  [SLOBODNA DALMACIJA] How do the HVO troops respond to this, 
and what is the current situation in central Bosnia? 
  [Roso] We respond the way we have to in order to survive. 
We can only survive by fighting and defending ourselves. I 
would say that we Croats have a genetic will to survive, but 
also the will for peace, and certainty about success, because we 
know that what we are defending belongs to us. I can say that I 
am impressed by the willingness and morale of my troops, which 
have warded off all aggressor attacks. 
<H5>  Saving the Hostages </H5>
  [SLOBODNA DALMACIJA] Is the information that the Muslims 
have managed to cut off the communication between Vitez and 
Busovaca, true? 
  [Roso] This information is incorrect. What is correct is 
that they had occupied several houses, but our troops, in a 
counterattack, retrieved the lost positions at Buhine Kuce. I 
must point out that the members of the English battalion, whom 
we had had several complaints about, this time helped us get out 
the civilians, which we are very grateful about. During the 
last Muslim attacks at the area of Buhine Kuce, the Muslim army, 
reinforced by some 200 foreigners from Islamic countries, took 
away 35 hostages, most of whom are women. We are doing 
everything to save these hostages and find out what happened to 
the 72 missing Croats from Krizancevo Selo. 
  [SLOBODNA DALMACIJA] You have said that, during the attack 
at Buhine Kuce, the MOS [Muslim Defense Forces] had been 
reinforced by foreigners from Islamic countries. We would like 
to know how they get to the Muslim areas in Bosnia. 
  [Roso] They are transferred in various ways by humanitarian 
convoys. 
  [SLOBODNA DALMACIJA] Ground reports speak of the Muslims 
having violated international rules of war. What does this 
concern? 
  [Roso] They do violate all the rules of war. In the attacks 
at Krizancevo Selo, Lazine, and now at Buhine Kuce, but also 
elsewhere, they were using active chemical substances and poison 
gases. To protect themselves, our defenders as well as the 
civilian population have to use masks and wet cloths during the 
Muslim attacks. These are superhuman efforts, and I am sure 
that the resistance of the Croats of central Bosnia is 
representative of the Croat national struggle. It is an example 
of Croat sacrifice and togetherness. I believe in them, and 
would like to use this opportunity to tell them to hold on and 
that there are no changes of what I promised them in Kiseljak. 
My goal is to preserve the Croatian people, and I will use 
every available means to prevent the enemy, whatever they may be 
called, from pushing us out of our historically Croatian 
territories. Regardless of the many enemies, Croats have no 
choice; they have to defend their territories in Bosnia. 
<H5>  A Message to the Croats </H5>
  [SLOBODNA DALMACIJA] Is that a message to the Croatian 
defenders and Croatian people in central Bosnia? 
  [Roso] Not only to them, but to all Croatian people. I would 
like to use this opportunity to invite all Croats to help in the 
defense of Croatian territories in Bosnia, because without these 
territories there is no Croatia. I would like to appeal to 
Croats abroad, from the United States and Canada to Australia, 
to help the Croatian people's just fight in Herceg-Bosna through 
promotional activities. I would like to tell them not to conduct 
politics in bars. There is no such thing as a political 
prescription, but there is such thing as concept [as published], 
which is appearing with united forces. My motto is `Viribus 
unitis'. The Americans, Germans, and other nations have 
realized that. Everyone has, except some of our fanatics, and 
it would be good if they were imitated, if only once. I feel bad 
about not having political cohesion and political culture when 
it comes to the Croatian people. 
  [SLOBODNA DALMACIJA] After the negotiations between 
Presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic, what will be the reactions 
of the Croats in Herceg-Bosna? 
  [Roso] The Croats will again respect all international 
decisions, although every time we have presented the 
geostrategic reality in the Balkans, the international community 
has not taken it seriously. I find it very strange and hard to 
understand the actions of our old Europe, which has failed to 
understand that this is a realistic political time in which the 
Croatian people are demanding their share of the European 
equation. I would also like to say that in this war of the 
Muslim army against the Croatian people there has also been 
extremist Islamic fascism, which is a threat to Europe itself. 
I would not like to be misunderstood. The Muslims as a people 
are not a problem; it is only some of them who are inclined 
toward this extremist Islamic fascism, which now appears in a 
new context. The Muslim leaders must realize that in these 
areas there can be no other reality except a contemporary 
European one. 
<H5>  [Box, p 7] </H5>
<H5>  Heroic Fighting </H5>
  "In Croatia, especially in the Croatian media, there is 
little emphasis on the problems of Croats in the besieged 
enclaves, who have not received any aid in months. There is 
also little talk of the crimes committed against the Croats of 
Herceg-Bosna. It hurts me that there is so little mention of 
the heroic Croatian fighting in the besieged enclaves around 
Turija, Zepce, Vares, and Usora. These people and the brigades 
that will not give up a meter of their territory to the enemy 
should be congratulated." 
<H5>  The Franciscans </H5>
  "I would like to ask the Franciscans of Bosna Srebrena to 
once again show determination in saving the Croatian people in 
Bosnia. They have done so many times in history, and at this 
moment the Croatian people in Herceg-Bosna expect them to do it 
again. We especially need them to help us with food, because 
our people in central Bosnia are hungry." 
<H5>  The Arrows </H5>
  "I hold the arrows of Croatian youth in my hand. Naturally, 
I do not use them. My goal is to preserve each Croatian life, 
as well as the Croatian people. I will do everything to stop 
the exodus of Croats."

  [Excerpt] Sarajevo, Jan 18 (AFP) -- The humanitarian 
situation is "alarming" in central Bosnia and "desperate" in the 
besieged Moslem-held town of Maglaj, in the north, a UN official 
said here Tuesday [18 January]. For the third day running 
Tuesday aid convoys headed from the Adriatic to central Bosnia 
had to be called off because roads were blocked by demonstrating 
civilians in Moslem-held areas, UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR) spokesman Kris Janowski said here. 
  On Monday, some 300 people held up a food convoy between 
Zenica and Kakanj, central Bosnia, and police had to fire into 
the air to disperse them, he said. Last week, three UNHCR 
convoys were attacked in Moslem-held areas, notably between 
Gornji Vakuf and Novi Travnik, and a British armoured vehicle 
had to fire into the air to disperse civilians, the spokesman 
also said. UNHCR representatives suggested civilians were angry 
at the way food was distributed by the Bosnian authorities.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Foreign Minister Irfan Ljubljancic </F>
by Jamil Rufa'il in Skopje and Eyup Stetkovac in Belgrade; date 
not given: "Europe Not Firm With Serbs and Croats"] 
  [Excerpt] Foreign minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Irfan 
Ljubljankic, has criticized the European Union's irresolute 
position toward his country's problem and expects the Parliament 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina to reject the partition of the capital, 
Sarajevo. He added, in an exclusive telephone interview with 
AL-HAYAH from his office in Sarajevo: 
  "We have warned the European Union that the signatures of 
the 
Serb and Croat parties cannot be relied upon unless they are 
accompanied by international resoluteness to force them into 
compliance and implementation. The Europeans, however, have not 
paid attention, which has led to the failure of the last truce 
and the continuation of obstacles to humanitarian aid convoys." 
  The Bosnian foreign minister discussed the question of 
Sarajevo, saying that the presidential commission still lacks a 
final position in this regard, pending the decision of the 
Parliament of Bosnia-Herzegovina. "It is certain, however, that 
its decision will reject any partition of the capital." 
  He mentioned the city of Mostar in the south of the country, 
whose population is 40 percent Muslim, 38 percent Croatian, and 
22 percent Serbian, explaining that the Croats had expressed 
their readiness to study its partition, under pressure from the 
European Union, "but so far they have not shown any goodwill." 
  He asserted that the Bosnian government still stood by its 
decision not to negotiate over an outlet to the sea at the 
Prevlaka peninsula, "because it is absolutely unacceptable to 
us." He pointed out that in the ongoing contacts with the Croats 
over the outlet, it had been decided that Bosnian Prime Minister 
Dr. Haris Silajdzic would meet with Croat Foreign Minister Mate 
Granic in Vienna on January 3 to discuss the question of Niyum, 
and reaching this port through Croatian territory. He said that 
when this problem is solved, the fate of the agreement will be 
deadlocked in the coming talks set for the 18th [of January] in 
Geneva. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prague (DDP/ADN) -- Russian oil deliveries to the 
Czech Republic and Slovakia have been interrupted since the 
beginning of the week. According to the Prague-based newspaper 
LIDOVE NOVINY today, production will halt at the refineries from 
tomorrow. 
  According to Vladimir Krasa [name as received], head of the 
Czech state company Benzina, the interruption is 
"administrative." For unknown reasons, the private Russian oil 
exporters have not received new export licenses from the 
responsible ministries. The Czech refineries in Litvinov, 
Kralupy, and Pardubice are currently working by using reserves 
belonging to the Slovak firm Transpetrol. These, however, will 
last four days at most. After this a crisis staff will have to 
decide whether oil from the state reserves is to be used or 
imported from other countries. 
  Krasa assumes that there will not be a crisis as the Russian 
side has so far always fulfilled its obligations. Regardless of 
this, both the government and the Chemapol company, which 
imports 90 percent of the Czech Republic's oil, are pressing for 
deliveries to be restarted. 
  The successors to the CSFR [Czechoslovak Federal Republic] 
normally receive 82,000 tonnes of oil a day through the 
"Druzhba" pipeline, of which each state receives around half. 
The situation at both countries' refineries has been difficult 
for around two months because of irregular supplies.

<F P=106> [Interview with Czech President Vaclav Havel by Eva Hulkova </F>
at Lany presidential residence; date not given: "Conversations 
at Lany" -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Hulkova] Mr. President, you have always rather 
vehemently opposed a concept of "Conversations" that would have 
us deal with the past week. But this week was marked by the 
visit of Bill Clinton, and we simply cannot ignore this fact. 
  [Havel] I think we cannot. I would like to make perhaps two 
or three minor observations in relation to this visit. As far 
as the substance is concerned, meaning the future European 
security arrangement, the political arrangement and the 
Partnership for Peace plan, I would not touch on it too much 
anymore. A lot was said about it. I would make only one 
observation. Voices are often heard that this is not enough, 
that it is only a form of pacifying us, calming us down, of 
delaying NATO membership and that the right thing would be to 
accept us immediately. I think these are quite short-sighted 
voices because few people are aware that all this places some 
demands on us. [passage omitted] For example, the Partnership 
for Peace plan means that our soldiers may have to go fight 
somewhere occasionally. It means that foreign troops could be 
here for certain joint exercises. It is difficult to know how 
the public will react to this. It will also cost some money. 
It will require making certain psychological, moral, and also 
material investments. It remains to be seen to what extent our 
society, our public is ready for it. It seems to me that it is 
a very well balanced plan, and we should not forget this side of 
it. On the degree of our capability to take over this common 
responsibility for Europe, that will primarily depend on how 
really and fully we are going to be able to be integrated in 
such structures as NATO. 
  [Hulkova] When I think of Bill Clinton, it seems to me that 
compared with other U.S. Presidents he is playing a special and 
important role. [passage omitted] What kind of man is he? What 
are his qualities as a statesman? How does he measure up as the 
U.S. President? After all, this is the most important 
political post in the world. 
  [Havel] [passage omitted] My impression was that he was an 
unusually responsible, sincere, direct, and open man. Although 
on television, especially during the election campaign, he may 
appear as a continually smiling television star aware of being 
surrounded by cameras, I have arrived at the conclusion that he 
is a sincere man. He is really like that. He is a very frank 
man who wants to know everything. [passage omitted] He is a 
very direct man who likes to meet people, and who likes to 
listen to them. [passage omitted] 
  All this makes me like him. At the same time it does not 
mean that he is not a professional. He always finds time to 
read books on politics, history, the future, and other books. 
In the White House he is surrounded by a large number of 
intellectuals and scientists. He is a man who likes to think 
and who is attempting to see matters in a long term perspective. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Hulkova] Let's recall another aspect of Bill Clinton's 
visit 
to our country. It has been apparent for some time that the 
Visegrad countries [Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, and 
Hungary] find themselves at a crossroads and that they do not 
know how to continue. Have all the negotiations that took place 
provided some kind of an indication of what should happen next? 
  [Havel] The cooperation between the four was surrounded by 
an 
endless number of various speculations, conjectures, and 
analyses that appeared both in our and foreign press. I think 
-- and I have said this on many occasions -- that we are in fact 
living in a different time now, that the original purpose of the 
group has been exhausted and fulfilled, as it were, and that the 
era of grand joint declarations, manifestos, and summits, by 
which we were demonstrating our indestructible unity, has 
passed. We had to do this at the time when we were jointly 
trying to extricate ourselves from Soviet hegemony. That's 
clear and it has been said on a number of occasions. 
  I think, however, that the other half of the truth should be 
voiced, too. The truth is that we will be living side by side 
with our neighbors for centuries to come, and this is more 
important than whether our opinions are closer to a particular 
government or to a particular president of a neighboring 
country. We must bear the long term perspective in mind. We 
must be aware of the fact that almost 60 percent of our exports 
are in fact exports to neighboring countries. [passage omitted] 
  What is at issue now is finding a new identity and a new 
form 
of this regional cooperation that will be in keeping with the 
present time. The fact is that at the present time, when the 
interests of individual countries are beginning to 
differentiate, when differences in the historical identity of 
these countries are coming to the surface, it is becoming clear 
that things are slightly different in this period than they were 
in the initial phase. Thus, cooperation will have to have a 
different form. It will have to be less manifest. It will have 
to be a specific cooperation in various spheres, in the spheres 
where a common minimum of joint interests exists, as our foreign 
minister puts it. I would like to add to this that we should 
hold talks even in the spheres where there is a divergence of 
interests or where our interests differ or where differences 
exist. We should conduct a lasting political dialogue. 
  Certain differences between individual countries, which are 
gradually beginning to emerge, are not a reason for terminating 
the dialogue. On the contrary, these differences should lead to 
stepping up the dialogue. 
  I became aware of this during a presidential dinner, when 
four presidents of the countries of this group had a very 
interesting, professional, and long debate. It was dominated by 
a discussion between President Walesa and President Goncz, whose 
views were quite different. I then realized how important this 
type of discussion is. [passage omitted] This contributes to the 
cleansing of regional climate, which is very important. 
  My impression is that this meeting, this joint meeting with 
President Clinton, contributed to our more intensive thinking 
about new forms, new shapes, and new identities of this regional 
cooperation in Central Europe. 
  Voices appeared reproaching the United States for forcing us 
too strongly into coordination or joint conduct and for not 
paying enough attention to the fact that we are independent 
states and that each of us is in a slightly different situation. 
Although they may well have a point, I would also like to point 
out that the United States has the experience of the 
1,000-year-long hostility between France and Germany. Thousands 
of disputes came to an end after World War II when West European 
integration started to form itself. It was the United States 
that to a considerable extent contributed to this integration 
under the Marshall Plan. [passage omitted] 
  To a certain extent perhaps, the United States applies or 
reflects this experience to Central Europe. I think that this 
aspect is also noteworthy. 
  [Hulkova] Mr. President, perhaps it could be said that your 
considerations are aimed at a meeting in Litomysl where you will 
meet representatives of not only the Visegrad countries but also 
representatives of Germany, Austria, and Slovenia. 
  [Havel] Reports about this meeting have already appeared in 
newspapers. It might be appropriate for me to comment further 
on this issue. Recently I, our prime minister, and our foreign 
minister agreed that we felt that Austria and Slovenia were also 
an integral part of Central Europe. [passage omitted] 
  Last year, when attending the opening of the Salzburg 
Festival, we had a meeting with President Goncz, [Austrian 
President Thomas] Klestil and President von Weizsaecker. The 
talks we had were very interesting. There was also a big 
television discussion. We agreed to meet from time to time and 
also to invite those who were absent; in other words the Slovak 
and Polish presidents. [passage omitted] 
  It was my idea that we could meet in Litomysl. It was in 
Salzburg that I invited them to visit the Czech Republic. All 
of them agreed. [passage omitted] 
  It would be an unofficial meeting. The purpose of this 
meeting would not be to conclude treaties and agreements and 
issue declarations. Nothing of the sort. Its purpose would be 
to contribute to a good regional climate and create a 
psychologically favorable atmosphere or scope that would make it 
possible for our executive bodies -- the governments -- to 
carry out their work. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Petr Bakovsky: "Baudys Described the Partnership </F>
for Peace Project as Clinton's Success"] 
  [Text] Prague -- The Partnership for Peace is a call and 
an offer for closer cooperation among those who will join it. 
It can create the conditions for establishing a safe zone in 
Europe, Defense Minister Baudys said. 
  "A number of critics say that the process is very slow. 
However, we have been unable to find anything better so far, 
something that would be accepted by all NATO members," Baudys 
said and continued: "I see the fact that all parties were able 
to reach a complete agreement as a significant success of 
Clinton's administration, and also his own personal success." 
  According to Baudys, it is also theoretically possible to 
look at the matter like thus: If NATO decided to admit several 
new members now, then all the Partnership For Peace processes 
would have to be started anyway. The only difference would be: 
We would have security guarantees from the very beginning. 
Baudys also believes that guarantees are not an issue at this 
time. "We can see no actual danger in Europe, for the time 
being." 
  Baudys explained what the Partnership For Peace program 
demands of the army. He said that we would have to find a 
certain number of very capable young officers to undergo foreign 
language training. "We would give them a six-month course of 
intensive language training, international law, and NATO 
organization. They should acquire the necessary knowledge of 
coordinating, planning, and organizing activities, so they can 
represent us in NATO institutions." 
  The preparation of joint exercises and actions is the second 
step. Baudys said that several military exercises were agreed 
with France outside the Partnership For Peace program. Joint 
exercises with smaller units from Holland have also been 
planned. Baudys said that in consultations with NATO countries, 
we were informed beforehand and had time to prepare ourselves. 
  Baudys described as the most important prerequisite for our 
joining NATO equipping our army with NATO-compatible 
communication and telecommunication systems. Replacement of the 
arsenal will continue in the years to come, but this is not the 
most important factor. 
  It is expected, according to the Partnership For Peace 
program, that individual countries will be able to provide some 
of their forces in case of need. According to Baudys, apart 
from other units, the fully professional Rapid Deployment 
Brigade could be used for this purpose. This brigade is in the 
process of being established and will be given priority when 
providing new equipment to army units. The brigade should have 
some 3,500 people. Baudys sees a problem in the selection of 
proper people for the brigade. This is why the Defense Ministry 
is preparing a publicity action to help acquire proper people. 
The ministry is examining all the possibilities of financing 
the brigade in such a way as to make service in they brigade 
attractive.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Antonin Baudys by Jan </F>
Stetka; place and date not given: "Perhaps We Will Welcome NATO 
Troops to the Czech Republic"] 
  [Text] We asked Defense Minister Antonin Baudys some 
questions in connection with the discussion on the Czech 
Republic's attitude toward the Visegrad Group countries. 
  [Stetka] Following President Clinton's visit to Prague, how 
do you view the possibilities for military cooperation among the 
Visegrad countries? 
  [Baudys] The Visegrad grouping is -- from our point of view 
-- obsolete. Bulgaria, Romania, and the Baltic states are 
applying for membership of NATO; perhaps even Slovenia will join 
them. These countries are asking justifiably, why Visegrad and 
not us? Close military cooperation among the Visegrad countries 
narrows down the issue unacceptably. Partnership for Peace is 
an individual plan, and, therefore, an absolutely correct one. 
On the other hand, the Czech Republic is the most active 
propagator of economic cooperation in Central Europe. In my 
opinion, associating entry into NATO with military cooperation 
among the Visegrad countries is nonsense. 
  [Stetka] What do you think of Poland's reservations about 
alleged Czech individualism? 
  [Baudys] I understand President Walesa, because his country 
borders directly on Belarus and the Kaliningrad Oblast, where 
there is a large concentration of Russian troops. The question 
is, of course, whether all the members of the Polish cabinet 
share Walesa's views. 
  [Stetka] Do you know anything specific yet about Czech 
participation in Partnership for Peace? 
  [Baudys] Naturally, we have an idea, because we were 
consulted on the project in advance. We are planning a 
six-month course for the military experts who will represent us 
in NATO headquarters. Last year, we planned joint exercises 
involving Czech units and a French company and now, within the 
framework of the Partnership, we are also planning exercises 
with the Dutch. They will be held this year. It is possible 
that they will be held in our country.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Roman </F>
Krasnicky in Prague; date not given: "The Regions' Jurisdiction 
Could Be Like an Explosive"] 
  [Text] [Krasnicky] Is the Czech Republic ready to take 
part in the Partnership for Peace plan and in regular military 
exercises with NATO states? 
  [Klaus] Partnership for Peace, as a global concept, does not 
say anything about the frequency of contacts between individual 
countries and NATO. This will be a matter for the next stage -- 
the conclusion of specific treaties between NATO and the 
individual countries that want to join the Partnership. Only 
then will the scope and intensity of this cooperation be 
specified. Undoubtedly, there will be major differences between 
countries. Undoubtedly, the Czech Republic's interests will be 
different than those of Kazakhstan. Therefore, let us not jump 
the gun. Nevertheless, it is evident that the financial aspect 
will play a role here. Of course, to assume that this will lead 
to an increase in our expenditure on defense is unrealistic. 
  [Krasnicky] Have you seen the actual text of Partnership for 
Peace? 
  [Klaus] I have seen it in the form of a xeroxed fax, but I 
think that, at the moment, there is no need to hurry. The 
Foreign Ministry will submit the appropriate material to the 
government at the appropriate time and will also draft a 
response to the North Atlantic Alliance. 
  [Krasnicky] There has been talk recently about citizenship 
for the Volhynian Czechs and Czechs from Kazakhstan have shown 
an interest in returning to the republic. What is the reason 
behind the government's caution in dealing with these issues? 
  [Klaus] The main reason for the caution was -- and, to a 
certain extent, still is -- our attempt not to complicate the 
internal situation in the Czech Republic by unexpected and 
excessive migration. This was a topical issue mainly during the 
breakup of Czechoslovakia. At that time, we required 
unambiguous and precise conditions so that, in the individual 
human sphere, we could clearly determine who was a citizen of 
the Czech Republic and who was a citizen of Slovakia. On the 
other hand, a few individuals -- whether Volhynian Czechs or 
anyone else -- are really extreme cases that do not cause any 
major problems in our country. The principal caution was not 
directed against them. 
  [Krasnicky] The government will draw up a concept for the 
jurisdiction of the future regions or lands before the end of 
January. Why do you think the law on this jurisdiction has to 
be a constitutional law? In the opinion of some experts, 
jurisdiction should be a variable and not something preserved by 
a constitutional law.... 
  [Klaus] Jurisdiction is a terribly important issue and -- as 
we saw once within the framework of the Czechoslovak state -- 
was the explosive that constantly destabilized relations between 
the partners. We do not want anything like this to happen in 
the united and unitary Czech Republic; we do not want to 
introduce any federalistic and autonomistic elements into it. 
On the contrary, I would again say that a constitutional law is 
not necessary to change the border, for example, between south 
Bohemia and central Bohemia because of a single zigzagging 
stream whose flow has changed.

  [Text] Prague -- Partnership for Peace will not contribute 
to cooperation, but, on the contrary, to rivalry. This 
statement was made by Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia 
[KSCM] Chairman M. Grebenicek at a news conference. He 
expressed his dissatisfaction with the Czech Government's 
immediate agreement to this proposal without a public debate and 
called for a referendum. According to Deputy Chairman M. 
Ransdorf, the Partnership will make considerable claims on the 
Czech Republic's budget. He emphasized the likelihood of a 
"certain yielding of part of our state sovereignty" without 
clear security guarantees. According to the KSCM, collective 
security should be based on the CSCE. 
  M. Stiborova, chairwoman of the Left Bloc Party, said that 
Partnership for Peace will not resolve our entry into NATO. In 
her opinion, not even the expansion of NATO is a path toward 
collective European security. According to Stiborova, the CSCE 
should form the basis for European security.

  [Text] [Announcer] The 1993 state budget has recorded a 
surplus exceeding one billion crowns. Marie Ruzickova is in the 
studio with the details. 
  [Ruzickova] The finance minister [Ivan Kocarnik] said that 
total revenue, which amounted to 358 billion crowns, meant that 
the budget's revenue of has been fulfilled by 100.8 percent. 
Expenditure, amounting to almost 357 billion crowns, was 
fulfilled by 100.5 percent. 
  The Czech Republic is the only country, of those that are 
undergoing the process of transformation, that recorded a budget 
surplus. Minister Kocarnik thinks this result is a success. 
  [Begin Kocarnik recording] I regard this result as a 
success, 
as a further successful step of transformation in the Czech 
Republic, which has brought a positive contribution to the 
overall stabilization of prices, countered inflation, and 
contributed to achieving the basic objectives we set out for 
ourselves for the year 1993 [end recording]. 
  [Ruzickova] The budget surplus could have been higher by 
another 4.6 billion crowns. This sum is the credit we gave to 
Slovakia in clearing transactions. According to Minister 
Kocarnik, both sides are considering changes in the 
[Czech-Slovak] Payments Agreement. These changes would mean a 
gradual abolition of the so called "old bloc" [stary blok] and a 
possible widening of the exchange rate margin from 5 to 10 
percent. No increase of marginal credit [mezni uver] is 
envisaged for the time being. 
  On talks of the Czech-Slovak property commission, Ivan 
Kocarnik said that this commission should meet in a foreseeable 
future and outline the final solution to outstanding problems.

<F P=106> ["(jem)"-signed report: "The Reduction in Army Personnel </F>
Will Probably Be Halted Next Year"] 
  [Text] Prague -- The reduction in army personnel will be 
halted in 1995 at 65,000 men. This corresponds to the treaty on 
reducing conventional armed forces in Europe. A more 
substantial reduction had originally been envisaged. The army's 
significance, however, will increase appreciably, among other 
things, because of the continuing conflicts in the former 
Yugoslavia and in the southern regions of the former Soviet 
Union, said Oldrich Holecek of the Defense Ministry's Press 
Department. At the moment, the planned number of Czech Army 
personnel is 92,599. The actual number is somewhat lower. 
Roughly a third of the army is made up of career soldiers. In 
two years, however, professionals should make up 50 percent of 
the army, while soldiers on their basic service should make up 
the other 50 percent.

<F P=106> [Statements by Ion Ratiu, vice president of the National </F>
Peasant Christian Democratic Party, Petre Roman, president of 
the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front), and Niculae 
Spiroiu, minister of national defense, to journalists Christiana 
Terenche and Clementina Filip on NATO's Partnership for Peace 
offer; place and date not given: "Reactions to Partnership for 
Peace"] 
  [Text] 
<H3>  Ion Ratiu, President of the Foreign Policy 
Commission of the Chamber of Deputies: "The Responsibility Is 
Ours" </H3>
  This is the best solution we could have hoped for, since the 
alternative would have been to have the Visegrad countries 
immediately accepted under the NATO umbrella. In such a 
situation, we would have been left outside the Western defense 
system and would have inevitably had to gravitate toward the 
CIS. Although it is not perfect from our viewpoint, since it 
does not offer us firm guarantees, the "Partnership for Peace" 
project gives us the opportunity to gradually move toward 
fulfilling the minimum requirements for our integration in the 
alliance. At the same time, the "Partnership for Peace" means 
that no discrimination is being made between the former 
communist countries in Eastern Europe. Romania has announced in 
advance its intention of accepting the "Partnership for Peace" 
formula. The only question mark remains whether NATO might not 
subjectively decide, in the forthcoming future, that the 
Visegrad countries are capable of qualifying, while we are not. 
Therefore, it is up to us to prove that we are a positive asset 
for the alliance in this part of Europe. Romania has now the 
possibility of proving that it deserves to be included in NATO. 
The responsibility is ours, hence our task is to prove that we 
can qualify for integration in the alliance. 
<H3>  Petre Roman, NATO rapporteur for Eastern Europe: "The Time 
Factor Plays an Essential Role" </H3>
  The "Partnership for Peace" is a compromise between two 
obvious trends and situations currently prevailing in Europe. 
On the one hand, the very pressing request of the former 
communist countries, including Romania, to accede to the status 
of NATO member and, on the other hand, Russia's categorical 
rejection of an eventual expansion of NATO. The argument of the 
former communist countries -- an argument which I also sustained 
before various international forums -- is that Russia remains an 
exceptionally great power, with a very strong military machine 
and a pretty vague new military doctrine, while the old strategy 
linked to the Soviet imperialist spirit is still prevalent. 
Russia claims that the entire process of democratization and 
reform is going to be endangered by NATO's expansion, which 
would be tantamount to an expansion of the bloc policy, 
something that prevailed during the Cold War period. What is 
certain is that we are left with the feeling of a possible 
revival of Russian imperialism, for reasons that are well-known 
in our history. Therefore, I believe that the target of our 
integration in NATO -- until we become full-fledged members -- 
is the main task of the Romanian foreign policy. On the other 
hand, the solution with the "Partnership for Peace" only offers 
some thinking time off to everybody. The United States cannot 
accept the viewpoint of the Russian imperialism and is obliged 
to make all efforts to dissociate itself from such a trend. It 
is obvious that the time factor plays an essential role. The 
revival of imperialist trends would mean a lot of sorrow and 
material sacrifice for the Russian people. The "Partnership for 
Peace" also emphasizes another trend, that of concrete U.S. 
disengagement from Europe. The United States has major 
problems, economic and particularly social. The same applies to 
Western Europe. The problem is the following: In this 
precarious economic context, on what terms can security be 
ensured? One cannot forget that NATO is not only a political 
body, but mainly a military one. Therefore, ensuring a balance 
also presupposes deterrence, particularly deterrence of the 
Russian imperialist tendencies. Consequently, the functioning 
of the "Partnership for Peace" scheme implies the achievement of 
its declared goal. In practical terms, it means deterring any 
influences and tactics through which Russia may attempt to pull 
the ropes in Europe, particularly in Eastern Europe. 
<H3>  Lieutenant General Niculae Spiroiu, Minister of National 
Defense: "The Romanian Military Is Capable of Integrating in 
NATO" </H3>
  In my opinion, the "Partnership for Peace" is a much better 
solution than the discriminatory admittance of East and Central 
European states to NATO, provided that it is a provisional step 
and permits access to the European defense structures. From our 
viewpoint, that is from the viewpoint of the Romanian military 
body, I believe that it is capable of integration in the 
military structures of the alliance's member states, thanks to 
the reform measures it has adopted thus far.

<F P=106> [Report by Predrag Sarac from the Kordun-Banija region] </F>
  [Excerpt] Judging by everything that has been offered so 
far at the numerous campaign rallies, the Krajina citizens are 
facing a crucial decision because they must decide between two 
diametrically opposed plans: Milan Martic's, based on the 
commitment to a Krajina integrated into a single Serbian state, 
and Milan Babic's, whose program threatens to isolate the 
republic of Serbian Krajina. 
  This was particularly evident at promotional rallies of 
presidential candidate Milan Martic, also attended by members of 
the executive headquarters [not further specified], in the 
Kordun-Banija towns and villages. Talks with academician 
Mihajlo Markovic [Socialist Party of Serbia deputy in Serbia], 
who answered the Krajina citizens direct questions, elicited 
particular attention and approval. 
  [Begin Markovic recording] I think it is really disgraceful 
that anyone living in the Krajina today can think and publicly 
claim that there is a chance of Serbia betraying or selling out 
the Krajina. I think that this absolutely out of the question; 
after all, Serbia and the Serbian people have been exposed to 
sanctions and threats of military intervention, and various 
other modes of punishment, but they never for a moment relented, 
nor will they ever relent in defense of all Serbian people. 
[end recording] 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Minister, as presidential 
candidate, can you tell us something about the fate of the pink 
zones [UN Protected Areas], and, if you win, how you plan to 
resolve the issue of the pink zones? 
  [Begin Martic recording] Not one of the leaderships so far 
has ever accepted the pink zones. If you followed the news, you 
know that we always rejected them. I have reiterated at least 
100 times that I would not recognize the pink zones. I 
recognize the Serbian ethnic area and all that is ours, all that 
we hold, will be ours, they can call it whatever they like. At 
one of the assembly's sessions in Vukovar, I demanded -- I do 
not know if anyone of you here was part of the parliament at the 
time -- that we abolish the pink zones, that the assembly reject 
them. I was prevented from doing so by Milan Babic's 
parliamentarians. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Drazen Vukov-Colic: "Clinton Is Not Defending </F>
Sarajevo"] 
  [Text] The best-kept U.S. secret is: During the first 
year of his election, Bill Clinton has proved to be a very, very 
successful president. At least to the United States, to which 
he promised everything, and has done a lot. His tax reforms, 
his agreement on free trade between Canada, the United States, 
and Mexico, his liberalization of abortion, his battle against 
unobstructed accumulation of private weapons, and his elaborate 
budget deficit cutdown have lead to the first real economic 
take-offs: In only 10 months, the private entrepreneurs have 
employed more people than in the past four years. His strength 
-- and not weakness -- is proven by the fact that, in the battle 
for new budgetary discipline, he won in Congress by only one 
vote that is needed to have the prescribed majority, while the 
unbiased experts have a lot of reason to claim that no 
president, since Lyndon Johnson left in 1969, has made the 
proverbially cautious American Congress so busy. However, the 
man who was, in the election battle, called "the great 
communicator", after Reagan, knows that both the U.S. and the 
international public judge him to be as a frightened 
compromiser, indecisive leader, and a very superficial expert. 
In an open interview for the famous ROLLING STONE Clinton 
himself admitted that he had turned from a favorite of the media 
into a subject of media ridicule. "I have done a lot," said he, 
"but, with all my attempts to change the American lifestyle, I 
have not received a single media award." 
  The world thus survives in the shadow of the "Clinton 
paradox": an efficient president, but an unconvincing leader, a 
model of diligence, but almost provincially lonely. What is 
good for the United States is not good for the world, and it 
should be, at a time when it remains the only world superpower. 
The first reactions to the first Clinton "European speech" also 
fit into the above frame: The appearance was skillfully 
prepared, but there was nothing in it that will be remembered 
for very long. Regardless of the fact that Clinton also dared 
to bomb Iraq, seriously threatened North Korea, took a firm 
stand against the Japanese challenge, placed everything on the 
Yeltsin card, speeded up the Middle Eastern and South African 
peace talks, united the entire American continent, and bridged 
the Pacific again, Clinton's great European tour has been 
experienced only as a late routine. In Brussels he tried to 
save NATO by the inadequate formula `Partnership for Peace', in 
Prague he will try to restore trust in real U.S. support to the 
newly-established eastern democracies, in Moscow he will 
encourage Yeltsin -- and perhaps scorn him a little -- but this 
extensive itinerary does not promise key answers to three 
important questions: Who will the United States strategically 
protect and how, will it join the general efforts to curb the 
unimaginable Balkan war and how, how will it prevent the general 
decay of the most talked of Western principles with this sway of 
anachronic and anarchic nationalisms, and can it do that? 
  Naturally: Under U.S. leadership, NATO will not run with 
their arms open to meet the new eastern European regimes that 
could, under the same strategic umbrella, get it into dangerous 
territorial or ethnic alignments. The remaining 14 members have 
already had enough of Greece and Turkey because of Cyprus, and 
what is again smoldering between Russia and Poland, Slovakia and 
Hungary, the Baltics and Moscow. This is why it should not be 
expected that the NATO summit will result in any specific 
decisions on the Balkan wars. It is generally claimed that air 
strike threats will be renewed, "because of the strangling of 
Sarajevo", but cynics claim that NATO will move only when the 
victim is dead. Karadzic has "ordered a unilateral ceasefire" 
in the battles for Sarajevo, in order to prevent this 
"indicative stutter". Zagreb has yet to digest the manifest 
admonition of Madeleine Albright, one of whose reasons for 
coming was obviously to calm down the overloquacious U.S. 
ambassador. Tudjman also knows that only in its most fantastic 
dreams could there be chances of "NATO applying force" if 
Izetbegovic does not agree to his most generous offers. At the 
moment it was still unknown whether the Bonn talks might change 
anything, the only reliable thing was the bitter message that 
Clinton is unequaled only at home.

  [Excerpts] The extraordinary meeting of the central council 
of the Slovak National Party [SNS] is taking place in Bratislava 
today. Our collaborator, Renata Havranova, an editor of the 
daily PRACE has telephoned us the following report. 
  [Begin Havranova recording] [passage omitted] Immediately 
after the meeting opened, Igor Uhrik resigned his post as SNS 
deputy chairman. In a written statement on his resignation, he 
said that he was driven to taking that step by the group's dirty 
methods, which centered around Deputy Prime Ministers Prokes and 
Andel. 
  According to Uhrik, apart from lies and punching below the 
belt, a certain group was not shrinking away from drawing a 
picture of bloody conflicts in southern Slovakia only in order 
to depose the party's leader, Ludovit Cernak. In his statement 
he has rejected the destructive policy of Vladimir Meciar. I do 
not mean to put a mark of legitimacy on this meeting by my 
presence when it is apparent that corruption is one of the main 
factors, Uhrik told Czech radio. 
  The fact is that SLOVENSKY DENNIK today published under the 
heading: The price of Cernak's head, names of SNS members who 
have received letters of appointment to lucrative posts in the 
state administration and other posts. The first name on the 
list is Vitazoslav Moric, who, in his own words, has the post of 
head of Armex holding company, which exports arms abroad, in his 
pocket. As a reward for removing Cernak, the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia has offered Jozef Prokes the post of 
minister for foreign affairs and to Marian Andel the post of 
deputy speaker of the Slovak Parliament, currently held by 
Ludovit Cernak. In play are state secretaries [deputy 
ministers] posts, the head of the Office for Labor Safety, and 
chairman of a parliamentary committee, as well as promises made 
by the ruling movement to where and to whom the post of head of 
the State Inspection Office will not go. 
  Those whose names have been listed in the daily ignore with 
a 
smile questions about the truthfulness of the published article. 
No one has, however, denied the report. Cernak said in an 
informal conversation that the SNS congress will certainly be 
convened, apparently in February. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report in the "From Yesterday's Briefings" </F>
column: "Christian Democratic Movement: Nagorno Karabakh in 
Slovakia?"] 
  [Text] According to Frantisek Miklosko, deputy chairman of 
the Christian Democratic Movement, the course of the Hungarian 
ethnic minority's rally in Komarno [on 8 January] was controlled 
by the Coexistence Movement. He also said that the Hungarian 
language enclave to the south of Nitra was reminiscent of 
Nagorno Karabakh. Whereas in 1990 7 percent of Hungarians in 
southern Slovakia advocated political autonomy, in September 
1993 this had increased to 45 percent, and the latest polls 
indicate that this percentage is growing. "If the Government of 
the Slovak Republic acts without a concept in its ethnic policy, 
without talks, and irrationally, a political ghetto and a 
scarcely controllable situation will arise in southern Slovakia, 
which will ultimately evolve into an irredentist movement. The 
borders of this irredentist movement were mapped out in Komarno 
on 8 January," Frantisek Miklosko declared.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vojtech Bugar, chairman of the Hungarian </F>
Christian Democratic Movement, by Jan Zizka in Komarno on 8 
January: "We Do Not Want To Secede From Slovakia"] 
  [Text] Komarno -- In the course of Saturday's [8 January] 
assembly of elected representatives of the Hungarian minority in 
Slovakia, held in Komarno, Vojtech Bugar, chairman of the 
Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH], granted an 
interview to HOSPODARSKE NOVINY. The MKDH is the coalition 
partner of the Egyutteles [Coexistence] Movement; both movements 
jointly represent the Hungarian minority in the Slovak 
Parliament. 
  [Zizka] Do you think that today's assembly might exacerbate 
relations between Hungarians and Slovaks? 
  [Bugar] For a whole month, someone has been persuading 
Slovak citizens that what we are doing is anti-constitutional 
and that we are about to proclaim territorial autonomy. 
Naturally, this is not true. How can an assembly of citizens, 
irrespective of their nationality, exacerbate the situation? We 
are not adopting any memorandum "against someone" but "for 
something." The situation, in my opinion, will not come to a 
head. 
  [Zizka] What was your movement's share in this undertaking? 
  [Bugar] The organizer is the Association of Zitny Ostrov 
[Rye Island, Hungarian-inhabited area in southern Slovakia] 
Towns and Villages. The MKDH and Egyutteles are actually only 
"allies." We joined the initiators and tried to help them 
organizationally. The assembly has been addressed by mayors and 
representatives of self-administration bodies, not by political 
parties. 
  [Zizka] The view exists that, outwardly, you dissociate 
yourselves from this undertaking somewhat, while in reality you 
are the spiritual fathers of this assembly. 
  [Bugar] We definitely do not dissociate ourselves from it; 
we only point out that this is not a rally of political parties. 
  [Zizka] Is the idea of territorial self-administration 
realistic at this time, in your opinion? 
  [Bugar] The terms territorial autonomy or province are not 
even mentioned in the statements adopted by this assembly. 
Quite the contrary, it is repeatedly stated in them that all 
problems must be addressed within the framework of the territory 
of the Slovak Republic. The new territorial arrangement should 
result in exactly the same powers [for local self-administration 
bodies] in the south of Slovakia as in purely Slovak regions. 
However, the citizens of Hungarian nationality should not be 
dissipated [rozdrobeni] as provided for by the government's 
current project. I think that in pointing this out, we are only 
making use of our constitutional right. 
  [Zizka] So how do explain that in the assessment of your 
steps, the view also keeps cropping up that you are demanding an 
independent province? 
  [Bugar] A mistake occurred in that in the first appeal 
issued by the organizers of the assembly, the word "tartomany" 
was used, which can also be translated as province. (Tartomany 
can be translated as province or area -- editor's note.) We 
often explained this, but the explanation never appeared in the 
newspapers. To this day, Slovak constitutional officials have 
not accepted that the organizers are not after a province or 
territorial autonomy, let alone secession from Slovakia.

  [Excerpt] Slovak Prime Minister Meciar has made some harsh 
and not overly diplomatic statements about the demands and 
rights of the Hungarian minority. Incidentally, with this he 
has also set himself against the more moderate stance of the 
Slovak head of state. Ildiko Nagy reports from Bratislava: 
  [Nagy] Certain political forces exceed the limits of 
tolerance when they demand collective rights for the Hungarians 
of Slovakia. If in this way they want to increase tension, they 
must reckon with the fact that they are confronting the power of 
the state. There will not be any kind of province; we will 
guarantee that. And this country will not voluntarily give up 
as much as an inch of its territory, because that would lead to 
a Central European conflict. 
  These remarks were made by Vladimir Meciar at a discussion 
he 
held with workers of the Slovak Defense Ministry. 
  In connection with bilingual placename signs he stated: The 
government's wish is for the use of the Slovak name, translated 
into the language of the minority, and it does not agree with 
the proposal coming from the Castle [Slovak Presidency], which 
recommends that the minorities should use any name that suits 
them. 
  Minority rights are above average in Slovakia, stated the 
Slovak prime minister, according to whom Bill Clinton also 
rejected collective rights at the conversation he held with him 
in Prague. For this reason Vladimir Meciar trusts that the part 
dealing with the inviolability of borders will also be included 
in the Slovak-Hungarian interstate treaty, which is under 
preparation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Council of Europe experts today ended two-day talks 
with representatives of the Slovak Government on a 
government-sponsored bill on the territorial administrative 
division of Slovakia. Renata Havranova, editor of PRACE daily, 
reports from Bratislava: 
  [Havranova] (Mario Martins), head of the delegation of 
Council of Europe experts, noted that since his first visit last 
April, considerable progress on the part of the Slovak bodies 
has been noted in tackling territorial administrative division. 
Council of Europe experts are of the opinion that the proposed 
integration of state administration on a horizontal level could 
improve not only its efficiency, but also the coordination of 
branch activities and, above all, relations among citizens. 
Slovakia should speed up the process of decentralization so 
that appropriate laws can be put into practice prior to local 
elections. Experts consider as too liberal the principle of 
voluntarism in the cooperation of self-administration bodies 
when setting up offices. The Slovak Republic should safeguard 
the standard level of state administration by laws. 
  The experts pointed out that the problem of national 
minorities cannnot be solved by artificial division of the state 
into regions. They consider the geographical spread of 
minorities as one of the many factors of the reform. 
Representatives of the Council of Europe recommended permanent 
dialogue, above all, with the Hungarian minority. The problems 
of this minority, in their view, could become a question of 
human rights.

  [Text] Belgrade, Jan. 18 (TANJUG) -- In expectation of the 
government's programme for the economic recovery of Yugoslavia, 
scheduled to take effect on Monday, chaos is reigning in the 
commodity and money markets. 
  Most transactions are not carried out in the national 
currency, the dinar. Even farmers in the markets sell their 
goods solely for DM [German marks], the exchange rate of which 
changes several times a day. The value of the German currency 
has gone up exactly a thousand times since new year. Experts 
estimate that the January inflation rate in the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia is going to exceed the record one million per cent 
reached in December. 
  Turnover of goods in shops is rapidly dropping which is 
partly explained by a dramatic and massive impoverishment of the 
population, living under international economic sanctions for 
twenty months. 
  Most shops in central Belgrade are closed, each having the 
same notice "inventory" on the door. Salesmen do not want to 
sell their goods for dinars, which is being devaluated daily for 
several tenths percent, even less for cheques, because it is 
difficult to cash them in. Salesmen complain that it is harder 
and harder to purchase goods since the production in the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia is almost non-existent for lack of fuel, 
raw materials and primary products whose is banned by sanctions 
[sentence as received]. 
  Pensioners represent the mostly affected social category, 
but 
the standard of living of those who are employed is hardly any 
better. A large number of companies in Serbia paid out on 
Friday guaranteed weekly salary, amounting to an average 
5,000,000 dinars, which is less than 1 DM according to the 
current exchange rate. The physical survival of the population 
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia depends on crushing the 
inflationary chaos. The government has announced that the 
monetary reconstruction programme is planned to take effect at 
the beginning of next week. 
  According to experts, the fact that the new measures will be 
carried out without any support or assistance from international 
financial institutions represents a serious handicap.

  [Excerpt] Belgrade, 18 Jan (TANJUG) -- Blue Helmet members 
of the Nordic Battalion, who have stayed in Pancevo's Stevica 
Jovanovic barracks for several months, departed this morning 
together with 11 Leopard tanks from the territory of the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia, TANJUG has learned from the Federal 
Government Committee for Cooperation with the UN Peace Force. 
  The members of UNPROFOR [UN Peacekeeping Forces] from 
Sweden, 
Denmark and Norway were deployed in the Tuzla area. One part of 
this unit spent several months in the Pancevo barracks, waiting 
for permission from the authorities of the republic of Srpska to 
transport the 11 peace force tanks to Tuzla. 
  The republic of Srpska, however, regarded this intention as 
an attempt at irregularly applying the existing Blue Helmets 
mandate. 
  Representatives of the republic of Srpska army pointed out 
that UNPROFOR was tasked with keeping peace and providing 
humanitarian aid to civilian population, in the course of which 
they were authorized to carry personal and defensive weapons. A 
tank of the Leopard kind is neither a personal nor a defensive 
weapon. 
  Since no agreement on the passage of the tanks was reached, 
the Nordic soldiers have left Pancevo. In addition to the tanks 
and soldiers, 23 armored personnel carriers have also left 
Stevica Jovanovic barracks aboard three trains, the federal 
government committee says. [passage omitted]

Reporters were addressed by Vuk Draskovic, president of the 
Serbian Renewal Movement [SPO]; Dusan Mihajlovic, president of 
New Democracy; and Vesna Pesic, president of the Citizens' 
Alliance. Dragoljub Stankic has the details. 
  SPO President Vuk Draskovic immediately stressed Depos's 
position that there was no civil, state, or national interest 
more important than preventing poverty, hunger, mega-inflation, 
and the criminal hoarding of wealth. 
  [Begin Draskovic recording] Therefore, any program that 
secures the realization of these goals, in the government, the 
assembly, and in the public, will have Depos's full support. 
[end recording] 
  However, Draskovic later stressed that not every program 
could count on such support, particularly not the Federal 
Government's and Professor Dragoslav Avramovic's latest program. 
According to Draskovic, a good program requires certain 
prerequisites: lifting of the sanctions, an end to the war, the 
deblocking of assets abroad, and international financial support. 
  Dusan Mihajlovic, president of New Democracy, stressed that 
Depos would not support a Socialist government, nor would it be 
a part of it. He expects the opposition to be given the post of 
assembly chairman.

<F P=106> [Report by B. Burnazovski: "Serbian Priests Expelled From </F>
Macedonia"] 
  [Text] Kumanovo, 17 January -- The Democratic Party of 
Serbs and the Association of Serbs and Montenegrins in Macedonia 
are persistently calling upon the Serbian Orthodox Church [SOC] 
to send Serbian priests to Macedonia for religious ceremonies in 
villages inhabited by Serbs and in Macedonian Orthodox churches. 
They are doing this illegally and persistently for almost any 
important religious holiday, or when there is a festival in 
which God's blessing is needed. Thus, recently, at the New 
Year, there were two priests of the SOC in the Kumanovo villages 
of Umin Dol, Novo Selo, Staro Nagoricane, Cetirce, Dolno 
Konjare, Matejce, and Tromegja. They were Nenad Tasic, a SOC 
priest from Bosilegrad and a FRY citizen, and Srecko Cvetkovic, 
a priest from Suva Reka, who was also a FRY citizen staying 
temporarily in Tetovo. 
  After their activities had been discovered, both were taken 
before the district magistrate, who pronounced the appropriate 
sentences. Tasic, for promoting national and religious hatred 
and intolerance among the citizens of miscellaneous 
nationalities, was expelled from Macedonia. Cvetkovic, for 
abusing his profession and for being an illegal alien, was 
banned from any activities in Macedonia for a year. Moreover, 
they both had to pay fines of 1,156 denars. 
  It was not the first time that Tasic had been to Macedonia, 
because "at the request of the Serbian people and believers of 
the Serbian Orthodox Church" he had been in these Kumanovo 
villages in December "to serve his people with the religious 
ceremonies for St. Nicholas's Day and Christmas," as was noted 
in a public information release by the "Regional Church Board of 
the SOC in Kumanovo." He was also expelled from Macedonia for 
being there illegally. Before that, last October, the Vranje 
Bishop Pahomie was refused entry at the Macedonian-Serbian 
border, after he had wanted to attend the celebrations of the 
Battle of Kumanovo of 1913 without the knowledge of the 
Macedonian Orthodox Church. 
  However, there have been a number of indications that not 
only the religious rights of the Serbs in Macedonia are 
involved. The release in which the believers reacted to the 
first expulsion of Tasic was signed by the Regional Board of the 
SOC in Kumanovo, which shows that it [the board] had been 
established, and it was signed by Nenad Domovic, president of 
the Regional Board of the Democratic Party of the Serbs in the 
region of Kumanovo and Pcinja, with the seal of the Local Board 
of the Association of Serbs and Montenegrins in Macedonia. The 
next release, a reaction to the sentences to the two priests, 
was not given to the Macedonian mass media, but only in 
Belgrade. Therefore, the conclusion is that those who are 
reacting prefer their voices to be heard in Serbia, so that they 
can show the alleged danger in which Serbs are living in 
Macedonia.

  [Excerpt] Geneva, 18 Jan (TANJUG) -- This year's first 
round of peace negotiations began in Geneva's Palace of Nations 
shortly before 1300 today. Lord Owen and [Thorvald] Stoltenberg 
invited the presidents of Serbia, Montenegro, and Croatia as 
well as the leaders of the three warring parties in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to find ways of communicating and eventually 
to sign a peace agreement. 
  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic said on arrival at 
Geneva Airport that "the Serbian side has fulfilled its share of 
obligations" and that "now it is the Muslim side and the 
international community which should fulfill their share of 
obligations regarding the adoption of a peace plan and an end to 
sanctions." 
  Republic of Srpska president Radovan Karadzic expressed the 
following hopes: "The EC should make its move and fulfill what 
it should fulfill -- this means lifting the sanctions." 
  Montenegrin President Momir Bulatovic stressed: "In all our 
work so far and all our results, as well as in the commitments 
expressed by the Assembly of the Serbian republic yesterday, we 
have repeatedly displayed our commitment to finalizing the peace 
process. This requires agreement on the part of the Muslims and 
the Croatian side. I hope that the Muslim side will stop 
obstructing and I believe that the international community will 
bring pressure to bear on the Muslim side, if not today then in 
the near future. This is the sole matter to be addressed to 
have a peace agreement signed." 
  According to Bulatovic, head of the Montenegrin state, the 
lifting of sanctions has been included in the mainframe of a 
general agreement. He also said that the situation in the 
country precludes it from staking everything on the 
international community's words and trustworthiness. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Ma.S.: "Looking for Resources for the </F>
'Partnership'"] 
  [Text] The Council of Ministers has proposed an amendment 
to the deputies' bill on amending the Small Constitution. In 
line with this version, the government would present the "Report 
on the Condition of the State" on 30 June and not toward the end 
of March. The ministers decided that in the first quarter of the 
year the tax-free wage increase would be 1.5 percent. The 
Ministry of National Defense [MON] and the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs have set up a working group which is tasked with 
analyzing the "Partnership for Peace" initiative. 
  No decisions have been made with regard to this issue. At 
the government session on Tuesday [18 January], members 
discussed the results of the summit meeting in Prague. In the 
near future, deputy ministers of national defense and foreign 
affairs are supposed to "prepare conclusions for decisions" 
concerning the "Partnership for Peace." Council of Ministers 
Secretary Maciej Graniecki estimated that this would take from 
three to four weeks. 
  In a radio interview, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak 
explained that the "Partnership" formula would be fixed by the 
partners during negotiations. Thus, the government cannot 
decide to participate in the program; it can merely decide 
whether to take part in work on it. 
  Just before the session, head of MON Piotr Kolodziejczyk 
told journalists that our Army needs 500 billion zlotys to 
participate in the "Partnership." "Poland can afford it." 
However, in line with information we obtained, the prime 
minister does not want the expenditures on the program to be an 
additional burden on this year's budget. This would mean that 
the amount of money that has been earmarked for these ministries 
in this year's budget bill would have to be smaller, or that the 
additional money would have to be found "outside" (in various 
funds, for instance). 
  Ministers suggest that the "Report on the Condition of the 
State," which they are obliged to draw up by the bill on 
amending the Constitution, be presented by the government toward 
the end of June and not on 31 March. Discussion on the "report" 
would then coincide with debate on the vote of acceptance of 
accounts for the previous year. It will be easier to prepare 
the "report" at that time because the Central Office of 
Statistics will have submitted all its data by that time. 
  In line with the Tuesday resolution of the Pawlak Cabinet, 
the prime minister's Legislative Council is supposed to comprise 
fewer members: 35 instead of 60. The resolution also envisions 
departing from permanent working groups of the council. They 
are supposed to be replaced by ad hoc groups of experts. The 
council's members will receive fixed amounts of money. So far 
they have not been receiving any remuneration. 
  If the Sejm accepts the government's proposal, the National 
Atomic Energy Agency will be financed directly from the state 
budget. So far it has been receiving money exclusively from the 
coffers of the Atomic Energy Research Committee. 
  For the last time, the government set a monthly index of 
wage 
increase that is tax-free. In line with the decision of the 
Sejm, after the first quarter the popiwek [tax on excessive wage 
increases] will be abolished.

  [Text] Radovan Karadzic, president of the republic of 
Srpska, has disclosed the new platform for negotiations with the 
Croatian and Muslim sides in Geneva, which withdraws the 
concessions given to Muslims earlier because they have rejected 
the proposal offered for solving the crisis. In the 
continuation of the peace process the republic of Srpska will 
maintain the following positions, which take into consideration 
the actual situation. 
  The republic of Srpska is a sovereign and independent state 
established on the basis of the universal right of a people to 
self-determination. It will retain the right to association and 
unification. The capital of the republic of Srpska is Serbian 
Sarajevo. The borders of the republic of Srpska correspond to 
the actual situation, which includes access to the sea, to which 
the republic of Srpska has a right on the basis of the Serbian 
Declaration of the St. Germaine Peace Treaty and other 
international documents. In the interest of compressing 
territory, the borders with the Muslims can be adjusted on the 
basis of a political agreement, which would take into account 
communications and other needs. The borders with the Croats 
will be defined within the framework of a solution for the 
entire Serbian-Croatian conflict. The republic of Srpska will 
participate in the peace process, but it will insist on equal 
treatment which means that the sanctions have to be lifted and 
the threats against the Serbs have to stop. Any violation of 
the republic of Srpska's integrity will be taken as an act of 
aggression and [the Serbian republic] will respond according to 
regulations of international war law. 
  These are excerpts from the platform adopted at yesterday's 
session of the republic of Srpska assembly in Bijeljina.

  [Excerpts] Geneva, Jan 18 (AFP) -- A senior UN 
representative has recommended against using allied warplanes in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as proposed by NATO to relieve trapped UN 
soldiers and reopen a key airport, officials said here Tuesday 
[18 January]. UN officials confirmed the Bosnian Serbs had 
already agreed to the replacement of some 180 Canadian troops 
stranded for six months in the eastern enclave of Srebrenica, 
making military action unnecessary. The assessments were 
contained in a report handed Monday to UN secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali by Yasushi Akashi, his special 
representative for the former Yugoslavia, the officials said. 
[passage omitted] 
  Marrak Goulding, deputy UN secretary general for political 
affairs, was dispatched to Brussels on Tuesday to brief Manfred 
Woerner, secretary general of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation, on the UN plans. UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees Sadako Ogata welcomed Akashi's call to avoid air 
strikes on the Serbs. "It was not a solution," she told AFP. "It 
would have been an all-out war and what do we do after that?"

<F P=106> [Report by Jiri Horacek: "Defense Minister Baudys Evaluates </F>
Results of Army Transformation"] 
  [Text] At a news conference yesterday, Defense Minister 
Antonin Baudys summarized the results of the transformation of 
the Army of the Czech Republic. He pointed out that the main 
task of his ministry was to carry out the transformation of the 
army without threatening its combat and mobilization readiness 
and operability. 
  "Significant reorganization took place. Changes occurred in 
certain high-ranking Defense Ministry posts," Baudys said. 
According to him, the officer corps has undergone an 
extraordinary screening. During the past year, 4,303 officers 
left the Army -- 45 percent of them were colonels and lieutenant 
colonels, and 20 were generals. He said, however, that 
personnel problems continue because the departure of young 
officers and NCO's could not be stopped. He reported that new 
operational levels of command have been established. These 
changes concern Hradec Kralove tactical air force command, the 
4th air defense company, and Stara Boleslav logistics command 
(Logistics is the science of rear-echelon combat service support 
using modern methods). The Air Force and Air Defense Command 
has been abolished, and so was the command of the 2d and 3d air 
defense divisions. "A new mechanized brigade emerged in Susice 
as a new standard element of ground forces, and the organization 
of three more brigades is in the works. One of them will be a 
rapid deployment brigade, approximately 3,500 men strong," 
Baudys stated. In a discussion with reporters, he asserted that 
he maintains the statement he made last year, when he described 
as traitors to the country all the professional soldiers who 
approved of the 1968 USSR aggression against Czechoslovakia. 
"It is not possible in practice to bring about the departure 
from the army of all these people. There are so many of them 
that we would have to dissolve the Army, and organize a 
completely new one," Baudys added.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladislav Jovanovic, federal minister for </F>
foreign affairs, by Dragan Colovic; place and date not given; 
from the "An Argument More" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Colovic] Good day, Mr. Jovanovic. 
  [Jovanovic] Good day. 
  [Colovic] A lot of hullabaloo is being raised these days on 
the occasion of the NATO summit in Brussels because of the 
threats of air raids on Serbian positions in Bosnia. What do 
these threats mean? 
  [Jovanovic] They are a part of the total, rather incoherent 
approach by NATO and the leading Western powers to the Bosnian 
crisis. Hiding behind this is their indecision as to whether it 
is more in their interest for peace to be immediately 
established in Bosnia or for sanctions against Yugoslavia to be 
continued. This indecision or, how shall I put it, failure to 
show complete determination is being skillfully used by the 
Muslim side in Bosnia (?and) the Islamic bloc of countries to 
strengthen the war option. As regards NATO, the positive thing 
in its stand is the orientation toward a political solution to 
the dispute as the only road that can be followed in the future. 
  However, this positive orientation toward negotiations and a 
political solution to the crisis is not supported by an explicit 
and definite stand for directly establishing peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is because the illusion has been 
prolonged to the Islamic side in Bosnia and in the world that by 
obstructing peace by various procedural reasons and artificial 
questions that they can ask subsequently, they can gain more 
than by concluding a peace. At the same time, this is the 
weakest side in the NATO meeting. As regards those threats that 
have been voiced, they express the vestiges of this double 
standard and I would say a further divorce from the Bosnian 
reality. At the time when the non-Serbian sides in Bosnia are 
waging real and very bloody battles against each other, and the 
Serbian side in Bosnia is only defending itself from 
provocations and attacks from the Muslim side, it is the Serbian 
side that is singled out as the target of possible air raids and 
the other two are not even mentioned. This is not only a 
deviation from reality, but also is not helpful for overcoming 
the present military situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
accelerating this peace process. 
  It goes without saying that these threats include many 
expressions of disagreement and difference of views on the 
interests of many factors within NATO itself. It goes without 
saying that they include much tactical political pressure in the 
expectation that it will show its worth in Geneva on 18 January 
where the Muslim side would subsequently grab some more 
territorial concessions apart from those that the plan of action 
of the European Union demanded. 
  [Colovic] Mr. Jovanovic, Yasushi Akashi, special envoy to 
the UN secretary general, visited Belgrade yesterday. To what 
extent did the talks that Akashi had with Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic and FRY Prime Minister Kontic help clear up 
this question, which is very important and serious for peace not 
only in Bosnia? 
  [Jovanovic] I think that both meetings helped a lot, because 
they firmly stuck to the ground, to the facts and the reality, 
and started from an uncompromising commitment to a political 
solution to the crisis in Bosnia exclusively through peaceful 
means. This is a significant correction to the euphoric and 
somewhat militant mood that existed in the work of the NATO 
meeting and in its final document. On the other hand, it is 
also support for the meeting in Geneva on 18 January, where 
pleas are being made to mobilize all political efforts on all 
sides with a view to finally putting an end to the war in Bosnia 
and establishing a final peace. 
  Mr. Akashi presented himself as an absolutely astute and 
responsible person, who attaches high importance to this aim, to 
ending peace by peaceful means and establishing peace in the 
shortest and quickest way possible. In that respect he engages 
the entire authority of the United Nations and its secretary 
general in the correct way and with the correct means. In the 
talks with our representatives, he could see for himself once 
again that Yugoslavia is absolutely a peaceful factor and that 
in this respect the United Nations and Mr. Akashi can count on 
our permanently constructive cooperation. It goes without 
saying that this is cooperation that would take care of the 
equality and legitimacy of all three sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and would not start from the point that only one, the Serbian 
side, should make endless concessions to the others. 
  [Colovic] Mr. Jovanovic, talks between Croatian President 
Tudjman and Muslim President Izetbegovic were held recently. It 
appears that they were unsuccessful and were followed by a very 
belligerent statement by the Muslim president. Can you explain 
this? 
  [Jovanovic] This can be easily explained. There has been no 
adequate reaction to any of the belligerence of the 
fundamentalist leadership in Sarajevo on the part of the 
international community and particularly on the part of these 
who are directly involved in solving the Bosnian crisis. There 
has been no adequate reaction on the part of the European Union, 
the Security Council, the United Nations, an even on the part of 
the two cochairmen, although one must admit that they were most 
objective and most direct in observing the negative aspects of 
the Bosnian Muslim stance (?thus far). Mr. Izetbegovic is 
obviously encouraged by such concessions and at the same time 
strongly supported by the Islamic Bloc throughout the world. He 
found food for his illusion that by further obstructing peace 
and mobilizing every potential with the goal of lifting the 
embargo on arms imports -- promised to him by some sides -- he 
will be able to radically turn the situation to his own 
advantage. This illusion is very dangerous and, as the Italian 
foreign minister said a few days ago -- it also represents the 
greatest enemy of peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Colovic] Finally, you mentioned the continuation of the 
Geneva negotiations on 18 January. What can be expected from 
this, if I remember correctly, 16th meeting? 
  [Jovanovic] For a long time, for several months, we have 
expected every such meeting to be the last and to put an end to 
war and a roof to the building of peace. In this respect our 
side -- and I include here the Serbian side in Bosna as well-- 
has a completely clear conscience. Meanwhile what the world 
demanded of us: A joint Serbian-Croatian proposal and 
concessions guaranteeing Muslims in Bosnia one-third of the 
territory, has been reached, and from that moment on the world 
should have been addressing the Muslim side alone. The Muslim 
side should finally be told to stop this game of hide-and-seek 
with the world and with peace, and state finally whether it is 
in favor of peace, as its basic demand has been accepted, or if 
it is in favor of war -- so we can know what we are going to 
talk about. We think that in Geneva on the 18th, if that 
meeting takes place at all, the international community will 
talk with the only side that is still obstructing peace in such 
an obvious and direct manner. 
  [Colovic ] Therefore, peace depends on the Muslim side 
regardless. Thank you Mr. Jovanovic, on behalf of the listeners 
of the "An Argument More" program. Thank you very much. 
  [Jovanovic] Not at all. Thank you and goodbye.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 12 (CTK) -- The Czechs and the 
Hungarians hold similar views on the NATO Partnership For Peace 
project, Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus and Hungarian Premier Peter 
Boross said after their meeting today. 
  Partnership For Peace is the only possible realistic project 
and both countries want to play an active part in the 
initiative, Klaus said. Both countries see the project as a 
means of attaining full NATO membership, Boross said. 
  Hungary sees somewhat greater potential for the overlapping 
of common interests, in the Visegrad countries (Poland, Hungary, 
the Czech Republic and Slovakia) cooperation than the Czech 
Republic, Klaus said, adding however that he agreed with Boross 
on the extension of concrete and practical cooperation and above 
all on the opening of a Central European Free Trade Zone. 
  Hungary, too, is not interested in building institutions 
reminiscent of the former COMECON [Council for Mutural Economic 
Assistance], but in concrete cooperation, Boross said.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 12 (CTK) -- Slovakia will use the U.S. 
Partnership for Peace project to seek full membership of NATO, 
Slovak President Michal Kovac said in a meeting today with Czech 
President Vaclav Havel. 
  Czech Presidential office head Lubos Dobrovsky told 
journalists that Kovac described the partnership initiative as a 
"great opportunity for central European countries' integration 
into Euro-American civilization and the sphere of European 
values, which are protected and guaranteed by NATO as a 
militarily-formed security structure." 
  Havel's talks with Kovac were one of a series of talks with 
heads of state of other Visegrad Group countries (Poland and 
Hungary) held at Prague castle today. 
  After the talks with Havel, Kovac left for talks with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton. After their negotiations there will be 
a working dinner given by Clinton for his Visegrad partners at 
the U.S. Ambassador's residence.

  [Text] Prague, January 12 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign Minister 
Josef Zieleniec believes that since the Partnership For Peace 
programme was first announced, there has been a shift which the 
Czech Republic finds very agreeable, he said today after ending 
bilateral talks with the other foreign ministers of the Visegrad 
Four. 
  Zieleniec said this shift was the result of the diplomatic 
attempts of the Czech Republic and other countries. The 
political dimension, above all, of the project is now very 
noticeable. It is emphasized that its aim is to extend the 
community of nations holding the same values, which is specified 
in the project in some detail. "This enables a European 
security system to be built on values which we share, on the 
protection of our way of life. This is the most essential part 
of the alliance," he said. 
  He also pointed out that the project stressed the individual 
approach of each country in the space allowed, which was logical 
as it led to differentiation and not to the formation of further 
groupings. From the interviews which he had had with Foreign 
Ministers Olechowski, Moravcik and Jeszenszky, it seemed that 
this awareness was beginning to predominate among the states of 
central Europe. This meant that awareness of individual 
countries' responsibility was becoming fundamental, as was 
responsibility for political and economic stability within each 
country. Under today's conditions, this was the most important 
security consideration. Zieleniec said. This had been helped by 
yesterday's meeting of foreign ministers with American Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher, who saw things almost identically. 
  Asked if during the discussions any criticism of the Czech 
Republic's individual approach to NATO had been voiced, 
especially by Poland, Zieleniec said he believed the Polish 
position was the result of a certain nervousness and also of 
differences between individual Polish politicians. Zieleniec 
quoted the Polish Foreign Minister as saying after today's 
meeting that both parties now shared the same opinion.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 12 (CTK) -- If the Czech Republic 
assumes a more individual attitude in issues regarding its 
integration into European structures, Slovakia will not take it 
amiss, Slovak Presidential Office Press Department Head Jozef 
Sitko told CTK today. 
  Slovakia backs any joint initiative by the Visegrad 
countries 
(the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland), Sitko said. 
But he added that Slovakia did not consider it a sole basis for 
all activities and tolerates the individual partners' right to 
their independent approaches. 
  Sitko said Slovakia fully supported the U.S. Partnership For 
Peace project and would seek to develop good bilateral as well 
as multilateral relations with its neighbors. 
  Asked whether the problem of the Hungarian ethnic minority 
in 
southern Slovakia would be on the agenda of the two countries' 
talks in Prague, Sitko said that this problem was intentionally 
dramatized. He said that ethnic Hungarians in southern Slovakia 
enjoyed standard rights and that relations between Slovak and 
Hungarian residents in the area were not conflicting. In his 
opinion, the problem serves certain Slovak and Hungarian 
politicians as a pretext for increasing their popularity.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 12 (CTK) -- Czech President Vaclav 
Havel and Polish President Lech Walesa accept the U.S. 
Partnership For Peace project, Czech Presidential Office head 
Lubos Dobrovsky told journalists after the presidents' talks 
today. 
  He said that Walesa had not the slightest, reservations 
towards the Czech republic in connection with its individual 
approach towards NATO and the U.S. Partnership programme. 
  Dobrovsky said that it would depend on the course of 
discussion at the working dinner, given by U.S. President Bill 
Clinton at the U.S. ambassador's residence, whether or not there 
would be a joint statement from talks between the leaders of the 
Visegrad countries (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and 
Poland) and Clinton. He said he expected at least one of the 
presidents to make a statement that there is agreement between 
all of them as regards fundamental approaches towards the 
project. 
  Dobrovsky declined to answer a question about whether or not 
the Czech Republic agrees with a joint standpoint or approach. 
  He told journalists that, prior to Clinton's departure from 
Brussels to Prague, NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner had 
informed Clinton of his order to NATO staff that its military 
representatives immediately begin talks with their Central 
European Countries' counterparts on the specification of a 
future Partnership For Peace agreement. 
  Dobrovsky said that it would be up to the Visegrad countries 
how quickly they would start fulfilling their ideas of the 
Partnership Project. The Czech Republic's idea in this respect 
is quite clear, he said, but did not elaborate. 
  At a press conference after the NATO summit in Brussels on 
Tuesday [11 January], Clinton said he would intend to convey to 
the leaders of the Visegrad countries in Prague that the 
Partnership Project was opening up the possibility for their 
becoming NATO members. Clinton said this was a very serious 
proposal.

<F P=106> ["Full Text of Havel's Speech -- CTK headline] </F>
  [Text] Prague, Jan 11 (CTK) -- We are living in a time of 
great historical challenge. With the fall of communism came the 
end of the division of Europe between a democratic one and the 
one subjugated to the Soviet empire. The cold war ended and the 
world stopped suffering from the tension between the 
Euro-American civilization, based on respect for human freedom, 
and the imperialistic ambitions of Soviet communism -- a tension 
that could have been fatal to the human race. An unnatural 
European order, resting on an armed coexistence of its free and 
non-free parts, has collapsed. We are now living in a time of 
dramatic searching for a new order, in which no one would be 
subjugated or endangered any longer, and which would enable all 
European peoples and states to enjoy an atmosphere of peaceful 
cooperation backed by a peaceful arrangement extending 
throughout the entire northern hemisphere. Progress toward this 
new order is a big -- I will even venture to say historic --- 
task of our time and our generation. 
  I view our today's meeting as an important moment during 
this 
journey. The American president's visit to Prague, coming 
immediately after the NATO summit in Brussels, is not just a 
visit to the Czech Republic. It is also a visit to Central 
Europe, and I see it as proof that the United States and NATO 
are well aware of the great importance that stability, security 
and peace in our region have for peace in all of Europe and for 
the security of the United States. Truly, history is amply 
teaching us that ignoring this area never paid off for anyone, 
that instability here always inevitably grew into instability on 
a pan-European scale, that our loss of freedom had pernicious 
consequences for everyone, and that lack of interest in our fate 
or policies sacrificing us for an illusory peace always led to 
general catastrophes. I believe that the west realizes this and 
that its effort to open its political and security structures to 
Central European nations comes not just from respect for their 
desires and interests, but from its own desires and interests as 
well. For me, our meeting is proof of that. 
  Please allow me a few remarks now about the position of the 
Czech Republic on the main themes of this meeting. 
  1. Our country feels it is a legitimate part of Western 
Euro-American civilization, and shares all of its fundamental 
values. It does not see itself as someone looking for a new 
home. We have our home. For centuries, we have helped shape 
its spiritual and political values. If today we are aspiring to 
become a regular member of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization, we do so above all because we subscribe to the 
same values of civilization which it protects, and because we 
want to take part in protecting them. So the issue is not only 
that we, as a small state in an exposed position, seek allies, 
security ties and guarantees, but also that we are willing to 
take our share of the joint responsibility for the fate of 
freedom and democracy on our continent -- the responsibility on 
which NATO was founded. 
  2. The Czech Republic welcomes the Partnership For Peace 
proposal as a good point of departure in NATO's quest for a new 
identity and new role in new conditions. We know that Western 
civilization is an open society in principle, and for that 
reason we consider it logical and right that the alliance is 
actively opening itself up in this way to all European countries 
and is thus assuming the role of a true stabilizing core of 
European security. We also appreciate that Partnership For 
Peace allows individual approaches to different countries. In 
our opinion, everything depends on what specific forms and 
contents the project will take in the various countries. The 
Czech Republic wants to do everything it can to ensure that 
within Partnership For Peace, the relationship between our 
country and the alliance be as solid as possible, to enable us 
to get closer to NATO fast, and to eventually result in full 
membership. In other words, we do not see Partnership For Peace 
as a substitute for full membership, or as the ultimate 
achievement in our endeavor to work together with the alliance, 
but as a beginning of our cooperation as a first step toward 
joining NATO. 
  3. The Czech Republic is well aware that it is neither 
possible nor desirable to isolate Russia, and that the 
relationship between the Alliance and Russia, as a large, 
Euro-Asian nuclear power, should be as good as possible. That 
is in the interests of the whole world. For our part, we have 
been systematically striving to have good relations with Russia, 
Ukraine and other nations of the former Soviet Union, whether or 
not they are members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
True, the journey of the Russian society to democracy and 
market-based prosperity will be painful, complicated and long, 
and the outside world has only limited possibilities to exert a 
positive influence on the internal developments in Russia. 
Therefore, the task now is to develop such a relationship 
between NATO and Russia that will respect all the specific 
circumstances of Russia's position as well as of possible future 
developments. There, too, Partnership For Peace could be a 
point of departure toward that kind of a special relationship 
which, rather than obstruct NATO's expansion, should become a 
natural background for the process. Expansion of NATO would not 
mean bringing an enemy closer to Russia's borders. On the 
contrary, it would mean bringing closer a partner and a zone of 
stability and democracy, and that is in Russia's fundamental 
interest as well. We therefore definitely reject those Russian 
voices that would wish to prevent such expansion, interpret it 
as endangerment, or even call for a renewal of a Russian sphere 
of influence in Central Europe. We are an independent state, and 
we decide ourselves about our affiliations and our policies. 
  4. Naturally, it is for each of our respective countries to 
determine for itself how energetically and quickly it will move 
to give Partnership For Peace a content meeting its interests 
and possibilities. At the same time, however, we deem it 
important to cultivate good relations among ourselves, work 
together wherever it is advantageous to all and in their joint 
interests, and thus maintain a good regional climate. Good 
relations with neighbors are in the fundamental interest of each 
of our countries as well as in the fundamental interest of 
Europe as a whole. 
  As we agreed during conversations with the representatives 
of 
central European nations who are taking part in this meeting, 
our countries have very similar views on the issues I just 
talked about. That surely is a gratifying circumstance, and it 
is to the benefit of us all. 
  The Czech Republic is prepared to accept the NATO offer 
entitled Partnership for Peace and to immediately begin talks 
about its specific content. We are fully prepared to negotiate 
about the relevant protocols and to offer cooperation in all 
areas in which the proposal envisages or proposes it. 
  In closing, please allow me to express my firm belief that 
this Prague gathering will have been successful, that it will 
become an important landmark on the road to a new democratic and 
truly peaceful Europe sharing firm and natural ties with its 
most natural civilization partner, the North American continent, 
and that it will prove to have been a significant contribution 
to the creation of a truly just political and security 
arrangement in the entire northern hemisphere. At one time, the 
city of Yalta went down in history as a symbol of the division 
of Europe. I would be happy if today, the city of Prague could 
emerge as a symbol of Europe standing in alliance.

<F P=106> ["Czech Luncheon Kovac Speech (Full Text)" -- CTK headline] </F>
  [Text] Prague, Jan 12 (CTK) -- Allow me to express, in the 
name of the Slovak delegation, that we consider this meeting to 
be very encouraging. I am the representative of the smallest 
country in the region, which, like others, continues in its 
successful political and economic transformation process, and 
which, as a new country, has recently established its principal 
democratic institutions. We neighbor with all of the Visegrad 
Group countries, and we are good neighbors not only around this 
table. We endeavor to cooperate in all important areas. Issues 
of security, which we have today discussed with our 
distinguished host President Clinton, are among the most 
important. 
  The Slovak Republic accept the Partnership For Peace project 
as an expression of a qualitative change, and at the same time 
an evolutionary process on the road to a full membership in the 
North Atlantic Alliance. The Slovak Republic understands its 
wish to be part of NATO and its system of values as an act of 
utmost political importance, which has the support of our entire 
democratic political spectrum. We wish to create conditions, as 
soon as possible, for the signing of the agreement within the 
framework of the Partnership For Peace initiative, which will 
put a definite end to our efforts to confirm our orientation. 
We strongly believe that it will be understood the same way by 
the member states of the Alliance. We wish not only to confirm 
our aspirations, but also to prove our preparedness to 
participate actively in its projects and missions through our 
concrete cooperation within the Partnership For Peace initiative. 
  I wish to emphasize that the Slovak Republic is not aspiring 
to be a part of the Alliance because it feels militarily 
threatened. We have no enemies in today's Europe. We simply 
have negative historical experiences. We don't want to see 
history repeat itself in any manner. For this reason we 
endeavor to anchor ourselves firmly within the structure of 
democratic states, which is capable of effectively defending 
democratic values, shared also by our citizens. This endeavor 
and the commitments stemming from it will also facilitate the 
complex transformational process that our society is carrying 
out at the moment. 
  The North Atlantic Alliance carried out the fateful struggle 
for democracy in a bi-polar world with success and honor. We 
have no doubts that it will confront the present challenges in 
the same way. One of these challenges is to find a partnership 
relation with the changing Russia and Ukraine in a manner that 
would strengthen not only European, but also global security. 
The specifics of the European power coordinates and their 
relation with the global processes require, in our opinion, an 
active presence of the United States of America in our 
continent. We are pleased that the United states is confirming 
its commitments to Europe. 
  We are aware that the Partnership For Peace project, in its 
implementation stage, will create models for cooperation between 
the Alliance and the individual countries which will probably 
not be identical. The partial differences should not, however, 
become an impulse for the creation of a competitive environment, 
which we consider natural in economics, but risky in security 
issues. The Alliance should, in our opinion, approach the 
principle security issues systematically and through bold 
decisions that take into account a broader geopolitical area. 
  We know that the creation of stable, democratic relations on 
the international scene and the strengthening of security 
require an active contribution of all, not only the most 
influential participants. The Slovak Republic, too, wants to 
contribute to the European stability, mainly through good 
relations with its neighbors. The Slovak Republic takes this 
opportunity to stress once again its preparedness to further the 
cooperation with its neighbors on this basis. 
  Once again, I want to express our appreciation of President 
Clinton's initiative, which made this meeting possible, and at 
the same time express hope that it will become a strong impulse 
for us in further coordination and mutual cooperation.

  [Text] Budapest, 12 Jan (MTI) -- Heads of state and 
government, and foreign ministers of the Visegrad Group 
countries are holding bilateral meetings with each other and 
with U.S. President Bill Clinton today. The only multilateral 
summit of the five delegations was a working lunch hosted by 
Clinton at the U.S. ambassador's residence, where the five heads 
of state all delivered addresses. 
  At the summit, Hungarian President Arpad Goncz called the 
"Partnership for Peace" an initiative of great significance 
which creates a realistic framework for Hungary and the region 
to set out on the path towards full security policy integration. 
Addressing Clinton, Goncz said, "your visit to Prague, our 
bilateral talks in the morning and the present multilateral 
meeting are important signals. They show that in this new era 
of world history the United States continues to be committed to 
Europe and to the new and restored Central European democracies 
belonging to the Visegrad Group, which is very important for us." 
  The United States and NATO continue to consider their 
mission 
the full assertion of democracy, pluralism, human and minority 
rights in all former communist countries, Goncz said. 
  He assured Clinton that Hungary will do its best to use the 
opportunity offered by the partnership for peace programme. 
  Goncz said it is important that the programme should be open 
to all the states which seek to enforce principles of democracy, 
market economy and respect for human rights. "Nor should Russia, 
Ukraine or any other state in the region be excluded from 
European security," he stressed. Nevertheless, he admitted that 
differences in the extent of the development and interests of 
individual states have to be taken into consideration, though 
not at the expense of the others. 
  Goncz said the future relationship between the Visegrad four 
and NATO will be a special test of the new East-West partnership 
and of the confidence between the United States, NATO, and 
Russia.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 12 (CTK) -- "I am repeating in Prague 
what I said in Warsaw: It is a step in the right direction, but 
too short," Polish President Lech Walesa said in his address at 
a lunch with U.S. President Bill Clinton and Visegrad Four 
representatives on the American Partnership for Peace plan today. 
  He noted that quite recently Polish representatives had 
signed a declaration regarding Poland's admission into NATO. 
"Well, what happened? How long was it in force? It lasted just 
a few weeks. So no one should wonder about our mistrust," Walesa 
said. 
  "The West is offering us today the Partnership for Peace. 
That sounds nice. A partnership is a union of independent and 
equal countries, which strive for established aim. They are 
equal at any desk, not only at the one whose documents are 
signed. And this initiative lacks this equilibrium," he added. 
  He said in his address that Poles did not conceive admission 
into NATO as changing sides. "Therefore, we believe that NATO 
must remain open also for new members," Walesa stated. 
  He stressed that he felt uneasy when "thinking about the 
fate 
of our continent, its unity and solidarity." The idea that "the 
fall of communism bring the world of the East closer to the West 
and will make the two worlds into one" has not materialized, 
Walesa said. As far as security and economy are concerned, no 
progress has been achieved either, he stated. 
  "The preservation of this situation seems to be in the 
interest of the powerful of this world. The vision of a common 
house is gone. The idea of a divided, confrontational Europe is 
being born again. There is blackmailing Russia which is afraid 
of NATO expansion, in which it sees an enemy. There is the 
hesitating West. And there is us who say: Do not be afraid, do 
not let us accept the logic of the military staffs. Let us get 
rid of confrontational thought," Walesa stated. 
  At the end of his address, Walesa expressed the hope that 
today's talks would bring closer the horizon of "our way to 
NATO."

  [Text] Prague, Jan. 12 -- Following his talks with the 
leaders of the Visegrad Four, President Clinton confirmed that 
the security of Eastern European states "is important to the 
security of the United States", and that at present the problem 
does not revolve around the issue of whether these states will 
be accepted by NATO, but when and how. Clinton, however, did 
not make any new proposals going beyond the framework of the 
"Partnership for Peace", and did not make any concrete offers to 
the group. 
  President Lech Walesa summed up the American proposal saying 
that "sometimes small is beautiful and we believe, this is a 
step in the right direction." 
  President of the Czech Republic Vaclav Havel emphasised that 
the "Partnership for Peace" programme cannot be a substitute for 
full membership of NATO for the states involved. Havel added 
that the Visegrad countries regard membership in the 
"partnership" as the first step on the road to full NATO 
membership. 
  Havel made it clear that the Czech Republic has no interest 
in trying to isolate Russia, but it can make sovereign decisions 
concerning its alliances.

  [Text] Prague, Jan. 12 -- Poland will not block the 
U.S.-proposed "Partnership for Peace" initiative, President Lech 
Walesa said in Prague on Wednesday during the talks between 
Polish and United States delegations presided over by both 
countries' presidents and attended by their prime ministers. 
  Director of the Press and Information Department in the 
Foreign Ministry Wladyslaw Klaczynski told newsmen after the 
meeting that U.S. President Bill Clinton described the 
initiative as opening doors, not setting up barriers. 
  President Lech Walesa stressed Poland's doubts concerning 
the 
initiative in the light of both Polish past experience and the 
present situation. President Walesa pointed out Poland's 
determination to effectively and quickly integrate with the 
European structures which is not intended to work against the 
interests of Russia. 
  Bill Clinton reiterated that U.S. security is connected with 
the security of the central and eastern Europe and said that the 
"Partnership for Peace" is a project valuable as such and is not 
a compromise between doing nothing and full NATO membership. 
  Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, who was referring mainly to 
economic issues, stressed the need to start a "partnership for 
development." Bill Clinton replied that he had encouraged 
businessmen present at the recent E.C. summit in Brussels to 
expand their investments in eastern and central Europe and 
appealed to western leaders to facilitate the access of eastern 
European goods to western markets. 
  President Lech Walesa especially emphasized the necessity 
for 
western Europe's greater effort in the integration processes.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 12 (CTK) -- At a meeting with Czech 
President Vaclav Havel today, Hungarian President Arpad Goncz 
said that Hungary sees the Partnership for Peace as a signal 
that NATO is reckoning with the countries of the Visegrad Group 
(Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland) but that their 
membership would not be automatic, Havel's spokesman Ladislav 
Spacek told CTK. 
  Spacek said that according to Goncz, Hungary does not see 
the 
Partnership for Peace as a substitute for membership, but rather 
as an open opportunity for everyone. He also admitted the 
possibility of individual admission into NATO for Central and 
Eastern European countries. The two presidents agreed, Spacek 
said, that it is necessary to emphasize the stability of the 
region, which they consider a condition for carrying out the 
Partnership for Peace. 
  Havel and Goncz assured each other that in the near future, 
experts from both countries would set up contacts with NATO 
military representatives on preparing the initiative. On the 
topic of bilateral relations, the two presidents agreed that 
they are interested in deepening economic and other cooperation. 
Czech and Hungarian Foreign Ministers Josef Zieleniec and Geza 
Jeszenszky also participated in the talks.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 12 (CTK) -- Issues concerning ethnic 
minorities are guided by pan-European norms which Slovakia 
respects but holds a different opinion of the priority of civic 
and ethnic rights, Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar told 
journalists after his talks with a Hungarian delegation tonight. 
He said that unlike Hungary, Slovakia considered the 
implementation of the ethnic principle in building states to be 
overcome. 
  Meciar said that ethnic conflicts benefited nobody and 
expressed the conviction that Slovaks and Hungarians would 
succeed in coping with the problem of ethnic minorities. He was 
reacting to a question about the role played by the problem of 
the Hungarian ethnic minority in Slovakia in the integration 
processes within the Visegrad Group. 
  Meciar said each of the Visegrad Four countries (the Czech 
Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia) was partly responsible 
for the group's stagnation. He stressed that the possible 
withdrawal of the Czech Republic from the group would probably 
result in its disintegration, not in its transformation into a 
"Visegrad Troika." He added that Slovakia would continue to 
seek cooperation and coordination of its policies with the 
Czechs. 
  In reference to the fact that Slovakia was often omitted 
from 
talks about possible admission of new members into NATO, Slovak 
President Michal Kovac said that U.S. President Bill Clinton had 
assured him that the United States had never excluded Slovakia 
and was not going to do so. This problem was in fact solved 
today when all the Visegrad countries accepted the Partnership 
for Peace project, which gives equal chances to all of them, 
Kovac said. 
  He said it was not surprising that no joint statement was 
adopted at the conclusion of the Visegrad leaders' meeting with 
Clinton, because its main goal was to inform Clinton about the 
Visegrad countries' stands on Partnership for Peace. 
  Kovac said that Clinton had accepted his invitation to 
attend 
the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the Slovak National 
Uprising in summer, though he may send somebody else to 
represent him if he does not come himself. The anti-Nazi 
uprising broke out in Slovakia on August 29, 1944. 
  The economic issues, too, were discussed by the Slovak 
delegation, headed by President Michal Kovac, during the talks 
with U.S. President Bill Clinton, Kovac told journalists today. 
Slovak leaders appealed to Clinton to bear Slovakia in mind 
when investment is considered, which Clinton promised, Kovac 
said. 
  Several countries are striving to become an intermediary in 
trade between Europe, the United States, and Russia, noted 
Premier Vladimir Meciar. The Western economics will follow the 
easiest and most suitable way, he added. 
  Meciar said that some questions of economic relations with 
the Czech Republic were still to be settled. The most delicate 
one is reclaiming joint foreign debts, where the two countries 
should establish a precise strategy, he said. 
  Meciar mentioned the Slovak gold allegedly withheld by the 
Czech National Bank accumulated by the pro-Nazi Slovak state 
during World War Two, and the deficit of the Czechoslovak State 
Bank as the unresolved issues.

  [Text] Prague, 12 January (MTI) -- Central Europe must not 
become a security vacuum, President Arpad Goncz said at a news 
conference after the U.S.-Visegrad consultation in Prague on 
Wednesday [12 January]. 
  Goncz said that the four Visegrad countries -- the Czech 
Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia -- are in agreement over 
all relevant issues, with only minor geographical differences. 
Goncz believed the plan will be tested by concrete cooperation. 
Prosperity is also important -- Budapest approaches security in 
a broader context than the military alone. 
  Prime Minister Peter Boross stressed the peace-partnership 
scheme as the first far-reaching international initiative by an 
American President in office for several years to come. 
  Boross was happy with his talks with his Czech, Polish, and 
Slovak counterparts, and called for greater efforts to solve 
problems delaying setting up the Visegrad free-trade zone.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 12 (CTK) -- Today is a historical day 
of extraordinary importance for further political, security, and 
economic developments in Europe, Hungarian President Arpad Goncz 
told journalists today. 
  He underlined the importance of the Partnership for Peace 
plan as an important element for a stable Central and Eastern 
Europe. It is necessary for Ukraine and Russia to develop 
democratically and to foster good relations both with the United 
States and NATO, Goncz stated. Goncz said that the Visegrad 
Four countries had expressed the same views on important issues 
related to the Partnership for Peace. 
  Hungarian Premier Peter Boross stressed the economic aspects 
of the project and mentioned the planned conference in the 
United States which was to enhance Western investment in Central 
and Eastern Europe. He emphasized the importance of concrete 
steps in military cooperation. 
  Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky said that the 
question of the military exercises in Hungary would be specified 
after NATO General Staff sends its experts to the Visegrad Four 
countries. He added that joint military maneuvers in Hungary 
were first to be approved by parliament. 
  Jeszenszky said that an agreement with Slovakia was not 
possible until the problems of ethnic Hungarians in Slovakia 
were resolved. He stressed that a large number of equally 
important problems of Slovak-Hungarian relations were still 
pending.

  [Text] Czech President Vaclav Havel said tonight that the 
Czech Republic had made it clear it welcomed the Partnership for 
Peace and was ready to start filling it with concrete contents. 
He was speaking after talks between the Czech and U.S. 
delegations at Prague Castle tonight. 
  Clinton said that individual admission of new members to 
NATO 
was theoretically possible, but stressed that Partnership for 
Peace was giving individual countries immediate opportunities 
for military cooperation with NATO. 
  "In the talks, we stressed our will to cooperate with our 
neighbours, we noted closeness of our and our neighbours' 
stands, and stressed that we attach great importance to regional 
cooperation as well," Havel said. 
  He said he was exceptionally pleased by the fact that the 
President of the United States had visited the Czech Republic 
and that Prague had been chosen as the place to meet with 
representatives from neighbouring countries. He said that a 
number of other topics, including U.S.-Czech economic 
cooperation were discussed. 
  Clinton thanked for the warm reception in Prague and 
recalled 
that he was coming to Prague for the second time in his life, 
after 24 years, in the same week, but in a very different role. 
He visited Prague in January 1970 as a student. He said the 
progress made by the Czech Republic since his first visit had 
greatly impressed him just as his meeting with Havel and the 
Czech delegation. 
  Clinton reaffirmed that the security of the Czech Republic 
and other Central and Eastern European countries was important 
for the security of the United States, the whole of Europe and 
the Atlantic Alliance. 
  He said that Partnership for Peace was the beginning of a 
real security relationship which can lead to fully-fledged NATO 
membership. Clinton stressed that the economic dimension of 
security had to be taken into consideration as well. 
  The U.S. delegation also included Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher, White House Chief Thomas Mc Larty, Presidential 
National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, the President's special 
envoys Madeleine Albright and John Shalikashvili, and others. 
  The Czech delegation comprised Premier Vaclav Klaus, Foreign 
Minister Josef Zieleniec, Defence Minister Antonin Baudys, Trade 
and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy, Economics Minister Karel 
Dyba and others.

  [Text] Prague, Jan. 12 -- There is no reason or fear that 
Poland will not accept the U.S. "Partnership for Peace" 
proposals, Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak and Foreign 
Minister Andrzej Olechowski stressed at a joint press conference 
in the Czech capital Prague on Wednesday [13 January]. 
  Attending the meeting of Visegrad group heads of state and 
government with U.S. President Bill Clinton, Pawlak and 
Olechowski stressed that, partly as a result of Polish pressure, 
the original U.S. concept had been broadened to include the 
question of relations with Russia, and the willingness of the 
Atlantic alliance to strengthen the independence of the former 
Soviet republics. Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak stressed the 
importance of the "Partnership for Development," under which the 
United States would make its economy more open to cooperation 
with the states of Central and Eastern Europe. 
  For Andrzej Olechowski, the "Partnership" proposals offered 
enough security to the states of the region, in the event that 
in Russia, "historical reflections took precedence over 
democratic thoughts."

  [Text] Sofia, January 11 (BTA) -- Parliament's December 
declaration stating Bulgaria's readiness to join NATO is a 
parliamentary act which sends a positive signal of this 
country's new foreign policy, reads a letter from Bulgarian 
President Zhelyu Zhelev to National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur 
Yordanov, received at BTA this afternoon. The president 
stresses the importance of the unanimous approval of the 
declaration as a sign of a mature stand on vital national 
security problems in the post-communist era and of the political 
course toward integration into Europe. Parliament passed the 
declaration on December 21, just before its Christmas recess. 
  In connection with the NATO summit on January 10-11 and the 
alliance's decisions on its relations with partner countries, 
the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry today said that the strategic 
objective of Bulgaria's new policy is to provide external 
guarantees for national security and integrate into European and 
Euro-Atlantic structures. There is broad public support and a 
consensus among the parliamentary forces on a future full 
membership in NATO and the Western European Union, reflected in 
the National Assembly declaration. 
  The ministry was pleased to note the willingness to open 
toward the security issues facing Eastern Europe and admit new 
members in the future manifested at the summit. We hope this 
process will be based on equality, taking into account the 
lawful security interests of partner states and providing and 
defining security guarantees in the future, says the declaration. 
  The ministry described the Partnership for Peace Initiative 
as a radically new step in the relations between NATO and 
partner states. It gives an equal start to all countries, 
seeking closer ties and integration into the alliance's 
structures, preventing a feeling of isolation, the declaration 
says. 
  We see the implementation of the initiative as a process and 
as the first stage along the road to a full NATO membership for 
partner states on an equality basis. An essential element of 
the implementation of partnership for peace is the promotion of 
political cooperation, which will ensure equal participation for 
the partners in the respective NATO bodies and pave their way to 
sharing in political decision-making within the alliance. 
  We believe that consultations with NATO in case of a direct 
security threat to any Central or East European country is one 
of the most farsighted and useful forms of political cooperation 
within the partnership for peace initiative, the declaration 
goes on to say. Bulgaria strongly favours a further promotion 
of its practical cooperation with the North Atlantic Alliance 
and its member states and with the partner states of the North 
Atlantic Cooperation Council, it says. 
  "A membership in NATO is the only guarantee for this 
country's national security," said Asparukh Panov MP of the 
Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), upon his return from a meeting 
of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly yesterday [10 
January]. According to SDS's supreme leadership, the cabinet 
failed to make use of the parliament's December 21 declaration, 
by stating more firmly this country's desire to become a NATO 
member and by publicizing the parliamentary decision via 
diplomatic channels. "NATO gave the green light for a future 
admission of East European countries to its structures through 
the Partnership for Peace Plan. The strange thing is that none 
of the alliance's documents names Bulgaria," Asparukh Panov told 
journalists today. 
  "I expected nothing more. We have to be realists," Dimitur 
Yonchev MP of the Bulgarian Socialist Party told national 
television's Repercussions Show this evening. He supports 
Bulgaria's balanced declaration on the issue. The Partnership 
for Peace Initiative contains too many if's for a language like 
English, said Yonchev. He shares the view the plan was designed 
to gain time. 
  "No one is ahead of us and the initiative offers enormous 
opportunities to Bulgaria," said Defence Minister Valentin 
Aleksandrov in televised interview.

  [Text] Sofia, January 12 (BTA) -- "Bulgaria agrees with 
the U.S. Partnership for Peace initiative and will shortly 
accept the invitation to enter into a Partnership for Peace 
contract," the Bulgarian president's spokesman told reporters 
today after a working meeting between Dr. Zhelev and senior 
national security officials was held to coordinate Bulgaria's 
stand on cooperation with NATO. This stand will be set forth 
tomorrow by President Zhelev to Ambassador Madeleine Albright, 
special envoy of U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  At Dr. Zhelev's invitation, the meeting was attended by 
Prime 
Minister Lyuben Berov, Army General Lyuben Petrov, chief of 
General Staff of the Bulgarian Army, Foreign Minister Stanislav 
Daskalov, Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov, Interior 
Minister Viktor Mikhaylov, Nikolay Slatinski, chairman of the 
National Assembly Committee on National Security, and Yunal 
Lyutfi, who is chairing the national security on foreign policy 
[as received]. 
  At the meeting it was decided that President Zhelev will 
sign 
the documents on behalf of Bulgaria, Prime Minister Berov told 
the press. When it meets on Monday [17 January], the cabinet 
will discuss this decision and will form a working group to 
draft a proposal for Bulgaria's participation in Partnership for 
Peace and the actual contractual arrangement. 
  "We had no differences at all and concurred on the 
conclusion 
that Bulgaria meets the political requirements to join 
Partnership for Peace and must not lose momentum because this is 
a way to prove our earnest intentions of integrating into the 
Euro-Atlantic security architecture," Mr. Slatinski told the 
press. 
  On December 21, 1993 the National Assembly voted a 
declaration on relations between Bulgaria and NATO. The MP's 
[members of parliament] declared themselves in favour of making 
use of the opportunities for cooperation with the North Atlantic 
Alliance. 
  On January 11, the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry declared 
Bulgaria's intention of joining the Partnership for Peace 
Initiative. 
  The government Press Office today denied an allegation of 
Mr. 
Asparukh Panov MP of the Union of Democratic Forces that the 
cabinet failed to take appropriate action for the circulation of 
the National Assembly declaration on the country's relations 
with NATO. 
  "I was not exactly surprised to learn about yet another 
slanderous story in the Bulgarian press about our diplomatic 
activities in Brussels," Mrs. Lea Koen, Bulgaria's ambassador in 
the Belgian capital, said on Radio Free Europe today. She was 
reacting to allegations of the KONTINENT daily that she delayed 
the circulation of the National Assembly declaration on 
Bulgaria's relations with NATO by mailing it instead of handing 
it personally to the leaders of the Alliance. According to Mrs. 
Koen, "certain people in the Foreign Ministry have made a 
practice of laying the blame at the wrong door."

  [Text] Prague, Jan 11 (CTK) -- At its meeting today, the 
government refused all the four grounds given by trade union 
representatives for their Monday's [10 January] decision not to 
sign the General Agreement negotiated by the tripartite 
(composed of labor, employers, and the government). 
  At yesterday's meeting of the Czech-Moravian Chamber of 
Trade 
Unions (CMKOS), labor representatives decided that they would 
not sign the proposal for the General Agreement, calling it a 
basically political declaration which did not guarantee the 
fulfillment of unions' demands. 
  The General Agreement concerns work conditions and 
relationships, wage issues, business conditions, employment, and 
social policy, and is the basic instrument for maintaining 
social peace. 
  The trade unions disagree with the cessation of unions' 
presence in public service, demand regulation of higher 
collective agreements, reject wage regulation (in force since 
January 1993), and demand that a way be found for handing over 
the tripartite positions to the parliament. 
  The ministers refused the union representatives' attitude as 
"being of the sort which tries to force the government to solve 
several things which do not relate to the General Agreement at 
all," Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik said. 
  "The nature of the possible union organizations in state 
institutions must be rather different," Kocarnik said on the 
presence of unions in public service. 
  "We categorically disagree with union representatives on 
wage 
regulation," said Kocarnik, adding that in his view the existing 
wage regulation did not prevent the prosperous enterprises from 
increasing wages.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 11 (CTK) -- The American Partnership 
for Peace project is assessed by the coalition parties, the 
Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD), and the Liberal National 
Social Party (LSNS) as a first step towards the desirable 
cooperation of the Czech Republic with NATO, a poll conducted by 
CTK today revealed. 
  The government coalition consists of the Civic Democratic 
Party (ODS), Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), Christian 
Democratic Party (KDS), and Christian Democratic 
Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL). 
  This view is not shared by two opposition parties, the KSCM 
(Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia) and the Left Bloc (LB) 
as they consider it danger for the Czech Republic's sovereignty. 
  Vera Zezulkova, a spokesman for the KSCM, expressed fear 
that 
the project, as a first step to NATO membership, will make it 
possible to "engage the Czech Republic in possible future 
conflicts serving the interest of the powers." She notes that 
the scheme envisages joint maneuvers as well as stay of foreign 
troops in the Czech Republic. "This, of course, does not 
correspond at all to the interests of most Czech people, either 
with respect to our security or to expenses." 
  A pan-European system of collective security, not NATO, is 
necessary for "new European Security," Jaroslav Ortman, a deputy 
for the LB told CTK.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 13 -- Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak 
termed the "Partnership for Peace" initiative as "a construction 
which will alllow for a future integration of central European 
countries with NATO" although it offers no membership 
guarantees. Speaking after his return from Prague late on 
Wednesday, Pawlak said that the supplementing of the 
"Partnership for Peace" by a "partnership for development" would 
give the initiative a "broader dimension." 
"We can not change geography," said Pawlak, stressing the 
significance of economic cooperation between the Visegrad Group 
states.

President Ion Iliescu received a letter of reply from Turkey's 
President Suleyman Demirel saying that Turkey favours Romania's 
application to joint NATO and will back the alliance's decisions 
meeting these aspirations. 
  The letter stresses Turkey's admiration of the progress 
marked by Romania since 1990 and the satisfaction at the fine 
and close collaboration within the North-Atlantic Cooperation 
Council, as well as the interest confirmed by Romania in the 
collaboration with that forum that has brought NATO and Romania 
closer. 
  "We see the Partnership for Peace initiative as an 
operational formula in this period of transition and believe it 
will help enhancing the security, stability and fertile 
cooperation in Europe and around it," the January 5, 1994 letter 
by Turkey's president reads.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 11/01/1994 -- A string of 
projects stipulated in the additional protocol of cooperation in 
health care between Romania and Turkey was outlined to Premier 
Nicolae Vacaroiu by Turkish Health Minister Kazim Dinc during 
the interview at Victoria Palace, on January 11. 
  It is about projects of cooperation in medicine industry and 
cooperation in third markets in this branch, exchanges of 
specialists and experience on intensive care as well as in 
geriatrics and gerontology. The guest also signed in this 
respect the founding act of a branch in Turkey of the Romanian 
Institute "Dr. Ana Aslan," under the aegis of the Turkish Health 
Ministry. 
  Appreciating the additional protocol under negotiation, 
Premier Nicolae Vacaroiu stressed the Romanian Government's 
interest in the development of the bilateral relations with 
traditional partners and especially with Turkey, insisting on 
the future prospects of these relations. 
  At the close of the meeting, Premier Vacaroiu asked the 
guest 
to convey to the Turkish prime minister the invitation to visit 
Bucharest. 
  "I consider the interviews we have had in Romania as very 
useful for both parties," Turkish Health Minister Kazim Dinc 
told the press after his interview with Romanian Premier Nicolae 
Vacaroiu. The Turkish minister referred then to the protocol 
concerning the health field signed in 1991, to the goals of his 
visit, to the ways of developing the health sector, altogether 
subjects discussed during his interview with the Romanian health 
minister, Professor Doctor Iulian Mincu. 
  "We, the Government of Turkey, wish to employ Romania's 
experience in geriatrics and gerontology," said the Turkish 
minister and added that Turkish doctors would come to Romania 
for specialization stages in order to become trainers for 
specialists in the field once they get back to Turkey. 
  An important sector for the development of the 
Romanian-Turkish cooperation is the medicine industry, said 
Minister Dinc, who has remarkably expressed in all his 
statements Turkey's willingness to stand by Romania for the 
better of the worse.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 11/01/1994 -- The law empowering 
the government to issue ordinances and authorizing the 
contracting and guaranteeing of foreign credits was endorsed in 
observance of the provisions of Articles 64 and 74 paragraph 2 
of the Constitution, decided the Constitutional Court of 
Romania, on January 11. 
  The Constitutional Court had been intimated on December 30, 
1993 by 59 deputies on the unconstitutionality of the 
above-mentioned law. They claimed that the law had been 
endorsed consequent to the vote on the report of mediation on 
chambers' divergences that did not meet the legal quorum. 
  In its decision released today, the Constitutional Court 
shows that the quorum is the condition for the parliament's 
chambers to meet in sitting. Therefore, failing to have a 
quorum results in adjourning the sitting. So, one cannot 
mistake the quorum for the vote. Consequently, the 
constitutionality of the quorum condition and of the result of 
the vote shall be assessed on separate moments of the 
parliamentary legislative procedure. 
  As is known, the chamber speaker called the roll before the 
voting to check the quorum and it appeared that 278 
parliamentarians were present, as shown even in the intimation. 
Which makes the quorum valid. 
  It is sustained in the intimation that the constitutional 
wording "the presence of the majority of the parliamentarians" 
means the number of parliamentarians who participated in voting 
and not the number of actually present parliamentarians. This 
mistakes the legal sitting quorum, which is a condition of 
immediate presence before voting, for the voting itself, which 
has a quite different meaning, which is the expression of the 
attitude required for a majority to endorse or turn down an act.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 11 (CTK) -- Chairman of the ethnic 
Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH) Bela Bugar 
strongly protested today against the allegation that he had held 
secret talks with Chairman of the Slovak National Party (SNS) 
Ludovit Cernak with the aim of ousting Slovak Premier Vladimir 
Meciar. 
  "It is tragic that at a time when the unity and sovereignty 
of the Slovak Republic is threatened, Cernak is secretly 
negotiating with Bugar and Arpad Duka-Zolyomi from Egyutteles," 
says a statement by leaders of SNS West Slovak regional branches 
published in the left-leaning PRAVDA today. PRAVDA writes that 
Cernak has called the statement "an utterly shameless and 
immoral lie." 
  Bugar called the report "a dirty political move" with an 
apparent effort to eliminate Cernak. He stressed that the 
latest talks between the MKDH and the SNS had been conducted 
when the SNS had been in opposition. 
  Bugar chronologically listed all the initiatives connected 
with the Komarno call, published on December 6, 1993. He said 
the reaction by Slovak top officials, warning against 
"destruction of Slovakia's integrity," was "out of proportion," 
while their approach to solving the ethnic problems had not been 
positive and contradicted the previous promises. 
  He accused the Democratic Left Party (SDL) representatives 
of 
insincerity as they had received "a year and a month ago" the 
draft minority bill, compiled by Hungarian parties, but they had 
not commented on its wording yet. 
  In connection with dissatisfaction of the Hungarian minority 
with the government proposal of the new 
administrative-territorial set-up of Slovakia, Bugar noted that 
deputies to local bodies in purely Slovak districts were also 
dissatisfied and it is them (local governments) who should have 
the largest powers with respect to the drafting of the law. He 
stressed that the MKDH stuck to the principle taking "also" the 
ethnic aspect into account, but not "only" the ethnic aspect.

  [Text] Tirana, January 13 (ATA) -- Several buses carrying 
Albanian refugees started from Pristina to the Czech Republic 
January 12. In Han i Elezit border crossing between Macedonia 
and Kosova, there were crowds of people waiting to go through 
the border crossing. 
  As ATA correspondent in Pristina Belul Jashari reports, 
another wave of expulsion of Albanians has burst out in Kosova 
recently. To this end several socalled "Tourism agencies" are 
involved which carry out the strategy of Serbs' genocide for 
ethnic cleansing of Albanians in Kosova. The wave of Albanians' 
expulsion was instigated by Serbs' violence and repression to 
expel Albanians before January 15 when entry visas will be used 
in the Czech Republic, which is the principal station of 
Albanian emigrants from Kosova. From there the Kosovar 
emigrants move to Western European countries. According to the 
data of the Human Rights Defence Council in Pristina, more than 
350 thousand Albanians have been expelled from Kosova.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 12 (CTK) -- The hope that good joint 
use will be made of the meetings on European security being held 
in Prague was expressed by Polish President Lech Walesa during 
talks with Czech President Vaclav Havel today. 
  Havel received Walesa in the Brozik Room of Prague Castle, 
thus opening a series of bilateral talks at the highest level 
between the leaders of the Visegrad countries (the Czech 
Republic, Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary). At the same time a 
series of bilateral meetings is taking place between U.S. 
President Bill Clinton and the presidents of Hungary, Poland, 
and Slovakia (Clinton talked to Havel yesterday.) 
  After meeting Havel, Walesa told journalists that he wanted 
to consider, together with the other presidents of Central 
European countries, how best they could serve their nations. 
  Poland is one of the most enthusiastic advocates of the 
fastest possible integration of Central European countries into 
NATO. In recent days the Polish press has also expressed 
dissatisfaction with the way in which the Czechs organized the 
Prague meetings. 
  President Walesa also told the independent Czech daily 
LIDOVE 
NOVINY that he was disappointed at the Czech Government's having 
scheduled Clinton to meet each of the Visegrad heads separately 
instead of there being a joint Visegrad meeting. The Czech side 
had also insisted that a joint statement would not be made by 
the Visegrad Four, he said. If the talks were not successful, 
Walesa said, Poland would be "forced to say that it was the 
fault of the organizers." 
  President Havel has made no statement on today's meeting 
with 
Walesa.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 12 (CTK) -- There are many open issues 
in the U.S. Partnership For Peace project because the programme 
is transparent in nature, Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec 
said after talks with his Polish counterpart Andrzej Olechowski, 
held at Prague Castle earlier today. 
  "We hope that this is a space which we can fill with our 
activities. We hope that these activities will be carried out 
by us as well as the sixteen NATO countries and will soon result 
in our becoming part of NATO, which associates countries with 
which we are linked in terms of human development, history and 
values," Zieleniec said. 
  Olechowski described the partnership initiative as a very 
significant contribution to European security and a constructive 
and optimistic programme. But, he said, he saw a problem in the 
programme's not suggesting clear prospects of NATO membership 
for the Visegrad Group countries -- the Czech Republic, 
Slovakia, Hungary and Poland. 
  "Unfortunately, we see that we must go through different 
preparatory stages in order to join all the Western institutions 
we want to, without a promise that we will eventually succeed. 
This is a critical point of the Polish standpoint," Olechowski 
said.

  [Text] Prague, Jan. 12 -- Polish and Czech Foreign 
Ministers Andrzej Olechowski and Josef Zieleniec stated at their 
meeting in Prague on Wednesday that the Visegrad Group continues 
to exist and that certain "misunderstandings" which occurred 
recently over the relations with NATO should have no effect on 
the Polish-Czech relations. 
  Minister Josef Zieleniec stressed that the strategic 
interest 
of the Czech Republic is to see Poland within the Western 
European structures alongside with the Czech Republic itself and 
other countries of the region. 
  Director of the Information Department in the Foreign 
Ministry Wladyslaw Klaczynski said that Polish-Czech 
consultations on building a European security structure would 
start in the near future.

  [Text] Budapest, 12 (MTI) -- The Prague talks between U.S. 
President Bill Clinton and Hungarian leaders -- President Arpad 
Goncz, Prime Minister Peter Boross and Foreign Minister Geza 
Jeszenszky -- focussed on the security policy situation of 
Central Europe, Hungarian Foreign Affairs Spokesman Janos Herman 
said. 
  In the hour-long meeting, President Clinton confirmed that 
the United States is paying great attention to the region. 
Security in Central Europe, he said, is important for both 
Washington and NATO. 
  The Hungarian delegation welcomed the Partnership for Peace 
plan and reaffirmed their country's preparedness to take an 
active part in it. 
  President Clinton said that security is not simply a 
military 
issue, but also a political and an economic one. The United 
States considers it important to promote economic development in 
Hungary and the region, the president added. 
  The leaders discussed the Yugoslav crisis as well. The 
Hungarian foreign affairs spokesman stated: "I consider it 
important that the Hungarian delegation was able to directly 
inform the U.S. administration on how a neighbouring country 
sees the efforts made so far to settle the crisis in Yugoslavia, 
and what it considers to be desirable steps." 
  The spokesman said President Clinton expressed his 
appreciation of the stability of Hungarian democracy. 
Washington considered the new prime minister's smooth and rapid 
election as a sign of this stability, Herman said.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 12 (CTK) -- Relations between the Czech 
Republic and Poland are not as tense as it might seem from some 
newspapers' headlines, Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus said today 
after talks with his Polish counterpart Waldemar Pawlak. After 
the talks both premiers expressed their countries' willingness 
to cooperate, particularly in concrete economic projects. 
  Pawlak said that, in addition to the Partnership For Peace 
Initiative, partnership for economic development was significant 
at present. He said that frequent contacts between the two 
countries' premiers should be followed up by meetings between 
the two countries' ministers and businessmen. 
  Together with Polish President Lech Walesa and Foreign 
Minister Andrzej Olechowski, Pawlak is in Prague attending talks 
between leaders of the Visegrad Group countries (the Czech 
Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary) and a U.S. delegation 
led by President Bill Clinton.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 12 (CTK) -- Slovak Premier Vladimir 
Meciar said today the U.S. Partnership For Peace project, in a 
legal and a political sense, provides the same chances for all 
Central and East European countries. 
  Speaking after a meeting with Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus 
today, Meciar said, however, he believed that in fact this 
equality did not exist since individual countries differ in 
their geopolitical situation, the extent of their economic 
development and the structure of their armed forces. 
  Partnership For Peace could start a certain process which 
could also be developed individually. That is why the results 
could also be different, he said. 
  Regarding cooperation between the Visegrad Four countries 
(Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland) Klaus said that 
the Czech Republic was currently seeking to find a "common 
denominator" for cooperation with all its partners in the group. 
He admitted that not everything in this cooperation was a 
success but that this "was not caused by individual people on 
this or that side, but rather by the real interests of these 
countries." At the same time Klaus admitted that a "common 
denominator" for cooperation between the Czech and Slovak 
Republic could be higher than between the Czech Republic and 
other Visegrad countries. 
  Meciar said that all the steps undertaken by the Czech 
Republic to protect its political and security interests were 
considered by the Slovak Government fully legitimate. He said 
it was his reaction to some "critical voices which have recently 
come from Poland especially." Meciar said this criticism was 
one-sided, simplified and that the Slovak Government did not 
identify itself with it. 
  Klaus said the difference in the Czech and Polish approach 
towards the Visegrad Four questions and the organization of U.S. 
President Bill Clinton's Visit to Prague was not as big as it 
could appear judging from "some statements of some Polish 
representatives." 
  The two premiers confirmed that their views on the American 
Project Partnership For Peace and on cooperation between the 
Visegrad countries were "close or similar." 
  Meciar expressed satisfaction over the fulfillment of mutual 
agreements between the Czech and Slovak Republics. Klaus said 
he shared this view and especially appreciated the fact that the 
Slovak deficit on the joint clearing account "has been repaid 
promptly." 
  Klaus said he did not see any reason why some problems which 
had appeared in Czech-Slovak relations lately could not be 
solved.

<F P=106> [Report by Mirza Hajric from Geneva] </F>
  [Text] Despite the great efforts by cochairmen Owen and 
Stoltenberg to make some progress, this evening's plenary 
session has failed. The reason is perfectly clear: After 
months and months of excuses and stalling for time, of yielding 
to aggression and genocide, the peace process has faced the very 
reason for its existence -- the aspiration of the creator of 
Greater Serbia for the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. There 
can be no progress in reaching a peace agreement until Serbian 
President Milosevic orders the withdrawal from the minimum of 
territory that used to be the majority Muslim regions. 
Karadzic, leader of the Serb extremists, reiterated again this 
evening that he would not give those territories back, while 
Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia- Herzegovina 
Presidency, stressed that there could be no peace without that. 
  Our delegation came under great pressure to sign a very 
vague 
peace plan. In fact, this is a trick by which the sanctions 
against the rump Yugoslavia would be lifted if an agreement was 
signed that would not guarantee us what we must have. The 
Bosnian state delegation, Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic said, 
cannot separate the organization of the state from the 
territory, since we are forced to speak of the minimum. In 
other words, the two create a whole, which we will not and 
cannot give up. 
  Even though there were meaningless calls for signing not 
only 
a cease-fire but a lasting peace as well, Owen himself rejected 
that, saying that we had had hundreds of cease-fire agreements 
and that there was no need to waste time on them any more until 
something is done on the maps. Owen had a proposal in which he 
presented 15 disputed towns. These are: Bosanska Krupa, 
Bosanski Novi, Brcko, Bugojno, Busovaca, Donji Vakuf, Kiseljak, 
Kresevo, Novi Travnik, Sanski Most, Ustikolina, Visegrad, Vitez, 
and Zvornik. The cochairman's proposal was to reduce that 
number as much as possible so as to reduce the number of 
disputed issues if the international arbitration commission is 
formed, which is supposed to solve each problem on its own. It 
was also proposed for acceptance that the Bosnian republic has 
to have 33.33 percent of the present territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croatian republic 17.5 percent but 
not at the detriment of the Bosnian republic. 
  Even though no solution is visible from this position -- 
although we keep talking about minor concessions on the side of 
the Serb extremists -- cochairman Owen demanded that the peace 
conference continue until at least another round of bilateral 
talks between the Bosnia-Herzegovina state delegation and the 
Serbian and the Croatian sides be held. The Bosnian state 
delegation is expecting the first meeting with the Serbs.

  [Excerpts] [Correspondent Zoran Jevdjovic] Negotiations 
about the future of the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina at the conference in Geneva have been going 
on almost without a break since this morning. Everything began 
this morning with the plenary session attended by all the 
delegations present in Geneva and the co-chairmen. The 
discussion in practice concerned talks between the Serbs and 
Croats, that is, their highest representatives and the 
co-chairmen as representatives of the international community, 
with the Muslim representatives, whose positions remain an 
enigma, and who are trying -- in one way or another -- to avoid 
accepting what is envisaged by the European Union's plan for 
solving the Bosnia- Herzegovina crisis. [passage omitted] 
  During talks with the Muslims at the plenary session, all 
the 
issues pertaining to the European Union's peace plan were 
reviewed with the goal of determining the Muslims' position 
toward the proposals and a type of agreement reached between the 
Serbian and Croatian sides, which envisages the Muslims getting 
33.3 percent of the territory for the Muslim republic in the 
former Bosnia- Herzegovina. As I have already mentioned, we 
have unofficially learned that the discussion was somber, 
primarily burdened by the conflicts between the Muslims and the 
Croats. President Izetbegovic again presented new territorial 
demands, which -- according to well- informed sources -- 
primarily pertain to certain towns in eastern and western 
Bosnia. President Milosevic intervened in the course of the 
discussion, prompted by the positions of the Muslim side and the 
positions presented by the representatives of the international 
community. 
  He said that this peace conference had experienced evolution 
and continuity and that it could not keep reverting back to the 
beginning. The Serbian side, said Milosevic, has approached the 
demands of the European Union seriously and responsibly, because 
it presumed that the European Union had defined its proposal in 
the same way. The European Union's demands, embodied in the 
33.3 percent of territory for the Muslim republic, a temporary 
UN protectorate for Sarajevo and Mostar, and the Muslim 
republic's access to the Sava River, have been fulfilled. The 
Serbian side, said Milosevic, had therefore accepted these 
demands. That is why, upon accepting the European Union's 
proposals, the Serbian side has come to Geneva this time to sign 
the peace plan. There can be no doubt, continued President 
Milosevic, that there can never be a perfect plan in all its 
details, but all the remaining issues can be successfully solved 
in mutual relations after establishing peace and in peace. 
  President Milosevic said that he held the logical view that, 
by accepting the European Union's proposals, the conditions have 
been established for signing the peace plan and ending the war. 
Namely, the remaining remarks and adjustments cannot be a reason 
for continuing the war for any of the sides. That is why peace 
has to be immediately signed, while possible disagreements 
should be left to the interested parties' negotiations in the 
continuation of the talks. If the Muslim side should refuse to 
sign for peace, said Milosevic, in circumstances when the 
European Union's proposals have been accepted, I believe that 
the international community is under an obligation to clarify 
its positions toward its proposal with the Muslim side, while it 
should approach the Serbian side -- which has accepted its 
proposal -- in accordance with its obligation to lift the 
sanctions against the FRY and the Serbian people. This is its 
moral obligation, concluded Serbian President Milosevic at 
today's plenary session at which the Muslims' new demands were 
discussed, despite the fact that the Serbs, and even the Croats, 
have more or less fulfilled everything that has been asked of 
them in order to achieve -- in the European Union's view -- a 
just peace and future mutual life in the former Yugoslav 
republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin recording] [Jevdjovic] What does this [agreement with 
Croatia] mean in practice? Does it mean that the Republic of 
Croatia is still not recognized, or at least not within the 
present borders, the AVNOJ [Anti-Fascist Council of National 
Liberation of Yugoslavia] borders? 
  [FRY Foreign Minister Jovanovic] Certainly. This statement 
means neither recognition nor the establishment of diplomatic 
relations. Both issues call for a separate decision and the 
agreement of the two sides. As you can see from the contents 
[of the agreement signed today], this has not been achieved and 
this was not the objective. The objective was to establish 
communications embodied in permanent offices in Belgrade and 
Zagreb, which should facilitate mutual contacts and strengthen 
the orientation of the two sides [words indistinct] of peace and 
political solutions for the remaining controversial issues, 
which are not few, because their scope is considerable after the 
Yugoslav republics' secession from Yugoslavia [sentence as 
heard]. Therefore, there is no reason for any kind of 
speculation that this decision could mean prejudging any of the 
remaining political issues, least of all the issue of the 
Serbian Krajina, which needs to be solved according to the Vance 
plan in direct negotiations between the legitimate 
representatives of the Serbian people living there and the 
Croatian Government. 
  [Jevdjovic] Does that mean that although the Croats have not 
as yet recognized Krajina, they have -- by accepting this 
document -- given up resolving the situation in the Krajina 
militarily? 
  [Jovanovic] This statement means that as well, although we 
need to wait and see whether this will be strictly implemented 
in practice. However, [words indistinct] a guarantee for such a 
development, it is certain that (?we have made) a significant 
positive step toward strengthening this option toward the 
peaceful resolution of this issue through political negotiations 
with the legitimate representatives of the Krajina. This 
remains in the domain of the Krajina's legitimate 
representatives, and no one else has been authorized to solve 
this, nor do they wish to do so. [end recording]

  [Text] [Announcer Nada Rajkovic] President of the Bosnia- 
Herzegovina Presidency Alija Izetbegovic is on the line from 
Geneva. Good evening, let us hear your assessment of the course 
of negotiations today? 
  [Izetbegovic] Good evening, I wish you all the best. 
According to the information that I have, the city [of 
Sarajevo] seems to be somewhat peaceful today. I am glad to 
hear that, you need some rest from that shelling. We have had 
two very tempestuous days, two hard days. I could say that the 
talks here, the first round of talks ended in a draw, to use a 
chess expression. I am personally pleased with what we here 
today, I cannot say achieved, but I am pleased with the outcome 
of this round of talks. 
  We reiterated our demands for the return of territories, we 
said that we do not wish just any kind of peace, that we want a 
just peace. However, the Serb side was not ready to offer any 
concessions. There was a proposal to let a series of questions 
remain open and be handed over to an arbitration commission 
which would work on their resolution for one to two years. 
However, we did not accept that. The open questions referred 
to the issues of Visegrad, Zvornik, Rogatica, Brcko, Sanski 
Most, Bosanski Novi, and so on. We did not accept that. 
  We said that we could not allow these questions to remain 
open, they have to be resolved; otherwise the conference would 
be considered unsuccessful and would go back to the beginning, 
back to the UN Security Council. This was our stance, and 
consequently this proposal on the arbitration was rejected. 
  In order to salvage this peace process, the co-chairmen put 
forward a proposal that in the meantime the fronts should 
quieten down, hot-lines be introduced and talks be resumed on 10 
February. We believe that the talks, the peace process, should 
not be extinguished. Its extinguishing would not be in the 
interest of Bosnia-Herzegovina and our people. We ought to 
continue with further negotiations. 
  Of course, we are not restricted in any sense, we are not 
going to accept a rotten compromise to the detriment of Bosnia- 
Herzegovina. This is approximately our stance. 
  [Mufid Memija, Sarajevo radio-television editor] How do you 
perceive the agreement between Serbia and Croatia in view of the 
general course of the Geneva negotiations? 
  [Izetbegovic] Serbia and Croatia had their own agreements 
parallel to these talks. They reportedly made some progress in 
this respect, they agreed on the opening of missions. Some tend 
to see this as the first step toward recognition. I, 
personally, do not see things that way, that is not what it was 
all about. I believe that mutual recognition is still a rather 
remote prospect. 
  However, regarding our own problem, I would like to say that 
some headway has been made. This might not only be a modest 
achievement, we will see later on. The Serb side agreed to UN 
administration of Sarajevo over the next two-year period -- 
something it had persistently rejected or made conditional in 
the past. This was accepted unconditionally this time -- we 
consider this to be progress. This is a point we scored in this 
competition. This is the best solution for Sarajevo at this 
moment. It would bring about the lifting of the blockade of 
Sarajevo, the removal of the [Serb] artillery and an end to the 
shelling, as well as to a certain kind of opening of the city. 
This would not be a real opening of the city, but it would 
certainly be a new situation that would enable us to find the 
best solution within this two-year period in conformity with the 
aspirations of Sarajevo's citizens. This was a result we scored 
in these talks. 
  [Rajkovic] But Mr. President, let us talk about the 
negotiations in global terms. 
  [Izetbegovic] Of course, as they would say in politics, and 
this applies to the negative aspects of the negotiating process, 
nothing has been agreed if everything has not been agreed [as 
heard]. Therefore, this is only one of many elements making up 
the mosaic of some future agreement. Such a solution would be 
acceptable if an agreement is signed. This was one of our 
demands, something we insisted on in order to avoid the division 
of the city and find a solution in a more normal kind of 
atmosphere and give maximum prominence to what the citizens of 
Sarajevo want for their city and its future. 
  [Rajkovic] We have learned that you were invited to visit 
Brussels tomorrow. 
  [Izetbegovic] I was invited not to the European Union 
headquarters but to visit the NATO headquarters. I will do this 
tomorrow on my return from here. Unfortunately NATO Secretary 
General Woerner has been admitted to hospital. I will be 
received by his deputy, as Woerner is seriously ill. However, I 
will go there to hold talks in the NATO headquarters. I think 
it will be a useful visit even though I do not expect any 
(?major) results. This is something which could, as people say 
[words indistinct], to visit NATO and hold talks with officials 
in charge. 
  [Rajkovic] After that you are going to Malaysia where Bosnia 
will also be discussed. 
  [Izetbegovic] Yes, Malaysia has organized three 
parliamentary conferences on Bosnia-Herzegovina with 
international parliamentarians taking part. The intention was 
to make the cause of Bosnia-Herzegovina more popular, to make 
the world more interested in Bosnia-Herzegovina. One conference 
was held, as far as I remember, in Bonn, one in London and this 
one will take place in Malaysia. I was invited to be one of the 
speakers along with the Malaysian president at the two-day 
conference. I will probably stay there for one day. Maybe I 
will make a one-day visit to Indonesia and Brunei. Then I will 
return, in order to make my trip as short as possible. I think 
that this visit to Malaysia will be useful because it will be a 
chance to present the situation in Bosnia- Herzegovina in that 
part of the world in the presence of numerous parliamentarians 
from Europe, the United States, and of course from the Far East.

  [Text] Geneva, 19 Jan (TANJUG) -- Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic stated this evening that the two days of 
negotiations have shown who is really in favor of peace and who 
in favor of continuing the war. He pointed at the importance of 
the normalization of Croatian-Yugoslav relations for stabilizing 
the situation in the Balkans. 
  "The basic characteristic of the latest round of 
negotiations 
is the fact that it has shown who is really in favor of peace 
and who in favor of continuing the war", Milosevic stressed in a 
press statement in Geneva this evening. 
  "Despite the media war against Serbia, which has been 
demonized and labeled an aggressor, it is completely clear now 
what has actually happened. 
  A few weeks ago, in this building (Palais des Nations), we 
had serious and, in my mind, responsible talks with 12 ministers 
of the European Union. On that occasion they presented their 
proposal on what was to be done to achieve peace. They put 
forward very difficult conditions -- 33.3 percent (of the 
territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina) for the Muslim side, UN 
administration of Sarajevo, access to the river. This was, as 
you already know well, a complete set of conditions for peace. 
Sacrificing their own interests in the name of peace, the Serbs 
decided to fulfill them, they accepted them and came to Geneva 
to sign a peace agreement. What has happened? The Muslims have 
rejected it. Even after the cochairmen had given their 
additions to it, they rejected it. I am telling you that I know 
well why they have done so. The Muslims do not wish to stop 
their offensive in central Bosnia because they wish to overrun 
the Croats, raze Vitez, Busovaca, and Novi Travnik to the 
ground, conquer Mostar and force their way to the sea, through a 
completely Croat territory. 
  I hope that this round will show what is really happening 
and 
will help to create a more balanced picture of the events in our 
country and in Bosnia-Herzegovina in particular. 
  I believe that the conference will be resumed and I admit 
that I am an optimist. We will have peace despite those who are 
opposed to it, the Muslim leaders and those behind them who 
advise them wrongly," Serbian President Milosevic said. 
  Asked if war would break out after the collapse of the 
negotiations, Milosevic said: "I do not think so. The Serbs are 
the stronger side and they do not want the war and the 
resumption of clashes. 
  Asked if Croatia was in reality recognized within its 
present 
borders by the joint declaration, President Milosevic said: 
"Please understand that your question is linked to a problem 
existing between Krajina and Croatia. This problem can be 
solved only by negotiations between their legitimate 
representatives. As the Vance plan has been activated, it is 
clear that they should implement it mutually. 
  I reiterate my personal standpoint on a very important issue 
we are discussing now. I must say that all responsible Serb and 
Croat politicians must work on normalizing Serb-Croat relations. 
We will do our best to help the normalization of relations in 
general and in detail because it is the main factor of stability 
in the Balkans. Those who want the stability of their states and 
the Balkans will seriously work on the normalization of 
relations between the Serbs and the Croats and in the entire 
region," President Milosevic said in Geneva.

  [Text] Geneva, 19 Jan (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the Serb republic, declared in Geneva this evening 
that, considering today's Serbian-Croatian agreement and the 
fact that the Bosnian Serbs and Croats decided to sign a lasting 
peace, the current round of negotiations is not a total failure. 
  After all that happened it is evident that the Muslims have 
opted for war, not for peace, Karadzic went on to say, stressing 
that the Serbs would exercise maximum restraint in responding to 
provocations. 
  Karadzic said he expected the launching of an all-out Muslim 
offensive, especially in central Bosnia. "If the sanctions 
against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were lifted, the 
Muslims would sign the peace plan," Karadzic assessed, 
underlining that everything now depended on the international 
community. 
  Nikola Koljevic, Serb Republic vice president, recalled that 
the Muslims had been offered a truce and confidence-building 
measures which, as he said, they rejected.

<F P=106> [By diplomatic editor Stevan Cordas; "pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, Jan 20 (TANJUG) -- The agreements reached 
between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.) and Croatia 
and between the Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats to begin 
normalizing the mutual relations have salvaged the Geneva peace 
process and made its resumption on February 10 possible, despite 
the fact that the Bosnian Muslims have done everything to 
undermine it, according to diplomatic circles in Belgrade. 
  Diplomatic circles in Belgrade set out on Thursday that the 
agreements signed between the F.R.Y. and Croatia and between the 
Serb Republic (RS) and Herceg-Bosna in Geneva on Wednesday will 
also facilitate the resolution of the conflict in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  According to the same circles, it is extremely important 
that 
the agreements signed in Geneva proceed from the de facto 
situation which is practically becoming a de jure one. The RS 
and Herceg-Bosna, the states of the Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian 
Croats, respectively, have signed the document on the 
normalization of relations although they have not 
internationally been recognized as sovereign states. At the 
same time, Croatia has signed a similar document with the F.R.Y. 
which is recognized as a state, although its right to continuity 
in relation to the former Socialist Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia is disputed. 
  It is believed in Belgrade that, by signing the document on 
the normalization of relations with the F.R.Y., Croatia has 
abandoned the option of war as a means of resolving its 
relations with the Republic of Serb Krajina (RSK). 
  It is set out in Belgrade in that context that what is 
involved is only the beginning of a normalization process, which 
absolutely in no way delves into relations between Zagreb and 
the RSK and in no way prejudices the eventual solution. It is 
said that the mutual recognition between Belgrade and Zagreb and 
the establishment of diplomatic relations between them has most 
likely been left for the final stage of the process. 
  As far as the Bosnian Muslims are concerned, it is obvious 
that they have in a way been isolated in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
since Wednesday, since their hitherto strategy of insisting on 
the war option has totally been defeated. 
  It is beyond doubt that the Bosnian Muslims will no longer 
be 
able to use Serbs as an alleged excuse when they sit down at the 
negotiating table in Geneva again on February 10. RS President 
Radovan Karadzic was right when he said on the eve of the latest 
round of the Geneva talks that "nothing will any longer be the 
same" in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Podgorica, 20 Jan (TANJUG)--In connection with the 
signing of the joint statement on the normalization of relations 
between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia in Geneva 
yesterday, Vladislav Jovanovic, federal minister for foreign 
affairs, said that the two sides agreed to resolve all problems 
by political means. "I hope that this means renouncing violent 
means, especially war, as a means of resolving disputed issues," 
Jovanovic said in today's interview with Montenegrin Radio. 
  The opening of an office in Belgrade and Zagreb means 
precisely that--not more and not less. This is not the 
establishing of diplomatic relations or the recognition of 
Croatia, Jovanovic stressed. 
  The problem of the Republic of Serb Krajina should be dealt 
with in line with the Vance-Owen plan, through direct talks with 
representatives of the Croatian Government. The Geneva 
agreement does not prejudice the solution for Krajina, the 
foreign minister said. 
  The minister of foreign affairs of the Republic of Serb 
Krajina [RSK], Slobodan Jarcevic said during the same program 
that the RSK views the agreement between Jovanovic and [Croatian 
Foreign Minister Mate] Granic only as the normalization of 
relations between two countries, which he does not oppose. 
  "The RSK adheres to its stance that is must preserve its 
state, and that it must participate as an equal partner in all 
agreements on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. If 
Croatia signed the agreement hoping to return the RSK into its 
state framework, it is wrong," Jarcevic stressed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mile Akmadzic, Herceg-Bosna foreign </F>
minister, minister of interrepublican cooperation, and head of 
the Bosnian Croat delegation at the Geneva negotiations, by 
unidentified correspondent in Geneva on 20 January; from the 
"Picture vs Picture" program -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Dear viewers, our guest this 
evening is Mile Akmadzic, minister for interrepublican 
cooperation and foreign minister of the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna. Good evening and welcome to our studio from 
Geneva. 
  [Akmadzic] Good evening. Thank you. 
  [Correspondent] We can say that you were the head of the 
Bosnian Croat delegation at the latest round of Geneva 
negotiations. In the shade of, let me say, the big signature 
between Zagreb and Belgrade yesterday, a slightly smaller, but 
no less important signature appeared between Pale [the power 
center of the Serb Republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina], so to say, 
and Mostar, seeing that offices, that is, representatives' 
offices will be opened in those towns by 15 February 1994. 
Could you describe that agreement, and what does the phrase 
that there are no controversial issues that cannot be solved 
through negotiations means? What are these controversial issues? 
  [Akmadzic] You see, first of all, we are taking into account 
the current state of negotiations on the future set-up of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the need for a comprehensive peace in the 
region. We are aware of the fact that Europe wants peace, Europe 
insists on peace. The EU has sent us a memo, a demarche in 
which it demands and claims that after long negotiations the 
time has come to reach an agreement on peace. Both the Serb 
delegation and us are aware of that, and -- I am speaking about 
the Serbs and Croats in Bosnia- Herzegovina -- we held talks and 
concluded that it would be good to establish that we favor a 
permanent peace and that we are aware of the fact that, at the 
moment, our disputes are of such a nature that they do not go 
beyond the level that could not be solved by peaceful means. 
Therefore, we are in favor of talks, of a solution to all 
problems by peaceful means between the two of us, and for a 
solution to all problems by peaceful means with the third side, 
that is the Bosniak Muslims or the Muslims as they are referred 
to in documents. 
  [Correspondent] Let us still stay on the agreement between 
Croats and Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina. What are the disputed 
areas? Are they Kupres, Jajce, Posavina? Could you perhaps 
mention some other ones in addition to these? 
  [Akmadzic] I would like to say that the basic thing that we 
have not agreed upon yet refers to Posavina [the basin of the 
river Sava in Bosnia]. Namely, in our earlier talks, in earlier 
conclusions, especially during the talks on the [aircraft 
carrier] Invincible and before that, the map that was offered 
was not satisfactory for the Croats from Bosnia-Herzegovina. We 
put forward new demands in that respect. The Serb side accepted 
to discuss our demands and make some concessions. We have not 
yet defined how many and what concessions, but we said that they 
would be about two percent of the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in northern Bosnia. [sentence as heard] 
Therefore, in that respect, we have reached an agreement in 
principle, but we have not yet agreed where exactly the line of 
separation would be. 
  [Correspondent] Talking about Bosnian Posavina, what would 
be 
the fate of the Serb corridor [between Serbia proper and the 
Serb-held areas in western Bosnia and Croatia] in your solution? 
Will it be cut? How would Muslim demands for access to the 
river Sava fit into that solution? 
  [Akmadzic] You see, the Muslims have demanded and have now 
particularly stressed -- among the disputed towns that they 
stress normally as disputed towns between them and Croats on the 
one hand and them and Serbs on the other -- Brcko. Therefore, 
in that respect, the Serb corridor would have to be cut in that 
area, unless the problem is solved in a way satisfactory for 
both sides -- the Serb and the Muslim sides, and the Croat side 
too; unless it is solved by some technical means -- the earlier 
mentioned overpasses and underpasses and such elements that 
would enable both sides to have free access. I must say that 
this issue has not yet been solved, but I think that, as far as 
the Serb side is concerned, they will definitely have free 
passage toward, let us say, east [Serbia proper]. 
  [Correspondent] That means that this Croat demand for 2 
percent would not threaten the corridor. 
  [Akmadzic] It need not threaten the corridor. We are not 
talking about sovereignty here but about the freedom of passage. 
In any case, they will be able to pass through there unhindered. 
  [Correspondent] Let us remain on the subject of Bosnian 
Posavina, an interesting subject because two members of the 
Bosnian Posavina assembly were present in Geneva -- Kovacevic 
and Stanic -- they took part in the talks as members of the 
Sarajevo authorities' delegation. How did this happen and why 
did they not attend as members of the Croat delegation? 
  [Akmadzic] You see, the assembly of the Croat Republic of 
Herzeg-Bosna, or to be more precise, the house of deputies of 
the Croat Republic of Herzeg-Bosna declared this assembly held 
in Bosanska Posavina illegitimate, illegal. However, we are not 
bent on aggravating the situation in this case. Two people -- 
Ivko Stanic and Ante Kovacevic -- showed up in Geneva as the 
representatives of the Bosnian Posavina Croats. This is the 
second time they were there [in Geneva]. Only now they said 
they were also the representatives of the Croats from central 
Bosnia in line with a decision made by another assembly.... 
  [Correspondent, interrupting] Which you had attended. 
  [Akmadzic] Yes, but this assembly did not reach any 
decisions 
to send them there. 
  [Correspondent] What was decided? 
  [Akmadzic] It was verbally concluded at this assembly -- I 
am not familiar with the procedure governing written conclusions 
-- that two people should go with me to Geneva because it was 
already known at that time that I would be a member of the 
Bosnian Croat delegation. This was not a matter of dispute. We 
brought this up in our talks with the co-chairmen, especially 
after these two people -- Stanic and Kovacevic -- held a news 
conference in Geneva. The co-chairmen explained that they were 
members of the Muslim delegation -- I am using the terminology 
they used -- therefore, they were in Geneva as members of the 
Muslim, or Bosniak- Muslim, delegation. All I can say is that 
such conduct is very damaging to our negotiating position, that 
it has an adverse effect on the atmosphere of goodwill. This 
especially applies to some of their stands on our legitimacy. 
Our delegation in Geneva certainly was legitimate, it was 
appointed in a legitimate way, it was approved by the House of 
Deputies. Sadly, the fact remains that the Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina became divided over this whole negotiating 
process. 
  [Akmadzic] Let us be precise. I would not call it a 
division. These assemblies were also not held in this way, 
especially the central-Bosnian one, which I attended. I 
attended it precisely because I wanted to see what was happening 
and to contact these people. It is, I would say, a meeting of 
Croats, not just from central Bosnia but also from other places. 
For instance, there were people from Livno, Jajce, from 
northern Bosnia who do not belong in central Bosnia. As for 
Sarajevo, according to our Bosnia- Herzegovina terminology, it 
is questionable whether it is in central Bosnia. We know that 
central Bosnia includes the municipalities of Kiseljak, Kresevo, 
Busovaca, Vitez, Kakanj, Vares, etc. I think that there is no 
rift among the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We are united, we 
have a unified stand. These people are living in Zagreb, they 
all met, in this sense it is not a bad idea. It is good that 
they met to examine the political situation and offer to help as 
much as they can. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] In how many places in Bosnia-Herzegovina are 
the units of HVO [Croatian Defense Council] and the B-H Army 
cooperating. 
  [Akmadzic] It is difficult to say. In some places they are 
cooperating of their own free will and in many places not at 
all. For instance, one HVO brigade in Sarajevo -- Kralj Tvrtko 
-- was forced to join the B-H Army's 1st Corps without our 
permission and without any consultations with us. This brigade 
is now still acting under the same name -- Kralj Tvrtko -- but 
is under the direct command of the B-H Army's First Corps. This 
is contrary to our relations and our earlier agreements. 
  [Correspondent] Let us now hear Muslim reactions to 
yesterday's two agreements. We have Ejup Ganic's statement for 
CNN -- which refers to the Zagreb-Belgrade agreement. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Correspondent] We heard Ejup Ganic's statement -- the first 
reaction from....[pauses] I would say it is much stronger than 
the one by Alija Izetbegovic who was in a way more reserved and 
who welcomed the agreement [word indistinct] not to the 
detriment of the third party. Have these two agreements really 
succeeded in pursuing the idea on the division of Bosnia and in 
forcing the Muslims to end the fighting? 
  [Akmadzic] Let me just confirm what you said. Ganic has 
lately been making statements which, I think, may not be 
completely in line with what Izetbegovic or Haris Silajdzic have 
been saying. 
  [Correspondent] Which can be part of the strategy? 
  [Akmadzic] Which can, of course, be part of the strategy. In 
any case, I must say that -- as far as the Croat side is 
concerned -- there is no division of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Until 
now, especially during the war, Croats were the ones who most 
strongly advocated [a single] Bosnia-Herzegovina, but we think 
that Bosnia- Herzegovina can only be what it can be at a given 
moment. A union of B-H republics is presently being considered. 
You know very well, and all viewers and the general public 
know, that we supported the Vance-Owen plan that was against the 
division of Bosnia-Herzegovina. At one point there was 
discussion of a federation, etc. At present it is a question of 
the union of B-H republics -- this is still Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
We are supporting this. Not to support this at the present 
time -- as Ganic thinks -- would mean a division of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, a disintegration of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We 
will do everything in our power to ensure that 
Bosnia-Herzegovina remains to exist in whatever form it can. 
  [Correspondent] Another interesting piece of information 
appeared in our press today: That Muslims have been buying 
weapons and ammunition from the Serbs for gas-dollars from 
Islamic countries. Do you have any information on this? 
  [Akmadzic] Of course we do not have any concrete data, but 
there have been various reports about this. It is a fact that 
the Muslim side -- this is what we are called in the 
negotiations, the Muslim, Croat, and Serb side -- does not have 
any special financial difficulties. They openly say it 
themselves. They get aid from Islamic countries. We also know 
that the Islamic conference's contact group, that is its core, 
has frequent sessions, and that they provide very significant 
aid for the Bosniak-Muslim side. We do not know exactly which 
countries provide the aid, but it is certain.... 
  [Correspondent, interrupting] A more interesting question 
is: 
Do they buy weapons from the Serbs? 
  [Akmadzic] I believe that they buy weapons from the Serbs, 
not officially, but we know that various channels and various 
interests operate there and they certainly buy weapons from the 
Serbs. 
  [Correspondent] Do such things happen between the Croats and 
Serbs? 
  [Akmadzic] According to our official policy -- of course it 
does not, for our interests as regards this are not convergent. 
The Muslim and Serb interests are not convergent either. It is 
possible that unofficial channels exist. It is, however, 
certain that such things do not happen officially. 
  [Correspondent] In the end -- an important issue: The 
international community has increasingly often indicated a 
possible withdrawal of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] units, 
primarily British and French, from Bosnia-Herzegovina this 
spring. What would this mean for Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
particularly for the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Akmadzic] We have been openly told in Geneva by the 
cochairmen that, if the negotiations were to continue in this 
manner, with very poor results or with hardly any result at all, 
the war could then last for a long time, until the complete 
exhaustion of all the sides in the conflict, until peace is 
reached in such a way. It is possible that the international 
community is considering the withdrawal of its forces in order 
to reach that level of exhaustion as soon as possible. Nothing 
has been said or indicated to us as regards this. I believe, if 
the talks continue to yield no success, that this [the 
withdrawal] can happen and that they will let the war go on 
until total exhaustion. 
  [Correspondent] In that case, what would the fighting be 
like, all against all, or some against some? Yesterday, we had 
a report by Sky TV that speculates that, in case of the 
withdrawal and even if they do not withdraw, the Serb and Croat 
units would openly militarily cooperate and fight the Muslims. 
  [Akmadzic] I would not speak about that, but I would stress 
that the Croat side is ready to sign peace with both other 
sides, and that we want peace. The war in Bosnia-Herzegovina is 
completely contrary to the interests of the Croat people, except 
when it is being fought solely to defend it's rights, the right 
to equality, the right to Bosnia-Herzegovina, of course together 
with the other two peoples. In that case we will defend 
ourselves, but we are against resolving problems in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina by fighting. You know that at the beginning 
of the war we were the first to organize ourself for the defense 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina. All of the recent criticism of us is 
without any foundation. We will protect our interests, but we 
will fight for peace.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan 20 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslem leader 
Alija Izetbegovic was told on Thursday at NATO headquarters in 
Brussels that the Western alliance would intervene in the 
Bosnian civil war only at the request of the United Nations. 
  Izetbegovic, who was meeting NATO Deputy Secretary-General 
Amadeo de Franchihis, reiterated the Moslem position for 
resolving the conflict in the former Yugoslav republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as presented at the peace talks in Geneva, a 
NATO spokesman told TANJUG. 
  The peace talks ended on Wednesday without any concrete 
results because Bosnian Moslems again rejected an 
internationally drawn peace plan although the representatives of 
the other two Bosnian nations -- the Serbs and the Croats -- had 
met European demands for ensuring to the Moslems one-third of 
the territory. 
  The NATO spokesman said de Franchihis once again confirmed 
that NATO was ready to contribute to implementing any Bosnia 
peace agreement and help plan any action demanded by the United 
Nations. 
  The spokesman refused to comment on the details of 
Izetbegovic's meeting with de Franchihis save for saying that it 
was informative in nature and that Izetbegovic's visit to 
Brussels was private in character and organized at his request. 
  U.N. General-Secretary Butrus Butrus-Ghali said on Thursday 
he had not received any requests for a military intervention in 
Bosnia and that he could not decide alone on that issue, but 
only in consultations with the Security Council. Butrus-Ghali 
was officially reminded of this by Russia, one of the five 
Security Council members with veto powers, which opposes the use 
of force in Bosnia. 
  Diplomats say that special U.N. envoy in ex-Yugoslavia 
Jasushi Akashi said in a report to the secretary-general he was 
explicitely against the use of NATO troops for a military 
intervention in Bosnia. 
  Well-informed sources say Akashi has established that the 
Serbs are willing to allow the replacement of Canadian U.N. 
peace-keepers in the Moslem enclave of Srebrenica in eastern 
Bosnia, and that the reopening of the airport in 
Moslem-controlled Tuzla is not so urgent because humanitarian 
convoys can reach the area by land. 
  At its summit in Brussels ten days ago, NATO threatened to 
mount air strikes against Bosnian Serbs who the Western military 
alliance alleged would not allow the replacement of the U.N. 
troops in Srebrenica and reopening of Tuzla airport.

<F P=106> [Statement by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman on arrival </F>
at Zagreb from Geneva talks -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] A few minutes ago the Croatian 
delegation returned from Geneva. Our colleague Zeljko Rajic met 
them on their arrival. We would like to warn you that the 
footage that we are broadcasting now has not been edited: 
  [Tudjman] I think that this was the most important document 
since UN Security Council Resolution 871, because according to 
it Yugoslavia, i.e. Serbia and Montenegro, have recognized the 
Republic of Croatia within its borders. Although it has not 
been clearly said, the formal declaration refers to the UN 
Charter and the basic CSCE documents which set out precisely 
that; relations between states are based on mutual recognition 
and the declaration itself expressly says that this is the first 
step in the establishment of both diplomatic relations and 
normalization [as heard] and establishment of interstate 
relations, and in the normalization of Croatian-Serbian 
relations in their entirety, which means that the Serbs in 
Croatia, by this official declaration by Belgrade, are called on 
to regulate their relations with the Croatian Government in the 
Republic of Croatia. 
  This is a victory for our policy which is in line with 
requirements set by the international community, with the 
European Union [EU] requirements and those set by the UN 
Security Council -- that political means should be used to 
resolve the problem of Croatia's UN-protected areas, which are 
actually under Serb occupation; this occupation, as we know, 
came as a result of their being supplied in every sense, both 
with weapons and troops from Serbia. Official Belgrade has now 
given up this forceful policy and declared itself in favor of 
political normalization of the overall relations, and 
consequently has given up the Serbs in Croatia. This is of 
paramount importance. 
  After we had signed it, I had a feeling of having achieved a 
great victory. We will not have to suffer fresh casualties to 
liberate Croatian territories. In the very near future we will 
be able to direct our efforts into building our country in the 
economic and cultural sense. This very act which is of great 
significance must influence the restoration of peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is not as yet certain, as I said in 
the beginning because the Muslim side has continued putting 
forward fresh conditions and because there is no accord there 
when it comes to important issues. 
  As far as the conference is concerned, I likewise have to 
say 
that within the conference we, on our part, offered a new 
proposal to the Muslims for the regulation of mutual relations, 
for the establishment of real friendship, for the cessation of 
fighting between the Muslims and Croats, for halting the Muslim 
offensive against the Croat areas in central Bosnia. 
  The Muslims openly demanded in the course of the 
negotiations 
that Croatian Defense Council [HVO] forces pull out from central 
Bosnia, that is, from Novi Travnik, Vitez, Busovaca, Kiseljak, 
Kresevo etc. Therefore, they made it clear in the talks that 
they wish these territories to become part of the Muslim 
republic, they tried to back this with all kinds of excuses and 
reasons -- all unacceptable to us from the standpoint of the 
Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the strategic interests 
of the Croatian state. 
  We presented our proposal to the Muslims and they gave us 
their paper, their proposal. We have not even started 
coordinating our views -- the Muslims believe war is inevitable, 
they even believe that war between the Croats and the Serbs in 
Croatia is an inevitability and that the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina could hardly be resolved without war. 
However, this evening, prior to take off and our departure for 
Zagreb, we held individual talks -- Deputy Prime Minister Granic 
met with Silajdzic, I had a tete-a-tete with Izetbegovic. We 
tried to agree on the need to establish peace between the 
Muslims and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, to stop the bloodshed 
and seek a basis for lasting cooperation to the benefit of both 
peoples. We agreed to continue these talks and we hope they 
will finally produce some results. 
  We [Croatia and Yugoslavia] signed a declaration and the 
representatives of Herceg-Bosna and the republic of Srpska also 
signed a joint declaration on the cessation of hostilities and 
the opening of missions. All three sides agreed on the 
establishment of hot lines to prevent the conflict from 
spreading. 
  I should also say that we agreed in this declaration on the 
opening of offices -- an office of the Republic of Croatia in 
Belgrade and an official office, a bureau or whatever, of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Zagreb. This is a way to 
establish normal diplomatic relations, to achieve diplomatic 
recognition. I remembered in this context that, following the 
Second World War, when relations between two superpowers -- the 
United States and China -- were frozen, such offices were opened 
after Kissinger's trip to China. Therefore, this is an 
extremely important development. 
  [Tudjman] Let me say this: Some of our people may ask 
themselves: What does this mean now, establishing diplomatic 
relations with Belgrade? Is this a way to return back to 
Yugoslavia or back to Belgrade? 
  I want to make this clear to everyone: This is recognition 
of sovereign Croatia. This is a possibility to incorporate 
peacefully, without casualties and new destruction, all those 
Croatian areas which are currently occupied or under UN 
protection into the constitutional and the legal system of the 
Republic of Croatia. This will not be easy but we have made an 
important step by initiating this kind of resolution. From this 
aspect it was a success of our policy, our reputation in the 
world, our power and friendship that we enjoy from the 
international factors that helped us [as heard]. Not only did 
the Russian representative but also representatives of other 
European states supported this declaration. Therefore, this is 
how one should assess this truly important event in our recent 
political reality. 
  [Reporter] Mr. president, could you describe the role of 
peace negotiators and the pressure by the international 
community via the WEU [Western European Union], NATO, and other 
officials? Did they exert any influence on the two-day talks in 
Geneva? 
  [Tudjman] They have influenced the overall talks. They did 
not have a direct influence on the declaration on the 
normalization of Serb-Croat relations but they supported this 
initiative. Russia particularly supported the initiative, which 
is very important because it means that the main ally of Serbia 
or Yugoslavia is recommending this. This is also a guarantee 
that the declaration will be implemented. Some people at the 
conference had their doubts but it is clear that Serbia, 
Yugoslavia, and Belgrade found their interest in signing such an 
agreement; the situation in which they are, bearing in mind the 
embargo, the sanctions. The international public has accepted 
this declaration with general approval.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Jozo Curic on the Belgrade-Zagreb </F>
document signed on 19 January, including recorded remarks by 
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and FRY Foreign Minister 
Vladislav Jovanovic] 
  [Excerpts] [Curic] The Belgrade Government and the Croatian 
Government today signed a document on the peaceful resolution of 
the crisis in Croatia. [passage omitted] 
  [Tudjman] This is the first step in the establishment of 
normal diplomatic relations. One should recall that, for 
instance, relations between the United States and China, after 
they had been interrupted for many years, were established 
precisely in such a way after Kissinger had visited Beijing, by 
opening up such liaison offices. 
  This is a great step, I would say, of historical importance, 
since this means the recognition of Croatia within its 
internationally recognized borders. [passage omitted on Curic 
speaking about the importance of the declaration] 
  [Tudjman] This means that public foundations have been laid 
down for bringing to an end talks that we have been conducting 
with the Serb population in Croatia, not only on a permanent 
agreement on the cessation of hostilities, but also on the 
reintegration of Croatia's territories that are currently under 
UN protection in a normal way into Croatia's constitutional and 
legal order. Obviously, this will take place gradually by 
opening up roads and their reintegration into the economic, 
legal, and social system of the Croatian state. [passage 
omitted on Curic on other aspects of the agreement] 
  [Jovanovic] Turning our back on military methods represents 
an important step forward in relation to the practice that has 
hitherto prevailed. This is what is probably the most positive 
thing in all this. By this declaration, this decision to 
establish direct communication in the form of these bureaux, 
offices, the two governments put their full weight behind peace 
and the resolution of outstanding problems in a peaceful way. 
  An important problem remains to be solved: That is the 
problem of Krajina, the UN Protected Areas, which is to be 
resolved as envisaged by the Vance plan, through direct 
negotiations between legitimate representatives of Serb Krajina 
and representatives of the Croatian Government. Of course, we 
can provide help in this, but we cannot, neither are we 
authorized, to conduct these negotiations, or to prejudge a 
final political solution in any way. [passage omitted: Curic 
presents further details on the signing of the declaration] 
  [Curic] The Geneva conference, when it comes to peace in 
Bosnia, has not produced any significant steps forward: 
  [Tudjman] Perhaps the conference has never before been as 
dramatic as today. [passage omitted on Curic round-up of the 
meetings today] 
  [Tudjman] It was obvious that some participants were in a 
hurry to reach an agreement, while some others are likewise in a 
hurry to continue the war. Even though all the sides have 
stressed that they are in favor of ending the war, practically 
there have been no results. [passage omitted] 
  [Tudjman] The important headway that we achieved in this 
regard is that we agreed with the Muslims that talks on 
contentious issues should be continued, while the most 
contentious issue has remained their continued demands regarding 
Neum and central Bosnia. We offered them a draft of our 
bilateral agreement, they offered us theirs, but differences are 
so big in this regard that this will probably be discussed when 
the talks resume in Zagreb. 
  They surprised us with their rejection of 17.5 percent of 
the 
territory to be given to the Croats for the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna. They accept 33.3 percent in total with regard to 
concessions that they received from the Serbs, but they are 
putting forward fresh demands to the Serbs, which refers to some 
towns; [Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister] Silajdzic even said 
that he had heard about the 17.5 percent for the first time 
today, although this conclusion was presented within the 
conference and within the European Union. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Croatian Defense and National Security Council 
held its 35th session in the Presidential Palace today with 
Franjo Tudjman, president of the Republic of Croatia, in the 
chair. The Council was briefed on the results of the latest 
round of Geneva talks on the former Yugoslavia and on the 
declaration on the normalization of relations between the 
Republic of Croatia and the FRY, i.e. Serbia and Montenegro. 
  The Council supported the declaration, and assessed the 
normalization of Croatian and Serbian relations as in the 
strategic interest of the Republic of Croatia and a prerequisite 
for the establishment of a new international order in the former 
Yugoslav territory and in this part of Europe and the Balkans. 
  The signing of the declaration based on the UN Charter and 
the main CSCE documents is of great political importance, and at 
the same time confirms the readiness of both sides' signatories 
of the declaration that the problem of Serbs in Croatia will be 
resolved in a peaceful way, by reintegrating UN Protected Areas 
in the constitutional and legal system of the Republic of 
Croatia. 
  International factors supported the declaration, and 
assessed 
it as an important step in the process of finding a permanent 
political solution in this region. 
  The government of the Republic of Croatia will do everything 
in its power to ensure that the provision on the establishment 
of official representative offices is implemented as of 15 
February this year. 
  As for the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- despite all 
peace proposals on the part of the Republic of Croatia and the 
European initiative -- the conference failed to reach a 
permanent solution because of the Muslim side, but the talks 
will continue and the next conference has been scheduled for 10 
February this year. 
  Having given full support to the Croatian delegation's 
consistent stands, the Council expressed hope that the 
resumption of such policy on Croatia's part would bring about a 
permanent and just solution to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Belgrade, 19 Jan (TANJUG) -- Slobodan Jarcevic, 
minister for foreign affairs of the republic of Serb Krajina, 
said today that the joint statement signed today in Geneva by 
the ministers for foreign affairs of the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia "does not infringe on the 
integrity and sovereignty of the republic of Serb Krajina." 
  A public statement signed by Jarcevic says that this joint 
statement, signed by Vladislav Jovanovic and Mate Granic, 
envisages mutual recognition, normalization of relations and the 
introduction of representative offices in Belgrade and Zagreb. 
"The Republic of Croatia can sign international treaties and 
make agreements only for the territories under its control and 
those that are not disputable," the statement says. Invoking 
CSCE documents, as stated, cannot imply the borders desired by 
the government of the Republic of Croatia, but the real ones. 
  Jarcevic stresses that the joint statement by Yugoslavia and 
Croatia in its reference to the UN Charter "relates to those 
provisions that regulate peaceful solutions to disputes and a 
people's right to self-determination," something "that implies 
the will of the people of the republic of Serb Krajina 
articulated clearly at their referendum, the statement 
emphasizes." 
  The government of the republic of Serb Krajina, as stated, 
welcomes the peace process in the area of the former Yugoslavia 
and the normalization of relations between the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia, and believes that 
"this will contribute to the restoration of peace along the 
borders between the republic of Serb Krajina and the Republic of 
Croatia.

  [Text] Concerning the signing of the joint declaration on 
the normalization of relations between the FRY and Republic of 
Croatia, Djordje Bjegovic, prime minister of the republic of 
Serbian Krajina, gave Radio Beograd the following statement: 
  [Begin Bjegovic recording] The joint declaration signed in 
Geneva on 19 January this year between Mr. Vladislav Jovanovic 
and Mate Granic, foreign ministers of the FRY and the Republic 
of Croatia respectively, which envisages mutual recognition and 
the normalization of relations, and the opening of 
representative offices in Belgrade and Zagreb, does not violate 
the territorial integrity and the sovereignty of the republic of 
Serbian Krajina. 
  The Republic of Croatia can sign international agreements 
only for the territory it controls and that are not disputed. 
The government of the republic of Serbian Krajina sees the 
Geneva agreement between Croatia and Yugoslavia in this light. 
The CSCE documents do not imply the borders that the Croatian 
Government would like to have but those that it does have. The 
UN Charter, mentioned in the joint declaration of Yugoslavia and 
Croatia, has these regulations in mind, regulations that 
administer the peaceful solution to disputes and the right of 
nations to self-determination. This implies the will already 
expressed at the referendum by the people of the republic of 
Serbian Krajina, which is well known, not only once but on two 
occasions. 
  The government of the republic of Serbian Krajina welcomes 
the peace processes on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, 
and the normalization of relations between the Republic of 
Croatia and the FRY, in the belief that it will contribute to 
the establishment of peace along the borders between the 
republic of Serbian Krajina and the Republic of Croatia. I 
believe that this agreement opens vast possibilities of great 
interest to all the partners in the region. For example, in the 
infrastructure there are great possibilities for the use of the 
capacities that have been out of use for four years now. I 
believe that thus, in a peaceful way, we can solve these 
problems to everyone's advantage. I particularly think that 
there are no changes in the relations between the Republic of 
Croatia and the republic of Serbian Krajina. That is a problem 
that the republic of Serbian Krajina will solve in the best 
interests of the country through delegations, the government, 
the assembly, and other institutions. I believe that there 
should be more of such agreements, since if we are heading for 
peace such agreements can only benefit us.

<F P=106> [HINA report: "Peaceful Solution of the Crisis"] </F>
  [Text] Zagreb -- The Serbian People's Party [SNS] has 
welcomed the joint declaration initiating the normalization of 
relations between the Republic of Croatia and the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia. The SNS particularly welcomes the 
decision on opening government offices in Belgrade and Zagreb. 
  "This is a step forward toward establishing crucial 
conditions for mutual recognition and the establishment of 
diplomatic relations between the two states," said Milan Djukic, 
president of the SNS at a press conference held on Thursday [20 
January]. 
  He assessed as "positivie and extremely significant" that 
"for the first time in Croatian policy all forces are clearly 
opting for a peaceful solution to the crisis, and Presidnet 
Tudjman is talking about Serbian autonomy in the UN Protected 
Areas, although he has not as yet specified its nature." He 
nevertheless expressed certain reservations toward the latest 
Geneva negotiations, and said that, taking into consideration 
the differences and unprincipled attitude of Europe and the 
world toward finding a solution to the crisis in former 
Yugoslavia, more significant results could not have been 
expected. 
  "This gives all the sides involved in the conflict the 
chance 
to persevere in realizing their aims," stressed Djukic and added 
that this is "more than enough reason for continuing the war." 
  Djukic reiterated the SNS's position that the global 
solution 
of the Balkan crisis lies in relations between Serbia and 
Croatia. He also said that the issue of "how to create an 
atmosphere of mutual trust" remains an open one. In Djukic's 
opinion, Croatia's main problem is the solution of the Serbian 
issue, which should be debated in the Sabor [Croatian 
parliament], along with other pressing issues of internal 
policy, as soon as possible. He added that it was "important 
for Croatian policy to opt for, and clearly understand that a 
compromise is the only solution open to it." "Croatian policy no 
longer has any time for mistakes," said the president of the SNS.

  [Text] Today, some Croatian opposition parties commented on 
the declaration signed in Geneva yesterday. In its public 
statement on the joint declaration by the Republic of Croatia 
and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Croatian Social 
Liberal Party [HSLS] stresses that there is no justification for 
a policy which seeks an ally in an aggressor and an enemy in a 
second victim of aggression. The HSLS maintains that the 
priority task of Croatia's policy should be an agreement with 
the political leadership of Bosnia-Herzegovina's Muslims whereas 
the joint statement by Croatia and the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia will render such an agreement more difficult. 
  The HSLS believes that relations with the Federal Republic 
of 
Yugoslavia can be normalized once it has recognized the Croatian 
state within its internationally recognized borders, the HSLS 
says in its statement. The statement was signed by its 
chairman, Drazen Budisa.

  [Text] Ante Djapic, vice chairman of and spokesman for the 
Croatian Party of Rights [HSP], commented at a news conference 
in Rijeka today on the decision to open an office of the 
Republic of Croatia in Belgrade and an office of the Federal 
Republic in Zagreb. 
  He said that the HSP, the Croatian Pure Party of Rights, and 
the Croatian National Democratic League are demanding the urgent 
convening of a Croatian Assembly session at which the president 
of the republic and the foreign minister should reveal all the 
circumstances under which the agreement with the FRY was signed. 
They are also calling for the rejection of all agreements with 
the FRY until the Serb occupation army withdraws from the 
territory of the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, until all expelled persons are allowed to 
return to their homes, and until the FRY explicitly recognizes 
the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and their internationally recognized borders. 
  Djapic also disclosed that the merger of the three parties 
into the Croatian Party of Rights can be expected in the near 
future.

<F P=106> [Report by Gordana Bralic from Baranja] </F>
  [Text] Among the people on the front lines, in the 
villages, in homes, Milan Martic has been explaining the 
difference between him and the other candidates. If Babic wins, 
we could face disaster, Martic says, and be set back to 
fiefdoms. That would lead to new rifts and clashes. He 
stresses that it is not important to vote for this or that man 
but for the first or the second option. One will lead us to 
Serbia, the other one into uncertainty. 
  [Martic] If my rival candidate were to say that openly, it 
is the option that is committed to a true unification with the 
leaders of the republic of Srpska, the Republic of Serbia, then 
I most certainly would not be here today presenting myself to 
you. [sentence as heard] I would let that man go ahead, and I 
would be the first one to support him. Unfortunately, this is 
not so, and that is why I am here to explain to you that we 
could face disaster with that option, disaster as a Serbian 
nation, which absolutely and certainly none of you here want. 
We do not want -- but it is possible -- to return to Croatia, 
to some kind of districts and counties. If there is no solution 
-- and this is logical -- with the republic of Srpska and the 
Republic of Serbia, then the only solution is with Tudjman, with 
districts and counties. 
  [Bralic] Milan Martic ends all his addresses with the words 
that, if he wins, he wishes his authority to be as brief as 
possible, until the aim is attained and all the Serbian 
countries are united.

  [Text] According to the latest reports, in Croatia there 
are 493,647 registered refugees and displaced persons. This is 
what Adalbert Rebic, head of the department for refugees and 
displaced people, said at today's news conference. 
  Included in this number are 241,492 displaced people and 
252,155 refugees. According to the department's estimate, there 
are about 37,500 unregistered refugees and displaced persons. 
Rebic noted that the number of refugees increases each day, 
particularly refugees coming from the Banja Luka area where 
large numbers of Croats and Muslims are being forced by Serb 
authorities to flee. As regards the announced return of 
Croatian refugees from Germany, Rebic said he believed Germany 
would respect the Geneva Convention and send its refugees to 
safe areas in an organized, voluntary, and gradual way. 
Consequently, refugees would return to Croatia free, Rebic 
stressed, and said that this issue was being discussed by 
high-ranking officials from both countries. Rebic said that the 
EU had doubled humanitarian aid, sending 10,000 tonnes a month. 
Last year's quota was 5,000 tonnes. Despite this, in Rebic's 
words, the humanitarian situation is nevertheless grave.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Zagreb, Jan 21 (TANJUG) -- The new head of the 
European Union's (EU) monitoring mission for the former 
Yugoslavia, Greek Ambassador Konstandinos Yarokostopoulos, said 
he was in favor of reexamining the further implementation of the 
U.N. sanctions against Yugoslavia and assessed that it was 
counterproductive when only one side was exposed to 
international pressure. It is necessary to exert equal pressure 
on all sides in order to have affect on the negotiations, 
Yarokostopoulos said in an interview to the Zagreb weekly GLOBUS. 
  He pointed out that the United Nations wished to exert 
political pressure on Serbia with the sanctions and that their 
effect on the overall economy in this Yugoslav republic was 
obvious. However, the question is whether the political goal 
because of which the sanctions were introduced has been achieved 
or have the sanctions proved to be useless in this respect, he 
added. 
  The U.N. Security Council introduced comprehensive and 
mandatory sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
(Serbia and Montenegro) at the end of May 1992 accusing 
Yugoslavia of aggression against the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The U.N. Security Council did this ignoring 
the fact that a civil war among local Moslems, Serbs and Croats 
has been underway since April 1992 and that there are no 
Yugoslav Army troops there. 
  The head of the EU monitoring mission for the former 
Yugoslavia said it was wrong to think that the sanctions against 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia should remain in force until 
the problems in areas under U.N. Protection (UNPA) in the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Croatia are solved. 
  The republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) is a UNPA. The RSK was 
proclaimed on predominantly Serb populated areas in former 
Croatia in response to Croatia's forcible secession from the 
former Yugoslavia and its attempt to limit civil and national 
rights of the Serbian people. Although the RSK has been under 
U.N. protection since spring 1992, the Croatian Army launched 
three aggressions on it since then in an attempt to forcibly 
establish its authority there. 
  The sanctions are linked to a concrete political problem and 
that is Bosnia-Herzegovina, Yarokostopoulos said and assessed 
the sanctions would be lifted once the war there was stopped.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev by Marc </F>
Semo in Sofia on 19 January: "Regional Stability the Bulgarian 
Way"] 
  [Text] The hosts, the place, and the table are exactly the 
same as five years ago when, on 19 January 1989, President 
Francois Mitterand -- on an official visit to communist Bulgaria 
-- welcomed 12 "dissidents," unknown at the time, at the French 
embassy. They included Zhelyu Zhelev, 57, a philosopher whose 
works were regularly banned and who organized the Club for 
Glasnost and Perestroyka, the first intellectual coterie for 
opponents of the regime. Following the palace revolution that 
ousted Todor Zhivkov in November 1989 and set the country on the 
road to democracy, Zhelev became a unifying force and leader of 
the UDF [Union of Democratic Forces], a heterogenous group of 
the anticommunist opposition. The former dissident, elected 
president in August 1990, met Francois Mitterand yesterday. And 
LIBERATION. 
  [Semo] The former Communists are ahead in the opinion polls 
and, what is even worse, more than one Bulgarian in two turns 
his back on all political parties. After Poland, is it not now 
Bulgaria's turn to fall victim to disillusionment and a certain 
nostalgia for Communism? 
  [Zhelev] There is a real danger of this. These are the 
negative effects of the move toward a market economy. People 
are facing enormous difficulties in their day-to-day lives and 
are having to do without many things. The increase in crime 
further fuels this nostalgia. It is not surprising. 
Dictatorships and authoritarian regimes manage to brutally but 
successfully control lawlessness. Freedom does not mean 
anything to ordinary people with no guarantee of security. 
  [Semo] With the war worsening in the former Yugoslavia, does 
the risk of it spreading to neighboring countries like Bulgaria 
still seem real? 
  [Zhelev] I do not believe the conflict can reach our 
country, 
as we are on good terms with our neighbors. But if Macedonia 
was torn apart by deliberately provoked inter-ethnic tensions, 
we would be directly affected, if only by the flow of refugees 
into our country. A policy of active neutrality is the best 
barrier against this danger of conflagration in the Balkans. 
This means first of all non-interference. Second, the rigorous 
respect for the embargo and sanctions imposed on the former 
Yugoslavia by the international community. But I stress the 
active nature of this neutrality. We cannot remain indifferent 
to the human rights situation and the rights of minorities in 
these neighboring countries. 
  [Semo] In spring 1992, Bulgaria became the first country to 
recognize the Republic of Macedonia as a state if not a nation, 
despite criticism from a large part of public opinion which 
considers the Macedonians to be Bulgarians. On this occasion 
you affirmed the need to break with the major nationalistic 
myths? 
  [Zhelev] We have very close ties with Macedonia: We have a 
common history, culture, religion, and language. But that is 
the sentimental aspect of the problem. The act of recognition, 
on the other hand, represented the acceptance of this state with 
its full sovereignty and its borders. 
  [Semo] Do you believe there is now a need -- in order to 
exert pressure on Belgrade -- to further tighten the embargo or 
consider air strikes? 
  [Zhelev] This embargo, which seriously penalizes our 
economy, 
is already very severe. The real problem is how to ensure that 
these sanctions are respected, also by neighboring countries. 
Any decision to undertake air strikes or any form of military 
intervention must be taken by the United Nations, NATO, or the 
WEU [Western European Union]. But if the international 
community were to choose to use force, it is vitally important 
that neighboring countries should not be involved in these 
operations. That would risk sparking off a new Balkan war. 
  [Semo] Bulgaria -- along with other countries in Central and 
Eastern Europe -- has asked to join NATO, which it sees as a 
guarantee for its security. How do you judge the offer by 
President Clinton for a form of "Partnership for Peace" while 
awaiting possible integration? 
  [Zhelev] It remains the best proposal made to date. But this 
initiative perhaps remains insufficient in security terms, as 
what we are being offered is not the same as that which Alliance 
members are guaranteed. I nevertheless feel it is particularly 
significant as it offers an equal chance to all Central and 
Eastern Europe's new democracies, without categorizing or 
differentiating, which is always a source of tension. 
  [Semo] Since you became president, you have managed to 
defuse 
the problem of the Turkish minority -- one-tenth of the 
population -- which was the most explosive legacy of Communism. 
Is there a Bulgarian model for the ethnic question? 
  [Zhelev] I based my action on the old tradition of tolerance 
of the Bulgarian people. Even after five centuries of Ottoman 
domination, relations between the Bulgarians and the Turks were 
good. The tensions of recent years had been deliberately 
created by the former regime which -- seeking a demagogic excuse 
for its failures -- opted for an absurd policy which violated 
the fundamental rights of this minority group. We felt bound to 
immediately restore these rights, and, in addition, we 
guaranteed active participation in governmental bodies for the 
Turkish minority. One-tenth of the elected representatives are 
Turks and their party plays a key role in the Parliament.

  [Text] The 30-minute meeting between President Zhelyu 
Zhelev and French President Francois Mitterrand has ended. At 
the end of the meeting the French president told reporters that 
the purpose of his visit was to check at what stage Bulgaria's 
preparations are for hosting the Council of Europe session in 
May. 
  Another goal of his meeting is to strengthen 
Bulgarian-French 
economic and cultural relations, stressing economic contacts in 
particular. 
  The French president said that stimulating foreign 
investments is of special importance for Bulgaria. They must be 
directed with priority toward small and medium-size enterprises. 
  President Mitterrand promised to support Bulgaria's efforts 
to achieve an alleviation of the burden of foreign debt.

<F P=106> [Edvin Sugarev commentary: "Preach of State Traitor"] </F>
  [Text] In his Sunday [9 January] speach, delivered on the 
radio, President Zhelev said that anyone who hindered 
negotiations on the foreign debt and concluding an agreement 
with the IMF is encroaching upon national interests and is 
committing an act of state treason. Unquestionably, this is a 
worthy position on the part of the head of our state. 
Simultaneously, this is unprecedented hypocrisy in our modern 
history. 
  This is so because the government of the Union of Democratic 
Forces [SDS] was on the verge of signing an agreement with the 
former creditors on much better terms than the government of the 
Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP], led by his former adviser. 
This government achieved a vague preliminary agreement, which 
could hardly be implemented. Weeks before the SDS government 
was about the sign the agreement, the Bulgarian president gave 
the signal to launch a total attack on the government, and 
personally joined in the attack with unworthy lies and mean 
scripts concocted by the secret services under his control. At 
that stage [former Finance] Minister Kostov warned him that the 
national interests are on the line rather than political 
interests or power ambitions. However, the president, the 
Bulgarian president, preferred to act as if he were deaf. 
  The SDS government also reached an agreement with the IMF on 
a three year stand-by. Berov's cabinet has no chance of 
reaching such an agreement. The tacit coup, again directed by 
this president, foiled that opportunity. The result -- not a 
single dollar for Bulgaria as a credit for more than one year, 
and not a single serious investment. Thus for a year we are 
marking time, something that has completely ruined our economy, 
filled up the pockets of the new mafia, caused record 
unemployment, blocked privatization and land restitution, 
prompted the first steps of hyperinflation, and foiled the 
budget and the new draft budget, whose deficit could bury any 
government. 
  To speak after all this about national interests is only 
political impudence. It is high time that the one who preaches 
to Bulgaria measured his own words and deeds, because following 
their logic it appears that the president himself is a state 
traitor.

  [Text] Belgrade, Jan 21 (TANJUG) -- The signed declaration 
on the normalization of relations between the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.) and Croatia is conducive to peace and the 
resolution of disputes by political means, but, at the same 
time, it does not prejudice a political solution for the Serb 
Krajina, whose future can be decided solely by the Serbian 
people there, F.R.Y. Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic has 
stated. 
  Jovanovic said in an interview published in the Belgrade 
daily VECERNJE NOVOSTI on Friday [21 January] that the 
declaration was the cornerstone of the beginning of a process of 
the normalization of relations between the F.R.Y. and Croatia, 
since he said disagreements which emerge at the peace conference 
on the former Yugoslavia would be resolved only later on in that 
process. 
  The Serb Krajina is one of the open issues, and the F.R.Y. 
can only help resolve the issue by political means and not 
force, since the future of the Serb Krajina is strictly the 
affair of the Krajina people, itself. 
  The joint declaration only strengthens the state of peace 
and 
it does not affect any of the centuries-old rights of the 
Serbian people in the Serb Krajina, Jovanovic said. 
  Asked about the opening of liaison offices in Belgrade and 
Zagreb, which Croatian President Franjo Tudjman has publicly 
interpreted as a diplomatic recognition of Croatia by the 
F.R.Y., Jovanovic said the liaison offices were a transitional 
solution on the way of establishing full diplomatic relations, 
on condition the disputed issues of interest to both countries 
were first resolved. 
  It has been agreed that the liaison offices start working on 
February 15. Serbs in Croatia will be able to seek aid from the 
F.R.Y. office in Zagreb and to present possible complaints 
against the actions of Croatian authorities. 
  Jovanovic underscored the importance of the normalization of 
relations between the F.R.Y. and Croatia for the Geneva peace 
talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina. He said that Yugoslavia and 
Croatia had decided to strengthen peace and, thereby, also the 
positions of the Serb and Croat sides in the resolution of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. 
  The decision of Yugoslavia and Croatia to resolve problems 
by 
peaceful means has unmasked the Muslim side, which has anyway 
identified itself as a side committed strictly to a war option 
in the peace talks held so far, the Yugoslav foreign minister 
said in the interview to the Belgrade daily.

<F P=106> [Report by Szilveszter Varga from Belgrade] </F>
  [Text] Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky will be 
received by his Yugoslav counterpart, Vladislav Jovanovic, who 
said in an interview with MTI that they had been able to 
preserve minimal mutual trust between Yugoslavia and Hungary. 
Jovanovic stressed that Hungary had shown a flexible attitude 
in connection with the application of the sanctions, in spite of 
the fact that Hungarian representatives at international forums 
were still objecting to Yugoslavia's participation in the work 
of these bodies. 
  Belgrade would like Hungary to change this position. 
Jovanovic especially held as a grievance the fact that a few 
weeks ago the Hungarian representative to the UN General 
Assembly voted in favor of lifting the Bosnian arms embargo. 
  Talking about the intimidation of the [ethnic] Hungarians in 
Vojvodina, the Yugoslav foreign minister said that this was 
suggested to them from beyond the border. Jovanovic added: 
Fears that are voiced in Hungary from time to time concerning 
the fate of the Vojvodina Hungarians are absolutely unfounded 
and unjustified. As a matter of fact, many people from Vojvodina 
fled because they were influenced by the propaganda that is 
disseminated in Hungary as well. 
  Jovanovich said that Yugoslav citizens could return home 
except those, of course, who had deserted because until they are 
granted amnesty, the latter are responsible for what they have 
done in the eye of the law. 
  The Yugoslav foreign minister said about the Democratic 
Community of Hungarians of Vojvodina that it was a recognized 
organization and the Yugoslav leaders would assess its operation 
positively as long as it functioned within a constitutional and 
legal framework.

<F P=106> [Interview with Slobodan Rakitic, deputy of the Serbian </F>
Renewal Movement, by Cvijetin Milivojevic; place and date not 
given: "We Represent the Origianl Depos"] 
  [Text] [Milivojevic] Does the open letter of a group of 
federal deputies of the Democratic Movement of Serbia [Depos] 
mean that there exist two Depos's -- the one that was registered 
last year, and another, that ran in the recent elections as a 
coalition? 
  [Rakitic] We are deputies of the Depos that was founded in 
1992. That DEPOS still exists, it still has its Presidency, its 
Council, its founding documents, and a large membership. That 
Depos is registered as a political organization, which is the 
only relevant thing for us. 
  In our letter we inform the public that we shall work 
autonomously within the Serbian Renewal Movement [SPO], keeping 
in mind that the SPO long ago ceased to be a democratic party, 
meaning that all the important decisions are made by the 
chairman of the party alone. The chairman of the SPO alone made 
the decision that SPO deputies were not to take part in the 
assembly debate on no confidence in Nikola Sainovic's cabinet, 
and he alone withdrew that decision again.... For these recent 
elections Vuk Draskovic formed a new coalition, naming it Depos 
again, which is false. The Presidency of Depos did not want to 
protest, fearing a negative impact on the election results of 
the democratic opposition. Because of the event on 1 June 
[Draskovic's arrest], because of Draskovic's hospital treatment, 
and later because of the elections, we, as deputies, did not 
protest. However, as soon as the elections were over, we 
decided to end our political abstinence. We consider that the 
issues of democratic relations within the SPO can no longer be 
postponed. 
  That we are right is proven by the fact that our 
denunciations have not been denied by a single word -- the SPO 
leadership has tried, using already proven rhetoric, to 
discredit 11 respectable SPO members, among them even several 
founders of the SPO. 
  [Milivojevic] So you still feel members of the SPO, do you? 
  [Rakitic] We still feel SPO members, but we believe that in 
general terms something must be changed in the opposition 
parties. It is necessary to legalize factions and trends in the 
parties. Different opinions are a normal occurrence, just as it 
is normal that, in global terms, we hold unified views on 
certain issues. Unfortunately, the way in which the meeting of 
the Main Board is supposed to be held speaks of a different 
attitude -- the meeting will be a trial to the unlike-minded, 
who dared oppose the chairman of the SPO. If they expel us from 
the party, then we shall still call ourselves Depos deputies. I 
expect that the Depos Presidency and Council will soon meet to 
solve disputes between the original Depos and the new one that 
has no continuity. That is to say, we shall be acting as an 
opposition party, although we are already being attacked in 
advance for only benefiting the cause of the Socialist Party of 
Serbia [SPS]. 
  Furthermore, it is very sad that the party's leadership has 
ordered telegrams to be sent by SPO regional boards condemning 
us. In addition, we are receiving threatening telephone calls, 
and we are being blackmailed, while rumors about a secret 
meeting between Slobodan Milosevic and myself have already 
started to circulate. Such paranoia only shows that the question 
of democracy is an essential question for the democratic 
opposition. Tomorrow we are holding a meeting at which we shall 
make a decision regarding our further steps. Yet, if they have 
already condemned us in advance, I see no reason why we should 
attend the meeting of the Main Board. 
  [Milivojevic] Does your open letter have anything to do with 
the previous attempt by non-partisan people to institutionalize 
part of Depos? 
  [Rakitic] Yes, it does. That idea is very close to us, and 
I believe that such a Depos would be deprived of all those 
shortcomings that the opposition is suffering from, such as, for 
instance, the cult of the personality, and suchlike. 
  [Milivojevic] Have you had any contacts with chairman 
Draskovic recently? 
  [Rakitic] Yes, on the eve of the very elections, when he 
asked me to take part in the work of the campaign committee. 
However, in view of everything that was happening in the party 
while Draskovic was in prison, in view of all the accusations 
against me that have been delivered by the people who were on 
hunger strike and were behaving like a group of religious 
fanatics encircled by a rope -- I do not see any way to talk to 
people who are not ready to start a democratic dialogue. All 
the more since it was Draskovic alone who made the decision on 
the coalition, as well as the decision on the candidates for 
assembly deputies. 
  I know that we shall be linked to the SPS, and the State 
Security Service, and it will be said that the right moment has 
not come yet, and so forth. It turns out that one is a good 
member only when one keeps silent, and supports what the 
chairman and his closest aides do. Otherwise one will be told 
that "the opposite attitude suits the regime." In that case any 
action is made impossible, which we do not accept. 
<H5>  [Box, page 4] </H5>
  Belgrade -- "One needs only several facts out of many to see 
that the SPO lacks any democracy. The current SPO differs in no 
way from the Communist Party from the time of Tito's autocracy. 
The SPO has become a private firm of the Draskovic family, 
which employs many relatives of theirs," it is said in the open 
letter to the Main Board of the SPO, that was written by nine 
former republican deputies and members of the Main Board of the 
SPO, among whom are Dr. Aleksandar Taskovic, Dr. Ivan 
Milutinovic, Dr. Predrag Mijailovic, and author Mladen Markov. 
  "The staff policy of the party is completely in the hands of 
Vuk Draskovic and his wife. The basic criterion is the personal 
affinity and loyalty toward the Draskovics. The bodies that are 
in charge of the staff policy according to the SPO Statute are 
regularly bypassed. Also, the financial dealings of the party 
are far from being under any control, something on which the 
Main Board has never received any report," the letter states. 
  Still, Draskovic is receiving many letters of support. Until 
yesterday, letters were coming in from Nis, Paracin, Decane, 
Kragujevac, Gora, Vlasotnice, Kladovo, Osecina, Ruma, Pozarevac, 
and Zajecar....

  [Text] Belgrade, January 19 (TANJUG) -- Leader of the 
opposition Serbian Radical Party (SRS) Vojislav Seselj said 
Wednesday [19 January] he was not optimistic as regards solution 
to the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and that he believed the 
war would last for a long time as the Moslems were preparing for 
a spring offensive. 
  Seselj said in a talk with Bulgarian Embassy First Secretary 
Marjan Raikov that the Bosnian Serbs could not cede more 
territories to the Bosnian Moslems as they have already `made 
too many concessions'. 
  The Moslems were dissatisfied with one-third of the overall 
territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina which was supplied mostly by the 
concessions provided by the Bosnian Serbs. Seselj, who is head 
of the SRS deputy club in the Federal parliament, also said he 
urged as close as possible rapprochement between the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. 
  Setting out he did not oppose an independent former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia (F.Y.R.M.), Seselj stated doubt that its 
independence was possible because, as he said, of the threats 
from the neighboring Albania. The Albanian national minority 
accounts for 21 percent of the overall population of over two 
million in the F.Y.R.M. the political leaders of the extreme 
nationalistic parties of ethnic Albanians urged secession of the 
western part of the F.Y.R.M., where this ethnic group had a 
marked majority, and joining it to the neighboring Albania. 
  The issue of F.Y.R.M., according to Seselj, would at any 
event have to be resolved between Belgrade-Sofia-Athens, which, 
as set out, could be the only guarantors of independence of the 
F.Y.R.M.

<F P=106> [Report by I. Popovic: "Three Candidates for Prime </F>
Minister"] 
  [Excerpt] The new People's Assembly of Serbia will be 
inaugurated on Monday, 24 January. This will also mark the 
beginning of the process of electing the new republican 
government. As this date approaches, more and more candidates 
for this post are being mentioned. 
  Those who consider themselves to be well informed say that 
there are three candidates for the head of the Serbian 
Government on 11 Nemanjina Street. 
  Milomir Minic, secretary general of the SPS [Socialist Party 
of Serbia] and director general of a big Serbian firm, ZTP 
(Rail-Transportation Enterprise), stands a good chance to form a 
new government. Zoran Arandjelovic, chairman of the previous 
Serbian Assembly and deputy prime minister before that, does not 
have any fewer chances of becoming prime minister either. His 
chances are even greater if one bears in mind that he was the 
head of the SPS' election campaign team at the last elections -- 
the party that convincingly won more seats than any other party, 
123. Milorad Vucelic, director general of the biggest and the 
most influential media in Serbia, the Radio and Television of 
Serbia, has recently been mentioned as the third candidate for 
prime minister. 
  Regarding other people who were mentioned as candidates from 
time to time, it appears that they do not stand a chance at all 
to become the next prime minister of Serbia. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Tellefsen-Popovski Meeting"] </F>
  [Text] Macedonian Minister of Defense Vlado Popovski 
received yesterday the future UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] 
commanding officer for Macedonia Brigadier General Tryggve 
Tellefsen. The present UNPROFOR commander, Fin Saermark Tomsen, 
and the chief-of-staff of the Macedonian Army were also present 
at the meeting. They all discussed the cooperation between the 
UN peace keeping forces in Macedonia with the local authorities. 
  General Tellefsen stated the following for the press: "This 
meeting was the first one between myself and the Macedonian 
defense minister and was of great significance for the future 
stay of UN troops in Macedonia. It is our wish to establish an 
as close as possible cooperation with the Macedonian Government. 
My first impressions of Macedonia are excellent. I like the 
country, and my future job is a great challenge. I believe 
contacts and cooperation will continue as before. To my 
knowledge, UNPROFOR forces in Macedonia, led by General Tomsen, 
have so far made extraordinary good contacts and cooperation. 
There will be no changes in attitude towards the relations on 
my part, I even hope to be able to give personal contribution to 
their further development. According to the plan, I am to stay 
for a whole year in Macedonia. Having in mind the fact that the 
overall situation is improving and the fact that establish 
relations are very good, I believe it will be a pleasant year in 
your country." 
  After the talks, Minister Popovski said they had discussed 
previous results of the peacekeeping mission and agreed they 
were positive from aspects of the political effects and the 
operative tasks of the mission. UN troops will stay in 
Macedonia for a longer period, since the process of calming down 
of the crisis in former Yugoslavia will last for a long time. 
They agreed to continue the previous successful cooperation 
between the Macedonian authorities and the UNPROFOR Command. 
Working meetings are scheduled for as early as today. 
  Now that the Republic of Macedonia is internationally 
recognized, borders are considerably safer and the situation in 
the country is more stable, Minister Popovski stated. 
  The official transfer of duties between Generals Tomsen and 
Tellefsen will take place 25 January.

  [Text] Podgorica, Jan 20 (AFP) -- More than 100 Bosnian 
Serb refugees in Montenegro have been drafted by Bosnian Serb 
forces, with the complicity of local authorities and the rump 
Yugoslav army, an opposition official said Thursday [20 January]. 
  Movement orders addressed to the refugee "reservists" began 
arriving by mail 10 days ago, Montenegro Social Democratic Party 
official Milorad Raznjatovic said here. The call-up is being 
carried out in collaboration with the rump Yugoslav army and the 
Montenegro police, Raznjatovic said. Movement orders received 
by one refugee, sent by the "defence ministry" of the 
self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb republic, instructed him to report 
to a Yugoslav army barracks in Tivat, Montenegro, "in order to 
fulfil his military obligations in the Serbian republic army," 
he said. 
  Should the draftee fail to report, he will be "questioned," 
the orders specify. Bosnian Serb authorities are apparently 
well-informed about the refugees in Montenegro, Raznjatovic 
said, as the movement orders were correctly addressed to each 
refugee. The head of the Montenegro Refugee Commission, Djordje 
Scepanovic, denied any collaboration with Bosnian Serb 
authorities. "The forced call-up of refugees by the country 
they fled from is forbidden by the Geneva Convention on 
refugees," Scepanovic told AFP. 
  The Bosnian Serb forces have often called on the refugees to 
enlist, but "on a voluntary basis, not by call-up orders and 
warnings," he said. The movement orders call on the refugees to 
serve in Herzegovina, in southeast Bosnia-Herzegovina, where the 
Bosnian Serb army is fighting to take control of Olovo, a 
strategic site north of Sarajevo on the route to Tuzla 
[geographical information as received].

  [Text] Podgorica, 19 Jan (TANJUG) -- The Montenegro 
Government submitted a written notice today to the republic's 
assembly to the effect that, following the adoption of a federal 
law on defense, there is no longer any need for Prime Minister 
Milo Djukanovic to perform the duty of minister for defense. 
  When the Montenegrin Government was being formed in March 
last year, it decided that the prime minister, Milo Djukanovic, 
would perform the duty of minister for defense until a federal 
law on defense was passed which, the government explained, would 
specify constitutional arrangements in this sphere and create 
conditions for a uniform discharge of this duty at federal level. 
  Given that the Montenegro Ministry for Defense has been 
dissolved following the adoption of the federal law in this 
sphere, the government suggests that the republic's assembly 
should relieve Deputy Defense Minister Veljko Vukovic of his 
duty.

<F P=106> [Report by Lj. Mudresa: "Not in Montenegro's Interest"] </F>
  [Text] Podgorica -- It is certain that the international 
sanctions will remain in effect for some time. Therefore, the 
healthy part of the economy that can produce and sell its 
products must be stimulated. The new economic program for the 
revival of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has been drafted 
by a team of experts and it would be good if the federal 
government shared the responsibility for the program's 
implementation. This was stated by Vojin Djukanovic, president 
of Economic Chamber of Montenegro at a meeting with businessmen 
and trade union leaders in Podgorica yesterday. 
  However, the majority of businessmen drew attention to a 
number of unknowns contained in the program. Slobodan Lekovic 
took the view that the elaborate program did not take into 
account the interests of Montenegro, above all, those in the 
maritime economy, tourism, and transportation infrastructure. 
"Relations between the two federal units -- Serbia and 
Montenegro -- in their joint state of Yugoslavia have not been 
presented fully and clearly," Lekovic said. 
  Dr. Janko Radulovic expressed the view that reaching a 
political consensus is a very important factor for the 
realization of the program. He stressed that the program must 
be accompanied by a number of operational and legal regulations, 
adding: "The program is more turned toward the Republic of 
Serbia and if it has any pretensions toward the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia, it must respect the specific characteristics of 
the Montenegrin economy more." 
  Danilo Popovic, head of the Montenegrin Confederation of 
Trade Unions, said that it was not questionable that we needed a 
program to solve the crisis, but expressed the doubt: "Who will 
pay for it if it fails. A large number of workers, pensioners, 
and disabled people, according to statistics, are paupers, 
because they are surviving on about 10 German marks a month when 
it is known that the minimum amount of money needed to survive, 
according to international standards, is about 30 German marks a 
month. Trade unions will demand wages to be paid in a stable, 
convertible currency, or the new dinar, or in kind." Popovic 
said that the Confederation of Trade Unions would today 
officially inform the public about its objections to the 
program. This will also be done by the Economic Chamber of 
Montenegro in its assessment that will be sent to the federal 
government today.

<F P=106> [Report by A. Stanojevic: "In Favor of Full Equality"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Vranje -- For those who are not so familiar with 
events in the extreme south of Serbia, the success of the 
coalition of two predominantly Albanian parties could be a 
surprise. The Party for Democratic Activity (PDD), and the 
Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA), both based in Presevo, 
certainly made a wise move during the pre-election period by 
forming a coalition. In this way they prevented a further 
fragmentation of the Albanian electorate in the southern Serbian 
communes of Presevo, Bujanovac, and Medvedja, where these two 
parties are active. 
  Having won almost 30,000 votes, this coalition has secured 
two seats in the future Serbian parliament. The candidates were 
Beljulj Jusufi and Tahir Dalipi. 
  Who in fact are these two parties? 
  The Party for Democratic Activity is headed by Riza Halimi, 
president of the Presevo commune. He was born in 1947 and 
graduated at the Scientific Mathematical Faculty. During the 
ideological and political purge of 1989 he was suspended from 
education. He later worked in the Dzevdet Doda Grammar School 
in Pristina. He had been a leading member of the party before 
he was elected president. 
  The head of the Democratic Party of Albanians is Zecir 
Fazliu, biology teacher in the 15 May Grammar School in Presevo. 
He was born in the village of Zujnice in the Presevo commune in 
1940. He left the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in 1969. 
He had been the director of the school in which he is now 
working, but was replaced before the end of his term of office. 
  According to Halimi, the Party for Democratic Activity 
strives for a multi-party democratic system in which all 
citizens, as legal and political subjects, should be equal 
regardless of their nationality and confession, and in which the 
freedom and rights of people would be guaranteed by the 
Constitution and laws. [passage omitted] 
  The program of the Democratic Party of Albanians promotes 
the 
full, true, and actual equality of Albanians in spheres of life 
where they live and work. At the same time, the party will work 
for the emancipation of women, the equality of man and women, 
the freedom of religion and worshiping, the promotion of one's 
own culture, national history, literature, folklore, and 
historical traditions. [passage omitted]

agreement between Ukraine, Russia, and the United States on 
dismantling the nuclear weapons in the territory of Ukraine, on 
the implementation of the START I treaty. The Hungarian Foreign 
Ministry also welcomes Ukraine's determination to join the 
nuclear nonproliferation treaty as soon as possible. The step 
reduces the danger of a nuclear war, eases the tension 
prevailing in our region, and increases the chance for peace, 
the communique of the Hungarian Foreign Ministry reads.

<F P=106> [Correspondent's report: "Chinese Tanks From Outstanding </F>
Debts?"] 
  [Text] According to sources in Beijing, the Chinese tanks 
fulfill the technical parameters demanded by the Hungarian side. 
A delegation of the Hungarian Interior Ministry held talks 
recently with the Norilco military industry firm on purchasing 
such tanks. The delegation, led by State Secretary Attila Korom, 
left Beijing on 18 January. 
  According to our correspondent, the Chinese side does not 
exclude the possibility of selling the tanks in exchange for the 
107 million Swiss Francs Chinese state debt to Hungary 
accumulated in the course of bilateral clearing trade. However, 
this way, the price is higher than in the case of free currency 
accounting. 
  The Hungarian Interior Ministry is conducting information 
talks on the purchase of 100-150 PSZH tanks, and the Chinese 
offer stands at $375,000 a piece. Thus, the value of the entire 
transaction stands around $50 million. The Nikex foreign trade 
firm has been put in charge of carrying out this purchase. The 
executive manager of this firm, Attila Varadi, who participated 
in the current negotiations, used to be the Hungarian commercial 
attache in Beijing, and later worked at Gyorgy Matrai's 
Autotrade company. Originally, it was the Autotrade that won the 
right to settle the Chinese debt to Hungary, but it failed to 
carry out this task in time, probably due to Matrai's arrest in 
connection with the Samax- affair. Varadi left the Autotrade 
after the arrest of his boss.

<F P=106> [Jaroslav Kmenta report: "Iran Has Apparently Manifested an </F>
Interest in Products From Czech Arms Factories"] 
  [Text] Prague -- Representatives from Skoda Plzen, which 
is part of the RDP Group arms consortium, held talks during 
their visit to Iran in autumn with officials from the Iranian 
Army at the country's Defense Ministry. A diplomatic source 
informed MLADA FRONTA DNES of this yesterday. He added that 
this was supposed to have been an informative meeting concerning 
possible cooperation in the arms industry. 
  Skoda Director General Lubomir Soudek has not denied this 
report; at the same time, however, he has not confirmed it. "I 
am not saying yes or no. I do not think it is anyone's business 
what the talks were about, how extensive they were, or with whom 
they were held. When the talks assume a specific form, we will 
proceed in accordance with the laws," he said. 
  The Iranian regime is described by some countries -- for 
example, by Israel -- as a terrorist regime. 
  Lubomir Soudek denied contacting the Iranians to offer them 
surface-to-air missiles or the Tamara passive radar system. 
  According to the most recent issue of the weekly RESPEKT, 
there exists an internal memorandum by Lubomir Soudek from the 
trip to Iran in which he writes about a meeting at the Defense 
Ministry and about talks with the army. 
  According to this document, the Skoda director was, for 
example, supposed to have briefed Iranian Deputy Defense 
Minister Vaheed on the RDP Group, the Czech company involved in 
the production and sale of weapons. The Iranians were supposed 
to have shown an interest in the new generation of 
surface-to-air missiles, the Tamara radar system, and modernized 
tanks. 
  Soudek has confirmed that a memorandum from his visit to 
Iran 
exists; nevertheless, he said that it is not available to 
reporters. The Skoda director told us the following in 
connection with the talks on the Russian T-72 tank, in whose 
modernization the plant will participate: "So far, we have not 
modernized a single tank; we have nothing to offer. However, if 
Iran is on the list of countries to which the export of special 
materials is prohibited, of course, we will not consider 
exporting there." 
  The Foreign Ministry, according to our source, will ask 
Lubomir Soudek for an official report on his company's 
activities. Czech diplomats do not know anything about 
representatives from Skoda Plzen holding talks with army 
officials in Iran. According to our source, the ambassador of 
the Czech Republic to Iran was only informed of the Skoda 
delegation's visit to the Agriculture and Energy Ministries. 
  "If Skoda Plzen negotiated in Iran as it was alleged to have 
done, then after 1 March -- when the law on arms trading should 
come into force -- it would be possible to regard such activity 
as an offense," said our diplomatic source, without giving any 
details. 
  Lubomir Soudek has emphasized that he held talks in Iran on 
-- for example -- plans for a joint enterprise in the sugar 
refining industry and on the founding of a company to 
manufacture Skoda trolley buses for the Teheran public 
transportation system. "If some people want to turn the 
business trip into a scandal, then they should not be surprised 
if the number of unemployed increases," declared Soudek.

  [Text] The joint declaration on launching the process of 
normalizing relations between the Republic of Croatia and 
Serbia, i.e., Yugoslavia, is a peaceful and diplomatic step of 
exceptional importance, whose global positive effects will form 
the framework for the solution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina war. 
This is said in a letter which the prime minister of the Croat 
republic of Herceg-Bosna, Jadranko Prlic, today sent to Croatian 
Foreign Minister Mate Granic. The government of the Croat 
republic of Herceg-Bosna also supports the agreement on lasting 
peace between Croats and Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and 
confirms its readiness to work on the consistent implementation 
of that agreement, the letter says. We would like the Muslim 
side to sign a similar bilateral or tripartite agreement on 
ending fighting and on peaceful negotiations in all future 
relations. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Obrenovac, 19 Jan (TANJUG) -- Taking into 
consideration the intensive plenary and bilateral negotiations 
in Geneva, it could be said that we are a step closer to peace, 
particularly after the Serbian proposal to immediately establish 
peace and a modus vivendi, as well as solve other remaining 
political problems later, Serbian Vice President Nikola Koljevic 
told Radio Obrenovac today. 
  "Therefore, it is very important the three sides accept the 
establishment of peace and resolve the remaining disputes 
peacefully," Koljevic pointed out. 
  Koljevic said the joint declaration signed by the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia was "a 
significant step for overall Serb-Croat relations," stressing 
that progress was much slower in the negotiations with the 
Muslim side. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Belgrade, Jan 20 (TANJUG) -- Commander of the United 
Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) for Bosnia-Herzegovina, Gen. 
Francis Briquemont, accused Thursday [20 January] Bosnian Croats 
of blocking the efforts to deliver humanitarian aid to Sarajevo 
by road. 
  Foreign news agencies reported Gen. Briquemont as saying in 
Sarajevo on Thursday that Bosnian Croats failed to keep their 
promise given on January 12 by their Commander, Ante Roso. They 
promised to enable UNPROFOR to repair the important Bjela 
bridge, near Jablanica, southern Bosnia-Herzegovina. The former 
Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina has been ravaged by the 
civil war between local Moslems, Serbs and Croats for the past 
21 months. Gen. Briquemont said if the bridge was repaired this 
would facilitate the passage of humanitarian convoys from the 
Croat-controlled territories in western Bosnia through central 
Bosnia on their way to Sarajevo. The general said it was quite 
obvious that the Bosnian Croat Army (HVO) had no wish to help 
open the Mostar-Jablanica route. 
  Gen. Briquemont steps down as the U.N. forces commander for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina next week, after criticizing the U.N. policy 
in this former Yugoslav republic.

  [Text] The Bosnia-Herzegovina Constitutional Court has 
decided at today's session to revoke the declaration issued in 
Livno on 24 August 1993 on the formation of the so-called 
Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna. The Constitutional Court 
believes that this decision is not in accordance with the 
Constitution of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as -- in an 
unconstitutional way -- it represents an attempt to create on a 
part of the state territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina a new form of 
social-political community with the basic symbols of a state and 
legal entity. This violates in the strongest of ways the 
constitutional organization, the sovereignty, the unity, and the 
inviolability of the territory of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as an internationally recognized country. 
This is issued in a statement by the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Constitutional Court.

care of for a long time and we do not know how we are still 
managing to help them survive, but the fact that the local 
population of Travnik is also hungry and that they need 
humanitarian aid just as the refugees do should [word

local population are getting food mainly in soup kitchens where 
food reserves are only sufficient for a few days. [passage

Airport near Tuzla was completely upgraded so as to be able to 
receive even the largest of aircraft, but nothing has happened, 
and the world community is still giving in to chetnik threats 
that they will shell it continuously with heavy artillery if it 
is opened. So politics is still what is preventing the lifting 
of the 10-month-long blockade of Tuzla and this region, even in 
this way. This is what Selim Beslagic, Tuzla city mayor, says: 
  [Beslagic] The military officials of UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] have visited the airport in the presence of a U.S. 
officer, who said after the visit that they could equip Dubrave 
Airport to receive aircraft within two and a half hours. This 
means that international experts believe that Dubrave Airport 
can under these conditions and without [word indistinct] 
elements receive these (aircraft). I think that the airport is 
in the hands of politics, primarily in the hands of the 
blackmailing policy of the fascist aggressor -- when I say 
fascist, I mean the Serb-Montenegrin bandits -- and it seems to 
me that NATO, Europe, and the United Nations must bare their 
teeth and finally show whether they are for or against fascism. 
If they are for fascism, they will not open the airport. If 
they are against fascism, I think that the airport will be 
opened. I personally hope that it (will be the latter). 
  [Brkic] This winter some 635,000 people in this region have 
been living a nightmare when it comes to the delivery of food 
and survival. Mr. Beslagic, what would the opening of this 
airport mean? 
  [Beslagic] The opening of Dubrave Airport has two functions. 
The first one, I believe, is psychological, to lift the 
blockade, the psychological blockade, as we are simply blocked 
here and if aircraft [words indistinct], it would mean that 
there is a way out. The second is humanitarian, which again 
[words indistinct] the delivery of food, a regular flow of food, 
and I can tell you immediately that [words indistinct] and part 
of the European blackmail. 
  [Brkic] Over the last few days the world has been saying 
that this airport near Tuzla will after all be opened. It 
remains to be seen whether this is just another game.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic </F>
by Snjezan Lalovic in Pale on 20 January -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Mladic] I and my associates have held talks with 
Generals Cot and Briquemont and their associates. We discussed 
various issues of interest to peace and the more normal and 
regular functioning of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] 
mission in this region. I expect that General Briquemont's 
contribution to all this will be continued, that this positive 
trend will continue, and that a peaceful solution in this region 
will be found. 
  [Lalovic] We asked General Mladic to comment on the latest 
Geneva talks. 
  [Mladic] It is not at all up to me to comment on them. We 
knew that they [the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government side] would 
not sign. I am convinced that they will not sign next time 
either. War suits them, as the forces that started the war, 
they came for war, and while they are here there will be no 
peace. They have decided to continue the war for as long as 
they have the men and the international support. Since they do 
not lack the latter, and -- despite great losses in the former 
-- they will continue the war because those who pushed them into 
war, their sponsors, will not let them stop the war as they have 
not achieved their aims. They never did care about Muslim 
lives, so Alija Izetbegovic will probably [pauses] He is OK. 
He is not being killed; his supporters are getting killed, 
those who have been blinded by him. 
  [Lalovic] This is what General Mladic told us about 
Izetbegovic's visit to NATO headquarters in Brussels. 
  [Mladic] He must have gone there to hand in his report 
[laughs] and to beg for some aid. 
  [Lalovic] The talks with generals Cot and Briquemont also 
concerned the possibility of the withdrawal of UNPROFOR from 
this region. 
  [Mladic] We discussed the replacement of the Canadian units 
in Srebrenica, but nothing else in that field. 
  [Lalovic] The reporters present only had a chance to speak 
to General Cot in passing. He briefly said that he was in a 
hurry to meet [new UNPROFOR commander] General Rose, and that he 
did not have anything of importance to say prior to his 
departure as UNPROFOR commander for the former Yugoslavia.

  [Text] Geneva, 19 Jan (TANJUG) -- The Geneva peace 
conference has got its evolution and its continuity and cannot 
forever return to the beginning, Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic said in his address today to the participants of a 
plenary session devoted to negotiations in Bosnia. 
  The Serbian side has assumed a serious and responsible 
approach to the European Union [EU] demands because it deemed 
that the EU has defined its proposition in a serious and 
responsible way, Milosevic added. 
  He recalled that the EU demands were precisely set out: 33.3 
percent of the territory for the Muslim republic, temporary UN 
administration of Sarajevo, EU administration of Mostar, and 
access to the Sava river for the Muslim republic. 
  The Serbian side came to Geneva to sign the peace plan 
because it has accepted the EU proposal, the Serbian president 
said, adding that a plan perfect to the smallest detail has 
never existed; the remaining issues can be successfully resolved 
in bilateral relations after the peace agreement has been 
reached. 
  Slobodan Milosevic added that he reasons along the lines of 
the logical view that acceptance of the EU proposal creates 
conditions for the peace plan to be signed and for ending the 
war. He stressed that the remaining critical points and 
alterations to the plan can be no one's reason for continuing 
the war and that a peace should be endorsed immediately, while 
any possible exchanges should be left to negotiations between 
the parties involved. 
  The Serbian president said that the international community 
has an obligation to explain to the Muslim side its attitude to 
its proposal in the event of the Muslim side refusing to sign a 
peace in the circumstances surrounding the acceptance of the EU 
proposals. At the same time the European Twelve ought -- in 
keeping with their obligations -- to lift the sanctions against 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Serbian people. The 
Serbian president said in conclusion that this is the 
international community's moral obligation. 
  Sources close to the negotiators say that the plenary 
session 
was held in a depressing atmosphere against the backdrop of 
mutual recriminations between the Muslim and Croatian 
delegations. The Muslim army side is reported to have tabled 
new territorial demands with the Croats. 
  The second plenary session is expected to begin this 
afternoon. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia have 
resumed their bilateral talks following the signing of their 
joint declaration. President Slobodan Milosevic and President of 
the Serbian Republic Radovan Karadzic have also talked to 
Co-chairmen Owen and Stoltenberg. Sources close to the Croatian 
delegation claim that Tudjman suggested to Bosnian Muslim Leader 
Izetbegovic that an arbitration commission be set up which would 
resolve territorial disputes between all three warring sides in 
the whole of Bosnia- Herzegovina. It has been unofficially 
learned that Lord Owen has proposed that the UN Security Council 
should set up a commission and that a cease-fire should be in 
effect while the commission is working. Sources close to the 
delegation of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina say 
that the Serbian side has rejected such a commission. 
  According to the latest indications, the current round of 
peace negotiations on Bosnia is expected to wrap up tonight.

<F P=106> [Ivan Lamper article: "Skoda Plzen Denies Arms Contacts </F>
With the Iranian Regime; the Documents State Otherwise"] 
  [Text] On Monday 10 January a strange denial was published 
in MLADA FRONTA DNES: "It is out of the question that Skoda 
Plzen would want to offer Iran the modernized version of the 
T-72 tank." This statement was issued to the press by Skoda 
Plzen Spokesman Jaroslav Hudec. According to him, he wanted to 
curb "speculation by some of the media about the visit to Iran 
by the Skoda director." Until Hudec's statement, however, there 
had been no trace of suspicion in any Czech or foreign newspaper 
that Skoda Director General Lubomir Soudek had offered tanks to 
Tehran. Until now, his trip to Iran has been marked by a 
completely different scandal: A willingness to supply the regime 
with technology for its nuclear program. Why did Spokesman 
Hudec decide to deny "speculation" that has so far not occurred 
to anyone? 
<H5>  The Deputy Minister and the General </H5>
  The answer is simple. On Friday 7 January RESPEKT asked 
Director General Soudek the following question: "During your 
visit to Iran at the end of last November, did you hold talks 
with representatives from the Iranian Defense Ministry and 
military experts"? As Soudek was unable to reply -- apparently, 
he was too busy -- Jaroslav Hudec dealt with the matter: "I am 
authorized to state on behalf of the director that, while he was 
in Tehran, he did not hold talks with any of the people you 
mention." Three days later, the aforementioned denial was 
issued. Although no specific arms were mentioned in the RESPEKT 
question, Hudec thought it necessary to deny in advance talks 
about T-72 tanks. 
  The two negative statements issued by Spokesman Hudec are, 
of 
course, at variance with the document RESPEKT has managed to 
obtain. This is an internal memorandum from the trip to Iran 
prepared for select trading partners of Skoda Plzen after the 
delegation's return home. The following two notes are contained 
in the comprehensive text: 
  A Meeting at the Defense Ministry. 
  Present on the Iranian side: Deputy Minister Vaheed and five 
  members of his staff; the deputy foreign minister. 
  We briefed them on the RDP Group and its possibilities. We 
  gave them a rough outline, prepared by the RDP Group, of the 
  options for supplying our hardware . 
  Interest in: 
  -- the new generation of surface-to-air missiles 
  -- Tamara 
  -- the modernization of tanks. 
  Talks With the Army. 
  Present: General Rahimi, deputy head of tank production. 
  The general is an expert on tanks. It was recommended to: 
  -- send him a list of RDP Group shareholders and their 
military 
  production program (responsible: Engineer Vlcek, deadline 31 
  December 1993) 
  -- invite representatives from the Iranian Army to a 
  demonstration of the T-72 and other weapons innovations 
  (responsible: Engineer Vlcek, deadline 2/94). 
  On the basis of a demonstration of the hardware, it is 
possible 
  to conclude an agreement on the purchase of weapons or on 
  cooperation in the production of weapons systems in 
components. 
<H5>  The Risk: An Unnecessary Fuss in Advance </H5>
  Jan Vlcek, the director general of the Czech RDP Group arms 
consortium, knows nothing about a list of shareholders or about 
inviting Iranian experts, which he is supposed to arrange. "I 
have not heard anything about this," he says. "We respect the 
law and Czech foreign policy." Like Jaroslav Hudec, he also 
describes all the reports about talks between Soudek's team and 
Iranian military officials as "mere deduction and speculation." 
  Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy is more cautious 
in his judgment. In reply to a written question on whether he 
had been informed of Soudek's talks at the Defense Ministry in 
Tehran-- either before the visit or after it -- he said: "I am 
only given a brief outline of Mr. Soudek's plans during his 
foreign visits. I was not informed in advance of any specific 
contacts in Iran. I was briefed on his talks only after the 
visit was over." 
  And the second question was -- what do you think of them? 
  "During all of these negotiations, the RDP Group management 
exposes itself to the substantial risk that the activities that 
attract unnecessary attention in advance will come up against a 
stumbling block -- that the government will not grant a license 
for the anticipated exports." 
  There is a slight slip here: In the Czech Republic today it 
is Vladimir Dlouhy's own office and not the government that 
grants licenses for military contracts. According to a cabinet 
resolution of May 1993, it must -- at the same time -- be guided 
by the point of view of the Foreign Ministry. It, according to 
its spokeswoman, Lucie Pilipova, only considers trade with 
countries under the UN Security Council's embargo to be 
unequivocally prohibited. Despite this, the Cernin Palace 
apparently also "carefully analyzes" all other requests to 
export arms and, after weighing up the situation, gives its 
consent or rejects them. Would the Foreign Ministry now permit 
the export of tanks and missiles to Iran? "It is impossible to 
give an unequivocal answer to such a hypothetical question that 
does not concern a specific application for a license," said 
Pilipova. "I think, however, that, after taking into 
consideration all the circumstances, our office would be 
inclined to the view not to permit such exports." 

<H5>    An Element of Human Culture </H5>
  Jaroslav Hudec has prepared a little show piece for 
reporters 
in connection with the discussion on arms production at Skoda 
Plzen: A copy of the technical design for a saber -- "until 
now, our last arms order" -- that Skoda produced 300 of 10 years 
ago for the Castle Guard. "Nevertheless, I would like to 
emphasize one thing," says Mr. Hudec apropos the drawing. "Arms 
production is an element of human culture. It is a fact of life 
and we are realists. We are not ashamed of wanting to 
manufacture special technology. Unfortunately, however, we have 
found ourselves on the defensive." 
  It is, of course, hard to determine the true extent of this 
"defensive." Skoda Plzen is one of the 40 shareholders in the 
RDP Group arms consortium and, within its framework, it 
coordinates the program for modernizing the Soviet T-72 tank. 
"It should be a truly quality tank," said Lubomir Soudek in 
LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE on 29 September last year. "We will modernize 
it right on the spot based on verified documentation from 
Western firms and tried-and-tested engines. I believe there 
will be a great deal of interest in it. In the near future, I 
will hold talks with the ministers of national defense of 
certain states outside Europe. We have to agree on some 
deliveries." 
  Now the Skoda spokesman "on behalf of Mr. Soudek" is casting 
doubt on some of the statements made by his director. In 
particular, it is -- apparently -- out of the question that our 
arms producers could agree with anyone on supplies of the T-72 
"in the near future." The entire modernization process is -- 
regardless of the verified documentation and the 
tried-and-tested engines -- in its infancy. The company has 
only just hired an expert to determine the course of the 
project, to prepare the budget, calculations, and so on. 
Apparently, no one has any details at the moment and nothing 
will be clear for about two years. The situation is the same 
with regard to another of the statements quoted -- 
"modernization on the spot." "So far, we do not know how the 
tank's modernization will proceed," Hudec told RESPEKT. "Mr. 
Soudek's statement was merely an entrepreneurial idea that has 
not yet acquired firm contours." 
  Untrue again, at least as far as Jan Vlcek, the head of the 
RDP Group, is concerned. For him it is a fait accompli: 
"Country X will simply place an order for the modernization of 
its tanks and we will go there and carry out the work locally. 
The state where we will carry out the modernization has to be 
-- naturally -- approved by the government." 
  There is a problem here, however. Today, there are very few 
countries X that have the "T-72" and that, at the same time, 
would meet our conditions for arms exports. The only logical 
customer would be our army. However, the RDP Group management 
itself admits that, so far, it has not managed to conclude a 
contract with it. Therefore, if Vlcek's company wants to adhere 
to our state's political line in its business dealings, its 
stake on the T-72 looks like an inexplicable risk: The markets 
that would be interested are embargoed and those to which the 
tank may be exported do not want the product. 
  According to rival experts from this branch, the answer to 
the riddle lies in the phrase "modernization on the spot." 
Instead of provocative and largely unsuccessful attempts to 
"smuggle" assembled weapons to terrorist countries, this method 
provides scope for more dignified camouflage: Only parts of 
these weapons, licenses, and the appropriate know-how can be 
exported. 
<H5>  Until the Bear Starts Waving His Arms </H5>
  Of course, tanks and missiles were not the only hot items 
discussed by the Czech businessmen during their visit to Tehran. 
Apart from General Rahimi and Deputy Minister Vaheed (the former 
head of the Iranian intelligence service), the Skoda Plzen 
director also visited Reza Amrollahi from the Iranian Atomic 
Commission. A well-known scandal erupted around these talks 
immediately after the return of Soudek's delegation. 
  "The Iranian regime is trying to turn Prague into a 
purchasing center for technology, know-how, and materials that 
would be denied it elsewhere in the world," wrote the Israeli 
newspaper HA'ARETZ on 5 December and thus provoked an outcry in 
the domestic and foreign media. The most severe reaction came 
from North America. "According to the U.S. strategic doctrine, 
it is necessary to ward off the risk that Iran will produce a 
nuclear weapon. Germany, after it got its fingers burnt in Iraq 
and Libya, banned the export of nuclear technology to terrorist 
states, but people from executive power are trying to get round 
this ban. And the hungry Czechs want to sell to anyone," wrote 
THE NEW YORK TIMES three days before the end of the year. The 
article ended unequivocally: "If Prague sees its future as a 
merchant of death, it should be told that it cannot bank on 
membership in NATO. If the Russian bear again begins to wave 
his arms, whom would the Czechs want to guarantee their 
security? Will it turn to its nuclear customers in Tehran?" 
  The domestic press mostly limited itself to quoting the 
official statements issued by Skoda Plzen. It admitted that 
negotiations were held on supplying a reactor to Iran, but it 
denied that it acted as an intermediary for Siemens or 
Westinghouse. The mass media, the Skoda Plzen spokesman, and 
some government ministers then repeated several times that 
Skoda's offer concerns "peaceful technology," which can in no 
way be used for the production of nuclear weapons. This 
argument was used recently by MLADA FRONTA DNES on 10 January: 
"To be slightly cynical, selling the Iranians a reactor just 
means a good deal to the tune of tens of millions of korunas. 
It would be hard for the company's management to explain to its 
shareholders that they had left such an opportunity to the 
competition." 

<H5>    The Road to Prosperity </H5>
  The uproar over the nuclear reactor is the second time 
recently that the world has tried to scuttle Czech-Iranian 
nuclear cooperation. In June 1993 the secretary at the U.S. 
Embassy in Prague asked the Foreign Ministry to suspend the 
contract to supply technology for extracting and processing 
uranium ore concluded between the Prague company Geoindustria 
GMS and the Iranian Atomic Commission. The Czech side replied 
that it was impossible to turn down the deal because it involved 
"peaceful equipment," but in the end -- apparently, thanks to 
voluntary cooperation from the exporter -- the export deal fell 
through. Last year the GMS company even terminated its work on 
a geological survey of the uranium deposits in the Anarak and 
Bandar Abbas regions in Iran. 
  Skoda Plzen, of course, refuses to make similar concessions 
in the nuclear business. The pressure to terminate the contract 
is, according to it, merely an "unfair move by the competition." 
The question of who this competition is remains unanswered. In 
democratic countries today there is no risk of being lost in the 
crush over orders for the Iranian nuclear program. The Federal 
Government (under pressure from the United States) prohibited 
Siemens from undertaking nuclear activity in Iran several years 
ago and the French Framatome company and -- of course -- the 
U.S. Westinghouse company cannot export there either. Skoda has 
also been criticized in the foreign press not for reasons of 
"competition," but on the contrary, because -- as an alleged 
intermediary -- it enables these companies to conduct prohibited 
business deals. 
  At the moment, Iran has a contract with Russia to construct 
a 
nuclear power plant (the VVER [water-moderated water-cooled 
power reactor] type). Russia is also apparently considering 
whether to complete the half-built (and partly bombed) power 
plant in Bushehr that had to be abandoned by Siemens. According 
to Skoda Deputy Director Frantisek Svitak, the Plzen company is 
interested in participating in -- to say the least -- the first 
order as a general supplier via Russia. The point of view of 
the experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency is 
unequivocal: A project of this size will give the Iranians 
considerable experience in reactor engineering and operations. 
It will be essential to train local experts and to permit the 
operation of test reactors that, in the long-term perspective, 
will support the state's nuclear program. Moreover, if Tehran 
obtains the VVER reactor, this will provide it with enough of an 
excuse to submit orders for more nuclear technology. 
  The equally unequivocal point of view of Skoda's senior 
management stands in opposition to all of this. Spokesman 
Jaroslav Hudec formulated it as follows in the December issue of 
the enterprise's magazine SKODOVAK: "Whether people like it or 
not, our enterprise will not allow itself to be dictated to by 
anyone who feels entitled to do so. We have our own way of 
thinking and our own plans for achieving prosperity."

fighters, whose average age is about 25. Radzo also stressed 
the excellent cooperation with the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 
particularly in fighting crime. The fighters of the military 
police battalion are also involved in combat operations together 
with the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. 
  Speaking about the latest round of the Geneva talks, Dr. 
Ganic stressed that the Serbian-Croatian coalition from 
Karadjordjevo [location of Milosevic-Tudjman talks in 1991 on 
the carve-up of Bosnia-Herzegovina] was again at work. 
  [Ganic] However, we will continue to fight. We will wait 
for the convention of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats, wait to 
hear their views on the [word indistinct] that they will support 
a unified Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that they will not support 
this Karadjordjevo concept. [words indistinct] some other 
coalitions are possible, coalitions that no one has ever under 
any circumstances envisaged. 
  [Muhic] Addressing the partition of the country, the 
carve-up of Bosnia between Serbia and Croatia, Ganic said: 
  [Ganic] Tudjman and Milosevic cannot carve up Bosnia. They 
cannot even with the help of some circles in Europe, because 
that would extend the Bosnia-Herzegovina war into new regions. 
No one has ever counted on that. You have heard that we have 
been offered Peljesac, that is, a part of Peljesac to build a 
port, so [we have been offered] a part of another country, 
somebody else's territory. I would like to remind you that we 
have built one port on somebody else's territory, the port of 
Ploce. Now they want us to build another one. Why should we 
[word indistinct], when we have our own coast [in and around 
Neum], and we can build the port there, on the territory over 
which we have sovereignty, and that is some 24 kilometers of 
coast. 
  [Muhic] The international community during the Geneva talks 
has abandoned the principles set at the London conference, Ganic 
stressed. 
  [Ganic] We have to return to them. Whether by the Security 
Council or some other [word indistinct] conference, a Balkan one 
or a London one, whatever, the principles have to be set again 
and then, based on those principles, we can search for a 
political solution. 
  [Muhic] Some of the solutions have to be found in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina itself, Ganic said. First of all we have to 
bolster the army. There are still reserves, both in the 
internal organization of the military and civilian authorities, 
and in involving our people abroad. Just the things that we 
have done inside Bosnia-Herzegovina have yielded results. What, 
in the view of Presidency member Ejup Ganic, is needed for the 
war to be ended? 
  [Ganic] It will be over when both Serbia and Croatia 
understand that they cannot carve up Bosnia, that they cannot 
carve up Bosnia in the way set out in Karadjordjevo. They 
cannot restrict the Bosniak people to a few enclaves in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Muhic] At the end of his visit to the military police 
battalion, Dr. Ejup Ganic said: 
  [Ganic] We here are defending certain values that do not 
belong to Bosnia-Herzegovina alone, but to all civilization. 
Because of that, our fighters make one of the best armies ever 
formed in Europe. 
  [Muhic] Dzevad Radzo, commander of the military police 
battalion, expressed his gratitude to Presidency member Ejup 
Ganic for the information, and concluded that the military 
police -- regardless of the political solutions -- will carry 
out its tasks for as along as needed.

  [Text] Tirana, January 14 (ATA) -- In its press release of 
January 10, the Socialist Party [SP] accused ATA of having 
raised an almost complete blockade for the opposition forces. 
  Regarding this statement, ATA reporters asked explanations 
from the vice chairman of the SP, Servet Pellumbi, and Deputy 
Bashkim Zeneli, who repeated they support the conclusion they 
have declared. But, according to them, the blockade of the 
information has been more evident in other mass media than the 
ATA. 
  Asked for concrete facts related to their conclusion, the SP 
officials mentioned only two cases, that of the rally in Kucove 
and the case when some people in Shkoder didn't allow some 
deputies of the SP to have a rally they had previously 
announced, both events have taken place 7-8 months ago. 
  For these two cases, since its correspondents have not been 
present in the spot for lack of transportation means, ATA has 
made the report referring to the spokesman of the Ministry of 
Public Order, since incidents took place in these events. 
  Mr. Pellumbi and Mr. Zeneli admitted that reports of the SP 
sent to ATA have been few. According to them, the SP spokesman 
has not known the practice of sending reports to main mass media 
and secondly, in some cases, proceeding from the former practice 
of not giving reports, it has been prejudiced that these 
institutions have made a continuous blockade to reports. 
  For further explanations about their claims regarding the 
ATA, Mr. Pellumbi and Mr. Zeneli said they will discuss about it 
the next day.

about the opposition parties in Albania. The SP statement was

  However, Mr. Zeneli subsequently informed our reporter that 
the SP had not yet marshalled the data to substantiate their 
charges. Several days have now passed without further word from 
the SP.

  [Text] Tirana, January 15 (ATA) -- The commission of 
socialist intelligentsia sponsored a meeting January 14 at which 
reporters from the Radio-TV, the ALBANIAN TELEGRAPHIC AGENCY 
[ATA] and other representatives of the mass media exchanged 
opinions on professional and ethical aspects of journalism. The 
discussion aimed at avoiding banalities and politicization in 
the media. 
  Ilir Zhilla, director of ATA, stressed that ATA is a great 
national asset for the mass media and called on all press organs 
to use information available from ATA (some 3,000 items of world 
news a day) and information provided by ATA's district 
correspondents. 
  Mr. Zhilla asked his colleagues to respect each other and 
the 
organizations for which they work. He said that reporters 
should avoid hostile polemics and declared that the Albanian 
news media should maintain constructive policies in order to 
encourage the people and the political leadership in overcoming 
the difficulties of the transition period. Mr. Zhilla also 
sternly criticized irresponsibility and damage to the national 
interest on the part of the press.

  [Excerpts] Tirana, January 15 (ATA) -- On January 14 
before noon, Albanian President Sali Berisha received the 
special envoy of the U.S. President Clinton, Madeleine Albright, 
U.S. ambassador in the UN Security Council and member of the 
cabinet of President Clinton, the Albanian President's Press and 
Information Office reports. Ms. Albright was accompanied by 
high ranking officials of the National Security Council of the 
State and Defence Departments. [passage omitted] 
  President Berisha stressed that Albania is grateful to the 
U.S. for the support that the U.S. Government, institutions and 
citizens have given to Albania during this period of time. "We 
consider the cooperation with the U.S.A. as very important not 
only for the historic relations and the fact that this country 
is a main pillar of the freedom and democracy in the world, but 
also because we consider the U.S. presence as vital for peace 
and stability in our continent, that is not only for the 
Albanians but for all the others." 
  President Berisha expressed his approval to sign the 
Partnership For Peace, stressing that he considered it as a 
stage of active integration of Albania into the Atlantic 
Alliance. "But we shall insist on becoming a NATO member," he 
said. 
  "The creation of the enterprise fund in Albania is a very 
good news for the Albanians and it will be a powerful support 
for the reform in our country," Mr. Berisha said. He called for 
acceleration of procedures for the approval of the bilateral 
investments treaty. Mr. Berisha expressed Albanian's resolution 
to observe sanctions against Serbia despite the damage it causes 
to the Albanian economy. "Any toleration in the embargo would 
be a support for the militarist policy of Milosevic," he said. 
Mr. Berisha demanded on the basis of the UN Charter 
compensation for the losses caused to the Albanian economy by 
the embargo regime. 
  President Berisha pointed out as of great importance for 
peace the definition by President Bush and President Clinton in 
regard to Kosova, as a red line for the Serbian aggression. A 
special role in this direction has been played by the U.S. 
troops in Macedonia and the U.S. insistence in the observation 
of the UN sanctions against Serbia. Expressing his thanks to 
Ms. Albright for her role in the Security Council, for the 
resolution which imposed the embargo against Serbia and the call 
for the return of the CSCE observers to Kosova, President 
Berisha stressed that acceptance of the UN observers in Kosova 
is indispensable. He asked that the lifting of the embargo 
should be also conditioned with the resolution of the question 
of Kosova. "The question of the Albanians in the Balkans is a 
key to stability of the peninsula," he said. "The embargo is at 
present the only means to force such solutions." President 
Berisha discussed with U.S. officials cooperation in the 
military field, expressing his will for further promotion in 
this aspect. He also called for the support of the U.S. 
Government in regard to solution of the problem of Albania's 
foreign debt and other projects. 
  President Berisha conveyed his cordial wishes for President 
Clinton and the Deputy President Gore and expressed his desire 
to welcome them to Albania. 
  During the talks, they also dwelt on other bilateral 
questions and the situation in the region.

<F P=106> ["Interior Minister Describes Situation as `Critical' in the </F>
Wake of Two Commandos' Killing" -- BTA headline] 
  [Text] Sofia, January 18 (BTA) -- "All senior employees of 
the Interior Ministry will meet this afternoon to consider 
specific measures for our further work with a view to overcoming 
the critical situation," said Interior Minister Viktor Mikhaylov 
interviewed on Bulgarian national radio. 
  The situation, which Mr. Mikhaylov described as "critical," 
arose after members of the Riot Police Squad shot and killed two 
counterterrorist commandos ("Red Berets") in an unauthorized 
operation in a Sofia neighbourhood last Friday [14 January] 
night. Assuming full responsibility for the tragic incident, Mr. 
Mikhaylov handed his resignation on Sunday [16 January] but the 
cabinet unanimously rejected it by secret ballot yesterday. 
  Mr. Mikhaylov said that this "tremendous gaffe committed by 
the members of the Riot Police Squad," paralyzed the Interior 
Ministry services. "We must do something to help them get over 
this shock. I think we have got enough people who can get things 
out of this shock situation," the minister told his interviewer. 
  Mr. Mikhaylov said that the Riot Police Squad will be 
reorganized and may be replaced by two other units with 
different functions. "We will probably consider a shift of 
control over stand-by units," the minister said in his interview. 
  Before the passage of the Judiciary Act, there is no method 
by which the crime control institutions could work like a single 
mechanism fighting crime, in his view. Mr. Mikhaylov said that 
Mr. Nikolay Slatinski MP, chairman of the National Assembly 
Committee on National Security, with whom he conferred today, 
promised him cooperation in this direction. 
  Cooperation among the state institutions in crime control 
was 
high on the agenda of the meeting today between senior members 
of the National Assembly Committee on National Security and the 
Ministry of the Interior. 
  Crime in Bulgaria has reached a level which jeopardizes the 
very integrity of the state, Mr. Slatinski said after the 
meeting. The Interior Ministry officers cannot cope with the 
situation on their own because it involves a struggle for 
dominance between major economic groups. According to Mr. 
Slatinski, it is not a separate force or institution that should 
tackle this problem but all competent institutions should agree 
on cooperation. 
  "It is a pity that things had to get that far before my 
colleagues could realize why our committee was pressing so 
urgently to prioritize national security legislation," Mr. 
Slatinski said. Asked whether organized crime groups may already 
have a lobby even in parliament, Mr. Slatinski answered that he 
would not commit himself to such an assertion which is insulting 
to his fellow MP's. Still, the stalling of laws concerning 
national security made him suspect some connection between 
economic groups and politicians.

  [Excerpt] Sofia, January 17 (BTA) -- We ascertained that 
both Bulgaria and Sweden have a positive attitude to NATO's 
Partnership For Peace (PFP) initiative. We decided to 
informother of our actions under the said initiative, Mr. Anders 
Bjorck, defense minister of the Kingdom of Sweden, who is on a 
formal visit to Bulgaria at the head of a military delegation, 
said today after a meeting with his Bulgarian opposite number 
Valentin Aleksandrov. Mr. Bjorck added the sides also debated 
the situation in Europe, including Russia, and other matters of 
bilateral concern. We agreed to keep in touch on a number of 
issues of common interest and more specifically in the military 
sphere, between the two Defense Ministry, the Swedish defense 
minister added. 
  The sides also debated the UN-sponsored peace initiatives. 
Over 60 thousand Swedish officers and soldiers have taken part 
in them, Mr. Bjorck specified. I extended an invitation to Mr. 
Aleksandrov on a group of Bulgarian military to be trained in 
courses by military instructors who took part in UN missions, 
conducted in a special school near Stockholm, Mr. Bjorck added. 
  As concerns the PFP, we have no political differences, 
Minister Valentin Aleksandrov said after his meeting with the 
Swedish defense minister. The differences concern technologies 
and standardization, he added. "We were a neutral state," the 
Bulgarian defense minister quoted his Swedish counterpart. This 
statement makes me think that our decision to join the PFP is 
useful for Bulgaria, Mr. Aleksandrov said. 
  Mr. Bjorck is visiting Bulgaria on Sweden's "very insistent" 
initiative, the Bulgarian defense minister underscored. Our 
cooperation may encompass peace-keeping operations and the 
training of related contingents. Sweden helped us with 
expertise in the training of a Bulgarian infantry batallion to 
operate within UNTAC, the minister recalled. The invitation to 
dispatch a team of Bulgarian officers to the specialized school 
near Stockholm is very important. Working groups are to 
consider possible defense industry joint ventures, he indicated. 
The Swedish Army is being thoroughly re-armed. I think we can 
be of use in the field of electrical engineering and possibly in 
anti-tank defense, Mr. Aleksandrov said. In his view, 
territorial defence cooperation is likewise possible. 
  Mr. Anders Bjorck is the first Swedish defense minister to 
have visited Bulgaria. He has already been in this country as 
President of the Council of Europe and in his words, he has had 
very good personal contacts, including with President Zhelev. 
Mr. Bjorck told reporters he would use his meetings to get an 
idea of how the Bulgarian Armed Forces were developing and 
whether a military reform was under way. 
  Later today, the Swedish military delegation was received by 
Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov. In the course of the talks 
the sides exchanged views on bilateral relations, Daskalov told 
BTA. The sides noted with satisfaction the increased activity on 
both sides to promote cooperation in all spheres, including the 
military, said the Bulgarian foreign minister. We shared views 
on general issues of European integration and the two countries' 
integration into European structures, said Daskalov. They 
discussed developments in former Yugoslavia, the guests were 
briefed on the losses sustained by Bulgaria as a result of the 
Yugoembargo, the minister said. 
  Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev this afternoon received 
Mr. 
Bjorck. The two discussed the situation in Europe, including 
Russia, expressing hope the Partnership for Peace initiative 
would develop into a system and structure of security which 
would guarantee the security of countries such as Bulgaria and 
Sweden. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prague, January 19 (CTK) -- A trade representative 
of the foreign sales company Skodaexport was imprisoned in Iran 
at the end of last year in as yet unclear circumstances, the 
independent daily MLADA FRONTA DNES reports today, citing 
"reliable sources." 
  The paper says its information has been confirmed by the 
head 
of Skodaexport's General Director's Office, Zdenek Sima, and 
Czech Foreign Ministry Spokesman Lucie Pilipova. The Iranian 
authorities imprisoned Vladislav Tyl for several days before 
releasing him. Now back in Prague, he declined to comment on 
his imprisonment. 
  Tyl was imprisoned just after a delegation left the country 
from the Skoda heavy engineering works based in Plzen, west 
Bohemia, which had been creating business contacts in Tehran. 
  Skoda Plzen Director General Lubomir Soudek told MLADA 
FRONTA 
DNES that he did not find out about Tyl's imprisonment until 
last week, and that he did not know the cause of his arrest. 
  Sima said that although the Iranians apologized to Tyl after 
releasing him, they did not explain why they had detained him. 
Sima does not know exactly who detained Tyl. "I do not know 
whether it was the secret service, counter-intelligence, or the 
criminal police. I don't think even Tyl knows," he said.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 18 (CTK) -- The Czech Foreign Ministry 
has neither been informed about Skoda heavy engineering company 
General Director Lubomir Soudek's negotiations in Iran last 
November nor has it been approached by anyone from the Iranian 
side, ministry spokeswoman Lucie Pilipova told CTK today. 
  The latest issue of the Czech political weekly RESPEKT 
reported that during the visit to Iran, the delegation from the 
Plzen, west Bohemia-based Skoda company led by Soudek negotiated 
with the Iranian Defense Ministry and Army representatives on 
the possibility of supplying Iran with weapons and military 
systems. The weekly said that representatives from the Czech 
Foreign Ministry had also been present at the talks. 
  Pilipova declined to comment on the published article or on 
other reports on the topic that have appeared in the Czech media 
recently. 
  Neither has a spokesman for the Iranian Embassy in Prague 
commented on the article, citing a statement issued by his 
embassy in December. At that time Iranian Ambassador in Prague 
Rasul Movahedijan distanced himself from the information on his 
country's alleged efforts to obtain nuclear technology from the 
Czech Skoda company. At the same time he spoke in favor of 
closer contacts with the company, emphasizing that this 
cooperation was directed solely towards peaceful projects. 
  Skoda representatives admitted in December that Soudek had 
negotiated on the possible nuclear project -- the construction 
of a nuclear power plant -- during his November visit to 
Teheran, but added that no agreement was concluded. 
  Israeli Ambassador to the Czech Republic Moshe Yegar, in an 
interview with CTK in December, voiced the view that any 
supplies for nuclear energy projects to Iran were 
extraordinarily dangerous and voiced doubts about Iran's 
sincerity in connection with the presentation of its nuclear 
program as solely peaceful one. 
  RESPEKT wrote that during the November talks with Skoda 
representatives, not only were supplies for nuclear energy 
projects discussed, but Iran also showed interest in Czech 
supplies of "special technology" -- ground-to-air missiles, 
modernized T-72 tanks, and the Tamara detection system, which 
can track aircraft equipped with special anti-radar devices.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 19 (CTK) -- Pavel Tigrid is to be new 
Czech culture minister to replace Jindrich Kabat, who resigned 
on Monday [17 January], Jan Kasal (KDU-CSL), deputy chairman of 
the Czech Parliament's Chamber of Deputies, told CTK today. 
Kabat is a KDU-CSL member while Tigrid is without party 
affiliation. 
  Tigrid, 77, lived in exile after the communist coup of 
February 1948. For 35 years he was editor-in-chief of the 
quarterly SVEDECTVI (TESTIMONY) published in Paris. After the 
fall of communism in Czechoslovakia in late 1989, he returned to 
Czechoslovakia and became adviser to Vaclav Havel, who was then 
Czechoslovak president.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 18 (CTK) -- The Czech state budget 
recorded a 1.1 billion korunas ($36 million) surplus for 1993, 
Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik told journalists today. Revenues 
totalled 358 billion ($11.93 billion) and expenditures 356.9 
billion ($11.89 billion) Czech korunas, Kocarnik reported. 
  He noted that some minor modification in the figures could 
occur by January 21, but the surplus balance of the budget would 
not change, Kocarnik added. 
  The budget includes a surplus on the clearing account with 
Slovakia amounting to 4.6 billion Czech korunas ($15 million). 
"This means that the final state budget would be higher by this 
sum," Kocarnik said. 
  "In view of the implementation of the new taxation system I 
assess the result as unequivocally successful, as another 
successful transformation step which positively contributed to 
the entire stability of prices, and had an anti-inflationary 
effect," Kocarnik stressed.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 14 (CTK) -- The articles on appointment 
of LIDOVE NOVINY editors, included in the agreement on the 
position of editor-in-chief, violate the law and were therefore 
never valid. Therefore, it is not true that the agreement was 
violated by the adoption of the new internal rules and 
procedures, Josef Kotrba informed CTK today. 
  Kotrba, chairman of the Board of the LIDOVE NOVINY joint 
stock company, was reacting to a series of declarations by 
Jaromir Stetina, who resigned as LN editor-in-chief on Wednesday 
[12 January]. He said that the new internal rules and 
procedures, accepted by the LN Board of Directors recently, 
violated two essential documents -- the editorial statute and 
the agreement on the editor-in-chief -- which guarantee the 
independence of the paper. 
  According to the new rules, the top editors of the staff are 
not appointed by the editor-in-chief, but by the director of the 
company, and the editor-in-chief is not subordinate to the 
Board, but to its chairman. 
  Kotrba's declaration said that the Board of Directors, 
composed entirely of the original shareholders of the LN joint 
stock company and the employees, explicitly declared that the 
new rules did not contradict the statute of the editorial staff. 
  LIDOVE NOVINY was founded in 1893 as a liberal daily. Banned 
by the communist regime after it seized power, it started 
reappearing in 1988 as a dissident publication. 
  Last November the Swiss press company Ringier purchased a 
majority stake in the paper, whose circulation is around 100,000 
copies. 
  The declaration also mentioned that the paper's independence 
was not threatened at all since it was guaranteed by an 
editorial board statute which can be only changed by a general 
meeting of the shareholders with a nine-tenths vote.

  [Text] Budapest, 18 January (MTI) -- Russia is prepared to 
deliver S-300 type anti-aircraft missile systems in repayment of 
its $800 million debt to Hungary, Ferenc Toth, head of the 
Hungarian Defence Ministry's Department of Procurement, 
confirmed in the Tuesday [18 January] issue of MAGYAR HIRLAP. 
  The Russian position seems to have modified, he said. When 
Moscow repaid the first half of its debt through the delivery of 
MiG-29 fighters last year, it was still unwilling to sell 
anti-aircraft missile systems to Hungary. S-300 is a long-range 
anti-aircraft missile system with parameters corresponding to 
those of the U.S. Patriots used in the Gulf War, Toth said. 
  Now it is up to the Hungarian Government and Parliament to 
decide whether they accept the Russian offer, he said. 
  Should they accept it, it is not yet clear how many systems 
Hungary would purchase. Nor does the Russian offer mention 
figures, Toth said. He added that the Hungarian Army was not 
thinking in terms of missiles but those of systems that include 
launching pads and other units as well. 
  Reacting to the information carried in THE WASHINGTON POST 
that the "Visegrad countries (Poland, the Czech Republic, 
Slovakia, and Hungary) have been allowed to purchase US weapons 
and military equipment," Toth said he supposed the U.S. had 
lifted its ban on the sale of "offensive-killing" weapons. This 
category is rather broad and comprises even guns and tanks, the 
Hungarian Defence Ministry official said.

  [Text] Rome, 19 January (MTI) -- Hungary's secret services 
have now been admitted to the "club" of the world's leading 
similar organizations, which before the political change, stood 
opposed to them in several areas, Civilian Intelligence and 
Security Service (Information Office, National Security Office) 
Head Minister Without Portfolio Tibor Fuzessy told MTI in Rome. 
  He arrived on Sunday [16 January] for a visit to Italy, at 
the invitation of the general secretary of the ministerial body 
supervising Italian secret services. 
  "Secret services in today's civilized societies assist in 
the 
battle against crime, terrorism, drug trafficking, arms 
smuggling, and the mafia," Fuzessy said. 
  "Although Central and Eastern European countries freed from 
the former Soviet bloc are a promising ground for all criminal 
rings in East and West, there is no immediate danger at 
present," he said. 
  Fuzessy's discussions in Italy also concerned supervision 
experience, governmental and parliamentary practices of 
licensing the use of secret service means, and controlling it 
through the central budget.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 14 -- Polish President Lech Walesa 
received at the Belvedere on Friday Hungarian Foreign Minister 
Geza Jeszenszky, the presidential press office reported. 
  "I am satisfied that your visit is taking place so soon 
after 
the Prague summit. Europe is now seeking a new vision of its 
future. It is our task to add our concepts to this vision. 
Partnership is real only when we ourselves can settle its 
conditions. The world paid attention to our statements and 
arguments presented before the NATO summit in Brussels and the 
meeting in Prague. Without this pressure on Western public 
opinion we would get much less," the president said. 
  Geza Jeszenszky stressed that it was mainly the Polish 
president who contributed to the positive results of this 
campaign. 
  At the end of the meeting, Walesa said: "After `the Prague 
lesson' we must always remember that we cannot lose influence on 
developments in Eastern and Central Europe. No one will help us 
if we do not do this ourselves. That is why further cooperation 
within the Visegrad group is so significant. We are speaking 
the same language and we have common interests. If we build 
planes for better cooperation, others will join us. In this way 
we will enlarge the area of stability in our region. If we do 
not make use of the chance provided by the "Partnership for 
Peace" we will lose it. "We have to stay on the backs of the 
rich of the world," to present our arguments to them for only 
then facts will change into real security safeguards," the 
president said.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 17 -- First Deputy Defence Minister 
Jerzy Milewski told journalists on Monday that civilian control 
over the armed forces will be preserved despite the planned 
changes in the Polish Defence Ministry. 
  Opinions that the Defence Ministry is ceding its 
prerogatives 
to the general staff are untrue, Milewski declared. 
  He described the planned changes as "corrections in the 
organizational structure" designed to precisely define the tasks 
and improve the work of the Defence Ministry and the general 
staff. 
  According to Milewski the changes are also meant to reduce 
the excessively large administration. 
  Milewski also stressed that it was "indispensable" for the 
civilian Defence Ministry's departments at present to employ the 
military. "There are not so many military experts among 
civilians now," he said.

  [Text] Moscow, Jan. 17 -- Leader of the extreme nationalist 
Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, said 
before his visit to Poland that he and his party are friends of 
the Poles. He also expressed solidarity with the Polish nation, 
the neighbouring and, like Russians, a Slavic nation with whom 
"we have a lot in common and a lot to talk about." [sentence as 
received] 
  Zhirinovskiy, invited to Poland by leader of the National 
Front "samoobrona" (self-defence) Janusz Bryczkowski, said he 
would come to Warsaw for two days in the company of two other 
officials of his party, Mr. Vengerovskiy and Zhebrovskiy. 
  Referring to the common Slavic background of Poles and 
Russians, Zhirinovskiy said: "We have better relations with some 
Atua-Batua islands than with the brotherly Slavic (Polish) 
nation. There must be no misunderstanding or harmful hostility 
between us. We must have a correct image of ourselves and we 
must keep drawing the right conclusions." 
  Zhirinovskiy denied having ever mentioned the acceptability 
of dividing Poland or sharing it between the Russian and German 
spheres of influence. "We are worried about the south but we 
have no problems in the west," he said adding: "We want our 
western borders to remain unchanged." 
  Referring to the borders and to the city of Lvov, 
Zhirinovskiy said that the problem can be solved. "Do the Poles 
want Lvov? No. O.K. I see no problem. What I did say is that 
there are forces in Poland which claim that Lvov is a Polish 
town taken away from its country. But there are many border 
towns such as Trieste or Tyrol which are always disputable. My 
father was born in Lvov in the Russian empire. Lvov later was a 
Polish city. Then it became a Ukrainian and, finally, a Soviet 
city. In which country was my father born? Was it Russia, 
Poland, Ukraine, or the Soviet Union? I do not know but this 
cannot go on like this forever," he stressed. 
  "Stability and clarity must prevail. History is full of 
disputable issues. So let us finish with mutual intimidating 
and digging in history. Time has come to calm down and stop 
creating uncertain and nervous situations," Zhirinovskiy 
emphasized. 
  Janusz Bryczkowski who extended the invitation to 
Zhirinovskiy was on a private visit to Moscow on January 14-17 
where he met with Zhirinovskiy last Saturday. 
  Zhirinovskiy plans to pay an unofficial visit to Poland at 
the end of January.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 16 -- The National-Democratic Party 
(SN-D), headed by Jan Zamoyski, announced on Sunday its plan to 
join the agreement of four right-wing parties, the Real Politics 
Union (UPR), the Conservative Party (PK), Party of Christian 
Democrats (PCHD) and the Peasant-Christian Party (SLCH). 
  But UPR and SN-D leaders, attending a discussion on local 
governments on Sunday, said that they did not intend to form a 
national coalition in the forthcoming local elections. 
  Janusz Korwin Mikke, leader of the UPR, termed as 
"villainous" the recent proposal by the Social Democracy of the 
Republic of Poland (SDRP) to alter the local election law 
several months before expected elections. 
  According to Korwin Mikke, the idea of direct general 
elections for commune heads, town mayors and city presidents is 
an attempt to adjust the election law to the present situation.

  [Excerpt] Bucharest ROMPRES, 19/1/1994 -- The spokesman 
for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Romania, Mircea Geoana, 
read to the press at the 19 January news briefing a statement by 
which the Romanian Foreign Ministry takes note with interest and 
satisfaction of the signing in Moscow by the presidents of the 
United States, the Russian Federation and the Ukraine of the 
documents by which the Ukraine renounces the nuclear strategic 
missiles deployed in its territory. 
  The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs reasserts Romania's 
firm attachment to the aims and principles of non-proliferation 
of nuclear arms and welcomes this important decision made by the 
Ukraine, a decision apt to contribute to strengthening security, 
stability and confidence in our geographical zone, in Europe and 
the whole world. Romania, while duly appreciating the signing 
of the Moscow documents as an important example of nuclear 
disarmament, expresses its hope that other countries holding 
nuclear armament in their possession will take new steps towards 
liquidating their arsenals, the statement concludes. 
  Other subjects mentioned at the news briefing: Scheduled for 
27-28 January 1994 in Rabat, the proceedings of the eighth 
session of the Joint Romanian-Moroccan Intergovernmental 
Commitee for Economic and Technical Cooperation will be chaired 
by the two countries' foreign ministers. This will occasion 
Teodor Melescanu an official visit to Morocco at the invitation 
of state minister in charge with the external affairs and 
cooperation Abdellatif Filali. 
  The two sides will tackle and establish concrete measures 
and 
actions apt to lead to the relaunch of the bilateral political 
dialogue, to boost commercial relations and favour the 
furtherance of economic cooperation in fields of joint interest, 
such as port facilities, road building, drilling, technical 
assistance, professional training. The sides also propose to 
negotiate and sign an agreement to guarantee and promote 
investment, as well as a cooperation protocol between the two 
foreign ministries and the programme reflecting the 1994-1996 
cultural agreement. 
  Friday, 21 January, Foreign Minister Melescanu will have an 
interview with Joseph Kruzel, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of 
defence for European and NATO policies, who is heading the U.S. 
delegation to the meeting of the U.S.-Romania bilateral working 
group on matters regarding political-military cooperation 
relations. 
  Spokesman for the Foreign Ministry Mircea Geoana also told 
the 19 January briefing that the message of Mrs. Madeleine 
Albright, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, special envoy 
of American President Bill Clinton, who paid a visit in Romania 
Saturday, January 15, was considered, alongside recent 
statements by President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, 
to substantially back Romania's efforts to reinforce its 
stability and security in a troubled regional framework and in a 
larger context, in order to consolidate the Romanian democratic 
society. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 17/1/1994 -- Romania's 
Government will direct its efforts simultaneously toward the 
consolidation of its 1993 achievements, new short-term 
objectives and the creation of the conditions required by the 
medium and long-term objectives of the Romanian diplomacy, 
Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu told ROMPRES. 
  The priorities of the Romanian foreign policy, defined 
through the correlation between the national interests and the 
developments in Europe and the world over, include: 
  1. Continuation of efforts for Romania's integration in the 
political, strategic and economic Western-European and 
Euro-Atlantic structures, aiming to consolidate Romania's 
position as factor of stability in the region, in the context of 
the geo-political evolution in the zone. 
  2. Development of bilateral relations with a particular 
stress on the relations with states with long-standing 
democratic traditions and powerful economies, able to support 
the democratization process and reform in Romania. The 
promotion of good neighborly relations, as well as of Romania's 
traditional ties with countries outside Europe. Special stress 
will be set on the development of bilateral relations in the 
economic field. 
  3. Continuation of the special relations with the Republic 
of Moldova aimed at deepening economic integration and the 
consolidation of the cultural and spiritual common space as 
essential premises for accomplishing the natural aspirations of 
all Romanians. 
  4. Further more active participation within the European and 
universal structures, giving special attention to the observance 
of human rights, including the rights of individuals belonging 
to ethnic minorities, rejecting any xenophobe, anti-semite and 
racist approaches. 
  5. Promotion of a policy of close relations with 
international financial bodies, especially with the 
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the European 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development. 
  6. Assertion of the Romanian spirituality in the 
international arena through the elaboration and implementation 
of a widely- covering program to present the national values. 
  7. Strengthening of relations with Romanians living abroad, 
in concordance with constitutional provisions, luring the 
energies of the Romanian diaspora in supporting the reform and 
the democratization of the Romanian society. 
  8. Active participation in international efforts aiming to 
define new concepts and adopt new standards, especially in human 
rights, including the persons belonging to ethnic minorities.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 17/1/1994 -- "Like any other 
country to which the opportunity for strengthened ties with NATO 
has been offered, Romania will do its best to become an active 
partner and to comprehensively meet the requirements that will 
enable the partners for peace to qualify for future membership," 
evinced Teodor Melescanu, minister of state, minister for 
foreign affairs of Romania, in an article with the ORA NOUA 
[NINE O'CLOCK] newspaper. 
  "We are not bothered by the idea that other Central European 
states will do the same. On the contrary. Moreover, we hope 
that the simultaneous endeavors of all the countries in our area 
to increase, in every respect, their compatibility with NATO, 
will trigger a somehow lacking disposition to reproduce -- in 
their mutual relations -- the viable pattern set in Washington, 
45 years ago, by the Alliance. If fulfilled by each of the new 
Central European democracies, the very objectives of the new 
practical programme will lead them in this direction. Likewise, 
to earlier NATO membership. 
  "Both the spirit and the letter of the declaration adopted 
by 
the NATO summit do strongly reconfirm this valuable outlook. 
Its first paragraph underlines that the alliance 'is reaching 
out to establish new patterns of cooperation throughout Europe'. 
The West and the Russian Federation could decisively help the 
alliance in fulfilling this task. Inclusively by overcoming the 
parochial attitudes that have traditionally governed their 
mutual behavior. 
  "This is exactly why, we in Romania find it important -- at 
this historical juncture -- to suggest to our peers in Central 
Europe not to ignore a precious security resource which is 
within our grasp: the establishment and consolidation, 
throughout our area, of good neighborly relations. 
  "I hope the constructive thrust of this proposal will be 
correctly understood by all the countries in our area. The more 
so, because Romania does not embark herself barehanded on the 
historical Euro-Atlantic journey to strengthened European 
stability and security opened by the partnership for peace. Our 
country disposes of certain -- even unique -- geostrategic and 
geopolitical assets. Properly used, they could help the alliance 
in fulfilling its new role of projecting stability and democracy 
beyond its current area, thereby increasing Romania's direct 
contribution to 'lasting peace, stability and well-being in 
Europe'. The significance of those assets is substantially 
enhanced by Romania's belonging to the group of like-minded 
countries which enjoy closer relations with the main Western 
European structures. 
  "In connection with this, I would like to remind to all 
those 
who still think that 'Visegrad membership' is a sine qua non for 
closer relations with the West, that Romania's status with the 
cardinal Western European structures -- the European Union, the 
Western European Union and the Council of Europe -- is identical 
with that enjoyed by the countries in that sub-regional grouping. 
  "This is a most convincing recognition of the fact that, in 
spite of the heavier communist legacy Romania has had to get rid 
of, our political will to irreversibly enshrine the Western 
values and practices in our society, and to solidly anchor the 
country in the Western structures is as genuine as the one 
expressed by 'the Visegrad four'. At the same time, this 
situation clearly indicates that the Western European 
institutions' attitude towards our respective countries is not 
biased by parochial considerations."

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 14/01/1994 -- With regard to the 
affirmation in the Bulgarian DENYAT daily alleging that Romania 
would have moved military units to the border with Bulgaria, the 
Defense Ministry declared: 
  "The Romanian Army has good relations with the Bulgarian 
Army 
in full concordance with the climate of security, friendship, 
understanding and good-neighbourhood between our countries. The 
information published by the daily DENIAT is groundless. No 
movement of troops has taken place along the frontier with 
Bulgaria.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 19/1/1994 -- "The problem of 
Romanians in other countries, including the Romanians living in 
Ukraine and Hungary, is of concern to the Romanian Foreign 
Ministry and it can be settled only in the natural framework of 
human rights, starting from the generally acknowledged measures 
elaborated within the United Nations, CSCE and the Council of 
Europe", said Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu in an 
interview with daily JURNAL NATIONAL. "The Romanian state 
campaigns for the strict observance of the norms of 
international law and of the international standards regarding 
the minorities and makes every effort to secure the rights of 
national minorities in Romania." Teodor Melescanu mentioned 
that "as seen by the Romanian Foreign Ministry, the principle of 
truthfulness and respect of the Romanians living abroad to the 
states whose citizens they are make the keystone of our policy 
with the communities of Romanians everywhere and the way to 
follow in order to avoid any tension and disagreement in 
bilateral relations with other countries". 
  As regards Ukraine, the Romanian chief diplomat opined that 
"the emotional side and the sensitiveness of the situation of 
the Romanian population in that neighbor country consequent to 
the tragic events generated by the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact 
(1939), necessarily require the further taking of steps apt to 
secure conditions for the preservation, expression and 
development of national, linguistic, cultural and religious 
identity of the Romanians". In this respect, Melescanu 
stressed: "We assess as necessary the improvement and 
development of the tuition in Romanian existing in that country, 
the provision of facilities for the training in Romania of 
teaching staff and experts from among Romanian ethnics, the 
granting of assistance in setting up libraries, clubs, 
publishing houses, printing houses for Romanian- language 
publications, the redemption of buildings that belonged to 
Romanian spirituality, the securing of free flow of persons, 
especially for the youth who want to learn in Romania. I cannot 
watch indifferently the degradation or destruction of Romanian 
vestiges and historical monuments in Ukraine's territory and the 
measures that prevent the free expression of the Romanians' 
opinions, as is the case of the PLAI ROMANESC [ROMANIAN LAND] 
newspaper", said Teodor Melescanu. He stressed that "the 
problems of the situation of Romanians in Ukraine and of 
Ukrainians in Romania are a matter of official talks at the 
level of the two Foreign Ministries pursuing the signing of 
official documents". 
  The territories in today's Ukraine inhabited by Romanians 
are 
parts of Bessarabia and Bucovina -- ancient Romanian territories 
-- annexed by the former USSR in 1940 pursuant to the 
Ribbentrop- Molotov pact which has been disavowed these last few 
years.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 19/1/1994 -- "Above all, this 
visit has demonstrated Romania's interest in expanding the 
relations with China. Second, it is important in the field of 
direct economic relations, of exchanges", stated State Minister 
Mircea Cosea, president of the Council on Economic Coordination, 
Strategy and Reform, on his return on January 19 from a visit to 
China. 
  While in China, the Romanian Government delegation was 
received by the vice-president of the republic, the president of 
the Committee on Reform, and the administrations of provinces in 
southern China. "We discussed about the reform, got to know the 
big economic achievements, the fantastic dynamics of the 
southern zones of China and have established the coordinates of 
relations of collaboration not only in the domain of reform but 
also as regards the revigoration of economic exchanges" Cosea 
added. 
  Expressing satisfaction at the results of the visit, he also 
assessed it has demonstrated both parties' wish "to further the 
traditional Romanian-Chinese relations also in the new 
conditions the two countries are achieving now in the economic 
and social life."

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 17/1/1994 -- "It was an attempt 
against the constitutional democracy in Romania," said Romanian 
Constitutional Court Judge Antonie Iorgovan, cited by the daily 
ADEVARUL, referring to the news broadcasted by the National 
Television on Saturday, January 14, informing that the Hungarian 
Democratic Union of Romania [UDMR], the ethnic party of the 
Hungarian minority, had met with mayors of several localities to 
discuss the issue of "self-governing." 
  Judge Antonie Iorgovan, who is also professor of 
constitutional law of the Bucharest University, reminds that 
Romania's constitution does not provide such a concept because 
of the simple reason that there is only one government in a 
unitary state, politically responsible in front of the single 
parliament as the representative body of the Romanian nation." 
  Antonie Iorgovan reminded also that the "self-governing" 
wording was not stipulated by any unitary state's constitution 
in Western Europe as they consecrated a regional system of local 
administration and not a departmental system." Antonie Iorgovan 
draws attention also to the fact that even though only a 
departmental system of administrative-territorial organization 
in counties exists in Romania and not one recognizing regions, 
lands, provinces or communities, "there are political forces who 
employ such wording." Judge Iorgovan cites the Article 31, 
Paragraph 7, of the constitution as saying: "Any defamation of 
the country and the nation, instigation to a war of aggression, 
to national, racial, class or religious hatred, any incitement 
to discrimination, territorial separatism, public violence as 
well as an obscene conduct contrary to morality are prohibited 
by law." 
  The public opinion in Romania has repeatedly showed in the 
recent years, its concern with regard to the statements made by 
several UDMR leaders questioning directly or in a dissimulated 
way the issue of Transylvania, ancient Romanian territory, 
temporarily under the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Habsburg 
empire, till 1918. 
  According to the January 1992 census, the population of the 
counties of the historic province of Transylvania is made up by 
Romanians with 72.3 percent.

  [Text] Piestany, west Slovakia, Jan 14 (CTK) -- Czech 
Interior Minister Jan Ruml and his Slovak counterpart Jozef 
Tuchyna agreed on a solution for three disputed border areas, 
they told journalists today. Both parties accepted the idea 
that an optimum solution had to suit people on both sides of the 
border, they said. 
  The fourth and last disputed area -- the Kasarna recreation 
grounds -- is yet to be discussed by the two countries' premiers. 
  In keeping with petitions by the people who live there, the 
ministers recommend that the Slovak village Sidonia be joined 
with the Czech Republic and, conversely, the U Sabotu 
neighborhood be joined with Slovakia. The 123 hectares acquired 
by the Czech Republic as a result of the straightening of the 
course of the river Morava will be compensated for by an extra 
area of U Sabotu and a railway station near Vrbovce. 
  On the basis of the two ministers' recommendations, a 
national frontier bill is to be drawn up for consideration in 
the parliaments of their respective countries.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 14 (CTK) -- "We do not have the 
feeling of living in an enemy-surrounded fort," Slovak Culture 
Minister Dusan Slobodnik said today in an interview with CTK in 
which he expressed disappointment over misconceptions about the 
independent Slovakia spread by both the Slovak and foreign media. 
  "They all write about the budget deficit, growing 
unemployment, `sugar affair' (concerning the repayment of an 
Indian debt to Slovakia), and comment on fictitious speeches by 
Meciar -- but they pass over the fact that Slovakia has the 
smallest national debt per person of the post-communist 
countries," Slobodnik said. 
  "The struggle against Slovakia is essentially economic. 
Slovakia is portrayed in a negative way. What happens next is 
that some capitalists, say from the Netherlands, who want to 
invest in Central Europe and who have read such information, say 
to themselves: 'With this kind of situation there, it would be 
better to avoid Slovakia and invest the millions in Hungary and 
the Czech Republic instead,' and that indeed is the aim of the 
propaganda," Slobodnik says. 
  Frequent criticism leveled against Slovak Premier Vladimir 
Meciar by the opposition press is a sign, Slobodnik says, of a 
"concerted attack directed by someone hiding behind the scenes 
who objects to the fact that Meciar is leading Slovakia to 
prosperity and who is bent on replacing him with a new premier, 
more amenable and responsive to foreign pressure. 
  "When you, the Czech journalists, do it, it is to some 
degree 
logical since you thus support the position of the Czech lands. 
But when Slovak journalists do this, it is a case of 
intentionally harming Slovak interests. 
  "What we do with such journalists? We tolerate them, we 
respect democracy," Slobodnik says. 
  "Slovakia will attain the goals it aims for, albeit with 
some 
detours, and then it will remember those who stood in its way." 
  At a recent Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) 
meeting, Slobodnik pointed a finger at an opposition journalist. 
  "You do not understand that when you shower the premier with 
abuse, it will have an opposite effect. It has happened once 
before with Meciar. When they willfully removed him from the 
government, his popularity increased. An objective survey would 
show that his popularity has been growing since last October, 
because people think: 'this man is being hunted.' 
  "They stooped to fabricating a speech Meciar allegedly made 
at Zlata Idka, but they used at least ten different voices," 
Slobodnik said. 
  A HZDS east Slovak regional meeting took place at Zlata 
Idka, 
east Slovakia, on November 27-28, 1993. 
  "This republic is stronger than the antagonistic journalists 
would have it. Life has been difficult for the government, it 
has a lot of enemies who would like to pick up power in the 
streets, but they will not succeed. Slovak people do not want a 
new government. 
  "People are able to see that the HZDS is the only force that 
has fought uncompromisingly for Slovak interests without seeking 
any benefits for itself. Various things have been written about 
Meciar and me but nobody has dared to say that we have been 
profiteering. The present government is incorruptible," 
Slobodnik says. 
  "The HZDS is destined to win the next elections. It will not 
gain as many votes as in 1992, but it will still receive three 
to four percent more than the Democratic Left Party (SDL). I 
bet five bottles of whisky against one. Are you on?."

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 18 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government 
believes that the screening or lustration law, "in its full 
scale," contradicts the Slovak Constitution as it discriminates 
against some categories of people, does not respect the 
presumption of innocence and the need for consideration of 
individual cases in court, government representatives told 
journalists today. 
  The government has therefore decided to ask the 
Constitutional Court to rule whether or not the lustration law 
is compatible with the Slovak Constitution, they said. State 
Secretary in the Slovak Ministry of Justice Milan Handel pointed 
to several cases in which one person has been screened both 
positively and negatively. 
  Hanzel ruled out the possibility of political aspects 
influencing the government decision, arguing that the ministry 
had been dealing solely with "the judicial part of the matter." 
  He said the ministry had received some 50 complaints in 
connection with the lustration law. He did not, however, give 
the number of people who have been screened in Slovakia. 
  The screening law passed by the now-defunct Czechoslovak 
Federal Parliament in 1991 bars former Communist Party 
officials, agents of the former secret police (StB) and members 
of the people's militia (Communist Party Armed Force) from high 
economic and political posts until 1996.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 14 (CTK) -- Slovak President Michal 
Kovac today appreciated the decision made by Hungarian ethnic 
minority's elected representatives from southern Slovakia to 
solve problems of the region by constitutional and legal means. 
  Slovak Television reported that Kovac today received the 
organizers of the January 8 meeting of elected representatives 
of the Hungarian ethnic minority from southern Slovakia in 
Komarno, south Slovakia, which was initiated by the Association 
of Towns and Villages of Zitny Ostrov (ZMOZO). 
  Originally it was said that the Komarno meeting would 
declare 
autonomy in southern Slovakia and elect a 100-member assembly. 
Eventually, the meeting decided to push for the minority's 
demands in the Slovak Parliament. 
  Some 560,000 ethnic Hungarians live in Slovakia, most of 
them 
in the south. They constitute 11 percent of the country's 
population. 
  Kovac's Spokesman Anton Bodis said that Kovac would comment 
on the resolutions from the meeting, which he obtained today, 
after he had thoroughly studied them. 
  The meeting called for collective rights of the Hungarian 
minority to be embedded in the Slovak Constitution, and demanded 
that the Hungarians be allowed to use their language in official 
contact at any place where they make up at least one-tenth of 
the population, that they be represented in state bodies and 
public institutions proportionately to their number, and that 
they be allotted a relevant share of the state budget.

  [Text] Kosice, east Slovakia, Jan 17 (CTK) -- 
Representatives of Romanies from eastern Slovakia today 
expressed apprehension about the "irresponsible escalation of 
civic and national tension raised knowingly by leaders of 
Hungarian ethnic political parties." 
  In a statement issued on the occasion of the current visit 
by 
a Council of Europe delegation to Slovakia and given to CTK 
today leaders of Romany organizations of the Kosice district 
represented in the Association Council of Slovak Romanies 
protested efforts by Hungarian parties to create an autonomous 
ethnic territorial unit with "exceptional" rights for ethnic 
Hungarians in southern Slovakia. 
  "Apart from other non-Hungarians at least 200,000 Romanies 
also live in southern Slovakia. Although they have declared 
themselves to belong to the Hungarian minority, national 
minority rights which are being fully enjoyed by ethnic 
Hungarians have never been applied to Romanies," the statement 
says. 
  The Romanies appealed to the Slovak Government, parliament, 
and Council of Europe not to confine themselves to dealing with 
"pseudo-national" claims, but to at last stop the economic 
decline of Slovakia and to pay more attention to abolishing the 
reasons for the impoverishment of Slovakia's population. 
  The government and parliament do not respect Romanies' 
views, 
ideas, and proposals concerning their own cultural development. 
By hiding their heads in the sand they support intolerance 
towards Romanies and condone their "spiritual genocide." 
  According to a spokesman of the Union of Romanies Civic 
Initiative, Slovak Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac is to meet 
with Romany representatives in Kosice in the near future.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 15 (CTK) -- SNS General Secretary 
Igor Uhrik today resigned from his position today at a session 
of the party's Central Council. Uhrik told journalists after 
leaving the meeting room, that the Slovak National Party (SNS) 
faced the decision of whether to "slavishly support" the 
destructive policies of Premier Vladimir Meciar or to create a 
constructive alternative. 
  Today's decisions are not guided by a search for truth and 
constructive solutions, but by the corruption of some SNS 
members by Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), 
Uhrik said. He declined to go into details about the 
corruption, but said it was one of the causes for the party's 
current crisis. Uhrik said he had spoken out for party unity 
and the dismissal of party functionaries under HZDS influence. 
  The Central Council had earlier refused to accept Uhrik's 
resignation, which Uhrik took as a sign that the council was 
"distancing itself from the methods of the past carried out by a 
small group of people in the leadership." 
  Yet this group applied these very methods recently against 
SNS Chairman Ludovit Cernak, who was accused of undemocratically 
splitting the party and of holding secret talks with Hungarian 
politicians on toppling the Meciar government. The anti-Cernak 
faction has, "besides lying and hitting below the belt, not 
shrunk from calling up the image of a bloody conflict in 
southern Slovakia, just in order to get rid of the chairman," 
Uhrik said. 
  Today's Central Council session is expected to resolve the 
conflict between Cernak and his party opponents, Deputy Premiers 
Marian Andel and Jozef Prokes, who advocate drawing the SNS 
closer to, or even uniting with, the HZDS. 
  "Today we must decide unambiguously between two party 
lines," 
Cernak told CTK earlier today. He said he intended to call for 
a party congress to decide the issue, since only a congress can 
make personnel changes in top party functions.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 16 (CTK) -- The internal crisis of 
the Slovak National Party (SNS) is likely to be solved only by 
the party's extraordinary congress convoked for February 19 to 
Zilina, central Slovakia, SNS Central Council decided at its 
session last night. 
  The Saturday [15 January] session resulted in considerable 
weakening of the position of SNS Chairman Ludovit Cernak, after 
his party rivals headed by Slovak Deputy Premiers Marian Andel 
and Jozef Prokes pushed through the dismissal of the present 
party leadership. The chairman himself (Cernak) remains in the 
post. 
  In its resolution the meeting expressed disquiet about SNS 
disintegration "at the time when Hungarian irredentists 
jeopardize our country's integrity in south Slovakia." 
  SNS First Deputy Chairman Igor Uhrik resigned from his post 
at the meeting, while Cernak was expressed no confidence and 
asked to resign, and Deputy Chairmen Anton Hrnko, Andrej Findo, 
Jan Hurny, Anna Malikova, and Central Secretary Jozef Hrabina 
were dismissed. 
  The Council rejected the split of the present SNS 
parliamentary group of deputies by the establishment of the 
National Democratic Group, and asked the six deputies of this 
group headed by Cernak to rejoin the "only legitimate" SNS group 
(now comprising 8 members) or to offer their resignation from 
their deputies' posts so that they can be replaced by other SNS 
members. 
  The Central Council charged Cernak, Andel, Prokes, and 
Miloslav Kona, chairman of the SNS Group of Deputies, to held 
talks with the SNS coalition partner, the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). So far it has been only Cernak who 
has negotiated with the Premier Vladimir Meciar-led HZDS. 
  A press conference which took place in the night only 
confirmed the controversies between the SNS two factions over 
the further functioning of the HZDS-SNS government coalition, 
and the future identity of the SNS. 
  Prokes criticized Cernak's leadership for behaving 
alternately as coalition and opposition body, which impaired the 
image of Slovakia's stability abroad. Cernak expressed his 
reservations about the so far functioning of the government 
coalition.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 15 (CTK) -- Democratic Left Party 
(SDL) Chairman Peter Weiss said in an interview for CTK today 
that he appreciated the expression of trust in him expressed by 
the party's Executive Committee last night in voting not to 
remove him from office. 
  Weiss had offered to resign as chairman after inadvertently 
voting for the government's 1994 budget proposal, which he had 
strongly opposed from the beginning. The Executive Committee 
decided last night not to accept his resignation. 
  "I especially appreciate that the SDL bodies are able to 
discuss democratically, openly, and without raising of voices 
"such personally and politically complex problems such as I 
caused with my mistaken vote," he said. 
  Weiss said that the conditions under which the SDL would 
agree to participate in the broader coalition government called 
for by President Michal Kovac were defined by the limits of the 
party's program. "The decisive thing for us would be the kind of 
support such a government would be able to muster in parliament, 
and how it would be composed," he said. 
  The development of the political situation hangs primarily 
on 
that part of the deputies group of the ruling Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) which rejects confrontational and 
uncooperative policies and recognizes its joint responsibility 
for the deepening of the political crisis. "We can't make that 
decision for them," Weiss said. 
  Weiss avoided answering directly the question whether or not 
he would accept the present premier and HZDS leader, Vladimir 
Meciar, as head of the broad coalition government. He mentioned 
Meciar's statement on Friday [14 January] that he (Meciar) had 
made serious offers to SDL regarding the creation of a 
coalition, but said it was impossible to consider the offer 
seriously, given Meciar's controversial statements after his 
return from the United States in 1993, that "SDL participation 
in the government was unacceptable abroad." On the other hand, 
Meciar said another day that the SDL had missed a historical 
chance when it passed up creating a coalition with the HZDS, 
Weiss noted. 
  "The HZDS idea that the SDL will provide experts to push for 
HZDS policies without any possibility of criticism is simply 
naive. A coalition does not mean that the HZDS will be 
exclusively in power, while the SDL would exclusively bear the 
responsibility," Weiss stressed. 
  The SDL has not yet received any signals that the HZDS wants 
to correct its policy, he added. 
  In 1994, the SDL wants to contribute to overcoming the 
domestic political crisis, which the creation of the HZDS-SNS 
coalition government had failed to do. 
  "We must be prepared for a situation when the ratio of 
forces 
in the parliament changes to an extent which makes power sharing 
possible. We are a party not indifferent to the fate of our 
homeland, but interested in building a prosperous state. We are 
aware of our share of responsibility for Slovakia's direction," 
Weiss added.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 17 (CTK) -- "The Party of the 
Democratic Left (SDL) is the most serious rival of the Hungarian 
Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH) and the Egyutteles movement 
in southern Slovakia, therefore all our efforts at solving the 
minority problem are unacceptable for their representatives," 
SDL Chairman Peter Weiss told CTK today. 
  The MKDH and Egyutteles are Slovak parliamentary opposition 
parties representing the country's Hungarian minority (14 seats 
in the 150-seat Slovak parliament), the SDL is the strongest 
opposition party (28 seats). 
  Weiss was reacting to the statements made recently by MKDH 
Chairman Bela Bugar, who had accused the SDL of being insincere. 
SDL representatives allegedly present accommodation stands on 
the ethnic minority problem, but on the other hand, "even after 
one year and one month, they were not able to take as stance 
towards the draft constitutional law on ethnic minorities 
presented to them by its creators from the MKDH and the 
Egyutteles" Bugar said at an MKDH press conference. 
  "We have declared publicly that we could not accept the 
draft 
law due to its legal shortcomings. We agreed on bilateral talks 
with Hungarian representatives in order to consult our 
reservations at the level of experts. However, they submitted a 
bill to the parliament last June without consulting with us," 
Weiss said. 
  He stressed that the ethnic minority problem could be solved 
neither if the parliamentary majority outvoted the minority, nor 
if the Hungarian minority tried to "make the remaining part of 
the parliament accept its views as the only correct and 
possible, and complained with the Council of Europe in case of 
their rejection." 
  Weiss said he was surprised by the statement of Erno Rozsa, 
a 
deputy from the MKDH-Egyutteles coalition, that "all demands of 
the Hungarian minority will be met." Weiss asked whom the MKDH 
and the Egyutteles wanted to cooperate with, when they do not 
create conditions for cooperation with the SDL, the parliament's 
second strongest party, or with some other party. 
  Slovakia would not be in the limelight abroad if the ethnic 
minority claims had been solved in a comprehensive way, on the 
basis of a certain state concept, which would have resulted in 
passing the mentioned constitutional law, Weiss said. 
  "Representatives of the MKDH and Egyutteles made use of the 
Slovak Government's incoherent position to push through demands 
which will meet with political support in the Slovak parliament 
only with great difficulties," Weiss said, referring to the 
results of the meeting of Slovakia's ethnic Hungarian 
representatives in Komarno, south Slovakia, earlier this month. 
  About 560,000 ethnic Hungarians (11 percent of the country's 
total population) live in southern Slovakia.

  [Text] At the invitation of the Albanian minister of 
industry and trade, Greek Alternate National Economy Minister 
Ioannis Papandoniou arrived in Tirana today. Mr. Papandoniou 
heads a government economic delegation from the ministry and 
representatives of Greek chambers of commerce, various firms, 
etc. 
  Mr. Papandoniou, whose visit to Tirana is his first foreign 
trip since Greece took over the presidency of the EC, was 
welcomed at Rinas Airport by Selim Belortaja, Albanian minister 
for industry and trade. Khristodhoulos Tsalikis, ambassador of 
the Greek Republic in Tirana, was also present. 
  Official talks between Belortaja and Papandoniou started 
this 
afternoon. In his speech, Mr. Belortaja stressed the special 
importance of this meeting, which he said was a chance to 
examine problems arising from proposals to further bilateral 
relations in the field of the economy, and also that, in 
Albania's foreign trade relations, trade and cooperation with 
Greece occupy a special place. He said that trade with Greece 
accounts for 14 percent of our foreign trade. Of course, such a 
level of cooperation is due to the historical relations between 
both peoples, the reciprocity of the economies of both 
countries, and the political goodwill on the part of both 
governments to further bilateral relations. 
  In his speech, Minister Papandoniou said that he felt it his 
duty to reiterate the warm atmosphere of Greek-Albanian 
relations, which have their basis in the historical ties and 
cooperation between the two countries and which are being 
advanced a step further with the visit of Foreign Minister 
Papoulias to Tirana. 
  As EC president, Greece has an opportunity to help Albania 
to 
pass through this difficult transition period, the Greek 
minister told his Albanian counterpart, promising help even 
after Greece's EC presidency is over. 
  He also concretely specified fields of cooperation. 
Attaching great importance to bilateral trade, Mr. Papandoniou 
stressed that trade should be developed in the border areas and 
generally be advanced in the future. 
  On agriculture, he presented Greece's great interest and 
that 
of Greek firms in increasing investment in Albania in this area 
and stressed the encouragement and assistance that the Greek 
Government would provide for them. The Greek National Bank 
would like to open a representative office in Tirana, while the 
Greek Agricultural Bank has already drafted two projects. 
  Leaving the issue open, Mr. Papandoniou stressed that they 
would discuss it extensively in talks with experts. Electricity 
production was also of interest to the Greek side and would 
require broad discussion by both sides. 
  In his proposals, the Greek minister focused on the 
possibilities of cooperation to improve Albanian ports, with the 
idea of creating a joint commission of experts to carry out 
relevant studies. He also briefed them on the EC project on 
transportation and within this framework he offered cooperation 
for joint road networks. 
  To conclude, Minister Papandoniou expressed optimism for the 
course of bilateral relations, which, according to him, were 
conditioned by the existence of the Greek minority in Albania 
and Albanian citizens in Greece. 
  Mr. Belortaja commented on the outline that his Greek 
counterpart had made about prospects for bilateral relations, 
stressing that the Greek offer of cooperation was very diverse. 
He also pointed out the special values of the joint commissions 
in agriculture, trade, etc., and told the Greek side that it 
should brief the Albanian Government on concrete issues, so as 
to take the necessary decisions, which will open the way to 
broader cooperation. 
  The Greek Government economic delegation is continuing its 
working visit to Tirana.

  [Text] After the meeting of the Albanian-Greek Joint 
Commission, which discussed economic and technical issues 
related to bilateral cooperation, the Greek government 
delegation conducted other business talks today. 
  Talks began at the Agriculture and Food Industry, where Mr. 
Papandoniou was received by Agriculture and Food Minister Halili. 
  The Greek economic delegation held talks with Ministers 
Bitincka [transportation] and Dishnica [finance] and with Deputy 
Prime Minister Kopliku. During the meetings, talks focused on 
resolving the problems in which the possibilities and facilities 
are more present for both sides to contribute to programmed 
cooperation. 
  In these meetings, Mr. Papandoniou stressed once more the 
importance of the fact that Greece will head the EC presidency 
for six months. He mentioned the sum of 350 million [as heard] 
ECU that the EC has planned to provide for transports and 
infrastructure during this year. During the talks, they spoke 
about the possibilities of providing financial support to 
Albanian transportation in general. 
  The Greek side also presented concrete projects to Mr. 
Bitincka, assuring him of the Greek Government's support for 
companies that may invest to improve the Albanian 
transportation. The delegation continues its visit in Tirana.

  [Text] Continuing his talks in Tirana today, Greek 
Alternate National Economy Minister Papandoniou was received by 
Deputy Prime Minister Bashkim Kopliku. The Kopliku-Papandoniou 
talks concentrated on Albania's needs for investments and, in 
this framework, they discussed what both parties can profit from 
the EC project on transports. 
  Mentioning the fund of 350 milliard [billion] ECU that the 
EC 
is offering for the European project on transportation, for 
road, air, and naval transportation, and especially for ports, 
something which is favored by the position of Greece as EC 
president, Mr. Papandoniou stressed the interests of both sides 
and the need to profit in time. 
  Albanian Deputy Prime Minister Kopliku made an outline of 
the 
present state of the development of the reform and the need that 
this phase presents for investments. They also discussed 
concrete fields of cooperation and stressed the need to 
strengthen economic cooperation, something which favors the 
strengthening of bilateral relations in general.

  [Text] The meeting held this afternoon between Foreign 
Minister Alfred Serreqi and Ioannis Papandoniou, Greek alternate 
national economy minister, assessed Papandoniou's visit to 
Tirana, following that of Papoulias some time ago, as a concrete 
step toward implementation of economic cooperation between both 
countries, in the framework of an atmosphere of good cooperation 
that is in the interest not only of Albania and Greece but also 
of our turbulent region. 
  The existence of the Greek minority in Albania and of 
Albanian refugees in Greece are circumstances that favor this 
cooperation and ease bilateral understanding. Mr. Serreqi 
stressed that, viewed from a judicial aspect and considering the 
resources it possesses, Albania, which has made concrete steps 
toward a market economy, sees as a favorable circumstance the 
fact that Greece, as the only Balkan country near the EC and 
being the EC president for the current six-month period, can 
possibly influence Albania's concrete engagement in EC economic 
projects.

  [Text] We want Albanian-Greek relations to achieve new 
developments because we have common interests, and so far we 
have not resolved them at each other's expense but by helping 
each other, Mr. Meksi said to Ioannis Papandoniou, Greek 
alternate national economy minister. 
  Prime Minister Meksi brought up numerous reasons for the 
necessity of bilateral cooperation in all fields. He asked for 
an expeditious start to real work either through joint 
commissions or contacts at various levels by government 
officials and experts. 
  Mr. Meksi stressed that Greece, as EC chairman, needs to 
directly engage itself in the direction of Albania, so as to 
include Albania in the projects of this development institution, 
especially in the big transportation program. 
  Papandoniou called the spirit of relations between both 
countries excellent, and stressed the good level of political 
relations. He brought a message of friendship to Albanian Prime 
Minister Meksi from Greek Prime Minister Papandreou, wishing a 
move from stationary climate into concrete results. 
  Further, he focused on EC projects to revive the European 
economy and expressed the desire that a segment of the program 
finds space in our region and that both countries profit from 
this big project. 
  Welcoming the Greek party's proposal, Mr. Meksi expressed 
the 
desire to immediately and expeditiously start their 
implementation.

  [Text] [Announcer] The Greek government economic 
delegation chaired by Alternate National Economy Minister 
Papandoniou has ended its business visit in Tirana. The 
Albanian-Greek Joint Commission signed the protocol of the 
fourth session of cooperation. For further details, let's 
listen to this report. 
  [Koleci] This morning Messrs. Belortaja and Papandoniou, 
chairmen of the Albanian-Greek Joint Commission, signed a 
business protocol with the goal and desire to pass on to 
concrete actions. During the ceremony our industry and trade 
minister stated: 
  [Begins Belortaja recording, in Albanian with 
passage-by-passage translation into Greek] If we could 
characterize briefly, concrete character is its main feature. 
We surpassed the protocols, put forward the platforms, and 
tried to open the way to concrete projects, which will 
strengthen and intensify the economic cooperation between both 
countries. [end recording] 
  [Koleci] Mr. Papandoniou, too, felt optimistic about 
Albanian-Greek cooperation. 
  [Begin Papandoniou recording, in Greek with one 
passage-by-passage translation into Albanian] The results were 
very positive. [end recording] 
  [Koleci] It is a new initiative for the relations between 
both countries. He assessed the signing of protocol as a 
station in the further road of cooperation. The Greek minister 
continues to say that both governments decided to cooperate in 
the bilateral terrain and in the EC framework. 
  The protocol signed by both commission chairmen speaks about 
the encouragement of Greek investments in Albania, the 
possibilities of abolishing double taxation in the trade between 
both countries, the elaboration of the remaining part of the 
Greek aid for our country, construction of the 
Durres-Vlore-Kakavije road, and the use of hydropower on the 
Vjose River. 
  The experts of both countries will meet in Greece on 
February 
to discuss cooperation in the field of agriculture and 
livestock. Thus, the protocol envisages the main commitments of 
the signing parties to strengthen the Albanian-Greek relations. 
  The Greek government economic delegation left our country 
this morning.

  [Excerpt] Democratic Party Chairman Eduard Selami held a 
news conference today. Let's hear a report by our correspondent 
Zamira Koleci. 
  [Koleci] At the news conference held this morning Democratic 
Party [PD] leader Selami stressed the party goals for 1994, a 
year that he considered to be very important in accomplishing 
the PD's program. He greeted the political event that opened 
this year -- the Partnership for Peace initiative -- as an 
active step toward Albania's admission to NATO. 
  Selami viewed the policy of rapid privatization and the 
proprietorship of as many people as possible as an important 
social step that will be accompanied by the introduction of 
securities, as defined in the PD's electoral program. He went 
on to say that they will be paying attention to increasing 
foreign and domestic investment and providing the political 
conditions to attract it. 
  He considered 1994 an important year for Albanian farmers, 
too. The support of 3,000 tractors given to farmers will 
continue, ensuring financial support through the banks. 
  In his statement, Selami also spoke about the political 
situation, stressing that leftist extremists have introduced a 
nihilistic, destructive, and unstable platform, and he explained 
this in terms of the hopeless attempts of those who have lost 
power. 
  In answer to a question, Selami said that tensions have been 
artificially increased and they are related to initiating the 
trial of Alia and Nano, who seem to have put into motion many of 
their old and dubious ties. 
  Selami said that the PD favors dialogue and this requires a 
serious commitment. Meanwhile, the Democratic Alliance [AD] is 
accusing the PD of organizing crime at all levels. Selami said 
that they had declared that they are the opposition but 
brothers, while the AD leaders are for freedom or death. 
  PD Secretary General Tritan Shehu repeated yesterday's 
request to parliament that its Foreign Committee examine the AD 
visit to Belgrade, which, according to Shehu, is against the 
national interest. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Where Is Shkoder Going"] </F>
  [Text] Another blood score has been recorded in Shkoder, 
as if the 150 people who are besieged in their homes, sheltered 
from feuds started in their fathers' times, and possibly even 
their unremembered grandfathers', were not enough. These 150 
families owe blood under the Canon of Lek Dukagjin. They expect 
nothing from the laws of this state. The state does not protect 
them. This state throws them on welfare and leaves them under 
siege, including their children and associates. This state is 
paralyzed, humbled by the Canon of Lek Dukagjin. Meanwhile, the 
family of Gjovalin Cekini has a blood score to settle with the 
government. They expect the judiciary to respond to the crime 
before they heed the call to arms of their ancestors, the 
weapons of the Canon of Lek Dukagjin. The government, after 
all, has the chance to triumph over Lek showing that it is no 
longer the government of 2 April [1991] that murdered by night 
and shed tears by day. It has an opportunity to avert one more 
murder. It has the opportnity to remove the checkpoint on 
Bahcellek bridge, over which criminals enter and leave Shkoder. 
It has the opportunity to rescue Shkoder from isolation from 
the rest of Albania, as if we were in the time of the 
principality of Kara Mahmut Bushatlliu. Shkoder is becoming 
isolated. Caught up in the spider's web of the embargo, the 
city is writhing in agony and devouring its own citizens. It 
was corruption and the representatives of corruption in Shkoder, 
tension, and the absence of a political breathing space that 
murdered Gjovaiin Cekini. It was the logic of Kara Mdhmut 
Buchatlliu in the mouths of oil smugglers and the smugglers of 
infants, that called Shkoder the citadel of the Democrats. Once 
it was the citadel of the Communists, and before that it was a 
principality, before Albania existed, although it was Albanian 
before the principality existed. The language of the party 
faithful is sending Shkoder back in time, toward experiences of 
this kind, inexorably shifting the barrier of the embargo from 
Han i Hotit to Bahcellek bridge [from the Albanian-Montenegrin 
border to the southern entrance to the City of Shkoder], 
separating the city from Albania. This kind of talk calls for 
aid from the phantom of Lek Dukagjio. Quo vadis Scutari? 
Shkoder, where are you going?

<F P=106> [Statement issued by a Defense Ministry spokesman in Tirana </F>
on 21 January; read by announcer -- recorded] 
  [Text] The newspaper KOHA JONE published an article today 
with the bombastic headline "Massive Disarmament of the Albanian 
Army," written by Martin Leka. This newspaper has published 
such articles before with the aim of slandering and dismantling 
the Army. Today's malicious article is false and does not 
represent the reality in the present process of strengthening 
and modernizing the Army. 
  We can neither speak nor think about the disarmament of 
officers. The integration of our Army into the democratic 
society we are building requires that officers, while in the 
garrison, be properly equipped. When they leave the barracks or 
training facilities to go into the city, they are citizens. 
  We are presently working to administer, preserve, nurture, 
and maintain armament and military equipment according to 
international standards. This is also an experience of all NATO 
countries that apply the same practice. The suppositions and 
insinuations for a drastic shortage and incidents on the part of 
officers are as provocative as they are malicious. 
  With these lies and slanders, irresponsible correspondents 
want to create panic, a shadow of doubt, dissatisfaction, and 
division in the Army and among the people. However, Belgrade's 
lackeys and their notorious newspaper KOHA JONE, enraged by the 
achievements of our Army, especially the very successful meeting 
with a U.S. Defense Department delegation, and, as it seems, 
financed by Belgrade, are doing everything in their power to 
reduce the value of the Albanian Army, which is certainly 
progressing toward its uninterrupted strengthening. 
  The attacks by Enverists, Belgrade's lackeys, and other 
antinational elements against the Army and national defense will 
fail. The order in question is based on Law No. 74-96, dated 3 
July 1991, Article 4 of the Law on Arms, and Decree No. 74-49, 
dated 5 January 1991, as well as the order by the general 
commander of the Armed Forces of the Republic No. 01, dated 13 
May 1992, on the improvement of the performance of service in 
inhabited centers. 
  Based on current law, the defense minister has the right to 
issue orders and instructions on the maintenance, 
administration, and preservation of armament and other military 
equipment. These acts constitute a military secret. The 
revelation, publication, and propagation of these acts are 
convicted by law. For this reason, the defense minister has 
initiated legal proceedings, says the Defense Ministry spokesman.

  [Text] Budapest, Jan 21 (AFP) -- Ukraine has apparently 
returned 200 million kilowatt-hours of energy it drew in extra 
imports from the joint Centrel electric system of eastern 
European countries, the Hungarian national electricity 
distribution centre said Friday [21 January]. 
  Over the past fortnight, the Centrel system maintained 
normal 
frequency levels after considerable fluctuation caused by 
unplanned Ukrainian imports since November, officials of the 
centre said. 
  The fluctuations caused slowdowns and overstrain with 
electric appliances, and Centrel countries -- the Czech 
republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and the eastern 
part of Germany -- threatened Ukraine with separating it from 
the grid if it failed to return the energy drawn until Friday. 
  Ukraine was forced to import more energy than it had planned 
due to severe fuel shortages there. Hungary supplied a quarter 
of the extra energy drawn.

<F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Zhelyu Zhelev; place and </F>
date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Citizens of the Republic of Bulgaria: 
  Over the last two years, I have had to address you three 
times on the subject of crime. The last address was in 
parliament at the beginning of June 1993. At that time, I 
insistently requested the National Assembly to give priority to 
adopting the fundamental laws on the court, the police, and 
state employees, as well as the necessary amendments to the 
Penal and Penal Procedural Codes. All of this had to be done in 
order to stop organized crime, which threatens us more and more 
every day. 
  Unfortunately, certain deputies at the time viewed my 
address 
as a populist move, aimed to enhance my popularity, rather than 
an attempt on my part to seek a constructive solution to the 
problems. 
  Now -- seven months later and after a series of dramatic 
events that showed the existence of organized crime in a 
dangerous scope and the elements of the Mafia, or at least the 
existence of preconditions of a Mafia emergence -- the same 
people pretend to be surprised and try to pass the 
responsibility off to the executive power, mostly to the police. 
  I am far from exonerating the police and the executive 
power, 
because they bear a large part of the responsibility. However, 
I am puzzled by the fact that, while a danger exists for the 
legal order in our country, responsible institutions, political 
forces, and individual politicians continue to seek political 
dividends in the tragedy that occurred. Instead of realizing 
their own responsibility for the country's situation, they pass 
the guilt on to each other -- the parliament to the police and 
the government, the police to the court and the Prosecutor's 
Office, the court and the Prosecutor's Office to the court and 
the investigative bodies, the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] to 
the Union of the Democratic Forces [SDS], the SDS to the BSP, 
and so forth. This game is extremely dangerous, perhaps even 
lethal, for the state. I would like to remind you that crime 
does not distinguish between party colors and political 
convictions. It is directed against each one of us. Therefore, 
the political forces and the state institutions must not 
mutually seek each other's shortcomings but should unite their 
efforts against organized crime and corruption, with each one 
doing their share of the work. 
  The cabinet, being the executive power, must show whether it 
really can govern and whether it has the courage and will to 
implement its functions and guarantee order and calm in the 
country, as well as preserve the citizens' lives, property, 
honor, and dignity. The parliament, which for two years now has 
violated the constitutional requirements of anything related to 
the judicial system structure, must finally adopt with priority 
the necessary amendments to the Penal and Penal Procedural 
Codes, the bill on the judiciary's structure, and the bill on 
the state employee. Without adopting the bill on the judicial 
system and really and fully completing the structure of this 
system with a supreme administrative court, a supreme court of 
appeals, and local courts of appeals, Bulgaria will not have an 
independent and efficient judiciary that could battle against 
organized crime and the budding Mafia. 
  We expect the police, investigative authorities, the 
Prosecutor's Office, and the courts to immediately adopt 
energetic and bold steps aimed at imprisoning the criminals. I 
insist that all cases of overt banditry be investigated rapidly 
and without any pity. 
  The corrupt and inefficient employees of the Ministry of 
Interior, especially the leadership, must go in order to 
preserve the honor of the Bulgarian policemen who work under 
exceptionally grave conditions. There are too many responsible 
state officials and politicians who send nameless denunciations 
and speak anonymously about corruption and crime in the realm of 
the executive. Taking its cue from those denunciations, the 
press constantly write about corruption in the high echelons of 
the power. By doing so, certain newspapers are trying to suggest 
that all those who work there are corrupt. It is high time to 
speak clearly, precisely, and openly on this matter and point 
out specific names, facts, and documents. It is high time for 
the political forces to adopt their share of the responsibility, 
rather than wash their hands with political declarations and 
statements against crime. They must adopt the necessary laws in 
the parliament, as well as identify any corrupt politicians in 
their own ranks. This must be done, because there is nothing 
more pathetic than political forces that claim they are 
struggling against crime and yet they simultaneously tolerate 
people in their ranks who own a large-size financial property of 
an unclear origin. 
  It is not the Bulgarian citizens who should fear the 
criminals who walk free, but rather the criminals should fear 
the law and understand that wherever they hide, the judiciary 
will find them and punish them. 
  As far as I am concerned, I will not leave a single state 
institution or service in peace that could assist in the 
struggle against crime until it begins to service appropriately.

<F P=106> [Interview with Marin Todorov, former secretary of the </F>
Sanctions Commission, by Lyubomira Nikolaeva; place and date not 
given: "Additional Strict Measures Could Guarantee Embargo 
Observance"] 
  [Text] [Nikolaeva] Mr. Todorov, does your dismissal mean 
that Bulgaria is circumventing the Yugoembargo? 
  [Todorov] By no means. In the eyes of the international 
public, this will confirm that the Bulgarian Government is 
adopting additional measures on preventing any attempts to 
violate the sanctions. Changing the commission's chairman will 
not hurt Bulgaria's international status. 
  [Nikolaeva] You claim that you resigned at your own 
initiative. Why did you resign? 
  [Todorov] An opinion was voiced that... perhaps the control 
applied by the commission was not very efficient in the sense 
that if someone implements steps aimed at violating the embargo, 
this means that he thinks that the trade economic sanctions 
could be violated. In this context, I thought it would be 
better if another person replaced me. Perhaps he would adopt 
stricter measures.... 
  [Nikolaeva] In the past, you were chief of the prime 
minister's office. Was your appointment as an adviser on 
foreign economic issues and secretary of the Sanctions 
Commission the result of a blunder on your part or an award? 
  [Todorov] As chief of the prime minister's office, I had to 
deal with a broad range of issues, and I felt incompetent to 
deal with some of those issues. Therefore, I asked to be 
transferred to a job that I was more qualified for. I received 
my new appointment in May, and I think that it was a useful 
transfer. 
  [Nikolaeva] However, there are rumors that as secretary of 
the commission, you favored certain companies and persons -- for 
example, [former Deputy Prime Minister] Neycho Neev.... 
  [Todorov] My conscience is clear and I am completely calm. 
If ever I wanted to favor someone, I could not do so because 
there was no mechanism that could facilitate it. The efficiency 
of the control measures is another issue. It was discovered 
that new additional measures must be adopted if our country is 
to really implement its commitments to the United Nations and 
the international community. 
  [Nikolaeva] Do you mean special services that will control 
the customs officials? 
  [Todorov] I do not know; I was not consulted. 
  [Nikolaeva] Deputy Prime Minister Matinchev said that your 
dismissal was decided after [Interior Minister] Viktor 
Mikhaylov's report on attempts to violate the embargo.... 
  [Todorov] I tried to be useful, especially in the area of 
measures aimed at eliminating the losses and compensating for 
damages. I am an economist and my area of specialization is 
economic relations in the Balkans. As far as control is 
concerned.... the real control is being implemented by border 
guards and customs officials. 
  [Nikolaeva] What commission members are responsible for the 
control? 
  [Todorov] The working group on implementing the sanctions is 
in charge of the control. 
  [Nikolaeva] Who is the chief of this group? 
  [Todorov] Mr. Kulishev, deputy minister of finance and chief 
of the "Customs" State Administration. 
  [Nikolaeva] However, you are the one who was fired. Do you 
have any job offers -- for example, as a consultant for private 
companies? 
  [Todorov] Well.... for the time being, at least, I have no 
offers.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Ivan Ivanov, "head of the General </F>
Staff `Material and Financial Resources Planning' Department," 
by Major Spiridon Spiridonov; place and date not given: "Army 
Needs Much More Than 12.7 Billion Leva"] 
  [Excerpts] [Spiridonov] Is it true that the military 
budget has been constantly decreasing in recent years? 
  [Ivanov] During the 1989-1994 period there is a continuing 
tendency to reduce the country's military budget. If in 1989 it 
was 8.1 percent of the national budget in 1990 it decreased to 
6.7 percent. In 1991 and 1992 it was 7 percent, while in 1993 
it dropped to 5.7 percent. What is envisaged for 1994 is within 
the framework of 6.5 percent of the national budget, an amount 
that is smaller than the 1990 budget. We regress to a lower 
level. This is as far as absolute terms are is concerned. The 
amount is actually much less when you consider the inflation 
since 1990. 
  [Spiridonov] Is this tendency characteristic only of our 
country or also of our neighbors? 
  [Ivanov] As far as I know there is no such tendency among 
our neighbors. 
  [Spiridonov] The military themselves felt the insecurity and 
irregularity of receiving funds from the Ministry of Defense. 
  [Ivanov] For almost six months (until June, when the 1993 
budget was adopted), the army functioned with one twelfth of its 
1992 budget. Throughout that entire period the prices and 
inflation were completely different and the overall economic 
situation was much more complex. As a result, at the end of the 
first half of 1993 the army lagged behind in payments for 
supplies, services, and repairs, both locally and 
internationally, by more than $600 million. This fact had an 
exceptionally negative effect on the suppliers of the various 
branches of the army and resulted in refusal to supply the army 
with various materials. I mean food, clothing, water, electric 
power, and telephone services. The delay in the payments 
prompted the suppliers in question to refuse the army's supply 
orders. This process continued until the end of the year and 
produced our unpaid debt of 480 million leva. 
  [Spiridonov] The issue of the army wages is probably in the 
same category? 
  [Ivanov] All the established terms of paying army personnel 
were violated. Pay for army officers, non-commissioned 
officers, military employees, and soldiers was delayed by 5-10 
days. Another paradox emerged: In July 1993 the pay of the 
officers and non- commissioned officers was delayed by two 
weeks. Naturally, this created great tension in the army units. 
You know that in the remote garrisons, and not only there, the 
young military families are in a very grave situation. Spouses 
are unemployed and the families rely on a single salary. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Spiridonov] What resources does the army need in 1994? 
  [Ivanov] After most responsibly reviewing the real situation 
in the army and in accordance with the instructions of the 
Finance Ministry on preparing the 1994 budget we prepared the 
budget of the Ministry of Defense. All state institutions are 
familiar with it. It is the most economic variant, which has 
been coordinated with the army's real minimal needs. 
  [Spiridonov] Are you satisfied with the defense means 
envisaged by the Finance Ministry's draft budget? 
  [Ivanov] The total military budget proposed by the Finance 
Ministry amounts to 12.7 billion leva. It hardly covers a part 
of the army's real needs. Priority again was given to the 
everyday maintenance of the army, and not to the army's 
technical supply, for which only 5 percent of the budget has 
been envisaged. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Lajos Fur by Zoltan Fekete; </F>
place and date not given: "There Will Be Three State 
Secretaries in the Defense Ministry"] 
  [Text] [Fekete] Mr. Fur, the basic principles and laws 
worked out by your ministry have always shown a high level of 
compromise readiness. Do you think that the changes announced 
yesterday and valid as of 1 March will divide the public and 
possibly the army as well? 
  [Fur] I do not think so, because these changes are precisely 
the results of the Defense Law based on a broad parliamentary 
consensus. Every political force represented in parliament 
accepted the need and timing for these changes. Only the 
Hungarian Socialist Party would have carried out the changes 
after the elections. However, the law required the elimination 
of the divided structure, and our history and traditions also 
oblige us to create the leading army bodies required by NATO in 
its recent concept of Partnership for Peace. One of the major 
factors of joining NATO will be the assertion of civilian 
control over the Army and the guiding role of the political 
echelon in every country. On behalf of the Defense Ministry, I 
can assure you that we will continue to inform the political 
parties and groups immediately about our every concept and step 
and, according to the possibilities, we will also use their 
opinions. 
  [Fekete] What will the top leadership of the Defense 
Ministry consist of? 
  [Fur] According to our plans, and contrary to the current 
state administration practice, there will be three state 
secretaries in the Defense Ministry: a political state 
secretary, an administrative state secretary, and a state 
secretary who is an Army commander or chief of staff. 
  [Fekete] Many people fear that this structure could collapse 
if the defense minister is an Army officer. 
  [Fur] According to the general practice in Europe, the 
defense minister is a civilian, and I do not think that it is 
worth parting with this practice in the future. Our current 
step guarantees the institutional cooperation of the Defense 
Ministry and the Hungarian Army in harmony with the Defense Law, 
and it also improves their efficiency. 
  [Fekete] Some 10 days ago, you announced the retirement of 
some Army officers in leading positions. You also confirmed 
this during the government spokesman's news conference held on 
14 January. Does this mainly affect the Hungarian Army 
generals, or the staff of the Defense Ministry? 
  [Fur] The law and regulations stipulating the requirement 
for professional Army personnel to retire at the age of 55 are 
still valid. This means that these people must retire when they 
reach this age, not simultaneously but gradually as they reach 
the age of 55. Among the generals in question, two generals 
will become 55 in the first half of 1994, and the others will 
become 55 in the second half of 1994. I can also say after the 
government session that the changes affect various levels, both 
higher and lower levels. Mr. Kalman Lorincz, whom I would like 
to thank for his activity so far, also declared at the meeting 
that he had finished the task he received in 1989 and he would 
become 55 on 11 February 1994.

  [Text] Budapest, Jan 21 (AFP) -- Russian crude deliveries 
to Hungary on the Friendship pipeline resumed Friday [21 
January] following a two-and-a-half day break since Tuesday, 
officials of the state-owned Hungarian Oil and Gas Company (MOL) 
said. The supply break was due to administrative problems at 
Nafta, the Russian exporter, MOL said. 
  The break, which "was not the first example of a halt of 
supplies", did not affect work at Hungary's oil refineries and 
resulted only in rescheduling a 40,000-ton delivery to Hungary, 
the officials said. Last year, Hungary imported 5.1 million 
tonnes of crude from Russia and this year's imports were also 
planned to exceed five million tons, they said.

  Table I shows the order of parties among those people who 
said that they would definitely vote at elections "this Sunday" 
and who revealed which party they would vote for. As is shown, 
the MSZP, due to its stable and active voting base, is leading 
the list almost 10 percent ahead of the FIDESZ, whose voting 
base mainly consists of uncertain voters, and as a result of the 
events in the past few months, the stable voters and the 
representatives of this stratum are also turning away from the 
FIDESZ. The SZDSZ and the MDF are only following these two 
parties on the third and fourth place after a big gap.

  From time to time, we also show the antagonistic feelings 
against the parties, when people "definitely would not choose" a 
particular party (Table II). A significant change has taken 
place in this respect in the last month. The MDF, that has been 
slowly but surely rising on this list during the year to above 
30 percent, has now started to move downwards: It suddenly 
changed its position from the 29 percent in November to 20 
percent. 
  On the other hand, the MSZP that has been showing a very 
positive result -- some 3 percent -- for a long time can now 
claim a 7 percent level of dislike. 
  During the surveys, we also usually ask which party is 
likely 
to win at the parliamentary elections in the spring. Compared 
to November, there has not been any change in the order, the 
MSZP (20 percent) is continuing to lead with a considerable 
advantage, and it is followed by the FIDESZ (13 percent) and the 
SZDSZ (10 percent). However, the results of these three parties 
have decreased by 1 or 2 percent, and the percentage of those 
people who predict the MDF's victory, and of those who cannot 
answer the question, increased to the same extent. Considering 
that these changes are small and cannot yet be seen as trends, 
serious conclusions cannot be drawn from them. 
  The death of [former Prime Minister] Jozsef Antall coincided 
with our survey (we questioned 40 percent of the people before 
and 60 percent after this event). We cannot avoid asking if the 
death of the prime minister affected the party sympathies, and 
in what way. 
  According to our results, the fact that views on the MDF 
(and 
to a lesser extent, its coalition partners) changed is certainly 
closely related to Antall's death. 
  Up to 12 December, 5 percent (of all the surveyed people) 
would have voted on the MDF, and this changed to 8 percent 
afterwards. In the case of the KDNP and the FKGP, there is a 2 
to 3 percent decrease between these two periods. 
  On the scale of dislikes, the MDF had 24 percent before 12 
December and only 18 percent after this. The level of dislike 
of the FKGP increased by some 3 percent between the two periods. 
  On the list of parties that would be elected to Parliament, 
in the two periods, the MDF had 6 and 12 percent respectively, 
while the already low results of its coalition partners 
decreased by another 2 to 3 percent. 
  According to the survey, the results of the opposition 
parties did not change after the death of the prime minister. 
Therefore, we can conclude that the MDF increased its strength 
to the detriment of the other coalition parties, rather than 
that of the opposition parties. However, we will only be able 
to draw trends after assessing the party preferences in the 
coming months.

<F P=106> [Article by P.Sz.: "The Former Prime Minister's Several </F>
Hours' Long Talk With the Chairman of the MSZP--Miklos Nemeth Is 
Not Coming Home for the Spring Election"] 
  [Text] According to information received by our paper, 
Party [Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP)] Chairman Gyula Horn and 
former Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth held talks for two and a 
half hours on Monday in the Socialist Party's headquarters on 
Koztarsasag Square. The MSZP's three vice chairmen and the 
party's parliamentary group leader were also present at the 
consultation. According to our information, the discussion 
focused on finally clarifying the possibilities that exist in 
the event that Miklos Nemeth returns home. 
  Our paper was informed that Horn and Nemeth agreed to 
announce the former prime minister's decision shortly in a joint 
communique. In connection with the decision, we learned that 
Nemeth does not want to break the contract he has until 
1996--that is, he wants to stay on in the position of vice 
president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (EBRD) and will not return in the spring to take 
part in the Hungarian election campaign. 
  This finally puts an end to the uncertainty concerning the 
former government chief's acceptance of a political role at 
home, because, according to our information, we can also exclude 
any possibility of Nemeth's coming to Hungary after the 
elections and, depending on their outcome, filling a position 
offered to him. 
  It also became clear that Nemeth was not thinking of working 
out any kind of Christian-Socialist alternative and that, as far 
as he was concerned, only a possible invitation from the MSZP 
could have played a role.

<F P=106> [Article by J. Tibor Keri on statements made to him by </F>
Attila Zsigmond, Hungarian Democratic Forum deputy and chairman 
of the parliament's Cultural Committee: "Media Law Possible by 
Spring"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Attila Zsigmond (MDF [Hungarian 
Democratic Forum]) rejected opposition suggestions that passage 
of the media law is not in the government's interest. He 
announced that the government coalition indeed wanted and still 
wants the law to be created and that the government has a role 
to play in ending the parliament's negligence, which violates 
the Constitution. He added that the irregular situation that has 
developed in the media is not advantageous to anyone. 
  The chairman of the Cultural Committee said that the 
experts' 
draft of the media law is finished and that the ministries are 
now holding discussions on it to resolve their differences. 
Until conciliation is achieved, the draft cannot be submitted to 
the National Assembly. The chairman of the Cultural Committee 
asserted that he is confident that the government's 
recommendation will build on those elements of the draft law on 
which a consensus developed previously. He does not see any 
chance, however, for changing the so-called appointment law, 
which this parliament passed, or for "upgrading" the role of the 
Radio and Television Office. 
  According to Attila Zsigmond, if everything goes well, 
committee debate on the media draft law will start in February, 
and resolution of differences among the parties will be able to 
proceed concurrently. Zsigmond would particularly like to urge 
the latter. If political agreement can be reached, work on the 
law can speed up significantly, he added. In that case, the 
media law can be passed by the middle of April, the chairman of 
the Cultural Committee emphasized. 
  Zsigmond also asserted that a clean campaign does not depend 
on passage of the media law. What is absolutely necessary is a 
neutral stance on the part of journalists and honesty on the 
part of the political participants in the campaign. He added 
that now even those people who previously paid only lip service 
to passing the media law want it passed. Countless problems 
could have been avoided with television and radio if the media 
law had been passed before, he pointed out. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs welcomes 
the signing in Geneva of an understanding between the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia on relations 
between the two countries. 
  The Romanian Foreign Ministry issued a communique in which 
it 
expresses the belief that the positive development registered in 
the relations between the two countries represents an important 
and encouraging moment which will make a substantial 
contribution and provide an impetus to the peace process in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, reduce tension, and create conditions for a 
new consensus on coexistence in the area of the former 
Yugoslavia. 
  As a matter of fact, this moment is in line with the 
constant 
position promoted by Romania, which is to stimulate the process 
of normalizing relations between all countries that have emerged 
in the area of the former Yugoslavia and to hold talks between 
them. 
  The Romanian Foreign Ministry, reads the communique, 
expresses the hope that this process will continue and, thus, 
contribute to the promotion of political stability in this area 
and in the entire region.

<F P=106> [Report by Adrian Ursu on statements by Romanian Defense </F>
Minister Niculae Spiroiu: "Romania and NATO Processes; Closer to 
the Atlantic or Closer to Siberia?"] 
  [Text] The NATO summit held on 8 and 9 January in Brussels 
aroused interest both among the members of the alliance as well 
as among the countries in Central and Eastern Europe. Those 
countries are affected by the proposals of the Alliance made 
through the two documents (the invitation to cooperation and the 
basic document) that the aforementioned Alliance has adopted, 
through the "Partnership for Peace." 
  When the summit meeting was going through its official 
moments and cliches (starting with the group picture and ending 
with the publication of documents) we tried to examine this 
proposal and asked for the support and opinions of the Romanian 
defense minister, Lieutenant General Niculae Spiroiu. 
<H3>  What is the meaning of the partnership for peace and what 
does it offer us? </H3>
  "So far the partnership with NATO has taken place on the 
basis of the decision of the aforementioned alliance (since 
December 1991) in the form of a program with cooperation 
partners which included all the countries in Central and East 
Europe, that is, the former Warsaw Pact members, including the 
countries in the former USSR. We are talking here about a sort 
of collective partnership of the countries that participate in 
the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC). The partnership 
for peace represents a qualitatively superior stage, because we 
are no longer talking about collective relations but about 
bilateral relations between the Alliance and the countries for 
whom the partnership has been opened. Therefore, the 
partnership for peace implies certain amplified conditions 
compared with the form of cooperation that existed so far," said 
the Romanian defense minister. For the time being, concrete 
ways for this achievable military cooperation -- which also 
depends on the offer that each approached country will make -- 
could be the following: joint participation in operations aimed 
at peacekeeping or solving situations of crisis, joint military 
maneuvers, expansion of cooperation in the area of combat 
training, assistance granted for restructuring military bodies, 
and, maybe in the future, the procurement of military 
technology. Through this form of cooperation, the opportunities 
of the Alliance to participate in peacekeeping operations for 
example, would expand considerably. 
  Thus, as far as Romania is concerned, once the political 
decision for cooperation, which ends with integration in NATO, 
has been taken by the presidency, parliament, and the Ministry 
of Foreign affairs (as General Spiroiu stresses), the only thing 
left for Bucharest will be to present to the leadership of the 
alliance an proposition for cooperation, at least as attractive 
as the ones presented by the other countries that desire this 
integration. 
<H5>  Does this partnership contribute to good neighborliness? </H5>
  The insistence with which especially the countries included 
in the Visegrad group asked to be admitted to the Alliance as 
soon as possible, as well as the term of five years advanced 
more or less officially in Brussels as a period after which one 
could achieve the access, raises questions regarding conditions 
for admission. It is clear that NATO, as a body that aims to 
ensure its own security, is not tempted to incorporate sources 
of instability by accepting new members, no matter whether they 
are of an economic or of an ethnic nature. It is not very 
likely that the alliance would be used to resolve problems in 
the interests of one country or another. 
  "As far as the option of admitting new members is concerned, 
NATO will take into account the relations with their neighbors 
of those countries that it is going to admit. The alliance is 
certainly not willing to burden itself with problems of this 
nature, by accepting members that have problems. It is very 
likely that access will be granted to those countries that have 
no such problems" stressed the minister of defense. 
  Therefore, the Brussels documents require -- and analysts 
consider it absolutely necessary -- that a country that wishes 
to be admitted to NATO should offer a number of guarantees: to 
have a solid and viable economic basis, to present a convincing 
democratic process, to solve all their problems regarding ethnic 
minorities, to be ready to grant information regarding the 
budget and defense system, and last but not least, to 
subordinate the army to civilian society. 
<H5>  Is Romania Prepared for Such a Step? </H5>
  The reform of the Romanian Army and of the Ministry of 
Defense is a process desired by the country and to a great 
extent it has taken concrete shape. The process takes into 
account the need for the country's defense, the concluded 
military accords, and aims at achieving a structural 
compatibility with the Western military bodies, whose 
organization formula has already proven its viability. The 
access of civilians to the structures of the ministry up to the 
leadership body has already been implemented. 
  "The legislative framework has been worked out and, on the 
one hand it is in line with the standards of the legal bodies in 
the countries with a democratic tradition, and on the other 
hand, it is in accordance with the agreements concluded by 
Romania after the [1989] revolution. We have already elaborated 
the concept regarding the strategy of national security and the 
national military doctrine, following the same criteria." 
  "The reform process that we have started at the Ministry of 
National Defense is aimed at achieving a military organization 
similar to the structures in the West, especially in the 
countries that are members of the NATO and the Western European 
Union, because the structures that we want to achieve are 
acceptable both to NATO and Western European Union. We have 
taken action in the field of training programs, we have officers 
who are being trained in France, Britain, the United States, and 
Germany and we also made positive steps in the area of training 
methods. We carried out joint drills, especially in the Navy 
with the U.S. Navy, and the naval forces of Britain, France, 
Turkey, Bulgaria, and Greece. Although in the beginning the 
drills were of a smaller scale, they proved the compatibility of 
our soldiers' training with the training of soldiers in Western 
countries. The fact that we have credibility also proves the 
access to training programs such as IMET [expansion unknown] 
approved also by the U.S. Congress. The most difficult part is 
the army's equipment because of the economic recession. One 
might say that if we had money, this goal would be the easiest 
to achieve. In this respect we acted according to priorities, 
mainly because, in comparison with other armies of the former 
Warsaw Pact, our army's technological equipment was of Western 
origin. In our army, in case of every type of military vehicle 
(armored carriers and tanks) we have Western equipment. In the 
field of aviation we have Aero-Spatiale Turbomeca and Rolls 
Royce licenses. We are a little bit ahead of other countries. 
  In addition to this, we have already participated in 
peacekeeping operations in Somalia even on our own account. 
Currently, we are preparing the first Romanian battalion of 
"blue berets." I am optimistic in our possibility to align with 
criteria of the system proposed by the Brussels summit." 
  These are the preparations carried out by the Romanian Army 
to respond to the requirements of partnership, the way they have 
been presented by the minister of national defense. 
<H3>  What Would the Selective Access to the Structures of the 
Alliance Mean? "One or two years ago, the countries in the 
Visegrad group generated a competition as far as access to NATO 
is concerned. In this respect, there are two things we consider 
important: the first is that access of the countries in the 
region to the security structures, including NATO, should be 
carried out in such a way as to ensure equal security for all, 
without discrimination and without new frontiers. Thus, 
different levels of acceptance and discriminatory treatment 
would avoid new feelings of isolation, marginalization, 
distrust, and suspicion in this region. Second: any 
discrimination would belittle the standard required by this 
partnership for peace, even if this does not pleases the 
countries included in the Visegrad group. The partnership for 
peace is above any discrimination. In addition, it is important 
that access to security structures should not appear as an 
action aimed against Russia. It is important that Russia should 
not be pushed aside from these structures and that it should be 
assisted in this process of democratization of political life as 
well as in the military area. The NATO in which we wish to be 
integrated is not the same NATO that existed at the time of the 
cold war but an organization that has proved its ability to 
develop a new aspect of its activities, namely to support 
democratic processes and the democratic transition of military 
bodies" said General Spiroiu. </H3>
  If the Alliance offered guarantees of security to the four 
countries that belong to the Visegrad group, it would put 
Romania in a position not to be able to plead its cause directly 
within this structure. For the time being, however, it appears 
that no decision has been taken regarding access -- selective or 
not -- to NATO structures. Romania's geostrategic position, its 
demographic and economic potential, its control over the mouth 
of the Danube, and thus over a waterway that will become 
extremely important in the future, that is, the 
Rhine-Main-Danube canal, the connection that it can ensure 
Romania with the Southeast "region" of NATO [Greece and Turkey) 
and with the Middle East, all these elements make our country 
interesting and important. But not only for NATO.

  [Text] During our radio program today entitled "Live 
Contact With Our Listeners," Teodor Melescanu, state and foreign 
affairs minister, answered a number of questions regarding the 
foreseeable chances for Romania's international policy in 1994. 
  Commenting on our security, which is ensured by the 
Partnership for Peace plan, the head of Romanian diplomacy said 
that the guarantees offered by that initiative, combined with 
the international bodies that Romania is gradually joining, as 
well as the opening up of our society for investments from West 
Europe and other regions, will result in the establishment of a 
network of contacts and solidarity that is necessary so that 
political and security promises do not remain merely promises. 
  One of the principal changes that occurred in our diplomacy 
after December 1989, Melescanu said, is that our foreign policy 
no longer follows the political color of our partners; 
therefore, our relations with various countries are based on a 
principle that is totally separated from ideology. The PRC 
represents one of our most important partners, both economically 
and on the level of dialogue maintained with Chinese officials. 
China is one of the permanent members of the UN Security 
Council and a country that could offer essential help to Romania 
at any time, which is something we never forget, Romania's 
foreign affairs minister said. 
  For Romania's diplomacy, we hope that 1994 will be the year 
of Asia -- that is, a year in which our relations with Asian 
countries are developed extensively. 
  Regarding the annulling of the consequences of the 
Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact [concluded in 1940, when Romania lost 
Bessarabia and Bucovina to the Soviet Union], Romania has made 
and is making sustained efforts so that the juridical effects 
and the territorial consequences for the Romanian population 
should be annulled. It is just a matter of time, Melescanu 
said, since the problem will be solved as democracy develops in 
our country and in other neighboring countries, and a European 
system will be established based on the fundamental values of 
democracy and legality. 
  During the program, the head of Romanian diplomacy also 
referred to the efforts being made to recover the Romanian 
treasure from the Russians, one of the main issues tackled 
during negotiations with the Russian Federation. Melescanu 
pointed out that the Russian authorities officially admitted 
that the Romanian state treasure had been transferred to Russia. 
Negotiations are currently under way to clear up the status of 
the treasure. A Russian delegation will arrive in Bucharest 
next month to hold talks and appraise the treasure.

<F P=106> [Virgil Lazar report: "The Gypsies Threaten Reprisals"] </F>
  [Text] The Cluj city branch of the Caritas 
money-multiplying society [Ponzi scheme] has again moved its 
headquarters to the building of the Mining Institute situated on 
Tudor Vladimirescu street in the village of Baciu. According to 
the rumors, the headquarters was moved hastily to that building 
on the outskirts of Cluj because of the danger of a conflict 
with ethnic Gypsies who have invested money in the scheme but 
have not been paid their dues on time. A few days ago a group 
of Gypsies, who had driven all the way from Suceava, caused a 
disturbance in the center of Cluj, where the Caritas 
headquarters had temporarily moved to, namely in the building of 
the daily MESAGERUL TRANSILVAN, a paper that advertises Caritas 
and publishes its notices and lists of winners. 
  Furthermore, the same sources within Caritas have disclosed 
that last week the leader of the ethnic Gypsies, Emperor Iulian 
of Sibiu, had personally come to Cluj to talk to Gheorghe Stoica 
[founder and owner of Caritas]. Unable to meet Stoica, Iulian 
became infuriated and threatened to return later to Caritas at 
the head of an army of 30,000 Gypsies if Stoica does not make 
the payments that he has pledged. 
  Meanwhile in Cluj, certain supporters of Caritas have been 
circulating all kinds of rumors, even by means of the local 
newspapers, claiming that all the participants in the scheme 
will experience a miracle. That lie was so exaggerated that Mr. 
Stoica himself felt compelled to issue a communique in MESAGERUL 
TRANSILVAN, saying that solely the news published by that paper 
may be considered accurate. That is, he indirectly rejected the 
rumors that had been circulated by the Pro Caritas Foundation 
with the purpose of tempering the anger of the deceived 
participants in the scheme. 
  Apart from this, the lists of the winners have become rather 
short. Currently they are paying out the winnings of investors 
whose names begin with the letters P and R, and who paid in 
their money on 5 July. Meanwhile the selling of Caritas slips 
continues in Cluj, as many investors believe that there are a 
sufficient number of people naive enough to pay cash for 
winnings that are uncertain. Here are some examples selected 
from the MESAGERUL TRANSILVAN: "Offer: 50 Cluj Caritas 
receipts dated 11 and 19 July in exchange for a bachelor flat." 
Or: "Will exchange 500 Caritas receipts dated September for a 
one- to three-bedroom apartment or individual house," and so on. 
And finally, here is a question that is typical of how Caritas 
makes its payments: "We ask the leadership of Caritas to clear 
up how they intend to pay the winnings of the investors who paid 
in their money on 3 July and who have been skipped over during 
recent payments." That is a good question: What happens to all 
those who have been skipped over, even though their payments are 
long overdue?!

Received by Leading Representatives of the Slovak Republic"] 
  [Excerpts] Bratislava -- [passage omitted] Slovak 
Parliament Chairman Ivan Gasparovic received Miguel Angel 
Martinez, president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council 
of Europe, in the early evening yesterday. Their talks 
concerned primarily aspects of human and civic rights of 
individuals and national communities, the ratification of the 
Slovak Republic's agreement on association with the European 
Union [EU] by the parliaments of EU member states, and the 
Partnership for Peace project. [passage omitted] 
  At a briefing held after the meeting, Miguel Angel Martinez 
reiterated his conviction that Slovakia is a country respecting 
the freedom of citizens and their right of assembly. The 
Komarno rally [of representatives of the Hungarian minority on 8 
January 1994] is a proof of this. Ivan Gasparovic stressed the 
fact that M.A. Martinez had declared his visit as a working trip 
to one of the member countries of the Council of Europe and not 
as an inspection. 
  The highest representative of the National Council of the 
Slovak Republic briefed his guest about the territorial and 
administrative division of Slovakia currently under preparation 
and about Slovakia's rejection of the [Hungarian minority 
representatives'] project of the country's division on the basis 
of the ethnic principle. He also spoke with him about planned 
legislation addressing the issue of designating the names of 
communities in the language of ethnic minorities and the writing 
of their names and surnames. The president of the Parliamentary 
Assembly of the Council of Europe showed understanding for this 
approach. [passage omitted] 
  Later in the evening, at the end of the first day of the 
Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly delegation's stay in 
Slovakia, Miguel Angel Martinez was received by Slovak Prime 
Minister Vladimir Meciar.

  [Excerpts] Representatives of minorities living in Hungary 
met at a roundtable in order to discuss the last opportunity to 
gain entry into the National Assembly. The recently approved 
electoral law does not give this opportunity to members of 
national minorities in Hungary. Our correspondent Gregor Martin 
Papucek reports from Budapest: 
  [Begin Papucek recording] The consultative body--also called 
a minority roundtable--of 13 enthnic groups who enjoy minority 
status in Hungary decided at its meeting in Budapest today to 
make a last attempt to resolve the question of direct and 
independent representation of minorities in the parliament. 
Michal Mata, the executive chairman of the Union of Slovaks in 
Hungary, who was present at the meeting, told me that the 
participants in the roundtable no longer nurtured high hopes. 
Nonetheless, they will write a letter to the president, prime 
minister, and the parliamentary speaker. They will also ask a 
parliamentary deputy to open up the whole problem again in the 
National Assembly and convey views and proposals of the 
representatives of the minorities. [passage omitted] 
  The minorities roundtable will thus make another attempt to 
engage in talks with representatives of parliamentary parties. 
It makes no secret of the fact that it wants to lobby in order 
to change the current electoral law. If this endeavor brings no 
results the minorities are prepared to appeal to international 
institutions. This is the united view of all participants in 
the roundtable. True, they would prefer the issue to be 
resolved at home. But as Michal Mata told me, the minorities 
roundtable is not willing to accept any solution other then a 
direct and independent representation of national and ethnic 
groups in the parliament. Thus some kind of a council for 
minorities or an ombudsman especially for minorities issues does 
not come into consideration. This would amount to very little. 
Such attempts at seeking a solution outside of parliament have 
recently gained strength in political circles. [end recording]

  [Text] Bratislava -- In connection with activities carried 
out by the Association of Zitny Ostrov [Rye Island, 
Hungarian-inhabited area in southern Slovakia] Towns and 
Villages [ZMOZO] on 27 December 1993, the Ministry of Interior 
of the Slovak Republic sent a letter to ZMOZO Chairman Stefan 
Pasztor, in which, acting in accordance with Article 12, 
paragraph 3 of law No. 83 of 1990, it points out that the aims 
and tasks of the association as contained in the ZMOZO appeal of 
6 December 1993 are not compatible with its program and 
statutes. This is stated in a letter addressed by the General 
Prosecutor's Office of the Slovak Republic to Ivan Duris, 
chairman of the Republican Party of the Slovak Republic, 
yesterday, in reply to his request that this institution 
investigate ZMOZO's activities. 
  In the event that the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak 
Republic ascertains that the association is engaged in 
activities reserved for political parties and movements and 
violate principles contained in Article 3, paragraphs 1 and 2 of 
law No. 38 of 1990 or that run counter to Articles 4 or 5 of law 
No. 83 of 1990, it will take measures within the framework of 
its powers arising from provisions of Article 12, paragraph 3, 
letter c) of the aforementioned law, the letter from the General

<F P=106> [Report by Jan Skoda: "Waiting Not for Water but for the </F>
Government"] 
  [Excerpts] On Monday [17 January], Hungary presented to 
the European Union [EU] headquarters in Brussels its official 
response to the EU experts' recommendation concerning the 
division of Danube water at Gabcikovo. This was announced by 
Gyorgy Tatar, Hungarian ministerial commissioner [title as 
published] for the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros hydroelectric power 
project. Tatar stated in the Hungarian daily NEPSZABADSAG that, 
while Hungary submitted its response by the EU's deadline, the 
same allegedly cannot be said of Slovakia. 
  We have, therefore, contacted the Slovak mission at the EU 
headquarters in Brussels and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 
Bratislava. They confirmed to us that, in a letter at the 
beginning of the year, Jan Lisuch, state secretary at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, asked EU mediator Pablo Benavidez 
to extend the original 15 January deadline, set for the 
Hungarian and Slovak sides to submit their responses, until the 
end of the month. He explained this request by the fact that 
the Slovak Government has been unable to discuss its standpoint 
so far. The standpoint had been prepared several times, but it 
was necessary to incorporate into it comments from individual 
government departments, which has delayed the whole process. 
According to Vladimir Cemez, PhD, from the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, the response was to be on the agenda of yesterday's 
meeting of the Slovak Government. According to our information, 
however, this did not happen. [passage omitted] 
  Hungary is now accusing us that a month and a half was not 
enough for us to assume a position on the EU's recommendation 
concerning the temporary division of Danube waters. Gyorgy 
Tatar claims, moreover, that the Slovak attitude actually 
confirms our negative stand on the EU recommendation, which, 
according to Hungarian newspapers, proposes that 40 percent of 
the Danube water remain in the river's original bed and that 
Budapest build two small dams on its territory. 
  In this affair, which may seem immaterial, we are, thus, 
once 
again in the position of the "evil" side that does not honor its 
commitments. Without trying to act as a judge, let us only 
observe that, this time, this is absolutely unnecessary.

<F P=106> [Article by Roman Hofbauer, minister of transportation, </F>
communications, and public works: "The Storm's Distant Thunder; 
Dawns and Dusks of Year 1" -- "abridged" article published in 
the weekly SLOVENSKE NARODNE NOVINY, date not given] 
  [Text] On 17 September 1993 at 0830, the telefax at the 
Secretariat of the Ministry of Transportation, Communications, 
and Public Works started to churn out a report from an overseas 
sender. Initially, I had doubts and thought that the document 
might be a forgery. Unfortunately, however, the material was 
authentic and its contents deserved attention, because of its 
quite peculiar orientation. It was a report by the U.S. 
Congress Helsinki Commission for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe, [prepared] under the auspices of liaison officer Erika 
B. Schlager. The text of the report deserves to be published in 
full, not only to document the present, but also for the sake of 
history. It documents the concerns of U.S. senators who are, at 
the same time, leading representatives of the U.S. Commission 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Their concern about 
freedom and democracy in the state between the Danube river and 
the Tatra mountains is all the more remarkable as they probably 
never set foot on its territory, which ordinary Americans mostly 
confuse with Slovenia or Croatia and which they place somewhere 
in the Balkans. 
  The full text of the report follows: 
<H6>  CSCE PRESS REPORT </H6>
<H6>  COMMISSION FOR SECURITYAND COOPERATION IN EUROPE </H6>
  For immediate circulation 
  Liaison: Erika B. Schlager 
  Washington 9 September 1993. Senator Dennis De Concini 
(Democrat - Arizona) and Representative Steny H. Hoyer (Democrat 
-- Maryland), chairman and deputy chairman of the Helsinki 
Commission, have sent the following letter to Peter Burian, 
charge d'affaires at the Slovak Embassy in Washington: 
  ``We feel obliged to voice our concern regarding Slovakia's 
continued intolerance for non-Slovak ethnic and religious 
communities, as reported in the press. In word and deed, 
Slovakia's officials have raised serious doubts about the 
state's willingness to observe human rights commitments 
voluntarily accepted by the new state as part of the Helsinki 
process. The acts and statements of several Slovak government 
officials not only give grounds for warranted apprehension about 
the security of minorities in Slovakia, but also about the 
prospects of democracy itself. 
  ``For example, the highest officials of the present 
government -- including Prime Minister Meciar and Minister of 
Culture Dusan Slobodnik -- have repeatedly warned that those who 
`slander' the Slovak state or disseminate `erroneous 
information' about it, or are not `objective' in their reports, 
should be punished or subjected to control. This intimidation 
is reminiscent of the legal situation under communism, such as 
the well-known ban on `anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda' in 
the Soviet Union. Moreover, by systematically defaming the 
press, Slovak representatives have taken steps, the clear result 
of which is the stifling of freedom of speech. In this context, 
the political use of the state subsidies system in converting 
the Slovak economy to a market economy comes to our mind 
[sentence as published]. 
  ``Moreover, as we have noticed, the general approach of 
intolerance is being stepped up. In the course of the last few 
weeks, Slovak Minister of Transportation Roman Hofbauer started 
a campaign to render impossible the use of the Hungarian 
language in traffic signs throughout the state territory. 
Leaving aside questions concerning the economic justifiability 
of expenditures, this uncompromisingly controlled and highly 
centralized manner of governing does not heed the interests of 
local communities. This runs counter to specific commitments 
undertaken by the Slovak Government upon admission to the 
Council of Europe and the general assurances made by Prime 
Minister Meciar to Congressman Tom Lantos this spring about a 
just approach to minority communities. 
  ``This week we have heard further disquieting reports. 
First, it has been announced that, in his speech at Spisska 
Nova Ves, Prime Minister Meciar warned against the high birth 
rate in the Romany (Gypsy) community, claiming that `if we are 
not going to deal with them, after a while they will deal with 
us. We must perceive them as a problematic group that is 
constantly growing.' In the light of Slovak deportations of 
Romanies to death camps during World War II and the forced 
sterilization of Romany women under the postwar communist 
regime, these are shocking statements. They are also in sharp 
contrast to Slovakia's commitment, adopted at the CSCE forum in 
Copenhagen in 1990 and approved by the Slovak Government in 
January 1993, `to clearly and unambiguously condemn 
totalitarianism, racism and ethnic hatred, anti-Semitism, 
xenophobia, and any discrimination, as well as persecution for 
religious and ideological beliefs. In this context the 
participating states also acknowledge the special problems of 
Romanies (Gypsies).' 
  ``It has also been announced that a U.S. citizen serving in 
the Slovak Jewish community -- Rabbi Baruch Myers -- was 
assaulted in Bratislava this week. Apparently, the manner of 
public pronouncements by representatives of the Slovak 
Government about the problems of minorities in the course of 
last year might have contributed to an atmosphere that is 
conducive to official indifference to racially-motivated 
attacks, or even to their toleration. In sum, this development 
has seriously disrupted confidence in the process of Slovak 
conversion to democracy. 
  ``The CSCE will meet in Warsaw in a few weeks to discuss 
human rights, including questions of CSCE member states' 
observance of their commitments. We would welcome by then any 
supplementary information on the problems we have outlined.'' 
<H5>  Cowardly Slovak Charge d'Affaires </H5>
  Since the authors of the letter and the report, and 
exponents 
of the views expounded in them, expressed their interest in any 
further information on their assertions (concerns?!), which they 
would welcome, a prompt and businesslike reaction was to be 
expected from those to whom these alleged problems, which are 
actually accusations, were addressed. 
  The first reaction came from the Slovak charge d'affaires in 
Washington (not from our ambassador because, after nine months 
of existence as an independent state, our republic still does 
not have an appointed ambassador in the world's foremost 
superpower). This reaction to the assertions raised was more 
than cowardly. He expressed the view that realities in the 
Slovak Republic were not as bad as presented in the senators' 
viewpoint or as they appear to be, and that intolerance or 
anti-Semitism occur, as they do also in other states. Well, the 
reaction to the senators' letter, to such grievous accusations 
-- accusations, not concerns! -- of our state, our government, 
and our supreme constitutional officials was neither fish nor 
fowl and almost apologetic. The worldwide dissemination of a 
written statement by senior senators of the CSCE committee on 
the eve of the drafting and the discussion of a final CSCE 
report on human rights in Warsaw and the naming of [Slovak] 
constitutional representatives in connection with untrue 
assertions extracted from one-sided information sources -- that 
has nothing to do with concerns! The diplomatic vocabulary and 
the diplomatic code have established very precise rules in this 
regard. 
<H5>  Silent Foreign Ministry </H5>
  The staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the 
sovereign 
and freely and democratically established Slovak Republic 
considered the whole matter settled with the Washington charge 
d'affaires' statement. So it seems, at least, for the ministry 
itself did not react at all. 
  I do not like it when anyone associates me, as a member of 
the Slovak Government, with alleged permanent Slovak 
intolerance, suppression of freedom of speech, ban on the use of 
the Hungarian language, deportation of Romanies to death camps, 
the forceful sterilization of Romany women, or even toleration 
of racially motivated attacks in Slovakia. I therefore assumed 
a clear and unequivocal stand on all points in the report. 
  For the sake of documenting the present for the future, I 
consider it warranted to acquaint the public with my reaction. 
It is uncommon in the world of diplomacy to make such 
correspondence public but, in doing so, I am only following in 
the steps of the U.S. senators, whose action went beyond the 
framework of diplomatic fairness. 
<H5>  My Reaction to the Congressmen's Report </H5>
  ``In connection with the report of Senator Dennis D. Concini 
(Democrat -- Arizona) and Representative Steny H. Hoyer 
(Democrat -- Maryland) of 13 September 1993, intended for the 
CSCE, in which the two gentlemen express their apprehensions 
about Slovakia's alleged continuous intolerance of non-Slovak 
ethnic and religious communities, about alleged punishment and 
control of the press with the alleged aim of stifling freedom of 
the press, about the transportation minister's alleged campaign 
to render impossible the usage of the Hungarian language, about 
Prime Minister Meciar's alleged statements directed against the 
Romany ethnic group, or about the allegedly racially-motivated 
assault on Rabbi Baruch Myers, a U.S. citizen serving in the 
Slovak religious community -- I consider it unavoidable to 
inform you about the following: 
  ``1. I think it is deplorable that the aforementioned 
gentlemen assume a stand on a state, the existence of which they 
are aware only on the basis of tendentious and distorted 
arbitrary information. It would be extremely beneficial if they 
visited our country personally, to confront their apprehensions 
directly with the persons they mention in their report. This 
would be the easiest way to convince them that their 
apprehensions are based on arbitrary disinformation. 
  ``2. The Constitution and the entire state legal framework 
establish scope for a democratic and free society, to which 
intolerance of non-Slovak ethnic groups and religious 
communities is alien. The Slovak Republic is the only European 
post-communist country that has thoroughly redressed the wrongs 
of the past that were committed against all churches. This 
redress of wrongs is based on a return to the situation prior to 
1948 (communist coup) or 1945. The Jewish religious community 
constitutes the only exception; the starting point for 
redressing the wrongs committed against it is 2 November 1938, 
that is, the date of the occupation of southern Slovakia by 
fascist Horthyite Hungary in the wake of the Vienna arbitrage. 
Your assertions about Slovakia's continued intolerance are 
completely false. 
  ``3. In respecting the freedom of the press, the government 
is basing its policy on Council of Europe Resolution 1003 of 1 
July 1993 on journalistic ethics. I am enclosing the text of 
this resolution. Unlike journalists in advanced democratic 
countries, some representatives of our press confuse reports 
with commentaries, facts with hypotheses, arguments with 
opinions, and comprehensive information with excerpts torn out 
of context. I am of the opinion that the Council of Europe 
recommendations concerning this issue are warranted and correct. 
I hope that you are of the same opinion. 
  ``No one in the government can control the press because in 
Slovakia there is no censorship. If, however, journalists are 
authors of damaging lies, it is possible to seek legal recourse 
in conformity with valid laws. Judicial power is independent of 
the state in our country. The realization of such steps has 
nothing to do with suppressing the freedom of the press but is a 
normal legal mechanism of a democratic state, such as is applied 
also in other free and democratic states of the world. 
  ``4. Statements about the `extermination' of the Hungarian 
language from Ministry of Transportation road signs are grossly 
distorted. In every state there is an established legal 
framework for traffic signs that cannot be changed at will and 
arbitrarily on the basis of the views of a certain ethnic 
community. If such a situation were common in all states, it 
would lead to organizational chaos in traffic signs. Even in 
the United States there is a large number of traffic signs with 
inscriptions, and I did not notice languages of other nations 
being used on them. If my observations were inaccurate, I would 
welcome more specific details from your side. 
  ``5. Prime Minister Meciar's alleged statements about the 
Romany community were apparently gleaned from the Czech news 
agency CTK. Its journalist [Karel] Hirman put into Prime 
Minister Meciar's mouth words that he did not utter. Because 
slander of this kind is criminally liable in civilized and 
democratic states, the prosecuting authorities have initiated 
proceedings against him. 
  ``6. The physical assault on Rabbi Baruch Myers of the 
Jewish community was connected with the deplorable growth in 
crime in the wake of the opening up of society and had nothing 
to do with racial motives. The offenders were three juveniles 
who stole Mr. Baruch Myers' characteristic black hat. They were 
detained still on the day of the theft and the stolen object was 
returned to its owner. 
  ``I consider it extremely unfortunate that our state is 
assessed by persons who have never been in our country and on 
the basis of out of context information. Such a course of 
action cannot be positively received, also in view of the 
methods that had been applied against our country until recently 
and that we thought were a matter of the past since 1989.'' 

<H5>    Assurance That Was Not Kept </H5>
  My reaction went to Eleonor Sutter, U.S. charge d'affaires 
in 
Bratislava, Senators Steny H. Hoyer and Dennis De Concini, the 
Slovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Slovak American 
National Council in the United States. 
  After the intervention of the chairman of the National 
Council of the Slovak Republic [Ivan Gasparovic] with those who 
prepared the report in the United States, the Slovak side was 
assured that, in view of the Slovak side's objections, the 
report would not be published. This was presently disavowed, as 
confirmed also by the commission's assistant Erika B. Schlager, 
and the report was widely distributed to the public. Can it be 
considered a coincidence that this happened immediately before 
our talks with the World Bank? 
  One can calmly reason that this is quite an effective point 
of departure for levying financial and economic sanctions 
against a country that has been questioned in this way. 
Sufficient scope is created for intervention by UN troops, with 
massive participation by the Marines, in the interest of 
protecting human rights and combating racism. Scope is created 
for the materialization of the intention to peacefully alter 
borders in Central Europe on the basis of arbitrage by the world 
powers. He who does not believe this, let him study the U.S. 
Congress Helsinki Commission's report about Slovakia to realize 
where it is necessary to intervene against evil, in the interest 
of the good. The world powers did this twice before, at the 
international arbitrages in Munich and Vienna [in September and 
November 1938], for the sake of saving peace and calm and in the 
interest of addressing the situation of minorities deprived of 
their rights. After their "remedial" steps, millions of Czechs 
and hundreds of thousands of Slovaks found themselves in the 
position of minorities without rights in Germany and Hungary. 
Instead of the longed-for peace, the war broke out! 
<H5>  Mrs. Schlager's Sources of Information </H5>
  I am of the opinion that it is appropriate to stop for a 
while to consider a matter of principle -- the sources of 
information about the Slovak Republic on which documents of this 
kind draw, and to which they refer. In an interview for Radio 
Free Europe, Erika B. Schlager said that members of the U.S. 
Congress Helsinki Commission are responsible for the preparation 
of the aforementioned report. 
  According to Erika Schlager's information, staffers of 
various U.S. Congress offices travelled to Slovakia and their 
reports served as a point of departure in preparing the 
aforementioned document. Hence, this is not the viewpoint of 
private persons but a document expressing views that are close 
to the U.S. Administration. The report on Slovakia also draws 
on materials sent by various people directly from Slovakia, 
materials of unofficial institutions in the United States which 
monitor developments in Slovakia, and many articles from various 
Slovak newspapers and magazines. Mrs. Schlager, who was in 
Slovakia twice, in 1990 and 1992 (!!!), states that the view 
that the report's section on minorities is based on clippings 
from the Hungarian press is not quite accurate. 
  There is really nothing to be added to this, except, 
perhaps, 
for one thing: It suffices to attentively study the senators' 
letter and the "apprehensions" concerning democracy and freedom 
in Slovakia expressed in it, to very easily identify the press 
sources of such reports from Slovakia. These are newspapers 
that given their print run, the number of unsold issues, and 
attained economic results, should have theoretically gone 
bankrupt and perished a long time ago. In spite of that, these 
newspapers are prospering, evidently not from their own 
resources. It is being said in some circles that the pay of 
some of their reporters, who dip their pen in venom and spread 
untruths about Slovakia, reaches four digits and not in korunas, 
as everyone knows.... 
  Nothing happens of its own accord, without a cause. Let us 
identify the aims of this escalated anti-Slovak crusade and we 
will come to understand the steps being prepared and realized 
and, in particular, their purpose. Let us assert our interests, 
our needs, and our plans. 
  Only, let us do this quickly, effectively, and vigorously. 
  Our ill-wishers are doing it too! 
  Current developments within the state and abroad signal the 
warranted risk that the Slovak Republic may not live to see the 
second anniversary of its independence. It should, and 
definitely will, live to see it, however! And not just the 
second anniversary but countless further anniversaries, within 
the framework of the broad family of sovereign European national 
republics. 
  No nation in the world is better off under foreign rule, no 
matter what foreign rule this is, than when it decides on its 
affairs itself. 
  Well, then: Shall we let ourselves be intimidated, 
perturbed, divided, and corrupted?! Shall we allow the social 
atmosphere to be poisoned by ill-wishers who are full of hatred 
and who, not infrequently, wage a struggle for foreign interests 
and aims for foreign money? 
  Or shall we confirm the continuation, along our own path, 
into our own promised land? After all, the results achieved in 
the brief period of the first year of our statehood are far more 
favorable than expected by any world political scientists, 
economic experts, and forecasters. We are also facing 
considerable problems, which is understandable. We are building 
and furnishing the home of our own statehood in conditions of a 
deep worldwide economic recession. But just as bad weather can 
only improve after some time, depression can only be followed by 
prosperity. We are not going to achieve it in a month or two. 
We are going to make it, however, provided all of us will 
really want it! 
  The decision is in our hands and our decisions will affect 
many generations of our children's children. Let our decisions 
be wise.

  [Text] Within the framework of reducing debts owed to 
Slovakia by the former Soviet Union, Slovakia will purchase 
military equipment in Russia to the tune of between $80 and $90 
million. This was stated by Igor Urban, state secretary of the 
Slovak Defense Ministry, following his talks with Russian 
officials in Moscow. According to him, experts from both 
countries will discuss in the weeks to follow the precise amount 
and kind of equipment to be purchased. Igor Urban, who signed a 
plan for military cooperation between the Slovak and Russian 
Defense Ministries in Moscow today, remarked that at issue was 
equipment that the Slovak Armed Forces will use in the current 
year.

<F P=106> [Report by Engineer Okaliova: "Expectations and Reality; </F>
Citizens' Views on Developments After 17 November 1989"] 
  [Text] "Have your expectations regarding the development of 
our society after 17 November 1989 been fulfilled or not?" In 
December 1993, the Slovak Statistical Office put this question 
to 1,272 respondents representative of the adult population of 
Slovakia in terms of sex, age, nationality, education, size of 
community of residence, and geographical part of Slovakia. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Respondent's expectations             |Percent                               | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Have mostly been fulfilled            |4                                     | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Some have been fulfilled, some not    |22                                    | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Have mostly not been fulfilled        |44                                    | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Did not have any expectations         |26                                    | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Do not know                           |4                                     | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  A look at the structure of the sample of respondents 
regarding replies to individual questions shows that the most 
satisfied with developments in our society after 17 November 
1989 (that is, those whose expectations have been fulfilled for 
the most part, or at least partially) are those sympathetic 
toward the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (45 percent) and 
respondents in the 40-49 (32 percent) and 18-24 (31 percent) age 
groups. The relatively most disappointed with the post-November 
developments are citizens who are currently unemployed (61 
percent) and those who do not sympathize with any political 
party or movement (51 percent). 
  No expectations regarding the development of society were 
harbored, in particular, by citizens showing sympathy for the 
Party of the Democratic Left (32 percent). 
  The respondents were asked, furthermore, to reply 
spontaneously -- that is, without any possible replies being 
indicated -- in what specifically their expectations have or 
have not been fulfilled. Among the most frequently cited 
positive replies were the feeling of greater freedom and 
democracy in general (8 percent), as well as the freedom of 
movement and the possibility to travel. The freedom of 
enterprise and the possibility of self-realization were cited by 
7 percent of respondents. Negative replies were more frequent, 
particularly those referring to the lack of an improvement in 
the living standards of the population (30 percent), in the 
economy (12 percent), in the sphere of political life (10 
percent), and in unemployment (10 percent). A general turn for 
the worse was noted by 16 percent of respondents. 
  In view of the fact that the smallest number of fulfilled 
expectations was in the sphere of the economy and living 
standards, citizens were asked to deliver their opinion on tasks 
in the economic sphere. In the respondents' view, in the 
interest of economic recovery the government should, above all, 
draft a comprehensive concept of economic policy (38 percent), 
support small and medium-sized businessmen by means of tax cuts 
(24 percent), extend financial benefits to employers creating 
new jobs (23 percent), support the development of 
future-oriented branches (20 percent), support the creation of 
socially useful jobs and the organization of work beneficial to 
the public (17 percent), and create suitable conditions for the 
influx of foreign capital (16 percent). 
  The completion of large-scale privatization figured last 
among the required measures, with 9 percent of respondents 
noting the necessity of completing it by means of the coupon 
method and 6 percent by means of standard privatization methods.

<TEXT>
Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] A major Slovak daily has suggested that 
Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar and Deputy Prime Minister (and 
Finance Minister) Julius Toth, through their leading positions 
in the Fund for National Property (FFNP), have been trying to 
replace the managers of large industrial enterprises with 
stalwart supporters of their own party, the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). In an article entitled "Meciar's and 
Toth's Personal War With the Giants: Who Covets Economic Power 
in the State?," the editors of the independent SLOVENSKY VYCHOD 
asked, "Could it be that...the HZDS wants to install `its own 
men' at the highest management level in these enterprises," 
replacing managers who "are not completely loyal" to Meciar? The 
paper goes on to suggest that the prime minister and the finance 
minister had "other than populist" reasons for trying to deal 
with the management shortage that besets many of the large 
Slovak industrial enterprises. 
  "It is generally known," says the 20 December issue of the 
Kosice daily, that "the Slovak economy was not (and could not 
have been) prepared, particularly at the managerial level, for 
the developments that followed November 1989. There are simply 
not enough experienced people around, with high professional 
qualifications, capable of coping with contemporary challenges." 
While the government has for some time been looking for a way 
out of the situation, the HZDS immediately after its 1992 
election victory "prepared a plan for carrying out its personnel 
policies." This plan, according to the daily, "extended 
practically to all levels of Slovak society--from top to bottom, 
from Bratislava to the last district town, and from there down 
to all kinds of individual offices, including even cultural and 
sport offices." The paper claims that Meciar, who is not only 
the prime minister but also the minister of privatization and 
administration of national property and chairman of the 
Presidium of the FFNP, along with Toth, who is not only deputy 
prime minister but also minister of finance and chairman of the 
Supervisory Board of the FFNP, have recently taken a direct hand 
in "preparing personnel changes in 21 large enterprises in which 
the FFNP holds, as a percentage of the whole, an important 
number of shares." 
  "Why," asks the daily, "do V. Meciar and J. Toth want to go 
through with these fundamental personnel changes with such 
haste--as early as the beginning of January 1994? Why are they 
calling for extraordinary general meetings and changes in the 
bylaws?" After all, declares SLOVENSKY VYCHOD, "such a quick 
job" cannot lead to the desired stabilization and invigoration 
of Slovak industry and can only produce "a shock that will bring 
about more insecurity" in an economy that is "already short on 
stability."

  [Text] Belgrade, Jan 23 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslavia on Monday 
[24 January] launches a programme of economic recovery and 
reconstruction of the monetary system, Deputy Prime Minister 
Jovan Zebic said on Sunday. Zebic said the government on Sunday 
adopted the last in a series of measures necessary for launching 
the economic reform programme which would primarily focus on 
curbing hyperinflation. The programme for slashing the monster 
inflation whose monthly rate reached one million percent last 
December starts with the issuing of the new convertible dinar 
with 100-percent gold and hard currency backing. 
  Other measures include a radical reduction of the primary 
issue and an increase in production geared for the market made 
almost non-existent after many companies withdrew their products 
from the market because of hyperinflation. 
  Economic expert Dragoslav Avramovic, the chief architect of 
Yugoslavia's stabilization programme, said that the package did 
not envisage wage or price freezes and that the state could opt 
for such measures only in a very limited number of cases.

  [Text] Belgrade, 21 Jan (TANJUG) -- The Federal Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs today expressed concern in connection with the 
recent arrest and expulsion of two priests of the Serbian 
Orthodox Church from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. 
The priests were accused of having "conducted religious rites 
in several villages in the municipality of Kumanovo without the 
permission of the Macedonian Orthodox Church and the Macedonian 
Ministry of Internal Affairs, and thus instigated national 
hatred and intolerance." 
  Recalling that this is not the first occasion on which the 
authorities of the former Yugoslav republic have shown 
intolerance toward the clergy of the Serbian Orthodox Church, 
the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs stresses that by such 
behavior Skopje is depriving the Serbian people living in 
Macedonia of their religious rights. This is in contravention 
of international norms and documents that the Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia has accepted, the statement, which was 
forwarded to TANJUG today, goes on to say. 
  "This incites an atmosphere of insecurity and fear among the 
Serbs in Macedonia, whose status, despite the promises and 
alleged readiness of the relevant authorities, has not as yet 
been defined in the Constitution. In addition to the existing 
discrimination regarding the use of their mother tongue, 
employment, education, and information, this behaviour by the 
Macedonian authorities makes Serbs feel like second rate 
citizens," the statement says. 
  The Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs expects the 
Macedonian side to take all necessary measures so that there 
should be no recurrence of such incidents. The ministry expects 
the Macedonian side to start resolving the issue of the 
constitutional status of the Serbian people living in Macedonia 
in the near future, in accordance with highest CSCE and UN 
standards.

  [Text] Belgrade, 21 January (TANJUG) -- After talks with 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic today, Zoran Djindjic, the 
main candidate of the Democratic Party (DS) and the president of 
the DS executive board, said that they had talked about a 
government of national unity. After nearly an hour of talks 
with the Serbian president, Djindjic said that no party could at 
this moment take the responsibility for forming the government, 
and particularly not, as he stressed, the party that had so far 
formed all Serbian governments. He said that they did not 
discuss the post of the prime minister, but added that it had 
been stressed during the talks that he had to be "a man of 
consensus." 
  The DS believes that the new government's program has to be 
different from all those we have had so far, Djindjic said. 
According to him, the Serbian president said that the future 
government's composition will not be determined by party 
allegiance. 
  Commenting on his impressions of the talks with the Serbian 
president, Djindjic emphasized that the government would be some 
kind of a government of national unity, which should have an 
all-party support and a nonpartisan program. 
  The DS stance is that the president of the new Serbian 
National Assembly should be an opposition deputy, and we hope 
that this will be the case, Djindjic said. He added that the 
president of Serbia "has a somewhat different opinion." 
According to Djindjic, the Serbian president said that the 
Socialist Party of Serbia, as the strongest party, had the right 
to the post of the president of the Serbian Assembly, while the 
opposition parties could have the posts of deputy presidents. 
The DS insists that "the parties [as received] have 
indisputable control of the finance, media, and internal 
affairs," Djindjic said. 
  "If we are not in the position to control for 24 hours a day 
the banks, state media, and the police, and in particular the 
struggle against crime, there is no point in talking about a new 
government and a new coalition," Djindjic stressed. Djindjic 
believes that the new government will not be formed in the next 
two weeks. 
  After Djindjic, Vuk Draskovic went in for talks with 
President Milosevic. Before that, he briefly said to reporters: 
"I have come to meet him and to talk."

  [Text] Belgrade, 21 Jan (TANJUG) -- Vuk Draskovic, the 
leading candidate of Depos [Democratic Movement of Serbia], 
leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement [SPO], declared this 
afternoon that he had told Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic 
that an opposition deputy should be appointed president of the 
Serbian National Assembly. After a two-hour meeting with the 
Serbian president, Draskovic told reporters that a stable 
government can arise from the present parliament -- where 
political forces are equally balanced -- only if the post of 
assembly president goes to an opposition deputy. 
  He recalled that Depos holds the largest number of seats 
among the opposition parties. The SPO leader said he is 
convinced that the Socialist Party of Serbia "will not give up 
the position of republican assembly speaker." He added that he 
agreed with the Serbian president that there can be no ruling 
party and opposition in the struggle against hunger, poverty, 
the sanctions, and the war. 
  We should coordinate political strategy on these issues, 
which are common objectives, stressed the SPO leader. Draskovic 
said that he reached agreement in principle with the Serbian 
president that a spirit of tolerance should prevail in the new 
republican assembly where, he said, facts should be at 
loggerheads, not people and parties. 
  The SPO leader underlined that he cannot say he is a greater 
optimist after the meeting with President Milosevic, but that he 
is not a greater pessimist either. He said that he never 
shouted "Saddam, Saddam" [the slogan of the 8 March 1991 
antigovernment demonstrations in Belgrade when protesters 
shouted "Slobo-Saddam"], and that his criticism is not aimed at 
the person, but at the politician's behavior and actions. He 
said he is satisfied with the talks with Milosevic, that the 
meeting was frank and dynamic, and he described the president of 
Serbia, whom he met for the first time, as a congenial and witty 
man.

  [Text] Belgrade, 21 Jan (TANJUG) -- Andras Agoston, leader 
of the Democratic Community of Vojvodina Hungarians [DZVM], said 
after today's meeting with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic 
that he supports the idea of setting up a government of national 
unity. After the 20-minute meeting with the Serbian president, 
Agoston said he would be "pleased if someone from the oppostion 
became president of the Serbian Assembly." The DZVM cannot be 
the weight to "tip the scales," Agoston said, repeating his 
party's earler stand. "Given our demands for a three-degree 
autonomy [local, cultural, and personal autonomy], even the 
opposition is, to us, like a ruling party," stressed Agoston. 
None of the opposition parties support our idea of a 
three-degree autonomy."

  [Text] Belgrade, 21 Jan (TANJUG) -- Tomislav Nikolic, 
deputy chairman of the Serbian Radical Party [SRS], announced 
today that he refused to attend a meeting with Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic. A statement dispatched to TANJUG says that 
along with some other leaders of the opposition, Nikolic was 
invited to meet the president of the republic today, and that 
the meeting was scheduled to take place at 1600. "I refused to 
go to his office because I have nothing to discuss with Slobodan 
Milosevic as long as state television imposes a blockade on the 
SRS," the statement by the SRS deputy chairman says.

<F P=106> [Interviews with Zoran Djindjic, president of the Democratic </F>
Party, Vuk Draskovic, leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement, 
Andras Agoston, leader of the Democratic Community of Vojvodina 
Hungarians, and Milomir Minic, secretary general of the 
Socialist Party of Serbia, by unidentified correspondent 
following talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in 
Belgrade on 21 Jan -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Djindjic] The president expressed a will to see 
the future government consist of people regardless of their 
party affiliations, a government of national unity, a government 
that will get the support of all the parties, a government whose 
program will be supraparty and directed at solving economic and 
social problems and restoring order to those services that are 
indispensable to the citizens' lives. 
  [Correspondent] Did he perhaps discuss the prime minister? 
  [Djindjic] No, no. It was quite clearly stated during the 
conversation that the prime minister must be someone who can be 
a man of consensus. 
  [Correspondent] On the basis of this conversation, do you 
expect that the assembly will be stabler than the former one? 
  [Djinjdic] I believe that this idea of a government of 
national unity can have a very calming effect on all party 
conflicts, and on the balance of power generally. This is -- so 
to speak -- a strong point around which the parties can now 
gather, and every one of them can say what they are ready to 
invest into this, and what they expect in return. This is a 
very good start, and I believe that this can calm the situation 
both in the parliament and on our political scene. Therefore, 
this conclusion and the expressed desire to assemble all those 
who can contribute to the situation in one government in any 
case promise a stabler and calmer parliament and calmer work in 
this parliament, which will be dedicated to solving concrete 
existential issues rather than interparty conflicts. 
  [Correspondent] In any event, are you optimistic? 
  [Djindjic] Yes, in any event. 
  [Draskovic] When it comes to fighting poverty, winning the 
battle against hunger and crime, lifting the sanctions, ending 
the war, and achieving economic recovery and progress, there can 
be no opposition and government. These must be the shared aims 
of everyone. These shared aims call for a political strategy 
that will be in accordance with all this. 
  [Correspondent] Do you expect the new parliament to be 
stabler than the former one and will produce a stabler 
government? 
  [Draskovic] Such a parliament could give us a stabler 
government only if the post of assembly chairman were given to 
the opposition, and of course, the Democratic Movement of Serbia 
[Depos] is the strongest political group in the opposition. 
This would constitute a complete recognition of the electoral 
result. We have reached an agreement in principle, and I do not 
see that we could have disagreed in principle, that the 
parliament should be permeated by a spirit of tolerance, that 
facts are what is to be disputed, that facts should clash rather 
than people, that parties and party vanities should clash, party 
positions on the list, but only facts [sentence as heard]. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Draskovic, since this is your first 
meeting with Mr. Milosevic, and since you have said certain 
rather uncomfortable things about him as a person, how do you 
personally see this meeting? 
  [Draskovic] I have never said anything about him as a 
person. 
  [Correspondent] Saddam, Saddam. 
  [Draskovic] That was [pauses], let me just see [pauses], I 
would like someone to come up with a single piece of evidence 
that I have ever said Saddam, Saddam, or anything similar. It 
was others who said this, students, young people, citizens, not 
me. However, when it comes to criticizing President Milosevic, 
he heads a state, our fate frequently depends on his actions, 
and whoever holds a public post must also be exposed to the risk 
of being criticized. The president is a charming man, with a 
sense of humor, but okay, that has nothing to do with the 
political side, but since you insist on the atmosphere of the 
talks, I believe that the atmosphere was mutually open, trusting. 
  [Agoston] We also agreed that -- even though this is the 
first time I have ever heard of this idea -- the idea of 
electing a government of national unity was a good idea, a 
government comprised of experts from various parties. I believe 
that it is important that precisely at this point, in these 
times, such unity is achieved, which will make it possible for 
all of us to transcend this difficult situation. 
  [Correspondent] Could you define more clearly your position 
-- that is, the party's position in relation to the ruling party 
and the opposition? 
  [Agoston] Well, I think that this relation -- for us at 
least -- has always been clear. We believe that, considering 
our demands, the opposition is also an opposition for us. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minic, since President Slobodan 
Milosevic has lately been increasingly insisting on a government 
of national unity, how does the Socialist Party [of Serbia], as 
the strongest party and the one with the greatest number of 
deputies in the parliament, see this? 
  [Minic] After both the first and second multiparty 
elections, and today, President Milosevic quite openly and 
clearly insisted on the unification of political forces in 
Serbia, as has been defined, he favors a government of national 
unity. [sentence as heard] We believe that, after the third 
multi-party elections in Serbia, conditions have been met for 
surpassing the first -- so to speak -- infant diseases of 
parliamentary life in the republic and that we should strive to 
conduct such a political struggle that will unify the forces in 
Serbia. As far as the forming of new republican governments is 
concerned, the president always felt that -- at the time of the 
former elections, too -- we should be open to accepting people 
into the government on the basis that they are competent people 
who are successfully dealing with problems in these times, so 
that we see this government of national unity as completely open 
to the most competent and expert people who will assemble in 
such a government, so that we can solve social, economic, and 
political problems which we face. 
  We believe that after these elections, conditions have been 
met for furthering parliamentary life in the republic, for 
having a parliament where parties will compete in trying to find 
those legal solutions which will be best suited to solving the 
economic and social interests of our people, as we have said, 
for Serbia. [sentence as heard] Therefore, we consider 
political life to be a way for parties to clash over such 
projects. [sentence as heard] There will be a competition 
between projects in the parliament, arguments will clash, and 
they will be taken into consideration, rather than who is saying 
what and what they are striving for. [sentence as heard] 
Therefore, we believe that the parliament will have its 
function. 
  [Correspondent] Are the Socialists ready to be without a 
prime minister? 
  [Minic] We believe that the paramount thing right now is to 
constitute the republican parliament, while [pauses] as the 
strongest party, since we have convincingly won the elections, 
that the president will keep in mind [pauses] to give the 
mandate to someone from the Socialist Party of Serbia, or 
depending on the concept. [sentence as heard] We will see how 
this call for a government of national unity will be reflected 
[in the public], and depending on this concept, after the 
parliament is constituted, we will discuss the government in the 
following days. [sentence as heard]

election of a 15-strong approval committee, on the basis of 
whose report the Serbian Assembly is to approve today the 
mandates of 250 deputies elected on 19 December last year, 
Vojislav Dimitrijevic, chairman of the constitutive session, 
called a break until 1400. At the same time, he called on the 
deputies to submit in writing their reasoned proposals for the 
new speaker of the parliament, who is to be elected today. 
Thirty deputies can propose a candidate for the speaker.

<F P=106> [Report by Zoran Vaskovic from the Serbian Assembly] </F>
  [Text] After a three months break, the deputies have again 
convened in the hall of the Serbian Assembly. This time the 
newly appointed deputies are sitting on the benches. The 
session should start any minute. Dr. Vojislav Dimitrijevic, the 
oldest deputy, has still not taken the seat of the chairman. 
Let me remind you that Dr. Dimitrijevic chaired the previous 
assembly last year. He will be assisted in chairing the session 
by the two youngest deputies, Aleksandar Vucic and Milan 
Dragisic. These deputies from the Serbian Radical Party have 
already taken their seats at the chairing table. 
  The first part of the session should be taken up by the 
verification of the deputies' mandates. One of the 250 deputies 
will be elected chairman of the Assembly. The four deputy 
chairmen are also to be elected today. At least 30 deputies are 
needed to put forward a candidate for chairman. We have found 
out unofficially that the Socialist Party of Serbia will put 
forward Dr. Zoran Arandjelovic, the previous chairman, as 
candidate. We have also found out unofficially that the 
Democratic Movement of Serbia [Depos] will put forward as 
candidate for chairman one of the following deputies: Vuk 
Draskovic, Dusan Mihajlovic, Milan Nikovic, or Borivoje Borovic. 
So one of them will be the Depos candidate for chairman of the 
Assembly. The voting will be as the deputies decide, public or 
secret. The candidate who gets the majority vote will be 
elected chairman. 
  When the Assembly is constituted the procedure will commence 
for the formation of the government. The president of Serbia 
will put forward the candidate for the new prime minister. At 
least 126 votes are needed for his election. The deadline for 
the formation of the government has not been given. 
  Esteemed listeners, I am saying all this in the expectation 
that the Serbian Assembly session will begin. It is about to 
start. We will let you know more in our next newscast.

<F P=106> [Report by Milivoje Mihajlovic] </F>
  [Text] The Pristina-based newspaper ZERI writes that they 
have learned from sources close to Ibrahim Rugova that the first 
session of the republic of Kosovo's parliament will be held -- I 
quote -- somewhere in Pristina next week. ZERI also reports 
that the mandates of deputies, elected two years ago in the 
Albanian elections in Kosmet [Kosovo and Metohija], will be 
verified at the session. 
  In a statement for this paper, the Albanian politician Adem 
Demaci commented on this information and said that the Serbs 
have held 12 multiparty elections in the past 12 years [figures 
as received], while the Albanians went to the polls only once. 
Rexhep Qosja, the most influential Albanian intellectual, said 
that if Serbia allowed the session of the republic of Kosovo 
parliament to take place, this would confirm his earlier 
assessment that the organizers of the elections and the Albanian 
parliament were actually Quislings. Let me remind you that the 
first attempt to hold a session of the phantom republic of 
Kosovo's parliament in the Pristina-based Alaudin school 
[medresa Alaudin] was prevented by the police because there was 
a chance of this event provoking a rebellion of the Albanian 
separatists in Kosovo and Metohija.

  [Text] Belgrade, January 21 (TANJUG) -- A certain easing of 
tensions could be expected between the republic of Serb Krajina 
(R.S.K.) and the Republic of Croatia after the signing of the 
statement on normalization of relations between Croatia and the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( F.R.Y.) in Geneva on Wednesday 
[26 January]. 
  "The R.S.K. is ready for dialogue with the Croats on 
restoring the severed flow in the area of infrastructure," said 
R.S.K. foreign minister Slobodan Jarcevic in an interview to the 
Belgrade Daily POLITIKA on Friday. The Serbs proclaimed the 
R.S.K in 1991 in parts of Croatia in which they make up the 
majority population in response to Zagreb's forcible secession 
from the former Yugoslav Federation and attempts at reducing the 
status of the Serbs from a constituent people to one of a 
national minority. Croatia, which does not recognize the 
R.S.K., was trying by means of war to establish there its 
authority although the R.S.K was declared a U.N.-protected area 
in the spring of 1992. 
  It was possible, for instance, to solve the question of 
water 
supply for the port city Zadar from the river Zrmanja, on the 
territory of the R.S.K., but the Croatian side should in return 
enable production of electrical power in the Obrovac power 
plant, explained Jarcevic. The R.S.K. authorities in his view, 
understood the problem of the Croats who were trying to restore 
traffic between the south and the north. This will be made 
possible, but in return most likely access to one of the 
Adriatic ports on the Croatian territory would be requested. 
  "The Belgrade-Zagreb highway, the oil pipeline, the 
establishing of telephone links are in similar packages," said 
Jarvcevic. The R.S.K., he added understood the needs of the 
Croats, but at the same time set out that its own interests too 
were not to be overlooked. Jarcevic especially stressed that 
`no negotiations on the R.S.K. territory could be conducted 
apart from legitimate representatives of the R.S.K.' 
  In view of Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic, 
the 
Geneva agreement between the F.R.Y. and Croatia did not 
prejudice the solution for the R.S.K. The Croatian Government 
decided Friday to restore in a few days telephone links with the 
F.R.Y. severed three years ago, it was announced in Zagreb. 
Normalization of telephone communication was possible within a 
period of two-three days, POLITIKA has learned at the Yugoslav 
postal services. The paper said linking of the electrical power 
lines between the F.R.Y. and Croatia could also be expected. 
These were severed in September 1991.

  [Text] Mate Granic, the Croatian deputy prime minister and 
foreign minister, said in his letter to UNSC [UN Security 
Council] Chairman Karel Kovanda that the joint declaration, 
signed by Croatia and the FRY in Geneva, was the first step 
forward in the process of the normalization of mutual relations. 
Granic also said that the government of the Republic of Croatia 
was deeply convinced that both sides will from now on act 
strictly in accordance with the provisions laid down by the 
Helsinki Final Document of 1975, and especially in line with the 
principle whereby international borders cannot and must not be 
changed by force. Granic stressed that the joint declaration 
was on no account directed against the third side [Muslims] and 
that it should ensure a modus vivendi for Croatian territories 
under UN protection, in keeping with the European Union plan and 
UNSC Resolution 871.

  [Text] [Announcer] Dr. Mate Granic, the deputy prime 
minister and foreign minister, and Dr. Zarko Domljan, the deputy 
chairman of the [Croatian] Assembly, have left for Strasbourg, 
where they are to have talks with Council of Europe officials. 
Before he left, Minister Granic held a brief news conference, 
that was also attended by our reporter Branko [word indistinct]. 
  Setting out the aim of his visit to Strasbourg, Dr. Mate 
Granic said: 
  [Granic] "Croatia has special guest status in the Council of 
Europe, while at this moment the process of it becoming a full 
member has been frozen. The basic aims of my stay in Strasbourg 
will be to explain Croatian positions in the talks in Geneva, 
especially the joint declaration between the Republic of Croatia 
and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and the talks with the 
Bosnian Muslim side, and there will also be a discussion of all 
open questions during a meeting with the most senior officials 
in the Council of Europe. A news conference will also be 
organized." 
  [Announcer] After he was asked to do so by journalist, 
Minister Granic also set out the standpoints and plans of the 
Republic of Croatia regarding the Partnership for Peace [PFP] 
initiative. 
  [Granic] "Croatia welcomes this initiative. President 
Tudjman, even during the peace talks in Bonn welcomed the NATO 
decisions, and also welcomed the initiative during his talks 
with Mrs. Madeleine Albright. Our ambassador in the Council of 
Europe did the same during a meeting of CSCE senior officials. 
Croatia will carefully study all the documents and in a very 
short time send its offer to NATO. It should be stressed that 
Croatia is conscious of specific realities -- namely that 25 
percent of our territory is under UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] supervision. At the same time, Croatia will do 
everything to develop and strengthen democratic institutions, 
especially the Croatian Army, which has no roots in the Warsaw 
Treaty [Organization], but developed out of a defensive war the 
system of which has the same basis as in all democratic 
countries of Europe; it makes use of all the best expert and 
scientific knowledge and also democratic (?rules). We will very 
rapidly get in touch with the North Atlantic Alliance and after 
this we will send it our offer. This will be Croatia's offer to 
the PFP initiative." 
  [Announcer] On his return from Strasbourg on Tuesday [25 
January] Dr. Mate Granic will be present at talks in Ljubljana 
between the Croatian and Slovenian prime ministers. Asked what 
he expects from this meeting, Dr. Granic said: 
  [Granic] "I believe that over these last 10 days or so an 
important step has been taken in the preparation of this 
meeting. I will be joined by Croatian Prime Minister Nikica 
Valentic because this will be a meeting between prime ministers 
and foreign ministers, and I think that an important step will 
be taken to resolve our problems, and of course prepare for the 
signing of very important agreements. We believe that all the 
conditions exist for an agreement to be reached on all economic 
questions -- the questions of Krsko [nuclear plant] and 
Ljubljanska Banka [Ljubljana Bank] and also agreements on 
property and legal issues, as well as an economic agreement and 
numerous other important agreements." 
  [Announcer] According to Minister Granic there will also be 
talks on the Bay of Piran, the question of borders, highways, 
and other questions important to Croatia and Slovenia.

<F P=106> [Report by Miladin Manojlovic from Beli Manastir] </F>
  [Excerpts] As of 1300, 40 percent of the voters in 
Slavonija, Baranja, and Western Srem had visited the polling 
stations, which can be considered a good response considering 
the poor weather conditions in this area. 
  In the Beli Manastir electoral unit, as of 1300, 
approximately 40 percent of the voters have turned out. This 
percentage had already been achieved in Vukovar at 1200. The 
response will definitely be even greater since the sun is 
melting the ice and snow on the paths. The low temperatures and 
ice have forced many people to wait until this afternoon to 
vote. However, some just could not be dissuaded by the bad 
weather to fulfill their civic right and vote for one of the two 
presidential candidates in the republic of Serbian Krajina. 
[passage omitted] 
  The polling stations will remain open until 1900. The first 
unofficial results as to who has won the second round of 
elections, Milan Babic or Milan Martic, will be announced 
tomorrow evening after 1900. Vukovar has forwarded us the data 
for some other localities in the republic of Serbian Krajina. 
In Vojnic, 17 percent voted by noon; Vrgin Most 35 percent; 
Drnis 20 percent; Okucani 32 percent, Pakrac 50 percent; and 
Petrinja 30 percent.

  [Text] Zagreb Archbishop Franjo Kuharic has criticized 
Croatian President Tudjman's policy. The cardinal clearly 
rejected the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina. If a change of 
Bosnia's borders by force were permitted, the borders of Croatia 
and other countries would no longer be inviolable either. The 
church is calling for a peace that does justice to all 
nationalities, explained the cardinal, who sharply condemned 
anti-Semitic media reports in Croatia only a few days ago.

<F P=106> [HINA report: "A 15-Percent Drop in Exports"] </F>
  [Text] Zagreb -- Croatian trade with other countries 
amounted to somewhat more than $8.57 billion last year, which is 
5.4 percent less than in 1992. This was published by the State 
Statistics Institute. Croatian exports amounted to $3.9 
billion, 15.1 percent less than in 1992. At the same time, 
imports increased 4.6 percent as compared to 1992 and reached 
$4.6 billion. 
  As far as the product structure is concerned, the export of 
consumer goods increased 3.6 percent to $1.57 billion. The 
import of the same products to Croatia amounted to $1.16 
billion, 2.9 percent more than in 1992. The export of 
production materials dropped in 1993 by 17.3 percent ($1.97 
billion), and their import by 3.7 percent to $2.74 billion. 
  The most important Croatian trade partners are European 
countries to which products worth $3.6 billion were exported. 
This is 14.9 percent less than in 1992. European countries 
exported to Croatia products worth approximately $4 billion, 
which is 3.9 percent more than in 1992. Exports to the European 
Union in 1993 exceeded those of 1992 by 6.2 percent and amounted 
to somewhat more than $2 billion, whereas during the same time, 
the European Union exported to Croatia goods worth $2.25 
billion, an increase of 20.9 percent as compared to 1992. 
  The most significant among Croatian trade partners are 
Germany, Italy, and Slovenia. Exports to Germany amounted to 
$895 million, which is an increase of 15.8 percent compared to 
1992, whereas Croatian imports from Germany amounted to $990 
million, which is 29.1 percent more than the year before. 
Exports to Italy dropped by 8.8 percent to $828 million. Trade 
with Slovenia decreased, but the exports equaled the imports. 
During 1993, exports to Slovenia dropped by 35.4 percent to 
$711 million, whereas imports from Slovenia dropped during the 
same time by 18.5 percent to $712 million.

<F P=106> [Article by Fran Visnar: "Topaz Among the Serb Howitzers"] </F>
  [Text] What Croatia will do in 1994 is the most frequent 
question that not only the rebel Serbs, but also the military 
analysts in Belgrade ask themselves. Apart from studying the 
power and the intentions of the Croatian Army, they are also 
considering the total Serb potential in case another great 
Serb-Croat war breaks out. 
  Bearing in mind the lessons of the fighting in Slovenia, 
Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina, the strategists of the regular 
Serbian army believe that, at the very beginning of serious 
conflicts with the Croats, as strong forces as possible should 
be be deployed at the crucial point on the battlefield. To 
achieve that, it is necessary to choose the appropriate 
operational direction and avoid the unpleasant experiences of 
Vukovar. The present Serbian commanders (all of whom got a good 
taste of gunpowder during 1991 and 1992) are simply obsessed 
with the importance of selecting the best strategy. They are 
considering all the advantages and disadvantages of simple and a 
complex strategies in relation to Croatia and its defense. They 
will consider the strategy that would, in a given situation, 
enable bringing more of their own forces than enemy troops to be 
best. At any point, the battle is not won by troops noted down 
on lists or scattered, but those that had been collected 
earlier, trained well, equipped excellently, and prepared to go 
into action at the crucial point on the battlefield immediately. 
<H5>  Where Will the Serbs Strike? </H5>
  It has still not been decided in Belgrade where they should 
strike first to "cut the entrails of Croatia." In any case, if 
Serbia starts an open war again (which will be the case if the 
"Krajinas" are endangered), it will not be able to do anything 
without the coordinated support of the army of the Bosnian Serbs 
and joint plans. There is another thing to be clarified. 
Whatever our opinion of the Serbs may be, it has to be admitted 
that they have what military theory defines as stamina, 
elasticity, and the will to survive regardless of the 
conditions, the rationality and justifiability of their 
political opinions, the balance of power, and external 
pressures. The Croat side must, by no means, put all its hopes 
on the economic exhaustion of Serbia and its monetary breakdown. 
North Vietnam also went bankrupt in the Vietnam war, and in the 
late Sixties, instead of the completely devalued local currency, 
the dong, a pack of cigarettes became the unofficial means of 
payment (the clever or lucky Vietnamese who possessed a carton 
of Marlboros were considered rich). In spite of everything, 
Hanoi fought against the Americans for 15 years, with the income 
per capita being $100, and the Vietnamese constantly sending 
weapons and experts to their ideological supporters in South 
Vietnam. 
  Belgrade still does not deprive its cousins in the rebel 
areas of Croatia of heavy weapons, military equipment, and the 
means of transporting troops. On the contrary, while the people 
in Belgrade are fighting and stepping over one another for a 
loaf of bread, and waiting in lines for hours to receive a free 
Christmas cookie, the Serb military industry works at full 
capacity. This time we will present, in detail, three new 
systems that are already being delivered to the "Krajinas" and 
Ratko Mladic's [commander of the armed forces of the republic of 
Srpska] units assigned to intervene as soon as the new round of 
war starts in Croatia and around it. 
  Having fought against the Croats, the Serbs have learned 
that 
they have to remove the losses from the frontlines and deliver 
new stocks fast. This is why they have not sent the remaining 
T-55 tanks to the breaker's yards: 390 of those veterans, made 
in the Sixties, are undergoing many changes and improvements to 
increase their power, armored protection, and mobility. The 
same steering system that the modern M-84 contains has been 
installed in the changed Serbian tank T-55. Its power has been 
increased by installing two launching rails (on the turret) for 
armor-piercing Maljutka guided missiles. The French first 
implemented this idea three decades ago (on small tanks AMX-13); 
the Serbs have now applied it to their still most-numerous basic 
combat tank. The Maljutkas are guided to the target (armored 
vehicles and fortified facilities at a distance between 500 and 
3,000 meters), from the guiding control panel situated in the 
tank itself. The pitch of the missile is regulated by the 
mechanism for elevating the gun barrel, and the operator guides 
the missile by watching through the existing tank telescope 
sight, the magnification factor of which is increased with 
additional optics. With the two missiles that are on the 
launchers all the time, there are also four more Maljutkas 
within the tank turret. 
<H5>  The Systematic Arming of the "Krajina" </H5>
  With further modifications, the Serbs improved the 
characteristics of the artillery ammunition for the T-55, and, 
by installing thermal insulation cover on the outer surface of 
the barrel of the 100-mm caliber gun, the traces appearing as a 
result of uneven cooling are reduced by 80 percent. This has 
increased the precision of the gun itself. The 12.7-mm caliber 
DSKM [expansion unknown] heavy machine gun was retained on the 
turret, as well as the matching 7.62-mm caliber PKT [expansion 
unknown] machine gun. The Serb engineers have also installed the 
anti-cumulative screens, protecting the sides of the tank, below 
the supports for cases and reservoirs, the critical junction of 
the armored panels of the tank floor and the sides, and the 
surface at the level of the junction of the tank turret and the 
armored body. 
  The Serbs want to secure the survival of this veteran 
primarily on the Croatian battlefields. On the front of the 
turret they installed 12 smoke launchers that can fire smoke 
canisters distances greater than 100 meters (the equipment is 
identical to that used on the M-84 tank). Apart from creating a 
smokescreen, the launching barrels for firing smoke canisters 
increase the anti-cumulative protection of the turret (on 
hitting these barrels, enemy missiles are activated too early, 
and their total effect is decreased). 
  Since most of the improved T-55's will be sent to Baranja 
and 
east Slavonia to reinforce the existing armored units, they have 
also installed an entrenching plow (on the lower front glacis 
plate). Entrenching takes 15 to 20 minutes (depending on the 
type and category of soil). The plow switches from use to the 
mobile position and vice versa in 2 to 3 minutes. This 
improvement makes the T-55 independent in creating shelter, and 
the additional armored panel on the plow increases the armored 
protection of the tank front. 
  For close anti-armor fighting, the Serbs have developed a 
new 
light rocket launcher (they call it a "tank destroyer") that 
introduces a new quality in the offensive and defensive 
activities of their infantry. It is a simple 120-mm caliber 
weapon (the M91 rocket launcher is more powerful than the Zolja 
and Osa) whose main purpose is to break active and reactive tank 
shields. It is most effective at 400 to 500 meters distance, 
with a precision that provides for a deviation of 20 centimeters 
from the target. The system is weatherproof (within a 
temperature range from -30 to +50 degrees Centigrade); sand, 
dust, rain, snow, and ice will not harm it. The minimum 
distance using the launcher is 25 meters. The rocket will not 
fail at angles of incidence greater than 20 degrees; the fuse is 
of a quality providing reliable efficiency at all projected 
distances. The launcher is disposable, and a telescope or 
passive night sight can be installed on it. This is the variant 
sent to the Bosnian Serbs and the rebel Serb areas in Croatia, 
while the laser target markers will only be fitted to launchers 
on the ground of mother Serbian (for fear of their being 
captured). From this light, serially produced system, the Serbs 
are developing a similar type of rocket launcher for multiple 
use. 
  What everyone is looking forward to in the "Krajinas" is a 
new 100-m caliber M-91 Topaz anti-tank gun (the Serbs call it a 
gem among guns). Its main purpose is anti-armored fighting at 
distances between 2,000 and 3,000 meters. The Serbs designed 
and started the serial production of this piece, which has a low 
firing height, with the internal ballistic design of the Russian 
T-12 anti-tank gun (which is also of 100-mm caliber). The 
differences in relation to the T-12 is the following: Topaz 
uses the elements of the three-legged gun carriage of the Serb 
122-mm D30-J howitzer, which provides a 360-degree field of 
fire. Above its barrel Topaz has an installed anti-recoil 
device, which the 122-mm D30-J howitzer also contains, 
increasing stability during firing. Moreover, Topaz is 2 meters 
shorter in transport than the T-12 gun (the piece is connected 
to the vehicle through the Topaz gas break). 
  A day-and-night fire-control system [SUV -- fire-control 
system] has been developed for the Topaz. The system can be 
used on the Russian 100-mm T-12 and MT-12 caliber anti-tank guns 
(they are still part of the Serb armament; Croatia also has 
them), and they are ballistically fully compatible with Topaz. 
The fire- control system determines and visualizes all the 
necessary elements of indirect and direct fire at immobile and 
mobile targets. The probability of hitting a mobile target (at 
the distances of efficient destruction range) with the first 
bullet is greater than 70 percent, and the system reaction time 
at battery level is less than 15 seconds. 
<H5>  Let Us Not Fool Ourselves, They Are Not Finished! </H5>
  Let us summarize: The claim one can often hear around here 
is: "The Serbs are finished." However, this is contrary to the 
undoubted Serb vitality in continuing to add links to its chain 
of technical and technological equipment despite the embargo and 
the losses they have suffered. This is why, instead of 
short-term propaganda, it is more important for our state to cut 
off the logistic tail of the Serbian rebellion that wishes to 
hold out with new weapons, in which the messages of fighting in 
these areas over the past three years are inbuilt. For Croatia 
it is a matter of long-term survival. For the Serbs it is a 
misfortune that is only waiting to happen.
