<F P=106> [Report by Nadja Pengov and Suzana Kos on news conference by </F>
Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek in Ljubljana on 19 January -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] Regarding the different public assessments on what 
Partnership for Peace means for Slovenia, Prime Minister Dr. 
Janez Drnovsek has presented his view. According to him, the 
offer for Slovenia to actively participate in the NATO security 
concept is very advantageous and at the moment, the optimum 
opportunity. Partnership for Peace provides Slovenia with the 
equal initial conditions that other European countries have. 
However, it is up to Slovenia to decide how it will join the 
partnership. According to the prime minister, what is important 
for us is to cooperate on drafting defense concepts. We also 
have the opportunity to hold consultations if our security is 
endangered. It is also important that the document has 
particularly presented the concept of the so-called clear 
defense -- in fact, defense that is under the complete control 
of civilian politics. 
  Regarding relations with Croatia, our government does not 
want to bring the events connected with Croatia's debts to the 
Krsko nuclear power plant to the state level. The government is 
convinced that Croatia has to settle its liabilities for the 
electricity that belongs to it and that this is a matter of 
usual business relations. The prime minister expects that this, 
as well as other open questions between the two states, will be 
solved soon at the meeting with Croatian Prime Minister Nikica 
Valentic, which is to be held in Ljubljana next Tuesday, 25 
January. The meeting should be a new stage in our relations. 
However, we cannot guarantee that, he said, even though 
Slovenia is interested in solving all disputed questions and in 
not having mutual relations become aggravated. 
  The Piran Bay border will be, according to Dr. Drnovsek, one 
of the most difficult problems in the negotiations. 
  [Drnovsek] The Slovene stands in this respect are clear and 
proceed from our sovereignty. The Croatian views, however, 
about the Piran Bay have so far been somewhat different. 
  The way in which this issue will be solved depends on how 
all 
the other problems are solved. Regarding the nuclear power 
plant's debts, the government expects the Croatian side to begin 
settling the debts. In case this does not happen, some 
technical measures are already being prepared in the nuclear 
power plant, but this may not be necessary. Slovenia will also 
guarantee the rights that ensue from the Croatian share in the 
nuclear power plant. 
  Dr. Drnovsek also touched upon the decision that Slovenia 
will no longer directly pay part of the debts of the former 
Yugoslavia to the group of commercial banks until an agreement 
is reached on the division of these liabilities. There is still 
no reaction on the part of the creditors to the Slovene 
decision. Our side expects this decision to speed up 
negotiations and that the (?solidarity) clause and the freezing 
of assets of the receiver of the loans will not be implemented. 
According to Dr. Drnovsek, the decision will not affect the 
promised loans that Slovenia, among others, should receive from 
the World Bank. 
  Regarding this year's budget, the prime minister said that 
the government will submit the document to the parliamentary 
procedure within the next 10 days. The deputies should adopt it 
at a session in March. The government will continue the present 
orientations concerning the volume of the budget, which should 
not exceed 402 billion [currency not specified], Prime Minister 
Drnovsek said. The coalition partners should coordinate all key 
questions before the parliamentary debate. For example, the 
coalition will try to agree, among other things, on the fact 
that all [word indistinct] funds will come within the framework 
of the budget. 
  [Drnovsek] Concerning money for gasoline, the Army, and 
education, it is important that solutions be coordinated within 
that joint framework of 402 billion. It is in this direction 
that we seek coordination, which means that funds earmarked for 
defense, for example, should not exceed the funds for education 
and that the education funds should not, conditionally speaking, 
exceed the Army funds. These are two spheres, and there are 
also other ones, but there should be a rational solution 
available that is reasonable and which can be argued for and put 
into the framework of these 402 billion. 
  Regarding the social agreement on the basis of which all 
partners, including the trade unions, will accept their share of 
responsibility for Slovenia's future, the prime minister said 
that in case the social agreement is not adopted, the government 
will adopt the appropriate measures -- above all, on the 
regulation of wages. According to him, administrative measures 
will not be involved, but the paying of wages will be regulated 
by law as it is regulated by the current collective agreement. 
[Word indistinct] of the mentioned wages is fatal for the 
Slovene economy and could lead to its bankruptcy, said the prime 
minister. The government will wait for the decision by the 
coalition partners for approximately two more weeks. Let us 
also mention that the Association of the Free Trade Unions 
yesterday rejected the draft social agreement. Dr. Drnovsek 
comments on that decision: 
  [Drnovsek] If it is true that this is their response, then 
what I just said also holds. The real assessment is that a 
social agreement is not possible at this time, that obviously 
not all partners are ready, that some of the partners are not 
ready to accept responsibility or cannot accept the 
responsibility ensuing from such an agreement. In that case, 
all this responsibility would have to be taken over by the 
government, along with all the difficulties that would ensue 
from that.

  [Text] Zoran Thaler, president of the parliamentary 
Foreign Affairs Commission, at a news conference today outlined 
in more detail the results of a recent visit to Bonn. He 
emphasized that the visit was part of Slovenia's efforts to sign 
the associate membership agreement with the European Union as 
soon as possible and pointed out that as of June, Germany will 
assume the presidency of the European Twelve for six months. 
According to Thaler, the host supports Slovenia's efforts. 
During the visit, the delegation expressed support for German 
efforts to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council. 
The delegation also reminded its host of the unresolved issue of 
war reparations for the Slovene parties wronged in World War II. 
  Thaler also brought up some topical foreign affairs issues. 
He emphasized that the commission will insist on acceptance of 
the cooperation between Slovenia and NATO offered within the 
Partnership for Peace plan. He also expressed surprise over the 
foreign minister's support of the Croatian-Serbian agreement on 
the normalization of relations between Belgrade and Zagreb.

<F P=106> [Interview with Slovene Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle by </F>
Djurdjica Klancir in Ljubljana; date not given: "I Am Not For 
Slovenia's Implementing the Hammer Policy Against Croatia"] 
  [Text] In the last several months, Slovene Foreign 
Minister Lojze Peterle has been putting up with severe criticism 
in the Slovene Parliament: He is being reproached for being too 
soft, too naive in negotiations with Croatia. His political 
opponent, Dimitrij Rupel, is particularly vociferous. "No, I do 
not want to polemicize with him. When he was a minister he did 
not know how to protect the Slovene fishermen, whereas now, for 
every single problem he has the best and the only possible 
solution...," Peterle ironically comments on the diplomatic 
achievements of his predecessor in the informal part of the 
interview. 
  In this moment, Croato-Slovene relations are really in a 
crisis. Only a day after our conversation with Minister Peterle, 
one of the most critical problems between two states -- the 
Krsko nuclear power plant -- reached a climax again: Croatia 
was disconnected from the power grid after the station was 
overhauled! Nevertheless, calmly and composedly, Minister 
Peterle claims that the problem, just like all others, can be 
solved in a peaceful and civilized manner, to the satisfaction 
of both sides. 
  [Klancir] Recently you stated to the Viennese KURIER that 
the Slovene-Croatian relations had been broken up completely. 
Which political moves -- on the Slovene or Croatian part -- do 
you think are to blame for such a situation? 
  [Peterle] No, the KURIER journalist did not understand me 
well. The relations between Slovenia and Croatia have never 
been completely broken up at any time. Some contacts always 
exist. The truth is, however, that the relations between the 
two states are not developing as quickly as we would like them 
to. 
  [Klancir] Have the activities of the expert groups been 
interrupted, who are working on the maps regarding some delicate 
issues of territorial demarcation? 
  [Peterle] Those activities have not been completely 
interrupted. It is true that the mixed diplomatic commission is 
not working for the time being, because the Croatian side has 
not yet designated the new chairman, a successor of Mr. Rudolf, 
which prevents the commission to work normally. Right now we, 
the Slovene side, are preparing a response to the Croatian 
attitudes regarding the border in the bay of Piran. As for the 
Ljubljanska Banka and the Krsko nuclear power plant, the 
attitudes are going through the process of harmonization, while 
one can say that the agreements on trade and the cultural 
cooperation are ready to be signed. The agreement on trade [as 
published] is also ready to be signed.... Which is to say, if we 
were to "open" the package of agreements, some of them could 
certainly be signed that very moment. However, all those 
agreements are dealt with as a whole, rather than individually. 
That is, we are working, we are making progress, but not as 
quickly as we would want to. If one insists on assessing 
failures, then it can be said that both sides have failed to 
improve the mutual relations, rather than only one side. 
  [Klancir] In a confidential document of the Slovene Foreign 
Ministry, which was partly brought out by the Slovene REPUBLIKA, 
a more severe Slovene attitude in future negotiations with 
Croatia is announced. What is that more severe attitude 
supposed to be like? 
  [Peterle] Personally, I do not use such words in diplomatic 
endeavors.... No goal is accomplished by severeness. I think 
that a much better term is -- consistency. So, I think that, in 
the relations with Croatia, we have to be consistent. 
Concretely, as far as borders are concerned, we shall continue 
our efforts to reach the agreement on implementing the first, 
general criterion regarding the demarcation. We are still 
proposing that one should start from the criterion of land 
registry districts. However, if both sides agree that such a 
criterion is not applicable, we shall pick a new one, or perhaps 
some additional criteria. We shall be consistent also in our 
insisting on the agreement on borders that was reached after the 
declarations of independency of both states, which is to say, we 
shall demand that the state of affairs as it was on 26 July 1991 
be observed. In that respect one needs no severity -- 
consistency will do, whereas sometimes we cannot be consistent 
without a high tone. 
  [Klancir] How will the Slovene severity reflect itself in 
the case of Krsko? 
  [Peterle] The Slovene attitude should also not be marked by 
severity in that case. That case is above all about a business 
relationship, rather than about politics. If the nuclear power 
plant produces power for both the Slovene and Croatian 
consumers, and the Slovene consumers are paying for it much more 
regularly than the Croatian consumers, the protests on the part 
of Slovenia are quite justifiable. The question is raised: Why 
are we crediting the Croatian consumers? So, the issue is about 
a purely business relationship. Both sides ought to pay their 
bills, and one should not make interstate problems out of 
that.... I personally insist, despite all the criticisms, on 
constructive talks, rather than on the hammer policy. I have 
agreed with [Croatian] Minister Mate Granic that we should be 
creating a constructive atmosphere, without tension, in which we 
shall be able to settle all problems more easily. A different 
issue is the question of a new legal arrangement of relations 
regarding Krsko, where many questions are still open. 
  [Klancir] REPUBLIKA has written that, in the aforementioned 
document, the sincerity of the Croatian side in the negotiations 
is called into question. Why is the Croatian sincerity called 
into question? 
  [Peterle] We do not need REPUBLIKA. Let us put it this way: 
While Mr. Franjo Greguric was prime minister, we signed the 
agreement on economic cooperation with him. However, the 
Croatian Parliament did not ratify that agreement, although 
Greguric's party, that is the Croatian Democratic Community 
[HDZ], has a great majority in the parliament. It was a slap in 
the face for the Slovene side.... 
  We also have a fresher example of Croatian inconsistency in 
the policy on Slovenia. I was personally at the HDZ convention 
this year. In the contacts with many politicians, I got the 
impression that the Croatian side was seriously working on the 
improvement of Croat-Slovene relations. Many nice things were 
said.... However, as soon as I left Zagreb, the problem with 
the accommodation of refugees in Slovene resorts [in Istria] 
broke out, although we agreed quite concretely that we shall 
settle the issue in cooperation and as carefully as possible. 
That problem resounded in the Slovene public very negatively. 
It was all the same to the Slovenes whether the accommodation 
of refugees in the resorts was ordered by the Croatian defense 
minister or somebody else -- they felt that somebody made fools 
out of them (still, the situation is much better now). 
  [Klancir] You have just said that you were at the HDZ 
convention. Rupel assessed your attempts to make progress in 
Slovene-Croatian relations through meetings of the two parties, 
that is your Christian Democrats and the HDZ, as completely 
unsuccessful. 
  [Peterle] Rupel will have to get used to the fact that 
democratic changes in two states bring about such contacts as 
well. That is nothing unusual. In Croatia, the HDZ is the most 
powerful political party, whereas in Slovenia the Christian 
Democrats are the second strongest party. The foreign ministers 
of those countries are members of those two parties, and it is 
logical that they cooperate, and communicate. 
  [Klancir] When the Commission for Interstate Relations in 
the Slovene Parliament proposed, for the first time, as a new 
phase of Slovene-Croatian negotiations, a top-level meeting, 
that is with Milan Kucan and Janez Drnovsek on one side, and 
Franjo Tudjman on the other side, you refused. Why? 
  [Peterle] So long as we have not worked out any concrete 
solutions on the expert level, I think it is senseless to listen 
to the principled assessments and good wishes regarding 
Slovene-Croatian relations. Which is to say, it is the experts 
who should be given priority, and only then a confirmation on 
the highest level. Drnovsek shares that opinion.... Until we 
arrange the balance of the Ljubljanska Banka, until we work out 
a solution for the nuclear power station -- it makes no sense to 
listen to the statements saying that we should by all means get 
down to solving those problems. After all, that has already 
been said before.... 
  [Klancir] In your interview with KURIER, you presented the 
problem of the border in the bay of Piran as a serious matter of 
conflict. Do you think that is the most difficult problem in 
Croat-Slovene relations? Are there any new suggestions for the 
settlement of the problem? 
  [Peterle] I am not sure whether I would place that problem 
on the top of the list of our problems, that is to say, whether 
I would define it as the most difficult. Perhaps.... It is 
certainly difficult -- because the Croatian and the Slovene 
concepts of the solution are quite different. Slovenia rejects 
the model of condominium in the bay. The Slovene attitude is 
clear -- one ought to start from the borders defined by land 
registries. One cannot expect Slovenia to agree to a limitation 
of the rights it had before. Slovenia has the right to free 
access to the sea that it had in former Yugoslavia. 
  [Klancir] How high is the problem of Krsko ranked on the 
list of problems? 
  [Peterle] There are really no reasons for Krsko to be a 
stumbling block in political negotiations. What is necessary is 
to prepare the foundations in the newly-created legal 
circumstances for a new agreement, that is, one ought to settle 
the question of ownership, debts, prices, nuclear waste. Yet, 
there are no reasons for the consumers not to pay for the power 
they are obtaining from Krsko. That is a matter of the business 
relationship. 
  [Klancir] If many agreements are almost ready to be signed 
-- as you yourself say -- why are not they signed then? Where 
are the obstacles to be found? 
  [Peterle] After the Slovene-Croatian meeting in Bizeljsko, 
the work on the expert level did not start developing at the 
expected pace. On the Slovene side the opinion prevails that 
the Croatian side is slowing down the process, that it is not 
responding quickly enough to our proposals. Of course, it is 
possible that the Croatian side will say that the problem lies 
in Slovene slowness. Perhaps the Croatian negotiators have 
counted a much faster Slovene response to the latest Croatian 
idea regarding the settlement of the Piran Bay issue. However, 
we are preparing a very comprehensive respond to the proposal. 
Besides, it is clear that Croatia has some other priorities in 
foreign policy -- for instance, the problems in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina -- so that it cannot engage itself in 
relations with Slovenia as much as we would like it to. 
  [Klancir] So, you have understanding for the fact that 
Croatia is in a state of war.... 
  [Peterle] The opposition reproaches me that I have too much 
understanding for Croatia! 
  [Klancir] In his interview with GLOBUS, Rupel expressed a 
sort of threat. He said: "It is clear that Slovenia might just 
as well inflict a lot of harm to Croatia on the international 
stage." 
  [Peterle] That could perhaps have happened during Rupel's 
mandate, who stated before that he did not want Croatia to be a 
millstone around his neck (excuse me, but Rupel does not 
represent the entire Slovene people). The political relations 
with any neighbor cannot be arranged in that way.... I am 
against any threats or blackmails in Slovene-Croatian relations. 
Croatia will certainly advance in its getting involved in the 
work of various international organizations.... All those 
organizations have certain criteria for the admittance, and if 
Croatia fulfills them -- it will be admitted into those 
organizations. The same applies to admittance to the European 
Council. It is pretentious to claim that the European Council 
will take into consideration whether Slovenia is for or against 
it. 
  [Klancir] How do you comment on the results of a public 
opinion poll that was carried out in Slovenia, showing that 
Slovenes view Croatia as being their greatest enemy, and that 
they are not excluding the possibility of a war? A similar poll 
in Croatia shows that Croats do not hold such a view of Slovenes. 
  [Peterle] I admit, I got seriously worried about the results 
of that public opinion poll. If it is authentic, those are 
quite alarming results. It is difficult to develop the 
relations between two countries if a considerable part of the 
population views the neighboring country as being the greatest 
enemy. If we are trying to find out any rational reasons for 
such a view, perhaps we can find them out in the steps that the 
Croatian Government has made with regard to the Slovene resorts 
in Istria, and even with regard to the Buzet brewery. That has 
caused a considerable revolt among the Slovenes. Many of them 
have vacation houses in Istria, and the fear has been provoked 
that they might be soon taken away from them. 
  [Klancir] What is being concretely undertaken in order to 
improve Croat-Slovene relations? 
  [Peterle] We have to bring the work on the expert level to a 
conclusion. That is to say, we are awaiting the settlement of 
the problem of Ljubljanska Banka. In several days we will hold 
a meeting with the representatives of all sectors whose 
relations with Croatia are problematic. Tomorrow I am having a 
meeting with Zagar, the Croatian ambassador.... Besides, a 
written proposal made by Slovenia regarding the settlement of 
the Piran Bay issue is supposed to be finished soon. The 
experts are still working on it. I hope that the negotiations 
about the nuclear power station of Krsko will also advance; 
State Secretary Sovic has just told me that some new ideas are 
being worked out -- ideas that might bring about a satisfactory 
solution for both sides. Which is to say, we are constantly 
working on it.... The Croatian side will probably designate the 
head of the diplomatic negotiating group. And then, quite 
calmly, we could go for the signing of certain agreements.

  [Text] Ljubljana, January 22 (TANJUG)--The authorities of 
the Former Yugoslav Republic of Slovenia have refused to issue 
entry visas to world renowned Serbian writer Milorad Pavic and 
the well-known academic choir "Branko Krsmanovic" of Belgrade, 
who were to take part in a religious ceremony officiated by the 
local Serbian Orthodox community. The Slovenian Foreign 
Ministry has assessed, in agreement with the Ministry for 
Culture, that the arrival of Pavic and the "Branko Krsmanovic" 
choir in Ljubljana are "not in the interest of the Slovenian 
state," TANJUG learned. The ministry did not specify in what 
way the artists were a threat to the state of Slovenia. 
  Pavic and the "Branko Krsmanovic" choir were to take part in 
an academy marking the day of St. Sava in Ljubljana, which is 
organized by the Serbian Orthodox community. The action by the 
Slovenian authorities has in fact indirectly prevented this 
ceremony from taking place. St. Sava day has been celebrated by 
Serbian Orthodox Christians on January 27 since the early 
thirteenth century when Rastko Nemanjic, a Serbian medieval 
ruler, monk and educator was proclaimed Saint Sava after his 
death. 
  Peran Boskovic, a priest of the Serbian Orthodox Church in 
Ljubljana, recently sent a letter to Slovenian Prime Minister 
Janez Drnovsek, urging him to help enable the holding of 
Orthodox religious ceremonies. There has been no reply yet. 
This indirect assault on religious ceremonies of non-Slovenes 
by the Slovenian authorities, which took place despite promises 
by certain Catholic Church dignitaries that other religions 
would not be discriminated against in Slovenia, might provoke an 
embittered protest by tens of thousands of Serbs who live in 
Slovenia. 
  Slovenia recently twice in two weeks banned entry into 
Slovenia to well-known Serbian pop singer Mocilo Bajagic Bajaga, 
although his concerts in Ljubljana and Maribor had been sold out.

<F P=106> [Interview with Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak by </F>
Stanislaw Cwik and Dariusz Szymczycha; place and date not given: 
"Let Us Not Argue; Let Us Solve Problems"] 
  [Text] [TRYBUNA] You have come back from Prague. We did not 
expect anything momentous from that meeting. The Partnership for 
Peace [PFP] was supposed to be an anteroom to NATO, and it 
remains that way. Your idea of a Partnership for Development was 
received as a novelty. Do you see any obstacles to economic and 
scientific cooperation with Western countries? 
  [Pawlak] Poland's external security consists of a number of 
factors. One of the most important is economic and social 
stability. During the recent rather frequent visits of U.S. and 
EU [European Union] representatives in Poland, we said that, 
although the PFP may lead us toward NATO, it does not guarantee 
that we will join it. In a situation where there are so many 
obstacles to NATO entry, economic efficiency is becoming a major 
guarantee for our future. 
  That is why we are so worried about our unstable economic 
cooperation with the West. Despite guarantees stemming from 
accords and agreements, the West does not always treat us as an 
equal partner. That is the reason behind the Partnership for 
Development idea, especially economic development. This idea was 
proposed during the consultations that preceded the NATO summit. 
It found an echo in President Clinton's remark during the NATO 
summit about the need to open the U.S. and EU markets more 
widely to products from Central Europe. 
  [TRYBUNA] So the Partnership for Development could mean a 
new 
stage in economic development? 
  [Pawlak] Yes. The Uruguay round of talks ended in December. 
It brought new solutions regarding customs tariffs, but it also 
created confusion regarding nontariff issues. In fact, it 
created new restrictions to Polish trade on the U.S. and Western 
markets. How are we to overcome them? By standardizing our 
products and raising their quality. We can also follow the 
West's example and impose equalizing levies on the prices of 
some Polish exports and harsh hygienic requirements regarding 
certain Polish imports. 
  Such a solution may have a bearing on the development of 
Poland and the entire region. 
  [TRYBUNA] But there is nothing momentous about this. It is 
merely imitation. 
  [Pawlak] Yes, but it is imitation of momentous significance. 
No Polish government used such methods before. 
  We want a multifaceted partnership. Therefore we are trying 
to open up economic cooperation in all directions. Our 
businessmen must perform reconnaissance immediately and not 
leave it until our trade partners have failed us. 
  [TRYBUNA] So one can say that this is the beginning of the 
end of the Visegrad Group? 
  [Pawlak] During the prime ministerial talks in Prague, we 
considered a way of expanding the Visegrad formula and 
converting it from a political body into an economic one. 
Perhaps we need a G-4 group, concentrating on creating a free 
trade zone and relaxing trade conditions. During the Prague 
talks, we suggested a practical dimension to Visegrad 
cooperation. 
  [TRYBUNA] Prime Minister, can Poland be a partner in the 
Partnership for Development? Look at the state of Polish 
agriculture. It is not impressive. How do you intend to change 
Polish agriculture and drag it to its feet again? 
  [Pawlak] I do not share your harsh opinion on the subject of 
Polish agriculture. Polish agriculture's capabilities are 
underestimated. 
  If one looks at production organization and technology and 
the variety of goods, one will see that our agriculture could 
play a larger role in the economy that is the case at present. 
It can also make a greater contribution to international trade. 
These reserves have not been used until now because not all of 
the economic mechanisms have been adapted to our agriculture. We 
also discussed this in Prague. 
  Our agricultural production is often cheaper than in 
developed countries so we can enter world markets without 
additional costs--that is, without burdening the budget. An 
increase in agricultural exports is hampered not so much by 
market barriers as by administrative restrictions in the form of 
special fees whose only purpose is to bar our products to 
foreign markets. 
  Another problem of Polish agriculture is how to make use of 
excess produce. We are seeking ways of increasing the production 
of industrial raw materials, which might then be applied to 
other sectors of the economy. 
  [TRYBUNA] But, during the election campaign and even before 
it, the Polish Peasant Party accused the Solidarity governments 
of lacking an agricultural policy. If things were considered bad 
under Solidarity, why should they be considered good today? 
  [Pawlak] It is the possibilities that are good today, not 
the 
actual state of things. Apart from that, we spoke of the absence 
of not only an agricultural policy, but also an industrial and 
social one. 
  The Polish countryside has its specific nature. There are 
people who see only faults in it. But we also see positive 
features. After all, in some developed countries, there is now a 
departure from excessive concentration in urban planning, from 
shutting people up in concrete apartment blocks. The trend is 
now in favor of distributing the population more loosely. Modern 
science permits the location of very modern firms at a 
considerable distance from the capital. 
  So when people complain that the Polish countryside is 
overpopulated, we reply that rural inhabitants are 
self-sufficient and do not burden the budget. Is it not better 
to create employment for them where they live, rather than move 
them to urban areas? Which solution is more profitable and less 
costly in social terms? 
  We should not apply a doctrine that calls for a fixed rural 
population level. We must avail ourselves of any solution that 
opens up prospects. I think that is the way we should view the 
Polish countryside. 
  [TRYBUNA] You already have several months' experience as 
the prime minister of a coalition government. In the beginning, 
you said the government would last four years. Are you still so 
optimistic? 
  [Pawlak] Yes, I think we will survive. 
  [TRYBUNA] We are asking because there are already strikes, 
and there has been an announcement about demonstrations and a 
general strike. 
  [Pawlak] Indeed, we are not in for an easy time. We have 
drafted a budget that is dictated by the reality that we have 
inherited. We have also "ironed out" many matters. But the media 
enjoy concentrating on difficulties, especially on announced 
price hikes, quite forgetting that these difficulties and price 
hikes are the consequences of the activity of previous 
governments and that my government is trying to help those in 
the worst material situation. Generally, we have altered the 
philosophy behind wages policy in the public sector, and we are 
raising minimum pensions and offering incentives in the 
agricultural sector to those who are energetic and produce 
high-quality goods. The media somehow do not want to notice any 
of this. 
  I want to be properly understood. I do not complain if 
people 
indicate dangers, even if they exaggerate. But I would prefer it 
if they suggested solutions and new possibilities. 
  Of course, there may be protests and demonstrations, but we 
no longer have a situation where one single trade union 
determines our future. The population now determines its own 
future in elections. For example, if the present government and 
coalition are incapable of solving basic problems, they will 
lose the next elections. I am counting on an improvement to the 
situation by the time the next elections take place. This is not 
an easy task, but I am counting on a high level of commitment 
not by just state institutions but also by individuals--for 
example, those who lay down fiscal policy. 
  [TRYBUNA] Do you not regret the fact that you did not 
commence your tenure by exposing the state of the Polish economy 
you inherited and drawing up a report? Criticism of the 
government is frequently based on the remarks of Mrs. Suchocka 
and Messrs. Rokita and Syryjczyk. 
  [Pawlak] We did produce a report but only for our own 
internal purposes, and there is no need to reveal all of the 
features of the Polish economy to the public. But we did present 
many of these features when we drew up our budget--I did so in 
my 29 December speech and so did Deputy Prime Minister 
Borowski--but we were more concerned with convincing everyone 
that, despite all of these difficulties, it is possible to halt 
the negative phenomena and move forwards. 
  Perhaps we are not making satisfactory progress in every 
single sphere. There is no doubt that a social debate or 
tripartite pact between the government, employers, and employees 
would help explain the current situation and permit better 
prospects. I fear that the government might not be sufficiently 
energetic in this regard. 
  [TRYBUNA] The government's personnel policy is being 
criticized. What principles of personnel policy do you profess? 
  [Pawlak] I have the dubious honor of being criticized from 
various quarters. Some people criticize me for making any 
personnel changes whatsoever, and others do so because I 
tolerate the presence of officials whose views differ from the 
government's. 
  I think it is important to use the knowledge and experience 
of various people. That often provides good results. The 
important thing is to concentrate on tasks. Poland has lost too 
many people since the war. There are times when it is worth 
viewing personnel matters from a wider angle and not just from a 
political one. 
  As far as the administration is concerned, personnel changes 
there should come as no surprise. It is difficult to expect 
people to be loyal to a government they cannot stand. On the 
other hand, one cannot tolerate a situation where everyone 
pursues his own policy. That is why changes are necessary. 
  [TRYBUNA] How much independence do you have in the making of 
personnel decisions? 
  [Pawlak] This is a coalition government, which means that we 
try to seek a joint solution to issues regarding the functioning 
of the coalition. But certain personnel issues are my sole 
responsibility. That depends on the situation and the case at 
hand. 
  I can say that, despite the variety of situations, 
cooperation between the coalition partners has generally been 
good. Even if there are disputes, they provide conclusions. It 
does not matter if the media try to inflame moods and make it 
look as if there is a coalition crisis. If I were not in the 
government, I would enjoy reading such things myself. But the 
result of the 19 September election was clear inasmuch as it 
showed the coalition partners what the electorate wants. 
Therefore, we should concentrate on solving problems and not 
invent reasons to argue. 
  [TRYBUNA] So the coalition will last four years? 
  [Pawlak] That depends on the relationships between the 
coalition groups and on the situation within each group. I count 
on them to appreciate the opportunity that has arisen in Poland. 
Inside Poland we can decide on most issues to the advantage of 
everyone. Our predecessors tended to forget that the reforms are 
meant to serve the people and not to further the interests of a 
group of visionaries or idealists who want to reform the world 
but have forgotten who they are working for.

<F P=106> [Article by J.B.L. and P.W.R.: "Walesa and Olechowski Are </F>
Surprised"] 
  [Text] President Lech Walesa expressed his "surprise and 
lack of understanding" and the foreign affairs minister his 
"surprise and sorrow"--all this was in official communiques 
issued by their press spokesmen. The reason for these statements 
is the establishment by the Sejm Foreign Affairs Committee of an 
extraordinary subcommittee, whose task is to evaluate the 
condition of the cadres in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MSZ]. 
  The subcommittee was set up through the votes of the 
deputies 
of the governing coalition and the Union of Labor party. 
Deputies of Democratic Union refused to take part in the 
subcommittee's work; the establishment of the subcommittee was 
criticized by the Deputies' Club of the Nonparty Bloc in Support 
of Reforms. 
  According to Olechowski, the decision establishing the 
subcommittee infringes upon the powers of the minister of 
foreign affairs. Also at a meeting with Sejm Speaker Jozef 
Oleksy the minister expressed his sorrow at the fact that it had 
been set up. 
  There were rumors in the Sejm building that the entire 
subcommittee affair might lead to a conflict between the 
coalition and the Belweder. It was speculated that, if the 
coalition had received the post of a deputy minister in the MSZ, 
which it demanded, the subcommittee would probably not have been 
established. Tadeusz Iwinski, deputy of the Democratic Left 
Alliance, denied this information. He believes that the 
committee will help select the right people for the MSZ posts, 
such as the posts of ambassadors. He also said that, in recent 
years, many candidates without the right qualifications have 
been appointed to these posts.

  [Text] Warsaw, 21 Jan--Speaking on Friday at the Sejm, 
Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski stated, among other things, 
that, in the short- and medium-term prospects, there are no 
threats to the territorial integrity of the Polish Republic. No 
country, no significant political power, no noteworthy 
politician has any claims against us. 
  The minister pointed out that treaty obligations on the 
inviolability of borders, the renouncement of claims, and the 
protection of minorities (the exception here is Lithuania, with 
whom we will sign a similar undertaking soon) are linking Poland 
to all of our neighbors. As of February, an agreement on the 
association with the European Union [EU] will come into force. 
Structures of the regional cooperation are developing, albeit 
slowly: the Visegrad Group, the Council of the Baltic States, 
the Central European Initiative [CEI]. The CSCE, where we 
distinguish ourselves with activity, has already borne fruit, 
with a significant collection of pan-European military and 
political obligations. "Poland is not alone; Poland has good 
relations with its neighbors; Poland is not threatened with 
war," Olechowski stated. 
  As far as the threats are concerned, in the minister's view, 
"There can be attempts to exert political and economic pressure, 
to weaken the feeling of security, threats to economic and 
civilization development as well as to the international 
position of Poland. We can find ourselves in the direct 
proximity of a reborn empire, which may make efforts to extend 
its sphere of influence also to Central Europe. The situation on 
the post-Soviet territory can rapidly be destabilized. 
Conditions for the trade exchange and economic cooperation may 
become worse. Nationalities' problems and rivalry may increase 
in this region. Our ecological security may, as a result of the 
course of events, be threatened." 
  While referring to the Brussels summit of NATO states and 
the 
meeting of presidents in Prague, the minister said that, as a 
result of both of these events, "Poland is more secure today 
than it was yesterday." 
  Olechowski underscored that the statement on opening NATO to 
new members from East Europe was the decision to which we 
attached the greatest importance. "This fundamental decision on 
opening the alliance, closed so far to new members, has been 
clearly favorable to Poland. It makes our future membership 
possible and increases the sense of purpose for actions in that 
direction. 
  "However, the decision is imperfect in two aspects: It 
defines neither a date for accepting new members nor the 
criteria they will have to meet; it conditions the acceptance of 
a new member not only to the degree of its readiness to join, 
but also to the assessment of European security as a whole. This 
gives rise to suspicions as to the significance of the possible 
opposition by Russia, although the statements clearly point out 
that `no (third) country is to have a right to veto NATO's 
decisions on the issue.'" 
  According to Olechowski, the Partnership for Peace 
initiative 
has established a new form of cooperation with NATO. It also has 
a "significant political dimension as it is linked to the 
acceptance by participating states of important obligations to 
protect democracy in internal relations and to observe 
international law in external relations. It gives particular 
emphasis to the commitment to restrain from a threat of the use 
of force against territorial integrity and political 
independence of states and to respect existing borders and solve 
disputes by peaceful means. 
  "The states participating in the initiative will also 
confirm 
their commitment to observe CSCE principles and adopt 
obligations concerning disarmament and arms control. 
Furthermore, in the military sphere, the initiative obligates, 
among other things, the clarification of military planning and 
budget and the ensuring of civilian control over the Armed 
Forces. The countries that will not observe the above-mentioned 
principles will be subject to negative reactions by NATO." 
  According to the minister, this important political 
dimension 
of the initiative, for which Polish diplomacy was striving 
vigorously, "will improve the state of security on our 
continent, and, for that reason alone, it is favorable to us. 
However, the main benefits from the Partnership for Peace 
initiative are: First, it will ensure our closer cooperation 
with NATO than to date; second, it will bring us closer to 
membership in this institution (in accordance with the summit 
decisions, active participation in the program will be one of 
the criteria for new members); and third, it will improve the 
level of our security. 
  Referring to other decisions taken at the Brussels summit to 
which we attach significance, the minister said that Poland 
"consistently believes that the U.S. presence in Europe is 
necessary for the security of our continent. We recognize 
statements like `nothing is more important for our (American) 
security than the relations with Europe,' as well as decisions 
to maintain the presence of 100,000 U.S. soldiers as 
unequivocally beneficial for us," he stated. 
  Olechowski pointed out that "Poland is interested in seeing 
the Western European Union [WEU], which is an institution for 
the military cooperation of the members of the EU, becoming more 
significant and effective. Achieving the status of an associated 
member, we have the right to make efforts to obtain the same 
status in all institutions created by the union. Then, with the 
progress of integration with the EU, we will be tightening our 
cooperation with the WEU until our full membership, which is 
linked to NATO membership. The WEU security guarantees are much 
more categorical than the NATO guarantees." 
  Pointing once again to the "clearly positive balance for 
Poland" of decisions made by NATO, the minister recalled that 
the Council of Ministers expressed on the 10th of this month "a 
will and a readiness for active participation in the 
implementation of programs linked to the Partnership for Peace 
scheme and to obligate the ministers of foreign affairs and 
national defense to prepare proposals for appropriate actions, 
including legal acts connected with Polish participation in its 
implementation. These actions should ensure that full advantage 
will be taken from the opportunities created by the scheme (...) 
to tighten the links between Poland and NATO and to increase the 
level of external security of the Polish state." 
  According to Olechowski, the Council of Ministers confirmed 
"that our strategic objective (...) was and has been Polish 
membership in the North Atlantic Alliance." He added that it 
seemed important that the Sejm also expressed a similar view. 
"If today we can say that, albeit to an insufficient degree, 
Poland after all managed to exert influence on the final shape 
of the NATO summit, then it all happened to a large extent 
thanks to the wide political support the president and our 
diplomacy enjoyed in the world. Such a consensus, this 
impressive support, are still needed in the difficult efforts to 
join NATO and the WEU. A lack of consensus makes these efforts 
worthless." 
  In the final part of his speech, the minister said: "An 
active policy of developing friendly relations with all of our 
neighbors, patient and consistent promotion of regional 
cooperation, a policy toward ethnic minorities that is in 
keeping with European standards, active participation in 
European initiatives, and economic initiatives such as the 
partnership for development scheme that was formulated by the 
prime minister are examples of other significant actions. 
Although the world around us is changing and proceeds in an 
unknown direction, and although we have only limited influence 
on the course of events, all of these actions result in the fact 
that we do not have enemies around us."

  [Text] Warsaw, 21 Jan--On 21 January, the Foreign Affairs 
Ministry issued the following statement to the Polish Press 
Agency: 
  "It is with great satisfaction and approval that the Foreign 
Affairs Ministry of the Polish Republic heard of the signing on 
14 January in Moscow of a three-sided agreement by the 
Presidents of the Russian Federation, the United States, and 
Ukraine. 
  President Leonid Kravchuk's decision regarding the 
denuclearization of Ukraine will have a beneficial influence on 
the security and the stability of the region, of Europe, and the 
world, despite the fact that this process is expected to take 
seven years. 
  The signing of the Moscow document opens the way to broader 
possibilities of cooperation between Ukraine and the Western 
world. 
  The Foreign Affairs Ministry of the Polish Republic 
expresses 
the hope that the concluded agreement will be implemented very 
shortly."

<F P=106> [Article by Maja Narbutt from Kaliningrad: "Polish Consulate </F>
Opens in Kaliningrad"] 
  [Text] Yesterday a Polish consulate was officially opened 
in Kaliningrad. It is the first diplomatic post of this rank in 
the Kaliningrad Oblast; a German consulate is supposed to be 
opened there in a few months. 
  On the same day, Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Iwo 
Byczewski and Kaliningrad Oblast Mayor Yuri Matochkin signed a 
document on the establishment of a Polish-Russian Council for 
Cooperation Between Poland's North-Western Voivodships and the 
Kaliningrad Oblast. The council will start work in March. 
  The Kaliningrad Oblast, part of the Russian Federation 
located farthest west and the most militarized area in Europe, 
aspires to become a Russian Hong Kong. New prospects for Western 
investors arose in December of last year, when a decree by 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin exempted their goods from the 
customs duty. The decree also exempted them from paying taxes 
for four years. 
  Polish companies are most numerous as far as foreign capital 
enterprises in the oblast are concerned. However, German 
investors have invested the greatest amount of money there. 
According to Polish entrepreneurs working in Kaliningrad, the 
gap between German and Polish capital is steadily increasing.

  [Text] Aleksander Kwasniewski, leader of the Democratic 
Left Alliance [SLD], said that the coalition will continue its 
efforts to obtain deputy minister posts in three of the 
so-called presidential ministries: the Ministry of National 
Defense, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs. 
  At a meeting with parliamentary reporters, Kwasniewski also 
said, regarding ratification of the Concordat, that when there 
are just two options--yes or no--the SLD will vote against it. 
  The SLD leader also let it be known that Social Democracy 
has 
given up on the concept of the direct election of village elders 
and town and city mayors in the forthcoming local government 
elections.

  [Text] The Partnership for Peace plan is not an offer of 
alliance. What it offers to European states is cooperation in 
the military and political spheres. This is what Foreign 
Minister Josef Zieleniec said on television. Asked about the 
schedule for the Czech Republic joining NATO, the minister 
replied: 
  [Begin Zieleniec recording] It much depends on the general 
development of the security situation in the world. I think that 
a tacit part of the agreement is that the plan will acquire 
greater dynamism in the event that the situation on the 
continent and also in East Europe deteriorates. On the other 
hand, if developments proceed along the lines of peace and calm 
and if they are heading toward democracy in all East and Central 
European states, there could be some delay. But, in that case, 
there would be no risk to our security. [end recording]. 
  Josef Zieleniec went on to emphasize that the meaning of 
NATO 
is the provision of joint guarantees for a larger entity sharing 
similar interests, values, and way of life. 
  The immediate opening of NATO toward the deep east and 
embracing states where democracy--and I quote--is not fully 
convincing, would be very risky, Minister Zieleniec said.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Robert Casensky: "I am Selling a Tank; Reply </F>
Box No. `Cheaply'"] 
  [Text] At the beginning of this week, reports started to 
circulate again about Czech arms exports to the world's 
high-risk regions. An article published in the most recent issue 
of the weekly RESPEKT, which describes the talks between Skoda 
Plzen Director General Lubomir Soudek and Iranian military 
representatives on modernizing the Soviet T-72 tank and 
supplying other weapons, provided the impetus for this 
discussion. Skoda Plzen is part of the RDP Group, a Czech arms 
consortium. 
  The actual aim of the RDP Group, as put forward by its 
director general, Jan Vlcek, is very positive: to contribute by 
efficient organization to improving the ability to compete of 
our foremost heavy-industrial enterprises, which are affiliated 
in the RDP Group, and to make money to convert arms production. 
According to Vlcek, the production of weapons in the enterprises 
affiliated in the RDP Group should amount to only 20 percent of 
their production program. 
  The hitch, however, lies elsewhere. It is not that Czech 
arms 
production should be abolished, as President Havel suggested 
after his election. It is impossible, of course, to abolish arms 
production immediately. The other side of the coin, however, is 
the offer to modernize tanks right on the spot in countries 
against which a UN arms embargo has been imposed. Even Director 
Soudek himself is not denying the talks on modernizing tanks and 
other arms supplies. 
  Most startling, however, is the fact that these talks are 
taking place with the knowledge of our government. According to 
Vlcek, the appropriate deputy ministers regularly attend 
meetings of the RDP Group's board. It would perhaps be worth 
pointing out that the export of Czech and Slovak arms to 
high-risk countries has on more than one occasion been the cause 
of consternation in Western countries. If Iranian tanks ever 
really are modernized, this could be another major international 
faux pas by our country. Exporting arms or, rather, their spare 
parts to a country such as Iran is not much in keeping with our 
endeavor to attain the position of an exemplary candidate for 
entry into NATO. 
  Let us hope that our government does not think that the 
process for converting the arms industry would be set in motion 
with the debut of the first modernized tank on Iran's borders. 
We can expect, therefore, that the government and, first and 
foremost, Minister Dlouhy, who is responsible for arms exports, 
will adopt as soon as possible a decisive stance on Director 
Soudek's Iranian activities and will, at the same time, consider 
not only the economic aspect but also our reputation in the 
civilized world.

<F P=106> [Pavel Novotny report: "Our Arms Industry Is Focusing on </F>
Exports"] 
  [Text] As Defense Ministry press spokesman Zdenek Borkovec 
told us, the modernization of the T-72 tank is included in the 
long-term plans of the Army of the Czech Republic. It is 
assessing several offers, the one from the RDP Group among them. 
Nevertheless, no agreement has been signed between the Defense 
Ministry and the arms manufacturing consortium. 
  Moreover, Zdenek Borkovec says: "The Defense Ministry is 
considering several alternatives of the modernization of the 
T-72 tank. Because of the high financial requirements of the 
project, the key problems of the solution are being examined 
first. The RDP Group concept does not completely correspond to 
the specified tactical technical demands of the army. The 
aforementioned RDP concept is more export oriented." 
  Currently, 542 tanks of the T-72 series serve the Army of 
the 
Czech Republic. According to Zdenek Borkovec, neither the 
number of tanks to be modernized, nor the time schedule for 
their modernization have been decided. The optimum alternatives 
-- with respect to the future orientation of the transforming 
Czech Army and, above all, the limited financial resources -- 
are to be selected by the end of the year 1994. 
  Regarding the new technical concept of the army, the 
principal document apparently is the "Concept of the Building of 
the Army of the Czech Republic to 1996," which was discussed by 
the government last June. It was decided that in the 
realization of the intended goals, the same system of planning, 
programming and budgeting (SPPR) will be used, as is commonly 
used and accepted in the armies of the North Atlantic Alliance. 
This system, which, according to Zdenek Borkovec, makes the 
processes taking place in the army transparent, and facilitates 
easier monitoring of the army by the parliament, will be applied 
as early as this year. 
  The financing of the armed forces is covered by the Defense 
Ministry chapter of the state budget, which assumes total 
expenditures of 26.792 billion korunas and total revenues of 2.3 
billion korunas. Of the total expenditures, 8.88 billion 
korunas is intended for technical material, of which, 278 
million is earmarked for the purchase of new arms, technology, 
and other material as per the "Concept." 
  The new tank, which should be manufactured in coordination 
with the RDP Group consortium, will allegedly meet the 
requirements of the NATO organization concerning of its member 
states' arms. According to the director general of the 
consortium, Jan Vlcek, a number of the elements -- the 
communication system, for instance -- are compatible with the 
Alliance systems. According to Zdenek Borkovec, however, "the 
notion of compatibility with NATO armies cannot be identified 
with compatibility of arms. It is a logical sequence of certain 
activities in which the compatibility of the equipment has its 
place but it is not a primary one. First, the linguistic, 
planning, communication, and other problems must be overcome. 
Therefore, it is expected that approximately during the period 
until 1996, only a part of the armed forces will be equipped, 
above all, with the modern means of communication, command, and 
reconnaissance." 
  Jan Vlcek claims in the RDP Group statement that one of the 
alternatives of the modernization of the existing tank is 
prepared for the Czech Army as the most important customer. The 
army, according to the aforementioned information, adopted a 
substantially more cautious stand. Exports will apparently be 
necessary for RDP.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Josef Forbelsky: "In the Interest of </F>
Europe's Security"] 
  [Text] It was apparent from the U.S. President's 
"soothing" visit to Prague and from his momentous visit to the 
Kremlin that the United States and Russia will in the future 
"cooperate in the interest of Europe's security." In practice, 
this means that stability on the continent -- and, more broadly 
speaking, its fate -- will be the upshot of cooperation between 
two powers ensconced outside Europe itself. It was confirmed 
that our continent has ceased to be the arena of a possible 
clash between them, but that -- as far as their interests are 
concerned -- it remains divided between them in accordance with 
the outcome of World War II. Compared with past decades, the 
only difference now is that the two super-victors are moving 
away from confrontation, with its risk of mutual destruction, 
toward cooperation. Central Europe should now also infiltrate 
into this concept for cooperation made possible by the collapse 
of the Soviet regime. 
  Of course, as is becoming ever more obvious, the interests 
of 
the Central European countries -- until recently, part of the 
so-called Soviet bloc -- are not completely safeguarded by this 
global plan for U.S.-Russian cooperation. This disharmony is 
due to the fact that their post-war "discomfort" was caused not 
only by Soviet-U.S. nuclear rivalry, which is now being 
eradicated but also by these Central European countries being 
forced to subordinate themselves to unorganized development as a 
result of Europe's partition after 1945, development that ran 
counter to their historical, cultural, and economic existence. 
This pitched them into backwardness from which they now want to 
extricate themselves by a return to the community that 
corresponds to their interests. The possibility of such a 
return is also a crucial condition for their favorable future, 
for their newly open historical perspective. An inconsistency 
between the most intrinsic interests of former Soviet Central 
Europe and the Partnership for Peace plan, which -- a little in 
the style of consultations with Central American republics -- 
President Clinton came to Prague to explain, is foreshadowed 
here. Partnership for Peace gives the Central European countries 
the theoretical possibility of being selectively admitted into 
NATO, an organization guaranteeing their security, only this 
same possibility is also being offered -- without limits -- to 
the whole of the Euro- Asian region, right up to Vladivostok. 
This is the intention of Partnership, because it eradicates the 
mutual Russian-U.S. challenge and creates a basis for strategic 
cooperation. 
  However, as far as the Central European countries are 
concerned, it is obvious that such a broadly proposed plan may 
problematize, if not stymie, their development prospects, 
because it preserves the former Soviet empire in a region 
stretching from Prague to Vladivostok. These countries' 
life-saving trek toward their original European ties, so 
different from their Euro-Asian ones, makes them uncertain. 
This is also at the heart of their anxiety about "the fate of 
the small in the game of the large," which President Lech Walesa 
-- a politician of refined instinct -- expressed so emphatically 
prior to the Prague meeting. Czech policy's solo journey -- in 
this context -- seems more like shortsightedness than foresight. 
If it reckons that the Czech Republic will escape from the cage 
of global power interests thanks to its declared advantages, 
then this is reminiscent of the tragic ingenuity of Edvard 
Benes. Many things imply that the new era of cooperation 
between America and Russia is not evolving merely to allow these 
two powers to rid themselves of the phantom of mutual 
destruction, but also because the two -- not Europe -- have 
analogous, if not identical, interests in relation to the rest 
of the world, first and foremost, Asia, against which they will 
have to measure themselves more and more explicitly. 
  In view of all these circumstances, Central Europe's 
strategic interest is defined differently. It cannot have only 
a U.S. or a Euro-Asian dimension -- except in a tactical context 
-- but just, and only just, a pan-European dimension. Only the 
reassurance of being in its original European environment and a 
thorough reintegration into it can offer the Central European 
countries -- including the Czech Republic -- a suitable 
development perspective. Of course, this presumes that their 
inhabitants will be clear about this aim, that they will take it 
into consideration, and that they will not overshadow it with 
obsolete historical reminiscences. 
  Central Europe, and the Czech Republic in it, cannot now, or 
in the future, function like an uncertain weld in U.S.-Russian 
special-interest cooperation but must concentrate on returning 
to the locus of its historical definition: to the center of the 
European continent. Only in this regenerated unit will it feel 
safe and only here will it be able -- within the framework of 
the European defense, economic, and cultural institutions -- to 
fulfill its own destiny.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Petr Placak: "The Security of the Czech </F>
State"] 
  [Text] It was only a question of when the artificial and 
unnatural division of Europe after World War II -- a division 
forcefully maintained by the Soviet empire in Europe's eastern 
half -- would collapse. This collapse was necessary for the 
normalization of the situation in our part of Europe and the 
search for ways to stabilize it. Our centuries-long experience 
with the existence of the Czech state should help us in our 
efforts. 
<H5>  Western Powers -- Illusion Number One </H5>
  Since the disintegration of the Habsburg-ruled system of 
states and the upsetting of the power balance in Central Europe, 
we have been looking to ensure our security outside the Central 
European space. It is a pure anachronism when people say that 
the only possible way is to return to the pre-war First 
Republic's foreign policy concept and get closer to the Western 
powers -- France, above all. This security system of the First 
Republic not only failed -- as any child knows -- but also 
contributed to Germany's being pushed out of Europe. The 
tragical development after World War I has shown us quite 
convincingly. Today's Germany is a state with great culture and 
enormous economic potential; it is a country (unlike us!) with 
50 years of uninterrupted democratic tradition that was able to 
successfully cope with its Nazi past. Since time immemorial, 
Germany has been our most natural economic, cultural, and 
political competitor (in the positive sense of the word). In 
view of our efforts to integrate ourselves into West European 
security structures -- of which Germany is an inseparable member 
-- any effort to circumvent this reality by jumping over Germany 
far to the West is not only a naive but absurd idea, reminiscent 
of the time before World War II. 
<H5>  NATO -- Illusion Number Two </H5>
  It was unrealistic in the time of the First Republic to rely 
on Western powers in the matter of Czechoslovakia's security, 
and it would be equally dubious to rely on our early joining of 
NATO. There are thousands of things that could slow this process 
down, if not stop it entirely: economic problems in countries 
waiting for membership -- or in the member countries themselves 
-- or unpredictable developments in Russia, which is, of course, 
the most essential thing. Our efforts to join NATO should, 
therefore, be understood as our attempt at keeping what we have 
already achieved (in actual fact, this is not likely to change 
in the future). In our country, we have succumbed, in good 
faith, to the illusion that the Czech Republic has an 
exceptional status among other post- communist countries and 
that we will be the first to be admitted to NATO. However, when 
judging the overall situation in the European security, the 
Alliance may put the Czech Republic's membership in NATO in last 
place on their task list. 
<H5>  Central Europe -- Reality Number One </H5>
  Our first efforts in foreign policy should be aimed, in my 
opinion, at establishing an as-wide-as-possible cooperation with 
our direct neighbors and at our collective building a 
politically stable Central Europe as the basis for the security 
of the Czech state. Cooperation with the Visegrad Four countries 
(plus Austria or Slovenia) does not have to be 
institutionalized, but common interests should be chiefly based 
on wide economic cooperation between these countries, which is 
what the Czech Republic is basically trying to establish within 
the framework of the Central European free trade zone, which 
should also include some military cooperation (for example, 
joint military training with NATO countries within the framework 
of the newly accepted Partnership for Peace project). In no 
case should we look with disrespect at Meciar's Slovakia -- the 
existence of a politically and economically stable country 
between us and the former USSR is in the Czech Republic's vital 
interest! 
<H5>  The Czech State -- Reality Number Two </H5>
  Of course, our domestic development and a quick and 
conflict-free completion of the economic transformation of the 
democratic state are the most important things. The economic 
and political stability and power are the basis for every 
well-functioning society, but we need more than that. We should 
be aware and proud of the fact that we belong to this country 
and state, and that we are part of its 1,000-year-long history.

  "If they will withdraw their troops, I will have to find 
other member states who will be ready to replace them," he said. 
  "The role of the UN is to maintain peace, is to contain a

If you just say they can continue to kill each other, I will 
say that this is an abdication," Butrus-Ghali said. 
  He also expressed confidence in EC mediator Lord Owen, whose 
replacement was demanded Thursday by the European parliament, 
and UN representative Stoltenberg. 
  "I have no criticism, on the contrary. I want to thank them 
for the wonderful work they're doing. It needs a lot of 
patience, of perseverance. I support them and express them my 
gratitude," he said. [passage omitted]

Secretary Douglas Hurd said on Saturday that Western allies 
faced a hard choice of whether to stay on in Bosnia or pull 
their troops out. 
  The decision to go or stay would have to be made, but not in 
the immediate future, REUTERS quotes him as saying in the 
central Bosnian town of Vitez. "It will have to be a very 
substantial weighing up process." 
  Western allies face a tough decision whether to stay in 
Bosnia saving lives and getting aid through, or to pull out, 
leaving a risk of greater savagery, said Hurd after inspecting 
the British troops near Vitez.

  [Text] In connection with yesterday's massacre of six 
Sarajevo children in the Ali-Pasino Polje district, Ejup Ganic, 
a member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, has sent a letter 
to U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  The letter reads: Yesterday afternoon shells fired from Serb 
positions killed six children playing in the snow in front of 
their houses in Sarajevo. Several other children were seriously 
wounded, and doctors are still fighting for their lives. Horror 
of this kind has been going on for 22 months in the besieged 
Sarajevo. Mr. President, is there an effective way to realize 
finally your proposal on lifting the arms embargo against our 
country and on the bombing of Serb positions around Sarajevo? 
You said that you would not tolerate the strangulation of 
Sarajevo. Let us hope that your country will not allow the 
international community's stand on Bosnia-Herzegovina to 
continue being influenced by countries that tolerate genocide 
and reward aggression. 
  This is said in Ejup Ganic's letter to U.S. President Bill 
Clinton.

  [Excerpts] Following the massacre of children in Sarajevo 
yesterday Mustafa Efendija Ceric, Reis Ullema of the Islamic 
community in the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, sent a letter 
to Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i, leader of the Islamic revolution in 
Iran; the great imam (Jaz al-Haq Shayk al-Asad); Mehmet Nuri 
Yilmaz, Reis Ullema of the Islamic Community of the Republic of 
Turkey; and Ahmad Muhammad Ali, the newly elected secretary 
general of the Islamic World League. 
  The letter says: After our fraternal and friendly visit and 
the hospitality you granted us, the delegation of the [Bosnian] 
Islamic Community returned to Sarajevo hoping for peace and an 
end to the tragedy of the Bosnian people. Unfortunately, we 
found only blood and tears in Sarajevo: the blood of innocent 
civilians killed by the aggressor's shells and tears of 
thousands of bereaved mothers, fathers, brothers, and sisters 
who are the victims of evil crimes of the kind the world has not 
yet experienced. [passage omitted] 
  We are not addressing Butrus-Ghali or the European and other 
unions, for they all remain deaf to all our appeals, to the 
screams of innocent people, women and children, coming both from 
the concentration camp in Sarajevo and from farther afield in 
the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  We are not appealing to their consciences any more, to their 
alleged democratic principles and human rights, for we have 
deeply understood that they only deceive the weak ones and lie 
to them. 
  We are informing you as our brothers about the aggressors 
killing innocent children on snow slopes, in front of Europe and 
the world, who are just watching it calmly because the victims 
are Bosnian Muslims, who they [Europe and the world] denied the 
right to self-defense. 
  We are informing you about how we die every day in the most 
awful ways, and demand that you do something, for everyone else 
has betrayed us and abandoned us. We plead with you to come 
here, to visit us while we are still alive, the letter says.

  [Text] President of the Srpska republic Dr. Radovan 
Karadzic visited Vrbas today. On this occasion he informed his 
hosts of the current political situation in the Srpska republic. 
Here is a dispatch by Novi Sad Television: 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter Mileva Tomic] The present 
moment in the resolution of the crisis in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is being marked by a unique absurdity, 
namely, by the Muslim side rejecting the realization of its own 
proposal, President of the Srpska republic Radovan Karadzic 
emphasized when he was explaining the stance of the Serbian 
delegation at the peace talks. 
  [Karadzic] Now we will probably revoke all these proposals. 
In our pocket we have a new platform [word indistinct] for a 
modus vivendi in (?which we shall depart from the factual 
situation). The factual situation is the borders of the Srpska 
republic. They can only be changed through agreement. The one 
who attacks us should receive a fitting reply in accordance with 
the rules of international military law. This is one of the 
possibilities by which we might recall everything that the 
Muslims have gained from us as a sort of concessions. 
  [Tomic] Speaking of the long-term goals of the Serbian 
people on the territory of former Yugoslavia, Radovan Karadzic 
singled out the need for unity and responsible analysis of joint 
interests as the only way of their realization. 
  [Karadzic] I must say that it has always been a great 
concern of ours and that, regardless of what we do, we also 
think of the Serbian Krajina. [Serbian President] Milosevic, 
myself, and my delegation (?have concluded) that it would be the 
best to accept the opening of a bureau of the Republic of 
Croatia in Belgrade, as this would in no way impair Krajina's 
interests, because the bureau of the republic of Serbian Krajina 
and the bureau of the Srpska republic already exist in Belgrade. 
With the bureau of the Republic of Croatia, Croatia is now being 
brought to a completely equal footing with Krajina and the 
Srpska republic; therefore, it did not get any more than the 
Serbian Krajina got. 
  The other thing that we have achieved is that Croatia's 
drawing nearer to the Serbs has de-vilified Serbia. Serbia is no 
longer an aggressor, a demon, and so forth, and here we have 
benefited much more than [Croatian President] Tudjman. 
  [Tomic] The Srpska republic is a real country, Karadzic 
said, 
disorganized as much as any other country in conditions of war, 
but with a clear goal and generally acceptable methods for the 
creation of a free and democratic community of the Serbian 
people. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Belgian General Francis </F>
Briquemont, departing UN Protection Forces commander in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, by an unidentified correspondent in an ice 
rink in Sarajevo on 23 January -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] British General Michael Rose is to take 
over tomorrow from Belgian [General] Francis Briquemont, the 
head of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], who is not hiding his 
bitterness and his misgivings as he leaves Sarajevo. An 
exclusive interview with our special correspondents Jean-Jacques 
Le Garrec and Cyrille Pecheric: 
  [Correspondent] A medal presentation ceremony on an ice rink 
built for the Olympics. But this morning General Briquement is 
a man overwhelmed, like the whole town, by the murderous madness 
that just yesterday wiped out six children playing in the snow 
of Sarajevo. 
  [Briquemont] I have spent hours and hours explaining to the 
belligerents, and especially to the Serbs, that this shelling of 
the town is militarily useless, that it is always a human 
tragedy, and that really as far as international politics is 
concerned it certainly does not improve their image abroad. 
  [Correspondent] Have you yourself also felt humiliated 
during 
your stay here? 
  [Briquemont] Yes, certainly. I can tell you that when you 
have...[pauses] Well, after all I am commander (?in chief); 
when you are a lieutenant general, and when you are stopped at 
checkpoints by men of 18 or 20, who are drunk, and they point 
their guns at you, and you have to wait 30-35 minutes there and 
do not know why, well, you feel humiliated. 
  But I know that all the NCO's [noncommissioned officers], 
all 
the young officers who pass (?these checkpoints) suffer this 
every day too, and I think this is why General Cot made his 
statement on 1 January. I was there next to him, and I share 
[his feelings] entirely. 
  [Correspondent] And how do you respond, or what do you think 
of the decisions to keep removing the generals who end up 
opening their mouths, if I may use the expression? 
  [Briquemont] You know, in my life I have always said what I 
think. I have not stopped doing so as a lieutenant general. 
Perhaps it is true that some politicians, and perhaps some 
highly placed officials in major organizations, do not like us 
saying what we think. But I think that in the UN operations we 
have got to the point where it is no longer the case that we 
have a right to speak, but a duty, because I think we must say 
what is wrong; because it is impossible to continue in these 
conditions. 
  [Correspondent] Do you have one word to leave with the 
people, the people of Sarajevo? 
  [Briquemont] It is true that as I leave Sarajevo I feel 
something of a Sarajevan. I think that if there is a gulf 
between the UN Security Council resolutions and the means we 
have to put them into effect, I think there is a gulf between 
all the political leaders and public opinion, because I think 
the people only want one thing, peace, and for the fighting to 
stop. Let the fighting stop first, and perhaps we shall hold 
discussions afterward, but let the fighting stop. It is a 
completely useless war, and one that I find quite stupid.

  [Excerpt] Kragujevac, 23 Jan (TANJUG)--Momcilo Krajisnik, 
president of the Srpska republic assembly, told Radio Kragujevac 
today that, in its constant efforts to restore peace, the Serb 
side would offer a so-called modus vivendi to the Croat and 
Muslim sides. 
  Explaining what that means during the "Hallmark of Time" 
program, Krajisnik said: "We bind ourselves not to take any 
military action--not even to respond to provocations, although 
that is very difficult--until 10 February. The world should see 
once again who is for war and who is for peace." 
  "We suggest that all front lines be frozen, all military 
activities halted, and relations be normalized. We are 
ready--which is yet another sacrifice on our part--to discuss 
all issues, including those that are completely clear and do not 
cause any problems for us. This is because it is very important 
to restore peace and, by lifting the sanctions, to return to 
life as it was before the war, although the victims cannot be 
brought to life," Krajisnik said. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Sarajevo, 22 Jan (TANJUG) -- We welcome the 
decision of the Duma, the lower House of the Russian parliament, 
which is demanding that Boris Yeltsin lodge an official request 
with the UN Security Council that the sanctions against the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia be lifted, said Momcilo 
Krajisnik, speaker of the assembly of the Srpska republic, to 
TANJUG correspondent Mladen Krsmanovic today. 
  "This will have far-reaching consequences, because it is 
clear now that it is the Muslim side which does not want peace. 
The formal justification for the sanctions was the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Thus, the sanctions can no longer remain in 
place, because the Serb side has demonstrated the maximum degree 
of cooperation and its wish to achieve peace," Krajisnik 
stressed. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] In connection with today's criminal chetnik 
massacre of Sarajevo children, Haris Silajdzic, the prime 
minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina, has sent a letter of protest to 
UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, which says: 
  At the moment when the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] 
commanders for Bosnia-Herzegovina were changing over at Sarajevo 
airport, and on a day said here to be relatively quiet, shells 
were fired from Serb aggressor positions at flats in Alipasino 
Polje [western Sarajevo] where six children were killed, and 
doctors are fighting for the lives of another five. The oldest 
casualty was born in 1981. At the time of this massacre General 
Briquemont was handing over to General Michael Rose. [passage 
omitted] 
  The children who were killed, Mr. Butrus-Ghali, were playing 
in a protected zone, in Klara Cetkin Street, just 200 meters 
from the main UNPROFOR headquarters in Sarajevo. The Serb 
aggressor welcomed the changeover of UNPROFOR commanders for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in a most serious way today -- by killing 
children. What else should happen in Sarajevo before you set in 
motion mechanisms that would lead to the realization of UN 
resolutions? We request that, in keeping with the relevant UN 
resolutions and NATO conclusions, you request that the 
aggressor's positions around Sarajevo be bombarded, the letter 
from Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic says. 
  A letter with the same content was also sent to Karolos 
Papoulias, the president of the European Union Council of 
Ministers, NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner, and Lord 
David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, the cochairmen of the 
Conference on the Former Yugoslavia.

  [Text] Sarajevo, Jan 23 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb Army 
General Milan Gvero on Sunday categorically denied that Bosnian 
Serbs had had anything to do with the massacre of six children 
in Sarajevo's locality of Alipasino Polje on Saturday and blamed 
the outrage on the Moslem leadership. 
  "After checking out with all of our units, I positively 
state 
that no shell whatsoever has been fired for days from our 
positions on the broader area of Alipasino Polje," Gvero told 
TANJUG. 
  "Judging by reports in the Moslem media and the media which 
indiscriminately pick up such reports, the Moslem propaganda 
machinery has again staged another anti-Serb performance," he 
said. 
  Moslem reports say that the shell fired on Alipasino Polje 
on 
Saturday killed six children and one Moslem soldier but "give no 
names of the victims, which may be significant," said Gvero. 
  "If the incident actually took place, and I very much fear 
that it did, then it was nothing but a repetition of the 
breadline massacre in Sarajevo's Vaso Miskin Street in 1992 when 
Moslem criminals and warmongers murdered 16 innocent civilians," 
he said. 
  The speed with which Moslem Premier Haris Silajdzic urged 
Butrus-Ghali to approve air strikes against Bosnian Serb 
positions is indicative of this scenario, said Gvero. 
  "The Moslem propaganda machine has deliberately disregarded 
the opinion of U.N. officials that the perpetrators of the 
incident could not be established, and has been quick to tell 
the world that the deadly shell had come from Serb-held 
nedzarici." 
  "We are sure that the world has woken up to the transparent 
set-ups of the Moslem war propaganda," said Gvero. 
  "This time we have every right to expect the world to 
condemn 
the Moslem leadership for its evidently stage-managed attack on 
its own citizens, who were children in this case which makes 
matters worse, and who were sacrificed to the higher interests 
of war." 
  "We expect protests and condemnation to come also from the 
Moslem people who are being made the collective victim of the 
blind irrationality of their religious leaders," said Gvero.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 24 January carries in 
its regular five-minute newscast four reports on the fighting in 
the republic. 
  Maglaj correspondent Hajrudin Sermic reports that "although 
the attacks of the Chetnik and Ustasha forces have entered their 
fifth day, we can already say that their offensive is a total 
fiasco. Great losses in their ranks have taken their toll, 
although this morning they are perpetrating combined 
tank-infantry attacks on the southern sector of the front, on 
the entire stretch from Bradici to Nekolje. The fighting is 
fierce, but the knights of the 201st Maglaj [Brigade] are 
holding their own. The aggressor army is taking out its rage on 
the civilian population. Howitzer shells of all caliber, mortar 
and tank shells are raining down on Maglaj. Four people, two of 
them children, have been wounded in the past 24 hours. The 
material damage is also great." 
  An unidentified correspondent from the 4th Corps information 
service says that "in the past 24 hours, the free part of Mostar 
Commune has been the site of the fiercest shelling registered in 
the past month. The Ustasha [words indistinct] criminal policy 
with large caliber shells, and destroyed the densely populated 
residential areas. They fired over 160 howitzer, tank, and 
mortar shells at the parts of Mostar controlled by the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 4th Corps. The Ustasha artillery 
targeted the Mostar districts of (?Zelic), (?Padina), 
(?Pazoric), and (?Ceric), while the enemy used antiaircraft 
weapons and snipers against the southern parts of the city. 
There was no peace on the northern part of the Mostar Commune. 
The Ustashas fired around 40 shells from all types of artillery 
weapons at this region. Potoci, (?Krivac), and [name 
indistinct] were targeted. In the south of the Mostar Commune, 
15 120-mm mortar shells were fired at Blagaj, while five 120-mm 
mortar shells landed on Svacici. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 
reconnaissance units have discovered that the Ustasha forces are 
again using captured civilians to dig trenches and reinforce 
their positions. The demarcation lines in the 4th Corps 
operational zone are strong and stable." 
  Brcko correspondent Hamid Deronjic reports that "strong 
Chetnik forces continue to regroup on the Brcko front. 
Concentrations and movements of enemy tanks were again sighted 
last night on the central part of the front, just outside Donja 
Brka. Four truckloads of manpower have arrived in the same area. 
Movements of the enemy's armored vehicles have also been 
sighted in the areas of Sumari and Delina Ravna. Overnight, the 
enemy has been using chain saws to clear the undergrowth and 
make room for his tanks. The enemy's reconnaissance groups were 
intensely active last night in the areas of Cadjavci and 
Omerbegovaca." 
  The studio announcer cites a report by the 4th Motorized 
Brigade information service and says that "there is some 
sporadic artillery fire on the Ilidza front, while Hrasnica, 
Sokolovici, [name indistinct], and Butmir are the scene of small 
arms' provocations."

  [Text] Belgrade, Jan 22 (TANJUG) -- Moslem artillery and 
infantry are on Saturday attacking all Serb localities in 
Sarajevo in civil war wracked Bosnia-Herzegovina, TANJUG learns 
from Bosnian Serb Army sources. The Moslem formations appear to 
be trying, without success, to provoke a major conflict and 
blame it on the Serbs, the sources believe. 
  Moslems are attacking on many fronts throughout that former 
Yugoslav republic, TANJUG learns from the Bosnian Serb Army. 
Moslems are keeping under steady small arms and mortar fire the 
Serb localities and positions in the area of Doboj in the north, 
specifically at Gradacac and on Mts. Ozren and Vlasic. 
  Moslem assaults are continuing also in the east, in the area 
of Gorazde and along the Drina River which forms the boundary 
with Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro). Moslem artillery and 
infantry have intensified operations against Foca in the 
southeast and against Serb defence lines from the directions of 
Olovo, Kladanj and Kalesija in central Bosnia. 
  Bosnian Serb Army sources say that the latest Moslem 
operations are an effort to link up the Moslem enclaves in 
Bosnia and enlarge the territory under Moslem control 
preparatory to linking up with Serbia's region of Raska 
(Sanjak), where half the population is Moslem, and then with the 
Serbian province of Kosovo-Metohija, where ethnic Albanians are 
the majority population.

  The chetniks have continued their offensive on the Maglaj 
front in the zone of responsibility of the Seven-South 
Operational Group [Bosnia-Herzegovina Army]. The size of the 
chetnik losses at this front is illustrated by the fact that 
yesterday our soldiers killed 70 and seriously or lightly 
wounded dozens of chetniks. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Belgrade, Jan 21 (TANJUG)--Muslim troops have 
massacred 11 Croats in a village near Vitez in central Bosnia, 
where a Muslim offensive continues, Zagreb-based Croatian radio 
said on Friday. 
  Bosnian Croat troops (HVO) on Thursday afternoon recaptured 
a 
part of the Buhino Selo village near Vitez, taken by Muslims in 
the latest offensive, and found the bodies of 11 Croats, among 
them of massacred civilians whose hands were tied, Croatian 
radio said. 
  Muslim troops have undertaken a new mobilization in Zenica 
since they plan to launch a new offensive, Bosnian Serb military 
sources said on Friday. 
  The special instructions issued for the mobilization insist 
that as many as possible non-Muslims be mobilized, especially 
Croats, but specifies that their number in units of the 
so-called army of Bosnia-Herzegovina must not exceed five 
percent so that the Muslim character of the units would be 
preserved. 
  According to Bosnian Serb military sources, Vitez and Novi 
Travnik will be the targets of the Muslim offensive. 
  The steel plant in Zenica, a Muslim-held town in central 
Bosnia, has stepped up the production of mortars and artillery 
ammunition. The capturing of Vitez is vital for the Muslim side 
because of the very large quantities of explosives stored there 
and because it would mean the elimination of the last obstacle 
standing in the way of the Muslim side's full political and 
military domination in central Bosnia. 
  It is said that the local bank in Zenica has received 10 
million German marks from abroad for military purchases. The 
Muslim side is now seeking a channel for making the purchases 
and securing their delivery. 
  Muslim forces in central Bosnia have been staging attacks on 
Croat positions around Novi Travnik, east of Travnik, and in the 
western section of the front, at Zepca, according to Croatian 
radio. 
  According to Bosnian Serb military sources, fighting between 
Croats and Muslims continues also in the River Neretva Valley 
and the southern zone of Mostar. 
  In the past 24 hours, Muslim forces continued attacking 
Bosnian Serb positions at Doboj, a town in northern Bosnia, on 
the front north-east of Teslic, in the area of Maglaj, on Mounts 
Ozren and Vlasic, also in northern Bosnia, along the upper and 
central parts of the River Drina in eastern Bosnia, in the area 
of Foca and the area of Cajnice, also in eastern Bosnia, Bosnian 
Serb military sources said on Friday. 
  The movements of smaller infantry and reconnaissance Muslim 
groups, which have been trying to infiltrate the Bosnian Serb 
ranks, have been observed in eastern Bosnia.

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1400 GMT on 21 January carries in 
its regular 26-minute newscast several reports on the fighting 
in the Republic. 
  Reporting on the situation in Maglaj, Hajrudin Sermic says 
that "over 800 shells have so far today landed on the civilian 
targets and the defensive positions. Civilian casualties have 
been reported. The fighters of the 201st Maglaj Brigade are 
heroically defending the free territory. Heavy losses have been 
inflicted on the united aggressor [the Serbs and the HVO], but 
they do not seem to have had enough as their futile attacks are 
still under way now." 
  Mirudin Aldobasic reports from the operational zone of the 
7th South Operative Group that "since this morning the [Serb] 
enemy on the Doboj front has been shelling Matuzici, Mravici, 
Alibegovci, and (Maslinovac). (Omanjska), (Sivsa), 
(Paradaglije), and Kalosevic on the Tesanj front have also come 
under enemy artillery fire." The report says that "since this 
morning the Mt. Ozren Chetniks from their well-known positions 
have been shelling Lijesnica, (Mekolj), (Omezina), and (?Polje 
Plane)." 
  In his report from Bihac, Mirza Sadikovic says that "it is 
relatively quiet here today, but there has been some sporadic 
small arms fire along the front line with the paraformations of 
the so-called Kladusa autonomy." He cites the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 5th Corps Command as saying that "it has 
rejected outright the proposal by the other side on establishing 
demarcation lines and some kind of buffer zones. That is 
unacceptable for two reasons, the 5th Corps statement says. 
First, this is an integral part of the territory of the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and second, no lines or buffer 
zones can divide our people." 
  The studio announcer says that Sarajevo was "relatively 
quiet 
this morning."

  [Excerpts] It was dramatic on the Zepce front this Sunday. 
[passage omitted] 
  Over 1,000 highly destructive shells were fired today from 
tanks, 105-mm and 122-mm howitzers, and mortars deep into the 
[Croat-held] territory and on HVO [Croatian Defense Council] 
positions, and hundreds of explosive devices were also launched. 
[passage omitted] 
  Reliable reports say that 30 jihad warriors [as heard] were 
killed and seven were captured. Three members of the 111th 
Brigade and professional Andrija Tadic Brigade [both HVO] were 
killed and 12 were seriously and lightly wounded. Four 
civilians died and five were seriously wounded in the 
treacherous bombardment [as heard]. 
  Due to the heavy fighting and influx of the wounded the 
situation is dramatic in Zepce hospital. People are dying in 
the corridors and on stretchers, because Zepce has not had 
surgeons, oxygen, and other necessary resources for months.

  [Text] In a letter to UNHCR Sadako Ogata, Mate Boban 
demands urgent deliveries of humanitarian aid to central Bosnia, 
which has been surrounded by the Muslim army for 10 months and 
where a Muslim offensive against the Croat enclaves is under way. 
  The humanitarian situation in the area is a cause for 
concern, Boban says in his letter to the UN high commissioner, 
and adds that almost 100,000 people are facing death by 
starvation. Boban informs Sadako Ogata that in the past 50 days 
each inhabitant of the besieged Croat area in cental Bosnia has 
received less than 4 kg of food. Mate Boban goes on to accuse 
the UNHCR of not delivering humanitarian aid to the besieged 
central Bosnia populated by the Croats, since the Muslim attacks 
in the area have made the Vitez-Busovaca road impassable, and 
the UNHCR has kept silent about this. Boban also says that the 
UNHCR is resuming aid deliveries to Zenica, and that the largest 
part of the aid is taken by the Muslim army. Despite the 
promises given by the UNHCR regarding this, nothing has changed, 
Boban says, and adds that the humanitarian aid is used by the 
Muslim army to continue the war.

<F P=106> [Report by Miladin Manojlovic from Beli Manastir] </F>
  [Text] The second round of elections for president of the 
republic of Serbian Krajina in Slavonija, Baranja, and Western 
Srem passed in perfect order. The response in the five 
electoral units was massive, regardless of the fact that no 
invitations were issued on this occasion and that the weather 
was bad. More than 60 percent of the voters have voted in this 
part of the republic of Serbian Krajina. 
  The electoral commissions are still sorting the data and it 
is not certain yet which of the two candidates for president -- 
Milan Martic or Milan Babic -- has won the trust of the voters. 
  We have learned that it is definite that both candidates won 
numerous votes and that the victory of one or another will be 
very narrow. The president of the republic of Serbian Krajina 
will be the candidate who wins the majority of votes. The first 
unofficial results will be known tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jadranko Prlic, prime minister of the </F>
Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna, by Josko Dadic; place and 
date not given: "If Bosnia-Herzegovina Falls, We Will Join 
Croatia!"] 
  [Text] [Dadic] Let us begin with the most topical issue -- 
the situation in the valley of the Lasva, i.e. central Bosnia. 
How does one intend to help the Croats in besieged enclaves in 
central Bosnia or are they simply sentenced to death? 
  [Prlic] One thing is for sure -- we help those enclaves and 
will keep helping them as much as we can. I cannot reveal 
details on how we intend to help them survive, for everything 
depends on the outcome of present Croat-Muslim negotiations, but 
I can say that it is a combination of political and military 
solutions. 
  [Dadic] Was the attempted breakthrough of the HVO [Croatian 
Defense Council] to reach Novi Travnik via Gornji Vakuf, which 
began when General Roso was appointed commander of the HVO, 
interrupted due to a military failure or as a consequence of a 
political decision? 
  [Prlic] This is a strictly military question and I do not 
want to reveal any details. The fact is that the HVO managed to 
keep their defense line and that HVO units hold some important 
points in that area. 
  [Dadic] Is there a strong possibility that the HVO units 
might blow up the explosives factory in Vitez? 
  [Prlic] Yes, that is a strong possibility. 
<H5>  Muslim-Serb Offensive Is Possible! </H5>
  [Dadic] What is your opinion about the proposal of the 
Croatian opposition to request the Security Council to put the 
valley of the Lasva under UN protection? 
  [Prlic] We officially filed that proposal already five 
months ago, demanding that besieged Croatian enclaves be 
declared safe zones under UN protection, so that this proposal 
of the Croatian opposition does not say anything new. 
  [Dadic] Do you think that, after the possible fall of 
besieged Croatian enclaves, the Muslims and the Serbs could join 
in an attempt to gain access to the sea, regardless of whether 
they will use military or political means? 
  [Prlic] Everything is possible in this war, and that as 
well. 
  [Dadic] The Vance-Owen plan planned to give 24 percent of 
the territory to the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina and after it 
failed, the Owen-Stoltenberg plan talks about 17 percent. It 
seems possible that another plan might give even less to the 
Croats, since they presently militarily hold only 9 percent of 
the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Prlic] I do not agree that the Croats presently hold only 9 
percent of the territory. We control a far bigger territory, 
but the problem lies in the fact that they are not tied into one 
whole. And with regard to the comparison of the Vance-Owen and 
Owen-Stoltenberg's peace plan, many are wrong here, for those 
two plans significantly differ in their content. The Vance-Owen 
plan did not give the Croats 24 percent of the territory but 
provinces where the Croats constituted a majority, which greatly 
differs from what is offered by the Owen-Stoltenberg plan. 
  [Dadic] The fact is that the Croats do not completely 
control a single town. 
  [Prlic] The Croats did not have absolute majority in any 
town. That was the case in Banja Luka, Zenica, Tuzla, and 
Sarajevo, and those are facts we cannot deny. Indeed, the 
Croats made up a large percentage in many towns, but there were 
nowhere a majority, and that is a fact. We consider Mostar the 
capital of the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna, and it is a 
fact that there was approximately an equal percentage of the 
Croats and of the Muslims. In Mostar, the Party of Democratic 
Action was proposed forming the authorities according to the 
principle of parity -- 50:50 -- but the Muslims did not agree to 
that. The Croats never said that Mostar was an exclusively 
Croat town. It does belong to the Croats, but also to other 
nations which live there. 
  [Dadic] Does that mean that Herceg-Bosnian authorities agree 
to divide power in Mostar and thereby give up liberating the 
entire town? 
  [Prlic] It is normal that people who live in that town 
participate in the authorities. You cannot expect the Croats to 
hold 100 percent of the authorities while there are 50 percent 
of the Muslims living in that town. The problem of Mostar will 
have to be solved by its inhabitants, the local population. 
Consequently, in Mostar, there will be no room for all the 
newcomers and refugees who changed the demographic structure and 
who were the main element of destabilization of situation and 
later on caused military conflicts in this town. 
  [Dadic] Can this problem be solved peacefully at all, 
since the Croats and the Muslims are still fighting each other 
in Mostar. 
  [Prlic] That is a quite difficult process, but do we have 
any alternative? 
  [Dadic] In his interview for GLOBUS, Mile Akmadzic, who is 
presently negotiating for the Herceg-Bosnian side, did not give 
a categorical answer to the question whether Mostar would remain 
a part of Herceg-Bosna. 
  [Prlic] Mostar will remain in Herceg-Bosna, that is for 
sure. 
<H5>  What Does S. Praljak's Letter of Resignation Say? </H5>
  [Dadic] Do you still think that the union of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina republics is possible? 
  [Prlic] That is the only remaining possibility to preserve 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as a country. 
  [Dadic] In the event of the final disintegration of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, will Herceg-Bosna join Croatia? 
  [Prlic] Herceg-Bosna will never be the first to leave 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and secede unilaterally. If the union of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina republics is possible, Herceg-Bosna will 
remain a part of Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, if 
Bosnia-Herzegovina should nevertheless disintegrate as a result 
of secession of one of other two republics, then Herceg-Bosna 
would have no alternative but to join Croatia. 
  [Dadic] How true are rumors that Mate Boban will no longer 
be the president of Herceg-Bosna and that Mile Akmadzic will 
take his position? 
  [Prlic] I do not know anything about that. Mate Boban is 
the president of the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna and Mile 
Akmadzic is the minister for international cooperation, and that 
is all I can tell you. 
  [Dadic] Why does Boban no longer participate in 
negotiations? 
  [Prlic] Our foreign minister participated in talks with Mr. 
Granic, and I think that is normal. 
  [Dadic] Why was Slobodan Praljak replaced? 
  [Prlic] Slobodan Praljak resigned from his position as the 
head of the HVO, due to illness, and I personally read his 
letter of resignation. 
  [Dadic] The rumor has it that he left because the Old Bridge 
of Mostar was destroyed. 
  [Prlic] Praljak left before the bridge was destroyed. 
  [Dadic] Will General Roso manage to reorganize the HVO? 
  [Prlic] The process of reorganization is under way and it is 
moving at an optimal rate. We have already had some results, 
but also some difficulties in the process. However, the 
direction of reorganization was defined and we are trying to 
stick to it as much as we can. 
  [Dadic] Is it true that members of the HVO from Kiseljak, 
who allegedly made a few fatal mistakes in defending Vares and 
thereby caused the fall of that town, are to blame for that? 
  [Prlic] No, that is not true. Every time a town is 
conquered or an area is lost, there are rumors that it was 
either sold or betrayed or that someone else is to blame rather 
than those who lived in that town and were supposed to defend 
it. It was very difficult to defend and keep Vares, especially 
since it was attacked by two Muslim corps. Vares had one 
brigade of 1,500 soldiers and a frontline about 60 km long. The 
involvement of the Tuzla corps was here crucial and totally 
unexpected. 
  [Dadic] But, that happened after the atrocities committed by 
Croatian units in Stupni Dol. 
  [Prlic] Yes, and we are making an investigation with regard 
to Stupni Dol and we will reveal its results to the public. But 
there are difficulties in carrying out that investigation, for 
the HVO does not control that area and it is not possible to get 
all relevant information necessary to get the whole picture. 
  [Dadic] When will you pull out the Vares HVO brigade 
"Bobovac," whose men are still practically a buffer between the 
Serbs and the Muslims on the area of several square kilometers 
near Vares? 
  [Prlic] That brigade holds a part of the Vares municipality 
and it is a matter of strategic, military, and other estimates 
how the brigade will be used in the future. 

<H5>    (Un)Controversial Departure for Banja Luka </H5>
  [Dadic] Tell us about future county organization of 
Herceg-Bosna? 
  [Prlic] The Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna will be 
organized in four counties: Herzegovinian-Hum, Zavrsje-Ram, 
Bosnia-Lasva, and the county of Bosanska Posavina. 
  [Dadic] However, politicians from Bosanska Posavina decided 
to establish their own province and thus said "no" to the 
planned county of Bosanska Posavina. 
  [Prlic] There is a large number of refugees in that area, 
approximately 120,000, and it is possible that there are some 
ideas which are not quite realistic. The county of Bosanska 
Posavina has a high level of independence as it always did, but 
there were no people who could perform important functions. 
Regarding stories about autonomy, let me ask the advocates of 
that idea -- autonomy from what? For, autonomy is usually 
founded by a nation which constitutes a minority, which is not 
the case here. Certain processes are going on in Posavina and 
the government is prepared to consider all political options. 
  [Dadic] Your departure for Banja Luka, a couple of months 
ago, was controversial. Not long after you returned, several 
Croats were killed in the vicinity of that town, and a large 
group of Croats were exiled. To what extent are such visits to 
Chetnik centers justified, in your case, the visit to Banja Luka? 
  [Prlic] First of all, that information that some Croats were 
killed is not true. 
  [Dadic] But the Banja Luka Bishop Komarica wrote that in his 
letter. 
  [Prlic] I stay in contact with Bishop Komarica and he is 
really doing his best to improve the position of the Croats 
living in that area in a very difficult situation. I think that 
there have been some results with regard to that. Most 
importantly, the Croats are no longer mobilized into the Serbian 
Army and I think that is an extremely important achievement. In 
most parts, we managed to get free passage for humanitarian 
convoys for the Croats and we are trying to organize a special 
surgery and even a hospital in Banja Luka which would employ 
Croats. 
  [Dadic] What do the Serbs get in return for granting 
concessions for those Croats you mentioned from Herceg-Bosnian 
authorities? 
  [Prlic] Nothing. 
  [Dadic] Nothing? 
  [Prlic] Nothing, this simply a matter of reciprocity, for a 
large percentage of the Serbs live in Mostar and other areas of 
the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna. 
<H5>  No Conflicts With the Church </H5>
  [Dadic] Will the "Serbian republic" and Herceg-Bosna 
recognize each other? 
  [Prlic] Yes, if there is a union of three republics; in that 
case, the mere formation of the union will imply the existence 
of three republics in Bosnia-Herzegovina which will recognize 
each other. 
  [Dadic] We have noticed a rift between the authorities and 
the Catholic Church in Herceg-Bosna. 
  [Prlic] No, there is no such rift. I think that is 
exaggerated. The Church is an institution and we know how 
valuable it is. The Church will stay, and politics will change. 
My view is clear, and I presented it to church officials on 
several occasions -- I am the head of executive authorities in 
the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna, i.e. I implement a 
certain politics and I do not want to be an instrument of the 
Church or to suit their interest, nor will we use the Church for 
realizing certain political interests. 
  [Dadic] Still, the guardian of the Franciscan monastery in 
Siroki Brijeg, father Jozo Zorko, reproaches Herceg-Bosnian 
politicians for avoiding the church, ignoring it, and 
manipulating it today, almost like the communists did before. 
  [Prlic] I have already mentioned instrumentalization and I 
think I was clear enough. Otherwise, one must find faults in 
everything, even in politics, and I am more critical than many 
others with regard to the operationalization of politics and 
functioning of the authorities. However, if we want to retrieve 
the legal system, then we have to support those authorities in 
their attempt to do that. If not, if we criticize the present 
authorities too much, that will lead to chaos and anarchy. 
  [Dadic] To what extent has the Government of Herceg-Bosna 
managed to revitalize the legal system and succeed in fighting 
black-marketing in Herzegovina? 
  [Prlic] Most of those rumors about this area were proved 
unfounded. Today it is obvious that Herceg-Bosna simply served 
as a cover for black-marketing in Croatia. 
  [Dadic] What are the main mistakes of the Herceg-Bosnian 
authorities which caused the loss of a large part of 
Herceg-Bosna? 
  [Prlic] There were mistakes, first of all in the operative 
realization of some functions, both in the army and in other 
segments. However, we must consider the fact that the ratio of 
powers in the war between the Croats and the Muslims is several 
times higher in favor of the Muslims. On the other hand, due to 
information that there would be an agreement with the Muslims, 
as well as due to various negotiations with the Muslim side, 
many military operations were stopped. 
  Still, the main problem was that, outside the Croatian 
republic of Herceg-Bosna, we had seven elite HVO brigades which, 
if they withdrew to the area of Herceg-Bosna, would strengthen 
the defense line and the situation would be quite different. 
But we had no strength for making that political decision, due 
to many factors which should be evaluated in the future. 
<H5>  [Box, p 5] </H5>
<H5>  "Soldiers Blocked the Government!" </H5>
  While we were wrapping up the interview with Jadranko Prlic, 
we suddenly heard heavy marching in the hall and soon also some 
shouting in the office of Prlic's secretary. Prlic thanked us 
for the interview and immediately went out to see what was going 
on. He then went to the conference room with a couple of 
soldiers and his associates. We wanted to leave the building, 
but we were met by a large group of armed soldiers at the 
entrance, who literally blocked the building of the 
Herceg-Bosnian Government. A whole battalion came to protest, 
for they had not received their salaries for three months, and 
its representatives went to talk to the head of the 
Herceg-Bosnian Government. They kindly asked us to go back into 
the building. "Not even Tito-Mate Boban will leave here until 
we get paid," said one of them. Only after an hour and a half, 
after Prlic himself intervened, could we leave the building, but 
no one else, members and personnel of the government, was 
allowed to leave. Agreement was reached only one hour later.

<F P=106> [Octavian Paler editorial: "Searching for Explanations"] </F>
  [Text] It is obvious that the opposition has decided to 
leave aside the nebulous sphere of principles and to take the 
practical and decisive step of holding out its hand to the 
current power, with a view to taking the country out of the 
crisis. The representatives of the Democratic Convention [CDR] 
overcame their doubts and went to the meeting at Cotroceni 
[presidential palace] with the offer to form a new governmental 
coalition. The only nonnegotiable condition they put forward 
was that the coalition should distance itself from the extremist 
parties. It became equally obvious that this hand was turned 
down in more or less polite terms. Probably surprised by such 
an unequivocal offer, Ion Iliescu found no better solution than 
to repeat his vague remarks about the "political pact" to which 
he is inviting the parties, thus proving that he does not really 
want a solution to the crisis through sharing power with the 
opposition, but rather a political "hora" [Romanian folk dance] 
around the crisis. The end of the Cotroceni meeting looked like 
a display of all cards out on the table, with the recognition of 
the fact that the negotiations were a bluff. 
  Less clear is why Ion Iliescu does not want to hear anything 
about the current suffering of the Romanians and the poor 
administration of the country in the years that have elapsed 
since the revolution. Does he really believe that everything is 
linked to some fatalistic notions and the hardships of 
transition? Now, when we are much worse off, not only compared 
to the Poles, Czechs, or Hungarians, but also to the Bulgarians, 
who are also in a transition process, we cannot find another 
explanation for such beliefs -- without feeling offended -- than 
that the president has lost all contact with reality. Then, it 
is also not at all clear why Ion Iliescu stubbornly ignores the 
disastrous opinion of the majority of the population about 
Vacaroiu's government and why he still does not fear an alliance 
of the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] with the 
extremist parties, in the light of the international uproar 
around Zhirinovskiy's circus. Is is possible that nothing 
matters -- not even the country being brought to ruin by an 
incompetent and corrupt government and not even the reticence of 
the outside world -- when the interests of personal power are at 
stake? Ion Iliescu has let us understand that all he wanted was 
a pact through which all the political forces would side with 
those who are administering the catastrophe. His secret dream 
seems to be to turn political pluralism into a kind of 
ideological federation or national symposium, where everybody 
comes up with his ideas and throws them together into the pile, 
after which they pledge to no longer have any other objections. 
He seems to dismiss the fact that the role of political 
pluralism in the democratic world is to ensure a governing 
alternative and a competition of programs, not an amalgam of 
strategies. But then, we want to be original at all costs, 
don't we? Here comes up, in a new version, the old idea of a 
"front," within which one can argue over details, as long as the 
minority subordinates itself to the majority. 
  At the level of the end results, things are rather clear. It 
is the cause that is more unclear. How can one explain the 
negative answer that came from Cotroceni? It is not easy to 
find an explanation to that, since there might be several. 
  1. Ion Iliescu is the spokesman (some say "the prisoner") of 
certain forces that do not want a change, but rather the 
consolidation of the restoration; this should be done quietly, 
and if one can no longer have the graveyard quiet of Ceausescu's 
days, at least it should be the quiet of resignation. 
  2. Ion Iliescu is convinced that he has become master of the 
situation and can now afford to ignore all suffering and 
discontent. 
  3. Ion Iliescu feels more secure amid the insults and 
flattery coming from the extremist parties than alongside 
certain parties that talk too much about truth, reform, and 
Europe. 
  4. Ion Iliescu cannot overcome his resentment toward the CDR 
leaders, who have often criticized him. Consequently, anything 
the Convention offers him, except applause, should be rejected. 
  5. Ion Iliescu cannot escape the limits of his 
Gorbachev-like thinking. 
  In the end, regardless of what the cause may be, to defend 
the morass into which we are sinking is a dangerous game.

<F P=106> [Article by Anton Uncu: "Our Leaders"] </F>
  [Excerpt] We Romanians say that whenever God wants to 
punish someone, he first makes them go out of their mind. After 
that, there is no need to punish them any further for their sins 
because they will punish themselves anyway. In this sense, the 
case of Adrian Nastase [executive chairman of the Social 
Democracy Party of Romania, PDSR, and speaker of the Chamber of 
Deputies] can be very eye-opening. Ever since the [December 
1989] revolution, he has been trying to portray himself as a 
democratic, intelligent, impartial, and so on politician. And 
why should we not admit that he really has all the necessary 
prerequisites to become what he wants to be. He can speak 
eloquently, he is calm, he has a good memory, good looks... 
However, for some reason unknown to us, the speaker of the 
Chamber of Deputies recently lost his memory. He has forgotten, 
for instance, that a month ago, he told correspondents that the 
party he represents would never accept the blackmail of PUNR 
[National Romanian Unity Party], which, at that time, 
conditioned its cooperation [with the ruling party] on being 
offered a number of ministerial portfolios. Nastase's 
indignation seemed real and worthy of our respect. However, a 
few days ago, the official PDSR leader changed his views. The 
PUNR blackmail does not concern him in the least; on the 
contrary, he ceremoniously announced that the PDSR and PUNR have 
established an alliance intending to govern the country. The 
portfolios, which a month ago he considered to be the motive of 
the blackmail, are included, of course -- at least, this is what 
we think. The whole thing reminds us of a great Romanian lawyer 
who manages to prove that the defendant is a scoundrel who 
should be sent to jail, after which, within a few minutes, he 
also manages to demonstrate that he is as innocent as an 
angel... In today's Romania, this is how the official leader of 
the ruling party turns black into white and white into black, 
turning the whims of a spoiled child determined to ruin the toy 
he has just received as a present into a political act. The toy 
is nothing but Romania's Government, the leadership of which is 
also coveted by the man who rings the bell in the hall of the 
Chamber of Deputies... [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Viorel Salagean, Romanian National Unity </F>
Party senator, by Simona Popescu; place and date not given: 
"For the Time Being PUNR Appears in the Political Arena as an 
Extremist Party"] 
  [Text] [Popescu] Mr. Gheorghe Funar [president of the 
Romanian National Unity Party -- PUNR] affirms that your recent 
declarations stem from the fact that you have not been chosen to 
participate in negotiations with the PDSR [Social Democracy 
Party of Romania] or for the meeting at Cotroceni.... 
  [Salagean] Mr. Funar makes many affirmations and all of them 
in his characteristic style that he always uses in public. 
However, I believe that this time he has been misinformed. In 
any event, he cannot be correctly informed about my activity 
because he is in Cluj and I am in Bucharest. 
  [Popescu] President Funar explains your statements by saying 
that you have been sick for a few months. 
  [Salagean] We are not talking about statements that might be 
connected to a situation when I was allegedly annoyed for some 
reason. There is only one thing that really upsets me and that 
is stupidity. And when stupidity crosses my path and I cannot 
avoid it, then I try to push it forcefully aside. Let me 
explain this. There was no question of my being excluded from 
those negotiations. I must draw the attention of Mr. Funar and 
of those who believe in the words spread by him to the 
following: The first discussions that I held on the PUNR's 
participation in the government took place at the beginning of 
September 1993 and three people participated in them, namely, 
[PUNR Vice President] Ioan Gavra, [PUNR Deputy] Valeriu Tabara, 
and myself. The talks were held in the the prime minister's 
office. After we had presented him with certain aspects of our 
policy and also named a few ministries that we were interested 
in, he suggested that the discussions should not continue at 
that stage with the government but should rather be transferred 
to the two parties. Thus, the discussions continued with the 
FDSN [Democratic National Salvation Front, now the PDSN] 
leaders. Therefore, I participated in the initial stage of 
these negotiations. As far as my alleged annoyance about the 
nonparticipation in the Cotroceni talks is concerned, such 
rumors are no novelty. There was no question of annoyance 
whatsoever. I stated that I did not want to participate in 
those talks with the president in Mr. Funar's presence, because 
I do not want to blush when I hear original political 
fabrications uttered in front of the country's president. I 
have respect for that institution. 
  [Popescu] As far as we know, until recently, even the 
Cotroceni itself imposed an embargo on PUNR President Funar. 
  [Salagean] I do not know what his relations are with the 
Cotroceni. However I know that when I participate in 
negotiations, I do not want to blush in shame for statements 
that I hear uttered by my colleagues in the talks. This time 
the PUNR's Bureau probably took into consideration this past 
principle of mine to refuse to participate in PUNR meetings at 
the presidency when Mr. Funar is present. This is the true 
story. Certainly I would have liked, exceptionally, to 
participate in the latest meeting because I had something to say 
in front of the president, namely, to tell him not to commit the 
error that has already been circulated and that has started to 
take shape, that is, discussing PUNR participation in the 
government. Such a political act could disrupt all the 
political forces in our country in the present circumstances. I 
shared these thoughts with some of my colleagues and that may be 
the explanation of why I was not included in the talks. 
  [Popescu] It seems that the PDSR and the PUNR have already 
established the latest details. 
  [Salagean] Unfortunately, I notice with the greatest 
surprise that the discussions between the PDSR and the PUNR are 
being kept very secret, mainly from certain senators and 
deputies. However, they are not being kept secret from the 
press and other parties. I have learned from the press what the 
PUNR's demands are. They have named four or five ministries and 
I was surprised to see this, as I know that we have no adequate 
people for any of those ministries. Our offers -- and please do 
not ask me to name names because I will not do so -- were 
circulated in the press and I suppose that these are indeed the 
ones, but I do not want you to hear them from me. Those people 
are below the level of being able to compete with those who 
currently occupy these positions, that is, the ministerial 
portfolios. Thus, this is the major reason why I think that the 
offer of the PUNR is frail, very weak, and lacking in 
consistency. 
  [Popescu] In this case, the PUNR's request to participate in 
the government was mainly based on vanity? 
  [Salagean] I believe that currently -- to use the familiar 
phrases -- there are a few PUNR people who want to be in the 
government, having already entered the Senate and the Chamber of 
Deputies, or becoming prefects, subprefects, or I do not even 
know what kind of important post, such as general directors in 
certain ministries or secretaries of state. They want by any 
means possible to see themselves, at least for a week or two, a 
month, or perhaps even a year as a minister. Certainly, we are 
talking here more about vanity than the desire or the power to 
do anything useful for the country. In addition, you should not 
forget that accepting the PUNR in government or establishing a 
biparty government structure -- I believe -- would be a real 
danger, a very bad signal sent toward Europe. No matter what we 
want to do, no matter how we want to change our image, for the 
time being the PUNR appears in the political arena to be an 
extremist party. However, I refuse to believe that the PUNR is 
in its structures an extremist party. But, through its leaders 
and through the attitude of those leaders -- and in this respect 
I am primarily thinking of Mr. Funar -- through many of his 
willful and irresponsible attitudes and hasty gestures and 
actions, the PUNR is burdened with this label of an extremist 
party. 
  [Popescu] How representative is the current PUNR 
leadership? 
  [Salagean] I would like to believe that for the spirit of 
the PUNR, Mr. Funar is not in the least representative. His 
declarations and actions, at least the most recent ones, are 
either made on his own behalf, or by a furious person, or they 
are those of the mayor of Cluj. Many senators whom I know very 
well distance themselves from those declarations as soon as they 
are uttered. It is absolutely necessary to make changes in the 
PUNR leadership. Otherwise, there is the danger that the PUNR 
will join and discredit this government, which can hardly stand 
upright. But, there is also the danger that the PUNR will be 
continuously discredited by Mr. Funar's willful attitude. I 
believe that we should not now unnecessarily stir up nationalism. 
  [Popescu] What will you do if Mr. Funar's removal from the 
PUNR's leadership is not successful? Will you resign? 
  [Salagean] I am not one to give up a fight. I feel capable 
of fighting, and I am not ill as Mr. Funar has implied with his 
characteristic cynicism. In any event, he may not know it, but 
a heart attack has nothing to do with mental disease, from which 
many of the current leaders of this party suffer. I believe 
that Mr. Funar will understand the current danger that faces the 
PUNR mainly because of his willful and hasty gestures and he 
himself will find the solutions. One of these would be to 
resign and to devote himself to his mayor's office in Cluj. 
Another might be to convene an extraordinary congress of the 
party and to discuss all the issues openly, without arrangements 
of the type made at the time when Mr. Radu Ceontea [former PUNR 
leader], who was one of the founders of the party -- and he 
certainly had his own failings -- was removed from the political 
scene of the PUNR and a person like Mr. Funar, who has brought 
much, very much disrepute onto the party, should be kept at the 
helm. Common sense would compel us to make a decision in this 
respect. 
  [Popescu] According to your information, are there many 
members of your party who share your ideas? 
  [Salagean] I have never carried out an opinion poll in this 
respect, but, knowing very many PUNR members, I believe that 
common sense will force them to move to my side and support the 
idea of changes within the PUNR. 
  [Popescu] Recently we were informed that President Iliescu 
wants to use you to eliminate the PUNR from the negotiations. 
Similarly, it is known that the PDSR at one point set conditions 
for the continuation of the negotiations, namely the removal of 
Mr. Funar. 
  [Salagean] This is an interesting interpretation; I have 
never thought of this. I would like to state very clearly that 
I have held no discussions whatsoever in the past year with any 
person connected with the Cotroceni. Such an interpretation 
would certainly be a forced one and I deny it because I had no 
contacts whatsoever, not even with Mr. Adrian Nastase. On the 
contrary, I would like to say that, the most violent attack on 
Mr. Nastase, when he made those statements about the behavior of 
certain PUNR leaders and suggested the need for a change of 
mentalities within the PUNR, which was aimed at controlling Mr. 
Funar, and even suggested his removal, may have been from me 
when I intervened most forcefully at the news conference, saying 
that we do not accept anybody interfering in our affairs. There 
I defended the idea of the independence of a party. We rejected 
the idea of making little signs to signal that "it is not good 
what you are doing." But it is certain that we basically agreed 
with Mr. Adrian Nastase! Changes can start within the PUNR only 
through an internal impetus, not an external one. I can state 
categorically that such an interpretation is completely 
erroneous. I also have many fundamental criticisms of President 
Iliescu. One of them is connected with current events. I have 
understood that President Iliescu is separating two elements 
that should complement each other concerning the negotiations at 
the Cotroceni, the move toward a political pact and the move 
toward a new government. These two things cannot be separated. 
Otherwise, it means nothing more than a dialogue between the 
deaf.

  [Text] During today's news conference of the Socialist 
Party of Labor [PSM], Deputy Chairman Tudor Mohora presented the 
stance of his party regarding the recent negotiations between 
the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] and the PUNR 
[National Romanian Unity Party] intended to set up a coalition 
government and the talks among the parties that support the 
current government, which concluded on Friday [21 January] 
evening. 
  The PSM believes that the negotiations between the PUNR and 
the PDSR should be continued and concluded. Regardless of their 
outcome, those negotiations have had a beneficial effect so far 
in the sense that they have highlighted the need to clarify 
relations among the ruling party and the parties that support 
the government, Mohora emphasized. 
  As far as the PSM is concerned, that party is not interested 
primarily in who the new members of the government will be, but 
rather in the way the new executive will govern. In that sense, 
the PSM has said that an agreement should be concluded in 
writing among all the parties supporting the new government. 
The document should establish the way and the means by which 
they will support the act of governing. The PSM has also 
requested that an anticrisis program should be urgently 
elaborated. 
  During the talks that concluded last Friday they also 
proposed the establishment of a political pact that should be 
open for all parties, regardless of whether they are represented 
in parliament or not, which should comprise a number of 
political ideas that are acceptable for all, without, however, 
being connected to the act of government. 
  Mohora also mentioned the fact that, during the talks last 
Friday, the idea emerged to set up an alliance of the parties 
that support the government and they discussed the possibility 
of establishing a multi-color government in the long run. 
  In the conclusion of the news conference Mohora announced 
that PSM Chairman Ilie Verdet is currently in Paris, where he is 
attending the proceedings of the French Communist Party 
congress. During their stay in France the PSM leaders intend to 
contact left-wing political groupings from other countries, our 
correspondent Anca Ionescu reports.

  [Text] The future coalition government [between the Social 
Democracy Party of Romania, PDSR, and the National Romanian 
Unity Party, PUNR] will not survive more than three months, 
emphasized Corneliu Coposu, National Peasant 
Christian-Democratic Party [PNTCD] chairman, during today's 
weekly news conference. Coposu based his assertion on the fact 
that the participation of the PUNR in the new government will 
ensure the country neither stability at home nor credibility 
abroad. The PNTCD chairman also stressed the fact that, judging 
from the information he holds, the West considers the PUNR to be 
an expression of extremism that exceeds even that of the Greater 
Romania Party [PRM]. In the same context, Coposu assessed that 
the new government formula will lead to restoration and the 
blocking of reform. 
  PNTCD Spokesman Radu Vasile assessed that a situation will 
be 
created that everyone thought had been brought to an end in 1989. 
  Talking about the rejection of the opposition's offer to 
assume the responsibility of governing, the PNTCD leaders 
considered it natural that the Socialist Party of Labor [PSM] 
and the PRM will also be included in the executive, as those 
parties support the current government, our correspondent Elena 
Perdichi reports.

<F P=106> [Article by Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky: "Partnership </F>
for Peace -- Slow Return to the West"] 
  [Text] In the period of the cold war, most Hungarians -- 
including me -- saw NATO as the symbol of hope that communism 
would not prevail in the West and, as a result, we would also 
one day regain our freedom. For 45 years, NATO has successfully 
preserved peace and the Euro-Atlantic system of values, and it 
introduced the spirit of cooperation in a Western Europe torn 
apart by war. 
  These achievements should also spread to the eastern part of 
Europe. Hungary and other Central European countries would like 
to see guarantees that the changes of 1989-1990 are irreversible 
and that their return to the western world is taking place in an 
institutional framework, and not only through momentary, 
economic and political relations. Given the fact that there are 
no chances of gaining full membership in the European Union 
before the end of this decade, NATO is the only organization 
that can facilitate a rapid and secure implementation of our 
goals. Today, Central Europe can be compared to some kind of 
no-man's-land where, in addition to the threat of 
neo-imperialism, which cannot be totally excluded, economic and 
environmental security are not guaranteed either. Hungary must 
join the well-functioning Western structures to encourage 
foreign investments and an increase in the number of tourists, 
and to strengthen confidence in Hungary. We are at most halfway 
through the implementation of these goals. 
  At the Copenhagen summit held in June 1993, the Council of 
Europe set out the goal of opening up toward the East. Six 
Central and Eastern European countries signed partnership 
treaties with the European Union; two of them, the treaties 
signed with Hungary and Poland, will come into force as from 1 
February 1994, and the ratification of the other treaties is 
currently under way. A similar decision emerged at the NATO 
summit in Brussels on 10 January 1994: The "Partnership for 
Peace" program makes it clear that the countries that are 
successful in this cooperation could hope for NATO membership. 
At his meeting with the Visegrad four on 12 January 1994, U.S. 
President Bill Clinton confirmed that the security of Central 
Europe is also vital for the security of the United States. 
  I think this view is not completely in harmony with the 
spirit of the Partnership for Peace program. Although 
Washington mostly accepted Moscow's position, the decisions made 
in Brussels and Prague offer more advantageous opportunities for 
Central Europe than a mere relocation of the former Iron Curtain 
more to the East. Our region, which was the scene of two world 
wars, does not want to be a border area or a battle ground 
again. A partnership relation between NATO and Russia is much 
more important for us than mere NATO membership for Hungary and 
having to face an big enemy power. Therefore, it is better to 
wait, although this also has its risks. 
  As for the various criticisms regarding the Partnership for 
Peace plan, this peace partnership does not refer to everyone: 
While the "self-selection system" awards the pioneers and the 
good students, it is also an encouragement to those who have 
fallen behind. The Brussels decision helps both Ukraine and 
Russia, and we are particularly glad that the recent 
Russian-U.S.-Ukrainian agreement on nuclear weapons received a 
new impetus in Hungary on 18 December 1993, when Leonid Kravchuk 
and Al Gore met here on the occasion of the funeral of the late 
Hungarian prime minister. 
  The meeting in Prague strengthened the Visegrad and Central 
European cooperation, something that has had priority for 
Hungary since 1990, and the recent U.S position also 
strengthened this. 
  The other argument against expanding NATO says that the 
conflicts between some countries that want to join NATO would 
weaken the alliance. This excuse is unfounded. Organizations 
like the national minority chief commissioner of the Council of 
Europe or the CSCE are capable of coping with this problem, like 
the tensions deriving from the situation of 3.5 million ethnic 
Hungarians living on the territory of our neighbors, people who 
feel that the majority of the population shows hostile feelings 
toward them and their rights are not guaranteed. Together with 
the European Union and the Western European Union, NATO will 
contribute to the development of a more favorable atmosphere, to 
the solving or at least the easing of these tensions. At the 
same time, if the behavioral norms prevailing in Western Europe 
since the end of World War II spread to Central and Eastern 
Europe and penetrate the political elite, the armed forces, and 
the youth, the existing tensions might decrease considerably. 
  We think that the Partnership for Peace program is the way 
that leads directly to NATO, and we are striving to make use of 
every opportunity for cooperation, whether political, 
diplomatic, consultative, military, logistic, or any other 
opportunity. We admit that full membership must be preceded by 
a long preparatory process, but we are convinced that we will 
fulfill the NATO demands in a few years. Our commitment is 
clear. From this moment, what have become the basic questions 
of our security policy are when and how.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky by </F>
unidentified program announcer; place and date not given; from 
the "Morning Dialogue" program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Announcer] From today it is possible to sign 
the framework agreement of the so-called Partnership for Peace 
in Brussels. It is believed in Brussels that the affected 
countries are in quite a rush. Lithuania, for example, would 
like to sign the document within days, and its prime minister 
himself will go to Brussels to sign. Our guest is Foreign 
Minister Geza Jeszenszky, who, according to reports last 
weekend, will sign the accord personally. However, last weekend 
there also appeared rather different assessments about the 
accord. Increasingly more people believe that this agreement is 
really a success for Russia and not for the Central European or, 
if you like, the Visegrad Group of countries. 
  [Jeszenszky] I do not agree with the view which holds that 
it 
is not our success. Last October, when Warren Christopher 
presented this program to Hungary and the world for the first 
time, it was much more modest than the current one. It did not 
contain -- or did only very hazily -- the promise of NATO 
membership, whereas now the door is open. For Hungary, NATO 
membership is not the only possible way of legally joining 
Western structures but perhaps the fastest and safest one. 
[passage omitted: benefits, chances of membership] 
  [Announcer] Has a concrete date been fixed for you to go 
Brussels and sign the accord? 
  [Jeszenszky] This is not a horse race. I do not consider it 
important as to who overtakes whom. In any case, Hungary -- 
which has played quite a significant role in working out the 
draft -- will surely be among the first. I do not mind signing 
simultaneously with others. [passage omitted] I do not know the 
concrete date, but I think that the signing will take place 
within a good couple of weeks. 
  [Announcer] You visit Belgrade this week. What will you take 
with you, for, after all, Hungary's relations with Serbia, or to 
be more precise, rump Yugoslavia are, to put it mildly, not very 
good. [passage omitted] 
  [Jeszenszky] [passage omitted] For Hungary, the end of the 
conflict is very important. [passage omitted] The Danube, as a 
free waterway, is of vital importance, and then there are the 
Hungarians in Vojvodina, who are under threat. Really, the aim 
of this visit is to demonstrate again that our objective -- 
ever since the formation of this government -- is to carry out a 
balanced policy toward all our neighbors, including the 
Yugoslavs. [passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] Is there a thawing in the Belgrade-Budapest 
relationship? 
  [Jeszenszky] I can say that the outbursts which could be 
described as regular, have ceased -- quietened down -- in the 
Belgrade press. These were the most impossible tales: That 
there are training camps in Hungary; that Hungary, in 
cooperation with Croatia, is arming the neighbors. [passage 
omitted] These reports, which were manufactured for domestic 
consumption, have now ceased. 
  It is also important that the most innocent victim of the 
embargo, the civil population -- and even within this group, 
those who have nothing to do with the policy which provoked the 
embargo, such as the Vojvodina Hungarians, for example -- should 
survive this period. [passage omitted on Hungarian humanitarian 
aid deliveries]. The first task is to ensure the survival of, 
and the second task is the achievement of the political 
recognition of, the Vojvodina Hungarians. We have some hopes in 
respect of the latter and I would like to investigate this. 
  [Announcer] What do you mean by political recognition? 
  [Jeszenszky] Recently, several contacts have taken place 
between the Democratic Community of the Hungarians in Vojvodina 
[VMDK] and the Serb leadership. I think that the VMDK does not 
wish to make use of this difficult situation -- i.e., that the 
Hungarians can tip the scales between the Serbian Socialist 
Party and the enemy [ellenseg] -- either by entering the 
government or to form a coalition with a very heterogenous 
opposition which includes, inter alia, extremist radicals. 
However, in any case, the VMDK's responsible behavior will 
perhaps slowly achieve certain results and the political plans 
of the Hungarian population -- the various autonomy concepts, 
i.e., that it is a political factor [szubjektum] whose affairs 
must be sorted out -- have a certain chance of succeeding. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] Last week the Slovak Foreign Ministry attacked 
you for saying in an interview in a Polish newspaper that there 
is no border question between Hungary and Slovakia. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Jeszenszky] I do not think that it was for this sentence 
that I was attacked -- only very bigoted people could attack me 
for it. However, what I said was very much in line with, e.g., 
the stand of the Hungarian grand assembly [nagygyueles], the 
government assembly [kormanyzati assembly] in Komarno [Komarom], 
too. 
  This attack is an artificial incitment to hysteria, or 
serves 
domestic political purposes. [passage omitted] The long 
interview contained but a mere half-sentence reference to the 
fact that certain of our neighbors, Slovakia and Romania, do not 
fulfil the expectations of the Council of Europe, their own 
promises. [Slovak] Foreign Minister Moravcik knows very well 
that this is a fact. The fact that he comments in an elaborate 
way on my statement shows precisely that Slovakia would like to 
divert attention to what is taking place there. 
  [Announcer] In Hungary, several political forces are calling 
for a referendum to be held regarding Partnership for Peace, 
since it is such an important issue that it cannot be decided 
without asking the people. What is your view on this? 
  [Jeszenszky] I believe no referendum is planned regarding 
the 
Partnership for Peace program in its narrow sense. 
Parliamentary ratification will only become necessary if 
Hungarian troops were sent abroad or foreigners took part in 
Hungarian military exercises. If the agreement includes such 
details then we will submit it to parliament. Consultation is 
continuous with the parliamentary parties regarding these issues. 
  NATO membership is a different matter. [passage omitted] 
NATO provides absolute security, since it represents a force 
which can deter small and large aggressor from making an attack. 
Therefore I believe that the closest possible relationship with 
NATO is in Hungary's unequivocal interest. I do not believe 
that a referendum is justified from this point of view. It is 
also very expensive. [passage omitted] 
  I believe there will be no need for a referendum after the 
forthcoming elections, but each party should state clearly 
before the elections what their stand is regarding NATO. The 
Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] advocates NATO membership, so 
those who want NATO membership in Hungary should vote for the 
MDF, and those who are afraid of NATO membership should vote for 
other parties.

<F P=106> [Article by Washington correspondent Oszkar Fuzes: "The </F>
United States and Eastern-Central Europe -- The Consequences of 
Clinton's Tour on Hungary and the Region"] 
  [Text] In accordance with reality, Washington 
differentiates between individual countries and groups of 
countries in Eastern Europe. Russia is important from a global 
policy viewpoint, and the United States regards the success of 
Russian reforms as the pillars of the new world order. As for 
the other former Soviet republics, the United States finds it 
important that Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan discard their 
nuclear weapons and the others stay "clean." If, as it 
promised, Moscow honors the independence of the new states, it 
will be able to emerge as a crisis manager, or even a judge with 
U.S. approval. 
  Washington is for regional cooperation in the case of both 
the CIS and Eastern Europe. Despite all the Czech opposition, 
Washington supports and encourages the Visegrad cooperation as 
well. Prague, Warsaw, Budapest, and even the "immature" 
Bratislava are treated uniformly and placed in the same drawer 
of "local affairs" in the big global policy cabinet. Clinton 
lifted the ban on the purchase of U.S. weapons to all the four 
countries simultaneously, and Christopher also made it clear 
that the door leading to NATO can either become wider or 
narrower for these countries. They must prove their democratic 
maturity in solving their bilateral conflicts. Clinton 
specially remarked that violent nationalism and anti-Semitism 
are unacceptable for the United States. He did not hide the 
fact that the United States is providing greater political and 
economic support to the new democratic countries in order to 
help avoid the renewal of totalitarianism. Talbott added that 
the United States does not want to be the judge in the conflicts 
of small countries. Nor will the United States take it upon 
itself to "put in a good word" for them in Moscow. In case of a 
possible revival of the Russian threat, something that 
Christopher definitely regards as only a possible supposition, 
the Visegrad countries can count on U.S. security policy help " 
to be defined at the proper time." Perhaps this does not seem 
to be a big thing -- Christopher said -- but this is a very 
serious responsibility on the part of the NATO. It exceeds the 
mere consultations. If these countries get deeper into the 
peace partnership, conduct military exercises together with us, 
and make military plans together, then we will have relations 
with them in which their security will become very important for 
us. If someone turns back, we can again drop the security 
barrier used in the past, although we would definitely not like 
to draw a separation line in Europe again. The Russian leader 
who claims that we promised Moscow not to allow anyone into NATO 
is making a big mistake, Christopher said. 
  Christopher's deputy Talbott places emphasis on a slightly 
different thing: "The real integration of Western, Central, and 
Eastern Europe is a very long process. Just like the Russians, 
we also fear that Moscow could again become isolated from the 
outside world. This does not mean that Yeltsin gets a veto 
right in the possible extension of NATO, but we will definitely 
take the viewpoints of the Russian reform into consideration," 
Talbott said. 
  Behind the Visegrad goup, there are the other Eastern 
European countries. Most of them have not yet fulfilled the 
preliminary conditions of the peace partnership. (Civil and 
parliamentary control over the army is not firm enough, the 
military budget is not completely public and regulated, unsolved 
territorial issues might emerge, and the civil democracy is not 
stable enough). Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, and Macedonia are 
in this drawer; in addition, these countries are important for 
the foreign policy makers in Washington not because of 
themselves but because of the Yugoslav crisis. 
  Given certain U.S. global strategic considerations, the same 
makes Albania slightly special. NATO could get access to an 
important port at Durres. Besides, Albania is an excellent 
place for "keeping an eye" on the Balkans. The third exception 
is the most developed country in the region, namely Slovenia, 
which, to its misfortune, is still regarded as a former member 
of Yugoslavia by the the United States and it is not part of the 
Visegrad group. (In addition, Slovenia could have a border 
debate with Croatia.) 
  Small Yugoslavia is last on the list and, together with 
Bosnia, they are treated in a global policy connection rather 
than an Eastern European connection. In Brussels, NATO 
presented three conditions for the Serbs to avoid possible air 
strikes: 1. The aid convoys must be allowed to enter 
Srebrenica. 2. The Tuzla airport must be opened. 3. The 
"strangling" of Sarajevo should end. These are the most clearly 
formulated conditions, but who would be certain that the threat 
is more serious this time. Besides, it is questionable whether 
a Western military intervention is effective at all now that the 
Serbs have practically won the war. 
  The United States' real dilemma now is which bad thing to 
choose. If it accepts the international recognition of most of 
the violent Serbian territorial gains, the moral and legal basis 
of the new world order will suffer an almost irremediable 
damage. In addition, this would lead to a long Muslim guerrilla 
war, which would reopen the conflicts in Croatia as well. If 
the United States wants to force the Serbs to come up with 
serious territorial compromises, then it must send troops to 
Bosnia and get involved in a serious war. It seems that the 
slogan in Washington today is "No solution is the best 
solution," and it continues to hope that the impoverished Serbia 
would be forced to retreat sooner or later. 
  In conclusion, we must return to a factor that also 
received some new color before and during Clinton's trip. The 
United States has always regarded the situation of national and 
ethnic minorities as a security factor in words. However, it 
drew the conclusion that the more quiet the minorities stay, the 
better. Washington never supported the demand for collective 
minority rights in any form, mainly territorial autonomy. Now 
Clinton repeatedly condemned the etnocentric nationalist state 
and national concept, as well as the disadvantageous 
discrimination on an ethnic basis, and he also stressed that 
guaranteeing the democratic rights of national, ethnic, and 
religious minorities is a global interest and, thus, it is also 
important for the United States. Vice President Gore and 
National Security Adviser Lake stressed for the first time that 
the oppression of national minorities causes nationalism and 
incites conflicts. Clinton concretely took a stand on behalf of 
the Russian minorities in the Baltic, and his staff signalled 
that the United States supports the idea that international 
institutions and agreements should also guarantee the minority 
rights. 
  In the first year of his presidency, Clinton concentrated on 
U.S. domestic policy, and this will hardly change in the future. 
However, the concrete balance of his European tour shows that 
our wider and narrower region, including Hungary, receives a 
place in shaping the new world order according to weight. It 
has become clear to a correct and open Hungarian foreign policy 
free of over or underestimation and a balanced foreign policy in 
its issues and style that it is worth continuing the Visegrad 
cooperation and the other subregional cooperation in the benefit 
of our Western integration, and we must seek an honorable 
rapprochement with our neighbors. The bad-taste rivalry, the 
old-style maneuvering between big powers, and all kinds of 
revanchism could only cause damage. On the other hand, a modern 
foreign policy that is clear and acceptable to the big powers 
and a foreign policy free of any exaggerated self-assertion can 
only strengthen us. One should not "sell" the particular 
Hungarian interests in any sense of the word; instead, we should 
harmonize them with the common interests or big powers. And 
there are more and better conditions for this now.

<F P=106> [Tibor Kis editorial: "Farewell to Visegrad"] </F>
  [Text] When Czech President Vaclav Havel said that the 
Visegrad cooperation had exhausted its possibilities, he was 
actually right. Perhaps not the way he thought. It can 
certainly be seen as a fact that last week's Prague summit was 
the final blow to the Visegrad Four, and it seems completely 
improbable that this forum of regional cooperation could be 
saved in its current form. Actually, there is not much reason to 
save it in its current form. All along, Visegrad remained a 
dream and it never became anything like it had been intended or 
what it could have been if Prague had also wanted it. However, 
this way, it did not turn into a regional power center or a 
framework of political and economic cooperation -- at the most, 
it was a political saloon, a discussion club, where the region's 
leaders passed some time together. This could not have had much 
practical use; it did not stop the economic links between the 
three -- later four -- Visegrad countries from breaking down, 
while the nations in question have not come closer together 
emotionally or politically, either. The main reason for this 
must be sought in the fact that, rather than seeing each other 
as partners, the governments of the given countries saw each 
other as rivals, or even as a burden hindering their march 
toward the West. 
  The only positive results of this cat-and-dog friendship 
arose almost completely independently of the participants, 
sometimes even against their wishes. They are very lucky that 
the West continues to treat the Visegrad countries as a group, 
and this has been to their definite advantage so far in their 
integration efforts. 
  The Prague summit brought important new elements into this 
situation. First of all, through offering the Partnership for 
Peace, Washington (although it still wants to see the four 
countries together) has resigned itself to the probable 
amplification of the rivalry and to an increased regional 
differentiation. Secondly, the Prague meeting also made it 
clear that the Czech Republic is canceling even the existing 
rudimentary forms of the Visegrad cooperation. The emerging new 
situation favors the strong, and according to all indications, 
Prague feels strong just now. 
  It would be pointless to dispute the Czech Republic's right 
to take a separate course from its neighbors, and to form its 
international relations independently of these countries, solely 
in accordance with its own interests. If Prague breaks with 
Visegrad -- so be it. However, the others should, by all means, 
realize that the Czech Republic is trying to do this in such a 
way that, without it, nothing should be left of Visegrad. 
Naturally, this intent is perfectly understandable from 
Prague's point of view -- a Visegrad without Czechs would be a 
serious counterbalance or alternative to Prague and the Czech 
way in Europe. 
  Up to now, in the Visegrad Four, everything has happened the 
way Prague wanted it; simply as a result of the decision-making 
mechanism based on consensus. Prague also shaped Visegrad's 
image to its current form -- namely to be without character. 
Now, for the first time, the time has come to say no to Prague. 
It is simply not true that, in the current situation, Central 
Europe does not have any other common issues but free trade, 
which is the only issue urged by [Czech Prime Minister] Klaus. 
  Naturally, for Central Europe to be able to represent its 
particular interests, a Visegrad group that no longer has the 
Czechs (and whose place the Slovenians, for example, would 
obviously be happy to take) should radically change its views. 
Much more imagination, goodwill, trust, and tolerance would be 
needed. All the factors that are missing in this region. 
  However, this situation might change slowly because the 
circumstances might compel the affected nations in this 
direction. So far, the main objection against closer Central 
European cooperation has been the argument that it would force 
the states that are trying to get access to the western 
integration to wait too long. In the meantime, however, the 
same situation has arisen even while regional cooperation was 
being disarrayed. By now, it has become clear that Central 
Europe will have to wait a long time for European Union 
membership and for NATO membership. However, we will still have 
to carry on living somehow until this happens. For this reason 
alone, Central Europe is doomed to cooperate; in fact, a more 
effective regional cooperation would actually strengthen the 
region's position in the process of negotiations with the West. 
  If Prague realizes this fact, it is good. If it does not 
then the others will still have to make a step. Even without 
Prague.

<F P=106> [Correspondent's report on interview with Tibor Fuzessy, </F>
minister without portfolio in charge of the National Security 
Office, at Ferihegy Airport on 19 January: "We Must Pay 
Attention to Every Extremism"] 
  [Text] We interviewed Tibor Fuzessy, minister without 
portfolio in charge of the National Security Office, about 
cooperation between the Hungarian and Italian intelligence 
services and the experiences of his recent visit to Rome, at 
Ferihegy Airport on 19 January. Fuzessy also spoke about 
intelligence activity regarding the extremist political 
groupings. 
  "The late Prime Minister Jozsef Antall's widow and two 
children flew to Rome for the holy mass in memory of her husband 
on the same airplane as I did. Many people asked whether there 
was any political connection here" -- Fuzessy told us. "This 
was only a coincidence, because we planned my trip to Rome well 
in advance; I paid an official visit, while the Antall family 
paid a personal visit to Rome." 
  Fuzessy told us that the cooperation between the two 
countries' intelligence services can now be openly called 
partnership relations. Control over the intelligence agencies 
was one of the major issues discussed at the meeting held at the 
partner organizations. 
  "The answer to this question is never easy and never free of 
debate" -- Fuzessy pointed out. In Italy, for example, a group 
of several ministers is in charge of the intelligence services. 
"We are trying to find a solution that provides the best 
guarantee that the intelligence services cannot act against the 
law. This is an important issue in Italy too, where the 
political restructuring also affects the activity of the 
intelligence services." 
  Fuzessy told us that antiterrorist actions and the struggle 
against organized crime, money laundering, and the smuggling of 
weapons and drugs were the main subjects discussed in the course 
of his talks with the heads of Western intelligence services. 
"We succeeded in getting the Hungarian intelligence 
organizations accepted as partners at the talks" -- Fuzessy 
added and said that this was one of the major achievements of 
recent years. 
  Organized crime is a relatively new development in the area 
of influence of the former Soviet Union and, naturally, in the 
former Yugoslavia. The Western intelligence organizations, 
including the Italian intelligence services, are very much 
interested in this development, and we succeeded in agreeing on 
the exchange of certain information, and we will receive 
information about the movement and actions of certain groups. 
  Then we asked Fuzessy for any information about extremist 
political groupings in Hungary, like the World National Popular 
Rule Party. 
  "Many parties often fear that the National Security Office 
keeps them under surveillance. This is not true. However, the 
National Security Office must keep an eye on everyone who has 
ideas or actions that could be anti-constitutional; namely those 
that aim at overthrowing the democratic state" -- Fuzessy 
pointed out. It is the obligation of the National Security 
Office to pay attention to every political extremism, no matter 
on what side. 
  Fuzessy told us that the activity of a party becomes a crime 
when the party is striving to take over power. A fascist-type 
takeover of power, or any organized activity with this aim would 
already qualify as a crime. However, as long as a party 
declares such an ideology but wants to achieve its goals through 
democratic means, it cannot be called to account. 
  However, other manifestations, like the use of forbidden 
symbols, already border on crime. Incitement also qualifies as 
a crime. This is an area "that the extremist parties can easily 
slip into" -- Fuzessy said in conclusion.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Neykov commentary: "So What"] </F>
  [Text] Two years have passed since we recognized the 
independence of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. 
Tracing the road toward its consolidation in the international 
arena, we assumed the risk of incurring the hostility of close 
and remote countries. So what? 
  Unfortunately, there was no turning point in relations 
between our two countries. The lies and insinuations that were 
insistently spread by Skopje and Belgrade in the past 50 years 
did not stop. The various obstacles and barbed wire still exist 
along the border. Our citizens continue to feel like "white 
crows" in Skopje, Bitola, and Ohrid. Almost nothing has been 
done to establish direct railroad communications or modernize 
the roads between the two countries. The possibilities of 
intensifying trade-economic cooperation and implementing 
initiatives related to scientific and cultural exchanges were 
not fully utilized, and God knows there are such possibilities. 
  It is true that joint efforts are needed to melt the ice 
that 
has accumulated in the last 50 years. It also is true that the 
authorities in Skopje are still loyal to the ideas of Titoism 
and fear everything Bulgarian, just like a vampire fears the 
daylight. One cannot expect from them any initiatives or total 
cooperation. However, what did our representatives do during 
those 730 days? Did they trace any new paths that could now be 
widened? They did nothing, or almost nothing at best. 
  Instead, we saw President Zhelev smiling with satisfaction 
when he was handed a translation of his "fascism" in some 
"language." We were puzzled when we saw how easily Prime 
Minister Berov swallowed his unease with the presence of a 
translator during his talks in Skopje. We also had to suffer 
the blunder with the commodity credit, which was promised 
ostensibly by [former Deputy Prime Minister] Neycho Neev. We 
blushed when President Kiro Gligorov confused us with his speech 
in the UN General Assembly, with not a single representative 
Bulgarian institution expressing its indignation. No one paid 
any attention to the report of the "Helsinki Watch" on the 
violations of the minorities' rights in Macedonia. That report 
mentioned the Albanian, Turkish, Gypsy, Serbian, Muslim, and 
many other minorities. Only the Bulgarians remained 
unmentioned. They simply do not exist, they disappeared. The 
Miladinov brothers, Dame Gruev, Gotse Delchev, and tens of 
thousands of revival figures would have blushed and burned with 
shame if they could assume that we will keep silent when it is 
broadly claimed that there are no Bulgarian elements in Vardar 
Macedonia. 
  It is high time to take a clear and categorical stand on 
those failures. Dirty hands or incompetent people could mar 
both the past and the present. What we probably need is a brief 
document of approximately 2,000 words, which, after holding a 
referendum and receiving the general support of the public, 
could once and for all clarify to the world our position on the 
Macedonian issue. 
  No one in our country lives in a dream world, nor is anyone 
striving to change political borders. We only want to protect 
our glorious past from someone's dirty hands.

<F P=106> [Konstantin Subchev commentary: "Calculated Chaos"] </F>
  [Text] The people of Stara Zagora woke up to find the town 
besmirched with fascist symbols and calls to settle accounts 
with ethnic minorities. These slogans are nothing new, but 
today they arouse particular alarm. 
  All the actions of the executive and legislative authorities 
make increasing numbers of people doubt whether the present 
political system is capable of dealing with the lawlessness, 
inflation, and unemployment. 
  Politicians and journalists have described this social chaos 
as "the Weimar syndrome." 
  The comparison with Germany in the 1920's is reinforced by 
the appearance of would-be fuhrers, each with his own program 
for solving every problem. 
  At the moment the greatest dreamer with hopes of becoming 
the 
savior of the nation is Father Gelemenov. The mass media have 
contributed to his popularity to no small extent, and this 
arouses certain suspicions. 
  With all his eccentricities, the good father is unable to 
gather enough supporters and funds to fulfill his threats. 
However, his statements, widely publicized in the newspapers, 
create a mood in society that may bring it to accept a really 
"strong hand," not only without resistance, but even with 
feelings of relief. There are enough examples of this in 
Bulgarian and world history. 
  Accordingly, in this case the militant priest is playing the 
role of a John the Baptist, who clears the way for the person 
who is to come and "baptize" the nation, and to baptize it "not 
only with the Holy Spirit, but also with fire," as the Gospels 
state. 
  As everyone knows, a flame does not only burn tinder, but 
consumes everything else as well.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Konstantin Subchev: "`Far From Splendid' </F>
Isolation"] 
  [Text] The concept of "Splendid Isolation," which exists 
in British history, refers to the time when the island always 
succeeded in staying out of Europe's military-political 
alliances and joining the victors at a convenient moment. 
  Over the last four years, the Movement for Rights and 
Freedoms [DPS] has successfully followed this tactic of 
maneuvering, avoiding every hazard in its way. Those hazards 
included the attacks of the nationalists, the Constitutional 
Court doubts, the suspicion of the parliamentary forces, and the 
mass media's critical attitude. Throughout that period, the DPS 
succeeded in fulfilling, to a large extent, its election 
promises without directly committing itself to the executive 
power. 
  The situation in the DPS now is far from rosy. Its 
commitment within the framework of the governmental mandate did 
not bring anything positive to its voters and evoked the 
inevitable struggle in the leadership, where mutual accusations 
of cooperating with the State Security and participating in the 
"revival process" were exchanged. 
  The meeting between Zhan Videnov and Filip Dimitrov created 
a 
sense of insecurity in the DPS on anything related to raising 
the electoral threshold, something that could leave the party 
outside the parliament. 
  Finally, the DPS also dissociated itself from President 
Zhelev. Otherwise, it would not have been so concerned with the 
creation of the notorious Military Office at the Presidency, and 
Ahmed Dogan would not have missed the opportunity to participate 
in the festive dinner in honor of Ms. Albright. 
  The DPS' isolation is increasing, and it could hardly be 
called a "Splendid Isolation."

<F P=106> [Article by Finance Minister Piro Dishnica: "The </F>
Introduction of Foreign Capital -- an Important Aspect of 
Reviving the Economy"] 
  [Text] For Albania and its totally centralized economy, 
the emergence from the autarkic system was accompanied by very 
severe economic upheavals and disruptions. The admission and 
recognition of the extremely complicated effects of the crisis 
that started in the middle of the 1970's, the efforts to ensure 
the survival of an additional 60,000 mouths to feed each year, 
and administrative efforts to implement "new economic 
mechanisms" further exacerbated economic difficulties and 
brought them to the surface. The wages paid under conditions of 
very low production levels and the granting of some limited 
freedoms to state enterprises increased imports and caused a 
significant increase in the budget deficit (15 percent of the 
gross domestic product in 1990 and 25 percent in 1991). 
Albania's involvement in currency transactions also led to the 
creation of a foreign debt of $500 million, adding to the 
country's isolation by cutting it off from the world's financial 
institutions. After 1991, all means of obtaining foreign credit 
were in practice closed. When the democratic government came to 
power in April 1992, it immediately undertook a comprehensive 
program guided by the policy of moving to a market economy. In 
implementing this program, the government used all its 
intellectual energies to stabilize all the necessary 
macroeconomic indicators with its privatization and its legal 
recognition of new allies in economic life: the struggle against 
inflation, the control of the budget deficit, and the 
establishment of a tax system based on the market economy. To 
enforce this program, considerable help was secured from abroad 
in many different ways, from the European Community and the 
"Stand-By" agreement with the IMF, whose success made possible 
in July 1993 the signing of an agreement in support of the 
medium-term economic reform program, as well as a World Bank 
loan. Besides this help, many other states also gave free help 
with food, development plans, and technical assistance. Italy, 
Greece, the United States, Germany, Turkey, and the other G-24 
countries carried the main burden of this. At first, the 
government concentrated on its policy of gradual macroeconomic 
stabilization and of establishing control of the main financial 
indicators as the sole way of promoting economic growth. Now 
that the main part of the program has been implemented, visible 
progress is evident in reaching its principal objectives. The 
severe fall in production has been halted, mainly reflecting the 
significant response of agriculture to price reforms and 
privatization. Spiraling inflation has been reversed and the 
government's budget deficit has been significantly reduced from 
40 percent of the gross domestic product at the start of the 
economic stabilization program to less than 10 percent in the 
first half of 1993. This is the result of the enforcement of 
strict discipline in expenditure, which shows that the process 
of reducing the budget deficit is continuing, despite constant 
demands for expenditure and to create and sustain a social 
welfare network for those most affected by the transition 
period. In greater detail, expenditure has been made in several 
main directions: 
  1. The application of a social policy through an 
institutional network and a range of economic and social 
mechanisms, such as unemployment benefit, widening the basis of 
welfare assistance, and increasing pay and pensions in education 
and health. 
  2. Increasing budget expenditure for investments, including 
a fund of 4 billion leks for the restructuring and support of 
enterprises. 
  3. Price subsidies for a range of staple goods of household 
consumption. 
  At the same time, monetary policy has been conducted in 
accordance with the objectives of the general anti-inflation 
program, the balance of payments, and development. The level of 
inflation is now considered to be within the limits of the 
program. From March this year, it has fluctuated around an 
average of 0.5 percent a month, with the exception of July, when 
an increase arose from the change in bread and flour prices, and 
September when there was a relative rise because of the 
administrative increase of some controlled prices. The rate of 
money circulation rose from 1.7 in 1992 to 2.1 in 1993. The 
reestablishment of control over the principal financial 
indicators led to the stabilization of the lek, which, after its 
fall in 1992 to 130 leks to the dollar, rose gradually to 85 
leks to the dollar in August 1992. Since then, the lek has 
declined gradually and is now stabilized at 99 leks to one U.S. 
dollar. 
  The private sector's share of bank credit has grown from 12 
percent in December 1992 to 30 percent. Nevertheless, this is a 
relatively small proportion because of the institutional 
shortcomings of the banks and the private sector credit network. 
  Significant advances have been made in the enforcement of 
pricing policy and the reduction of budget subsidies. Wholesale 
and retail prices have in general been freed. Nevertheless, 
control is being maintained over 25 items, such as wheat, bread, 
and certain non food-items, such as water, electricity, bus 
transportation, and schoolbooks. Although the prices for these 
latter items have risen several times, they still do not cover 
costs. The policy of price rises aims to remove the obstacles 
to increasing the production of goods that are currently 
imported. A visible result of this policy has been the 
reduction of price subsidies from 3.3 percent of the gross 
domestic product in 1993 to 2.2 percent in 1992. 
  In agriculture, the government's attention has concentrated 
on privatizating and restructuring the state farms, completing 
the reform of the prices of agricultural products, repairing the 
rural infrastructure, and privatizating the distribution and 
processing enterprises. The World Rank and other donors have 
closely collaborated in this reform. The priorities have been 
to privatize and restructure the state farms and to increase the 
prices of agricultural inputs approximately to the level of the 
equivalent imports. I wish to emphasize here that the measures 
to transform the Agricultural Development Bank into a new kind 
of body entirely subject to the Bank Law are of particular 
importance for the role this bank will play in supporting the 
restructuring of agriculture. 
  Many enterprises remain in a difficult situation in an 
industry dominated by state enterprises. Many of them are 
closed or operating at below full productive capacity, incurring 
major losses in almost all sectors. Lack of financial 
discipline, failure to adapt to the market economy, and budget 
restrictions led to an accumulation of debts between 
enterprises. The life expectancy of several large sectors of 
Albanian industry is uncertain without deep and painful 
restructuring and an influx of foreign investment. For this 
reason, the government created the Enterprise Restructuring 
Agency, which has direct responsibility for about 30 key 
enterprises that present the most serious problems, and of whom 
the majority are loss-making. The goal of this agency is to 
restructure these enterprises, enabling decisions to be made 
concerning their future within one or two years, with the aim of 
turning them into effective enterprises, later privatizing them, 
liquidating them, or selling their assets. 
  Within financial constraints, the government's program 
supports the infrastructure, on the basis of a general 
assessment that the larger part of Albania's public 
infrastructure will not suffice to develop a modern economy or 
encourage investments in various branches of the economy. 
Although the transportation system has been judged to be 
adequately extensive, it falls far short of the necessary 
quality standards and has deteriorated to a degree that it 
hampers economic development. One of the government's 
priorities is to repair the main roads and to extend roads in 
mountainous areas. One positive indication of the fast 
development of the transportation sector is the private sector's 
domination of inter- urban and international passenger and 
freight traffic. 
  Albania's telecommunication infrastructure is extremely 
limited. As part of a master plan, it is forecast that a 
$30-million program financed by the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development, ltaly, Switzerland, and Austria 
will be carried out, making it possible to restructure this 
sector. It is planned to obtain resources to quickly introduce 
modern telecommunications systems as a necessary precondition 
for attracting investors and tourists. 
  There have been significant improvements in construction, 
both in the towns and the countryside, mainly carried out by 
private investors. In order to cover the shortage of housing 
and to improve the existing housing stock, the government has 
aimed to increase the role of the private sector and to reduce 
costs. The law as approved has been implemented, leading to the 
fast privatization of the housing stock. In order to encourage 
private housing construction, the rents of recently constructed 
dwellings have been deregulated. Work has resumed to complete 
half-finished apartments, and 1,452 of these apartments have 
been completed and handed over. During this period, investments 
to the tune of 713 million leks have been made. Private 
investors have constructed 8,401 dwellings amd 24,090 business 
premises in the countryside, and many others are under way. 
  The privatization program has aimed to encourage private 
initiative in two main directions: the creation of private 
enterprise in all sectors of the economy, without restriction, 
and the privatization of state property. 
  In the second field, besides the priority privatization of 
the retail sector enterprises, handicrafts, road transportation, 
construction, the food industry, and light industry, it was 
planned that enterprises and plants in the industrial sector 
(mainiy small- scale enterprises and production lines) would 
also be privatized by the end of 1993. In the course of this 
program, 25,432 privatization deals have now been concluded, 
covering 9,000 retail stores, 4,500 service premises, 4,000 
deals in transportation, 5,000 in agriculture, and 2,800 in 
other sectors. More than 100,000 people are now employed in the 
private sector. 
  The Privatization Law has been revised to accelerate the 
process of privatization within the strategic framework. The 
authorities directly involved in privatization have been 
reorganized, and an incentive fiscal policy has been adopted. 
The laws on the bankruptcy of enterprises and on the 
restitution and compensation of property are expected to exert a 
positive influence in this direction. Despite the objective 
difficulties that are emerging, every effort is being made to 
implement the compensation policy through compulsory orders and 
to create opportunities for those benefiting to take part in the 
privatization process. 
  Suitable legislation for a market economy is being passed 
quickly. Parliament has approved a law on retail firms, a law 
on the Albanian bank, a bankruptcy law, an accountancy law, 
labor legislation, and a very liberal foreign investment law 
that facilitates the registration procedure and, most 
importantly, consistently refers disputes to international law. 
The tax and customs laws have been entirely reformulated in 
accordance with the principles of the market economy. The 
increase of investments through the introduction of foreign 
capital is one of the most important paths toward economic 
revival. Despite the problems that have arisen, interest among 
foreign firms and investors to come to Albania is visibly 
growing. Estimates show that firms with an initial capital of 
$50 million, and contracted capital of $100 million, have signed 
contracts and begun work. Different firms making a total 
investment of $70 million are also expected to begin work on the 
basis of contracts that have been concluded. 
  The government is making increasing efforts to create an 
attractive climate for foreign investors. Foreign investors are 
not subject to capital controls and are free to transfer their 
profits. Tax-free status for four years is also offered to all 
investors in the productive sector, with extensions of this 
period for firms that reinvest and those who invest in tourism. 
Moreover, investors will benefit from liberal customs 
concessions for those articles that will be used for investment 
purposes. Foreigners may now lease land for 99 years at a very 
favorable rate and may also buy this land for certain projects. 
The imminent approval of the civil code will permit private 
land ownership and the rights stemming from this ownership will 
give fresh encouragement for foreign investors to come to 
Albania.

<F P=106> [Report by Martin Leka on a Democratic Alliance news </F>
conference held in Tirana on 17 January: "Albania Cannot Become 
Palermo"] 
  [Text] At 1300 on 17 January the Democratic Alliance [AD] 
held a news conference in one of the halls of the Palace of 
Congresses. Blendi Fevziu opened the news conference and read a 
press communique from the party presidency. 
  The communique stated that the murder of Gjovalin Cekini on 
14 January marked the tragic culmination of the state's campaign 
to obstruct by any means the party's political activity. 
Gjovalin Cekini was a participant in the first anticommunist 
demonstrations in Albania. 
  The murder of this AD activist was political, the communique 
continued, describing the murder and citing evidence relating to 
it. 
  One of the culprits in the murder, Selami Cela, emerged from 
a Mercedes without license plates a few minutes before the end 
of the Shkoder meeting and spoke to a person who was in the car 
of Ali Kazazi, the Shkoder Democratic Party [PD] chairman. 
  A second person involved in the murder was one of the many 
PD 
provocateurs in the hall where the AD's meeting took place. 
Gjovalin Cekini was one of the leading activists of the AD 
during the meeting, helping to defuse the tensions caused by the 
PD provocateurs. Selami Cela was foremost among the 
provocateurs facing the people who emerged from the meeting and 
shouted "Long live Sali Berisha: There is only the PD in 
Shkoder." 
  Gjovalin Cekini and his brother Pal tried to prevent Selami 
Cela from using his weapon. 
  The communique went on to state that this murder marked an 
extreme escalation of the war on the AD and was motivated by the 
fact that some state officials and members of the ruling party 
have embarked on the road of crime to fulfill and protect their 
political and economic interests. For this purpose, they are 
organizing themselves with the help of Mafia-style structures 
and activities involving high level officials of the Albanian 
state, members of the National Intelligence Service, local 
government officials, professional criminals, traffickers in oil 
and weapons, violators of the UN embargo against the former 
Yugoslavia, and members of the Privatization Board or those who 
have profited or expect to profit illegally from the board. All 
these control and have taken hostage Shkoder's political and 
economic life, joined in a criminal association. 
  As for the statement of the Ministry of Public Order 
broadcast on Albanian Television yesterday, the communique 
declared that this statement associated itself with the crime 
and made political judgments that are in flagrant contravention 
of the status of a depoliticized television station. This 
statement differed from that issued earlier by stressing the 
word "citizen" instead of the word "murderer" used before. 
  The communique called on the PD, the government, and the 
president to identify and condemn the culprits fairly and fast, 
and to identify, isolate, and condemn the mafia-style criminal 
elements, so that crime and violence may not become a 
characteristic of the first opposition party in Albania, which 
rose up against crime and violence. 
  In conclusion, the communique stated that the AD appeals to 
the governments of European countries and the United States, the 
Council of Europe, the CSCE, and the Helsinki Community, asking 
them to use their authority to intervene to ensure that the 
tragic murder in Shkoder should not become a precedent for a 
state of violence and terror. 
  Messrs. Neritan Ceka and Arben Imami then replied to the 
questions of the journalists present. 
  The questions mainly concerned the recent incident in 
Shkoder, but there were also others off the subject, to which 
the speakers did not reply. 
  Asked by KOHA JONE about the recent incident's similarity 
to the events of 2 April [1991] in Shkoder, Neritan Ceka replied 
that these two events bore a similarity. This shows the 
similarity between the regimes, he said, evident in the 
statement of the Public Order Ministry and its collaboration 
with the procurator. He went on to say that there are further 
similarities, because both events made use of armed irregulars 
[bashibozuko] because the politicians threw stones and then 
covered their tracks, and because the Public Order Ministry 
officials and those of the Procurator's Office have learned 
nothing from the fate of their colleagues of 2 April. There are 
similarities, because both events have their origins in hatred, 
with the difference that in the first case this hatred was 
ideological and in the second economic. Both cases involve a 
collaboration between the politics and crime. Only a 
dictatorship can be built on the basis of a mafia and of crime. 
If the Albanians live with this kind of collaboration for two 
years, there will then be no elections. 
  One question was what will the AD's strategy be if the 
Public 
Order Ministry persists in the same standpoint. Ceka replied 
that we only have one strategy, which is democracy. 
  Answering a question from RlLlNDJA DEMOKRATlKE's journalist, 
who said that this event could not favor the PD, Mr. Imami 
replied that he was not sure to whose favor it went, but it is 
the third occasion in Shkoder on which there has been an attempt 
to sow terror. The first was the incident with the Socialists; 
the second involved Azem Hajdari and the New Political 
Initiative, and the third was this case involving ourselves, 
which ended with a tragic murder. He stressed that it was the 
same group attempting to sow terror. In every district, we have 
encountered PD members who have turned on us with such methods. 
Imami went on to mention an incident in Durres, in which a 
person's two trucks had been held by the customs, and the PD's 
people had asked this person to go to the AD's meeting and shout 
against the AD, so that his trucks would be released. You, Mr. 
Paloka, Imami continued, contributed your piece in yesterday's 
article in which you said that one of the murderers was in the 
meeting hall. I can add that they later met together in the 
cafe of the main hotel. Asked if the incident was connected 
with the embargo, Imami said that the AD was not the first to 
denounce the embargo, and we are not talking about 30-40 liters, 
about about a pipe linking the two banks of the Buna and a truck 
with a big "Marshallah" plate that plies round Shkoder. We 
accuse people who are vested with power, perhaps with 
connections to the very summit of power, of breaking the embargo. 
  In connection with the pro-Serb declaration cited by the 
Public Order Ministry statement, Imami stated that this was an 
utter lie. The AD went to Shkoder to start the political new 
year on 14 January, the anniversary of the first anticommunist 
demonstration in Albania, a large number of whose participants 
are now AD members. Gjovalin Cekini was one of the participants 
in this demonstration, and one of the missionaries of the 
Catholic church and of religious belief. We went to Shkoder in 
order to put forward our ideas and our program. We were asked, 
"Why did you go to Belgrade?" We explained our platform and 
standpoint on this matter, our standpoint on Kosova, etc. As 
for the statement that we have neither killed Serbs, nor have 
they killed us, this is simply a lie perpetrated by the police 
authorities. Imami underlined that RILINDJA of 16 January on 
page 11 states that the AD is putting its political views on the 
market, and he continued, "The fact is that the Serbs and the 
Albanians have killed and murdered each other, but have not 
wiped each other out; thus it is normal to start a dialogue." 
In other words, our statement in Shkoder was quite the opposite 
to what was alleged by RILINDJA DEMOKRATlKE and the Public Order 
Ministry statement. I also possess a recorded cassette of this, 
Imami concluded in reply to this question. 
  Neritan Ceka, asked if the AD discerned anybody responsible 
for this incident, replied that this question should be put to 
Sali Berisha, president of the Republic, who had warned the 
socialists in connection with the earlier incident in Shkoder 
with the words "What did the Socialists want in Shkoder?" The 
president would have done well to have asked "What do the 
Motionists [mocioniste, parliamentary group that founded the AD] 
want in Shkoder?" before this putsch in Shkoder was organized. 
  Among the many replies given by Messrs. Ceka and Imami, we 
would single out the answer concerning the meeting of the AD 
deputies with the general director of the republic's police and 
the leading police officers of Shkoder, who told the deputies 
that they were "concerned about extinguishing religious conflict 
in Shkoder," a strange statement to emerge from a news 
conference given by AD leaders. The AD leaders said that the 
motive behind the Public Order Ministry's statements was to 
confuse the public. We would also single out Imami's statement 
that he had told the spokesman of this ministry to look for and 
find former Sigurimi collaborators from the head of state 
downwards. 
  In connection with the AD's demands for cooperation with the 
PD, Ceka said among other things: Return the money of Arsidi 
and Zhulali to the Albanian State Bank; denounce the Islamic 
pact and Albania's adherence to it; and seriously fight against 
corruption and political crime. 
  In reply to a somewhat obscure question from an ATA 
journalist, Ceka replied, "We are merely pleased that ATA takes 
an interest in the AD. So much nonsense is talked about it...." 
  In conclusion, the chairman of the news conference gave the 
floor to Neritan Ceka, who said, "I will tell you something. 
The AD is not made up of men who are frightened." Let me say, 
and let people realize clearly, that "Albania cannot become 
Palermo, and there is no turning back." That is all I have to 
say. 
  We emphasize that the news conference aroused great interest 
and passed without incident, in order to scotch rumors 
circulating yesterday about alleged incidents during the news 
conference. At the news conference, an AD member, a participant 
in the Shkoder meeting and one of the organizers of the first 
anticommunist demonstration, published in the conference hall 
the names of Gjovalin Cekini's murderers, including that of 
Selami Cela, who has often been mentioned recently in Shkoder, 
as well as in Public Order Ministry statements.

Sad, has said that postmen could not distribute pensions to more 
than 15,000 pensioners today because the Financial Transaction 
Service has not yet sent out the new dinars. The service should 
have sent out 585,000 new dinars today and tomorrow. 
Consequently, Paroski says, the post office will only start 
delivering pensions tomorrow. [passage omitted] 
  The new dinars have not yet appeared in the busiest post 
office in Belgrade either, and the payment of pensions has been 
postponed until further notice, a TANJUG reporter was told today 
by Milan Radulovic, the manager of the Belgrade-3 post office. 
According to him, transactions in old dinars function as 
normal. [passage omitted] 
  The initial implementation of the federal government's new 
measures failed to meet the expectations in eastern Serbia too. 
This is the inevitable conclusion resulting from reports from 
commercial banks in Zajecar, Bor, Pozarevac, and Smederevo, 
which stress that this morning they could not pay part of 
January pensions due to a shortage of cash. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Belgrade, Jan 24 (TANJUG) -- Neither of the 
candidates nominated for the post of president of the parliament 
of the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia was returned late on Monday 
evening [24 January]. The candidate of the Socialist Party, 
Zoran Arandjelovic, secured 123 votes, two short of the 
necessary majority. The candidate nominated jointly by the 
opposition, Gvozden Rosic, was supported by 118 deputies. The 
vote was taken by 249 deputies to the 250-seat parliament. The 
procedure will be repeated on Tuesday.

  [Text] The Serbian Assembly will resume its discussion on 
the nomination of candidates for chairman of the assembly in 
half an hour. During the recess this morning, 119 deputies of 
the Socialist Party of Serbia again proposed Zoran Arandjelovic 
as chairman of the republican parliament, while 30 Depos 
[Democratic Movement of Serbia] deputies again proposed Gvozden 
Rosic. Some deputies have expressed the view that this is a 
stalemate situation. There is a possibility of neither of the 
two candidates being elected, as was the case last night. The 
Serbian Assembly is currently in recess. The session is 
scheduled to resume at 1430.

  [Text] Skopje, 24 Jan (TANJUG) -- At its session today the 
government of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia passed a 
law on denationalization, which is applicable to all property 
seized by the state without compensation between 2 August 1944 
and 15 February 1968, it was announced in Skopje this evening. 
Implementation of the law will mean the return of property to 
the previous owners, which will take a long time, the Macedonian 
Government says. Among those dispossessed of their property are 
large numbers of the Serbian nationality, who were expelled from 
Macedonia in 1941 by the Bulgarian aggressor, and Josip Broz's 
[Tito's] regime banned their return to their homes. Most of the 
owners and their heirs are now citizens of the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia, and a number of them also live abroad.

  [Text] Since two days ago, there are two parallel 
leaderships of the Tetovo branch of the PDP [Party for 
Democratic Prosperity]. The first is led by Menduh Taci and the 
second is connected with the legal committee for the preparation 
of the congress of the party. The dilemma arises as to which 
leadership will be legal and present the body of the congress. 
It is interesting to note that the assembly under the 
leadership of Taci was attended by the representative of the 
Democratic Party of Albania, Saban Memia. Otherwise, 
representatives of both factions of the PDP stayed in Tirana, 
last week, on a "reconciliation" visit. However, the outcome in 
Tetovo, this weekend, shows that the "axe was not buried."

<F P=106> [Report by Petko Koprivica from Krajina] </F>
  [Excerpt] The final outcome of the second round of 
presidential elections in the republic of Serbian Krajina is not 
known yet. However, all results so far indicate that 
independent candidate Milan Martic will assume the post of the 
head of this most westerly Serbian state. According to 
unofficial results, Milan Martic won 77,400 votes in 20 out of 
the total of 28 constituencies. The other presidential 
candidate, Milan Babic, received 72,130 votes. The Republican 
Electoral Commission holds the view that Martic's victory is a 
foregone conclusion. Here is what Marijana Puhaca, secretary of 
the aforementioned commission, said about the elections: 
  [Begin Puhaca recording] By 1400 today, the Republican 
Electoral Commission received unofficial results for 19 out of 
the total of 28 constituencies. These 19 constituencies have 
199,274 registered voters. Of these, 140,334 or 58 percent have 
cast their vote. In these 19 constituencies, Milan Babic won 
68,495 votes, and Milan Martic 71,527 votes. 
  By 1400 today, the Republican Electoral Commission received 
official results for only four communes, Drnis, Krnjak, Obrovac, 
and Plaski. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Miladin Manojlovic] </F>
  [Text] According to unofficial results of yesterday's 
elections, Milan Martic has convincingly won the second round of 
elections for president of the republic of Serbian Krajina in 
Slavonia, Baranja, and Western Srem. Miladin Manojlovic reports 
from Beli Manastir: 
  [Manojlovic] In Slavonia, Baranja, and Western Srem, Milan 
Martic won 7,070 votes more than Milan Babic. The Vukovar 
electoral unit voters, as in the first round of voting, 
supported Milan Martic the most. He received 15,715 votes and 
Milan Babic received 9,903 votes. Martic won with almost 6,000 
votes more. 
  In other electoral units, the differences are not so great, 
only a few hundred votes more in favor of Martic, except in 
Dalj, where Milan Babic won. Milan Martic won in Beli Manastir, 
Mirkovci, and Tenja. Martic won 651 votes more in Beli 
Manastir, 271 votes more in Mirkovci, and 403 votes more in 
Tenja. Milan Babic won 66 votes more in Dalj. 
  The elections in this region went without any objections 
being raised. The results were verified by observers for both 
presidential candidates. A turnout of over 60 percent, despite 
bad weather, can be considered high and seen as an expression of 
the citizens' will, who confirmed once again the existence and 
resoluteness of the republic of Serbian Krajina.

  [Text] Customs officers in the port of Split have prevented 
the illegal import of military equipment into the territory of 
the Republic of Croatia. The British warship Sir Geraint, 
anchored in the Split port on 21 January, and completed customs 
procedures in possession of valid documents. However, during 
the regular customs inspection, the customs officers discovered 
an irregularity -- namely, one of the eight registered 
containers, declared as dangerous cargo, contained, instead of 
registered gas and petrol, a large amount of ammunition of 
various calibres, military equipment, hand grenades, and 43 
boxes with 14 kg of explosives each. 
  As is the regular procedure according to Croatian 
regulations, which are in line with international laws, a 
commission will be formed to estimate the value of the illegal 
cargo. Criminal charges will be brought against the ship 
commander, while the illegally imported container, already been 
stored in the customs warehouse in Split, will be confiscated.

  [Text] Belgrade, Jan 24 (TANJUG) -- The foreign minister of 
the republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.) Slobodan Jarcevic Monday 
[24 January] warned the U.N. Security Council that Croatia 
wishes to occupy the R.S.K. by military aggression and that it 
is striving to get the approval of the international communty to 
this end. 
  Jarcevic said that the R.S.K., republic proclaimed in 1991 
by 
the Serbs in the territory of the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Croatia where they are in majority, will defend its independence 
with determination. He underlined that the U.N. must help the 
just struggle of the R.S.K. and the right of its people to 
self-determination, guaranteed by the U.N. Charter. 
  Already in 1990, through terror and ethnic cleansing, 
Croatia 
caused the creation of two purely national states in the 
territory of the former Croatia : the Republic of Croatia and 
the R.S.K., Jarcevic said in a letter to the U.N. Security 
Council chairman. Jarcevic was reacting to a letter addressed 
on January 22 to the Security Council by Croatian Foreign 
Minister Mate Granic, demanding that the international community 
help Croatia annex R.S.K. territory. 
  Croatia believes that the joint declaration of the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.) and Croatia on the normalization 
of their relations gives it the green light to occupy the 
R.S.K., he said. Croatian President Tudjman Saturday warned 
that Croatia would recover the R.S.K. territory by other means 
if not through an agreement. The F.R.Y. has signed the 
declaration in order to normalize relations with the Republic of 
Croatia, and not to help Croatia annex the R.S.K. as the 
Croatian minister claimed in his letter, Jarcevic noted. 
  F.R.Y. and Croatian representatives signed on January 19 in 
Geneva a joint declaration on the normalization of their 
relations. Since the former Yugoslav Federation disintegrated, 
the two states have had no economic or political relations.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus: </F>
"Revolutionary Dogmatism and the Nontriviality of Practical 
Politics"] 
  [Text] Recently some members of the cabinet and I myself 
have been reproached for assuaging our rhetoric and even a 
certain withdrawal from our originally defined positions. I 
have the feeling that the people who argue this way base their 
criticism on a misunderstanding of the first post-November 
period and a somewhat superficial observation of the present 
stage of the historical regeneration of our country, and since 
this is a serious matter, it merits a few words of explanation. 
  If we take as the first example the economic basis of our 
transformation program, the intensity with which I fought in the 
spring of 1990 for the price liberalization, balanced budget, 
macroeconomic stability, and particularly privatization is being 
compared with my present alleged leniency in the matter of the 
rent and transport tariffs regulation, in the disputes over 
supplementing the state budget from the National Property Fund 
or the postponement of the beginning of the second wave of 
coupon privatization. These critics here note a contradiction 
that is beyond my comprehension. 
  My original fight for freedom of enterprise and the 
abolition 
of all forms of state interventionism is being compared with my 
present endeavors to regulate the super-fast development in 
wages. Another sin! 
  Today, the fundamentally negative stand I assumed against 
the 
gradualist project of the economic reform (represented 
particularly by V. Komarek, M. Zeman, and F. Vlasak) is 
contrasted with my own gradualism in the matters of the state 
administration reform, for instance, or the education reform. 
Again, an alleged inconsistency! 
  While in the past I have been often described as the chief 
engineer of the "shock therapy," a Friedmanite, and an 
ultra-right character, I am being attacked today, from the side 
of the so-called authentic right wing, for my -- according to 
them -- unwarranted social regards and hesitance in adopting 
more severe and risky economic and social solutions. Almost a 
state paternalism! 
  My merciless criticism of the so-called third way is 
presently being compared with my endeavors to explain to the 
Western governments where their real mistake lies. My 
consistently negative stand towards the communist past is being 
contrasted with my willingness to cooperate with the widest 
possible circle of able people who are ready to act. My calls 
for freedom of the press and speech are being contrasted with my 
alleged efforts to place the radio and television under the 
direct control of the government. I could go on like this for 
quite a while longer. 
  First of all, I must point out that I listen to these 
criticisms very carefully, and that from each of them I am 
trying to reach some conclusions for myself. Nevertheless, I 
believe that they are based on false assumptions, which are the 
idea of the inconsistency of my present and former views, on the 
one hand, and the idea of the equivalence of the tasks of 
January 1990 and those of January 1994, on the other hand! 
  The ensuing misunderstanding (I cannot rid myself of this so 
frequently reminded and caricatured word of mine) troubles me 
nonetheless, and therefore I keep trying to explain the reasons 
for it in the press, at political talks, or at meetings with 
citizens. Even in this brief text, I would like to make at least 
two general comments on this. 
  The first problem that causes complications is the 
communication between a politician and the public by means of 
the deceptive transmission mechanism of media. Politics is -- 
among other things -- the art of the correct usage of the words, 
which are ordinarily at the politician's disposal only in the 
degenerate form of slogans, signs, certain cliches, and 
especially dangerous simplifications. A politician 
unfortunately does not have the opportunity to express his ideas 
and views in extensive essays or even novels, or rather, if he 
does, he does not do so as a politician. The situation forces 
him to express himself in a condensed manner, therefore 
necessarily imprecisely, and -- let us not be afraid to admit it 
-- often dogmatically and schematically. I will give a small 
example. If the Czech, or more correctly "Prague" economic 
school (which is a daring exaggeration) had at least a small 
comparative advantage in anything at all in the present economy, 
it would be, for instance, in its understanding that the term 
"central planning" represents only a hypothetic model concept, 
and that nothing like that has actually existed in the real 
socialism of the past decades. Although -- as opposed to 
standard economics -- I am well aware of this, in the every-day 
political abbreviation, I defend the free market against central 
planning because I cannot do anything else. (Nevertheless, it 
could have been noticed that I avoid the cheap condemnation of 
various institutions and mechanisms of the past, and instead 
always try for a positive program). 
  I would like to emphasize that I feel awkward using such 
and similar thought abridgements and slogans and, in particular, 
I am concerned that I could discombobulate someone and elicit 
false expectations of a similar brevity of the practical 
solutions. I am afraid that some of our somewhat tardy 
revolutionaries of the turn of the years 1993/1994 would, still 
today, like to see changes that would be just as fast in actual 
life as they are in the words used. Some of these people 
perceive our temporarily lower rate of unemployment as a 
betrayal of the ideas of Milton Friedman, others compare the 
present "oppression" of businessmen with the period of the 
government of Klement Gottwald, yet others interpret the search 
for a complex transformation of the budget-funded and subsidized 
organizations into non-profit organizations and the optimum 
relations between sponsors and the tax system as a denial of the 
foundations of the civic society and Michael Novak's concept of 
"mediating structures." Of course, this is completely false, 
but all that remains is to be careful with the condensed 
slogans, and keep explaining patiently what is concealed behind 
them. 
  The other important element is that our society and the 
economy -- without us realizing this sufficiently well because 
of the tremendous speed of the changes -- are no longer 
reminiscent of almost anything of the political and economic 
structures of the period immediately after the November. The 
problems that we are dealing with today are miles from the 
problems of spring 1990, i.e. from the period immediately after 
the fall of communism. 
  Some of us insist on underestimating this factor. They 
forget the difference between demolishing and building, the 
difference between the spectacular pivotal measures (there are 
several of them) and the assiduous every-day work, and the 
disparity of the fast system-forming steps and the slow 
post-transformation tasks, they forget the one-dimensional 
character of the political, social, and economic reality then, 
and the vigor and wealth of life today, they forget the greater 
possibilities for adopting rapid measures then, and the complex 
system of our political life now. Moreover, our oversensitivity 
to the excesses of the past very logically puts our government 
in a much weaker position than that of an ordinary Western 
European government. All this fundamentally affects, and to a 
great degree complicates, our life today, but we have to take it 
as a given circumstance. This also applies to our critics. 
  It is my deepest conviction that the practical politics of 
the present are completely consistent with the stands we have 
proclaimed incessantly since November 1989. The dissatisfaction 
and impatience of some of us is not a result of the errors of 
the present, but rather stem from a misunderstanding of the 
essence of the present system and, for that matter, also of the 
past one.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec by Martin </F>
Danes; place and date not given: "We Will Be a Member of NATO in 
a Few Years"] 
  [Text] In the wake of President Clinton's visit to Prague, 
we interviewed Foreign Minister Zieleniec on the Partnership for 
Peace and the Czech Republic's future security situation. 
  [Danes] What is your assessment, a week later, of the visit 
to Prague by the U.S. President and of the Partnership for Peace 
plan? 
  [Zieleniec] I think that President Clinton's visit was 
important not only for us and for designing the new security 
architecture in Europe but, from a certain point of view, also 
for the United States. The very fact that the visit took place 
and that President Clinton chose Prague as one of the places to 
hold talks during his first visit to Europe was also significant 
for us. This is recognition of what we are doing, recognition of 
the success of our reforms, and is a manifestation of the 
friendly relations between the United States and our country. 
  In my opinion, this visit was also important for the United 
States. U.S. foreign policy has been seeking a specific form 
ever since President Clinton came into office. It has often had 
to endure harsh accusations from European politicians and media 
that the country is again seeking isolation, that it is becoming 
wrapped up in itself, or that it is reorienting itself toward 
Asia. At the same time, it is obvious that, from the security 
point of view, Europe was, is, and will be for a long time a key 
continent. Clinton's European visit, the way it was planned, and 
its results prove that Europe remains a central feature of U.S. 
security policy. 
  The visit was also important for us because it acted as a 
major stimulus in the debate on expanding the Western security 
system. It demonstrated that the anxiety about the West's 
reluctance and inability to gradually fill the security vacuum 
in Central Europe was unfounded. The Partnership for Peace plan 
originally offered, in principle, only joint exercises and the 
possibility of other military activities with NATO. What the 
NATO summit in Brussels finally approved and President Clinton 
outlined in Prague is much more. The plan now contains a serious 
offer of political cooperation. 
  [Danes] What does this offer of political cooperation 
consist 
of? 
  [Zieleniec] The approved document contains a relatively 
detailed definition of the political values on which Partnership 
for Peace is based. This is important because the North Atlantic 
Alliance defends the West European, if you like, Western 
Christian, system of values--freedom, democracy... So as not to 
use any high-flown words, it defends our way of life. This 
specification is also the basis for future differentiation 
between the individual partner states. If the Partnership for 
Peace is established explicitly on this value basis, a basis 
that also serves as a criterion for the success of the bilateral 
agreements, I have no doubt that it will lead to our country's 
membership in the Alliance. Since the beginning, Czech diplomacy 
has been striving actively to ensure that, for these practical 
reasons, the plan attained a substantial political dimension. 
The fact that this has happened is undoubtedly a result of this 
endeavor. 
  Moreover, during his visit to Prague, President Clinton put 
forward other specific projects in support of the new European 
democracies, projects that should intensify the ties between our 
republic, the other Central European countries, and NATO 
countries. It is apparent from all of this that the Partnership 
offer is not a decoy or a blind alley but is a real step 
forward--a step that, at the same time, also relates to Russia 
and presents alternatives in the event of unfavorable security 
developments in our region. 
  [Danes] Did you get, for instance, an indirect promise from 
the U.S. President of involvement in our security, and were 
specific dates mentioned in this regard? 
  [Zieleniec] No promise of specific involvement was made, and 
no dates were mentioned, but I do not think this is what is 
important here. The visit by the U.S. President and the talks as 
a whole mean that they are taking us into consideration. 
Moreover, President Clinton said very decidedly that the 
security of the Czech Republic is important for the security of 
the United States. 
  I would also like to refer to the reverse aspect of this 
issue, an aspect that is often overlooked. If we feel like a 
future NATO member--and I believe justifiably so--we should 
think about it within the scope of its future efficiency. That 
is, one day the Alliance will also guarantee our state's 
security. I admit, therefore, that, in reply to a question of 
whether NATO should be opened up immediately to all the 
countries of East Europe, I personally do not come up with the 
answer as easily as some Czech journalists. Perhaps it would be 
worth thinking about this, about whether it would be better to 
wait a while--as far as our entry into NATO is concerned, of 
course--with the aim of maintaining the Western alliance's 
efficiency. The immediate incorporation of inconstant Eastern 
states, many of which do not yet have a deep-rooted system of 
Western values and are economically and politically unstable, 
into the Alliance could seriously impair its defensive strength. 
No such considerations are ever published in the Czech press. 
  [Danes] How distant does the prospect of signing a 
bilateral treaty with NATO within the framework of Partnership 
for Peace seem to you? When, thereafter, will we join NATO? 
  [Zieleniec] I generally estimate our entry into NATO within 
a 
few years; the entire process, however, is to a considerable 
extent associated with the development of the security situation 
in Europe and throughout Eurasia. As far as signing our 
bilateral agreement with NATO within the framework of 
Partnership for Peace is concerned, I think this is a matter of 
a few months. The government has to discuss the NATO offer 
formally and submit its proposal to the NATO secretary general. 
The Alliance will then submit its proposal on the basis of this. 
These two proposals create the bedrock for treaty-based 
relations. The government must also consider how much money we 
want to spend on this. 
  [Danes] According to the decision made in Brussels, the size 
of the financial investment each country is willing to make in 
the Partnership for Peace will also influence the extent of its 
cooperation with NATO. How much money will our government 
earmark for this plan? 
  [Zieleniec] I will intentionally not answer the question of 
"how much." The issue does not only involve money as such. Our 
participation in the plan must reflect our willingness to take 
part in the activities of the NATO countries and our 
coresponsibility for defending the region of democracy. This is 
an important matter (it is possible to declare anything 
verbally), but we recognize real will according to the 
willingness to make sacrifices. On a specific level, this means 
conducting an analysis of the costs and comparing them with the 
possibilities. Inasmuch as we have not used up our military 
budget, we will draw the money, first and foremost, from it, and 
perhaps we will also add something from other sources. 
  [Danes] Prague has shown a more enthusiastic attitude toward 
the Partnership for Peace than the other Visegrad Four 
countries. Is this because our prospects for exchanging the 
partnership for membership are greater than the prospects of the 
other countries? 
  [Zieleniec] I want to speak not about prospects but, rather, 
about a real estimate of the situation. Of all of the Visegrad 
countries, we had the most unequivocal policy toward NATO. The 
aim of joining the North Atlantic Alliance was expressed, if not 
immediately, then relatively soon after the revolution--as an 
element of the state's political orientation, of course. It 
would be hard to find such unequivocalness in the policy of 
other countries. In some places, I observe a chopping and 
changing--from rejecting NATO and seeking salvation in the CSCE 
to joining NATO immediately. 
  [Danes] I cannot completely agree with you on the issue of 
the unequivocalness of our stance. Your predecessor, Mr. 
Dienstbier, preferred, in contrast to you, a concept for 
creating a single Eurasian security zone and organizations like 
the CSCE.... 
  [Zieleniec] Our stance has been stable since 1992, at least, 
when we won the election. Of course, the Civic Democratic Party 
had an unequivocal stance on this issue before the elections; it 
has had one virtually since its establishment. 
  The Czech approach of steady orientation toward NATO was 
eventually accepted as the most practical one during the Prague 
summit. This does not mean that I could not imagine a better 
option, for example, with a specific entry date and so on. Of 
course, when there is more than one partner, not all of them can 
ever be 100-percent satisfied with the result. If I gauge 
development in the Partnership for Peace plan from the point of 
view of the potential for influencing its final shape, we have 
achieved above-average results. 
  [Danes] A meeting of the Visegrad countries' defense 
ministers, which our Minister Baudys refused to attend, was held 
in Warsaw just before the summit. Polish representatives, in 
particular President Walesa, then accused the Czech Government, 
which was rejecting military cooperation within the framework of 
the Four, of shortsightedness and egoism. The West still views 
these countries as a single geopolitical zone. Are you not 
concerned that the West may interpret our veto on military and 
political coordination within the Four as a destabilizing factor 
in the region? 
  [Zieleniec] We have to confront absolutely this evaluation 
of 
the situation. I would consider the "all or nothing" stance of 
some countries to be more dangerous for stability in the region. 
It is difficult for more than two partners to agree upon the 
"all or nothing" principle. For multilateral cooperation, it is 
always essential to define the areas in which all of the 
participants will agree. 
  The Prague summit, however, also contributed to clarifying 
this issue. It is necessary to deal with security cooperation on 
a bilateral basis--that is, each country with the North Atlantic 
Alliance separately--on account of the very nature of this 
cooperation and to prevent the creation of alternative blocs. 
The Czech Republic cannot accept such a risk. 
  [Danes] Are you aware of any attempts to create an 
alternative military bloc? 
  [Zieleniec] The way things are in policy, if you take the 
first step, logic will push everything forward. The example of 
Visegrad is typical of this. You can see how much passion our 
decision to exempt one aspect from it is arousing in such a 
loose association--in fact, a symbolic association. I agree that 
integration with the North Atlantic Alliance is in our common 
interest, but, if we look farther to the East, our ties and 
those of Poland with the East are not the same. This is because 
our geopolitical situation is different. 
  I think that we would be making a bad job of defending our 
interests if our security interests were exactly the same as the 
security interests of all of the countries in the region. 
Incidentally, U.S. Secretary of State Christopher left his 
colleagues from the Visegrad countries in no doubt about the 
importance of regional cooperation, but cooperation in the 
security sphere must consist, first and foremost, of bilateral 
ties between these states and NATO. This point of view was also 
expressed in the speech delivered in Prague by President 
Clinton. It is essential within the framework of Visegrad to 
execute regional cooperation by carrying out specific deeds, for 
example, in the trade and economic spheres, and not just hold 
ostentatious summit meetings at which the perfidy of the West is 
cursed. 
  This is not our policy. We are transforming our state so 
that 
it becomes a typical element of the West. This cannot be 
replaced by the "banging on the doors" kind of behavior. It is 
not true that, if four fists bang on NATO's doors together it is 
more effective than one fist. We are not banging on doors. We 
are orienting ourselves toward the West definitively and 
straightforwardly.

<F P=106> [Interview with Czech First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr </F>
Vondra by Martin Schmarcz; place and date not given: "Vondra: 
The Czech Republic Could Become a NATO Member in the Nineties"] 
  [Text] After the meeting of the Visegrad Four countries 
with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Prague, various opinions 
have emerged about the Partnership for Peace project. MLADA 
FRONTA DNES asked First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr Vondra 
how he views the Partnership for Peace project and what the 
Czech Republic's attitude toward NATO is. 
  [Schmarcz] The Czech Republic, unlike Poland, for example, 
has very positively accepted the Partnership for Peace project 
since the very beginning. Why? 
  [Vondra] I would correct this statement slightly. We tried 
to 
influence the form of the Partnership for Peace project before 
it was on paper. We wanted the document to be far-reaching 
regarding the prospects of our membership in the Alliance and to 
allow maximum differentiation. This is what we have strived for 
in the past eight months--that is, since the idea was born. 
However, it seemed meaningless to us to sound the alarm when it 
was fairly clear how the Partnership for Peace would look. 
Moreover, it seems to us that the project represents the maximum 
of what the 16 NATO countries are able to agree upon. I believe 
this gives us sufficient room that we can use to push for our 
interests. 
  [Schmarcz] Did the Czech Republic consider getting something 
more from the Alliance after the elections in Russia, as Poland 
did? 
  [Vondra] I believe that this would not be a realistic 
policy. 
In the final stage, we will want to joint the Washington Treaty 
on NATO. For this, we will need the approval of the Czech 
Parliament and of the 16 parliaments of the member countries. If 
we raise unrealistic demands at this moment, some people might 
propose alternatives. We must realize that the Czech Republic 
has no other alternative. 
  [Schmarcz] Can you tell us what the NATO reaction would be 
if 
the situation in Russia became worse? 
  [Vondra] It is a positive fact about the Partnership for 
Peace program that it opens the possibility of real military 
consultations in case of a threat. If the United States has 
clearly said, through its President, that the Czech Republic's 
security is in U.S. vital interests, then it means that, to a 
large extent, they are anticipating our membership. We were 
assured during the talks that, if the situation deteriorated, 
particularly in the East, the Alliance's open policy would have 
to be replaced by "the policy of containment after the Cold 
War." This time, we would be on the same side as democracy and 
the free market. 
  [Schmarcz] When will the Czech Republic join NATO, in your 
view? 
  [Vondra] If there is political will on both sides, this does 
not have to take much time. In any case, I would like this 
country to be firmly anchored to the territory on which the 
values of Western civilization prevail and where it is possible 
to protect them. 
  [Schmarcz] Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev said that Russia 
could join NATO, but there are other possibilities. What are 
they? 
  [Vondra] Minister Kozyrev spoke very clearly about Russian 
endeavors at the most recent CSCE meeting: They want to 
radicalize [radikalizovat] the institutions of which Russia is a 
member, be it the CSCE or the Council for North Atlantic 
Cooperation. The reason is simple: These bodies do not allow the 
Alliance to come closer to the individual countries, and Russian 
clout is greater there, of course. 
  [Schmarcz] How do you view Russia's role in the Partnership 
for Peace project--in view of the rejective declarations on 
NATO's expansion? 
  [Vondra] Russia will try to push for its interests, of 
course, particularly in its immediate neighborhood, as has been 
declared not only by the dark forces of Russian politics but 
also by Russian democrats. To a certain extent, this is quite 
legitimate, and I believe that our task is to keep the Czech 
state where it has belonged during all of its existence. I 
believe that we are not in the sphere of direct Russian 
interest, but that does not mean that we should not cooperate 
with Russia, in the commercial sphere, for instance.

<F P=106> ["RP"-signed report: "Basta Confirmed That After November, </F>
the Secret Services Fabricated Material Against Troublesome 
Journalists"] 
  [Text] In an interview on Friday [21 January] with RUDE 
PRAVO, the former deputy chairman of the Federal Security 
Information Service [FIS] and chairman of the Czech Social 
Democratic Party [CSSD] Security Commission, J. Basta, 
indirectly confirmed the suspicion that the post-November secret 
service fabricated compromising material against journalists 
critical of current officials. 
  "Using the same methods, you are arriving at the same 
conclusions as I have. Of course, I cannot speak about things 
that are still considered state secrets." This is how Basta 
answered a RUDE PRAVO question in connection with the RUDE PRAVO 
article of 15 January that discloses suspicion that the secret 
service fabricated compromising material against troublesome 
journalists that it could use in case of need. 
  "I would be only too happy if some matters could be 
completely clarified. This can apply, for instance, to a 
certain Security Information Service [BIS] or Interior 
Ministry's disposition toward such sensitive issues as the 
freedom of the press," Basta said at the CSSD news conference on 
Friday. Afterward, he told RUDE PRAVO that he was thinking of 
cases of press and public opinion manipulation by the Interior 
Ministry. 
  According to him, other methods were also used to influence 
journalists. As Basta said, "obviously, all means available to 
the secret service were used to this purpose. This includes, 
for instance, the establishment of an opinion-making instrument, 
which can be established by simply providing exclusive 
information regardless of the degree of their secrecy to certain 
journalists. If we glance through RESPEKT magazine since 1990, 
and possibly some other papers of a similar orientation, 
precisely from the point of view of the publishing of classified 
information, we will find at least four infractions or even 
crimes against the law on state secrets," Basta told RUDE PRAVO. 
According to him, the matter of the list of alleged State 
Security [StB] agents in the Syndicate of Journalists also 
merits an investigation. The list was prepared by the FIS in 
1992, but the thing is, nobody was interested in how the 
diskette with the list of Syndicate members got into the hands 
of the FIS agents, Basta observed.

  [Text] Czech Defense Minister Antonin Baudys has ended his 
three-day official visit to Lithuania and returned to Prague. 
Martin Dorazin reports from his news conference: 
  [Dorazin] At a news conference shortly after arriving at the 
old Ruzyne airport, Minister Baudys summed up the contents of 
his visit to Lithuania. During his talks with the Lithuanian 
president, the parliament speaker, and the minister of defense, 
Baudys focused on briefing them on the Partnership for Peace 
project. He also briefed the Lithuanian representatives on our 
attitude toward European security. Let us recall that a desire 
to cooperate with NATO was voiced by representatives of the 
Baltic countries in the so-called letter from three presidents 
to NATO. 
  The Czech minister of defense then got acquainted with the 
situation in the Lithuanian Army, which is undergoing the 
process of building and has problems similar to those of the 
Czech Army. 
  Minister Baudys confirmed that the Czech Republic will grant 
Czech surplus equipment to the Lithuanian Army as a gift. 
  Antonin Baudys expressed mild surprise at the atmosphere 
full 
of trust that accompanied his visit to Lithuania and said that, 
while we have survived socialism, Lithuania survived the USSR.

<F P=106> [CTK report: "Baudys Has Offered Lithuania Some of the Czech </F>
Army's Weapons Free of Charge"] 
  [Text] Prague--Although the Czech Army is ready to donate 
submachine guns, tanks, and radio-navigation equipment to the 
Lithuanian Army, a specific agreement on supplies of the Czech 
Army's surplus armaments to Lithuania has not been concluded. 
This statement was made yesterday by Defense Minister Antonin 
Baudys following his return from a visit to Lithuania. 
  According to Baudys, the reason is that the Lithuanian Army 
does not have a clear concept for its structure or for its 
armament program. 
  Baudys said that the Lithuanian Army, in essence, has no 
equipment; however, a much better atmosphere prevails in it than 
in the Czech Army. According to him, this is because Lithuania 
feels more than the Czech Republic that it has to guarantee its 
own security, first and foremost, alone.

<F P=106> [Article by Kohout: "A Comparison Between Financial Means </F>
for the Interior Ministry and the Secret Service"] 
  [Text] The Security Information Service [BIS] budget is 
secret and so is the number of its staff. According to the 
sources of a CESKY DENIK reporter, the 1994 BIS budget was set 
at 1.2 billion korunas [Kc]. 
  The planned staff of the secret service is approximately 
1,300 employees, but it has not been at full capacity for some 
time now. Approximately 800 employees work in BIS. A rough 
approximation gives us Kc1.5 million per one BIS employee. This 
amount includes the cost of social and health insurance, 
investments, wages, and so forth. 
  The Interior Ministry budget was approved this year in the 
total amount of Kc17.7 billion. After expenditures related to 
the Interior Ministry's Civilian Administrative Department, Fire 
Brigade Main Administration, and investment expenditures of the 
ministry are deducted, there are Kc16.2 billion left for the 
entire Security Department. This amount covers the needs of the 
police and other security divisions--the Foreign Relations and 
Information Office (intelligence), for instance. The employee 
total of all security divisions, including police, comes to 
approximately 56,000. A rough calculation gives approximately 
Kc289,000 per policeman and year. This budget also includes 
social and health insurance premiums, subsidies for subsidized 
organizations and civic associations, operational costs 
(maintenance, repairs, rent, power, etc.). A rough comparison 
shows that the Security Information Service has approximately 
five times greater funds (per worker) at its disposal than 
security divisions under the Interior Ministry umbrella.

carries Dusan Sramek article "Devaty Explains Secret Service 
Budget." It states: "Stanislav Devaty, BIS acting director, 
yesterday described the CESKY DENIK report, according to which 
reporter Lubor Kohout obtained information revealing the amount 
of the BIS budget as Kc1.2 billion, as complete disinformation."]

<F P=106> [Interview with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Martin </F>
Danes; place and date not given: "The Ministry of Culture Is a 
Relic of the Past"] 
  [Text] In the regular interview for our paper, the prime 
minister spoke mostly on the topic of the relations between the 
leadership and the deputies' club of the Civic Democratic Party 
[ODS]. 
  [Danes] Do you share the feeling of Foreign Minister 
Zieleniec that the visit by U.S. President Clinton to Prague and 
the Partnership for Peace plan will bear fruit in the form of 
the expeditious membership of the Czech Republic in NATO? 
  [Klaus] I really cannot say anything new on this topic: At 
present, no one is offering us NATO membership. It would be a 
delusion to dream that we could convince the NATO-member states 
to change their attitude by intense pressure or just by ardent 
rhetoric. Partnership for Peace is a workable way outm and there 
certainly is NATO membership at the end of this road. 
  [Danes] What is a better alternative for you, no Ministry of 
Culture or a Ministry of Culture headed by Pavel Tigrid? 
  [Klaus] Of course, today's option, and at least until the 
elections, is a Ministry of Culture headed by a good person. On 
the long-term basis, I believe that the Ministry of Culture is a 
bit of a relic of the past, and I really believe that we could 
do without it. 
  [Danes] The departure of Deputy Josef Jezek from the ODS and 
the way it was commented on by Deputy Chairman Jiri Vlach are 
only additional signs that relations between the ODS and its 
deputies' club are not in the best shape. What are you planning 
to do to improve them? 
  [Klaus] I do not believe that these relations are not in 
good 
shape or that they are in worse shape than standard relations 
between the executive and the legislative powers anywhere in the 
world. It is perfectly logical, and it must be so, that the 
government and parliament are struggling with each other over 
their powers. It is a normal phenomenon. 
  This week, I spent an entire day in the ODS Deputies' Club, 
and I have not noticed any adverse relations there. It is not 
true, and I believe that it is all being unnecessarily blown out 
of proportion. 
  The problem lies elsewhere. It is, as is common, that there 
are individuals with a very definite one-dimensional orientation 
who contemplate their problem from morning till night. They link 
many other things to settling or not settling this problem 
according to their ideas. This was the case with the 
"cartographer," a technocratic expert on the constitutional 
arrangement, Deputy Jezek, and it is the case with this or that 
deputy, who is mainly concerned with the settlement of the issue 
of the military zones here or there. I could go on listing 
certain monothematic affairs that frustrate individuals. I 
believe that this does not involve any fundamental conflict in 
the overall philosophy, ideology, or political stand, and 
therefore I do not see any reason to make it more dramatic than 
it is. 
  [Zieleniec] I think that we would be making a bad job of 
defending our interests if our security interests were exactly 
the same as the security interests of all of the countries in 
the region. Incidentally, U.S. Secretary of State Christopher 
left his colleagues from the Visegrad countries in no doubt 
about the importance of regional cooperation, but cooperation in 
the security sphere must consist, first and foremost, of 
bilateral ties between these states and NATO. This point of view 
was also expressed in the speech delivered in Prague by 
President Clinton. It is essential within the framework of 
Visegrad to execute regional cooperation by carrying out 
specific deeds, for example, in the trade and economic spheres, 
and not just hold ostentatious summit meetings at which the 
perfidy of the West is cursed. 
  This is not our policy. We are transforming our state so 
that 
it becomes a typical element of the West. This cannot be 
replaced by the "banging on the doors" kind of behavior. It is 
not true that if four fists bang on NATO's doors together it is 
more effective than one fist. We are not banging on doors; we 
are orienting ourselves toward the West definitively and 
straightforwardly.

<F P=106> [Interview with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali by </F>
Ian Mather; place and date not given: "Ties That Bind the Hands 
of the United Nations"] 
  [Text] [Mather] Are you going to order air strikes in 
Bosnia? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] We have received a request from NATO in 
Brussels to study what could be done in Srebrenica and Tuzla. 
But the situation is more complicated than it appears. We have 
already had two preparatory meetings and we hope to have a 
blueprint very soon, in the next few days. 
  [Mather] Why is all this taking so long? You have been 
considering military action for months. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] It is a completely new situation. Until now 
we have been involved with protection. NATO also wants the 
rotation of troops in Srebrenica -- the replacement of the 
Canadian battalion by Dutch troops -- to be carried out. This 
is an operation of a different nature. There is also the 
question of the chain of command. Today, for instance, I had a 
long telephone call from Cairo saying the impression there is 
that NATO is ready to use air strikes, but that I want to 
prevent it from doing so. 
  What can we do when we are dealing with disinformation? The 
chain of command is for the military command on the ground to 
ask for air support. But I cannot take a decision by myself. I 
am not on the ground in Bosnia. And during the past two months 
I have not received any demand for air strikes. 
  [Mather] What about the position of the individual 
governments that would carry out the attacks? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] That is another aspect. Today I received a 
note from the Russian federation saying: "We want to remind you 
that you cannot take any decision before consulting the Security 
Council." So even after I have received a request for air 
strikes and supposing that I am in favour, I have to consult the 
Security Council, according to one of its permanent members. 
This has added a new echelon to the chain of command. 
  [Mather] At the recent NATO summit in Brussels President 
Mitterrand made it clear that he wants force to be used. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Let us be perfectly clear. Supposing that I 
have overcome all the obstacles and I send a message to NATO 
saying "Use force," I have no way to compel NATO governments to 
use force. They are free to do so or not. Who will decide 
within NATO? The member states. 
  [Mather] You have proposed that UN member governments should 
allocate troops permanently to the UN. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Yes. We have received a positive response 
from many countries, from France and from the Scandinavian 
countries. We are proceeding and working very hard on it. But 
then you have the financial element. If you want to send 50,000 
troops to somewhere in Asia or Africa it will cost you a few 
billion dollars. Who will pay? We have a financial crisis in 
the United Nations. 
  [Mather] Is the crisis anywhere near an end? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] No. 
  [Mather] Have governments offered any financial help? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] No. As a result of economic crises and 
"donor fatigue" member states are less ready to contribute 
financially to the peacekeeping operations. 
  The chief problem from my point of view is one of education. 
The same member states that were prepared to spend $100 billion 
every day to sustain the Cold War are not willing to spend $100 
billion or $200 billion to sustain the UN system. That is a 
contradiction. 
  [Mather] Are the UN's peacekeeping efforts actually being 
impeded by the financial crisis? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Yes, because the member states do not pay 
their contributions on time. The result is that the UN is not 
able to pay on time the member states who contribute with 
contingents of troops. Some states can afford to wait one or two 
years before being paid. But others cannot. So they may 
withdraw their troops. I have received complaints from Tunisia, 
Uruguay, Jordan, Egypt and Bangladesh, to name only some of the 
countries which are not able to continue to provide troops 
because they are not being paid. This is a problem. If 
countries that belong to the developing world cannot participate 
in peacekeeping operations for financial reasons it will 
diminish the multinational dimension of UN forces. 
  [Mather] Are some countries guiltier than others? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] The United States and Russia. But out of 184 
countries only ten per cent pay their contributions in January. 
They are supposed to pay all their contributions in the first 
month of the year. But they pay at the end of the year so we 
have to find cash for 12 months and we are not allowed to borrow 
from banks. 
  [Mather] Can you not do more within the UN organisation 
itself to save money? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] Yes, we are trying to. But the cost of 
peacekeeping forces has risen from $600 million to $3.6 billion. 
The UN used to have only a few peacekeeping operations. Today 
we have 23. 
  We have also just agreed to send 1,600 observers to the 
South African elections. We have been asked to participate in 
monitoring 46 elections. All this is new. In the post-Cold War 
era the UN has a new credibility. Everybody is asking for 
assistance in the diplomatic field, in the field of security, in 
the field of the environment and of health and of technical 
assistance. All these different kinds of assistance cost money. 
  [Mather] Do you see any possibility of changing the rules 
of engagement so that UN troops can play a more active military 
role? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] It is not a question of changing the rules of 
engagement but of asking whether the member states are ready. 
Do they accept the need for confrontation with its military 
consequences? Do they accept the likely cost in human lives? 
There is confusion because public opinion regards the UN as an 
independent body. But the UN is an instrument which depends on 
the political will of the member states. If they have the 
political will to pay the military and financial price for an 
operation then it can be done. 
  [Mather] Returning to Bosnia: in addition to the financial 
problems, there are other difficulties. The writ of the UN is 
not respected by the warring parties. Supplies are not getting 
through, UN troops are being shot at and killed. Does all this 
make you feel frustrated? 
  [Butrus-Ghali] This has been the case in all UN peacekeeping 
operations. The UN operations in the Congo had the same 
problems. I don't want to underestimate the problems we have in 
the former Yugoslavia and in Somalia. But we have to accept 
that this happens when the UN is conducting its operations.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Mircea Dascaliuc from Chisinau] </F>
  [Text] In accordance with a decree issued by Igor Smirnov, 
president of the self-proclaimed Dniester republic, a state of 
emergency has been declared in the eastern rayons of the 
Republic of Moldova, starting today and to last until 1 March 
1994, the Tiraspol correspondent of the Chisinau National Radio 
Network reports. 
  Under the pretext that the Republic of Moldova, after the 
introduction of its national currency, has instituted an 
economic blockade against Dniester and also invoking the need to 
regulate the circulation of their own currency and to balance 
the economy, this decree, among other things, prohibits the mass 
media from publishing material calling for the forcible 
overthrow of the current state and social structures or for 
their change, and bans mass demonstrations, which would bring 
about tension in the situation in the area. 
  Similarly, the decree calls on all local executives 
unconditionally to observe the legal norms regarding the state 
of emergency. Local observers believe that the goal of issuing 
this decree is to preserve by all means the current order 
created through force of arms and, at the same time, to stop the 
population from participating in the future early elections for 
the parliament of the Republic of Moldova. As a matter of fact, 
during its session yesterday, the Supreme Soviet of the 
self-proclaimed Dniester republic issued a special declaration 
that the organization of elections and election campaign 
propaganda are prohibited throughout the Dniester region.

<F P=106> [Article by Pavol Vitko: "Political Parties Are Allegedly </F>
Spying Within the Army"] 
  [Text] "Some political parties have gone beyond the 
acceptable limits in wanting to establish collective rights for 
the Hungarian minority in Slovakia. If they want to continue to 
escalate the tension, then they have to be prepared to face the 
state power. No provinces will be established. You and we are 
the guaranties that it will not happen.... This state does not 
intend to give up an inch of its territory. This would provoke 
a conflict in Europe," Prime Minister Meciar said at a meeting 
with Defense Ministry officials in Bratislava yesterday. 
  In this connection, the prime minister explained his opinion 
on the signs in communities with an ethnically mixed population. 
He said that the government demands that the names of 
communities be given in the ethnic minority's language as a 
translation from Slovak. He did not agree with the Castle's 
[the president's] opinion, according to which the ethnic 
minorities can chose their own names. He said that the 
minorities enjoyed rights that are higher than standard, and 
even President Clinton expressed, during a meeting with him, his 
rejective stance on collective rights. Because of that, Prime 
Minister Meciar expressed his hope that the Slovak-Hungarian 
treaty that is being drafted will also contain a passage on the 
inviolability of the borders. 
  "Slovakia accepts the opinion that Europe should be safe for 
all of us. We want to build a unified Europe and we must not 
allow Europe to be partitioned according to the spheres of 
interest," the prime minister continued. He expressed 
satisfaction over our participation in the Partnership For Peace 
project, despite the fact that "some people forgot to mention 
the Slovak Republic in connection with this initiative or 
assumed that Slovakia would not join the initiative." The prime 
minister added that should Zhirinovskiy come to power in Russia, 
a new fascist regime would be installed there representing a 
threat to the whole of Europe. In this connection he stressed 
the need of additional intensive military ties with NATO. 
  Vladimir Meciar said that one of the demands is for the Army 
to introduce tougher discipline, radically intensify training, 
introduce an army structure different from that based on the 
divisions, and establish civilian control over the Army. He 
said that the Slovak Republic Army has a budget of 10 billion 
Slovak korunas [Sk] this year, which is more than last year. 
Next year, the Army will receive even more. He said that as 
repayment of the Soviet debt, the Army should receive technology 
worth $180 million. (Slovak Republic Defense Minister Imrich 
Andrejcak said after the meeting that, in this case, spare 
parts, and not new weapon systems, would be delivered--Editorial 
note.) 
  From the viewpoint of the military development, the prime 
minister described 1994 as a year of government efforts to 
stabilize its position and that of its political partners, so as 
to be able to face political forces that hold different 
opinions. He said that the government expects the economy to 
rebound this year, but the social system will be one or two 
years behind, if for no other reason than because the state will 
have to repay a debt of Sk31.3 billion by 1995, which represents 
Sk24.4 this year, while it was only Sk7 billion last year. 
  In 1990, the Army was depoliticized. This means that 
soldiers and officers must not be members of any political 
party, and they must not perform any activity for any party, 
Vladimir Meciar said. "Some political parties have data on the 
Army, and this is unacceptable. The state is above the Army and 
is not interested in political disputes within the Army. This 
would pose an enormous risk," the prime minister stressed. 
  At the news conference that was supposed to take place after 
the prime minister's speech we wanted to ask which political 
parties have planted their spies within the Army. Prime 
Minister Meciar, however, got rid of the journalists roughly. 
His aide, an officer, was given this task and ordered the 
journalist out of the hall. He said that they had 10 minutes to 
take photos, and then they were to wait in a nearby lobby. Most 
of the journalists did so. When the prime minister came, the 
journalists did not react to his call for questions for about 
three minutes, as some of them were still looking for their 
places. Suddenly, a voice said: "Since there are no questions, 
the news conference is over." Then, Vladimir Meciar and his 
escort left the hall. However, we believe that he will return 
to the problem of spies within the Army....

  [Text] Belgrade, January 22 (TANJUG)--The Yugoslav national 
currency might soon join convertible currencies on the world 
money market because the new dinar will be fully convertible, 
Professor Dr. Dragoslav Avramovic, the author of the programme 
for the country's monetary reconstruction, has said in an 
interview to TANJUG. The new currency will have 100 percent 
backing in hard currency and gold. At the very onset of the 
programme, it will be backed by half a billion dollars, he said. 
  The implementation of the programme for the monetary 
reconstruction will begin on Monday, January 24, and its primary 
objective will be to curb the world record hyperinflation, which 
amounted to one million percent in December. The old dinar will 
remain in circulation in parallel with the convertible dinar, 
but the government has decided to stop the issue of money which 
has no backing. 
  The author of the idea of a "super dinar" said that the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), in spite 
of being under severe international sanctions for 20 months, has 
managed to secure a hard currency backing for the reconstruction 
of its monetary and fiscal system. The state should stimulate 
the return of capital which entrepreneurs, private banks and 
firms took out of the country in the past few years, since this 
could be the most substantial "outside" support to the new 
programme at the present time because of the financial blockade, 
Avramovic said. 
  The exact amount of this capital is not clear--an estimated 
five billion dollars or more--but it would be a significant 
financial backing for the programme in its entirety for a 
long-term period, especially to the convertibility of the dinar. 
  Experts of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last week 
turned down a Yugoslav Government request to join in the 
formulation of the stabilization programme. 
  The United Nations (U.N.) Sanctions Committee has not 
answered Yugoslavia's request of December last year to thaw at 
least part of its hard currency reserves in foreign banks, which 
were frozen 20 months ago when the implementation of the U.N. 
sanctions began. Under the government programme, these funds 
would serve as a backing for the new sound national currency.

  [Text] [Announcer] The president of the Republic of Croatia 
has received Croatian prefects at the Presidential Palace. 
President Tudjman informed the prefects about the basic 
outlines of Croatia's policies, especially those conducted over 
the past couple of days -- the decision on the normalization of 
relations with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY], and the 
talks on ending the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Addressing the prefects, President Tudjman stressed that 
they 
were the most important officials in Croatia's state system. 
Speaking about the historical significance of the present 
moment, and the decision to go ahead with the signing of the 
agreement on the normalization of relations with the FRY, 
President Tudjman underlined that this creates conditions for 
the fastest possible reintegration of Croatian territories under 
the protection of the peacekeeping forces, that is, under 
Serbian occupation, into the constitutional and legal system of 
Croatia. 
  President Tudjman called on all prefects whose counties 
border on these regions to contribute to the creation of 
conditions for the implementation of these policies. 
  [Begin Tudjman recording] As you have seen, the government 
has already reached decisions on the establishment of telephone 
links. You have heard [Tudjman laughs] that their [Serbian] 
representatives themselves said they would agree to the opening 
of the highway via Okucani [Serb-held town in Slavonia on the 
currently-unused Belgrade-Zagreb highway] and a railway line. 
They even mentioned the most sensitive issue -- the opening of 
the Zagreb-Split railway line via Knin [capital of Serb 
Krajina]. I will not go to any pains to emphasize this -- since 
they accept this themselves -- if a citizen of ours can feel 
free to travel via Knin by train, then the problem is 90 percent 
solved. If they [the Serbs] and their representatives -- who 
had boasted about Krajina being an independent state -- if they 
acknowledge this, then it is obvious that we are getting close 
to a peaceful resolution. 
  Of course, we should not deceive ourselves into believing 
that things will go smoothly and we should not completely 
discount the possibility that we might be compelled to resort to 
other means. Nevertheless, I believe that we are on the right 
track, that we have found a way to solve our strategic problem, 
to liberate every square inch of Croatian soil, and to satisfy 
the demands of the international community, which had proposed 
that we refrain from the use of force at all costs. If we were 
to opt for the armed liberation of the UNPA [UN Protected 
Areas], the international community would seriously consider the 
imposition of sanctions. Therefore, those are our interests, 
those are the demands of the international community, this is a 
victory for our policy, this accelerates the return of our 
refugees, this opens up prospects for development in peace. 
[end recording] 
  [Announcer] Pointing out that we are facing serious tasks at 
the beginning of this year, President Tudjman called on the 
prefects to fully cooperate with the Croatian Government. This 
major political victory should be translated into practice 
immediately, to the benefit of the Croatian people and the 
Croatian state, the Croatian president said. 
  At the same time, we are trying to conclude an agreement 
with 
the Bosnian Muslims in order to end the war they are now waging 
against the Croats, with the intention of occupying 
Croat-populated territories, President Tudjman stressed. 
  [Begin Tudjman recording] As serious people who must be 
informed, I can tell you that Izetbegovic proposed to me that, 
he said: Let western Herzegovina be immediately united with 
Croatia. But, he said, allow us to have central Bosnia -- those 
areas of central Bosnia which are envisaged to be part of the 
Croat Republic in the framework of the Union [of Republics] of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. But they [Muslims] are undertaking 
large-scale offensives there. They hoped, even over the 
Christmas holiday, to conquer these areas -- Novi Travnik, 
Vitez, Busovaca, Kiseljak, Kresevo. But, you see, in these 
talks we agreed that of these areas, Kiseljak and Kresevo, 
although these are areas with a majority Croatian population, 
[they] would remain [as heard] in that Bosniak Muslim republic 
in order to satisfy international demands that this Bosniak 
Muslim republic -- in the framework of the Union or 
independently -- might have the territorial conditions for an 
independent existence. But we insisted, and we are insisting, 
that that area of central Bosnia -- Novi Travnik, Vitez, 
Busovaca -- be part of the Croat republic, or if there is 
demarcation [between separate states] they could become areas 
within the Croatian state. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Noting that this is the beginning of a year that 
promises to be even more successful than the previous three, 
President Tudjman stressed that we would realize Croatian state 
objectives by our consistent policy. In implementing this 
policy, we must achieve the unity of the Croatian people, 
President Tudjman said. 
  [Begin Tudjman recording] Let us be consistent in the 
implementation of state policy, and let us work for the unity of 
Croatian ranks. There may be political and party differences, 
but when it is a matter of state interests, there cannot be 
several policies but one policy. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Speaking about the success of the Croatian 
Government in wiping out inflation, President Tudjman said that 
this provides a basis for faith in future economic development. 
Analyzing the introduction of a new convertible currency, he 
recalled that the kuna -- which was the Croatian currency 10 
centuries ago, and which will be something to take pride in 
because the people will know that for the first time in their 
history they will have their own currency -- is being 
introduced. 
  Finally, President Tudjman wished the prefects full success 
in their work for the counties and the whole Croatian state. 
Also present at the reception were Nikica Valentic, the prime 
minister of Croatia, Josip Manolic, the speaker of the Chamber 
of Counties of the Croatian Assembly, and other high-ranking 
officials of the Republic of Croatia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec by Jan </F>
Zizka; place and date not given: "In Our Space, It Is Impossible 
To Become Another Switzerland"] 
  [Text] The results of the meeting between U.S. President 
Clinton and the Visegrad Four countries are the main subject of 
our interview with Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec. 
  [Zizka] The Partnership for Peace plan is being reproached 
for not providing real guarantees to the Central European 
countries. In a meeting with the U.S. President, the Czech 
Republic did not join the criticizing voices that were raised by 
Poland, for instance. Why? 
  [Zieleniec] The Czech Republic, as well as other countries 
in 
this region, is not under an immediate threat. Of course, there 
is a possibility of negative developments in East Europe, 
particularly in Russia. Of course, we would be happy if we were 
admitted into NATO right now or if the Partnership for Peace 
plan provided a clear deadline for our admission. Nevertheless, 
we have accepted the plan with pleasure. The entire plan was 
drafted gradually. It looked quite different when we learned 
about it for the first time. It seemed that it was only a 
proposal for joint exercises and intensifying professional 
contacts between the Armies. The intensive dialogue that we held 
with the NATO countries, particularly with the United States, 
had an impact on the final shape of the Partnership for Peace 
plan. The partnership is built on the civilization's common 
values and on a responsibility toward these values. We feel that 
we view the life and the importance of the freedom of 
individuals in the same way as the West Europeans do, and we are 
happy that the Alliance understands this attitude of ours. I am 
convinced that a quick opening of the Alliance eastward without 
setting clear criteria would not be in our best interests. I 
believe that we should be able to understand the feelings of 
members of the Alliance because we ourselves will certainly 
become a member within several years. If we want this 
organization to be efficient and able to secure its goals--that 
is, the protection of our life-style--this organization cannot 
admit a country that is not stable politically or whose 
appreciation of the said values is not so patent. 
  [Zizka] In the past, the Alliance admitted countries such as 
Greece and Turkey, which did not meet the criteria for admission 
at that time. 
  [Zieleniec] In the past, the Alliance was an anticommunist 
pact. The problem of common values was not so important. The 
main task was to stop communism. Now, the Alliance wants to 
assume a new face. It seeks to find a new raison d'etre for its 
existence. Admitting a country that does not fully accept the 
said values and that is not prepared to defend them without 
hesitation could create an opportunity for establishing a fifth 
column within the Alliance, which would then become more 
vulnerable in view of outside pressures. 
  [Zizka] Are you then rejecting the opinion that injustice 
has 
been done to us? Some people in the Czech Republic believe that 
this a new Munich or Yalta. 
  [Zieleniec] The politicians who used these words before the 
summit have stopped using them. The fact that they agree with us 
also demonstrates the stability and unequivocality of Czech 
foreign policy. Since the elections in 1992, our efforts to 
become a NATO member and assume responsibility for the Western 
values have become the key pillar of our policy. Many people in 
neighboring countries who vehemently speak about joining NATO 
did not even think about joining it several months ago. 
  [Zizka] Did you ever see any danger in the fact that 
admitting the Central European countries into NATO could, sooner 
or later, lead to a new division of Europe and that Russia and 
other countries could find themselves on the other side? 
  [Zieleniec] Europe's security system has always been based 
on 
a certain structure and division. Two blocs do not have to stand 
against one another and pose a threat to one another. On the 
other hand, I repeat, the Alliance is a defense alliance that 
secures freedom and democracy. Let us be sincere. All countries 
do not have the same life-style, and not everywhere is the state 
based on the same values. Democracy is not in all countries. 
  [Zizka] Should we take into account the fact that NATO's 
eastward expansion could strengthen the position of Russian 
nationalists? 
  [Zieleniec] I believe that the West's reaction in the form 
of 
the Partnership for Peace plan is quite adequate. It allows a 
flexible reaction to possible developments in Europe--in Russia, 
in particular--and gives us the opportunity to either become a 
member of democratic European countries that accept the values 
on which Western civilization has been built or to go in the 
opposite direction. 
  [Zizka] This is the viewpoint of the West. What is the 
viewpoint of the Central European countries? Should we also try 
to prevent Russian nationalists from gaining more power? 
  [Zieleniec] This is not only our problem or the West's. 
Russia is a nuclear power. It is a pan-European and even a 
worldwide problem. However, we should not forget that the Czech 
Republic's membership in the Western key structures is not a 
question of our immediate profit in the economic or security 
spheres. To us, it is a question of demonstrating our historical 
identity and our place within the civilization. All of our 
history is the history of a Western civilization. The fact that 
45 years ago the Iron Curtain was established on our borders and 
we were separated from the countries that belong to our family 
as regards civilization, culture, and history does not mean that 
we should forget the thousand years of our history. 
  [Zizka] Is our NATO membership a necessary condition? 
Switzerland is not a member of the Alliance; nevertheless, no 
one doubts that Switzerland belongs to Western civilization. 
  [Zieleniec] I could cite more examples--Sweden, for 
instance. 
Switzerland is in a different place than the Czech Republic. It 
is impossible to become another Switzerland. We must take a firm 
position in this space; otherwise, we could end up somewhere we 
do not belong or want to belong to. The geographic position--or, 
better, the geopolitical situation--plays a key role here. Our 
situation adds shape to our history. Switzerland is Switzerland 
because of where it is. 
  [Zizka] Were you not afraid that Clinton's visit could be 
adversely affected by reports that the Federal Security and 
Information Service and some politicians had tried to support 
former President Bush in the election campaign? 
  [Zieleniec] No. I believe that the United States is a 
serious 
partner who would not want to put unverified reports on the 
agenda of such an important meeting. We have to wait for the 
results. I know that the appropriate authorities are conducting 
an investigation. I must say that I would be very sorry if the 
reports proved to be true. 
  [Zizka] The Czech Republic was against coordinating the 
Visegrad countries' stance before the meeting. Does that mean 
that Prague wants to spread propaganda about its exclusiveness? 
  [Zieleniec] No. We did not want to coordinate our course of 
action. Finally, however, everyone took the same stance. The 
whole Partnership for Peace plan is conceived as bilateral 
relations between NATO and other countries. I do not believe 
that it would be proper to cooperate in our region in any way 
other than by holding consultations. A more binding cooperation 
would be a direct road toward establishing alternative security 
structures. This contradicts our objectives--that is, our early 
admission to NATO. I believe that this is also clear to our 
partners. There is another problem: Our views are very 
different. We have not adopted the all-or-nothing strategy with 
respect to NATO. It is not because we are too cautious or that 
we would be satisfied with the little we could get, but there 
are reasons that I have already explained. I am afraid that, 
because of this, it was not possible to formulate our common 
stance. 
  [Zizka] If, in the future, there are similar differences in 
our views and we are not able to coordinate our joint course of 
action when holding talks with Western institutions, the 
Visegrad Four's role of conducting political dialogue will 
dwindle. A solitary Czech voice will become hardly audible then, 
will it not? 
  [Zieleniec] I do not believe so. The Partnership for Peace 
plan testifies to the fact that they have listened to us. It is 
important to create a good atmosphere in regional cooperation. 
We should cooperate in the economy, as well as in the spheres 
that are closely related to the problem of the 
regions--environment, infrastructure, transportation network, 
and energy supply. Of course, it is also important to be able to 
solve political problems in our region. When we have this, plus 
bilateral relations, the feeling of togetherness should prevail 
in the region. Yet, I would like to stress again that I do not 
understand the all-or-nothing attitude, which we heard about in 
connection with the Visegrad cooperation. Those who have adopted 
this attitude are damaging a vast sphere in which cooperation is 
possible and in which something has already been done. Everyone 
knows about a situation in his own life where more people had to 
jointly fight to push for a certain thing. In such a situation, 
a man who wants to force his all-or-nothing attitude upon others 
becomes a destructive element. One of the basic features of 
Western civilization is its ability to fruitfully cooperate and 
do constructive work. I spoke about it with my partners, and I 
believe that, when they were leaving Prague, they changed their 
opinion, which is also due to the influence of our U.S. friends. 
I hope that the summit, despite what we heard during its 
preparation, will become a very positive influence that will 
help intensify and accelerate cooperation within the Visegrad 
group. 
  [Zizka] You stressed the fact that the economic sphere and 
specific projects are the most important things in regional 
cooperation. It also depends on the political contacts, whether 
trust or mistrust will be established between countries. Certain 
actions of Czech diplomacy--be it the absence of the defense 
minister at the consultative meeting or your statement at the 
time of the preparation of the summit, when you said that the 
summit would have mostly a bilateral character--met with a 
negative reaction. 
  [Zieleniec] I only described how much time will be devoted 
to 
what. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the 
summit was as I said: The first day was devoted to Czech-U.S. 
bilateral relations, and the second also had mostly a bilateral 
character inasmuch as the United States conducted talks with 
individual countries of the Visegrad Four. The dinner in honor 
of President Clinton was the first multilateral action. The 
increased nervousness, particularly in Poland, caused other 
people to think that we wanted to usurp the entire meeting. This 
was not the case. We were not influenced by the nervousness that 
prevailed during the preparation of the meeting, and we 
continued to push for our objectives. The Visegrad partners 
finally left Prague satisfied. Their words testify to it. Slovak 
Prime Minister Meciar rejected opinions that the Czech Republic 
is a partner that does not want to cooperate. President Walesa 
also eased up on his critical statements. 
  [Zizka] You mentioned Meciar's statements. His words are a 
significant reversal because, shortly before that, Ivan Mjartan, 
Slovak ambassador to Prague, said that the Czech Republic's 
attitude could destabilize the region. Does that mean that a new 
Czech-Slovak partnership is in the offing? 
  [Zieleniec] Our bilateral relations with Slovakia are a very 
important matter. I believe that the reason for this shift, not 
only in Slovakia's opinion but also in Poland and Hungary's, has 
been caused by our diplomacy's decent and calm attitude toward 
the preparation of the summit. We explained to our partners now 
and again what the essence of our policy was. We explained our 
efforts to search for a more intensive cooperation without 
having to compromise on our stance. I believe that U.S. 
diplomacy also helped us achieve that goal. During a meeting 
with foreign ministers, Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
stressed several times that bilateral relations were important 
for establishing the security system in our region. 
  [Zizka] How do you view the Hungarian proposal to jointly 
sign a treaty applicable to the Partnership for Peace plan? 
  [Zieleniec] Again, this is a search for symbols and a matter 
of stressing something that is not important at all. 
  [Zizka] Some people are saying that the organization of 
Clinton's visit was in the hands of the Americans. Czech 
correspondents did not have easy access to individual events. 
The security measures taken by the Americans blocked traffic in 
Prague. The Czechs should have been given more clout in that 
matter, should they not have? 
  [Zieleniec] President Clinton is a man who has enormous 
power 
due to the Constitution of the United States and the role the 
United States plays in the world. This power often represents 
the existential issue for the entire humankind. Because of 
Kennedy's assassination in 1963, no wonder the United States has 
become very concerned with the security of its presidents. The 
visible part of the security measures was only a tiny part of 
the entire job the United States had to do on our territory. It 
is true that it complicated the life of many Prague citizens. I 
would like to thank them for having coped with the situation. On 
the other hand, I would also like to say that our laws and 
sovereignty have not been violated at all. Our correspondent had 
a difficult time getting to various events. This is the negative 
side of the fact that there were hundreds of foreign 
correspondents who referred to this event and transmitted the 
picture of Prague and its representatives to the world. Two 
billion people all over the world watched the visit. This is no 
small effect of the visit. It paid off to put up with 
discomfort, if not for other reasons, then for this effect.

  [Excerpts] London, Jan 21 (AFP) -- Britain and France said 
Friday [21 January] that the option of pulling all United 
Nations troops out of Bosnia-Herzegovina, possibly as early as 
this spring, was being given serious consideration. [passage 
omitted] 
  In other developments Friday, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris 
Silajdzic hailed an agreement signed Tuesday between Belgrade 
and Zagreb to normalize their relations, saying it could be a 
turning point in the peace process. 
  Speaking after returning from Geneva, he said that the 
agreement "could serve as a solid base for re-establishing 
peace." 
  "We are ready to take part in a peace process on a new basis 
of mutual recognition of former Yugoslav republics which have 
already been internationally recognized," he said. 
  In Bosnia itself the situation was calm on most fronts for a 
second successive day, according to officials. UN Protection 
Force spokesman Bill Aikman said Thursday had been the calmest 
day for months. 
  However Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said that 
Bosnian Moslems were preparing to attack Serb positions across 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  He made the comments in a letter to Greek officials who had 
invited him to Athens Friday. He cancelled the trip at the last 
minute because of what he called the "new difficulties." 
  "A vast Moslem attack on all our positions is being 
prepared... I must work at the same time for peace and work to 
defend my country," he said, excusing himself from the Athens 
trip.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Ion Iliescu by Dorina Baesu in </F>
Bucharest on 20 January: "Brief Interview With Mr. Ion Iliescu 
After the Talks Between the Social Democracy Party of Romania 
and the President: `I Agree With Salagean'"] 
  [Text] [Baesu] Today, during your talks with the Social 
Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR], the PDSR leaders asked you to 
further remain actively involved in the negotiations it will 
conduct with the opposition. Are you going to do that? 
  [Iliescu] This is what I am actually doing. I believe that 
today's discussions with the PDSR are the start of the second 
stage of the meetings with all parties. I will stay involved. 
  [Baesu] Therefore, the negotiations with the opposition -- 
which, in the opinion of Mr. Nastase [PDSR executive president], 
are bound to last a long time -- will begin. Until then, a 
coalition government between the PDSR and the Romanian National 
Unity Party [PUNR] will be formed. Will this coalition not 
damage the country's image? 
  [Iliescu] It might do some damage, but this is the formula 
that resulted from the discussion. 
  [Baesu] But why was it absolutely necessary to form a 
government with the PUNR? 
  [Iliescu] This is not necessary, but inevitable. 
  [Baesu] Why? 
  [Iliescu] Because it offers stability, for the time being. 
  [Baesu] PUNR senator Viorel Salagean claims that such a 
government will not only damage the country's image, but it will 
not last too long, either. 
  [Iliescu] I agree with Salagean, but the party should also 
agree with him. 
  [Baesu] What do you have to say about the fact that several 
politicians, including Adrian Nastase, were accused by Corneliu 
Vadim Tudor [president of the Greater Romania Party-PRM] of 
being CIA spies? 
  [Iliescu] This is stupid and despicable. He could be sued 
for that. It is proof of his irresponsibility. 
  [Baesu] Nevertheless, the PRM is still the PDSR's ally. Is 
such an alliance not being perceived negatively? 
  [Iliescu] I agree with you. It is perceived rather badly. 
  [Baesu] Then, what should be done to ensure that the PDSR is 
no longer obliged to have such an ally as the PRM? 
  [Iliescu] We must create another political climate, of 
understanding among the democratic forces. However, I would 
like to emphasize that I do not identify the parties with their 
figures. A man is not a party. As a matter of fact -- I do not 
want to name any names right now -- there are certain elements 
in the Democratic Convention (people -- our editorial note), 
that are by no means any more credible or desirable than some 
individuals from the current majority. 
  [Baesu] Still, none of the Convention's leaders has ever 
made a statement like Corneliu Vadim Tudor's. 
  [Iliescu] Well, let me assure you that they have made quite 
a few statements, and how! 
  [Baesu] Can you give some concrete examples... 
  [Iliescu] Is there a need for examples? By the way, what 
newspaper do you work for? 
  [Baesu] ROMANIA LIBERA. 
  [Iliescu] You see? Just the insolence of the writings of 
Petre Mihai Bacanu and Octavian Paler would suffice as examples 
of that.

<F P=106> [Interview with Stojan Rumenovski, leader of the diplomatic </F>
mission of the Republic of Macedonia in Sofia, by Mariyana 
Boyadzhieva; place and date not given: "Bulgaria's Recognition 
of Macedonia Was Welcomed With Esteem and Gratitude"] 
  [Excerpts] [Boyadzhieva] Two years ago, Bulgaria was the 
first to recognize the independence of the Republic of 
Macedonia. How has this fact contributed to the development of 
bilateral relations? 
  [Rumenovski] For the past two years, Bulgarian-Macedonian 
relations have been developing positively. Bulgaria's 
recognition of the Republic of Macedonia was welcomed with 
esteem and gratitude both at the highest level and by all the 
Macedonian people, as well as by all the remaining citizens of 
the republic, as you know well. Furthermore, this act acted as a 
stimulus for developing mutual contacts in specific fields. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Boyadzhieva] Has the position that Greece has adopted 
regarding the name of the Republic of Macedonia hampered the 
young state from establishing itself internationally? 
  [Rumenovski] The Republic of Macedonia is an equal member of 
the world community and the United Nations. It has received 
international recognition from over 50 countries, most of which 
have established diplomatic relations. These include all the 
members of the European Union, China, Russia, Japan, and others. 
Macedonia does not threaten any of its neighbors. Our 
independence and international recognition are not a cause of 
instability. Quite the contrary, we have demonstrated -- and 
the world is convinced of it -- that an independent Macedonia is 
a factor that prevents the war from spreading. The Macedonian 
state is a key factor for Balkan peace and stability. 
  If I have to give a specific answer, it is certainly true 
that Greece's position delayed the process of recognizing 
Macedonia but failed to halt it. This is an irreversible 
process because Macedonia is established as an entity in 
international law. 
  [Boyadzhieva] Bulgarian-Macedonian relations are developing 
well at the personal level. What is hindering them from 
developing better at the interstate level? The position adopted 
by official representatives in Skopje is strange, to put it 
mildly, especially regarding the two countries' histories. 
  [Rumenovski] I would not completely agree with this 
assessment. On the contrary, official political contacts are 
developing well, as I mentioned previously. With no other 
neighboring country is the Republic of Macedonia developing such 
lively political contacts. Many ministries maintain regular 
contacts between one another. Our Foreign Ministries hold 
periodical consultations. However, the political will for 
cooperation is not being sufficiently well expressed in concrete 
terms. The reason for this is that the legal basis for our 
relations has not yet been developed. 
  Many bilateral agreements are in the process of preparation. 
We have already concluded an agreement on economic and 
commercial cooperation, a consular agreements, and so on. 
  As far as history is concerned, it is possible that the 
picture seems like this from Sofia's viewpoint. This is 
understandable, because many things have been inherited from the 
old system and prejudices have accumulated over the years. Both 
sides have a lot of work to do on overcoming these viewpoints, 
and this will be achieved by developing cooperation in all 
spheres, thus strengthening the trust between the two countries. 
Similarly, it is normal to expect that the contradictions and 
differences of view in this direction will be overcome. 
  [Boyadzhieva] Bulgaria has opened its embassy in Skopje. 
Will Skopje respond by making a similar gesture, and how will 
this contribute to bilateral contacts? 
  [Rumenovski] The establishment of diplomatic relations 
between Macedonia and Bulgaria was reciprocal. On 21 December 
1993, the two Foreign Ministries exchanged notes on raising the 
consulates general in Skopje and Sofia to the level of 
embassies. The raising of our interstate relations to the 
highest level will certainly speed up and enrich both the 
development of Macedonian-Bulgarian relations and understanding 
and friendship between our two peoples. In the very near 
future, Macedonia will seek approval for its first ambassador in 
Sofia. This will open a new page in the relations between the 
two countries and peoples.

  [Excerpts] Following his meeting with Foreign Minister 
Jozef Moravcik and the subsequent signing of the memorandum on 
cooperation between UNIDO [United Nations Industrial Development 
Organization] and Slovakia, UNIDO Director General Mauricius de 
Maria y Campos was received this morning by Slovak President 
Michal Kovac. Jozef Rebo has the details: 
  [Rebo] [passage omitted] Slovakia is ready for bilaterally 
advantageous cooperation with UNIDO. Regarding specific matters, 
the president said that Slovakia would welcome concrete 
assistance from UNIDO, in particular in economic transformation. 
Privatization is also closely linked to economic transformation. 
We also expect assistance in putting into effect environmental 
projects and new technologies. 
  On the other hand, Slovakia wants to contribute to UNIDO 
work 
and get involved in assistance to Third World countries. We are 
able to join mining and metallurgy projects, projects in the 
construction industry, engineering, timber-processing, chemical, 
and electrotechnical industries. 
  In reply, Mr. Campos said that UNIDO respected Slovakia's 
efforts in the sphere of industrial development and that UNIDO 
wished to continue to support our efforts. [passage omitted] Mr.

welcomed to the Belweder Slovak President Michal Kovac, who is 
on his first official visit to Poland. The Sejm and senate 
speakers and the prime minster took part in the ceremony. 
  After the welcoming ceremony, both presidents began 
face-to-face talks. After this meeting, plenary talks will be 
held between the two delegations. A PAP journalist has learned 
unofficially that the agreements on regional cooperation and

  [Text] Warsaw, 25 Jan--After a private meeting of 
presidents Lech Walesa and Michal Kovac, the Polish and Slovak 
delegations began plenary talks at Belweder Palace at noon. 
  President Walesa expressed hope that, in spite of many 
internal problems, both countries "will draw closer and closer." 
According to the president, the future lies in a Europe of 
"open borders" and regional cooperation. "We would like no 
decisions concerning us to be made in our absence," Walesa 
underscored. 
  According to the president, politicians of both countries 
are 
facing the task of opening up to greater economic cooperation. 
"I believe that we will manage to begin doing good and honest 
business, as it should be between neighbors." 
  President Kovac said that the Slovak Republic considers 
friendship with Poland to be one of the main pillars for 
building its international position. Kovac underscored that, 
although every state in the Visegrad Group will conclude 
individual agreements with NATO on the Partnership for Peace 
program, a "group is the best instrument to contribute to our 
admission to NATO." 
  To improve security in Europe, Kovac suggested regular 
contacts between the defense and internal affairs ministries of 
both countries.

  [Text] Slovak President Michal Kovac today started his 
official visit to Poland. Miroslav Karas, our Warsaw 
correspondent, reports: 
  [Karas] After his arrival by air shortly before noon, Michal 
Kovac first met his Polish counterpart for a half-hour talk. 
Lech Walesa stressed to journalists that this was the first 
visit of the president of independent Slovakia to Poland. We 
are neighbors, and we want to be good neighbors. We have a lot 
of internal political and economic problems, but their solution 
will bring us common results. I wish that nothing concerning us 
be undertaken in Europe without us. Regional cooperation is the 
future for the Europe of the 21st century, which will lead to 
the disappearance of borders, the Polish president said. 
  According to Michal Kovac, the Slovak Republic considers 
friendship with Poland one of the most important cornerstones in 
the building of the international position of Slovakia. For the 
first time in history, a situation has been created in which not 
only Slovakia and Poland, but more countries of the Central 
European region, have common and identical interests, the Slovak 
president said and added that, even if we are trying to overcome 
the division of Europe, we realize that it will be a long-term 
and complicated process, and one has to realize the fact that 
the countries of the Visegrad Group have their specific 
interests in this process. 
  In this connection, Kovac stressed that the Slovak Republic 
realizes the great significance of the mutual cooperation of the 
Visegrad Group countries in the sphere of security. Accepting 
the Partnership for Peace plan, which we will be concluding with 
NATO individually, should be an incentive for better cooperation 
and exchange of experiences. I am convinced that cooperation of 
the Visegrad Four is the most important thing we can contribute 
toward becoming bona fide members of NATO, Slovak President 
Michal Kovac said. 
  In the afternoon, he met Polish Prime Minister Waldemar 
Pawlak, the minister of foreign economic relations, and Cardinal 
Glemp.

<F P=106> [Relayed by Warsaw TV Polonia Network in Polish] </F>
  [Text] [Announcer Krystyna Czubowna] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
will arrive in Poland on 27 January on a private visit. This 
was decided by Polish politicians, claims Janusz Bryczkowski, 
who has invited the leader of the Russian nationalists. In his 
opinion, ignoring a politician of this standing is proof of a 
lack of the self-preservation instinct. 
  [Correspondent Wojciech Hoflik] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy will 
be 
accompanied by his closest colleagues, including Aleksandr 
Vengerovskiy, deputy president of the Russian [State] Duma, 
among others. They will visit Warsaw, Krakow, Auschwitz, and 
Grunwald. 
  [Janusz Bryczkowski, leader of the Self-defense National 
Front, identified by caption] It is not a tribute to be paid to 
those who were murdered in Auschwitz. This was not our aim. 
The motivation was simply human curiosity of a man who would 
like to see the Auschwitz [concentration] camp. [video shows 
Bryczkowski speaking at a news conference] 
  [Hoflik] Up until now, no Polish politicians, other than the 
ones who support the [Self-Defense National] Front, have 
expressed their willingness to meet the leader of the Russian 
nationalists, although, according to Bryczkowski, they still 
have a chance to do so. It is even more worrying because this 
may be the last opportunity to improve the poor relations with 
our eastern neighbor, Janusz Bryczkowski believes. This is 
called for by Polish raison d'etat. 
  [Bryczkowski] Unfortunately, after the division of Europe 
imposed by Stalin, we were given a part of Europe to which we 
have no full territorial rights, and one must openly talk about 
this. However, one must also openly say that, despite the fact 
that we have no full rights to these territories that we were 
given, we will, at the same time, insist that the European 
borders not be changed, as Mr. Zhirinovskiy and other great 
Russian Federation politicians have declared it. 
  [Hoflik] Members of the Self-Defense National Front feel 
strong bonds with the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and are 
counting on close cooperation with this group. We are not 
Fascists, Bryczkowski stresses, unless everyone who struggles 
for sovereignty is a Fascist. 
  [Vladimir Voronkov, press councillor of the embassy of the 
Russian Federation, identified by caption, speaking in Polish to 
camera] This is Mr. Zhirinovskiy's private visit. He has not 
been invited by the Polish Sejm but by political parties. This 
is all I can say. 
  [Hoflik] Do you envisage the possibility of a scandal, like, 
for example, in Bulgaria? 
  [Voronkov] We hope it will not come to that. 
  [Hoflik] Is the embassy on alert? 
  [Voronkov] No, not at all.

<F P=106> [Studio debate by Polish Finance Minister Marek Borowski, </F>
former Finance Minister Jerzy Osiatynski, economist Professor 
Grzegorz Kolodko, and university student Piotr Poleski, 
moderated by Jerzy Baczynski on the "Only on One" program in 
Warsaw--live] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Baczynski, addressing 
Borowski] Mr. Minister, the prime minister--that is your 
boss--said that servicing the domestic debt has become a serious 
burden on the state. How serious is it? 
  [Borowski] Well, one can illustrate this through several 
examples. Let us take the 1994 expenditures devoted to the 
health service, which amount to a total of about 84 trillion 
zlotys [Z], whereas servicing our domestic debt amounts to Z82 
trillion. The Defense Ministry's entire budget, about which 
there is currently a huge ongoing fight and debate, amounts to 
Z47 trillion. The Internal Affairs Ministry's entire 
budget--that is to say, for public security--amounts to more 
than Z20 trillion, and the budget of the Education Ministry is 
Z67 trillion. Or let us look at this from a different 
perspective: If it was not for the domestic debt incurred 
toward domestic banks and other institutions, we would have no 
budget deficit in 1994 at all. [passage omitted] 
  [Baczynski, addressing viewers] We are waiting for your 
responses to the following question, and let me remind you what 
it is: In a situation where the state lacks money to devote to 
important expenditures like the health service, education, or 
retirement pensions, should the state borrow money or not? 
Should it incur debts or should it not? We are waiting for 
your responses, and right now I can see that the result is, I 
think, four to one to No, so most of you so far think that the 
state budget should not incur a debt. We will see whether you 
will change your minds as the program continues. 
  Let me remind you that the biggest part of our debt is made 
up of debts incurred toward foreign creditors, which right now, 
Mr. Prime Minister [addressing Borowski], I think amounts to 
$47.5 billion, as far as I can recall.... 
  [Borowski] The figure keeps changing everyday because the 
foreign-currency rates keep changing, but it is something like 
that. 
  [Baczynski] Please, tell us--how much will we have to spend 
this year to service this foreign debt? 
  [Borowski] Our assumptions are that it will have to be about 
Z30 trillion, which, taking the average dollar exchange rate for 
1994, is about $1.3 billion. 
  [Baczynski] But this is based on the assumption that we will 
manage to get the debt reduction talked about during the 
background report? 
  [Borowski] Yes, it is based on that assumption. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Baczynski] So the situation looks like quite a paradox 
indeed: We are making efforts to have our debts--incurred in 
commercial banks--reduced, but if we manage to obtain the 
reduction, we will have to repay more than we have been paying 
up to now since up to now we have been servicing the debt only 
to some extent. But we are doing this--it is my 
understanding--among other things in order to obtain new 
credits. Which brings me to my next question to the minister 
and deputy prime minister: It is bad enough that we have this 
enormous burden of old debts, but we also keep incurring new 
ones. We heard data during the background report concerning the 
amount of money lent to us by the IMF, the World Bank, and the 
EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]. After 
having had some experience with the state's finances already, do 
you think that we were justified in incurring those new credits? 
Are we using them the right way? 
  [Borowski] To kind of continue the tradition that Professor 
Osiatynski has initiated, I will also begin with something other 
than what the question was about. Namely, the professor talked 
here about the great success of "Solidarity" governments 
concerning the form of foreign-debt reduction. I share this 
view and that was indeed an achievement, but, in all fairness, 
we should add something that was not an achievement of 
"Solidarity" governments--namely, that these governments failed 
to sufficiently develop a proexport economy in Poland. What was 
supposed to be a lesser burden as a result of export development 
after a few years, after the reduction, when both the debt 
repayments and interest-rate repayments were supposed to begin 
increasing--unfortunately, that is getting ever less realistic 
currently, or it is being made very difficult since we are 
facing a major foreign-trade deficit and that is also a major 
problem that our economy is facing. [passage omitted] But I 
would like to answer Mr. Baczynski's question now. 
  [Baczynski] Thank you. 
  [Borowski] Well, regarding the credits you asked about, 
if we are to conduct a restructuring--I apologize to Mr. 
Student here for using the word--of the economy, and if we are 
to modernize industry, build highways, or modernize the 
telecommunications network, Poland of course does not have its 
own internal capital to accomplish all that. So Poland has to 
borrow money, but these are the types of loans that will pay 
back in the future, on the condition of course that they were 
made the right way.... 
  [Baczynski] And were they in fact? 
  [Borowski, hesitating] I think we do not know everything 
regarding this issue right now since there are different 
messages coming in. I want to say that a World Bank mission 
will come to Poland in the near future to conduct evaluations 
along with us on how these credits are being used. There are 
some already known cases, which were also questioned by the 
Supreme Chamber of Control, of not very good use of these 
credits, but I would not like to make general statements in this 
regard. I think there are quite a few loans that are being 
implemented the right way. [passage omitted] 
  [Baczynski, addressing Kolodko] You just said, Professor: Is 
there anybody to borrow money from? I think we should return to 
the question asked by Mr. Poleski here--namely, who does the 
state borrow money from? 
  [Borowski] Exactly. Perhaps we should explain this since it 
is a fundamental issue. Well, in a situation of a budget 
deficit, which means revenue from taxes and other sources are 
lower than the budget expenditures, one must find a way of 
getting money from some source. People in Poland often talk in 
terms of: Well, the deficit is just something you can live 
with, there is always a way to finance it, we can always write 
it down and then spend the money somehow. But the problem is 
the budget must have a way of finding the money that is the 
deficit, so where will it find it? Well, the government can of 
course sell its securities among other things, such as 
television commercials, and perhaps our student colleague here 
has even purchased one already, and, if not, I recommend it 
highly since it really pays back.... [passage omitted] 
  So like I said, government securities are one way but there 
is not much to be gained this way, and the other possibility 
that was used extensively was simply through bank loans. Banks 
have money they collect from citizens.... [passage omitted] 
  I would like to present an interesting interpretation of the 
domestic debt issue here. Let us look at it this way: Banks 
have collected money from citizens, then they lent the money to 
the state Treasury, that is the budget. The budget then spent 
the money.... 
  [Baczynski, interrupting] For socially justifiable reasons? 
  [Borowski] Undoubtedly they were socially justifiable 
reasons, and this way the citizens also used the money because, 
after all, employees of the health service, the education 
system, the Army, and so forth--all of them are citizens. So 
one can put it this way, at the expense of some simplification: 
Some citizens lent money to some other citizens. Perhaps in 
some cases they were even the same people since after all, the 
savings were collected by everyone. All this money was 
processed through the banks and through the budget itself and so 
what am I getting at? Well, what I am getting at is that if 
there are some people out there today who perhaps say: Why 
don't we just not repay that? After all, these are state-owned 
banks and a state-owned budget so what is the fuss all about? 
Well, what I am saying to that is that would simply mean that 
somebody will not get his money if the debt is not repaid. So 
not repaying the debt is out of the question here. What is 
possible with foreign debt for instance, in terms of some form 
of negotiation of debt remission, delays in repayments and so 
forth since at the other end you have enormous banks with 
enormous potentials--well, that is not possible with regard to 
domestic debt. [passage omitted]

  [Editorial Report] Bratislava REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 17 
January on page 2 carries a 250-word TA SR report entitled 
"Priority of the Finance Department: Introducing Clarity Into 
Incomes." The report quotes an interview given by Finance 
Minister Julius Toth to the TA SR on 16 January, in which he 
discussed the "priorities of the Ministry of Finance this year." 
Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak on 20 January on page 2 carries a 
600-word TA SR report entitled "Even Though There Is No 
Agreement, They Are Doing It." The report quotes a statement 
issued by the Slovak National Bank [NBS] in response to the Toth 
interview. 
  The TA SR report in the 17 January issue of Bratislava 
REPUBLIKA in Slovak includes the following passage: "In an 
interview for the TA SR, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Finance Julius Toth said that introducing good order and 
exactness into state budget incomes and expenditures was one of 
the priorities of the finance department this year. According 
to his words, it was precisely this issue that was causing 
considerable problems in the first year of independent 
Slovakia's existence. The NBS, which monitors expenditures, was 
not able to carry out certain studies and analyses that would 
show in which areas the budget management was getting into an 
undesirable situation." 
  In its response in the 20 January issue of Bratislava PRAVDA 
in Slovak, the NBS terms Toth's remark "a surprising assertion" 
because "according to the legal system, it is the Ministry of 
Finance of the Slovak Republic that is responsible for the 
formulation and implementation of the state budget." The NBS 
statement goes on to say: "Under the law on the NBS, monitoring 
expenditures of the state budget is not among the duties of the 
central bank, and no agreement on such activity has been 
concluded between the NBS and the Ministry of Finance of the 
Slovak Republic. In spite of this, central bank staffers 
prepare regular reports on the development of the budget economy 
and on the government's net position regarding individual items 
and draw attention to key problems." According to the NBS, "in 
the course of 1993, the NBS repeatedly notified the Ministry of 
Finance of the Slovak Republic about the unfavorable development 
of the budget and demanded that appropriate measures be adopted 
to keep the budget deficit within acceptable limits. With this 
in mind, an agreement had been reached to limit the drawing of 
budget expenditures to a total 165 billion Slovak korunas [Sk] 
by 31 December 1993. In the last days of December, it was 
decided to exceed this limit, as a result of which budget 
expenditures reached Sk167.1 billion. The NBS had not been 
informed about this decision in advance." In concluding, the 
NBS statement points out that the Ministry of Finance itself is 
preparing monthly reports on the state budget fulfillment, which 
detail the development of individual items of budget revenues 
and expenditures.

<F P=106> ["Unauthorized" article by Jan Wawrzyniak on the news </F>
conference given by Major General Stanislaw Koziej of the 
National Security Bureau on 11 January in Wroclaw: "Let Us Not 
Fear Invasion"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, Major General Stanislaw Koziej of the 
National Security Bureau visited Wroclaw. His schedule 
included, among other things, a meeting with the command 
personnel of the Officers' Higher School of Mechanized Military 
Units in Czajkowskiego Street. General Koziej promoted his 
latest book entitled The Theory of the Military Art 
[Teoria sztuki wojennej]. After the meeting, he held a brief 
press conference, during which reporters fired a volley of 
questions at him. 
  [Question] Following the NATO summit in Brussels, certain 
circles in Poland have come to believe that the decisions made 
at the summit have reinforced the situation whereby we are kept 
in a certain state of vacuum, in military isolation. Are there 
reasons for us to be afraid? 
  [Koziej] The state of anxious concern is to a certain extent 
justified by our sense of finding ourselves in a "gray security 
zone." However, I would certainly be disinclined to dramatize 
this situation and to react to it nervously. From the viewpoint 
of Polish interests, the concept of "Partnership for Peace" 
defines the limits of what we can now realistically attain. 
However, we must not forget that, as a result of a concentrated 
diplomatic campaign conducted, among others, by President Lech 
Walesa and [Foreign] Minister Olechowski, the general formula 
for the partnership has acquired a tangible content. For 
example, we know that by following that path we will eventually 
come to NATO. I believe that much will still depend on our 
taking our own initiative. Poland should press for the signing 
of a specific agreement with NATO that would take into account 
the timetable of activities that can bring us closer to a 
rapprochement with the Atlantic Treaty. However, it must not be 
a register of wishful thinking on our part, but a cool political 
and economic calculation. 
  [Question] How would our rapprochement with NATO look from 
the purely military perspective? 
  [Koziej] The West has been putting out certain signals and 
directions. To begin with, it should involve participation by 
the Polish armed forces in joint exercises and maneuvers in 
order to achieve a degree of perfection in cooperation at 
headquarters level and in joint operations. In addition, our 
armed forces should take part in peace missions alongside NATO 
forces' soldiers. I believe that these are good ways of 
achieving mutual adjustment of our respective military 
structures. I will not deny that the greatest problem will be 
posed by our need to adjust to the high technology applied in 
NATO command, communications, and reconnaissance systems. On 
the other hand, we have nothing to be ashamed of when we compare 
the levels of theoretical and practical knowledge at the command 
of our officers' cadres, or the training of our soldiers. 
  [Question] But are we prepared for the possibility that, 
despite all the declarations and promises, the entrance door to 
NATO will, in the end, be slammed shut against us--in our faces, 
so to speak? 
  [Koziej] I do not share such fears. After all, certain 
changes and transformations are bound to take place even within 
the Atlantic Treaty itself. Even today, that structure is not 
altogether capable of coping successfully with all the tasks 
that the present day requirements place before it. I believe 
that, over the next few years, we will undergo an inevitable 
evolution of the entire system of European security. It is not 
outside the bounds of possibility that it will eventually become 
NATO's policy to accept all willing partners into the ranks of 
its self-reforming structure. 
  [Question] Including Russia and Ukraine? 
  [Koziej] Time will tell. Let me reiterate that, in my 
opinion, a joint security system will eventually evolve in 
Europe on the basis of NATO, and that the West will constitute 
its nucleus and its guarantor. 
  [Question] General, could Poland be threatened by a military 
conflict likely to develop in Central Europe? 
  [Koziej] We could be tempted into all manner of theoretical 
musings on that subject. For example, the Americans recently 
considered the possibility of a major invasion threatening 
Poland from the East and concluded that, in such an eventuality, 
we would be utterly defeated--a conclusion that is not 
particularly surprising when we consider the existing ratio of 
forces. Personally, I believe that we will not be seriously 
threatened with a direct and total military invasion from the 
East within a foreseeable future. I would rather perceive a 
real threat for Poland in the possibility of local conflicts 
erupting in the vicinity of our state borders--for example, if 
uncontrollable nationalistic feelings come to a head in 
Slovakia, Ukraine, or Russia. It would be relatively easy then 
for "offshoots" of those disturbances to penetrate our own 
territories. 
  [Question] What is the current military potential of our own 
250,000-strong armed forces? 
  [Koziej] We have at our disposal a military potential that 
currently permits us chiefly to carry out effective defense. 
Insofar as our capabilities allow, we will strive to adjust to 
the requirements of the contemporary universal military art, 
drawing on the theoretical achievements of both East and West 
European armies. With the passage of time, our armed forces 
should increasingly assume the character of combined 
air-and-surface formations in consideration of the potential at 
the disposal of our hypothetical adversaries. The rule that the 
stronger of the two adversaries dictates the rules of the game 
will always hold true. 
  [Question] Does this mean that certain changes in the Polish 
armed forces are inevitable? 
  [Koziej] It would be difficult to deny that they are 
inevitable. It is not inconceivable that the Polish defense 
system could demonstrate a certain inefficiency even before the 
end of this year. Consequently, political decisionmakers should 
look at the problems associated with the functioning of the Army 
not only in the perspective of just one term of office but also 
in a longer time scale. For quite a while now, President Walesa 
and the National Security Bureau have insisted that adequate 
levels of budget resources be allocated for defense. In my 
opinion, we should aim to have a small but 
extremely-well-trained and well-equipped Army in Poland. I 
believe that we should gradually convert to professional, career 
military service assisted by contract military service. Of 
course, reserve military training should still be preserved in 
addition to those two main forms of military service. An army 
that is composed predominantly of career servicemen need not be 
more expensive to run than one made up of drafted soldiers; one 
European example that proves this thesis is that of the British 
military service. 
  [Question] The alderman of Koscierzyna parish has offered to 
allocate 1 billion zlotys of his parish funds to benefit the 
National Defense Fund. Do you think that a nationwide 
collection, held in peacetime, for such a purpose is a good 
idea, or is it merely a case of a disproportionately emotive 
initiative that could only alarm our neighbors unduly? 
  [Koziej] I would assess that particular initiative in 
positive terms. At the same time, I believe that it is an 
expression of an understandable public concern over the Polish 
armed forces' material condition. Perhaps as a result of it 
politicians will now turn their attention more closely to the 
problem it highlights. To go back to your question, however, we 
could easily picture a situation where each voivodship would 
make a contribution toward the purchase of three modern tanks by 
the Army. Surely there would be nothing wrong in such a scheme? 
In any case, I believe that the extramilitary sector is the 
weakest link in our defense system. I am thinking here of the 
levels of knowledge and awareness of a whole range of defense 
issues prevalent among our population. There is, however, a 
marked improvement on that score among the voivodas, which was 
noticeable as early as last year. Nevertheless, there is still 
much scope for improvement in our central administration and 
within individual ministries.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Bozena Wawrzewska under the "Observations" </F>
rubric] 
  [Text] As the date for granting a license for the 
all-national television station is drawing closer, emotions are 
soaring higher and higher. All kinds of speculations are 
emerging; we can see people not really taking understandable 
measures related to the possibility of getting the future 
license. The council suggests mergers, even though people did 
not establish their companies to merge them with others. 
Reuter, for one, joined TV-7, and it is not at all certain 
whether it would like to merge with the Association of 
Entertainment Enterprises, for instance. At any rate, there is 
a lot of bustling activity around this issue. 
  However, even though private television has not started 
operating yet, certain behavior of the public television seems 
to be a little strange. Directly before airing the 
interrogation of the National Council of Radio and Television 
[KRRiT], our television showed the studio of one of the 
candidates--POLSAT. In a report on the KRRiT press conference, 
aired on the main "Panorama" newscast, there was the following 
statement: There are rumors that POLSAT has quite a big chance. 
Wieslaw Walendziak, president of the public television and 
former POLSAT director, at a meeting with students at the 
Journalism Center, in which he participated along with the 
present POLSAT Director Boguslaw Chrabota, expressed hope, as 
the SIS agency reports, that POLSAT would soon obtain the 
license for an all-national television. On the following day, 
he made the following statement exclusively for SIS: "There is 
no precise view as to who should obtain the license for an 
all-national television; however, I would not be very worried or 
surprised if one of the fundamental elements of commercial 
television were POLSAT television, where I worked for a year." 
  Anyone who has worked in television is aware of the power of 
this medium and of the various interests that cross with each 
other there. He also knows all the influences and 
interdependence in television. The state-run television as well 
as its previous managers were often accused--frequently not 
without cause--of yielding to political influence and pressures. 
Public television is supposed to be the guarantee of 
objectivity and impartiality. Therefore, I do not think it 
would be good if right at the beginning it made people think 
that political influence was replaced by other kinds of 
influence.

  [Text] Warsaw, 24 January--Poland will not allow into the 
country refugees from the former Yugoslavia, who may be sent 
back from Sweden and travel on transit through our country, 
unless the Swedes ensure in advance that they are in possession 
of Czech and Slovak transit visas, Jaroslaw Molga, spokesman for 
the Border Guard Main Headquarters said on 24 January. 
Polish-Swedish talks on this issue are in progress. 
  Last Friday [21 January], the Czechs and Slovaks prevented a 
group of 55 Albanians from crossing the border. They had to 
travel through Ukraine instead, Molga told a PAP journalist. 
  The Czech Republic has recently introduced visas for 
citizens 
from the former Yugoslavia, which has made the transit of 
refugees on the way back [from Sweden] complicated. 
  Leszek Czerwonka, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MSZ] 
border traffic department, told a PAP journalist that there was 
an agreement on this matter between Poland and Sweden. 
According to this agreement, Sweden can send back through our 
country those refugees who have failed to be granted refugee 
status and who arrived in Sweden during the period when that 
country did not have visa-authorized traffic with the former 
Yugoslavia, and who have been illegally extending their stay. 
These refugees are transported through Poland by the Swedes in 
coaches that are paid by them. In accordance with this 
agreement, such groups cross the border of the Polish Republic 
in Swinoujscie and in Chyzne and Cieszyn. [passage omitted 
including passage indistinct] 
  The MSZ Office for Immigration and Refugees said that 
citizens from the former Yugoslavia on their way back through 
Poland do not ask for political asylum in our country.

<F P=106> [Open letter from Slovak President Michal Kovac: "A Broader </F>
Coalition--The Path to Stability"] 
  [Text] We carried in NARODNA OBRODA the full text of an 
open letter from HZDS [Movement for a Democratic Slovakia] 
officials and deputies to the president of the Slovak Republic 
dated 8 January 1994. It raised objections to the idea 
expressed by the president in his New Year address of forming a 
broader coalition. Yesterday, a reply was delivered to our 
editorial office. We are publishing the letter in full: 
  "I have read your open letter of 8 January 1994. I respect 
your right to an opinion and to criticize the president's public 
addresses. Nevertheless, I believe that it would have been 
decent if you had asked me to answer your questions in a 
personal letter to me, rather than in an open one, or if you had 
invited me to a private meeting so that I could explain any 
misunderstanding before you took a public stand. 
  It is not customary for a president to answer open letters 
in 
the press. I have decided to take this course because of the 
particular significance of the problems that you presented in 
your letter. In the meantime, other voices have been raised on 
the same problems, accusing me of wanting to cast doubts on the 
position and work of the government. This is utter nonsense and 
the product of unfounded mistrust, which I must categorically 
reject. 
  You yourselves ask several questions that seem to blend into 
a single one: You ask me whether other parliamentary parties in 
addition to the HZDS and the SNS [Slovak National Party]--that 
is, parties that do not have any credit for the establishment of 
the Slovak Republic--should be represented in the coalition. 
Let me recount several basic facts. 
  The results of the elections in June 1992 facilitated the 
formation of a government purely on the basis of the program of 
the HZDS and the SNS. This government had the support in the 
Slovak parliament not only of 74 HZDS deputies but also of 15 
SNS deputies. Because of this and also because of the votes of 
some Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] deputies, it was 
possible for the Slovak parliament to adopt the Declaration of 
Sovereignty of Slovakia and to approve the Constitution of the 
Slovak Republic. 
  We did, however, need votes from other parties in the 
Federal 
Assembly to pass the Law on the Demise of the Federation and 
other related laws. We succeeded, as is well known, in obtaining 
votes from the Social Democratic Party of Slovakia [SDSS] and 
again from the SDL. Therefore it was possible to terminate the 
function of the federation by peaceful and constitutional means 
and start on 1 January 1993 on the road of independent state 
existence. The demise of the federation ended the first 
postelection phase, and the emergence of the independent Slovak 
Republic on 1 January 1993 started the second. In this second 
postelection phase, during which the silent coalition fell apart 
and eight deputies left the HZDS club, there are much more 
difficult and long-term tasks that require, among other things, 
the consolidation of all forces and their participation in 
carrying out historic tasks. There is no point in incessantly 
recalling who wanted or did not want what prior to the elections 
and during the first postelection phase. Instead, we must ask 
who and under what circumstances is ready and willing to 
participate in building the Slovak statehood and solving vitally 
important problems. We need to invite partners rather than 
produce adversaries. Such work requires peace, stability of 
government, a Slovak Partnership for Peace--that is, a 
partnership of all the significant political forces and trust 
and support from abroad. This could be achieved if the 
government were constantly supported by 80-90 deputies. Given 
the present coalition, we know that consistent support can be 
expected from 74-76 deputies. It is enough to continue with 
makeshift government solutions and improvisations that enable it 
to survive on a month-to-month basis. It is not enough, however, 
for us to seek in a peaceful atmosphere and with the maximum 
support of hundreds of thousands of people the conceptual and 
profound solutions to the problems of the economy and internal 
security and to receive sufficient trust and support from abroad. 
  I appealed in my New Year address for a peaceful and 
conceptual way and for stability of government, which requires 
the consistent support of at least 80-90 parliamentary deputies. 
  In this spirit, I spoke about the need to form a broader 
coalition government. That is why I am calling for such a 
government. It is my duty. The responsibility of the HZDS 
implies the movement's obligation to form such a government. It 
is the duty of not only the HZDS chairman or the HZDS leadership 
but of the entire HZDS to do everything in its power in the 
interest of finding a solution to the vitally important needs of 
our citizens, to create political stability in the country and 
accord among political and nonpolitical forces. 
  Its election victory granted the HZDS a single 
privilege--namely, the right to form a stable government and 
guarantee a peaceful atmosphere and the necessary support for 
its work in parliament and public administration. 
  Whether we like it or not, the exercising of this privilege 
puts an end to the differentiation between those who wanted an 
independent Slovak state and those who did not, those who voted 
for the Declaration of Sovereignty of the Slovak Republic and 
the Constitution of the Slovak Republic and those who did not, 
those who vociferously call for early elections and those who 
oppose them, those who support the government and those who 
criticize it and incessantly question its acts. According to 
our democratic Constitution, regardless of whether we are in the 
government coalition or the opposition, we are all equal, and 
that applies not only to deputies but to all citizens, 
regardless of whether they voted for the HZDS, the KDH [Slovak 
Christian Democratic Movement], the SDL, or Coexistence. To ask 
for other privileges in addition to this is undemocratic and 
anticonstitutional. 
  You ask who is to be in the coalition that I am postulating. 
Again, I can only give you a general answer, but I know that a 
coalition can only be formed with the help of those political 
entities present in parliament. Who will form it depends on 
whether the HZDS will aim for a broad coalition, with the 
support of at least 80 deputies, for instance, or a broader 
coalition, with the support of, say, at least 90 deputies. 
True, within the broad coalition, the election results would 
definitely have to be taken into account, both in the 
composition of the government and in its policy objectives. 
This would not mean in either instance--and with the 
parliamentary mechanism it is not even possible--a denial that 
the HZDS emerged from the elections as the strongest political 
force. If a broader coalition government is considered, then it 
is solely because such a situation transpires in parliament as 
to make it a necessity. While, at the beginning of 1993, it was 
possible to choose between a noncoalition and a coalition 
government, today a coalition, and it seems a broader coalition, 
government is unavoidable. 
  I again repeat that personal dislikes of people at the head 
of individual parties and movements must not stand in the way of 
the formation of a stable and operational government. 
  I would be glad if these words could convince you that, with 
my idea of the need for a broad coalition in my New Year 
address, I did not in the least intend to cast any doubts on the 
government. This is precisely the reason that I refer to a 
broader coalition government. I see in it a guarantee of a 
greater and more stable support in parliament and in the public. 
Only such a government can guarantee internal stability, raise 
the international credibility of our state, and contribute to 
the creation of a calm, human, and working atmosphere in our 
country. We can achieve this only if all of us consistently put 
the interests of Slovakia and its citizens above the interests 
of individual people, parties and movements, and other groups.

Toman in Bratislava on 21 January--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Toman] This week our country has been 
extraordinarily rich in visits of representatives of important 
international institutions. Experts from the Council of Europe, 
Miguel Martinez, the chairman of the Parliamentary Assembly of 
the Council of Europe, as well as Max van der Stoel, of the High 
Commission of the Conference for European Security and 
Co-operation [CSCE], were especially interested in changes in 
the territorial division of Slovakia as well as our reform of 
state administration and self-administration. Did more 
fundamental proposals come out of these meetings, Prime 
Minister, by which the government would correct its existing 
intentions in this area? 
  [Meciar] All three visits were important and each of them 
was 
different. The talks on territorial division, which were held at 
an expert level, in effect examined different variants of the 
proposals we had submitted and the objections that were 
envisioned to be raised by Hungarian political parties in the 
Council of Europe. I can say that the Slovak Government course 
was solidly based, and we shall submit all legislative proposals 
to the National Council by 30 June so that they can be approved. 
The territory of Slovakia will be divided on the basis as 
required by the administration of the given territory and not on 
an ethnical principle. 
  The second visit, which was connected with the president of 
the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Mr. 
Martinez, was significant in that we discussed rather global 
problems, global relations in Europe, and Slovakia came out very 
well, even more than very well out of that assessment. If the 
citizens could have heard what was said, this would have simply 
confused our criticics and those people who are engaged in 
propaganda against us, and they would have to creep back into 
their corner. Moreover, those talks provided an impetus for 
Slovakia to act in the pursuit of such relations in its own name 
and become substantially more active than before so that its 
voice could be heard substatially more loudly. It should cease 
to be the Czech Republic's twin and come out with its own 
independent proposals and initiative, which Europe needs. It 
also needs ideas from us because they are important and our 
perception of things, although different in some things, cannot 
be said to be bad because of this. 
  The visit of the Commissioner van der Stoel in essense 
reacted to the ongoing process of a two-year inspection both in 
Hungary and Slovakia regarding the minorities issues. One 
proposal that came out of it was that a consultative body should 
be set up at which minorities issues would be continually 
discussed. A proposal on collective rights, however, did not 
come out of it. The talks did not touch on that subject. 
  Therefore, all three visits were special in their own way. 
Each of them was positive in relation to Slovakia both in 
content and importance. [passage omitted] 
  [Toman] Already deliberations of parliamentary committees 
have shown that discussion about two amendment bills on big 
privatization, the government one and the one put forward by a 
group of deputies for the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], 
will be among the most interesting points on the agenda of a 
January session of the Slovak parliament. [passage omitted] 
  [Meciar] There is a diametrical difference between the SDL 
bill and the government bill. We do not intend to support the 
SDL bill becuase it is based on unrealistic assumptions. Above 
all, it is based on the assumption that there is strong capital 
market and a lot of money here--and the opposite is true. The 
National Bank of Slovakia does not intend to release those 20 
billion [presumably Slovak korunas] spoken about in the context 
of privatization in 1994. 
  Furthermore, the SDL bill does not take into account the 
fact 
that our territory is nationally mixed. Various nationalities 
live here, and various economic interests exist here. There is 
no longer any need to hide the fact that, according to the 
figures on privatization as of 30 June 1993, in the nationally 
mixed areas more than 50 percent of privatized assets were 
acquired by the Hungarian capital--almost the entire retail 
sphere, food industry, wholesale distribution. This is not good, 
and it can have political hidden meaning, too. This is why it is 
necessary to have also other entities present there. 
  If the system changes proposed by the SDL are carried out, 
this would result in two undesirable facts. First, privatization 
assets would be accumulated in hands of a narrow circle of 
people. Second, the present reorganization would be destroyed 
and we would need to begin anew. [passage omitted] 
  A compromise is possible because the SDL bill includes some 
rational elements of a technical nature that are acceptable to 
us. However, we got stuck in the last moment as the SDL demands 
the split of privatization minister post from the post of 
president of the Fund of National Property. [passage omitted] 
  [Toman] In this context, opposition officials like to list 
your present posts, ranging from the chairman of the presidium 
of the Fund of National Property to privatization minister and 
to the post of prime minister of the government. Mr. Prime 
Minister, is this accumulation of posts inevitable? Isn't an 
appointment of privatization minister about to be announced? 
  [Meciar] [passage omitted] The problem is not that I am 
currently holding the two posts. I am in fact putting things in 
order there. In substance, as moral and political authority was 
lacking to reveal the relations about the existence of which we 
were aware, I have found time to do this tidying up. It is now 
under way. [passage omitted] 
  As far as a new privatization minister is concerned, I have 
known his name for a long time, and an agreement on him was 
reached several months ago. So far I have not put forward his 
nomination to the president only because the SDL bill proposes, 
among other things, to abolish the Privatization Ministry. Once 
this issue is clarified by a law adopted by the parliament, I 
will immediately put forward my nomination for privatization 
minister. 
  I have never personally accumulated power. I accumulate 
responsibility, administrative duties, and I serve. It is 
totally alien to me to perceive my post as the post providing me 
with power. [passage omitted] 
  [Toman] A week ago, Interior Ministers Jan Ruml and Jozef 
Tuchyna announced that their recommendation regarding open 
questions concerning the Slovak-Czech border would be that the 
hamlet of (Sidonia) in the village of Horne Srnie become part of 
the Czech Republic and, on the other hand, the hamlet of U 
Sabotu in the Moravian village of Javornik nad Velickou become 
part of the Slovak village Vrbovce. [passage omitted] 
  [Meciar] As far as border changes are concerned, meetings of 
ministers are only consultations. I do not think we will manage 
to conclude the matter by the end of this year because the 
problem is more complicated inasmuch as it involves also the 
catchment area of the Morava river. [passage omitted] 
  A decision on this matter can be made only by the National 
Council. I would like to confirm once again the pledge I made in 
the past that not a single square centimeter of the Slovak 
territory will be given away without being compensated for by a 
square centimeter from the Czech side and without an agreement 
of legislative bodies. The government will stick to this 
principle, strictly respecting not only the local 
self-administrative bodies but also other matters. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by "dah": "Referendum Will Decide in Javornik; </F>
Tense Situation at Czech-Slovak Border"] 
  [Text] Javornik--There is tension and, to a certain 
extent, a very dangerous situation in the hamlet of "U Sabotu," 
which is part of the Moravian community of Javornik in Hodonin 
district, according to a number of local residents. The 
Javornik Community Council has therefore rejected the recent 
agreement between the Czech and Slovak interior ministers, under 
which the "U Sabotu" hamlet and the Javornik railway station 
(altogether 140 hectares of Czech territory and 37 houses) are 
to be ceded to the Slovak Republic. 
  As Javornik Mayor Martin Kruzica told SME, the situation is 
rather tense, in his opinion. He would not yet want to 
characterize the situation as dramatic [vyhrocena], although 
verbal assaults are not a rarity. Their main target are the 20 
locals who applied for Czech citizenship, thereby exposing 
themselves to ridicule from the Slovak side, especially in the 
local pub. The agreement reached by the interior ministers was 
based on a petition asking for the territory to be annexed to 
Slovakia. However, the petition was signed by only 46 of the 
126 residents of the hamlet. By means of a different petition, 
300 Javornik residents communicated to the Ministry of Interior 
and border commission the complete reverse position, however. 
  As Martin Kruzica told us, the Community Council is now 
studying the possibility and effectiveness of a referendum that 
would involve all 860 Javornik residents. If everything goes 
smoothly, the referendum could be held as early as next week. "I 
expect the outcome to be nearly 50-50, but more than one-half 
could in fact opt for annexation to Slovakia," the Javornik 
mayor added. 
  On the one hand, Martin Kruzica understands the problems of 
Slovak citizens who commute from the hamlet to Slovakia for work 
and school. The motives of the protests against surrendering 
the area to the Slovak Republic are, however, just as serious, 
in his opinion. Many private plots would find themselves on the 
territory of another state, which would complicate access for 
their owners. Overall, the border change would render impossible 
access to 45 hectares of meadows and 209 hectares of forests. A 
protest over a possible modification of the border has also been 
submitted by 150 Czech owners of land from Velka nad Velickou. 
According to Jiri Psurny, mayor of this community, their 
protest has been addressed to the Ministry of Interior of the 
Czech Republic, the Chamber of Deputies, President Vaclav Havel, 
and government representatives. Other problems that must not be 
neglected concern timber cutting and harvesting, for which the 
border would have to be crossed. The question of all kinds of 
fees and tax conditions would also inevitably arise in this 
context. 
  The Czech and Slovak interior ministers will recommend their 
solution to the governments, but it must be approved by the 
parliaments of both countries. "We have contacted deputies 
representing southern Moravia and would like to assert through 
them our present interests. The issue of small border traffic, 
in particular, should be resolved at long last. I am seriously 
worried that otherwise, the verbal clashes might evolve into 
something we do not want," the mayor of Javornik conceded in his 
interview for SME. "We have in our community written records 
that are 200 years old. The borders in these records are 
virtually identical to the present borders. There is no need to 
deal with the problem of the border, it is people's problems 
that require solutions."

Russian GAZPROM gas company, by Vladimir Duduc, in Bratislava on 
10 January: "Doubling of Deliveries; Preliminary Agreement on 
Gas Imports From Russia"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Duduc] We know that, while in 
Bratislava, you discussed natural gas deliveries to Slovakia. 
What are your conditions? 
  [Vyachirev] Our talks were concluded with the signing of a 
protocol that affirms the two sides' interest in advantageous 
bilateral cooperation. [passage omitted] The Russian Federation 
is interested in increasing natural gas deliveries to the 
countries of Western Europe via the Slovak Republic's transit 
gas pipeline system. Your side, on the other hand, is asking for 
more gas from Russia. We have agreed that experts of both 
countries meet in Bratislava or Moscow by the end of the first 
quarter of this year to specify the amount by which [Slovak] 
natural gas imports will be increased. According to preliminary 
agreements, the increase should be in the range of 4-5 billion 
cubic meters, which is approximately twice the amount the Slovak 
Republic has been importing thus far. 
  [Duduc] Have you also come to an agreement on prices? 
  [Vyachirev] No, we did not discuss prices. Even if we did, I 
would not reply to your question because it is a commercial 
secret. I would not tell anyone. 
  [Duduc] Did you also discuss the modernization of existing 
gas pipelines or the construction of new ones? 
  [Vyachirev] We have agreed on a fraternal division of labor. 
Everyone will do his job on his own territory--Russia on Russian 
territory and Slovakia on Slovak territory.

  [Excerpt] Much has been said this week about the suspension 
of Russian oil suppplies to our country. According to the latest 
reports from Moscow, everything is all right now. Ambassador to 
Russia Roman Paldan, with whom our permanent correspondent to 
Moscow talked this morning, has more details. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Smihula] I know that you 
held intensive talks this morning with the senior staff at 
relevant ministries and offices. A while ago you spoke on the 
telephone to (Valeriy Chernayev), president of the Russian 
company Neftetrans. Ambassador, what is the latest development? 
  [Paldan] The end result is that oil supplies to Slovakia 
will 
be resumed at 1200 hrs today. 
  [Smihula] Do you mean our time or Moscow time? 
  [Paldan] Moscow time. 
  [Smihula] This means then that Russian oil should have begun 
traveling toward our country when the lunchtime edition of 
Radiozurnal is on the air. 
  [Paldan] It is expected that the throughput of 27,000 tonnes 
in 24 hours will be achieved shortly. This is close to the 
normal throughput, I would say. Available at the present time 
are 150,000 tonnes of oil, for which documentation has been 
issued. Work on further quantities is going on in order to 
ensure a continuous flow and subsequently also continuous 
production in Slovnaft [Bratislava-based refinery working on 
Russian oil]. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Roman Hofbauer, minister of transport, </F>
communications, and public works, by Ivan Vaclavik; place and 
date not given: "Do We Need Radio Free Europe Until the 
Elections?"] 
  [Excerpts] Certain groups find the termination of the Radio 
Free Europe [RFE] broadcast on the AM band via the Slovak 
telecommunications transmitter a hard morsel to swallow. We 
asked Roman Hofbauer, minister of transport, communications, and 
public works, what led to this decision. [passage omitted] 
  [Vaclavik] Have some reasons arisen for abrogating the 
contract before 1995? 
  [Hofbauer] A lot has changed since 1990. The state 
guarantees political plurality, democracy, and freedom of 
expression. A dual broadcast is enshrined in Slovak law. That is 
something that even Austria and Hungary do not have. The 
configuration of the RFE broadcast has also fundamentally 
changed, and this was not approved by the participating partners 
in the contract. 
  [Vaclavik] What is the essence of the dual broadcast in 
Slovakia? 
  [Hofbauer] It is, among other things, projected in the great 
demand for private and commercial broadcasts. The wavelengths 
and broadcast frequencies of each state are very strictly and 
precisely regulated and coordinated by the so-called Geneva 
plan. Otherwise, chaos would fill the air. Therefore, each state 
protects its broadcast possibilities as part of its national 
wealth. Given these circumstances, it is surprising that 
Slovakia has not sufficiently covered its own territory by the 
Slovak radio signal. The chances of possibly receiving Slovak 
radio abroad, as we hear from our countrymen, are even worse. It 
is, to a large extent, a result of the Slovak radio transferring 
its broadcast to FM frequencies, the reception of which is 
diminished by the varied land surface. A good, statewide 
reception from our transmitters is possible, particularly on the 
AM band. On the 1287 kHz frequency, however, you will not 
receive the broadcast of a Slovak radio station but rather that 
of RFE. 
  [Vaclavik] In a recent interview with RFE Director Robert 
Gilett, a possible reduction of the RFE broadcast was discussed. 
Nevertheless, the station allegedly maintains the full extent of 
the broadcast. 
  [Hofbauer] No, it has substantially reduced the broadcast, 
which confirms that the political climate in Europe has changed. 
The original funding of $208 million has been reduced to 
one-third, and the staff is being reduced just as drastically, 
allegedly to one-half. [sentence as published] As part of the 
reduction, the section for broadcasts to the Czech Republic, 
Poland, and Hungary is closing, while the broadcasts for 
Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania are allegedly being maintained. 
The Slovak side cannot view this other than as a certain form of 
classification of European states, which, with respect to 
Slovakia, we can only denote as unfortunate. It is also 
necessary to assess the alleged claim of "maintaining the RFE 
Slovak broadcast until the early parliamentary elections...." 
The Slovak Republic Council for Radio and Television Broadcast 
is a better place to look for comments on the content and 
structure of the RFE Slovak broadcast. It is well informed 
regarding the completely biased depiction of Slovakia by people 
who failed in democratic elections. Of course, there is nothing 
to prevent Radio Free Europe from broadcasting for Slovakia, as 
long as it is done outside the Slovak territory and as long as 
they will finance it.

  [Text] Tirana, January 19 (ATA) -- Talks between 
representatives of the Albanian Ministry of Defence and those of 
the American delegation of the Defence Department, headed by 
U.S. assistant secretary, Crusel, started on January 18 in 
Tirana. The Albanian minister of defence, Safet Zhulali, 
expressed his pleasure for the first high raking American 
meeting about the field of defence. He conveyed to the U.S. 
delegation the greeting of the Albanian president and general 
commander of the Armed Forces of Albania, Mr. Sali Berisha. 
"This meeting is very important," Mr. Zhulali said, "for the 
fact that it is being held right after the NATO summit, in which 
the idea of Partnership for Peace was presented. This is 
brilliant idea," he said further on, "which we support 
unreservedly. We shall be totally committed to it, thus 
realising cooperation with all democratic countries, especially 
with the U.S.A. In this way, we will contribute to creation of 
the conditions for Albania to become a NATO member. 
  Mr. Zhulali said that Albania is playing an important role 
for the peace and stability in the Balkan region. "The latest 
message of President Clinton conveyed to us by Ms. Albright is 
encouraging and supports the bilateral cooperation between 
Albania and the U.S.A." 
  Mr. Josef Crusel said that he was pleased to be in Albania 
in 
the lead of a high ranking delegation. "Through the photos of 
former Secretary Baker during his visit to Albania we created 
the image for the overthrow of the dictatorship in Albania. 
This gives Albania a special place among us, Americans," Mr. 
Crusel said. "I hope that our discussions will be very 
productive regarding bilateral relations in the field of 
security," Mr. Crusel said.

  [Text] Sofia, January 22 (BTA) -- "This cabinet can set 
the reforms going only if it finds in itself the will to govern. 
A will to govern -- this is essential for Lyuben Berov's 
cabinet," President Zhelyu Zhelev said in an interview aired in 
tonight's Panorama political roundup on national television. 
Berov's cabinet was elected in late 1992 on the mandate of the 
Movement for Rights and Freedoms. It was voted in by the 
Bulgarian Socialist Party and the New Union for Democracy. 
  The cabinet should learn to put its foot down and deliver 
what it promised to do, reckoning with no political force or 
group, Mr. Zhelev stressed, adding that the same applied, to an 
even higher degree, to crime control. According to him, "all 
kinds of considerations and compromises inevitably erode the 
cabinet and its potential as the executive branch." "Leaning on 
the law, the cabinet must show it can run the country and break 
the neck of organized crime," President Zhelev said. According 
to him, then the cabinet "will be respected and supported both 
by parliament and the judiciary, and there will be fewer 
attempts to pull its strings." 
  Asked whether this statement is supposed to mean that the 
cabinet has shown no will to govern so far, the president said: 
"Indeed the cabinet has not shown the will to govern which is 
much needed in the circumstances. The cabinet reckoned with too 
many things in the past year." That is why, Mr. Zhelev said, 
the cabinet scored no success in privatization, and the land 
reform, though it reached a certain point, left much to be 
desired. 
  Asked who should take responsibility for bailing the country 
out of the crisis, President Zhelev said: "The government, 
first and foremost." "I believe the executive is the fuse which 
is the first to blow under tension, being directly responsible 
for the country's development, followed, of course, by 
parliament, which elects and supports that cabinet," the 
president added.

  [Text] Sofia, January 20 (BTA) -- As the factual and legal 
aspects of the incident in the Belite Brezi Sofia Borough (last 
Friday night [14 January] riot police members shot down two 
commandos of the counter-terrorist squad and wounded one in an 
unauthorized operation) are very complicated, the investigation 
is taken over by a specialized department of the National 
Investigative Service (NIS), today's press release of the NIS 
says. So far the investigation has been in the hands of eight 
investigators of the Sofia Investigative Service and the NIS 
deputy chief who conducted all the necessary preliminary 
investigative proceedings. The persons directly involved in the 
incident, as well as senior police officers were interrogated. 
The weapons seized, including the armament found near the scene 
of the incident, were submitted for expert analysis, the press 
release says. In the meantime some of the witnesses have 
disclosed certain facts and circumstances which are being 
investigated through the press. Such statements are unwelcome, 
the NIS says in its release adding that it will make its 
findings public when the criminal proceedings are completed. 
  As mass media reporters have been increasingly pressing 
senior officials and employees of the Sofia Directorate of the 
Interior for interviews in connection with the Belite Brezi 
incident, the Directorate has got to warn them that its 
employees will refrain from any public statements, the Sofia 
Directorate of the Interior points out in a press release today. 
It is stressed that the investigation and the disciplinary 
proceedings launched have not been completed yet.

  [Excerpt] Sofia, January 20 (BTA) -- At a private meeting 
today, the cabinet considered and adopted the main provisions of 
the Russian Government's December 1993 proposal on settlement of 
the Russian debts to Bulgaria which had accrued since the 
termination of payments in transferable rubles in 1990 and as a 
result of the 1991 clearing trade agreement. "This is the first 
major step towards settling the matter. By this proposal, 
Russia admits in principle its obligations, offering a specific 
scheme for their payment," Deputy Prime Minister Valentin 
Karabashev said after the meeting. 
  The Russians offer a translation of the transferable rubles 
balance into U.S. dollars using a definite factor and payment 
over five years after a five-year grace period, and rescheduling 
of debts denominated in the clearing equivalent of the U.S. 
dollar. The cabinet accepted all these proposals in principle 
but mandated Mr. Karabashev to insist on an immediate start of 
payments on the transferable ruble debt even if it would have to 
be rescheduled over a longer period. These arrangements do not 
involve the Bulgarian hard-currency debts to Russian banks, as 
they are subject to the negotiations with Bulgaria's London Club 
creditors, Mr. Karabashev specified. He hopes the negotiations 
with the Russians will start as soon as possible but the exact 
date has yet to be set. Mr. Karabashev said that the debts in 
question amount to about 670 million transferable rubles and 
$500 million U.S. (in clearing equivalent). Still, these are 
not the final figures as some Bulgarian debts to Russia in 
national currencies are yet to be deducted from these amounts 
and the balances will be translated using a factor which has to 
be negotiated. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sofia, January 19 (BTA) -- French President 
Francois Mitterrand, who is on an official visit here, delivered 
a nearly two-hour address at the Bulgarian Parliament. "Who 
could think five years ago that in 1994 I would speak in front 
of a Bulgarian Parliament elected by democratic means, but even 
then one could feel the first signs of the coming change," 
President Mitterrand said, recalling his previous visit to this 
country in January 1989, several months before the downfall of 
the communist regime. The French president came to Bulgaria on 
condition that he would meet dissidents. He stressed that he 
has good memories from this country, from his meetings with 
Bulgarian students whose courage he then admired. Often Mr. 
Mitterrand's address was interrupted by applause. 
  "I want to express my admiration and respect for how much 
you 
have accomplished in such short terms, because you had to build 
a new society, starting from nothing," the French guest said. 
He stressed on his respect for the Bulgarian Parliament several 
times. Mr. Mitterrand spoke in general terms, giving also his 
personal evaluation, about the democratic values, freedom and 
the hardships accompanying an economic reform. 
  The French president stressed that Bulgaria will be the 
first 
East European country to preside over the Council of Europe's 
Committee of Ministers. "Believe me, both Bulgaria and Europe 
have made a progress," he said. The speaker went on to say that 
France is most supportive of a speedy ratification of a number 
of accords Central and East European states have signed with the 
European Union (EU). He said that France may be expected to 
ratify the agreement on Bulgaria's association with the EU by 
the end of April. Mr. Mitterrand pledged to insist that this 
issue be settled in the first days of the French Parliament's 
session. These words were met with loud applause. The French 
president evaluated in highly positive terms this country's 
desire to join the European states. "Europe belongs to you as 
much as it belongs to us," Mr. Mitterrand said. He said that 
Bulgaria has already found decisions to unsolvable problems and 
went on to cite as an example the peaceful co-existence of 
Bulgarians with the Turkish-speaking community here. "The 
Balkan Peninsula will probably hold you up as a model," the 
French president stressed, adding that Bulgaria could have a 
positive influence on the other Balkan countries. He praised 
highly Bulgaria's stand on the Yugo-conflict and the strict 
observation of the UN sanctions which costed this country a lot. 
"You lost profits but win international recognition and 
Europe's respect," he said. 
  "Any European country which sees a threat should rely on the 
solidarity of the other democratic states," President Mitterrand 
said, commenting on the Partnership for Peace plan. According 
to him, it is unthinkable that Bulgaria could face any threat 
and not have the support of the other democratic countries. Mr. 
Mitterrand said that France had tabled a European security pact 
to be put to discussion in Paris this April. He expressed his 
hope that this conference would turn into a new forum, which 
Bulgaria will choose to join. The speaker also expounded his 
idea for an European confederation. 
  The French president traced back in history the roots of the 
Bulgarian-French relations and commented on their future. He 
concluded his address expressing the hope that Bulgarian 
President Zhelev will pay an official visit to France sometime 
soon. 
  Introducing French President Mitterrand to the Bulgarian 
MP's, National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov said that 
they themselves could see how far Bulgaria had reached along the 
road of deep democratic changes. During his visit at the 
Bulgarian Parliament, Mr. Mitterrand was accompanied by his wife 
Danielle Mitterrand. Bulgarian President Zhelev, Prime Minister 
Berov and ministers were also present to hear President 
Mitterrand's address. 
  Since 1990, the Bulgarian Parliament have been addressed by 
Israeli President Chaim Herzog (June 1991), King Juan Carlos II 
of Spain (May 1993) and Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro 
(July 1993).

  [Text] Prague, Jan 23 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign Minister 
Josef Zieleniec said today that no timetable had been set for 
the Partnership for Peace plan because admission of new members 
into NATO could be accelerated if security situation worsened. 
Speaking in a Czech Television's discussion program, Arena, 
Zieleniec said that the Czech Republic's entrance into NATO 
would depend on the development of the security situation in 
Europe. 
  "If the developments are calm, peaceful, and heading for 
democracy in all Eastern and Central European states, ... the 
Czech Republic's admission into NATO may be protracted, but this 
will pose no risk to our security," Zieleniec said. He added 
that he did not think the country would now be facing any urgent 
threat. 
  Zieleniec said it was in the Czech Republic's interest that 
the neighbor countries belong to the same political-military 
bloc. "No one wants its own border to be the border of 
confrontation," he said. He dismissed as false all press 
considerations about the Czech Republic's wish to join NATO 
before its neighbors. But Zieleniec said that the North 
Atlantic Alliance, which jointly guarantees a bigger entity, had 
to be effective. The immediate opening of NATO deep eastwards 
and embracing states where democracy "is not yet fully 
convincing" would be risky.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 24 (CTK) -- Poland does not want to 
stage races for admission into NATO, Polish Defense Minister 
Piotr Kolodziejczyk told journalists after his meeting with his 
Czech counterpart Antonin Baudys today. 
  Kolodziejczyk, who arrived for a two-day visit to the Czech 
Republic today, said that not only the rapid integration of the 
Czech Republic and Poland into NATO was at stake, but also the 
admission of other countries because security is indivisible and 
Europe will be secure only when the islands of insecurity are 
eliminated. If most media write that the Polish voice has 
sounded louder in the talks about admission, this is caused by 
the fact that Poland feels threatened on its eastern border, 
Kolodziejczyk said. In the states east of Poland there is an 
unstable situation, he added. 
  Poland was not imposing any conditions for the adoption of 
the American Partnership For Peace, although there were certain 
pressures, for the initiative to include criteria for admission 
into NATO, Kolodziejczyk said. Both the Polish government and 
the president are currently assessing the partnership as 
positive, Kolodziejczyk stated. The Czech and Polish armies 
will conduct a total of 54 exchange and other joint projects, 
Kolodziejczyk announced. 
  In 1991 the two countries' defense ministries concluded a 
bilateral agreement on the main aims of cooperation in the 
military sphere. We have confirmed that although the original 
agreement was concluded under the former Czechoslovak 
federation, both countries consider it valid, Baudys said. At 
the same time, the two ministers have agreed that it was 
necessary to conclude a new agreement on mutual cooperation 
which would involve some points from the partnership for peace, 
Baudys announced. 
  The agreement would include possible cooperation in 
supplying 
and manufacturing spare parts for military equipment, in the 
arms industry, in particular the aviation industry, and training 
and joint exercises to which the two countries want to invite 
NATO representatives, Baudys said. 
  Kolodziejczyk was received by Foreign Minister Josef 
Zieleniec and Chairman of parliament Milan Uhde.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 22 (CTK) -- Czech Prime Minister Vaclav 
Klaus says in today's issue of LIDOVE NOVINY that "We do not 
need the Culture Ministry in the long run," but until at least 
the next parliamentary elections in 1966 it will have to be 
preserved. He says that other ministries have far more work to 
do and that the Culture Ministry's duties could be performed by 
a department attached to a government body. 
  "A whole ministry cannot occupy itself with the couple of 
things, such as monuments, the National Museum or the National 
Library," Klaus says. Asked to react to a recent statement by 
an unnamed Polish economist that he does not understand the 
Czech economy because low unemployment, no bankruptcies, and a 
relative prosperity are not phenomena that go together, Klaus 
says: "Somebody has erroneously coined the idea that 
bankruptcies have curative effects, that they are desirable, and 
that the success of economic transformation is in proportion to 
the number of bankruptcies," Klaus says. 
  "But there are many forms of restructuring enterprises and 
the bankruptcy is an extreme method. The first form is the 
company's getting back on its feet. A number of internal 
measures are carried out which turn the company, retaining its 
old name, into an entirely new one. The other thing is the 
process of privatization which has led to marked changes in the 
structure of many companies. Hundreds of enterprises have been 
intentionally liquidated and no one is surprised. Everyone 
would like to hear the word bankruptcy. But the more successful 
the other ways of restructuring are, the less bankruptcies can 
occur," Klaus stresses. He also dismisses the 
environmentalists' assertion that the large amount of raw 
materials in Czech exports is not a positive phenomenon in the 
long run. 
  "This is an entirely erroneous way of thinking influenced a 
little by the mercantilist idea or by the idea of early 
industrialization stages. Naturally, these considerations also 
contain the vision of socialist industrialization which our 
environmentalists have not yet mentally overcome. This idea is 
based on the tenet that a healthy economic development is 
connected with the manufacturing industry, and within it with 
the so-called modern, effective sectors. 
  "But foreign trade is based on nothing but on the idea of 
comparative advantage as coined by David Ricardo in 1817. ...If 
I have comparative advantage in the production of microchips, 
then I will export microchips. If I have comparative advantage 
in the production of kaolin tiles, I have to export kaolin tiles 
even though they have a greater content of raw materials than 
microchips. This is the elementary truth and it is just this 
argument -- export of raw materials -- which is used as an 
argument against free market," Klaus stresses in conclusion.

  [Text] Javornik, south Moravia Jan 19 (CTK) -- The 
situation is tense and dangerous in the village of U Sabotu 
after the interior ministers of the Czech Republic and Slovakia 
announced that they would recommend their governments to 
transfer 140 hectares of Czech territory and 37 houses to 
Slovakia, some local people told CTK today. A total of 126 
people live in the village. Some of them have sent two 
petitions asking the governments to allow the village to join 
Slovakia. "The first blow was dealt to a Slovak who accepted 
Czech citizenship, which the other side did not like. A smashed 
window and a destroyed new railway waiting room in Javornik are 
also nothing usual here," the mayor of the village said. 
  Representatives of the local Civic Democratic Party (ODS) 
from the neighboring village of Velka nad Velickou handed over a 
protest against the transfer of the Czech territory. "It cannot 
be determined by the petitions how many Slovaks really want to 
join Slovakia. Some signatures can be questioned. We have 
owned some properties there since 19th century," an ODS official 
said.

  [Text] Jachymov, west Bohemia, Jan 22 (CTK) -- The Civic 
Democratic Party [ODS] is convinced that the passage of a law 
defining the general rules to guide the restitution of church 
property could be considered, ODS Deputy Chairman Jan Strasky 
told journalists today. Speaking after a session of the ODS 
Executive Council, he said that the party stuck to its stand 
that the state was the entity to return property to the 
churches, and that the former church property, now possessed by 
communities, would be returned only with their approval. The 
church property was expropriated after the communists seized 
power in Czechoslovakia in February 1948. 
  Strasky said that particularly the buildings, which serve 
religious purposes and which are necessary to ensure the 
churches' existence, would be returned. Another criterion will 
be the cost of the consequences of property restitution, he 
added. The Executive Council has defined items to be returned 
according to the type, exclusively or enumeratively, and of 
items that will not be returned at all, Strasky said. He noted 
that the ODS has partially changed its previous stand and 
decided that also certain parts of farming and forest land and 
buildings related to them would be returned exceptionally and 
exclusively to religious orders. 
  The council also confirmed its previous stand that the 
property which would not be returned be handled as any other 
property, Strasky said. The council charged Strasky to defend 
in future negotiations on church property its negative stands on 
further restitutions and further proposals to alleviate property 
injustices. 
  The three other government coalition parties -- the 
Christian 
Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL), the 
Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) and the Christian Democratic 
Party (KDS) favor either comprehensive or almost comprehensive 
restitution of church property. The council also supported 
partial remedy of the wrongdoings caused to Czechs during the 
Nazi occupation for political or racial reasons and will soon 
initiate "advance, compensation from Czech resources, Prime 
Minister and ODS Chairman Vaclav Klaus said. He added this move 
was motivated by humanitarian points of view. "This does not and 
cannot mean in any case that we are abandoning our claims to 
Germany," he stressed. 
  The idea to compensate the Nazi victims from Czech resources 
was first formulated by Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec 
last year. It takes into consideration the high age of the 
eligible persons, but counts on continuing negotiations with the 
Germans on funding the compensation. The compensation concerns 
about 13,000 people.

  [Text] Jachymov, west Bohemia, Jan 22 (CTK) -- The 
Executive Council of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) believes 
that a bill on partial remedying the property injustices caused 
to Jewish communities does not have to be discussed together 
with a bill on church property restitution as proposed by some 
other parties, Petr Cermak said tonight. Cermak, ODS executive 
deputy chairman, said "the ODS is convinced that the issue could 
be solved relatively quickly." 
  ODS Chairman and Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said that the 
council had not discussed the restitution of gentry's property, 
but would deal with it later. He added that the party would not 
like all property relations in the Czech Republic to be 
complicated due to pure legislation. 
  Some 200 restitution claims have been made by the gentry, 
including 75 cases which reportedly fall under the Benes 
decrees. The decrees of 1945 provided for the expropriation of 
Germans, Hungarians, and other collaborators with the Nazis. 
  ODS Deputy Chairman Jiri Vlach said that the ODS staff in 
charge of the local elections, slated for the autumn, had 
convoked a meeting of all regions' representatives in Nymburk, 
central Bohemia, on January 31."

restitution resolved as soon as possible, adding he was slightly 
nervous about the protracted negotiations on it. In his regular 
radio program "Talks From Lany," he said all the discussions

sometimes "humiliating." He added he was convinced that the

for the rectification of the wrongs done to "our Jewish 
fellow-citizens." The issue of restitutions concerns churches, 
Jewish communities and most lately also the gentry. [passage

  [Text] Prague, Jan 18 (CTK) -- If parliamentary elections 
were held today, the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) would win with 
32 percent of the vote, according to an opinion poll carried out 
among 1,561 respondents over age 18 by the Center for Empirical 
Research (STEM) at the beginning of January. In second place, 
according to the research, would be the Civic Democratic 
Alliance (ODA) with 14 percent of the vote. The Czech Social 
Democratic Party (CSSD) would gain 13 percent, the Communist 
Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM) 9 percent and the Christian 
Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL) 6 percent. 
  Those parties winning less than 5 percent of the vote -- the 
cutoff for parliamentary representation -- would be the radical 
right-wing Assembly for the Republic-Czechoslovak Republican 
Party (SPR-RSC) with 4 percent, the Free Democrats (SD -- 
formerly the Civic Movement) with 2.5 percent, the 
Moravian-Silesian Centrist Party (MSS -- formerly the Movement 
for Self-Governing Democracy for Moravia and Silesia) with 2 
percent, and the Greens and the Christian Democratic Party (KDS) 
with 1.5 percent each. 
  The four parties making up the current governing coalition 
are the ODS, the ODA, the KDU-CSL, and the KDS. 
  The research indicated that 63 percent of eligible voters 
would take part in the elections, while 14 percent would 
definitely not vote and 23 percent are still undecided. The 
ODS, the KDU-CSL, and the KSCM show the greatest stability of 
voter preference. The CSSD has experienced a drop in 
popularity, while the ODA has gained favor among voters. 
Supporters of the ODS are the most strongly convinced of their 
preference, and 83 percent would vote in elections.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 21 (CTK) -- The General Agreement for 
1994 between the government, employers, and trade unions 
(tripartite) was signed this morning. The agreement was signed 
by Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Kocarnik (chairman of the 
tripartite), Vaclav Vanek, deputy chairman of the Czech and 
Moravian Chamber of Trade Unions (CMKOS), Jan Fencl, 
representative of employers, and Antonin Foldyna, chairman of 
the Confederation of Arts and Culture. Kocarnik called the 
General Agreement balanced and a good basis for further work of 
the tripartite. He said that it slightly differed from that 
signed for last year which was caused by a certain shift of the 
tripartite towards general activities. The essential aims of 
the agreement remained preserved, Kocarnik stated. 
  The agreement aims at preserving social peace in the period 
of transition from the central-command economy to a market 
system. Vanek said that no agreement can substitute for the 
will to observe it. He noted that the current general agreement 
was the fourth signed since the fall of the communist regime in 
Czechoslovakia in late 1989. Fencl said the signing of the 
agreement sealed the fact that all the three partners would stay 
behind the negotiating table in 1994 and would jointly search 
for settling problems in the economic and social spheres. 
  The signing was preceded by a series of talks. The Thursday 
talks resolved the last disputed point which concerned the 
extension of the collective agreements of higher degree. It was 
established that these agreements would be discussed by the 
tripartite commission to which the trade unions and employees 
would be able to turn. All the three parties to the general 
agreement confirmed that the employers' possible disagreement 
with the extension of the agreement would not be sufficient to 
prevent it from being extended.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 24 (CTK) -- Differing views on the use 
of nuclear energy will not prevent cooperation and good 
relations between Austria and the Czech Republic, Trade and 
Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy said today. He said that 
during his talks with Environment Minister Maria Rauch-Kallat in 
Vienna last Thursday [20 January], Austria's stand was partially 
changed and Austria now respected the principle of 
non-interference in the internal affairs of the Czech Republic, 
including decisions by the Czech Government. It is therefore 
possible to complete the construction of two blocks of the south 
Bohemian nuclear power plant at Temelin, some 100 kilometers 
from the Austrian border, Dlouhy said. 
  The issue of the construction of a temporary storage 
facility 
for nuclear waste in Dukovany, south Moravia, was also 
negotiated. The Czech side feels that Austrian opinions should 
be presented only on the basis of international agreements while 
the Czech Republic proposes meetings to be held between experts 
from both countries, Dlouhy said.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 20 (CTK) -- Eight parliamentarians from 
the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM) and one 
independent deputy, until now members of the Left Bloc (LB) 
deputies' group, founded a new group after they failed on 
Wednesday [19 January] to assert a change in the LB group's 
name, Vaclav Exner told CTK today. Exner, the KSCM deputy 
chairman, heads the new group. 
  The nine deputies left Wednesday's session of the LB group 
before a vote was taken on the proposal to change the group's 
name. Eventually, the remaining deputies decided to retain the 
name Left Bloc, but it will be followed with the abbreviations 
of the names of the three parties comprising it, listed in 
brackets. The three parties are the Left Bloc Party (SLB), the 
KSCM and the Democratic Left Party (SDL). 
  Originally the Left Bloc group consisted of the KSCM, the 
Democratic Left, and several smaller entities. On the basis of 
the June 1992 election results, the LB got 35 out of the total 
of 200 parliamentary seats and formed the second strongest group 
in the parliament. 
  The original number of nine parliamentary groups has 
increased to 11 due to various changes affecting non-government 
party groups.

  [Text] Budapest, 21 January (MTI) -- Yesterday the 
Hungarian Government adopted a plan of action for the remainder 
of its term, during which it envisages submitting 31 proposals 
to Parliament, State Secretary at the Prime Minister's Office, 
Jozsef Kajdi, told the press on Friday [21 January]. Kajdi said 
the plan sets the deadlines for tasks included in the government 
program adopted on December 21, 1993, such as the introduction 
of bills on land auction and bank consolidation. It also 
defines officials in charge of these tasks. 
  "The cabinet plans to submit six amendments and 25 new bills 
to Parliament," Kajdi said. He pointed out that 30 bills 
submitted by the government are already awaiting parliamentary 
decision. At its February 3 session, the cabinet is expected to 
determine the priority of the bills and suggest to Parliament a 
hierarchy for consideration. Kajdi added that the plan of 
action focuses on economic bills and those discussed during this 
week's consultations between the prime minister and 
parliamentary party leaders. 
  The government wants to work at full force up to the last 
moment of its term, and it has a full legal and political 
mandate for this course of action, Kajdi said. The term of the 
present Parliament extends to May 2, 1994, while that of the 
government extends to the opening session of the newly-elected 
Parliament, he added. Kajdi also said that the government has 
various ideas about methods for accelerating legislation. One 
already established practice is to hold inter-party 
consultations on the bills before Parliament's plenary 
discussions, he noted.

  [Text] Budapest, 19 January (MTI) -- Hungarian Prime 
Minister Peter Boross today assessed his talks with leaders of 
the biggest parliamentary parties and the chairman of the 
National Democratic Federation (NDSZ) over the past three days. 
Meeting with a small group of reporters, Boross recalled the 
promise he made just after the elections: That he would consult 
with the political parties which have appropriate political 
weight. 
  Giving the reasons for his meeting with the NDSZ chairman, 
Boross said that although Imre Pozsgay voiced opposition in the 
parliamentary debate over the foundation of the new cabinet, he 
kept the country's stability in view and thus accepted the new 
prime minister and the program of his cabinet. Boross said he 
had not intended to hold discussions with every party 
represented in Parliament, but, if need be, he would consider 
their opinions. 
  The prime minister informed his negotiating partners that 
early last week, in the Prague summit between the Visegrad four 
and U.S. President Bill Clinton, he mentioned Hungary's 
difficulties with regard to the UN embargo on Yugoslavia. He 
said the embargo had so far caused an almost unbearable damage 
of $1.3 billion to Hungary. The prime minister stressed that 
although Hungary would continue to observe the embargo, those 
concerned should in any case take steps to counterbalance its 
losses. It was emphasized in the talks that Hungary was pinning 
great hopes upon the conference on East European economies which 
was announced by President Clinton. 
  The various sides discussed how soon before the elections 
Parliament should suspend its operation. The prime minister 
said he feels that Parliament should operate until mid-April. 
Although there is no deadline for passing any law, parliament 
needs to approve about 10 important bills, including those on 
land, police, and the export-import bank, he said. 
  Boross confirmed that the government will submit a media 
bill 
to Parliament on February 7 at the latest. After that, the 
government will be prepared to coordinate with all parliamentary 
parties. He stressed that he would not propose any personnel 
changes in the management of Hungarian Radio and Television 
before the elections. The prime minister rejected opposition 
party leaders' recommendation that the government should not 
pass resolutions with long-term effects before the elections. 
"The cabinet is functioning without restraining itself because 
it has a full mandate. Nevertheless, we consider it our duty to 
inform the major parliamentary parties on long-term economic 
commitments," Boross said. 
  The prime minister said he would inform the president of the 
republic in a letter about proposals for the date of the 
elections. "Under the Constitution, it falls upon the president 
to decide on the date," Boross said.

  [Text] Budapest, 20 January (MTI) -- The activity of the 
World National Popular Rule Party, an extreme-right group under 
the banner of World War II Hungarian fascist leaders, is 
unacceptable and beyond contempt for the government, said 
spokeswoman Judit Juhasz in a statement carried by the daily 
NEPSZABADSAG on Thursday. Juhasz spoke to the daily after the 
party, registered in October 1993, held a meeting on Tuesday of 
about 50 people. At the meeting, the party claimed to succeed 
the Hungarian fascist arrow-cross party of the 1930's and 
1940's, and denied the Holocaust ever took place. 
  The new group reportedly wants to rehabilitate arrow-cross 
leader Ferenc Szalasi, who unleashed a reign of terror when his 
party came to power in 1944. He was executed in 1946 for crimes 
against humanity. 
  Juhasz regretted that Registration Court party synopses 
often 
differ from actual intentions. "The real motives and aims of 
these parties become clear only at their meetings and in their 
public statements." The Tuesday meeting makes this group 
unacceptable for the government and it violates constitutional 
order, Juhasz said. Asked by NEPSZABADSAG, she said the 
government feels constitutionally obliged to act against all 
forms of discrimination. At the commemoration of the liberation 
of the Budapest ghetto on Tuesday, the cabinet was represented 
by three ministers, signalling the government's clear position, 
Juhasz said.

  [Text] Washington, Jan. 24 -- Foreign Minister Andrzej 
Olechowski met Deputy Secretary of State designate Strobe 
Talbott in Washington on Monday [24 January] for talks lasting 
45 minutes. After the meeting Olechowski said that Poland would 
be the first country of Central and Eastern Europe to be visited 
by a western delegation of technical experts in order to prepare 
the ground for Polands participation in NATOs "Partnership for 
Peace" programme for cooperation with those countries. 
Olechowski said the mission would probably arrive in Poland 
next week. Olechowski had arrived in Washington on Sunday 
evening to hold a series of talks with representatives of the 
Clinton administration and congressmen on Monday and Tuesday. 
  Meeting with U.S. politicians, Olechowski is expected to 
discuss such key issues as Poland's participation in the 
"Partnership for Peace" programme, security and Polish-U.S. 
bilateral relations. From Washington Olechowski is scheduled to 
go on a tour of four U.S. cities to meet with businessmen whom 
he will try to encourage to do business with Polish partners.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 23 -- The Finance Ministry has prepared 
a draft law which will provide for the control of pay rises 
after the excess wage tax is revoked, Prime Minister Waldemar 
Pawlak told the "Linia Specjalna" TV programme Sunday [23 
January]. The prime minister is not afraid that when the excess 
wage tax is revoked in the second half of 1994, inflation and 
unemployment rate will grow. According to Pawlak, the prepared 
mechanisms will help link the pays with enterprises' incomes and 
inflation will be combatted by collective agreements on pay 
rises between employers and employees. The PM did not disclose 
the details of the law which is scheduled to be passed by the 
end of March. 
  Pawlak announced that the problem of reprivatization will be 
solved in 1994. The passing of the reprivatization law might be 
accelerated by the government submitting a reprivatization bill 
to the Sejm as a matter of urgency. 
  Replying to a charge that official prices have been 
increased, the PM said that the "Wiadomosci" TV news bulletin 
consistently presented the matter from one side only and 
recalled that from January 1 the lowest old age and disability 
pensions were increased and price rises were lower than 
envisaged in the budget assumptions from August 1993.

  [Text] Wroclaw, Jan. 25 -- Head of the Sejm Committee for 
National Defence Jerzy Szmajdzinski said that the condition of 
Polish Army's equipment is so poor that the Army will soon "run 
into cannibalism" by eating up its own reserves. Addressing a 
press conference in Wroclaw on Tuesday, Szmajdzinski warned that 
the daily costs of maintaining the complex military training, 
health care, and housing systems represent 75 percent of the 
total Army budget because these structures are too large for the 
reduced Polish Army. Szmajdzinski called for respective quick 
decisions because even a 6-7 percent increase in spending on 
national defence will not solve the problem. He also appealed 
for quicker structural changes in the national defence sector 
and exemption of 5 thousand soldiers from the military service 
duty.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 20/1/1994 -- President Ion 
Iliescu stressed in an interview with the government daily VOCEA 
ROMANIEI the necessity of continuing the dialogue with the 
representatives of the political parties as well as of talks to 
be started among parties, between parties and trade unions, and 
between the government and the trade unions, so as to single out 
a platform of national interest, a program for Romania's 
development for the beginning of the 21st century. 
  The president termed his meetings with political leaders as 
"a first touch (...) that will have to be furthered. Likewise, 
the direct inter-party dialogue should continue. Which is what 
I have suggested. And so said also the representatives of the 
Democratic Convention of Romania" (the group of opposition 
parties.) 
  "To the extent to which a political pact or at least an 
understanding among parties will or will not come to the fore," 
President Iliescu went on, "it seems to me that the next step to 
be taken is to extend the dialogue at a parties--trade unions 
and government-trade unions level. I have been always ready for 
direct talks with the representatives of the big trade union 
federations, in order to secure a framework of partnership for 
the dialogue among these political forces, trade unions, 
government, administration, and employers." 
  Of the major targets of the envisaged wide-scale dialogue, 
Ion Iliescu mentioned the establishment of the contact points 
for the establishment of a platform of national interest and the 
sketching of a perspective program, of a social-economic 
development strategy for Romania with the beginning of the 21st 
century in sight. "We have to look ahead, so as to open the 
prospect for Romania's integration in the processes 
characteristic of the world economic development," President Ion 
Iliescu stressed. "Or, here, I think, all forces, political 
included, should be interested. And all our valuable people -- 
and we do have such people -- should be attracted to this work 
of national interest."

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 22/1/1994 -- The Party of Social 
Democracy of Romania-PDSR (ruling party) and the Romanian 
National Unity Party [PUNR], that backs the government, consider 
necessary the continuation and strengthening of their 
collaboration, as well as its better coordination at all levels, 
its opening to new forms, including the PUNR participation in 
ruling the country, reads a protocol issued to the national 
agency ROMPRES. 
  The protocol mentions the two parties' will to further the 
process of democratization of the country and deepen the course 
of the economic reform, secure social protection, strengthen 
legality and public order, maintain the political and social 
stability in the country, gradually enlarge the basis of 
national consensus, as a requisite for the easing of the 
tensions in today's Romanian society, further the efforts for 
Romania's integration in the Euro-Atlantic space. Special 
attention, the protocol reads, will be paid in this respect to 
the development of the relations with the European communities, 
the consolidation of Romania's position in the Council of 
Europe, Romania's joining in the NATO as a strategic requisite 
for its political-military security within the new political 
architecture which is being built in Europe, the promotion of a 
foreign policy in keeping with the Romanian people's national 
interests, with its vocation as partner open to collaboration 
and understanding with other peoples, the neighbouring ones 
first of all. 
  The two parties stress the necessity that the future 
government should be a political one, so that all its members, 
starting with the prime minister, should be members of one of 
the parties making up the government coalition. It is envisaged 
in this respect to change the composition of the Nicolae 
Vacaroiu government, by switching from the current format of the 
government made up of members of the Party of Social Democracy 
of Romania and independent experts, to the format of a bicolour 
political government (PDSR and PUNR). To this end, the two 
parties agree upon including in the Vacaroiu cabinet, by January 
24, 1994, through government reshuffle, four PUNR 
representatives, who will be given the following ministerial 
portfolios: justice, agriculture, transport, communications. 
The candidacies for these portfolios will be analyzed together 
by the two parties' leaderships, with the participation of the 
prime minister. The same procedure will be employed in the case 
of possible changes with the portfolios of other ministries. 
  In view of furthering the process of democratization of the 
institutions of the state of law and in compliance with the 
Council of Europe's recommendations, the two parties agree that 
the future ministers of national defence and the interior should 
be civilian political personalities.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 22/1/1994 -- The National 
Council of the Romanian National Unity Party [PUNR] discussed on 
January 22 the results of the negotiations conducted between the 
PUNR and the Party of Social Democracy of Romania [PDSR] 
regarding the PUNR offer to participate in the government, as 
well as the content of the draft protocol articulated to that 
end, reads a release issued to the national agency ROMPRES by 
the PUNR National Council. 
  The National Council endorses the protocol provisions, 
considering them to be the minimal condition for the PUNR 
participation in the government. If the PDSR fails to apply the 
provisions of the respective protocol, the PUNR will withdraw 
its parliamentary backing of the current government. 
  The PUNR National Council considers that the PUNR 
participation in the government is a major political decision of 
a nature to redeem to the nation the confidence and hope for the 
country's economic recovery and the improvement of the social 
life, giving the act of governing more authoritativeness, 
dynamism, competence, responsibility, the release reads.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 25/1/1994 -- The cabinet met on 
Monday evening, 24 January, under the chairmanship of Prime 
Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu for an in-depth analysis of the 
factors causing the financial blockage in the Romanian economy 
and of the solutions proposed to fight it. 
  Present at the meeting were State Minister Mircea Cosea, 
head 
of the Council for Economic Coordination, Strategy and Reform, 
State Minister Dan Mircea Popescu in charge of labor and 
welfare, State Minister Florin Georgescu in charge of finance, 
Justice Minister Petre Ninosu, Industry Minister Dumitru 
Popescu, Transport Minister Paul Teodoru. Also present were 
National Bank Governor Mugur Isarescu, the presidents of the 
main merchant banks, representatives of the State Ownership 
Fund, counselors, experts. 
  The meeting examined a report drawn up by a panel of 
experts, 
and debated a plan to ease financial circuits with immediate, 
medium and long-range effects. The decision was made that for 
1994 the shortage of liquidities in the payment system should be 
tackled gradually and cautiously by first addressing the root 
causes of the financial blocking and then its effects, in 
parallel with the gradual easing of money issuance based on the 
actual offer of goods and services in demand on the market, so 
that a spiralling inflation-inducing surplus of the money mass 
could be averted. Basically, the government will take over as 
part of its public debt some of the unsettled expenditures in 
the region of lei 210 billion, an amount now incorporated in 
nonperforming stocks of goods generated by investment projects 
started prior to 1990, and in foreign trade deals engaged on 
behalf of the Romanian state before the 1991 unification of the 
currency rates. Besides the takeover by the government of some 
of the nonperforming credits deriving from discontinued 
investment projects in state-run companies, relief is expected 
to come also from an injection of liquidities from these 
companies' working capital estimated to grow by 46 billion lei, 
with which the companies in question will be able to pay some of 
their arrears. In compliance with the regulations adopted in 
1993, the government directed that 23 billion lei be supplied to 
financial circuits as damages for the 1993 natural calamities; 
another 83 billion lei for the payment of fertilizers 
distributed free to agricultural producers; and 50 billion lei 
for incentives to industrial units exporting 
long-manufacturing-cycle goods. 
  It was resolved as well that credits in the worth of 400 
billion lei be granted for farm works, phased out for the entire 
length of the spring agricultural campaign. Three quarters of 
the amount will be secured from the sale out of the food stocks 
for the winter period, credited by the Agricultural Bank (BA). 
  The strategy the government has opted for in agreement with 
the National Bank pursues a better allocation of resources 
through market mechanisms and by maintaining the current credit 
lines at the reference interest of the National Bank within the 
ranges agreed upon by Romania with its external partners. 
Maximum attention will be devoted to correlating a stronger 
currency discipline with domestic payments. The Ministry of 
Finance and the National Bank shall regularly inspect and report 
on how the hard currency repatriation regulations and the access 
are being to the hard currency market rules are being complied 
with. 
  The working capital of the state companies working on profit 
shall be augmented by 50 billion lei from the dividends paid 
into the Private Ownership Funds (FPP) and the State Ownership 
Fund (FPS). The improvement will be sought of the refunding 
mechanisms and instruments at the level of the entire economy. 
The prime minister particularly stressed the need to have it 
clearly settled as to the degree of responsibility incumbent on 
the administrative management of state-run units, and to spell 
out the duties of the FPP's and FPS. In his opinion, the 
financial blocking is concentrated, paradoxically so, he said, 
in the raw material and energy producing sectors, and requested 
the ministries concerned to center their circuit smoothing 
actions on state companies that owe arrears to primary sectors. 
He insisted on the necessity for a more active participation of 
the FPP's and of the FPS as rightful owners of the units 
generating the financial blockage.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 21 (CTK) -- The Slovak Foreign 
Ministry has rejected statements made by Hungarian Foreign 
Minister Geza Jeszenszky in an interview for the Polish weekly 
POLITYKA in which he questions Slovakia's compliance with its 
commitments in the framework of the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and the Council of Europe (CE). 
  In a statement given to CTK today the Ministry expressed 
surprise that the Hungarian foreign minister has assumed the 
right of arbitration in assessing whether the Slovak Republic is 
fulfilling its multilateral obligations. Jeszenszky again 
described Slovakia's attitude towards the Hungarian minority as 
the only problem in Slovak-Hungarian relations and stressed that 
the problem of borders between the two countries did not exist 
and that there was thus no need to deal with it. 
  Slovakia is interested in concluding a basic interstate 
treaty with Hungary and it reiterates its readiness to provide 
guarantees that Hungarian minority rights will be observed in 
Slovakia in the spirit of international norms. However at the 
same time Slovakia demands that a clause on inviolability of 
borders be included in the treaty, the statement says. 
  Jeszenszky's statements do not serve to create mutual trust 
and they could lead to the strengthening of the positions of 
extremists on both sides, which could endanger the atmosphere 
for solving other open questions between the two countries, the 
statement says.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 21 (CTK) -- Slovak Prime Minister 
Vladimir Meciar said on Slovak radio today he did not expect 
that the questions concerning the disputed stretches of the 
Czech-Slovak border could be resolved this year. He was 
reacting to statements made by Czech and Slovak Interior 
Ministers Jan Ruml and Jozef Tuchynna last week that they would 
recommend that, in the process of solving open questions 
surrounding the Czech-Slovak border, the Sidonie village be 
joined to the Czech Republic while the part of the Moravian 
village Javornik, called U Sabotu, be joined to the Slovak 
village Vrbovce. 
  "The ministers have only a consultative function," Meciar 
said, adding that the border questions lie in the jurisdiction 
of parliaments. Meciar confirmed his commitment that "not a 
square centimeter of Slovak land will be given to the Czech part 
without compensation and without the act being confirmed by 
agreement of the legislative bodies." 
  Regarding another problem concerning the Czech holiday 
cottage resort of Kasarna near the Slovak village of Makov, 
Meciar said that the Slovak side considers any discussion with 
the Czechs on the problem to be out of the question.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 23 (CTK) -- Slovak Foreign Minister 
Jozef Moravcik said today that the question of European security 
could not be solved without Russia's participation. Speaking in 
a Slovak Television discussion program "Kroky" (Steps), Moravcik 
said that there was no reason for Russia to feel threatened by a 
possible eastwards expansion of NATO. He said the apprehension 
could be removed by the signature of a package of agreements 
between Russia and Nato. 
  Russian Ambassador to Slovakia Sergey Yastrzhembskiy said 
that the Partnership for Peace plan had dispelled Russia's fears 
of a new power division of Europe. He said that a large portion 
of the Russian society, brought up in the totalitarian faith 
that the NATO countries were its major enemies, disagreed with 
the pact's expansion. To overlook this would strengthen the 
positions of Russian ultra-nationalist forces, Yastrzhembskiy 
stressed. If this situation is to be coped with, no "overhasty" 
expansion of the pact must be allowed, Russia must be given an 
active role in the implementation of the partnership, a treaty 
between the alliance and Moscow could be signed. 
  U.S. Ambassador to Slovakia Theodore Russell said that 
Moscow's fears could be best dispelled if Russia joined the 
Partnership for Peace. 
  Slovak Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak said Slovakia was 
intensively drafting a law providing for civil control of the 
Armed Forces, one of the conditions of the partnership. Under 
the law, two thirds of the Defense Ministry's staff are to be 
civilians. Russell praised the Slovak approach to the plan. 
  Moravcik confirmed once again that Slovakia's goal was 
fully-fledged membership of NATO, adding that the Partnership 
for Peace was the "entrance gate" to it.

  [Text] Moscow, January 21 (CTK) -- Slovakia is buying $80 
to 90 million worth of Russian military technology as part of 
the Soviet debt reduction program, Slovak State Defense 
Secretary Igor Urban said today after talks with Russian 
leaders. Before flying to Moscow, Urban had talked about buying 
supplies of military technology worth "over $50 million." The 
precise sum and the sort of technology to be bought would be 
decided by experts from both countries over the coming weeks, 
Urban said, adding that the Slovak Army had been already using 
the same technology this year. Urban said that during his 
Moscow talks there was no sign of the crisis which has arisen 
around the reorganization of the Russian Government. He met 
Russian Deputy Defense Minister Boris Gromov, and together they 
signed a plan for military cooperation between the two countries 
for this year, which covers about 20 joint actions. 
  The plan was not part of the Partnership for Peace, Urban 
said, because the Russian-Slovak military agreement had been 
concluded before this year's NATO Summit in Brussels. 
  On November 30 last year Slovakia and the Russian Federation 
signed a protocol on "The achievement of an agreement concerning 
the partial reduction of the debts of the former Soviet Union 
and the Russian Federation towards the Slovak Republic in the 
form of supplies of special technology." On the basis of this 
agreement, in December Slovakia bought weapons and military 
technology worth $180 million. The main items were five Russian 
MiG-29 fighter planes and spare parts for various types of 
weapon. 
  During his November visit to Moscow, Slovak Defense Minister 
Imrich Andrejcak stressed that Moscow was not capable of paying 
debts, and the Paris agreements allowed its debts to be shelved 
until 1996. "It is really a concession on the part of the 
Russians that they are willing to write off the supply from the 
debt, and it suits us," Andrejcak said. 
  After the division of the former Czechoslovakia, the former 
Soviet Union's debts to Slovakia amounted to approximately $1.5 
billion.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 24 (CTK) -- In a statement released 
today, Defense Ministry State Secretary Igor Urban said recent 
insinuations that Slovakia was decreasing Russia's debt to it by 
taking weapons instead were a "deliberate misinterpretation." 
The former Soviet Union currently owes Slovakia about $1.5 
billion. Slovakia will seek to recover at least part of the 
amount by capitalizing its claims, making decisions on the basis 
of the debtor's payment ability to pay and the Slovak 
Government's needs, the statement says. 
  On November 30, 1993, Slovakia and Russia signed a protocol 
on reaching an agreement on partially decreasing the 
indebtedness of the former Soviet Union and the Russian 
Federation to the Slovak republic through deliveries of special 
technology. On the basis of this agreement, Slovakia bought in 
December six Russian MiG-29 fighter planes and spare parts for 
various other equipment, worth a total of $180 million. 
  On Friday [21 January] in Moscow, Urban announced that 
Slovakia would reduce the debt further by buying another $80-90 
million worth of equipment. Like Hungary, Slovakia is 
attempting to get partial payment in the form of replacement 
parts for the Russian military equipment which the Slovak Army 
uses, according to the statement. Because technical systems 
cannot be changed from one day to the next in order to be 
compatible with NATO's weapons systems, it is necessary to 
maintain our present equipment in combat readiness. This is not 
possible without deliveries of replacement parts. 
  Urban emphasized that the deliveries did not indicate a 
Slovak orientation to the East. Nor is this measure to be 
explained as a lack of seriousness towards our NATO partners.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 20 (CTK) -- The mayor of the 
southern Slovak town of Samorin, Joszef Kvarda, who was removed 
from office today, is one of the first victims from the ranks of 
Hungarian minority leaders who organized the Komarno meeting on 
January 8, chairman of the Egyutteles (Coexistence) Hungarian 
minority movement Miklos Duray said today. Duray told CTK that 
Kvarda's dismissal was revenge of the government for his 
participation in organizing the meeting, at which ethnic 
Hungarians' demands were formulated. Duray said that even 
before the Komarno meeting chairman of the district council Eva 
Bubniakova threatened to remove Kvarda. "At that time we 
considered it the expression of a momentary mood," Duray said. 
As a member of the Association of Towns and Villages of Zitny 
Island (SMOZO), Kvarda was one of the main organizers of the 
Komarno meeting. 
  Kvarda was not given any reasons for his dismissal. He told 
CTK that given the fact that his performance had recently been 
assessed very positively and that on November 24 he was given a 
bonus for "the fulfillment of exceptional and especially 
important work tasks," he considered his dismissal to be 
unambiguously politically motivated. Kvarda added, however, 
that the chairman of the district council was not obliged by law 
to give reasons for dismissal, adding that he himself had 
practically no possibility of legal protection. 
  Duray said it was thus far the first known case of 
punishment 
for the organization of the Komarno meeting, but he did not rule 
out that others will follow as several chairman of district 
councils attended the meeting. At the Komarno meeting, 
representatives of ethnic Hungarians raised demands for the 
creation of regions in which the Hungarian minority would make 
up majority as well as for educational and cultural autonomy.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 22 (CTK) -- Milan Zemko from the 
Slovak Presidential Office today said that the contradictory 
statements and moves by the parliament and government "are 
narrowing the scope for negotiations with Hungarian partners," 
Slovak Radio reported. Speaking at a discussion-meeting 
organized by the Forum Foundation, Zemko was reacting to the 
current tense situation among the Hungarian ethnic minority 
which is 560,000-strong and which constitutes 11 percent of 
Slovakia's population. The Hungarians criticize the Slovak 
authorities of not observing minority rights, and they have 
called for autonomy in southern Slovakia, where most of them 
live. Jan Carnogursky, chairman of the opposition Christian 
Democratic Movement (KDH), said that as early as 1987 
cooperation between the Hungarian and Slovak dissidents had been 
subdued due to the Hungarians' unwillingness to recognize the 
inviolability of the existing Slovak-Hungarian border.

  [Text] Kosice, east Slovakia, Jan 21 (CTK) -- A Hungarian 
Democratic Forum (MDF) delegation arrived here today for a three 
day visit to search for new possibilities to promote contacts 
and cooperation between the two countries in cultural and 
economic spheres. The delegation is made up of Sandor Lezsak, 
executive chairman of the governing MDF and the party's deputy 
chairmen -- Peter Nahimi and Tamas Szabo, who is also Hungarian 
privatization minister. 
  In an interview with CTK Lezsak said that cooperation 
between 
Hungary and Slovakia could not be developed in a confrontational 
atmosphere. He said the current visit had been prepared for 
half a year and was taking place at the invitation of the 
chairman of the Egyutteles (Coexistence) Hungarian minority 
movement, Miklos Duray, who is also accompanying the delegation. 
  The delegation met with representatives of the Hungarian 
minority living in the Mezibodrozi region in the morning. Later 
in the day its members visited Kosice to hold talks with Kosice 
Mayor Rudolf Bauer who acquainted them with a proposal for the 
future administrative division of Slovakia drawn up by the Club 
of Mayors. The proposal envisages the establishment of 16 
historical counties. The MDF delegation expressed "sympathy" 
with the proposal. 
  In the remaining days, the Hungarian guests will visit 
individual towns in southern Slovakia to meet with 
representatives of local administration and of political and 
civic organizations of the Hungarian minority. They are also 
expected to meet church representatives before travelling home 
on Sunday.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 23 (CTK) -- Sandor Lezsak, chairman 
of Hungary's ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), said today 
that a Hungarian-Slovak treaty would not be signed until the 
Hungarian ethnic minority's fundamental rights were recognized 
in Slovakia, Slovak Radio reported. Lezsak praised the high 
political culture of the leaders of the Hungarian parties 
represented in the Slovak parliament, but criticized Slovak 
politicians for lack of accommodating stands. They consider 
representatives of the Hungarian minority their "hostages" and 
provoke them by instigating hysteria and rumors, the radio 
quoted Lezsak as saying. 
  The Hungarian minority of 560,000 or 11 percent of the 
Slovak 
population, is represented in the parliament by the Egyutteles 
movement (9 out of a total of 150 parliamentary seats) and the 
Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH, 5 seats). 
Egyutteles Chairman Miklos Duray told the radio that his 
movement now "works as a bridge between Slovak and Hungarian 
officials." He claimed that the aim of the MDF three-man 
delegation's three-day visit to Slovakia was to study on the 
spot the living conditions of ethnic minorities. 
  Reacting to the positive evaluation of Slovakia's 
nationality 
policy by Max van der Stoel, high commissioner of the Conference 
on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) for ethnic 
minorities, and Miguel Angel Martinez, president of the 
Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (CE), who 
visited Slovakia this week, Duray said they had been given 
one-sided information, probably "only from Mr. Meciar (Slovak 
prime minister).

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 24 (CTK) -- The Slovak National 
Party (SNS) parliamentary group will back a government bill on 
large privatization in a form submitted by the ruling Movement 
For a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), Slovak Premier and HZDS 
Chairman Vladimir Meciar said today. Unlike the government 
bill, an opposition proposal by the Democratic Left Party (SDL) 
provides for separation of the post of privatization minister 
and that of chairman of the National Property Fund (FNM) 
presidium, now being taken by Meciar. It also seeks the 
separation of the posts of finance minister and chairman of the 
FNM supervising council, now being occupied by Julius Toth. 
After today's SNS-HZDS talks, Meciar said that from the 
economic viewpoint it is right that constitutional 
representatives be linked with the FNM. 
  SNS honorary Chairman Jozef Prokes said that it is 
impossible 
that one person take decisions and the other bear responsibility 
for the results of privatization. 
  If the opposition submits a proposal to recall Minister of 
Transport and Telecommunications Roman Hofbauer, the HZDS and 
part of the SNS deputies will reject it, Meciar said. The 
attempt to dismiss Hofbauer is caused by his insensitive 
approach to the removal of bilingual (Slovak and Hungarian) road 
signs of villages in southern Slovakia (where the majority of 
the 560,000-strong Hungarian minority reside) and his 
interference in broadcasts of the Radio Station Free Europe on 
the Slovak territory. 
  Out of a total of 150 deputies in the National Council of 
the 
Slovak Republic (parliament), 66 seats are occupied by the HZDS, 
28 by the opposition SDL and 14 by the coalition SNS.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 24 (CTK) -- Slovak President Michal 
Kovac hopes to give a boost to flagging Slovak-Polish trade on 
his forthcoming three-day visit to Poland. Although Poland is 
in the top ten of Slovakia's trading partners, the country's 
share in total Slovak turnover last year was only 2.5 percent. 
The figure has plummeted since 1990, but experts believe the 
level will be maintained next year. Therefore, on his visit 
from January 25-27, Kovac will be accompanied by a trade 
delegation consisting of Chairman of the Slovak Trade and 
Industry Chamber Petr Mihok and representatives of companies 
which have most contact with Polish companies. 
  Slovak Economics Ministry figures show that Slovak-Polish 
trade was worth 11.7 billion Czechoslovak crowns [Sk] in 1991, 
about $390 million, but over the next two years sank to Sk7.7 
billion, $255 million, then Sk7.1 billion, $235 million. 
Slovakia throughout this has retained a surplus -- the year 
before last Sk856 million around, $28.5 million, and in ten 
months of last year over a billion crowns, $33 million. 
  Among the biggest commodities are Polish coal and Slovak 
consumer goods and machinery. 
  We want to revitalize trade with Poland, which has the 
biggest market of all the countries in the Central European Free 
Trade Area (CEFTA) but which we have the smallest trade turnover 
with of all CEFTA countries, Peter Kovac, director of the 
transition economy department of the economics ministry, told 
CTK today. Peter Kovac, who will also be a member of President 
Kovac's trade delegation to Poland, said he did not anticipate 
the signing of any trade agreements but did expect new contacts 
to be established. Tariff barriers, one of the greatest 
obstacles to mutual trade, will be done away with within the 
framework of CEFTA in the next few years. However, trade is 
also impeded by under-funding and, in Peter Kovac's view, 
inadequate contacts and a mutual underestimation of the 
partner's products. Kovac nevertheless considers Poland a 
promising country, especially as it is the first post-communist 
country to achieve an increase in gross domestic product in 
spite of high inflation and other economic woes.

<F P=106> ["Statement by Prime Minister Lyuben Berov on the national </F>
budget" -- recorded] 
  [Text] My fellow countrymen: I address you at a very 
important time for the development of our country. It is now 
more than one year since this government assumed the leadership 
of the country under conditions that were very difficult 
regarding both the international and domestic situation. 
Despite this, in 1993 we achieved important results in 
implementing the government program. Annual inflation decreased 
15 percent. The fall in industrial output was sharply 
decreased. A provisional trade agreement was signed between 
Bulgaria and the European Union. Agreement was reached with the 
London Club on settling our foreign debt. A decision was 
adopted on settling the so-called bad debts of the state 
enterprises that date before 1991. Some 43 percent of the land 
was restored to former owners, and an additional 23 percent was 
allocated for provisional use. We saw the beginning of market 
privatization. All the conditions for rapidly carrying out the 
first stage of mass privatization were prepared, despite the 
fact that the relevant bill has already been delayed five months 
by the parliamentary commissions. We have fulfilled the promise 
to compensate for 95 percent of the income of pensioners and 
those who work in the state sector affected by inflation. 
Without this those people would have found themselves in a much 
more serious situation than existed in December 1992. 
  I do not say that there were no shortcomings in our work, 
but 
it is irresponsible to claim that nothing was accomplished 
during the past year. 
  At the beginning of 1994 we face a significant test -- the 
adoption of the 1994 state budget. In this sphere the 
government completed its work on time. The draft budget was 
prepared and submitted to the National Assembly at the beginning 
of December 1993. This draft is the cornerstone of the 
government's intentions in economic policy. 
  We fully realize that despite the achievements, the 
country's 
economy is still unstable. This requires us to implement 
balanced measures aimed at restructuring, stabilizing, 
maintaining, and developing the social welfare system and apply 
funds prudently. One of the cabinet's basic goals, in addition 
to the struggle against inflation and the economic crisis, is to 
resolve the issue of the country's foreign debt to commercial 
banks. In this way we will relieve our economy of the burden of 
its total isolation vis-a- vis the international financial 
markets. 
  The achievement of the economic policy goals proposed by the 
cabinet depends to a large extent on the support our country 
receives from the international financial community. This 
applies not only to the scope of the aid we will receive, but 
also to the timing of receiving it. 
  In the course of the discussion on the budget in the 
National 
Assembly and outside it demands were voiced by separate 
departments and public sectors to receive far more resources 
than envisaged by the budget. When such demands are voiced 
those who make them act purely from their own limited interests 
without taking into consideration the general national balance. 
Such a course is very easy and perhaps even very profitable 
from a political point of view. An impossible situation would 
emerge, however, if we all head in the same direction. 
  This government was elected on the basis of an 
anti-inflation 
program. Despite the views of some that it has not shown 
sufficient will to govern, the government has in fact followed 
this anti- inflation policy until now. The government will 
continue to follow this policy with determination, despite the 
unpopular measures that are occasionally necessary. 
  It is very easy to release the anti-inflation brakes and 
give 
everyone much higher pensions and wages, free medical services, 
free medicines, free higher education, and cheap apartments, 
heating, and electric power, all subsidized by the government. 
This is possible only if parliament relieves the government of 
the responsibility of struggling against inflation. 
  Either we wage this struggle, or by implementing the 
aforementioned benefits we will slide down the slope of 
accelerated inflation. There is no middle way. Let those who 
want a policy that leads to accelerated inflation have the 
courage to say so clearly and openly. 
  The draft budget is being discussed by the relevant 
parliamentary commissions and it will soon be included in the 
National Assembly agenda for its first reading. It must be 
pointed out that several important factors for the country 
depend on the final adoption of the budget at the second reading 
no later than 16 February. The government has already taken 
those factors into account in various agreements that it signed. 
  The first is the receipt of the financial aid from the G-24, 
which will meet on 4 March in Brussels to discuss financial 
issues. We expect aid from them to the tune of $300-330 million 
for financing the country's balance of payments on condition 
that the implementation of the government's economic policy 
begins on the basis of adopting the 1994 draft budget. However, 
the G-24 countries need a minimum of two weeks to prepare their 
meeting and assume their commitments. Precisely this determines 
the term that I have mentioned, namely, adopting the budget no 
later than 16 February. 
  Signing a new agreement with the IMF is another significant 
source of financing the country's process of reforms. This 
could be implemented by mid-March, if the budget is adopted by 
16 February. On this basis, even before the end of March the 
country could receive the first part of the financial aid, which 
amounts to about $150 million, and an additional $100 million 
from the World Bank structural restructuring loan. By about the 
same time -- 22 March -- and under the same preconditions a 
meeting of the Paris Club will take place. We expect from this 
meeting not only officially to reschedule the payments of our 
foreign debt at better conditions, but also to obtain an 
additional reduction of 50-60 percent on a bilateral basis. For 
this we are relying on France's active support. 
  If this entire chain reaction is not put into effect because 
we do not adopt or we delay the adoption of the Budget Bill, 
everything we achieved in the past year will lose its 
importance. The disruption of this chain of favorable 
opportunities that we have prepared by not adopting the 1994 
Budget Bill on time, will result in a sharp worsening of our 
balance of payments, the dollar exchange rate, accelerated 
inflation, and generally, an economic crisis in 1994. I would 
like to remind you that in addition to this financial aspect 
there is a social one: Everyone can imagine what effect all 
this will have on socially deprived circles and how pensions, 
grants, medical services, education, culture, the police, and 
the army, on which the country's security depends, will be 
affected. In such a case, if the adoption of the budget is 
delayed after 16 February, or if the Budget Bill is not adopted 
by the National Assembly, the government will not be held 
responsible for the consequences. The government's task ends 
here, namely, with ensuring this chain of favorable 
opportunities. From this point on the responsibility belongs to 
parliament. Therefore I appeal to politicians to adopt the 
budget by mid-February. Afterward, everyone may act in 
accordance with his own understanding. However, now, those 
politicians in and outside parliament who cause a delay in 
adopting the budget or prevent its adoption will be betraying 
the interests of their people and, because of their malice and 
political shortsightedness, they are prepared to ruin the 
country if they cannot rule it. It is not in this way that one 
could assume power in the country. 
  The last opportunity to adopt the budget on time will be if 
it is put on the National Assembly agenda on Thursday [27 
January] or Friday [28 February]. The two Mondays and Tuesdays 
before 16 February must become regular working days for the 
National Assembly. 
  I appeal to the National Assembly members not only to adopt 
the Budget Bill rapidly, but also to show a responsible and 
competent approach during the debate. 
  The alternative to adopting the budget is obvious -- 
immediate new parliamentary elections. Simultaneously, the 
sociological polls and the experts imply that this is an 
illusionary alternative, unwanted by the political forces and 
the voters. The elections will immediately mean that the 
country will be in the midst of a desperate political crisis 
that will lead to economic chaos and delayed reforms. 
  There are only those two alternatives. No compromise is 
possible. You must select one of the two alternatives in the 
next few days. It was my duty today to warn you all about this, 
so that tomorrow there will be no misunderstanding as to who 
defended the national needs and who must bear the responsibility 
for causing the premeditated economic-political disaster in our 
country. Let us rally this time around the necessity to adopt 
the budget on time, and thus demonstrate that we are a nation 
that merits respect, and one that can understand and defend its 
common interests. Otherwise we will be at the end of the line. 
In such a case the difficulties that we have experienced in the 
last three years will be in vain, and the next government will 
have to begin everything anew. 
  Thank you very much.

<F P=106> ["Recorded comments" by parliamentary deputies and party </F>
leaders on Prime Minister Berov's statement on national radio on 
25 January -- recorded] 
  [Text] How do the Bulgarian Socialists assess Prime 
Minister Lyuben Berov's statement on national radio today. Here 
is a comment by Nora Ananieva, chairman of the parliamentary 
group of the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] and its coalition: 
  [Ananieva] The prime minister's viewpoint was realistic, in 
the sense that stability, our authority, continuing the reform 
without interruption, and developing our international contacts 
all depend on the budget being passed. 
  [Announcer] Professor Lyuben Berov's address provoked a 
quick reaction from the SDS [Union of Democratic Forces] 
coalition. Here is what Filip Dimitrov, chairman of the SDS 
National Coordinating Council, had to say: 
  [Dimitrov] We have long considered that the only reasonable 
alternative to the chaos that reigns in the country's economy 
and the drama that is developing on the streets of Bulgarian 
towns is to hold new elections. Accordingly, in making his 
statement, the prime minister hardly discovered America. As 
regards the issue of the budget, in his statement the prime 
minister made a fetish, as it were, of the act of adopting a 
law, but disregarded its contents. 
  [Announcer] The parliamentary group of the Rights and 
Freedoms Movement [DPS] will support the initiative calling for 
a special plenary session of parliament on the state budget 
bill, but the DPS deputies do not consider that 16 February is a 
realistic deadline for adopting the budget. Here is a comment 
from DPS parliamentary representative Osman Oktay on the prime 
minister's statement: 
  [Oktay] I would describe the prime minister's statement on 
the budget as somewhat overhasty. We have assured him -- we 
have given an assurance in the proper place -- that we will do 
everything possible to speed up the submission of the budget to 
a plenary session of the National Assembly. 
  [Announcer] DPS deputies expressed their disquiet over the 
delays in the examination of the budget by certain parliamentary 
commissions. According to them, the early submission of the 
budget bill to the full parliament is of importance primarily in 
connection with our commitments under the agreement with the 
international financial institutions. According to Deputy 
Oktay, the president will probably meet with the DPS leader 
[Ahmed Dogan] next week. According to DPS Deputy Serife Mustafa, 
this meeting may take place tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Todor Churov by </F>
Miroslava Badzheva; place and date not given: "To Be Outside 
NATO Means To Be Far From Europe"] 
  [Text] [Badzheva] Mr. Churov, do you share the view that 
the Partnership for Peace initiative is a Washington's 
compromise with Moscow's nuclear power? 
  [Churov] In essence, Partnership for Peace is a compromise 
between at least three quantities. The first is NATO as an 
organization, which is well aware that it has to change its 
character and, probably, its range of action. Second, there are 
the countries of Eastern Europe, practically all of which have 
declared that they want full membership. The third factor is 
Russia. As a result of the balance between these three 
quantities, whose interests both coincide and diverge in certain 
fields, we have Partnership for Peace. 
  For some time now, NATO has been facing the problem of how 
to 
take account of the new circumstances, which tend to induce 
changes in an organization that from the outset was formed and 
adapted to the bipolar security model. Now there is a new 
understanding of security, a realization of the need for a new 
architecture for the security structures and, in the final 
analysis, for new, more varied forms of behavior. 
  For its part, Russia displays a degree of sensitivity 
regarding NATO's position and, more precisely, its geographical 
scope. Russia is a state of the first magnitude, regardless of 
the problems that it is suffering at the moment. It continues 
to be a leading state and a permanent member of the UN Security 
Council, and it has a first-grade nuclear potential at its 
disposal. As a state, it carries great weight in international 
relations, and NATO cannot fail to take it into consideration. 
A further important factor is the internal political balance 
inside Russia between forces that are rather skeptical about 
cooperation with the West and other forces that believe this is 
the only reasonable alternative. 
  Third, we have the states of Central and Eastern Europe. 
Following the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, they have found 
themselves in a certain "security vacuum" and naturally have the 
lawful right to seek guarantees for their security, territorial 
integrity, and sovereignty, which includes following a 
consistent policy aimed at joining the West European or 
Euro-Atlantic structures. Accordingly, in the final analysis, 
Partnership for Peace is a vector resulting from these three 
lines of force representing different interests and foreign 
policy behavior. 
  [Badzheva] Is Moscow applying any pressure on our statesmen 
to keep us from joining NATO? 
  [Churov] I have no information to confirm such a thesis. I 
think rather that Russia's attempts to exert influence are 
directed toward the West. A certain postulate has been strongly 
expressed in statements recently made by NATO politicians, and 
it contains a grain of logic. It suggests that the immediate 
inclusion of a group of states from Central and Eastern Europe, 
or only from Central Europe, in NATO would in practice mean 
shifting a line of division further to the east, no matter where 
it should end up -- at Russia's borders or somewhere to the west 
of our own border. 
  I think that at the present stage, we cannot fail to 
appreciate Russia's problem -- no such line of division should 
exist. Anyway, this was the message sent to the NATO summit 
meeting in Brussels. 
  [Badzheva] In the Western press, Partnership for Peace has 
revived the hypothesis of a "new Yalta," according to which the 
Central and East European countries would again be left within 
Moscow's sphere of influence. What do you think about this? 
  [Churov] To be able to claim that such an accord exists, one 
needs to have absolutely authentic information. One cannot 
simply put forward hypotheses. 
  On the other hand, attempts are still being made to 
delineate 
spheres of civilized compatibility. Ideas were suggested of 
making culturological divisions between the countries of Europe, 
based on religious traditions, alphabets, and ethnic features, 
and according to this, we lie in the eastern orbit. However, 
this thesis does not hold water, because it refers to a 
Byzantine Europe, but the state that historically personifies 
Byzantium turns out to be one of the Western group of countries. 
I am referring to Greece, which is already quite well 
integrated in both NATO and the European Union. 
  [Badzheva] Nevertheless, views still prevail that 
Partnership for Peace restricts the countries of the former 
socialist block from holding full membership in NATO. 
  [Churov] First and foremost, Partnership for Peace 
represents a commitment on the part of NATO to open up the 
organization to the East. It is something like the EU's 
Copenhagen declaration, in which it declared that in principle 
it was an organization with an open character. The states that 
have been active in the Partnership for Peace Initiative will be 
able to hold consultations similar in scope and content to those 
specified in Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty. This means 
that in the event of a direct threat appearing to their national 
security and sovereignty, the member countries will be able to 
seek consultations with NATO on these issues. 
  The second level of Partnership for Peace is that it gives 
the opportunity to the states of Central and Eastern Europe, if 
they so desire, to participate in important NATO military and 
political bodies. This gives them real access to the process of 
formulating decisions, despite the fact that this cannot, of 
course, be compared to full-blown participation in the 
decisionmaking process. In addition, the initiative provides 
for cooperation in specific military-technical fields, such as 
military planning, access to certain types of confidential 
information, cooperation in the fields of troop training, 
command, and administration, and, naturally, participation in 
wide-scale costly operations, such as joint military exercises, 
joint peacekeeping operations, and so on. 
  [Badzheva] Has NATO invited us to take part in joint 
military maneuvers this year? 
  [Churov] In principle, NATO is planning to hold joint 
maneuvers in 1994 but, so far, it is not clear which states in 
Central and Eastern Europe will take part in them. It has been 
left to them to decide whether they are ready to join in and 
allocate the relevant resources. However, we have already been 
invited to notify them which of our combat units might be placed 
at NATO's disposal for joint operations of this type. 
  [Badzheva] Are we ready to answer in the affirmative? 
  [Churov] No, and not only us. It is still too early. 
  [Badzheva] Are you afraid that the states of the former 
socialist camp are moving toward NATO at two speeds and that we 
are in the second group? 
  [Churov] I would say that from now on, the states of Central 
and Eastern Europe, and not only them, will move at more than 
two speeds. Despite our formal equal standing, in a certain 
sense, this is embodied in the Partnership for Peace initiative 
itself. For many countries, the initiative essentially 
represents a solution to their situation and, for this reason, 
they find this program exceptionally acceptable. Some states 
will turn out to be better organized, better equipped from the 
material viewpoint, and with a stronger psychological motivation 
and a higher level of public awareness. In other words, these 
states might prove to be more suitable for faster integration 
into NATO. 
  [Badzheva] Nevertheless, we can demonstrate our activity 
only within the limits of our financial capabilities, because no 
one knows how we will be able to pay for our cooperation with 
NATO. Does this mean that the richer states will overtake us? 
  [Churov] This is possible. However, if we give high 
priority to our links with NATO on national security grounds, we 
could allocate more funds. If again we reach the assessment 
that the balance between the economic factor, including our 
financial problems, and the aspiration to integrate with NATO is 
in favor of giving priority to economic problems, the outcome 
would be different. 
  In this case, however, the statement made by Ms. Albright 
during her visit offers us some reassurance. She said that the 
quantitative aspect is not so important as the qualitative one, 
and as far as the latter is concerned, I do not think we are 
inferior to any other state. 
  [Badzheva] What does the qualitative aspect include? 
  [Churov] From the political viewpoint, it includes 
conducting sensible foreign policy, acting as a stabilizing 
factor, not having any territorial claims against our neighbors, 
having a democratic social system, abiding by international 
obligations, and so on. As regards all these requirements, 
Bulgaria is in no way inferior to the other states of Central 
and Eastern Europe. Our state also has to prove that it is a 
reliable partner in the Partnership for Peace initiative. 
  [Badzheva] Do you consider that a condition for us joining 
NATO is that our weapons should conform to Western standards? 
  [Churov] If we talk about Western standards, it is a 
somewhat paradoxical fact that the East European armies are 
standardized to a far higher degree -- that is, they are far 
much more compatible than the NATO armies. In this respect, I 
am inclined to think that the idea that we are unsuitable for 
NATO because our standards are totally different is somewhat of 
a myth. 
  [Badzheva] Is it possible to say that, in a certain sense, 
military diplomacy has outstripped classical diplomacy on our 
path toward NATO? 
  [Churov] I would not make this distinction, because it is 
very difficult to separate the one from the other. It is true 
that a number of specific programs for cooperation with NATO 
exist in the military-technical field. On the other hand, the 
political process is also quite well developed. 
  [Badzheva] In your opinion, who in Bulgaria is afraid of 
NATO? 
  [Churov] I do not know if we can talk about fears. However, 
a certain trend does exist, and among serious politicians at 
that, who think that it is not the best thing for Bulgaria to 
commit itself to one or another organization or state, and that 
Bulgaria should be neutral. 
  In the present conditions, the very concept of "neutrality" 
is losing its meaning in a world that is no longer bipolar, thus 
presupposing the existence of third neutral countries. In 
organizations like NATO, in which mutual cooperation is 
developed to a high degree, a democratic process exists for 
reaching decisions, and the interests of all are considered, the 
member states are divided into two groups: the insiders and the 
outsiders. The ones inside have advantages, while those outside 
are in practice prevented from being able to influence the 
collective decision- making process. 
  If we decide not to integrate ourselves with NATO at such a 
speed and show a tendency to consider whether we have any other 
alternatives, this will inevitably place us in the second 
category, even when we are equal in all other respects to the 
other Central and East European countries. In this case, there 
is a very big risk that this would have a knock-on effect 
regarding the process of our integration into the European Union 
and other similar structures.

  [Text] We briefly reported on today's meeting between 
Minister of Finance Stoyan Aleksandrov and Professor Ivan Lalov 
in some of our news programs. Commenting on the talks, Minister 
Aleksandrov reportedly said that the demands of the students on 
strike have been fulfilled. Let us hear some of his latest 
remarks on the subject as submitted to BTA: 
  The strike of the Sofia University students is political, 
the 
finance minister declared in briefing the media at the Council 
of Ministers headquarters today. He is convinced that the 
students have either been deceived, or are acting at someone's 
instructions. I am even in doubt whether a strike exists at 
all, considering that 500 people cannot possible represent the 
interests of 140,000 students all over the country, Minister 
Stoyan Aleksandrov is reported as saying. 
  After his meeting with Prof. Ivan Lalov, during which he was 
informed of the demands of the strikers, the finance minister 
resolutely declared that he would neither negotiate with the 
strikers nor sign any agreements with them. According to the 
minister, the scholarships were paid from the university's 
extrabudgetary funds on the basis of the rectors' decision. The 
university's leadership preferred to spend the means of the 
state subsidies for its own wages, which were increased by 40 
percent. 
  Stoyan Aleksandrov described as preposterous the claim that 
2 
percent of the gross national domestic product should be spent 
on education as of 1995. According to him, the (?state 
subsidies) will not be abolished, but it should be considered 
whether to preserve the current system of distribution in higher 
educational institutions, or whether a new scheme should be 
adopted at the suggestion of the rectors, in accordance with the 
specialists required in different spheres. The legal documents 
related to scholarships, students' hostels, and credits for 
students shall be adopted in one package, as the strikers 
demand, but this will presumably take place only at the 
beginning of the next or in the middle of the current school 
year, the minister is reported as saying.

<F P=106> [Report by Asen Asenov and Diana Tsankova] </F>
  [Text] The number of students on strike at Sofia's St. 
Kliment Okhridski University is steadily increasing. Following 
yesterday's meeting of the Academic Council, about 7,000 
intellectuals, professors, and citizens signed a petition in 
support of the student strike. Today, students from the 
University of National and World Economics joined in supporting 
the demands of their Sofia University colleagues and will 
probably issue their own declaration. 
  The strike committee will set up a group of experts to 
prepare a standpoint regarding the strike declaration, including 
item 1, which demands that 2 percent of the GDP should be 
allocated to science and education. The protest has already 
produced an international reaction: a NEW YORK TIMES journalist 
has interviewed the striking students. 
  Minister of Science and Education Marko Todorov issued an 
official statement on the student strike, in which he said that 
it is political in nature and that the demand for 2 percent of 
the GDP to be allocated to education and science cannot be 
satisfied. 
  The sit-in at the university continues. At a general meeting 
tomorrow, professors and staff of the university are expected to 
declare their own strike, because more than 50 percent of the 
signatures required have already been collected. 
  Today Prime Minister Lyuben Berov received representatives 
of 
six student organizations, who expressed disquiet regarding the 
occupation of Sofia University and the politicization of the 
strike. They called upon the executive power to help to ensure 
that the rights of students who want to take their examinations 
and not interrupt the study session are not restricted. The 
prime minister undertook to speak to Sofia University Rector 
Professor Lalov, asking him to bring under control the tension 
that is developing between the striking students and those not 
on strike.

<F P=106> [Report by Nedko Petrov: "The Chief of the General Staff </F>
Would Not Resign"] 
  [Text] On 18 January Army General Lyuben Petrov, chief of 
the General Staff, invited correspondents who cover Army issues 
to the Central Army Club in Sofia. Despite the fact that it was 
previously announced that the meeting would not be a news 
conference, the General Staff chief answered several questions 
regarding problems in the Bulgarian Army. General Petrov 
considers the new military budget extremely insufficient for the 
Army, especially since war is raging along our western border. 
However, the Army chief said that contrary to reports that 
appeared immediately after the draft military budget was 
published, even if the budget is adopted, he would not resign. 
"I will not desert the Army, but I also will not be held 
responsible for the Bulgarian Army's combat readiness, " General 
Petrov said. 
  The General Staff chief admitted participating in working 
out 
the presidential decree on the functions and prerogatives of the 
president's Military Office but refused to comment on the issue 
until the National Security Commission takes a stand.

<F P=106> [Interview with Tosho Mukhtanov, chairman of National </F>
Assembly Defense Industry Commission, by Major Spiridon 
Spiridonov; place and date not given: "The Arms Industry Cannot 
Expect Serious Orders"] 
  [Text] [Spiridonov] Your commission has already begun to 
discuss the state budget draft bill. What are your first 
impressions? 
  [Mukhtanov] Our first discussion was primarily related to 
the budget of the Ministry of Defense. It is clear that the 
means allocated by this draft for material supply are 
insufficient, not to mention any import of or orders for 
equipment, weapons, and spare parts for our defense industry. 
Our military-industrial complex could produce to the tune of 
roughly 10 billion leva. If all you have at your disposal is 
800-900 million leva for aircraft, vessels, artillery, missiles, 
and radar equipment -- what will you do first? Import something 
or commission the local defense industry to produce something? 
It is obvious that the army cannot commission any orders for 
the military-industrial complex. 
  [Spiridonov] Was your attention directed only at the defense 
budget? 
  [Mukhtanov] We also discussed the budget of the "State 
Reserve and Military Stocks" Main Administration. This 
administration has not received what it needed in the last few 
years, either. On the other hand, material supplies whose 
expiry date has been reached have been taken out of the stocks. 
This is a very important state system, which, like all other 
systems, is continuously being destroyed. It would not be able 
to function in the case of a natural disaster. There is an even 
greater danger that it would not be able to function in the face 
of a military threat. In this context the budget suffices only 
for the current maintenance of the warehouses, and the 
expenditure on wages, heating, and telephones. The system needs 
233 million leva just for its maintenance. The draft budget 
allocates 210 million, while the system needs more than 2 
billion leva to restore the most necessary elements. 
  [Spiridonov] The draft budget is not the first sign of the 
military-industrial complex's problems. 
  [Mukhtanov] The idea that was vested in parliament's 
decision of last summer to maintain a state policy on the issue 
of mobilization readiness and the military-industrial complex 
still has no clearly marked dimensions. Soon we will be 
demanding a meeting with the Interdepartmental Council, because 
so far nothing has changed. There are still not enough people 
who could work and analyze the information. The old decisions 
from last summer have not been implemented, no new decisions 
have been made, and the parameters of the military-industrial 
complex have not been outlined. Obviously, a lot of work lies 
ahead. 
  [Spiridonov] The financial means that were allocated are 
insufficient, but, nevertheless, are there no reserves? 
  [Mukhtanov] I implied a certain unused reserve, but let us 
not fully specify it. Most private business is making good 
profits, but so far most of the tax burden has been carried by 
the state structures. Private business remains on the 
sidelines. This business should be charged with commitments to 
our defense and security, because the army also protects the 
interests of those people. We will try to discuss this issue. 
However, we lack practical experience in this sphere. We have 
passed the Tax Administration Bill. Obviously, now the Accounts 
Chamber Bill must be adopted and then mechanisms must be created 
for private business to pay specific customs charges, taxes, and 
other fees. 
  [Spiridonov] Nevertheless, is 800-900 million leva too 
little? 
  [Mukhtanov] There is nowhere a specific budget for the 
defense industry. We are discussing the Defense Ministry 
budget, which is supposed to cover orders for the 
military-industrial complex. When the budget is 800-900 million 
leva, while the needs amount to 17 billion leva, it is 
unthinkable to speak about any orders. Furthermore, the complex 
has military-technical property, which the army needs, but does 
not have any money to purchase it. If the army had the 
necessary budget, both it and the military-industrial complex 
could benefit.

the discussion between President Vaclav Havel and Polish Defense 
Minister Piotr Kolodziejdzyk at Prague Castle today. Both agreed 
that their countries' attitude toward the U.S. plan for

our president voiced his support for the continuation of mutual 
consultations and cooperation in modernizing the armies of the 
two neighboring states. 
  Minister Kolodziejdzyk said that NATO standards should be 
introduced into these armies as soon as possible and that a 
joint approach to a safe Europe should be adopted.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jiri Weigl, head of Prime Minister Vaclav </F>
Klaus's team of advisers: "Havel Versus Klaus, or Mixing Up 
Concepts"] 
  [Text] On 18 January, MLADA FRONTA DNES published an 
article by Tomas Vencalek entitled "Havel Versus Klaus, or a 
Dispute About the Meaning of the State." In it, the author 
engaged in a remarkable discourse on the fundamental differences 
of opinion between our most senior representatives on the 
relationship between the citizen and the state. 
  This article maintains that the president, as an advocate of 
a "consistent civic society," is calling for the establishment 
of higher territorial units and non-profit-making organizations, 
while Vaclav Klaus is an unequivocal advocate of a strong state 
or strong-arm government and manifests his distaste for curbing 
the power of this state in favor of the aforementioned 
institutions. 
  Mr. Vencalek sees a disharmony here between the president's 
"liberal view of the world" and the prime minister's 
unidimensionally social democratic way of thinking, which is, 
however, an apparently intrinsically neoconservative phenomenon 
inasmuch as Reagan and Thatcher considered public-legal 
institutions to be parasites on democracy and limited their 
authority in favor of the state. 
  On the basis of these hypotheses, Mr. Vencalek "exposes" 
neoconservatism as the ideological fellow-traveler of social 
democracy (except for marginal differences in the taxation or 
privatization spheres!!) and contrasts it with "liberalism," 
which does not trust the state. 
  The aforementioned views reflect the author's confusion 
about 
the fundamental ideological approaches to the arrangement of 
society. Only in this way can he place conservative thinking 
alongside social democracy. The essence of the conservative way 
of thinking consists of its emphasis on a clear definition of 
ownership rights with regard to property and on freedom of 
choice for all social entities. In this context, the state is 
also seen as the guarantor of stable and equal rules for 
everyone. The role of the state as the "visible hand" of a 
formless general rule should be minimal, but the role of the 
state as the guarantor and maker of rules is crucial and, from 
this point of view, the requirement for a strong state with 
clearly defined authority, and jurisdiction for the individual 
government levels is absolutely consistent with the requirement 
for a minimal role for the state in the microeconomic sphere. 
The social democratic view of the state runs counter to this. 
  The critical views that, in the discussion on the 
establishment of higher territorial units, warn of the 
consequences of ill-considered decisions in favor of the 
government's ability to guarantee stability and uniformity of 
conditions for implementing ownership rights and the freedom of 
choice for all entities should also be understood in this 
context. 
  It is essential to adopt a similar view of non-profit-making 
organizations. To the conservative admirer of the clear and 
natural order of things, a non-profit-making or public-legal 
organization is an ambiguous entity that makes it difficult to 
clearly divide property into private and public property--that 
is, guaranteed by the generally recognized and supervisory 
representative of the public, the state. If non-profit-making 
organizations are perceived as private entities, which, however, 
enjoy certain, mainly tax, advantages over other profit-making 
private organizations, the only argument a critic can cite here 
is the violation of the universal nature of the rules of 
competition and the possibility that these advantages may be 
abused. 
  It is worse if non-profit-making organizations are viewed as 
a kind of third form of ownership, a form that contradicts both 
private and state ownership. This aspect is gaining in 
importance, first and foremost, in our situation, where 
decisions are being made on the fate of the huge amount of 
property amassed by the former regime. The illusion is being 
fostered among the public that this is a more noble form of 
ownership that does not pursue a profit motive and is not abused 
a priori by a dubious state authority. The impression is being 
created that the state property originally transferred into this 
form will somehow serve "all of us" due to the noble intentions 
of its "public-legal" administrators, that it will be given 
preferential treatment against other entities, and that we, 
citizens, will decide on its use by means of some unspecified 
arrangement for self-organization. In practice, this means 
abandoning the requirement for a clear definition of ownership 
rights and of the responsibility of the owner associated with 
them. 
  This approach to non-profit making organizations, which is 
very vigorous in the ongoing debates on the appropriate 
legislation, expresses a priori the mistrust of Mr. Vencalek's 
"liberals" of private ownership and profit-making motives, which 
is the driving force behind each market economy. It expresses 
the attempt to establish, by a "public-legal" form, capitalism 
with a human face, which preserves at least something of the 
unfavorable aspects of the irresponsible past. 
  It is necessary to understand "liberalism" perceived like 
this more in the U.S. sense, as an ideological trend very close 
to European social democracy. They are both equally distant 
from consistent and conservative thinking. 
  However, I must give Mr. Vencalek his due in one thing. The 
issue discussed by him, albeit poorly interpreted, is a sign 
that our conditions are obviously reaching maturity. It is 
comforting that the differences between the conservative and 
"liberal" or social democratic concepts of society are obvious 
in our policy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by David </F>
Stahlavsky; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [David Stahlavsky] Prime Minister, our 
government, in the process of correcting the wrongs of the past, 
has gone quite far. One problem still remains to be solved: 
compensation to the victims of fascism. You indicated at 
Jachymov that the solution is at hand. How far is the temporal 
horizon of this solution? 
  [Klaus] Naturally, this matter has two components. One 
component is the political sphere: What kind of a signal it is, 
what sort of a decision it is, from both the internal political 
point of view and the foreign political one. The second thing 
is the technical aspect of this compensation. I think that, 
basically, we have gone quite a long way in the technical 
aspect. One indeed has to understand it not as compensation. 
We always translate these words into mitigation of wrongs 
because compensation somehow implies the feeling that something 
is in the ratio of one to one. As to all the restitution and 
rehabilitation claims, they are never in the ratio of one to 
one. We all know this very well. One cannot compensate for one 
minute's stay in a concentration camp by anything. I know this 
very well. That is why we say mitigation of wrongs. That is 
why I also think that it should be [word indistinct], where the 
wrongs were greatest, and it should not apply to the group of 
those in enforced labor who, no doubt, we all consider a smaller 
group, where smaller wrongs were committed. So what we could 
manage from our means on a temporary basis is to do with the 
greatest wrongs. 
  From the internal and foreign political viewpoints, it has 
its important aspect and we are very well aware of it, and I 
repeat and say clearly and distinctly that, from our point of 
view, it does not mean at all diminishing or giving up claims 
toward the German side in these matters. It is simply our own 
personal responsibility toward our fellow citizens who are 
fairly old now, and I do not think one can put it off much 
longer. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Daniel Kunstat: "The Czech Republic Army and </F>
NATO"] 
  [Text] The rapprochement process and the future 
incorporation of the postcommunist countries of Central and East 
Europe into the North Atlantic Alliance has had two fundamental 
aspects since the very beginning. The absolute prerogative was 
and undoubtedly is the willingness (or unwillingness) of the 
Alliance itself to make a strategic decision and intrinsically 
alter the geopolitical constellation in the zone between Germany 
and Russia. The recently approved Partnership for Peace plan, 
however, diverts attention, to a certain extent, to the "other 
end of the court" inasmuch as the possible admission of the 
individual aspirants for NATO membership is conditional upon the 
quality and speed of their domestic reforms and upon stable 
development in the economic, political, and military spheres. 
  The first practical steps within the framework of the 
Partnership plan should be joint military exercises between the 
armed forces of the Visegrad Four countries and NATO, while the 
interested parties will have their own permanent representatives 
in the Alliance's Brussels headquarters. The coming months will 
indeed be a testing time for the "converging" Visegrad Four 
states,because the phase of noncommittal political declarations 
on their readiness "to share in the joint aims and values" will 
be replaced by practical experience, which will establish the 
potential for effective military cooperation. In this 
connection, it is impossible not to ask if our Army is ready for 
close cooperation with the NATO Command. 
  It is no use disguising the fact that the current Czech Army 
is, for all sorts of reasons, the element of political authority 
least affected by the post-November changes and that even the 
various "screenings" have not done much to alter this sad fact. 
It comes as no surprise that it is a, so to speak, superhuman 
task for Defense Minister Baudys to find at least 30 young 
officers with the appropriate education and linguistic ability 
capable of acting as our representatives in the Alliance's 
Command and individual committees. The fact that, since 1989, 
some 170 Czech soldiers have undergone training in the West (at 
the state's expense, of course) and that many of them are now in 
better-paid positions in the private sector completes this 
paradoxical situation. The greatest shortcoming in the 
qualifications of the Czech Army's Command Corps is not so much 
their "technical" expertise but their absolute lack of world 
languages. This is despite the fact that two-thirds of the some 
25,000 officers are university graduates. Unfortunately, it is 
impossible to tell today how many soldiers studied in the former 
Soviet Union because the Defense Ministry's Personnel Department 
does not keep such records. It is certain that, for example, 
the current chief of the General Staff was a very diligent 
student; this is even borne out by his endeavor at two colleges 
in the very womb of the camp of peace and socialism. Jiri 
Nekvasil is obviously the right man for the job and is indeed a 
suitable partner for his "western" colleagues (a mixture of 
former West Point students). 
  The Czech Army is currently going through a very demanding 
and painful structural reorganization process, and the number of 
men at arms should be reduced from 100,000 to 65,000 within two 
years. The fundamental transformation of the General Staff, the 
creation of new logistics (that is, principles for financing the 
troops), and the creation of completely new commands (for 
example, the Tactical Air Force) are all planned in this first 
phase. The concept also envisages the early formation of a 
fully professional Rapid Deployment Brigade of 3,500 men, whose 
equipment will be "compatible" with that of similar units in the 
NATO forces. According to Baudys, this brigade, along with the 
Czech UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] unit, should form the 
basis for our participation in the Partnership for Peace plan 
and, at the same time, act as a kind of precursor of the future 
fully professional Army. 
  It is certainly not news to our political officials that the 
equipment, structure of the forces, and, in view of its 
personnel makeup, the Command Corps are not "compatible" with 
the armed forces of NATO states. Compared with the other 
parties interested in a spot beneath the security umbrella, 
however, this handicap is, in essence, insignificant. After 
all, the Czech Republic's integration into the Euro-Atlantic 
security structures depends, first and foremost, on the 
political decision of the Alliance itself.

<F P=106> [Statement by Croatian Prime Minister Nikita Valentic on the </F>
Slovene-Croatian talks in Ljubljana on 25 January -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] We have just received a report from 
Ljubljana. The Slovene and Croatian delegations had talks this 
afternoon and discussed open questions on their bilateral 
relations. The borders, the Ljubljana bank, and the Krsko 
nuclear power station are significant problems, and no 
sensational results should be expected, it was said before the 
talks. Were any results or progress achieved during the talks? 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Although, judging by the 
statements [before the talks] by the Croatian and Slovene side, 
no concrete results were expected at the talks today in 
Ljubljana -- the general opinion is that the talks, which ended 
just before the news broadcast, were still an important, 
qualitative step forward in resolving existing problems in the 
relations of the two countries. 
  [Valentic] I think that I can agree with Mr. Drnovsek 
[Slovene premier] that a significant step forward was achieved 
today in resolving objective existing problems. 
  In my opinion it is primarily important that both 
governments 
desire as good and as friendly relations between our two 
countries as possible. I can say now that I think that the 
problems are of an objective nature [as heard], they are normal 
occurrences in processes of disassociation, such as was in the 
case of our countries. Our states and our economies are 
complementary to such an extent that there is virtually no 
reason why we should not resolve all issues in the interest of 
both states and peoples. 
  We are talking here about 10 or so agreements that we have 
agreed on to a considerable extent, where we achieved 
significant steps forward, but with some nuances still 
unresolved, but I believe that we shall agree on them as well by 
7 February in Zagreb. 
  It is important to sign all significant agreements, those in 
connection with property belonging to Slovene citizens and 
Slovene companies in Croatia, which we have never called into 
question, and those referring to the settlement of our debt, 
which is not a contentious issue. What is contentious are our 
overall relations when it comes to the Krsko [nuclear power 
plant], because our interests are absolutely mutual, from the 
technological point of view to the security of the plant. 
  We have to a considerable extent, almost completely, 
resolved 
the issue of a trade treaty, because we have to increase our 
trade cooperation because it is in the interest of both states. 
Regardless of the situation in which Croatia has found itself, 
we have been taking significant steps to revive our economy, 
hoping that we shall very soon be able to take a step further -- 
to completely open our borders for trade, as these are 
principles of an open market. 
  Finally, we have agreed that our state commissions should 
begin examining borders at once, because we believe that this is 
something that cannot be postponed. Once again, I would like to 
express my personal conviction, and that of the Croatian 
Government, that we wish normalization when it comes not only to 
these open issues, but we also wish better relations as this is 
what I really deem as being very important for both states.

<F P=106> [Interview with Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic in </F>
Slovenia by an unidentified announcer in Zagreb; from the 
"Slikom na Sliku" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Our Foreign Minister Mate Granic is on 
the phone. Good evening. 
  [Granic] Good evening. 
  [Announcer] We were told that hot, topical issues were 
discussed. What was your impression of today's talks, will 
Croatian-Slovene relations finally begin registering an upward 
trend? 
  [Granic] The atmosphere was very good and I believe that an 
important step forward was made today. I am convinced that 
eight to 10 agreements will be ready for signing on 7 February, 
as agreed. 
  I am particularly convinced that considerable progress had 
been made regarding the resolution of the Krsko [Slovene nuclear 
power plant supplying electricity to Croatia] problem, the 
resolution of the problem concerning the agreement on property, 
and the agreement on the Ljubljana Bank. We presented our 
proposals in these cases and I believe that we now have a 
proximity of views. We will continue the talks and try to solve 
this problem -- one of the major problems -- by 7 February. 
  Agreements on cultural and educational cooperation, trade, 
regular air traffic, the water industry, employment, social 
security, long-term cooperation in the use of the Slovene 
transit gas pipeline, and fishing rights -- all these are ready 
and should be concluded by 7 February. 
  [Announcer] Do the Slovenes reproach us in any way and why 
have there not been such top-level meetings in the past? 
  [Granic] I believe that conditions have now become ripe, 
that 
both sides have realized that to sign all these agreements would 
be extremely beneficial to both countries, and that compromise 
solutions must found in certain areas. 
  [Announcer] Slovenia has much better relations with its 
other 
neighbors than with Croatia, and we have heard recently that 
they fear the Croats the most. What is the reason for this, and 
how do you think this will evolve in future? 
  [Granic] I believe that matters will begin moving in a 
different direction after the signing of these agreements on 7 
February, and that one cannot expect only one side to make 
compromises. Anyway, most of the problems are a consequence of 
the disintegration of former Yugoslavia, and these problems can 
only be resolved through compromise solutions. 
  [Announcer] Today, you also addressed the Council of Europe 
in Strasbourg. Today, you took part in two important events. 
What happened in Strasbourg? 
  [Granic] In Strasbourg I had meetings with all officials of 
the Council of Europe, from Mrs. Lalumiere, the secretary 
general, Parliamentary Assembly President [Miguel Anjel] 
Martinez, to [Gerhard] Reddemann, the Political Affairs 
Committee president, and all other top officials including the 
special envoy for Croatia, Baron Finsberg. 
  I would like to tell you in a few sentences about the gist 
of 
all these meetings: As the main obstacle for the speedy 
admission of Croatia to the Council of Europe they singled out 
the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and obviously problems in 
connection with halting the war and reaching an agreement. I 
think this is the main obstacle, both when it comes to public 
opinion, Europe, and all the problems proceeding from there. 
  They positively assessed Croatia's efforts in the course of 
the latest meetings in Geneva and Brussels, but, in any case, 
they said an agreement between the Muslims and Croats was 
desirable. 
  On the other hand, I can also say that all positively 
assessed the beginning of normalization of relations between the 
Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and 
the signing of the joint declaration as the first step in the 
normalization of the relations, and in this connection they 
expressed their support in very clear terms. 
  They had increasingly fewer remarks for the development of 
democracy in the Republic of Croatia, even though there were 
some remarks in connection with the media, to which I believe 
they received satisfactory replies. 
  [Announcer] I am sorry to interrupt you. Can you tell us in 
more detail what their concrete remarks to this were? 
  [Granic] They were concretely interested to know about the 
issue of Mr. Ivancic [FERAL TRIBUNE editor in chief who was 
called up on 31 December], for whom we said was mobilized as all 
other able-bodied men of his age. On the other hand, if we 
receive an application for compulsory work orders [for him], we 
will in every case support it, and he will be treated as all 
other press editors in the Republic of Croatia. There were some 
remarks in connection with television without any particular 
specifications of problems. I would like to say that there have 
been no major criticisms. 
  [Announcer] So you said that they supported all Croatian 
moves. Then how can you explain that Croatia's guest status to 
the Council of Europe was frozen. 
  [Granic] We should note that some parliamentarians initiated 
a process for the expulsion of Croatia, or for it to be denied 
special guest status. However, the special guest status 
remained; at the level of our bureau it has been frozen for a 
certain period of time, but envoys for Croatia have been 
appointed. I believe, that if we achieve some progress in 
connection with Bosnia-Herzegovina, that the process of 
admitting Croatia as a permanent member to the Council of Europe 
will be immediately resumed. 
  [Announcer] Mr. Granic, thank you very much for being a 
guest 
of the Slikom na Sliku program.

<F P=106> [Report by Petko Koprivica] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Koprivica] No more worries and guessing. The 
republic of Serbian Krajina has a new president. He is 39-year 
old lawyer Milan Martic, a man who embodies dignity, bravery, 
steadiness, firmness, and the freedom-loving spirit of the 
Krajina residents [passage omitted]. Here is his first 
statement in the role of the president of the republic of 
Serbian Krajina: 
  [Martic] I believe that the changes I have promised will be 
experienced very soon because I want capable, intelligent, and 
above all, honorable people to join forces. I know that they 
are everywhere in the republic of Serbian Krajina, in the 
republic of Srpska, and in Serbia, and I know a good many of 
these people wish to help. I am not important, it is these 
people who matter and what we have accomplished thus far. I 
believe that we will succeed in all this and that the republic 
of Serbian Krajina will soon take its place in this unified 
Serbian country. 
  [Koprivica] Do you expect, now that the people have 
expressed their desire that you be the president of the republic 
of Serbian Krajina, that the negative tendencies in this region 
created over the last year or two will subside and the people 
will turn to real issues such as defense, reconstruction, and 
finally, the merging of Krajina with its core, Serbia? 
  [Martic] I am firmly convinced that this will be the case. 
Personally, I am not one to bear a grudge. Those people who 
have perhaps been misled and deceived by something that was not 
true and had no grounds, will finally understand. I believe 
that we will all very soon tackle these common goals. All the 
current negative tendencies will soon disappear and the people 
who might have been misled will understand. I am convinced that 
this program must succeed. 
  [Koprivica] It goes without saying that the residents of the 
republic of Serbian Krajina, with the election of Milan Martic 
as president, have won another great and historic victory that 
should at the same time be understood as a message to the world 
that not a single inch of the present territory of this most 
western Serbian land will ever again, under any circumstances, 
be part of Croatia.

  [Text] A delegation of the Croatian parliament, led by 
deputy speaker Zarko Domljan, is to take part today in the 
proceedings of the parliamentary session of the Council of 
Europe. The situation in the former Yugoslavia will be 
discussed on the basis of the introductory speech by Thorvald 
Stoltenberg, one of the cochairmen of the Geneva conference. 
  The office of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of 
Europe yesterday made a decision to freeze Croatia's current 
status until further notice. This means that the decision to 
remove its status as a special guest was not implemented, but 
also that the procedure to receive Croatia as a full member of 
the Council of Europe has been suspended. 
  Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic warned at the European 
Parliament in Strasbourg of negative consequences of a possible 
withdrawal of the UN units from Bosnia-Herzegovina and demanded 
a wider mandate for the world organization's forces in 
establishing peace. We support all decisions of the NATO 
alliance and humanitarian activities by the United Nations, 
Granic said and added that Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina upholds 
humanitarian activities. 
  Granic stressed that there are no units of the Republic of 
Croatia in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but that there are volunteers 
within the Croatian Defense Council [HVO], underlining that 
there are volunteers from many European countries in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The Croatian foreign minister expressed support for the 
continuation of the peace negotiations in Geneva, where pressure 
should be intensified on the parties in the negotiations to sign 
a peace agreement.

  [Text] A Croatian Government delegation led by Croatian 
Prime Minister Nikica Valentic visited Slovenia today. It 
discussed acute mutual problems with our government 
representatives. After the talks both prime ministers --- 
Valentic and Drnovsek -- held a news conference in the presence 
of foreign ministers Granic and Peterle. Tomaz Gerden reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Gerden] The first talks following a long 
freeze in relations have not, as it was also expected, brought 
any significant changes and progress. Despite this, today's 
meeting was according to Mr. Valentic nevertheless important. 
The Croatian Government will strive for the best possible, 
friendly relations. The trade is particularly important as the 
economies of both countries complement each other and poor 
relations harm Slovenia as well as Croatia. Prime Minister 
Valentic also mentioned the problem of the Krsko nuclear power 
plant. Croatia does not disavow the debt, he said. It hopes to 
pay one-third of it in the coming days and the rest gradually, 
and through compensations in kind if this proves suitable to 
both sides, until 1 August, when property relations are also 
supposed to be resolved. 
  Croatia considers the Ljubljanska Banka's debt to several 
hundreds of thousands of Croatian savers particularly pressing. 
Our neighbors will respect Slovene property in Croatia. 
Regarding holiday resorts, especially issues concerning land, 
they will negotiate in commissions. Dr. Drnovsek assessed 
today's talks as follows: 
  [Drnovsek] The talks were very intense and very concrete. 
We discussed all open issues between the two countries and 
singled out the most important ones. We started with the issue 
of the Krsko nuclear power plant; we discussed economic 
relations between the countries and efforts to sign an economic 
agreement that will also regulate the methods of payment in the 
shortest possible time. Both sides are interested in switching 
over to free trade in the next phase as quickly as possible, in 
much the same way that Slovenia has already agreed with some 
other countries. 
  [Gerden] They did not discuss drawing of borders separately. 
Minister Peterle particularly stressed that joint ownership over 
Piran Bay is not acceptable for Slovenia. A mixed commission 
will discuss borders on 15 February. On 7 February the 
governments are expected to meet again. The last date for the 
regulation of trade and legal-property issues is 1 August. The 
ministries of both sides will prepare their proposals in a month. 
  Today's meeting of both prime ministers, therefore, 
reanimated the stalled talks between the two countries. [end

arrive in Slovenia on Thursday [27 January]. We have learned 
that Zhirinovskiy has officially applied for the entry visa, 
which he will also be granted. For the time being it is not 
known whether the Slovene politicians have coordinated their 
views about this visit. In connection with the claim that 
Zhirinovskiy has allegedly sent a letter to some Slovene 
political institutions informing them of the visit, the Foreign 
Ministry says that this is not the case and that the Foreign 
Ministry has received no such letter. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy is 
expected to remain in Slovenia until 1 February. He will be 
staying in Bled where he will be joined by sympathizers from all 
over Europe.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, Jan 25 (TANJUG) -- Branko Brankovic, 
ambassador at the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry, Tuesday [25 
January] said that the investigation into malversations 
committed by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] members had 
political, in addition to moral, aspects, as some U.N. force 
members had organized arms smuggling into Bosnia-Herzegovina in 
spite of the U.N. embargo on arms deliveries to the former 
Yugoslavia. This arms smuggling has helped Moslems arm 
themselves, Brankovic told Radio Yugoslavia. Brankovic also 
recalled that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had warned on 
time that someone within the UNPROFOR was involved in secreat 
arms deliveries to the Moslem forces in the civil war-torn 
former Yugoslav Republic. 
  After several months of investigtion, a special U.N. 
commission proved that some UNPROFOR members were involved in 
illegal traffic in fuel, passes for departure from the Moslem 
part of Sarajevo and stolen goods, as well as in prostitution. 
Brankovic said it was good to have the U.N secretary general 
order the investigation, as it has proved that only a small part 
of the UNPROFOR and not the entire force was involved in illegal 
activities. 
  Truths which had been hidden from the public for a long time 
are now being unveiled, as proved by the interview given by the 
former UNPROFOR Commander in Bosnia General Francis Briquemont 
to the WASHINGTON POST, unequivocally stating that only Bosnian 
Serbs abide by their commitments, Brankovic said. Without any 
doubt in many cases, UNPROFOR had been presenting to relevant 
U.N. bodies true reports on what was happening in the field in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, these reports were placed ad acta 
or passed over in silence, whether in UPROFOR headquarters in 
Zagreb or New York, Brankovic said. 
  It is to be expected that UNPROFOR reports will from now on 
get the green light on time, i.e. that the international public 
opinion will be informed of them, Ambassador Brankovic said.

<F P=106> [Report by M. Antic: "Number of Persons Fallen Ill Growing"] </F>
  [Text] Pristina -- The number of persons fallen ill with 
typhoid fever [trebusni tifus] in Stimlje in Kosovo-Metohija is 
growing daily. The number of diseased yesterday climbed to 28 
and, according to Dr. Komnen Tmusic, director of the Institute 
for Protection of Health, we should expect a further increase in 
the number of patients in the coming days as it has transpired 
that the incubation period lasts longer than the usual two to 
three weeks. It appears that the incubation period in this case 
can even last up to 42 days, since the first persons to have 
fallen ill appeared at the beginning of December. 
  The life of none of the patients is endangered for the time 
being as they have received the necessary medical assistance. 
The source of the epidemic (a well in the Center for the 
Mentally Retarded in Stimlje) has also been sanitized. The 
employees and protegees of this center are now receiving water 
from water tankers. The physicians warn that the residents of 
Stimlje should avoid contacts with the families of persons who 
have fallen ill. 
  Yesterday, Dr. Tmusic warned that the epidemiologic 
situation 
in the province, especially in larger settlements, is very 
grave. Because of dirt in the towns and heaps of rubbish that 
nobody clears away in Pristina and in other towns, the number of 
rats has increased, as well as the number of stray dogs, among 
which some are also infected with rabies. He said that 
municipal governments and incumbent organs have been informed of 
all this, but that for the time being nobody is doing anything.

  [Excerpt] Today's plenary session of the People's Assembly 
opened with the approval of the statement on the Partnership for 
Peace [PFP], which was read by Deputy Petrika Minga in the name 
of the Foreign Affairs Commission. 
  After greeting the PFP initiative of the U.S. Government and 
of President Clinton in person, the statement expresses the 
unreserved support of the People's Assembly of the Republic of 
Albania toward this initiative, which serves peace and stability 
in Europe and beyond. 
  The statements says that Albania manifests its readiness to 
be a partner to this initiative, with the conviction that our 
country has the opportunities and will fulfill partnership 
conditions. With the establishment of democracy, through its 
government, Albania has requested full membership in NATO, 
assessing this as its desire and need, but also as a concrete 
step in contributing to peace in the turbulent Balkan region. 
  The statement further stresses that we are convinced that 
the 
PFP consensus brings us closer to NATO entities and enables our 
membership in this pact. Knowing its obligations toward this 
partnership, Albania will always rely on the principles of 
democracy and the full respect for human rights and freedoms and 
the law- governed state. 
  After voting, the statement was approved unanimously by the 
deputies present. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Correspondent's report: "Hungarian-Serbian Relations Could </F>
Improve -- The Chairman of the Democratic Union of Vojvodina 
Hungarians Will Also Participate in the Belgrade Talks"] 
  [Text] Prior to his upcoming visit to Belgrade, Hungarian 
Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky received the chairman and 
deputy chairman of the Democratic Association of Serbs in 
Hungary, Milan Nedeljkov and Petar Lastic. 
  After the talks, Geza Jeszenszky said that he was glad to 
learn that the Serbs in Hungary do not have complaints that 
could hinder long-term Hungarian-Serbian cooperation. They 
agreed that settling the Yugoslav crisis is in the interest of 
both countries. 
  Jeszenszky expressed the hope that the obstacles hindering 
Hungarian-Serbian relations would disappear. He said it was 
important that the Serbs in Hungary had no problems in having 
contacts with the mother country despite the international 
embargo on Rump Yugoslavia. According to Jeszenszky, lifting 
the sanctions is in the interest of both Hungarians and the 
international community. Hungary has always urged peace and a 
just solution. 
  Answering a question put by NEPSZABADSAG, Geza Jeszenszky 
expressed his hope that his visit in Belgrade could contribute 
to easing the rather cold Hungarian-Serbian relations of recent 
years and to moving away from the deadlock. Jeszenszky hopes 
that, after the visit, the Serbian press will present an image 
of Hungarian politics that is closer to reality and is able to 
dissipate the prejudices and misconceptions.

  [Text] The Hungarian foreign minister will travel to 
Yugoslavia today. Prior to his talks, he gave an interview to 
MAGYAR SZO, the paper of Vojvodina Hungarians. Arpad Madarasz 
reports from Novi Sad. 
  [Madarasz] It is a fundamental interest of the two 
neighboring peoples to live in peace and good-neighborliness 
with each other, the Hungarian foreign minister told the Novi 
Sad paper MAGYAR SZO. Geza Jeszenszky stressed that Hungary 
wishes to have friendly relations with every southern Slav 
people, and from the beginning of the crisis it has been 
striving to establish well balanced ties with each successor 
state of the disintegrating Yugoslavia. 
  First of all, I would like to see and experience personally 
how people live in Yugoslavia today and how it feels to be a 
Hungarian in Vojvodina, said Jeszenszky. He added that he does 
not expect spectacular results from the visit and talks. 
However, he expects us to confirm that it is our mutual 
determination to improve interstate ties gradually, step by 
step, taking the possibilities into consideration, to restore 
confidence. 
  The Hungarian Government supports the autonomy concept of 
the 
Democratic Community of Hungarians in Vojvodina [VMDK], but it 
does not regard it as its task to discuss this with the Yugoslav 
Government, Geza Jeszenszky pointed out. However, he said he is 
pleased to learn that President Milosevic has invited [VMDK 
leader] Andras Agoston to attend the talks.

<F P=106> [Interview with unnamed intelligence "expert" by Attila </F>
Schmidt; place and date not given: "The KGB Is Strong and the 
CIA Is Rich -- There Were No Star Wars in Hungary"] 
  [Text] Irrespective of their social order, it is extremely 
important for every country to have a firm economic background, 
and this can also be seen from their military potential. 
However, well- founded political, and mainly economic, 
decisions require the knowledge of at least the plans, concepts, 
and expected decisions of partner countries. This information 
can be obtained openly through the press and foreign 
representations; however, the intelligence services have to be 
activated for the secret information; the intelligence services 
will uncover the plans of the other side with the help of agents 
and other secret means. 
  No country can avoid the struggle of intelligence services, 
including Hungary. We spoke about this secret struggle with an 
expert who does not wish to be named. 
  [Expert] Intelligence is divided into civil and military 
sectors. Most medium-sized and smaller countries only have 
military intelligence services. Of course, this does not mean 
that these countries would give up the possibility to obtain 
political, economic, and other information. They put the 
military intelligence in charge of obtaining such information. 
The intelligence services of the former Eastern Bloc were 
organized according to the Soviet KGB model and, thus, a 
military intelligence was also in operation in addition to a 
civilian intelligence service. 
  [Schmidt] Does that mean that this duality stopped after the 
change in the regime? 
  [Expert] No; only their names changed: They are active as 
military and civilian information offices. The same applies to 
the former partner countries. 
  [Schmidt] In the past decades, the CIA and the KGB became 
known as the big "warriors." What was the difference between 
the two organizations? 
  [Expert] The essential difference was that while the CIA is 
an intelligence agency, only Group III/I in the KGB dealt with 
intelligence gathering, Group III/II dealt with 
counterespionage, and Group III/III (also famous in Hungary) 
dealt with domestic surveillance. In the United States, 
counterespionage belongs to the FBI. 
  [Schmidt] Which organization was "better," the CIA or the 
KGB? 
  [Expert] It is impossible to give a clear answer to this 
question because, while there was no internal competition within 
the KGB because the entire organization was directed by a single 
boss, there is constant rivalry between the CIA and the FBI 
because each organization is led by a different boss and they 
have to prove their importance. Thus, the KGB was strong, but 
the CIA is much richer. However, it is a fact that both 
organizations carried out a global and total intelligence 
activity; they were present all over the world and they were 
interested in everything. As the sole major intelligence power 
of the world, the CIA has not changed its style these days 
either. 
  [Schmidt] What information did the big intelligence agencies 
want from Hungary? 
  [Expert] A separate department in the CIA dealt with the 
Eastern Bloc countries. They were interested in these 
countries' political and economic concepts, and they were also 
interested in knowing the situation of the domestic opposition. 
Naturally, they dealt specially with the main enemy, the Soviet 
Union. One of the well-tested means of this struggle was to 
force them into an arms race that involved huge amounts of 
money. With Star Wars, they forced the Soviets to carry out new 
military investments. 
  [Schmidt] What tactics did they use against Hungary? 
  [Expert] They could not influence us militarily because, 
compared with the others, we had an "operetta army." Therefore, 
we were "granted" an almost unlimited amount of credit. Our 
indebtedness also "derives" from certain intelligence maneuvers. 
This required that politicians should not be able to resist 
temptation. 
  [Schmidt] What intelligence organizations were active in 
Hungary? 
  [Expert] The Americans, the West Germans, the British, the 
French, and the Italians. However, Hungary was not only 
interesting to the Western intelligence services. Austria was, 
at that time, already the most friendly country in our 
neighborhood because the Romanians spied very actively against 
us, but the East Germans and the Czechoslovaks were also present 
in Hungary. 
  [Schmidt] What is the situation today? 
  [Expert] The East Germans have probably stopped their spying 
activity in Hungary....

<F P=106> [Interview with economic experts of the Hungarian Socialist </F>
Party, the Alliance of Free Democrats, and the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum, by Henrik Hammang and Sara Szeli; place and 
date not given: "Party Views on Key Economic Issues -- The Owner 
Is the Main Actor"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] 
<H3>  Laszlo Pal: The MSZP Does 
Not Promise Immediate Prosperity </H3>
  [PESTI HIRLAP] If the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] gets 
into a government position, what possibilities do you see of 
preserving the value of welfare spending and pensions? 
  [Pal] In the coming period, our party is preparing for 
crisis management, because the decreased gross national product, 
the negative processes in foreign trade and agriculture, the 
very high deficit of the balance of payments, and the domestic 
budget deficit all point to a very difficult next period, 
whoever is in government. In our view, it is at the end of 1995 
or the beginning of 1996 when a stable situation can turn into 
an economic upswing, providing that we have a balancing economic 
policy. I am talking about balancing because, all at the same 
time, we have to ensure that inflation does not suddenly 
increase, the balance of payments does not get into a much worse 
situation, social tensions do not increase more than bearable, 
and unemployment does not again start to increase, while the 
country becomes competitive thus ensuring economic growth. 
  Naturally, in the current situation, without any basis, the 
MSZP cannot promise higher welfare spending or an immediate 
improvement in living standards. We feel that the essence of 
our politics manifests itself in the fact that we want to 
establish a much more equitable process in the distribution of 
the social product. Even in this period of crisis management, 
we must restrain the polarization of the population, the 
extremely rapid impoverishment of certain strata of society, and 
the increasing uncertainty of the middle classes. We have said, 
many times, that the reform of state administration cannot be 
delayed. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Attila Karoly Soos: Privatization With Foreign Capital </H5>
  [PESTI HIRLAP] If the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] 
gets into government after the elections, how do you plan to 
solve the stability of pensions and keep them in line with with 
inflation? 
  [Soos] The SZDSZ's economic program, in which we seek 
answers to important social policy questions, has been drawn up, 
but the National Council has not yet discussed it. Regarding 
pensions, two major problems have to be taken into 
consideration. The first is handling the position of 
pensioners. In our view, we must adhere strictly to the 
provision in the law that prescribes that pensions have to be 
adjusted to the average wages. As for the future of the pension 
system, a general minimum has to be ensured that facilitates 
decent living standards for elderly people. People who do not 
receive enough for this from the social security fund will have 
to have their monthly income supplemented from the state budget. 
[passage omitted] 
  [PESTI HIRLAP] Would the SZDSZ increase or decrease the 
amount of tax payable if it changes the tax system? 
  [Soos] As an option, we want to introduce the lump sum tax 
in retail trade and services that functioned well in the past. 
This would reduce administration. It makes the speculation of 
expenses unnecessary. According to our surveys, this form of 
taxation is very popular with the entrepreneurs. This would 
retrieve the tax lost through abolishing the minimum tax in a 
way that is voluntarily chosen. Therefore, our proposal to 
reduce taxes also takes the not- too-rosy budget situation into 
consideration. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Gyula Takacsy: The Future Belongs to Private Ownership </H5>
  [PESTI HIRLAP] The Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] is the 
biggest party of the current government coalition. Which tax 
laws would you change after the 1994 elections? 
  [Takacsy] Hungary is in the process of major changes. In 
1988, a new tax system was drawn up that resulted in a 
tremendously increased number of enterprises, together with 
incomes from the gray and black economies, which are not taxed. 
These have to be terminated. A very long time is needed for us 
to reach the level of stability that exists in Germany for 
example, where tax discipline and control are highly developed. 
When this is achieved, we can start thinking about abolishing 
the minimum tax, which is a necessary evil in the current 
situation. Realistically, we can think about a slow lowering of 
taxes and making taxation more balanced. We can mainly expect 
the reduction of company tax, which is a revenue type tax. I 
cannot foresee the reduction of taxes linked to turnover. 
[passage omitted] Naturally, it is a very important part of 
our program that we do not plan radical tax decreases, rather, 
we say that balance can basically be restored through launching 
growth. [passage omitted] 
  [PESTI HIRLAP] To what extent would you be able to reduce 
the country's foreign debts in the coming four years? 
  [Takacsy] I do not think that this is our most important 
task; at the moment, the Hungarian economy is in a situation in 
which it has to draw on foreign resources because we have too 
little capital, which is necessary for development. In my view, 
the debt has to be managed rather than reduced, which 
essentially means that the repayment of capital amounts can be 
resolved through taking on new loans, which, in a favorable 
case, changes the structure of loans, namely turns into 
longer-term loans, and the interest payments will have to be 
born out of the Hungarian economy's current balance of payments. 
In my view, this is not our primary task, because there are 
very many indebted countries in the world, including the United 
States. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Romanian Defense Minister Niculae Spiroiu by </F>
Ryszard Malik; place and date not given: "Politics Is Decided 
by the Strongest"] 
  [Text] [Malik] The "Partnership for Peace" initiative -- a 
program for all former communist countries proposed by NATO in 
Brussels -- does not fully satisfy the Poles. As you probably 
know, Poland had its own vision of a future security structure 
in Europe. How does Romania assess the "Partnership for Peace" 
plan? 
  [Spiroiu] I think the NATO proposal is a good resolution for 
our part of Europe, for all countries of the former communist 
bloc. It does not single out or discriminate against anyone, 
and, first of all, it does not draw any new borders or a new 
geopolitical divisions within Europe. The Romanian Army seeks 
integration with NATO. This is in line with our foreign policy, 
the key goal of which is the preservation of peace and stability 
in the region. I would like to stress that all political forces 
agree on this. Romania is not interested in conflicts with any 
country. On the contrary, it longs to see peace in the Balkans, 
in the former Yugoslavia. I would like to remind everyone that 
due to the embargo imposed on our exports to the new Yugoslavia, 
our state loses millions of dollars annually. Romania 
understands, however, that there is no other way to achieve 
peace in the former Yugoslavia than through dialogue. Despite 
great losses endured through support for such policy, Romania 
will not break free from the group of countries observing these 
sanctions. 
  I suppose, however, that the "Partnership for Peace" in its 
current form does not satisfy all countries or meet all their 
expectations -- particularly in Poland, the Czech Republic, and 
Hungary. I understand that, for example, German policy seeks to 
move NATO's borders farther to eastward. However, what might be 
good for Germany does not mean that it could meet the 
expectations of all Central and East European countries. 
Romania speaks out for the creation of a security structure 
throughout Europe that would eliminate the fear of new conflicts 
and treat all states on an equal footing, without any privileges. 
  [Malik] At the same time, you support Russia's position, 
which blocked Poland's admission to NATO.... 
  [Spiroiu] I also understand Russian fears of NATO expansion 
with new members. Such an outcome would serve all those who 
oppose the continuation of the democratic process in Russia 
begun by President Boris Yeltsin, all conservative and 
pro-imperialist forces. It would be grist for the mill of such 
people as Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. In this situation, 
"Partnership for Peace" is the optimal but not the final 
solution. It is also a good endeavor for another reason -- it 
coincides with the period of transformation that our part of 
Europe is now experiencing, and the changes in NATO which is 
trying to find a place for itself after the end of the Cold War. 
  [Malik] Prior to the NATO meeting in January, President Ion 
Iliescu criticized the proposal of joint guarantees for Central 
and East European countries provided by the Americans and 
Russians. Do you not think that such guarantees would actually 
mean a new Yalta? 
  [Spiroiu] I will respond briefly: Politics is decided by the 
strongest. 
  [Malik] Over recent years, Romania, like other countries of 
the former communist bloc, has changed its foreign and defense 
policies. What changes have occurred in the Army? 
  [Spiroiu] Following the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the 
socialist bloc, we began to adjust the Army to meet the new 
situation. Under the agreement on conventional armed forces, 
the Romanian Army can retain the maximum number of 230,000 
servicemen. We predict that in the future it will be an Army 
based on professional soldiers to a great extent. "Partnership 
for Peace" meets our expectations and as it confirms the 
expediency of the covered course concerning the reorganization 
of the Army. The aim of this reorganization was to adjust our 
military structures to West European standards, particularly to 
NATO structures. 
  [Malik] Polish-Romanian relations are not assessed as very 
good, and I became convinced of this during a visit of mine to 
Bucharest. How does military cooperation look against this 
backdrop? 
  [Spiroiu] Good and friendly relations have existed between 
Romanian and Polish citizens, as well as between our states, 
throughout history. Over the last two years, we have begun the 
restoration of the ties we severed after the changes in both 
countries. I believe that our armies should also have good 
relations. I am saying with regret, however, that currently 
there is no closer cooperation despite a number of initiatives 
undertaken since 1991. Some unforeseen circumstances have 
always hampered the conclusion of such an agreement, for 
example, the replacement of the Polish defense minister, and 
last year's elections in Poland. I hope that a relevant 
agreement will be signed shortly.

  [Excerpts] The Central Executive Bureau of the PDSR 
[Social Democracy Party of Romania] held a meeting yesterday, 
which was attended by Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, other 
ministers, and PDSR members. [passage omitted] 
  At the end of the meeting, PDSR President Adrian Nastase 
made 
a brief statement to the press. He mentioned that discussions 
regarding the negotiations with the parties that form the 
majority in parliament were very heated. After four hours, the 
Central Executive Bureau unanimously approved the formula of a 
coalition government open to all parties that belong to the 
current parliamentary majority. Adrian Nastase said that this 
act should be preceded by the preparation of a draft political 
pact open to all parties, as well as a political understanding 
between all five parties -- namely the PDSR, PUNR [Romanian 
National Unity Party], the PRM [Greater Romania Party], the PSM 
[Socialist Party of Labor], and the PDAR [Romanian Democratic 
Agrarian Party]. 
  Likewise, Adrian Nastase mentioned that it is necessary to 
achieve a consensus on an anticrisis and anti-inflation program. 
After its drafting, consultations will continue with a view to 
setting up a parliamentary coalition government by 1 March. 
  Mr. Adrian Nastase also expressed his surprise that these 
elements discussed with the aforementioned parties on 21 January 
in the evening were not taken into consideration at the meeting 
of the PUNR National Council. Mr. Adrian Nastase also stressed 
that the Central Executive Bureau wants to reaffirm the 
willingness of the PDSR for a political dialogue with the 
parliamentary parties in the opposition, noting that this 
dialogue might take place at the end of the next week. 
  Referring to the memorandum convened between the Romanian 
Government and the IMF, Mr. Nastase informed the correspondents 
present that the participants in the meeting of the Central 
Executive Bureau agreed unanimously that it is necessary for the 
parliament to adopt a declaration in which it expresses support 
for this memorandum as soon as possible.

  [Text] The labor conflict begun by the Rovinari Federation 
of Free Trade Unions has spread, practically speaking, 
throughout the coal mining region administered by the Targu Jiu 
Autonomous Lignite Public Corporation, our correspondent Titus 
Stoichitoiu reports. Over 65,000 employees have stopped work, 
the only departments still functioning being those that 
transport personnel inside the pits and deliver coal to the 
population. 
  Another warning strike and a rally was announced today by 
employees of the Targu Jiu [mining equipment] Repair Plant. 
Similarly, the Lignite Mining Trade Union Confederation, which 
is affiliated to the union confederation headed by Miron Cosma 
[union leader of the Jiu Valley miners], requested permission to 
organize a rally at Rovinari, but the local police and mayor's 
office refused, suggesting that it should be postponed until 
after the general strike in the region.

  [Text] Virgil Magureanu, director of the SRI [Romanian 
Intelligence Service], has been to Beijing, China over the past 
week. Being there at the invitation of China's public security 
minister, Magureanu held a series of talks with representatives 
of the Chinese intelligence service aimed at sharing information 
gathered by the two intelligence services in an effort to combat 
drug trafficking. 
  Another goal of the visit is related to the fact that since 
1989 Romania, like other Eastern European countries, has been 
facing a crime wave in which Asians are also involved and some 
of these violations could also threaten Romania's national 
security. 
  The SRI director, carrying a (black) Romanian diplomatic 
passport, left for Beijing on a TAROM [Romanian national 
airline] charter flight.

<F P=106> [Ion Cristoiu editorial: "A Scandal That Cannot Be Ignored"] </F>
  [Text] The last issue of the weekly ROMANIA MARE devotes 
almost a whole page to an article entitled: "The Establishment 
and Functioning of an Organized Group, Under the Direction of 
Certain Foreign Secret Services, That Penetrated High Official 
Positions." Such a title is not surprising in the least for the 
magazine headed by [Greater Romania Party President] Corneliu 
Vadim Tudor. As one can see, the paper expresses the obsession 
of Corneliu Vadim Tudor, Ilie Neacsu, and other native 
nationalist-communists who see everywhere smaller or bigger 
spies that have come to Romania from all parts of the world, by 
ship or by plane, to be discovered and seized by our brave and 
well-fed patriots. In this respect it is easy to notice that 
the title strikingly reminds us of the reports devoted by the 
SCINTEIA [official organ of the former Romanian Communist Party] 
of the fifties to the trials of "certain saboteurs, spies, and 
agents of English-U.S. imperialism." 
  Under this sign of the Stalinist spy-game that disappeared 
in 
the early days of the Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej [first Romanian 
post-war leader] regime and reappeared and is flourishing in the 
Iliescu regime, the ROMANIA MARE weekly accuses some of the 
current state officials of being spies. The respective 
officials are the following: Adrian Nastase, president of the 
Chamber of Deputies and executive president of the ruling party 
[Social Democracy Party of Romania]; Minister of State Dan 
Mircea Popescu; Ioan Mircea Pascu, secretary of state at the 
Ministry of National Defense; and Ioan Talpes, head of the SIE 
[Foreign Intelligence Service]. Together with others, the 
aforementioned persons are revealed as belonging to an organized 
group that has infiltrated the structures of our country's 
leadership in order to promote the policy and interests of 
foreign powers. In the Romanian press that appeared after the 
1989 December revolution, many stupid things were published on 
the issue of certain public figures having been members of 
various spy networks that were established in Romania. 
Unfortunately, the so-called revelations have not appeared only 
in the pages of the nationalist-communist press, but also in the 
pages of the independent press. Therefore, without any proof, 
the members of the leadership and of the opposition were accused 
of being members of the CIA, KGB, and Mossad. At first glance, 
the ROMANIA MARE article should be counted as another proof of 
journalistic dilettantism, seriously influenced by the cheap 
thrillers read by their authors. That is how, I believe, the 
officials accused by ROMANIA MARE viewed the respective article, 
because, although quite some time has passed since the 
publication of that article, they still keep silent and pretend 
that nothing has happened. I believe that this position of 
ignoring things adopted by the respective personalities is 
erroneous. The scandal has much greater proportions than what 
the accused ones believe or allow to be believed. The 
respective article was not published in just any publication, 
but in the weekly whose owner and director is the leader of a 
party that is part of the government coalition. Had the 
accusation come from the opposition or independent press, there 
would be no need to notice it. It has already become a nervous 
tic of Corneliu Vadim Tudor to denounce the opposition and the 
independent press as being full of English and U.S. spies. 
However, the article is talking about members of the current 
leadership. And this leadership makes a great fuss about the 
issue of the fierce battle that it wages to defend the 
independence and sovereignty of the country. Within this 
context, the denunciation by the Greater Romania Party leader 
(that is, the leader of a party that is a member of the 
government coalition) of an espionage network that penetrated 
the leadership, at such a high level of the government, Chamber 
of Deputies, the Romanian Foreign Intelligence Service, and the 
Army should provoke a rapid and firm stance by those who are 
involved and the respective institutions that are in charge of 
watching over national security. Needless to say that had a 
foreign espionage network penetrated the structures of our 
leadership, that would be one of the most serious attempts 
against the sovereignty and independence of our country. The 
stand of those public figures should make things clear to the 
public. Either what Corneliu Vadim Todor published in the 
ROMANIA MARE weekly is true, and in that case the accused 
persons should not only be urgently removed from office but also 
brought to justice, or the accusations included in the 
respective article are completely erroneous, and in that case, 
the Social Democracy Party of Romania and Ion Iliescu must 
definitively break the alliance with Corneliu Vadim Tudor. The 
act of launching false accusations against high officials of the 
state proves the completely irresponsible attitude of the PRM 
leader. And the presence of such an irresponsible person in the 
structures of the country's leadership -- thanks to the alliance 
with the PDSR and thanks to Ion Iliescu -- is just as serious an 
attempt on the national security as the existence of an 
espionage network that penetrated Romania's top leadership.

  [Text] Belgrade, 27 January (TANJUG) -- The foreign 
ministers of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Hungary, 
Vladislav Jovanovic and Geza Jeszensky, today spoke in favor of 
resuming contacts and goodneighborly cooperation. 
  "I have always valued goodneighborly relations. I hope that 
despite the current situation it will be possible to improve 
Yugoslav-Hungarian relations," Geza Jeszensky said at Belgrade 
airport upon his arrival from Budapest at the start of a two-day 
official visit to the FRY. 
  The Hungarian foreign minister said that conditions for 
cooperation had changed over the last few years but went on to 
express hope that there was scope for improving relations, 
especially in the humanitarian sphere, despite changed 
circumstances. In this context he described Vojvodina 
Hungarians as a "bridge for cooperation" and said that there was 
an opportunity currently for them to remain so. 
  Federal Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic said that he 
expected good results in Yugoslav-Hungarian talks but noted that 
it remained to be seen what could be objectively achieved. He 
added that now was the right moment to renew talks and contacts.

  [Excerpt] The Serbian assembly has been holding a 
consultative session for three days and yet the chairman of the 
assembly has not been elected, not even in the morning part of 
the session. The assembly is currently in recess until 1600 
[1500 GMT] so that the heads of the deputy caucuses can reach an 
agreement. Srdjan Savic reports: 
  [Savic] At the beginning of the session, chairman Vojislav 
Dimitrijevic told deputies that he had received a new nomination 
only from the Socialist Party of Serbia for the post of the 
chairman of the assembly. The party's new candidate is Dragan 
Tomic, head of the party's deputy caucus. 
  Vuk Draskovic, president of the Serbian Renewal Movement, 
explained why DEPOS [Democratic Movement of Serbia] had not 
proposed its new candidate today. He said that the parliament's 
left and right parties' attempts to outvote one another were in 
vain, and that it was necessary to reach a political agreement 
on the division of responsibility for the legislative, 
executive, and judiciary authorities. The Socialists bear the 
greatest responsible for all compromises and agreements, because 
they are the first party on the political ladder, Draskovic 
said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Janos Vekas, deputy chairman of the </F>
Democratic Union of Hungarians in Vojvodina, by Geza Mucsi; 
place and date not given: "Janos Vekas on Aid to Vojvodina"] 
  [Text] Hungary intensively aids Vojvodina. 
Apparently, problems do exist; Janos Vekas will speak about 
these. 
  [Vekas] We are trying to function in the Vojvodina Hungarian 
community as if the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Vojvodina 
[VMDK] and the VMDK-member local government deputies formed some 
kind of national minority parliament. Even now, this body can 
be said to be pluralist: It includes everyone from the 
Christian democrats to the social democrats, even the socialists 
(but not socialists like the ones sitting in the Serbian 
Parliament), and the various ideological platforms. We have 
many differences, but we are held together by one fact, namely 
that we want autonomy. The VMDK's national board can be seen as 
an executive body, and we feel that our mandate obliges us to 
deal with all issues affecting the situation of the Vojvodina 
Hungarians. This is the reason we established the operative 
organizations that can fulfill certain tasks, and this is how 
the Vox Humana was established. Naturally, this organization 
deals with humanitarian aid. At the moment, this is the only 
reliable organization. However, we think that problems are 
arising that affect both the professional and the political 
aspects of aid. We would like to find out what proportion of 
the aid that is collected under the heading of helping the 
Vojvodina Hungarians actually reaches them. 
  [Mucsi] What about international aid? 
  [Vekas] We do not receive anything from the big 
international aid organizations. The distribution of this aid 
is largely done against us, regardless of what the intent of the 
international aid organizations is. The European Union [EU] 
clearly intends the aid for the refugees and for those families 
who host or support refugees. What happens in practice is that, 
for example in Temerin, the Hungarians can see the Serbs line up 
at the town hall and take away the bacon. Hungarians in 
Vojvodina are in a very delicate situation. If they, for 
example the Hungarians in Zenta [Senta], conditionally accept 
that they are hosting so-called refugees, then they can get 
EU-aid, but this also means forced settlement in the Vojvodina, 
or they exclude themselves from the aid. We have told this to 
European leaders. 
  [Mucsi] What was the reaction to this? 
  [Vekas] We did not get a direct and clear answer to this 
question. We collect what we can in the West through our own 
resources, but this is of course negligible compared to the big 
international aid services. However, in Hungary, parcels are 
usually collected to help the Hungarians in Vojvodina, or, as it 
were, to help the Vojvodina. 
  [Mucsi] This is of course different.... 
  [Vekas] We are convinced that people in Hungary generally 
think of the Hungarians in Vojvodina, however, the Hungarians 
receive very little from these packages. We would like to 
clarify this issue. What we can do is that, if we receive 
adequate information on the collections in Hungary, and it is 
clearly shown to whom, for what purpose, and where the aid is 
intended, then we can say whether the consignment has arrived at 
its destination. Naturally, everyone has the right to decide 
whom he wants to help, and for what purpose he gives the aid -- 
in this sense, we do not wish to prevent anyone from aiding, for 
example, the Bosnian Serbs. However, in our view, it is 
dishonest to forward the aid that is collected specifically for 
the Vojvodina Hungarians to some other destination.

<F P=106> [Interview with Polish President Lech Walesa by Peter </F>
Fridner in Warsaw on 23 January: "Instead of Fruitless 
Discussions, Let Us Deal With Concrete Issues"] 
  [Text] Warsaw -- On the occasion of the visit to 
Poland by the president of the Slovak Republic [Michal Kovac], 
Polish President granted an interview to NARODNA OBRODA in his 
residence at the Warsaw Belveder. 
  [Fridner] Your most recent guest comes from a country that 
became independent only recently. How has the emergence and 
existence of this state, the Slovak Republic, been received in 
Poland? 
  [Walesa] I do not really know how it has been received in 
Poland. We know that we have to be neighbors, that our 
relations must be good, and they have the chance to be so. We 
are only in the process of forming them. How they will look 
depends on how successful we are going to be in forming them. I 
am convinced that we are going to be good neighbors, and we will 
do everything in our power so that our respective countries 
benefit from the neighborhood. 
  [Fridner] Are you aware of any political problems between 
our two countries? 
  [Walesa] No, I am not aware of any problems. We can be 
satisfied with our talks and experience to date. That is, 
however, just a matter of political experience and declarations. 
So far, we have not been able to project the good into deeds. 
Of course, we must understand that one cannot ask much from a 
state that has been organizing for only one year. I am 
convinced that as the two countries will be able to put their 
domestic affairs in order, our cooperation will develop and we 
will reap more benefit therefrom. There are no limits. We have 
the desire and great hope, but something must be done about 
their realization. We, politicians, can create the conditions, 
but we cannot substitute for the directors, managers, or bank 
owners, who must convert our fine resolutions to practical 
measures. 
  [Fridner] That will apparently be the issue in question. 
Despite the good political relations between our countries, the 
economic relations have not been developing very favorably. The 
mutual trade indicators have been declining over the past few 
years. Are you aware of something that could change this trend? 
  [Walesa] I would really like to do everything I can to 
reverse these adverse tendencies. If we had a centrally 
controlled command system, we might have compelled something. 
In the system based on economic freedom, however, it is 
difficult to force the bankers or private businessmen to 
cooperate. I am convinced that we will show each other what is 
attractive in our respective countries, and this will be a 
stimulus for the people who intend to realize our hopes. 
  [Fridner] Do you think that these questions will play a 
significant role in your upcoming talks with President Kovac? 
  [Walesa] I know from our previous meetings with President 
Kovac that we think alike. I hope that he will bring along 
people who deal with specific problems, people from enterprises, 
financiers, and managers. We will get them together with such 
people from our side, and instruct them to scrutinize our 
economic possibilities in an expert, technical manner. 
  [Fridner] Both our countries belong to the Central European 
region. The guarantee of the security of this region is among 
its main problems, and that particularly after the reinforcement 
of the nationalist tendencies in Russia. How do you feel about 
the situation after the Brussels NATO Summit and the trip of the 
U.S. President to Europe? My premise is that, in Prague, you 
had a chance to meet with President Clinton and the presidents 
of the countries of the Visegrad Group. 
  [Walesa] We have attained that for which we hoped. 
Unfortunately, the dearth of solidarity and teamwork on our part 
has become obvious. Therefore, certain problems have been 
solved for us by others. I am not denigrating the significance 
of the Partnership for Peace idea. If we deal jointly with some 
problems, we can benefit from this initiative in the future. As 
I say, however, there must be solidarity among us. There must 
be solidarity in dealing with our common problems. The question 
of security is one of them. I can tell you that, with President 
Kovac, we understand each other very well regarding this issue. 
There is a certain difference of opinion between us and the 
Czechs, but if we act together, the Czechs will also support us. 
The U.S. Partnership proposal may be a good idea. 
Nevertheless, its effect on us will depend on our application. 
  [Fridner] After the Prague meeting, several commentaries 
proclaimed that the Visegrad Group was buried there, that it is 
dead. Do you share this view? 
  [Walesa] If that were true, it would be against the logic of 
the present world. After all, if the borders are to be 
overcome, a regional cooperation is simply a fact, and you 
cannot do anything about it. One can form various 
configurations but they must be all based on what the life 
brings. We are here, in this region, and we are closer to one 
another than we are to America or elsewhere. The Hungarians, 
you, and Poland agree on this. Even the Czechs agree, if not on 
all issues. So far, it has not been politically necessary for 
us to speak in a single voice. Such a unity was only necessary 
on issues like the abrogation of the Warsaw Pact or CEMA 
[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]. The Czechs are right 
that we are not facing similar problems right now. Regional 
cooperation is unavoidable. I am in favor of those of us who 
agree with it taking certain organizational steps now. It can 
be a cooperation between the Defense or Foreign Ministries, 
oriented at solving various problems. In some questions we can 
proceed jointly, in others individually. 
  [Fridner] You were one of the main protagonists of the 
struggle against the communist totalitarianism. How do you feel 
about the presence of the left-wing forces in the Polish 
Government, moreover, forces that are to a great degree rooted 
in the communist camp? 
  [Walesa] I have spoken about it a lot, and I have not 
changed my opinion. After 50 years of the one-party system, 
people are divided into the active and the passive. The active 
people are further divided into those prepared and those 
unprepared. The best prepared people come from the power 
circles. The less prepared are the ones who did not have the 
power, for instance the members of the Solidarity movement in 
Poland. Now, as the better prepared rejected all the elements 
that used to instill society with anxiety, as they promise to 
build a free social order, a market economy, their superior 
preparation gives them a better chance of success. Peoples do 
not wish to fight all the time. They fight when they do not 
like something, and then they return to work. Those, who offer 
better solutions, win elections. After some time, five-ten 
years, when we look at the programs again, we will redistribute 
ourselves politically. There will be an opportunity to prepare 
oneself for the government and fulfillment of the program. 
Actually, nothing happened in Poland, it is a certain law of 
nature, and similar occurrences can be expected in all other 
countries. 
  [Fridner] Do you believe that the left wing will continue 
with the reform process initiated by the Solidarity governments? 
  [Walesa] I, as president, and all the other active people, 
even if less prepared for government, will be on guard regarding 
our orientation. We will not allow a change of what we have 
achieved. We will intervene at the slightest deviation. The 
system, which has been established now, is a good one. The 
parliament is not as divided as it used to be. We "won in 
quarrels" various things, but the issues in question were in 
fact legal solutions. The current parliament is almost unanimous 
and has a good chance of collecting everything that the previous 
period indicated and turn it into laws very rapidly. It is a 
very interesting situation from the vantage point of Polish 
history. 
  [Fridner] The Slovak public is quite interested in the fate 
of their countrymen, the Slovaks living in the most southern 
part of Poland. To what degree does the Polish state help to 
implement the rights of this minority, particularly in the 
spheres of education, culture, and religious services? 
  [Walesa] These are specific affairs, and they should be 
dealt with by the governments. Since you asked me, however, I 
would like to say this: If we are going to be in an integral 
Europe, these issues will look different. If we are going to be 
divided, they will surface. Therefore, I would like all these 
countries -- Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic 
-- to get in the same orbit. This would eliminate all talk 
about matters of this type. Everybody would have the freedom of 
movement but, at the same time, however, he would keep in mind 
that we live in the same house. Since this has not happened, 
these problems prevail, and we differ in opinion on them, we can 
be even dissatisfied. That is, because we are not a part of an 
integral European organism, there are differences resulting in 
further differences, and they give rise to problems that lead to 
such a question as you asked me.

<F P=106> [Interview with Polish Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk </F>
by unidentified reporters and an unidentified moderator in 
Warsaw on the "Hundred Questions to..." program -- live; no 
video available] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Moderator] Good afternoon to 
you, ladies and gentlemen, to you in the studio, and to you 
Minister Kolodziejczyk. I have an appeal to make to you, our 
viewers -- we would like to also receive your questions which we 
will then pass on to the minister. Some of them we will try to 
answer during the program, and so our phone lines are already 
open; the number is 625-66-77. We are waiting for your 
questions and, while we are waiting for them, there will be 
questions from us, journalists. 
  Mr. Minister, let us begin with what may seem like a routine 
issue but which caused quite a bit of confusion last Friday [21 
January] when the press, radio, and television circulated 
reports of your planned dismissal. We have here a 
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to verify that. What is going 
on? Are these just rumors? What is this all about? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] This happened because of ZYCIE WARSZAWY. Of 
course, the information has absolutely nothing to do with the 
truth. I am amazed since, up to now, ZYCIE WARSZAWY has been 
regarded as a daily which provides truthful information. 
  [Moderator] So that means you are denying the reports. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Yes, absolutely. 
  [Moderator] So the reports are truly false. 
  [Reporter] But Mr. Minister, what about the reasons which 
were listed in ZYCIE WARSZAWY -- do you think they are not 
credible, I mean for instance the coalition's pressure to assume 
deputy- ministerial posts in your ministry? And what about the 
budget draft, which I take it you are unhappy with and which is 
currently being worked on in the Sejm, and also the probable 
failure of the concept of a National Security Council? Do all 
these reasons not cause you to consider the possibility of 
resigning? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] No, they do not. I assumed the post to 
solve problems and not to try to avoid solving them or to 
desert. That is why everything is still ahead of us. The 
budget has not acquired its final shape yet, whereas issues of 
personnel appointments have not been on the agenda, and, frankly 
speaking, there have not been any serious talks on that topic 
yet.... 
  [Moderator, interrupting] Mr. Minister, I think we will be 
dealing with these issues later on. 
  [Reporter] But Mr. Minister, if we were to look at what I 
will call a conclusion of everything that we are talking about 
here: This is linked with this alleged dismissal of yours. You 
are subordinated both to the prime minister and the president. 
The president is commander of the Armed Forces whereas the 
prime minister is the government's chief and also your direct 
superior. Whose order would you execute if it were to turn out 
that the two officials' orders contradict one another? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] The president is the constitutional superior 
over the Armed Forces and he has appropriate powers for that. 
But what you asked is quite a theoretical proposition because 
up to now.... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] But it may turn out a [word 
indistinct] problem. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Up to now, both these gentlemen charged with 
responsibility over the country's security have been cooperating 
with one another in a way which I think.... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] And what if there was to be a 
disagreement anyway [word indistinct]? 
  [Kolodziejczyk, hesitating] I hope that will not happen. 
After all, the responsibility linked to these people's high 
posts must prevail. There can be no private views of any kind 
involved. The interests of the state are what must prevail, and 
there are no signs so far that it should be otherwise. 
  [Moderator] Mr. Minister, excuse me. So let us finish the 
issue of your alleged dismissal. You denied the rumors. 
  The next issue which I think will be a major theme of our 
conversation today is the situation which has emerged after the 
Prague and Brussels summits, and everything going along with 
that. There were a lot of debates but mainly on the diplomatic 
side, concerning the sense of safety, grand issues on a high 
level, but I would like to ask you a blunt question: What about 
the cost? The cost will probably have to be borne by you. I 
read in one of your statements that you do not even have the 
money to open up a bureau in Brussels. So what is the situation 
practically speaking? What about our participation in joint 
maneuvers? Who will pay for that? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Well, strictly speaking, there is no such 
item listed in the budget. I have postulated to have the budget 
supplemented because naturally, these issues will have to be 
accompanied by expenditures. In any case, the documents of the 
Brussels summit clearly say that the partners shall bear the 
cost of their participation. It is a huge problem since we are 
aware that the NATO countries will come up with some monies and 
they will be available to those who themselves have contributed 
in a major way. So far -- if the budget is approved in its 
proposed form -- there is really no money for participation in 
the Partnership for Peace initiative. 
  [Reporter] On the topic of Partnership for Peace: Leszek 
Moczulski, chairman of the Confederation for an Independent 
Poland, said it was a defeat for Polish diplomats whereas other 
political parties were more restrained in their assessments. 
What is your evaluation of the proposal, from a military 
standpoint? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] I regard Mr. Moczulski's evaluation as a 
good sign for the initiative's future, since his predictions 
have to date proved untrue. 
  [Reporter] My question is very specific. Last Thursday, you 
held a conference with Foreign Minister Olechowski. You were 
both working on a kind of letter of intent containing our 
proposals, I mean a list of goals which we want to achieve 
within Partnership for Peace. Could you tell us what are our 
main goals which we want to achieve through the Partnership? 
And another question, which is linked to that: Do you think 
that this is a kind of camouflaged path into NATO? I mean 
camouflaged in the sense that we have to do something so as not 
to irritate Russia? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] No, no. First of all, I must make a 
correction here. The meeting with Minister Olechowski took 
place face-to-face, so whatever is said as to its topic is just 
allegations, but I can reveal that information. The Partnership 
for Peace initiative has been developing [hesitating] quite 
fast. We must be prepared to undertake the appropriate 
measures, but the immediate topic of my meeting [with 
Olechowski] was my two-day visit to Prague, which begins 
tomorrow, and another visit to Berlin where I will meet German 
Defense Minister Ruehe. During the meeting with Minister 
Olechowski, we had to agree on some details and on some topics 
to be discussed there, and also to agree on some issues which 
may be the subject of debates both in Prague and Berlin. 
  [Reporter] Let us continue with the Washington theme. 
Namely, last Thursday German NTV Television showed pictures 
during a report from Washington of Minister Olechowski talking 
to the press and to some experts, and the television reported 
that while substituting for you [Kolodziejczyk] he informed the 
Americans about what type of airborne equipment we need, and 
also what kind of modernization of armored forces and what kind 
of airborne defense system we need. Can you confirm or deny this 
information? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] I think it is a good sign if the foreign 
minister is a spokesman for the defense minister and if he can 
competently discuss some issues in my place. Minister 
Olechowski and I are cooperating quite closely and I think that 
cooperation will bring about good results. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Minister, what kind of an amount are we 
talking about? I mean, by how much would the ministry's budget 
have to be increased to enable talking about Partnership in 
reasonable terms? There is talk in the Sejm about a sum of 500 
billion zlotys. Is that true? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Yes, it is, but let us be more precise here. 
NATO has about 200 various working groups and if we were to send 
there just 100 officers this year without special equipment, 
that in itself would cost about 60-80 billion zlotys. If we 
want to participate in maneuvers, that will mean additional 
costs, whereas it is the intensity of our participation 
precisely in those maneuvers and also in work by the General 
Headquarters and by other working groups, that determine the 
rate of Poland's getting close to NATO. We want to see that 
process of getting close happen. 
  [Reporter] But where will we get the money, Mr. Minister? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] That is exactly the question. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] of a social kind of 
collection, such as in the case of the chief officer of a group 
of villages, I think from Koscierzyna, who came up with the idea 
of a fund which would support our Armed Forces [words 
indistinct]? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] I regard Mr. Tkaczyk's initiative as a very 
noble one, and in any event, it has been accompanied by quite a 
good response, since both people associated with the old 
National Army [Armia Krajowa] as well as the Podhalanie group 
and other professional groups -- we also saw some street poll 
results at the program's beginning. Right now, work is going on 
regarding how to organize a foundation from a legal standpoint 
-- a foundation which could financially support the Army, 
especially regarding the Army's technical modernization. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] Mr. Minister, how many Polish 
military officers speak English? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] About 1,000 -- this is how many of them are 
active in various peace missions, so they have some experience 
in that regard. We keep training them intensively, and not just 
in Poland. It is of course a problem, but it is not 
insurmountable. Still, money remains the fundamental problem 
since it is also needed for language training. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] Mr. Minister, what are in 
actual fact your priorities as defense minister in relation to 
the West? Should not these priorities be, for instance, 
primarily about gaining access to sophisticated technology, and 
if so -- in what areas? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Exactly, that is precisely so. That is the 
most serious problem since if we want to approach NATO 
standards, then we must have knowledge concerning those 
standards -- that is guaranteed by the Partnership for Peace 
initiative, that is the first thing. Secondly, we must 
establish technological cooperation. Our intellectual potential 
is significant and we are very close to finalizing many, very 
interesting research and scientific projects. But there is no 
money for that, including within the Scientific Research 
Committee since the Army does not have a lot of money, either. 
Technological cooperation could solve a great deal of our 
problems based on our research institutes and our industry. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] technological cooperation 
between Poland and NATO, and that we should be approaching NATO 
technically speaking. Meanwhile, Hungary intends to purchase -- 
or perhaps they already purchased -- a Russian early-warning 
system which is reported to be the most modern available. Is 
what you said really the only direction for Poland? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] [words indistinct] not quite correct 
information. Hungary has purchased -- or rather obtained in 
lieu of their debt -- 24 MiG-29 aircraft which are regarded by 
the NATO countries as contemporary technology, and Hungary also 
intends to purchase an S-300 antiaircraft defense system. 
Indeed, when one compares the technical parameters, that system 
is more efficient and more productive than the Patriot system. 
We ourselves are considering -- unless there are other offers 
-- purchasing the S-300 system. 
  [Reporter] From Russia? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] [words indistinct] but that is a kind of 
topic where I would like to add a few more things: Cooperation 
with NATO does not mean identical techniques and technologies 
immediately. The most important aspects are command systems, 
fire-direction systems, communications systems which would most 
probably have to be changed as priority, and reconnaissance 
systems. These will be able to be made uniform quite soon. On 
the other hand, introducing modern technology within the armored 
or airborne troops -- that has to be extended into a process. 
Anyway, just take a look if you please, at the state of 
technology in the Portuguese Armed Forces, for instance -- the 
country is a full NATO member -- and a comparison with Portugal 
is not so bad for us at all.... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] [words indistinct] excuse me. 
German 
Defense Minister Ruehe will probably suggest to you in a few 
days that joint maneuvers should be conducted, and these will 
take place very soon, that is in September 1994. Can we afford 
to take part in such maneuvers? Is it your prediction that 
apart from the joint trilateral naval maneuvers -- I mean among 
Denmark, Germany, and Poland -- there will also be land 
maneuvers? Can we afford that financially? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Let us talk about that once I am back from 
Berlin -- right now it would be tantamount to counting our 
chickens before they are hatched. 
  [Reporter] Partnership for Peace is also about securing a 
gradual, civilian, and democratic control over the Army. 
Meantime, some reforms being conducted in the Defense Ministry 
-- for instance the transfer of the Personnel Department to the 
General Staff -- is kind of a contradiction of that democratic 
principle. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] What you are saying was fabricated by the 
press and has absolutely nothing to do with the truth. As for 
today, the relationship between civilian-military structures and 
those purely military ones, is a 50-50 relationship, or close to 
it. Nobody has any intention of giving up any department for the 
sake of the General Staff, and as regards the educational 
functions and the practical work along with the soldier -- that 
must be conducted in the command system, that is to say close to 
the General Staff. I want to emphasize very strongly that we 
are aware that one of the most fundamental and cardinal 
preconditions for our approaching European security structures 
is a democratic supervision over the Army, that is over the 
Armed Forces, and we will not give it up. 
  [Reporter] But Mr. Minister, we are talking here about the 
Army, which also includes the Military Information Services, so 
do you think that these services should be subject to 
parliamentary supervision? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Of course they should. Regarding the type 
of supervision or its extent -- that is something to be debated. 
But the supervision as such must exist and I personally think 
-- this is my personal view -- that the Sejm should appoint a 
group consisting of people enjoying public confidence, for a 
longer term -- something akin to the Constitutional Tribunal or 
the State Tribunal -- and these people would then exercise a 
very detailed supervision over the military special services. 
For the time being, a completely different kind of measure is 
being prepared it seems, the inception of which, by the way, 
dates back to the 10th Term Sejm but was never implemented in 
practice. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Minister, I would like to return for a 
moment to the Defense Ministry's budget. You are complaining 
about lack of funds whereas in the meantime, about 4 percent of 
the budget goes to the Defense Ministry's central agencies. The 
central agencies represent military bureaucracy. The funds 
spent on that purpose have not decreased during recent years -- 
that means that military bureaucracy is also getting stronger. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Listen, it is 4 percent but it is not spent 
on the bureaucracy -- that is what the whole misunderstanding is 
about. The 4 percent is also spent on investments, including 
computerization, introducing information systems -- everything 
that is linked with technical progress and that is why we should 
not ignore the fact that included in the 4 percent are all the 
other sections without which we will never approach the level of 
any contemporary army in today's world. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Minister, you said you are very aware of the 
importance of civilianization of the military services -- that 
is the Army -- as one of the important preconditions for joining 
NATO. But your first step after assuming the post of minister 
was to suspend the internal regulations issued by the former 
minister, who had acted in the direction of a firm 
civilianization of the Defense Ministry. How would you explain 
that? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Very simply. First of all, the internal 
regulations had indeed been approved but they were never 
implemented in practice. There were some controversial 
provisions included there which failed to delineate clear lines 
of division of powers -- that is the primary thing. But there 
is also the aspect that the law on the Armed Forces' functioning 
is tangled up and in disarray, and we began the process of 
remedying that from the top down: The prerogatives of the 
Republic of Poland's Security Council, the Council of Ministers' 
Defense Affairs Committee, amendments made to the Law on the 
Popular Defense Obligation which will make a very precise kind 
of distinction [hesitating] between [word indistinct] and 
obligations or powers of a civilian defense minister and the 
chief of the General Staff, followed by corrections made to the 
internal rules you mentioned. To do it in reverse order would 
lead to an even greater discrepancy than the one we have right 
now. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Minister, there are approximately as many 
people working in our arms industry as there are in the Armed 
Forces. What is your evaluation of the role of the Polish arms 
industry in the efforts to increase the country's security? Is 
there not any neglect here in terms of doctrine, in terms of 
what we really want, or is it just an issue of money? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] No, there is no neglect of this kind, but we 
are struggling with what is the legacy of the past period. Our 
[arms] industry until recently -- that is as recently as four 
years ago -- produced 50 percent of its production for the 
purposes of the Armed Forces and the other 50 percent was 
exported out of the country. Currently the exports have died 
out completely, the Armed Forces' demand decreased to what are 
outright symbolic figures, and so the huge industry and its 
potential is not being used. Military orders alone are not 
enough to keep the industry afloat, it needs to be restructured 
soon, it needs a definition of those areas which have good 
future prospects, as well as those that are not profitable in 
which case.... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] So could you define them? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Listen, we have already been through that. 
I could well define them once I learn in what areas of 
technology we will be able to cooperate with the West. That is 
the fundamental issue without which we will fail to decide what 
to sustain. But it is an obvious truth that a sovereign state 
must base its Army's supplies on domestic industry to a large 
extent. 
  [Reporter] But on the other hand, the Defense Ministry 
refuses to purchase quite modern IRYD aircraft and at the same 
time the ministry maintains completely obsolete and costly 
MiG-21 aircraft. One hour of operation by such an aircraft costs 
about 50 million zlotys. Can you not see that these aircraft 
devour the money that could be spent on IRYD aircraft that could 
be manufactured? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Listen, one just cannot confuse the 
functions of an education-training aircraft with those of a 
combat aircraft. Unfortunately, the MiG-21's are being 
withdrawn, they will not be subjected to overhauls or 
supplemented with [word indistinct] electronic equipment, which 
is the case for instance with MiG-29's. Still, we need them for 
the time being since we are below the level of [word 
indistinct]. The IRYD on the other hand -- under the 
assumptions guiding it -- was to be an education-combat 
aircraft, but the industry failed to implement that 
assumption.... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] But it can still be such an 
aircraft [words indistinct]. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] If it becomes such an aircraft, then we will 
start purchasing it. But it is not the case for the time being 
and the industry is doing very little -- or practically nothing 
-- to fulfill those preconditions which had been set at the 
initial phase of the process of designing the aircraft. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] will you devote to Polish 
industry this year? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Out of the Defense Ministry's budget? It 
will be about 15 percent. As far as I... I am sorry. Let me 
put it another way: 75 percent of what there is, goes for arms 
purchases and the remaining 15 percent will be for indispensable 
purchases of spare parts as well as for overhauls of post-Soviet 
equipment since our industry does not have the capability to 
produce the parts. 
  [Reporter] On the issue of post-Soviet: Mr. Minister, do 
you not think that the Soviet Union could use Partnership for 
Peace to make a faster and more effective approach to the West 
than Poland, which would then create a kind of political gap? 
That is my first question, and I have another one related to 
the first question: Namely, the current governing coalition 
regards improvement of relations with the East as one of its 
priorities, parallel to the strategic goal of getting closer to 
NATO. What is your perspective on this? Do you see any chance 
at all for such cooperation with the East regarding security 
policy in a situation where the East is not making it easy for 
you, for instance -- ignoring for a moment the issue of military 
doctrine -- by refusing to decrease the levels of heavy 
armaments? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] You know, these are extremely complicated 
issues. You asked whether Russia will not get ahead of us in 
its efforts to be a NATO member. The political situation is a 
precondition to even begin talking about Partnership for Peace 
-- by political situation I mean a democratic regime, clarity of 
military budgets, democratic supervision over the Army, and so 
on and so forth. I hope that kind of process has been initiated 
in Moscow, although recent news from there does not indicate 
that the process could be fast. Well, from a technological 
standpoint I am sure Russia would be a more interesting partner 
than us -- I mean aircraft, rockets, not to mention cluster 
weapons, to name just a few. Now, regarding creation of 
security for our country, I think there are four parallel paths 
involved here: The first one is precisely about good 
cooperation and relationships with all our neighbors and, at 
least as far as we in the Defense Ministry are concerned, we are 
trying to build such good relationships. A second issue -- or a 
second path if you like -- is regional cooperation to which we 
will be condemned for many years to come, for instance by using 
the same kind of technology -- I will not discuss this in 
detail, we will talk about this in Prague, as well. A third 
direction is about getting closer to the European security 
structures, while a fourth one is about activation of 
disarmament, I mean the Vienna disarmament process. The fewer 
weapons there are -- and there are still whole arsenals of 
nuclear weapons in Europe to the east of our borders -- the less 
security, naturally. [sentence as heard] 
  [Reporter] Do you believe that Ukraine will get rid of its 
nuclear weapons like it declared during the 
Clinton-Yeltsin-Kravchuk meeting? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] I hope it will. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Minister, you said a moment ago that we must 
establish technological cooperation with NATO countries. Does 
Poland have access to the latest technologies right now? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Unfortunately, we do not; but we are looking 
for alternative solutions. We have cooperation with the Swedes 
which looks promising, with a company as famous as Thompson, 
which is already in cooperation with us with regard to 
production of reconnaissance, identification, and navigation 
systems which will make it possible to release some additional 
frequency channels for television. 
  [Moderator] [Words indistinct] I have a few questions here 
precisely on that issue: What is you perspective on the issue 
of granting frequencies to television stations? [Former 
Defense] Minister Onyszkiewicz kept saying it was apparently 
possible. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Whatever was possible, was done -- I am 
saying that with full responsibility for my words. In any case, 
this is an issue for the Communications Ministry, with which we 
have signed appropriate agreements.... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] [Words indistinct] done in that 
case because you said whatever possible.... 
  [Kolodziejczyk, interrupting] Those channels which the Army 
is now using -- we cannot release them because of the security 
of flights and because of state security. 
  [Reporter] So that means that the National Radio and 
Television Council holds sessions and interviews candidates [to 
receive frequency channels] almost for their own sake, but the 
Army does not intend to release any additional frequencies 
anyway? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] First of all, one must sit down at a table 
and begin talking. So far this has not happened. We have been 
debating through the mass media and [passage indistinct] and the 
three channels is the absolutely minimum amount indispensable to 
the Army and as we keep introducing new technologies -- 
especially radiolocating and electronic ones -- we will be 
surrendering these channels, but there is resistance.... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] On the issue of talking to one 
another through the Sejm. The Sejm National Defense Commission 
has criticized in the past the concentration of different 
functions performed by Minister Milewski. Do you think that 
there cannot be more than two deputy ministers in the ministry? 
I think that would resolve a great many political problems.... 
  [Kolodziejczyk, interrupting] I am sure we could use another 
deputy minister just to act as sentry on the government's 
benches during Sejm sessions, since it requires enormous amounts 
of time. 
  [Reporter] I have a very specific question: How do you 
intend to go about solving the following issue.... 
  [Kolodziejczyk, interrupting] But I did not answer 
completely a moment ago. The controversial case of Minister 
Milewski is completely different than what the press presents to 
their readers or viewers. The press is telling only part of the 
truth. The other part is that his appointment is linked to the 
intention to reform the entire management scheme of the state's 
security apparatus, where the National Security Bureau -- or 
practically the National Council's Secretariat -- will be 
performing technical functions. The point is to avoid repeating 
some functions within the Army's and the National Security 
Bureau's structures, and that is why the post will be absolutely 
of a technical nature; it is acceptable and there are no legal 
impediments to that. On the contrary, I will say it could 
facilitate transferring tasks from the National Council's 
decisionmaking area to the executive area, that is the Defense 
Ministry or the Council of Ministers and the Council of 
Ministers' Defense Affairs Committee I mentioned before, which I 
hope will be established soon. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] directs two ministries? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] That is a matter of convention. Social and 
defense policies are reconcilable, and there is also the issue 
of the number of director-generals and so forth who are a step 
below, and we have to keep in mind we are trying to fight 
bureaucracy. [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] Mr. Minister, the rate of increase of religious 
chaplains in the Army has been the same as the increase in the 
popularity of the weekly NIE among the cadre. So my question 
is: What are the guiding principles behind the education process 
in the Army currently, and also: Are not the educators' minds 
in a whirl? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Listen, the Army is indeed the last 
institution which has been trying to continue -- I repeat: 
continue -- the education process. It is not possible during a 
year and a half to make up for neglect which began back in 
kindergarten, high school, or even in the family. We must be 
very clear on that. But as regards reading NIE, I think that 
the popularity rate is not very different from what happens 
generally in society. Above all, if we talk about democracy -- 
including in the Army, which has to be somewhat limited there -- 
then let us not try to force soldiers to read this and not read 
that. It is an issue of their will and that will must be 
respected. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Zbigniew Lentowicz: "An Armed Caravan Is Going"] </F>
  [Text] "There have always been and there still are 
temptations to dominate the Army," declared Defense Minister 
Piotr Kolodziejczyk at a 26 January news conference in the 
Warsaw Conference Center of the National Defense Ministry. 
  The minister stressed that he always opposed such 
tendencies, 
because especially in the period of the transformation of the 
Army "they cause harmful chaos in the Armed Forces." He added 
that if the political manipulations exceed a certain limit and 
if in the near future, there is a culmination of unfavorable 
phenomena, such as the budget debate which was unfavorable to 
the Army, he may come to the conclusion that there is no place 
for him in Warsaw. For the time being, however, "as long as his 
hands are not tied," the possibility of resignation is out of 
the question. Because he is not used to deserting because of 
difficulties, "the caravan will continue," said Kolodziejczyk; 
he carefully evaded answering the question of who exactly is 
trying to politically dominate the Army and what the 
manipulations are. He merely said that in recent days, he had 
met with Deputy Prime Minister Cimoszewicz in order to discuss 
the issue of the final decisions concerning the model for 
steering the Ministry of National Defense [MON]. These problems 
will probably be resolved at the end of this month or the 
beginning of next month, the MON head expects; he hopes that it 
will be not a "contemporary model, but a model for years." 
  MON roughly estimates that the costs of the "Partnership for 
Peace" program will amount to nearly 0.5 trillion zlotys [Z]. 
Approximately Z60 to Z80 billion are needed to establish our 
military mission with the NATO leadership in Brussels. We would 
have to spend Z420 billion for participating in this year's 
training. 
  Kolodziejczyk is determined to maintain the civilian control 
over the Army; the control should be such as it is envisioned in 
the standards accepted by Western Europe and NATO. "It is with 
disgust that I read reports on the alleged conflict on the 
border of the civilian and military segments within MON," the 
minister was backed up by General Tadeusz Wilecki, chief of the 
general staff. He mentioned that there are sometimes 
differences of opinion; however, in a situation in which 
difficult problems must be resolved, this is entirely 
understandable. Jerzy Milewski, first deputy of the minister 
and head of the National Security Office, evaluates press 
enunciations bluntly as "false and outrageous." "Well, I have 
found myself in the ministry at the motion of Minister 
Kolodziejczyk," explained Milewski; in addition, his superior 
gave assurances that they had known each other for ages and the 
cooperation between them was developing very well. 
  After one year's experiences in the area of steering the 
Armed Forces in line with new rules, General Wilecki announced 
on Wednesday [26 January] that there would be serious changes, 
not only in the central establishments of the Army. 
  The General Staff, as the chief command body, will include 
newly established inspectorates (or centers of command) of the 
naval and air forces; the General Staff chief believes that this 
will place these forces higher to the strategic level, which 
will strengthen their position in the Army. Transforming the 
model of the functioning of the quite extensive Air Forces and 
Air Protection Forces will entail serious reductions of forces 
and equipment; at least 20 airfields will become redundant. 
"However, local communities increasingly often protest 
liquidating the garrisons that the strategists decided should be 
liquidated. Self-governmental authorities are willing to stop 
collecting fees -- only if the Army stayed in the town," says 
General Wilecki. 
  The establishment of the experimental "ground-air" Krakow 
district will be continued; so far the process is half-way 
completed (it is scheduled for completion in 1997). Within its 
framework, the following formations will be established: 14th 
brigade in Przemysl, 21st brigade in Rzeszow, 23d brigade in 
Gliwice. In addition, the Krakow and Lublin garrisons will be 
extended. The experiences gained in the Krakow district will be 
useful in the future, in building a mobile brigade system, 
adjusted to the structures accepted in NATO. 
  In the area of the Lodz Voivodship a division of armored 
cavalry will be established. Three regiments: in Leczyca, 
Tomaszow Mazowiecki, and Nowe Miasto will be equipped with 
Polish "Huzar" helicopters, light anti-infantry, and antitank 
weapons. This way some kind of fast reaction forces will be 
established; General Wilecki calls them formations of "winged 
infantry." 
  A committee that is working on the new model of military 
education is completing its work. As early as this autumn, the 
first officers cadets will be trained in line with new rules. 
The number of schools will be decreased by half; some persons 
of the didactic cadres will be transferred to "future-oriented" 
schools. 
  Minister Kolodziejczyk estimates the redundant military 
property that has been left over by the once-twice-as-big Polish 
Army at Z2 trillion. After a period of great interest at the 
beginning, no one wants to buy the empty barracks and 
store-rooms (the Army, in order to protect them from 
devastation, is spending its money). The minister hopes that 
this government will see to this problem. So far there has not 
been an appropriate agency that would free the Army of this 
burden.

  [Text] Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak visited the 
Polish Press Agency [PAP] this morning. During a brief meeting 
of the agency management he spoke about the need for 
journalistic integrity. 
  [Begin Pawlak recording] I hope that PAP will deal with 
facts 
and information related to facts and not with spreading feelers 
put out by other media. This, I think, is a general issue that 
concerns mass media in general, to concentrate on facts -- and 
on important facts -- and not make a huge story out of minor 
matters. It often happens that once a story is verified it is 
hard to tell where it originated, but by that time it is all 
over the place. 
  So, I think that such an agency as PAP should serve as an 
example of reliability and publish information that is important 
to the public, the state, and the economy. [end recording] 
  Asked what feelers he had in mind, Prime Minister Pawlak 
recalled the issue of the Concordat. 
  [Begin Pawlak recording] There was a situation when a well 
known local radio set in motion an avalanche of suppositions, 
speculations, and considerations around alleged expert reports. 
Later, when there was a joint statement by the government and 
episcopate press offices, it seemed like the reports could 
hardly get through. 
  I understand that sensations should find their way to the 
consumers, but journalistic integrity requires equal treatment 
of information concerning facts and correction of information if 
it is untrue. But it would be best not to deal with untrue 
information at all. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by B.I.W.: "CBOS: A Cabinet for More Than a Year"] </F>
  [Text] Since December, support for the government has been 
on the wane; nevertheless, the government still has more 
supporters (45 percent) than opponents (18 percent). Almost 50 
percent of respondents to a public opinion poll believe that the 
present government will stay in power for more than a year. 
  Over the last two years, the number of people who support 
the 
idea of increasing the president's influence on the work of the 
government has decreased. Forty percent of respondents believe 
that the policy of the government offers a chance for overcoming 
the crisis, even though since November the number of optimists 
has decreased quite noticeably (by almost 15 percent). For the 
first time since the Pawlak government was formed, 37 percent of 
Poles are of the opinion that this government is neither better 
nor worse than the previous one; 34 percent believe it is better. 
  This research study was conducted by the Public Opinion 
Research Center [CBOS] between 14 and 17 January with a 
representative sample of adult Poles.

<F P=106> [Report by R.W.: "Against a Purge of Voivodes"] </F>
  [Text] "Voivodes that belong to parties other than the 
governing ones are recalled unfairly," say more than half of the 
respondents to an opinion poll conducted by the Sopot Public 
Opinion Research Institute [PBS] at the request of 
RZECZPOSPOLITA. "The issue of who should fill the post of a 
voivode should not be determined by party membership," believe 
almost three-fourths of respondents. The replacement of 
voivodship heads of the state administration, announced by the 
peasant-social democratic government, is rather moderately 
supported by the public. 
  So far the Pawlak government has recalled ten voivodes (the 
eleventh voivode is supposed to be recalled toward the end of 
January, when he returns from sick leave); eight new voivodes 
have been appointed. The vacant posts are in Lublin and 
Rzeszow. Representatives of the governing coalition said more 
than once that only the future of ten, or maybe a little over a 
dozen voivodes, could be classified as safe. The main criterion 
for the central authorities was supposed to be the fact whether 
a given voivode had good or bad relations with the local 
structures of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and the Democratic 
Left Alliance [SLD]. Any protests by activists of these parties 
is the first step to dismiss the head of the local governmental 
administration. There appear statements that the issue of 
filling this post should be decided by the party that won the 
parliamentary elections in the particular voivodship. It is 
worth recalling that SLD won in 25 voivodships, PSL in 21, 
Democratic Union [UD] in 2, and the German minority in one. In 
a radio statement, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak said jokingly 
that for him the unparalleled model is Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who 
had replaced all the voivodes. His opponents point out that the 
situation is incomparable, because in 1989 and 1990 a most 
fundamental change in the political system was under way. On 
New Year's Eve, the present government recalled five voivodes; 
this is half as many as the Suchocka government did during its 
entire time in office. 
  It is still unclear of what nature the post of a voivode 
should be: whether it should be an apolitical representative of 
the "civil service" [preceding two words in English], or a 
representative of the governing coalition who is at its full 
political disposal. The law on the state civil service, which 
many people hope will finally settle this issue, has still not 
even reached a session of the Council of Ministers. 
  Most of the representatives of all the groups questioned by 
PBS are convinced that the issue of filling a voivode post 
should not be determined by party membership (74 percent of the 
answers, whereas 18 percent of the respondents are of the 
opposite opinion). Acceptance of the idea of making the voivode 
post party-related is most often expressed by supporters of SLD 
and the Union for Real Politics. 
  The recalls that have been made so far -- recalls of 
voivodes 
who belong to parties other than the governing ones -- are 
approved by 26 percent of respondents; they are disapproved of 
by 55 percent, and 18 percent refrain from expressing an opinion 
either way. Support for such changes are most often declared by 
supporters of SLD, PSL, as well as the Union of Labor and the 
Confederation for an Independent Poland; however, even in these 
groups they are in the minority. The greatest doubts are 
expressed by supporters of the parties that not long ago were 
still in power: UD, Liberal-Democratic Congress, as well as the 
groupings comprising the former "Fatherland" coalition. 
  The opinion poll was conducted on 15 and 16 January with a 
representative sample of 1,064 adult Poles. 
<H5>  [Box, p 1] </H5>
  Should the issue of the filling the post of a voivode be 
determined by party membership? 
  42 percent -- definitely not 
  32 percent -- probably not 
  13 percent -- probably yes 
  5 percent -- definitely yes 
  8 percent -- hard to say

<F P=106> [Interview with Slobodan Jarcevic, foreign minister of the </F>
republic of Serb Krajina, by unidentified correspondent in 
Belgrade -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Reporter] Good day, or better to say, good 
evening! 
  [Jarcevic] Good evening! [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] To return to the Serbian-Croatian normalization 
agreement, a document that only expresses a will and desire to 
normalize the relations, and constitutes no treaty or anything 
similar. You have already spoken a bit about this document, 
finding in it your place as an independent country that will, in 
a certain historic moment, decide where and with whom it wants 
to live, observing the political will of the people to the 
greatest possible extent. Therefore, how do you perceive what 
is being called the interpretation of this document, the 
interpretation venturing into the sphere of mutual recognition 
and the establishment of economic and transportation links. 
  [Jarcevic] The interpretation of this agreement coming from 
Zagreb should worry us. However, we are used to this as the 
Croats never speak about the events and their relations with the 
republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK] and other countries 
realistically. They always express their wishes and many people 
have noticed that this is only a dream of the Croatian 
politicians. 
  [Reporter] However, I was listening to television last 
night, I cannot recall exactly which channel it was, to a man 
who, as I understood it, is envisaged to be the chief of the 
Croatian bureau in Belgrade, who was stating precisely that the 
Serbs and the Croats have had enough of mourning clothes and 
ruins and spoke very calmly, I would say, without any 
aggravation or stubbornness, or any dwelling on those well-known 
stories about bits of territories of this or another country. 
  [Jarcevic] Mr. Markovic is right when he says that both 
sides have had enough of war, bloodshed, destruction, and the 
decreasing standard of living on both sides. He is right, and I 
have nothing to add here. However, Mr. Markovic, if he 
represents the government in Zagreb, could have eliminated all 
this a few months earlier, in February 1993, when a RSK 
delegation offered Croatia the establishment of transport, 
railroad, and postal links, the use of oil pipelines, and 
everything else that is in the interests of the Republic of 
Croatia. Without this it cannot consolidate itself and get its 
economy and its society back on their feet. What is preventing 
the Croats from accomplishing all these goals is an agreement 
that they must sign with the RSK representatives. [passage 
omitted] 
  The Croats have rejected signing any sort of agreement in 
this sense with the RSK government as everybody would know that 
this would mean a signature between two countries. Croatia was 
in a dilemma whether to recognize us or not. It has decided not 
to recognize us and not to sign any agreements, hoping to now 
sign such agreements with the FRY [Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia]. However, this is illusionary. Croatia will sign 
with the FRY only the agreements that regard the territory, the 
economy, and all the rest, of the FRY. Everything that should 
be regulated on the RSK territory, Croatia must anyway sign with 
the RSK government. [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] Mr. Jarcevic, you are a member of the present RSK 
government. The presidential elections have just ended. It is 
well known that this post went to Milan Martic. Regarding the 
events relating to the constitution of the assembly, can you 
briefly tell us when the constituting session of the assembly, 
the election of the government, and everything else are 
envisaged? 
  [Jarcevic] I believe that the assembly will convene next 
week already and that the new president, Mr. Milan Martic, will 
entrust the mandate to one of the politicians who originates 
from the RSK. It is certain that the reconstruction of the 
government will take place. It is impossible for it to remain 
in its present makeup, because the president has announced that 
he would employ more people in the state administration for it 
to be more efficient. Namely, what has hindered the RSK's 
development was precisely the lack of efficient administration. 
You know that the Republic of Croatia has inherited almost the 
entire state administration and other institutions on the RSK 
territory, for example, there was not a single archive center. 
This means that, for decades, the Croatian leaders in the 
former SFRY [Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] have been 
deliberately taking away from the Serbian ethnic territories 
anything that resembled an attribute of a state. 
  [Reporter] Therefore, it will be a major task to put all 
this in order? 
  [Jarcevic] There will be a lot of work and I think that 
President Martic intends to invite numerous cadres who have 
sought refuge in the FRY into the administration, economy, 
police, and the army. 
  [Reporter] Thank you very much.

  [Text] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman received Ukrainian 
Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko this evening. Minister Zlenko 
conveyed to President Tudjman greetings from Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk as well as Kravchuk's message that Ukraine 
attaches special importance to good neighborly relations between 
Ukraine and Croatia. 
  President Tudjman stressed Ukraine's considerable 
contribution to efforts aimed at a peaceful settlement of the 
crisis in the UN Protected Areas, particularly with help from 
the Ukrainian battalion serving with the UNPROFOR. 
  Successful cooperation with the UN and the CSCE, as well as 
Ukraine's support -- on the diplomatic field -- for efforts 
aimed at a peaceful settlement of the situation in former 
Yugoslavia, were said to be of particular importance for both 
countries. Both sides reached the conclusion that all the 
prerequisites exist for a successful development of political, 
economic, cultural, sporting, and other relations.

  [Text] Talks ended in Zagreb this evening between the 
Croatian and Ukrainian foreign ministers, Mate Granic and 
Anatoliy Zlenko. After the talks the two ministers held a news 
conference. In a brief statement the Ukrainian minister said, 
among other things: 
  [Begin Zlenko recording, in Ukrainian with superimposed 
Serbo-Croatian translation] The main result of our visit to 
Croatia is the fact that after discussing issues of mutual 
interest, we achieved near identity of views on numerous 
problems. We also agreed on the main guidelines concerning the 
development of our relations and on a need to resolve some 
concrete issues. Apart from this we agreed on a legal framework 
for ways of resolving these issues, and decided what we could 
start working on in the near future. Interstate expert groups 
will meet to try and resolve certain issues. 
  However, and this is most important, we are all convinced 
that the Croatian people view the Ukrainian people with sympathy 
and this forms a basis for the future comprehensive development 
of cooperation between the two countries. 
  Our future concrete tasks include the preparation and 
signing, very shortly, of an agreement on friendly cooperation, 
expected to take place at the time of Premier Granic's visit to 
Kiev. We also agreed -- because of a failure to implement the 
agreement on trade cooperation signed three years ago -- to 
prepare another such document with more realistic objectives. 
We hope that this is already a substantial progress in our 
relations. [end recording] 
  In his statement Croatian Minister Mate Granic stressed the 
following: 
  [Begin Granic recording] It is perhaps worth saying that 
Croatia and Ukraine have no open questions and that political 
relations and goodwill are at present way above economic 
cooperation. It is clear that both countries are preoccupied 
with their own problems. For Croatia, the most important 
question at present is the reintegration of the occupied 
territories in the legal system of Croatia. Ukraine is more 
preoccupied with economic issues. I believe, however, that we 
will achieve a more substantial development of economic 
relations, for which we have realistic chances. [end recording]

  [Text] Croatian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister 
Mate Granic and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko 
signed a protocol in Zagreb today on cooperation between the 
Croatian and Ukrainian ministries of foreign affairs and a 
protocol on establishing consular relations. 
  We are new independent states and therefore we have mutual 
interests in many spheres. We would primarily wish to develop 
political cooperation, but also economic cooperation, as we have 
good conditions for this, Ukrainian Minister Anatoliy Zlenko 
stated following the signing of the documents. 
  We had talks on the political situation in the region, the 
situation in Croatia and Ukraine, the promotion of economic 
relations which lag behind the political will, and on political 
relations, because there are no open questions between Ukraine 
and Croatia, Mate Granic stated. He announced that treaties on 
friendship and cooperation between the two states, treaties on 
economic, cultural, medical, and transport cooperation, and 
several other important documents are being prepared. 
  The Croatian minister informed journalists that his talks 
with the Ukrainian minister also referred to all important 
issues in Croatian and Ukrainian foreign policy. Minister 
Granic also informed the Ukrainian minister about the Geneva 
negotiations, his visit to Italy in February, and Croatia's 
desire to be admitted to the Council of Europe and to join the 
Partnership for Peace program.

  [Text] Mr. Granic sent a letter to the German Vice 
Chancellor and Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, following 
Germany's decision to repatriate Croat refugees in Germany 
starting from the 30 April of this year. 
  The Croatian foreign minister thanked Germany for its 
efforts 
in caring for thousands of Croat refugees but pointed out that 
one-third of Croatia's territory was still under occupation so 
that most of the refugees cannot return to their homes. 
  In his letter Mr. Granic called on Germany to help in the 
return of refugees to their homes but urged it to keep in mind 
that this process should be carried out in phases in accordance 
with the normalization of relations and the reintegration of the 
UN-protected areas into Croatia's legal system.

  [Text] All the necessary paperwork has been completed by 
the customs office of the port of Split for the initiation of 
criminal proceedings against David Gerard, the commander of the 
British warship Sir Geraint caught violating customs regulations 
yesterday. Rodoljub Jovic reporting for Croatian Radio from 
Split. 
  The illegal container carrying undeclared ammunition, 
explosives, and other military equipment instead of 6,950 
kilograms of petrol and gas has been stored at the Split customs 
warehouse. The head of the customs office of the port of Split, 
Rade Roso, has completed all the administrative formalities and 
has forwarded all the relevant documents to the commander of the 
British warship through the mediation of an official agent. He 
has also filled out a customs violation report and has submitted 
it to the judiciary. 
  According to initial estimates, the value of the undeclared 
cargo is 1 billion 230 million Croatian dinars and the penalty 
for such activities is a fine and the compulsory confiscation of 
the cargo. 
  In reference to yesterday's statement by the spokeswoman for 
the British peacekeepers, Rade Roso repeated today that the 
ship's commander had behaved strangely during the routine 
inspection of the container in question. Namely, the 
above-mentioned container was opened forcibly because the key 
had allegedly been lost and the excuse for this did not strike 
us as plausible because it was given after the violation had 
been discovered and after the real cargo list had been found 
locked up in the container.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] The first day of the 26th session of 
the Slovak parliament contained a very interesting debate. 
Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar spoke in the Slovak 
parliament today [26 January] immediately after the deputies had 
invited him to explain why Economic and Foreign Affairs 
Ministers Jan Ducky and Jozef Moravcik did not accompany 
President Kovac to Poland and why no agreements were signed 
between Poland and Slovakia. 
  [Begin Meciar recording] Let me first thank deputy Miklosko 
for starting a debate on these issues. They are really serious 
and deserve the attention of the Slovak parliament. 
  I learned about preparations for a visit by the Slovak 
president to the Polish Republic on 19 January 1994, from his 
personal letter. Before that, I had neither information about 
the trip nor had I put forward any requests with regard to it. 
Presidential visits are, unfortunately, independent to such an 
extent that they are not coordinated with the government. The 
visit to Poland is not the only one with problems. Other trips 
were the same--for example, the latest visit to Prague. 
  Allow me read out the president's letter: 
  Esteemed Mr. Prime Minister: 
  As you have already been informed, through the mediation of 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and also on the basis of our 
talks with the highest-ranking Polish representatives, on 25-27 
January 1994 I will be on an official visit to Poland, at the 
invitation of President Walesa. Your official meeting with 
Prime Minister Pawlak is also being prepared. Both these events 
and a number of other Slovak-Polish activities that are being 
planned are very important with regard to the importance of 
relations between Slovakia and Poland as partners. On this 
occasion, I would like to ask for your cooperation in organizing 
my visit. 
  I would welcome in particular Minister of Economy Ducky, who 
accompanied me at the talks with President Walesa in Prague, 
being a member of my official delegation in Poland. In addition 
to the official program, the Polish side will prepare separate 
talks for him with his partners--four ministries in the Polish 
Government. The Polish hosts are preparing a similar program for 
Environment Minister Zlocha, and I am asking you also to 
organize his participation. 
  After the experts' talks that preceded this visit, Poland 
expects that at least two agreements will be signed, from a 
whole number of agreements in preparation. It is obvious that 
other agreements will be signed only during your meeting with 
Prime Minister Pawlak. 
  I have been informed that the government, due to its heavy 
schedule, was unable to discuss the agreement between the Slovak 
Government and the Polish Government on environmental 
cooperation. I would welcome it if the government endorsed this 
agreement at a brief meeting, specially convened for this 
purpose, to enable Minister Zlocha to sign it in Warsaw. 
  I have also been informed that the government had some 
comments on the agreement on cooperation between border regions 
and that this was the reason it was not endorsed. 
  As regards the expectations of the Polish side, I would like 
to ask you if the agreement on the protection of investments or 
the agreement on the prevention of double taxation, which are 
not far from completion, could be offered as a substitute. I 
believe in you, Mr. Prime Minister, that, owing to the pressing 
circumstances that I have mentioned, you will carry out 
necessary steps for our joint contribution to the successful 
implementation of the tasks of Slovak foreign policy. 
  I thank you in advance for cooperation and understanding. 
  In the context of that letter, I would like to say that I 
do not know anything about the results of talks between the 
Slovak president and Polish President Walesa during the 
president's visit to Poland or during their visit to Prague. 
[passage omitted] 
  Acting on the basis of the letter, I took all of the steps 
to 
meet the minister's--pardon me, the president's--request. I 
asked ministers to brief me about their progress in their tasks. 
An agreement on environmental cooperation was prepared to be 
signed, but, in mid-December, the Polish side presented us with 
a unilateral alternative proposal not previously assessed by the 
Slovak Government, and we have a lot of objections to it. An 
agreement on cooperation of border regions was not approved by 
the government because we are not satisfied with it. Among other 
things, it did not define, for instance, what is the territory 
of border regions, and thus, in fact, this term might be applied 
to the entire territory of one or the other side to the 
agreement. It also included other serious legal and political 
mistakes. It is true that the drafting of an agreement on 
prevention of double taxation and other agreements have 
considerably progressed, but within the three working days that 
were available to us, it was not possible to correct things and 
finalize the drafts without consultations with the Polish side. 
  On the basis of these facts, I sent the following letter to 
the president on 24 January 1994: 
  Esteemed Mr. President: 
  The Government of the Slovak Republic is determined to give 
you all-around support in order to make all of your foreign 
trips properly prepared and successful. 
  Together with Ivan Gasparovic, the chairman of the National 
Council of the Slovak Republic, we have already been pointing 
out for some time now that you need to coordinate your foreign 
trips, including the entourage, if you are interested in being 
accompanied by members of the government. A foreign working 
trip by a member of the government has to be approved by the 
Slovak Government. Without such an approval, he cannot leave the 
country. 
  Next time, plan your matters more in advance. The government 
should be informed about them in time if agreements between the 
governments, for the drafting of which the government of the 
Slovak Republic is responsible, are to be signed. 
  During my visit to Prague, a meeting between the prime 
ministers of the Slovak Republic and the Polish Republic took 
place. At the meeting, Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak 
asked for a meeting between the members of the Slovak and Polish 
Governments to take place not in January 1994 but later. We 
agreed on this. The course of action you took contradicts this 
agreement between the prime ministers of the Slovak Republic and 
the Polish Republic. 
  Despite the above-mentioned, the Slovak Government approved 
a 
visit by Environment Minister Jozef Zlocha to Poland. However, 
the agreement will still be subject to discussion as in 
December, new amendments were sent by the Polish side to the 
already discussed agreement, and we have not yet taken them into 
account. As far as other agreements you propose for signing 
during your visit to Poland are concerned, though their drafting 
has progressed a great deal, they are not yet ready for approval 
and signing. 
  I am making an urgent appeal for improving cooperation with 
the Slovak Government. I leave it to you to reconsider whether 
in this situation you insist that Environment Minister Zlocha is 
among the members of your entourage, taking into account also a 
stance by the Polish prime minister. Economy Minister Jan 
Ducky's trip was not approved by the government, and this is why 
he will not take part in the trip to Poland. 
  Yours respectfully, 
  [signed] Meciar [passage omitted] 
  During talks in Prague, the Polish prime minister turned to 
the Slovak Government delegation with a plea, explaining that he 
has such pressing duties in his country that he does not 
consider any meeting between the members of the government of 
the two sides in January to be suitable. We agreed only on a 
meeting between his adviser and the Slovak Deputy Prime Minister 
Jozef Prokes on the territory of the Slovak Republic. As the 
proposal for a meeting was made by the Slovak side with great 
urgency, the Polish side agreed to hold an informal one-day 
meeting between government members, probably in the Tatras 
mountains, to discuss cooperation questions. [passage omitted] 
  The course of action chosen by the President's Office is not 
a usual one, but we are not entitled to express our view on it 
or to control it. This is a matter for you, the National Council 
of the Slovak Republic. 
  It is up to you to assess what has happened. The government 
has done all it should have and could have done in the given 
situation to assure the success of the president's foreign trip. 
[passage omitted] 
  As I have already taken the floor, and, as there are 
various pieces of information voiced by the media and in public, 
allow me to brief you about yet another thing, not because it 
involves me but because that action or its content are aimed at 
grossly damaging the interests of the Slovak Republic and its 
policy, as well as the Government of the Slovak Republic. 
[passage omitted] 
  I assess the letter [allegedly sent by Yugoslav former Prime 
Minister Milan Panic] to be one of a number of provocations 
aimed partly against me, which is not important, and against the 
Slovak Republic. [passage omitted] 
  This is a matter concerning the state. Following an attempt 
to subvert our state or its economy by forging a large number of 
stamped [Czechoslovak] bank notes, this is yet another one of a 
big number of provocations constantly being carried out against 
Slovakia. 
  As far as insults against me are concerned, I have forgiven 
the past ones--as you sitting on the right at the back benches 
well know, and I will also forgive these. I only regret that 
hate toward me has led toward acts against the interests of our 
state, toward acts damaging them. [passage omitted] 
  To put our state in danger of having to face international 
isolation, international sanctions for not complying with the 
embargo, I am afraid I cannot find a polite expression to 
describe this. [passage omitted] 
  I want to say that our state has been internationally 
recognized but provocations against it took place, are taking 
place, and will continue to take place. As regards all those 
who are in a state of euphoria that we have already overcome all 
problems, I would like to draw their attention to the fact that 
we have not yet overcome anything. Nothing has been solved, 
nothing has been completed. Either we will unite behind our 
aims, fighting for them and protecting them together, or these 
purposeful provocations--and others about which we have at 
present received some preliminary intelligence information that 
they might be in the process of being prepared--can bring about 
the situations that will be substantially more complicated and 
more difficult. 
  Therefore, consider your every step, your every statement 
and 
political stance! Much is still ahead of us, and it will not be 
the last thing we have to overcome. 
  Thank you for your attention. [applause] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Complete text of the documents adopted by the Association </F>
of Towns and Communities of Zitny Island at its assembly in 
Komarno on 8 January: "The Points of View Adopted by the 
Association of Towns and Communities of Zitny Island"] 
  [Text] The assembly held in Komarno on 8 January 1994 
attended by local self-administration deputies, town and village 
mayors, and parliamentary deputies from South Slovakia adopted a 
series of documents, which we are publishing in full. Above 
all, we think that their relevance also depends on their 
sponsors' obligation not to stray from the bounds defined in 
them in the future. 
<H5>  A General Point of View (Introduction) </H5>
  The members of the local self-administrations, town and 
village mayors, and parliamentary deputies--the elected 
representatives of Hungarians in Slovakia--publish the following 
point of view from their assembly in Komarno on 8 January 1994: 
  Following the political changes after November 1989, 
Hungarians in Slovakia manifested their support for political 
pluralism, parliamentary democracy, and the execution of the 
principle of self-administration in two parliamentary elections 
and in the elections to local representative bodies. 
  The Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement-Egyutteles 
coalition currently has 14 deputies in the National Council of 
the Slovak Republic. These movements highlighted as a priority 
task in their election programs improving the legal status of 
Hungarians in Slovakia. There are 5,000 Hungarian deputies and 
roughly 400 Hungarian mayors in town and community 
self-administrations. 
  According to the 1991 census, more than 600,000 inhabitants 
with Hungarian as their mother tongue live in Slovakia--that is, 
11.5 percent of the total population. Members of the Hungarian 
community make up the majority in 437 towns and villages and 
account for 10-50 percent of the population in another 85 towns 
and villages. These 522 towns and villages are located in a 
continuous--compact--territory along the southern border of the 
Slovak Republic. Almost 98 percent of the Hungarians in 
Slovakia live on this territory and account for almost 70 
percent of the population here. Apart from this, there is a 
sizable number--1,000-20,000--of Hungarians in another four 
cities. 
  The sociological surveys that have been carried out 
regularly 
since October 1990 indicate that a high percentage of the 
Hungarian population in the Slovak Republic supports 
parliamentary democracy. Compared with the rest of the 
population, xenophobia and anti-Semitism are less characteristic 
among the Hungarians, and they also display the greatest 
tolerance toward other people. The attitude of Hungarians 
toward Slovaks is positive, and the sociological surveys show 
that the Slovaks who live among them feel the same. 
  The participants in the assembly want in the future to 
enhance the community of Hungarians in Slovakia, and also the 
territories where Hungarians and Slovaks live together, on these 
foundations. The participants in the assembly realize that the 
basis for social peace, development, and human affluence is a 
peaceful relationship, regulated by law, between members of 
different nationalities. This is a prerequisite for ensuring 
that structural changes in policy and the economy take place as 
quickly as possible in Central Europe and that the countries of 
this region can integrate themselves into the European Union. 
  Following the collapse of the communist system, the citizens 
and governments of the former communist states, as well as the 
whole of Europe, face new tasks: creating a new system for 
security and stability in Europe that would make it possible to 
forestall local and regional conflicts and also creating the 
basic prerequisites for expanding European integration toward 
the former communist countries. 
  The Central European region is, among other things, 
characterized by biased attitudes and pent-up tension that could 
result in tragic conflicts. We will do all we can to ensure 
that such a conflict does not break out in the Carpathian basin. 
However, it is necessary to point out that it is also essential 
to deal with the ethnic problems here. 
  In Slovakia, which gained its independence in 1993, this 
means that it is necessary to establish relations between 
Slovaks and Hungarians on new foundations. In the interest of 
this, it is necessary to create a new system for relations 
between Slovaks and Hungarians and to adopt new laws. The 
measures adopted by the government so far have contributed to 
worsening mutual relations. The new system of relations should 
strengthen the basic pillars of democracy: the system of 
self-administrations, a law-governed state, and a 
constitutional-legal status for the ethnic communities. 
  The participants in the assembly therefore express their 
point of view on three fundamental issues. 

<H5>    The Constitutional and Legal Status of Hungarians </H5>
  The participants in the assembly assert that the Hungarian 
population in Slovakia, despite some repression and pressure 
under the totalitarian regime and after World War II and other 
attempts to ethnically homogenize the population, has maintained 
its ability to express again its political subjectivity, to 
organize its community, and to preserve the original settlement 
structure on the territories where it has lived for thousands of 
years as an autochthonous community and, in most cases, has also 
formed the majority of the local population. Proceeding from 
this, the Hungarian population in Slovakia defines itself as a 
national community resolved to struggle to ensure that, apart 
from the individual rights that should pertain to everyone, its 
community rights are recognized and that its status as a 
community is enshrined in the Constitution. 
  At the same time, they proceed from the UN resolution 
according to which the right of individuals and collectives to 
preserve their own identity is one of the basic human rights. 
Their conviction that political and cultural 
self-identification and self-determination within the framework 
of the state is a basic right of the Hungarian national 
community is inherent in this. 
  The participants in the assembly proclaim the following: For 
the development of the ethnic Hungarian community in Slovakia, 
it is essential that: 
--In places where Hungarians account for at least 10 percent 
of the population, they can use their mother tongue, orally and 
in writing, in contacts with state bodies or, as the case may 
be, in public administration and have a right to the designation 
of public areas and to public information in Hungarian. 
  --In places where Hungarians make up the majority of the 
population, Hungarian is the official language alongside Slovak. 
  --The Slovak Republic signs and ratifies the European 
Charter 
on Regional or Minority Languages. 
  --The representation of Hungarians in state bodies and 
public 
institutions corresponds to their number. 
  --The Hungarian community receives a fair allocation from 
the 
state budget or, alternatively, from the budget for 
self-administrations in accordance with its size. 
  The participants in the assembly proclaim that Hungarians in 
Slovakia, proceeding from the principle of civic equality: 
  --Want to establish the Slovak Republic along with the 
Slovak 
people as an equal community. 
  --Want, in accordance with the draft constitutional law 
prepared by deputies from the Hungarian coalition, to express 
their political subjectivity via their own representative bodies 
that will evolve from democratic elections. 
  --Demand, in the interest of maintaining their own identity, 
the recognition of a special legal status for the territory 
where a considerable number of Hungarians live. 
  The participants in the assembly express their conviction 
that one of the fundamental elements of equality is thorough 
adherence to the principle of mutuality. This means that, in 
regions, towns, or communities in which members of one 
nationality or inhabitants with the same mother tongue are in 
the minority, they have a legally guaranteed right to an 
education in their mother tongue, a right to use their mother 
tongue, and the right to acquire and disseminate information in 
their mother tongue. As far as these rights are concerned, the 
given community should have the right of agreement in relation 
to the regional self-administration and the state 
administration. This means that it should not be possible to 
make a decision on these issues without the agreement of this 
community. 
  The participants in the assembly proclaim that implementing 
these principles within the Slovak Republic, an equivalent 
status for the Hungarian national community and the Slovak 
nation with respect to its state-forming capacity and the 
application of rights serves to bolster the statehood and 
territorial integrity of the Slovak Republic and to create a 
democratic law-governed state. 
<H5>  The Jurisdiction of the Self-Administrations </H5>
  The participants in the assembly realize that one of the 
basic pillars of a law-governed state is a system of 
self-administrations equipped with broad powers; this is a 
framework in which citizens have an opportunity to 
democratically express their will and to oversee the 
implementation of their interests and respect for human rights 
and freedoms. 
  The participants in the assembly state that the rights of 
the 
self-administrations in the Slovak Republic are inadequate. The 
development of the self-administrations comes up against 
obstacles, their rights are deliberately curtailed, central 
power is being increased to the detriment of the 
self-administrations, and the bodies of the state administration 
are being given superiority over them. The chapter in the 
Slovak Constitution on territorial self-administrations 
(Articles 64-71) contains only general statements. These 
principles may thus manifest themselves in a completely 
distorted manner both in laws and in practice. 
  The participants in the assembly consider it essential that 
the powers of the self-administrations be unequivocally defined 
by law--that is, that a territorial system be created within 
whose framework a self-administration's bodies will run their 
affairs by utilizing the predominant part of the taxes according 
to the values produced on the given territory and will guarantee 
the democratic self-regulation and self-administration of the 
local population. 
  In the interest of this: 
  1. The Slovak Republic should sign as soon as possible the 
agreement on affiliation to the European Charter on Local Self- 
Administrations. The basic ideas behind it are as follows: 
increasing democracy, decentralizing power, subsidiarity, and 
the sworn and public acceptance of undertakings by the 
contracting parties. 
  2. The declaration on affiliation to the European Charter on 
Local Self-Administrations should contain at least 20 points 
from Article 12, among which should feature the following--to 
us--important points: 
  --Article 2, enshrining the rights of the local 
self-administrations in the Constitution and laws. 
  --Article 3, Paragraph 1, dealing with the overwhelming 
majority of public issues at a local level. 
  --Article 4, Paragraph 3, the body that is territorially 
closest to the citizen should be responsible for dealing with 
public matters. 
  --Article 4, Paragraph 4, complete and exclusive authority 
for the local bodies. 
  --Article 5, the unchangeability of the 
self-administration's 
borders without the agreement of the population. 
  --Article 8, Paragraph 1, supervision of the activity of 
self-administrations should be regulated by law. 
  --Article 9, Paragraph 2, the appropriate financial cover 
for 
their activity in harmony with their powers. 
  --Article 10, Paragraph 1, the right of the 
self-administrations to form associations. 
  --Article 10, Paragraph 2, the right of the 
self-administrations to join international associations. 
  --Article 11, protection of the free execution of rights 
should be guaranteed by the courts. 
  3. In the interest of legal certitude, the following should 
be itemized in the Constitution: the system of 
self-administrations, their jurisdiction and authority, or, 
alternatively, their unalterability by means of other legal 
norms. 
  4. The following should be expressed in the Constitution in 
detail: the system of self-administrations, their jurisdiction 
and authority. 
  5. Before the implementation of the new system for the 
country's territorial-administrative division, it is necessary 
to create, in accordance with Chapter 2, Article 64 of the 
Slovak Republic Constitution, larger territorial units, on the 
basis of a voluntary association of self-administrations, that 
will come under the jurisdiction of the future territorial 
self-administrations. At the same time, it is necessary to 
respect Council of Europe recommendation No. 1201. 
  6. In harmony with Chapter 3, Article 4 of the European 
Charter on Local Self-Administrations, it is necessary to 
constitutionally outline the complete and exclusive powers of 
the self-administrations. Thus, it is necessary to guarantee 
that these powers cannot be curbed by regulations from central 
or regional bodies. 
  7. In the interest of decentralizing power, rationalizing 
the 
state administration, and increasing responsibility beneficial 
to the public by transferring power from state administration 
bodies to the self-administrations, it is necessary to bring 
administration closer to the citizen and to expand the 
constitutional authority of the self-administrations, especially 
in the spheres of education, culture, health care, public 
safety, and the environment. 
  8. It is also necessary to coordinate the material, 
economic, 
and financial conditions necessary for the self-administrations' 
functioning with the powers and responsibility of the 
self-administrations. All of the property and real estate 
located in the community should be ceded to the local 
self-administration in cases where the owner is not known. 
  From the point of view of establishing a democratic legal 
order, legal certitude, and a law-governed state, we consider it 
expedient--respectively, executable and necessary in the 
interest of stability--for the National Council to adopt laws on 
the self-administrations with a three-fifths majority. In the 
case of the self-administrations of the (ethnic) minorities, 
they should be guaranteed the right to veto the execution of 
rulings that are disadvantageous to them, since so-called 
numerical democracy, by its very essence, cannot guarantee the 
widespread execution of the interests of those in the minority. 

<H5>    The Administrative Reorganization of Slovakia </H5>
  The assembly participants take the following as their point 
of departure: 
  --The state forms the framework for the realization and 
protection of fundamental human rights and freedoms. 
  --The territorial and administrative arrangement in the 
country should be based on an integral system of the execution 
of public administration, and the most important elements of the 
arrangement are the following: a decentralized state 
administration, economy of the administration, and service to 
the principal interests of the citizens. 
  The assembly participants believe that the present system of 
public administration in the Slovak Republic conforms to neither 
the European requirements nor the requirements of the local 
population because it is uneconomical and heavy-handed, with an 
overgrown bureaucracy; the decisionmaking process is very 
complicated; and its powers are not clearly defined. The 
distribution of power among the bodies of the state 
administration and the local self-governing administrations is 
not rational. The system of territorially integrated state 
administration authorities with definite powers conflicts with 
local interests. The government has been planning a 
reorganization of the public administration system since 1990. 
Attempts at decentralization were initially made within the 
framework of this plan. Today, however, the centralization 
tendencies, which serve the interests of the central power, are 
again gaining in prominence. 
  The assembly participants declare the following: 
  1. The proposal made by the government does not suit most 
local self-governing administrations in Slovakia. For the 
Hungarian community, this plan is unacceptable, in addition to 
the general objections, because the region inhabited by the 
Hungarian community would be divided into five administrative 
sections, and that would result in a complete marginality of the 
Hungarians, which in turn would render a solution to the actual 
problems impossible. This would facilitate organized 
assimilation. 
  2. When constituting administrative regions and bodies of 
state administration in the country, it is necessary to build on 
the principle of legal security guarantees and a two-tier system 
of public administration. 
  3. The new public administration structure must be formed, 
while respecting the principle that public affairs should be 
managed by a body that is territorially closest to the citizens. 
In present-day Slovakia, this means that, in addition to the 
self-governing administrations, the first tier of the state 
administration should be constituted on the territory of the 
already existing (or similar) domains of the state 
administration. The first tier of the state administration 
should receive all such administrative powers as needed to deal 
with all official business in the given region, including the 
transfer of powers from the present authorities with specific 
powers. Concurrently, it is necessary to close down the present 
district offices of the state administration. 
  4. When creating the second tier of the administrative 
regions and bodies of the state administration, it is necessary 
to build on the principle that they are to be constituted within 
the framework of the territorial units that arose by a voluntary 
integration of the (local) self-governing administrations. 
  5. The reorganization of the territorial arrangement and the 
state administration should respect the fundamental interests of 
the Hungarian national community: 
  --That its region of habitation is not divided among several 
constitutional units, in which the Hungarian community would 
become a marginal minority, without any chance of promoting its 
interests, and would not have the opportunity to participate in 
dealing with matters that concern it. 
  --Such a constitutional arrangement is acceptable for the 
Hungarian national community, as long as it does not assume the 
position of a minority (in terms of strength) in the territories 
on which many of its members live. 
  --That Article 11 of Recommendation No. 1201 by the 
Parliamentary Assembly of the European Council be observed in 
the territorial and administrative reorganization, according to 
which: 
  In the areas where the members of ethnic minorities live in 
significant numbers, they have the right to special a legal 
status or to local or autonomous bodies of public 
administration, which correspond to the historical and local 
specific features of the given community and are in harmony with 
the legislation of the given state. 
  The legitimacy of these demands is confirmed by the 
following 
data: 
  According to the 1991 census, the cities and villages 
populated by members of the Hungarian national community in 
Slovakia can be put into three categories: 
  a) Majority regions: cities and villages in which Hungarians 
form at least 50 percent of the population. There are 432 
cities and villages with 437,727 inhabitants of Hungarian 
nationality in this category. 
  b) Minority regions: cities and villages in which the share 
of Hungarians is over 10 percent but less than 50 percent. 
There are 90 cities and villages (the Hungarians live in a 
relative majority in five of them) in this category, with 83,125 
inhabitants of Hungarian nationality . 
  c) Regions in which Hungarians live dispersed: cities and 
villages in which the share of Hungarians does not reach 10 
percent but their absolute number exceeds 100 people. There are 
28 cities and villages (the number of Hungarians is 39,519) in 
this category, while, in four cities (Bratislava, Kosice, Nitra, 
Velky Krtis), 1,000-20,000 Hungarians live. 
  The assembly participants propose the following: 
  1. The second-tier public administration should conform to 
the territorial entities that emerge from the voluntary 
association of the cities and villages of categories a) and b) 
(majority and minority regions). 
  We believe that there are two feasible solutions: 
  a) To form one homogeneous territorial administrative 
entity--region: from the territory below Bratislava as far as 
Kosice, and then, after a short interruption, southern Zemplin 
and the area between Uh and Latorica (Medzibodrozie). There are 
511 cities and villages in this area with a population of 
824,946, of which 507,073 are Hungarians (61.46 percent). 
  b) To form three administrative entities--regions: from 
Bratislava to Sahy: population of 526,620, of which 331,704 are 
inhabitants of Hungarian nationality (66.11 percent), 250 cities 
and villages--southern Zemplin and the area between Uh and 
Latorica: population of 58,985, of which 45,576 are inhabitants 
of Hungarian nationality (77.27 percent), 53 cities and villages. 
  The Hungarian linguistic island below Nitra should form a 
special territory (first tier administrative region) formed of 
18 communities with the Hungarian population 12,895 (51 percent 
of the total) strong. 
  2. At the offices within the framework of the first- and 
second-tier administrative units with special powers, formed 
according to the aforementioned principle, the law should 
guarantee the possibility of dealing with official matters in 
both languages orally or in writing. 
  3. From the vantage point of the authority and powers, the 
system of institutions in the framework of the territorial and 
administrative entities should be compatible throughout 
Slovakia. The territories inhabited by Hungarians or by members 
of other national minorities, however, should form an exception 
and have special legal status. 
  The assembly participants consider it necessary that the 
aforementioned principles and views be implemented in the 
territorial and administrative reorganization of the country. 
It would contribute to the reinforcement of the inner stability 
and social peace. 
<H3>  The Possibilities for the Economic Development of the 
Self-Administrative Regions </H3>
  The structural changes in the economy and the transition to 
a 
market economy have highlighted the economic differences between 
the individual regions. During the past four years, some 
regions have found themselves in a severe economic crisis and 
have major problems with unemployment. 
  The area of South Slovakia inhabited by Hungarians is also 
among these regions. The unemployment level here far exceeds 
the nationwide average and, what is more, districts with a 
Hungarian population are among the areas with the highest level 
of unemployment. 
  According to the official figures, the level of unemployment 
in Slovakia on 31 October 1993 was 13.8 percent. However, on 
the same date, the unemployment level in the Dunajska Streda 
District was 20.1 percent. It was 19.2 percent in Galanta; 21.0 
percent in the Komarno District; 20.8 percent in 
Kosice-Environs; 15.5 percent in the Levice District; 19.0 
percent in the Lucenec District; 17.5 percent in the Nove Zamky 
District; 23.7 percent in the Rimavska Sobota District; 21.3 
percent in the Roznava District; 19.0 percent in the Trebisov 
District; and 19.8 percent in the Velky Krtis District. 
  One of the main reasons for the economic problems in 
territories with a Hungarian population is the one-track 
branch-by-branch structure [jednostranna odvetvova struktura]. 
The economy of this territory is determined by agriculture and 
by the services linked to it, to a degree, by the food industry; 
all of these are considered to be crisis branches. The 
one-track branch-by-branch structure of the economy in these 
territories is the result of Czech economic policy during the 
First Republic. In addition to this, in the 1950's--at the 
beginning of Slovakia's industrialization--only rarely were 
industrial enterprises founded on these territories and, from 
the ecological point of view, the new plants mostly had an 
negative impact. Plants such as, for example, the Duslo 
chemical plant in Sala, the paper plant in Sturovo, the nuclear 
power plant in Mochovce, the hydroelectricity plant in 
Gabcikovo, or the heating plant in Vojany. 
  Responsibility for the economic stagnation or, rather, the 
economic decline on these territories is borne by the 
Czechoslovak state and the Slovak political leadership. To 
rectify these mistakes, it is necessary for these regions to 
become regions with an independent administration. In this way, 
their population will finally have an opportunity to control the 
economic development of their own region in accordance with 
their own economic policy, and, at the same time, they will also 
be responsible for it. 
  Autonomy for the self-administrative regions is relative; it 
may exist within broad limits: from a formal 
self-administration to a factual self-administration, which 
means the possibility of independent decisionmaking in important 
issues affecting life within the given region. Of course, the 
aim is to achieve factual autonomy--that is, 
self-administrations in the broadest sense of the word, 
self-administrations in which there are great opportunities to 
develop the economy, politics, culture, education, and ecology 
on the territory of the given region. 
  It is necessary to emphasize: If, on the territories with a 
predominantly Hungarian population, we demand the creation of 
regions with their own self-administration, this does not mean 
that we would want to isolate ourselves from the Slovak economy. 
What we intend by the better utilization of what we have and 
the comparative advantages of the individual regions is to 
strengthen the national economy of the whole of Slovakia. 
  From the economic point of view, the creation of these 
regions is important because it makes it possible: 
  --To draft and implement regional programs and concepts for 
economic development that accept and utilize the comparative 
advantages of the individual regions and lead to the elimination 
of the current one-track branch-by-branch structure. 
  --To attract foreign capital and organize foreign 
development 
programs. 
  --To sign agreements on regional cooperation with regions in 
the country and outside it. 
  --To introduce regional and local taxes as a backup for that 
apportionment of state taxes it is possible to utilize for 
regional development. 
  --To utilize financial sources (funds) provided from the 
state budget for the development of the given region. 
  It is particularly necessary to mention the institutional 
possibilities for regional economic development. These are: 
  --Regional chambers of trade and industry. 
  --Regional specialist associations. 
  --Regional banks and insurance companies. 
  --Regional institutions for economic development (offices, 
agencies). 
  Regional economic development can only be successful if we 
understand that this is a long-term process and we approach it 
accordingly, if we implement it with commitment, if the 
organizers are personally interested in it, if it is based on 
discovering and using the internal potential and comparative 
advantages of the regions, and if the development strategy is 
adapted systematically to potential and needs. 
  An organic element of the political and economic changes at 
the moment is the redivision of Slovakia into administrative and 
self-administrative units. In the new territorial division, it 
is unnecessary to proceed in accordance with the principle of 
divide et impera, but it is necessary to create viable units so 
that the whole--the country--is also enhanced. This aim may be 
achieved by creating regions while taking into consideration 
historical traditions, natural regional units, and economic 
potential so that the energy of sound local patriotism, the 
cohesive strength of the inhabitants of the given region, and 
their endeavor for self-realization, their instinct to establish 
their right to existence, and their desire to achieve success 
are all utilized.

<F P=106> [Article by editor Agata Stanekova on the regular briefing </F>
at the Slovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs] 
  [Text] Mrs. Daniela Rozgonova briefed us today on the 
following statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the 
Slovak Republic: 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers it natural and 
understandable that Hungarian political circles and the general 
public follow with interest political and social developments in 
the neighboring Slovak Republic. It has, however, met with less 
understanding when the information of the governmental Office 
for the Hungarian National Minorities Abroad misinterprets a 
resolution of the Slovak parliament--the parliament of a 
neighboring country--on the basis of which doubts could be cast 
about whether the Slovak Republic really wants to observe the 
pledges it adopted when joining the Council of Europe. 
  In this statement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs again 
informs its partners, including the government bodies of the 
Hungarian Republic, that the Slovak Republic will gradually 
fulfill all of the pledges it took in connection with joining 
the Council of Europe. As is known, the implementation of these 
pledges is being assessed by the Council of Europe. At the same 
time, the Slovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejects any general 
and unsubstantiated accusations that the Slovak Republic is not 
observing the obligations following from the CSCE documents. 
  Journalists also wanted to know why Minister Moravcik did 
not 
take part in the Slovak delegation's visit to Poland. This was 
agreed with the Polish partner due to the fact that the Polish 
foreign minister was on a visit to the United States. The two 
foreign ministers are to meet at a different date. 
  In connection with the alleged letter from [former FRY Prime 
Minister] Milan Panic to Prime Minister Meciar, the 
representatives of the Foreign Ministry confirmed the statement 
by Jozef Moravcik yesterday. They said that, in connection with 
the possible export of weapons, the ministry is publishing its 
view on the aspects of this with regard to international law and 
that no export can take place without a decision by the ministry.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Bratislava REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 25 
January publishes three commentaries in reaction to statements 
by Sandor Lezsak, executive chairman of the Hungarian Democratic 
Forum [MDF], about the situation of the Hungarian minority, made 
during his recent three-day visit to Slovakia, held at the 
invitation of the Hungarian minority's Coexistence Movement. 
  Bratislava REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 25 January on page 3 
carries a 450-word Dominik Hurny commentary entitled "Boundless 
Ruthlessness." The commentary takes issue with Lezsak's 
statement that, "as long as the basic rights of citizens of 
Hungarian nationality in Slovakia are not guaranteed, it is 
impossible to speak about a Hungarian-Slovak settlement--that 
is, about the signing of an interstate treaty." Hurny asks: 
"What basic rights do the Hungarian citizens of Slovakia not 
have? Do they have no schools and periodicals, are they 
forbidden to speak Hungarian, do they not have their own radio 
and television broadcasts and bilingual names of streets and 
shops? What are they being denied--church services in Hungarian, 
the use of Hungarian in dealings with the authorities in 
southern Slovakia? What is being denied to them in comparison 
with Hungary and its minorities? Who gave Mr. Lezsak the right 
to declare in Slovakia that Hungarian citizens in Slovakia do 
not have basic rights?" After denouncing Lezsak's assertions as 
a "lie" and "boundless ruthlessness," the commentator goes on to 
challenge "Messrs. Duray, Bugar, and Nagy," the leaders of the 
Hungarian parties in Slovakia, "to state in public which basic 
rights the Hungarian population of Slovakia does not have and in 
which areas Hungarian legislation and, above all, the Hungarian 
practice vis-a-vis the Slovak and other minorities is better and 
of a higher standard than is the case in Slovakia." He says: 
"It is necessary to ask Messrs. Duray, Bugar, and Nagy to 
furnish evidence for their propaganda attacks, which run counter 
to reality. We know very well who in southern Slovakia is 
threatened with assimilation! As long as Mr. Duray and company 
do not try to specify their attacks, any further talks are 
superfluous. The government must demand from these muckrakers a 
clear answer to the question of their alleged basic rights. 
There can be no talk of a dialogue until then." 
  On the same page, REPUBLIKA carries a 600-word Eva 
Zelenayova 
commentary entitled "And Who Will Protect the Citizen?" 
Commenting on the MDF delegation's visit to southern Slovakia, 
Zelenayova says: "During the delegation's first stop, at 
Kralovsky Chlmec, Stefan Pasztor, the mayor of that city, let 
himself be heard that Hungarians in Medzibodrozi [area between 
the Uh and Latorica Rivers in east Slovakia] are not free and 
that the government does not take care of them, which is why 
they have to help themselves. The guests from Hungary, in turn, 
stated that they are fulfilling their electoral program, which 
includes taking care of Hungarians beyond the borders of the 
Hungarian Republic. At his news conference on Sunday [23 
January], MDF Executive Chairman Sandor Lezsak went so far as to 
term the Komarno rally [of 8 January, at which Hungarian 
minority representatives formulated their demands] the beginning 
of efforts at a Slovak-Hungarian settlement, which, however, is 
still a long way off, in his opinion, because the basic human 
rights of the Hungarian minority are not guaranteed in the 
Slovak Republic.... We could scarcely find a state in Europe 
that would let its sovereignty be jeopardized the way we allow 
our southern neighbors to do this. They are not alone, receiving 
substantial help from their notoriously known lackeys in our own 
country. By their statements and initiatives, they jeopardize 
and offend with impunity the state and its population. 
Meanwhile, the General Prosecutor's Office is silent, and the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not sent a single protest note 
yet. Quite the contrary, we are being generous and assume an 
accommodating stand, imprudently and to our own detriment." In 
concluding, Zelenayova calls on the government "to act as the 
government of a sovereign state so that the citizen will not 
have to fear about who will protect him." 
  On the same day, on page 1, REPUBLIKA carries a 400-word 
editorial by Roman Kalisky entitled "Public Matter." According 
to the author, telephones had been ringing in the REPUBLIKA 
editorial office "since yesterday morning," with "indignant 
readers" asking how it is possible that "a foreign politician 
can present ultimatums," speaking about the impossibility of a 
Hungarian-Slovak reconciliation "as long as the basic rights of 
the Hungarian minority are not recognized in Slovakia," and 
accuse Slovak representatives of trying to "provoke Hungarians 
living in Slovakia." Kalisky continues: "What could I tell 
them? I advised them: Phone the Slovak Government, the 
minister of interior, the General Prosecutor's Office! Because 
I know that they are not going to phone them, let me tell these 
institutions on the callers' behalf: 
  "Esteemed gentlemen, governmental and nongovernmental Slovak 
politicians! 
  "In every sovereign state from Albania to the United States, 
from New Zealand to Zaire, a foreign state representative such 
as Sandor Lezak [Slovak spelling of Lezsak's name used] would 
get in his passport the `persona non grata' stamp. And the 
matter would be settled! 
  "Second, every citizen of the Slovak Republic who flagrantly 
establishes contact with the representative of a foreign power 
with the aim of subverting this Republic should be made 
criminally liable!" In this context, Kalisky reiterates his 
earlier call for the adoption of a "law on the protection of the 
Republic" to be applied against "conspiratorial criminal acts 
directed against the state, such as are being publicly committed 
against the Slovak Republic today." 
  Lezsak's visit to Slovakia is also the subject of a 
statement 
made by Docent Jan Cuper from the Theory of State and Law 
Department of Comenius University's Law School to the Slovak 
news agency TA SR, which is published by Bratislava NARODNA 
OBRODA in Slovak on 25 January on page 2. The TA SR report on 
Cuper's statement includes the following passage: "Referring to 
Sandor Lezsak's tour of southern Slovakia, Jan Cuper said that 
the naivete of the Slovak state power is being quietly abused in 
this way in order to prove that Budapest has sovereignty over 
southern Slovakia. It is no coincidence that the tour did not 
start in Komarno this time but, rather, in Kralovsky Chlmec in 
the east, Jan Cuper said, adding that `if you are not acting 
like a sovereign subject, you will not be treated like a 
sovereign subject. It is not customary for someone who is not 
yet the winner to set preliminary conditions for someone who has 
not yet been defeated and to blackmail him.' According to Jan 
Cuper, the developments are aimed at the Hungarian minority 
being granted autonomy rights, so as to make possible the 
establishment of Hungarian state power in southern Slovakia."

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak on 
25 January on page 11 carries a 1,200-word interview with 
Vladimir Stefko, director of Slovak Radio, by Valeria Koszoruova 
entitled "Disobedient Radio?" In the interview, the place and 
date of which are not given, Stefko blames the government's 
interference in Slovak Radio's commercial activities for the 
institution's difficult economic situation. 
  In his initial reply, Stefko discusses Slovak Radio's past 
efforts to reduce its dependence on the state budget by 
developing its own commercial activities. In this context, he 
says: "In 1992, for example, Slovak Radio's economic result was 
41.5 million korunas better than projected. Last year, the 
situation changed dramatically for the worse, owing mainly to 
state interference. The state reduced the majority of Slovak 
Radio's commercial activities. At the same time, it halted the 
state subsidy, in contravention of National Council of the 
Slovak Republic Law Number 14. This was done by the same bodies 
that in December 1991 called on Slovak Radio to step up its 
commercial activities in order to ease the burden on the state 
budget and that promised us the retention of the improved 
economic result (that is, 41.5 million korunas) to cover parts 
of the budget that the state was unable to fund. Slovak Radio 
was deprived of about 80 million korunas in this way, and, in 
1993, for the first time in its history, it ended the year with 
debts. The bulk of them are owed to Slovak Telecommunications, 
of which Slovak Radio is one of the main customers." 
  Whereas, in the past, Slovak Radio had three different 
sources of revenue, Stefko says--subscription fees, state 
subsidies, and income from commercial activities--now it must 
make do with subscription fees, which are constantly declining. 
In this context, he notes that, even though there are 1.9 
million households with at least one radio set in Slovakia, 
according to official statistics, Slovak Radio receives fees 
from only 1,000,016 subscribers. Stefko attributes the decline 
to the deteriorating social situation of households and to 
loopholes in the legislation, which do not make it possible to 
track down and fine nonpayers. 
  Citing a specific example of "interference" in Slovak 
Radio's 
commercial activities, Stefko mentions the decision of the 
Ministry of Transportation and Communications to ban broadcasts 
by the Austrian-owned Radio CD International from Slovak 
territory. According to Stefko, the cooperation agreement with 
the Austrian partner guaranteed Slovak Radio an annual income of 
52 million Slovak korunas. He points out that "depriving Slovak 
Radio of money" was the sole aim of this ban, which, he says, 
"also met with a very negative response on the Austrian 
political scene." 
  Further on, Stefko explains the "austerity measures" being 
applied by Slovak Radio as of 17 January, in connection with the 
introduction of a new programming structure, which include a 
reduction in the number of radio stations to three. In spite of 
these austerity measures, Stefko says, Slovak Radio's costs will 
exceed its revenues by 84 million korunas this year. He warns 
that the "intervention against the radio undermines the 
foundations of Slovak culture" because cultural and educational 
programs are affected most severely of all. He mentions, for 
example, that Slovak Radio may be forced to give up its 
orchestra, which costs 18 million korunas a year and earns only 
about 5 million korunas. 
  Stefko also points to Slovak Radio's ambivalent legal 
status, 
which makes it possible for the government to treat it the way 
it does. He says: "Law number 255 states that Slovak Radio is 
managed as a subsidized organization. At the same time, 
according to the same law, it can be entered in the company 
register and has the right to engage in entrepreneurial 
activity. Hence, we are controlled like a subsidized 
organization, but, on the other hand, we are not being provided 
with financial resources like a subsidized organization. 
Everybody uses this [ambivalence] the way it suits him."

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "Scope Is Being Created for Corruption; </F>
Opposition Parties on the Law on Large-Scale Privatization"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--At their meeting in Bratislava 
yesterday, the deputy chairmen of the parliamentary opposition 
parties adopted a statement on the proposed amendment to the Law 
on Large-Scale Privatization. The statement was presented to 
journalists by Ivan Simko, deputy chairman of the Christian 
Democratic Movement [KDH]. 
  In the statement, the opposition parties that attended the 
meeting--the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], the KDH, the 
Alliance of Democrats of the Slovak Republic, Coexistence, and 
the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement--note that, instead 
of becoming an economic instrument of the transformation 
process, privatization has become a political means to 
concentrate power. Unless changes are made to eliminate the 
danger of privatization being abused at the forthcoming meeting 
of parliament, scope for corruption will be created. The 
opposition parties will support such changes as will make 
privatization more transparent and effective and prevent its 
misuse. They expect deputies representing the governing 
coalition to realize their responsibility toward their voters 
and to endorse those changes, the statement by the parliamentary 
nongovernment parties states. 
  Regarding the KDH's initiative to pass a vote of no 
confidence in Roman Hofbauer, minister of transportation, 
communications, and public works, Ivan Simko announced that 
signatures are still being collected. He believes that it will 
be possible to raise this issue in the course of the forthcoming 
meeting of the National Council of the Slovak Republic. SDL 
Deputy Chairwoman Alzbeta Borzova told the TA SR correspondent 
that the SDL has "commissioned an analysis" on the extent to 
which Roman Hofbauer's procedures correspond to "the principle 
of rationality." The SDL's view on this matter has not yet 
become crystallized, she said.

<F P=106> [Article by Christian Democratic Party Spokesman Ondrej </F>
Turek: The Czechs and NATO Entry"] 
  [Text] Some domestic commentators have joined the foreign 
critics of the approach taken by the Czech Government, which 
refused all notions of a joint, or at least a coordinated, 
approach by the Visegrad Four countries to NATO. Terms like 
"arrogance" and a "mean trick" are flying about, together with 
appeals for solidarity and warnings that by this attitude we may 
lose our last allies. Nevertheless, these daring statements are 
not based on any rational arguments. However, it is precisely 
rational thinking and a cool head that we most need today in the 
tumultuous region of Europe, particularly in its Eastern and 
Central parts. 
  The stand of the Czech Republic is not a struggle for petty 
prestige, as one reporter called it, but responsible behavior. 
If we succumbed to pressures for a close coordination of the 
approach to NATO with all of the Visegrad countries, we would be 
making an error. Unfortunately, it is true that we are more 
likely to become NATO members after we manage to separate 
ourselves from the irrational vision of a Visegrad self-help 
association, after no one dares to include the Czech Republic in 
East Europe, and after we really prove that we are a prosperous, 
and especially a stable, democratic state. I believe it is 
better to have as a partner, even if relatively later, the 
entire Western civilization than, immediately, several 
unreliable riders en route to the same destination. I am sorry, 
but Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary have let themselves be pushed 
into the role of three drowning men who are trying to grasp the 
coattails of a fourth one. The representatives of the Czech 
Republic, however, do not belong to those who cannot realize 
that three drowning men are too much for one rescuer. It must 
be hoped that the drowning men know how to swim, at least a 
little. 
  Someone could object: What about our sense of solidarity? 
Should we help them, after all? I believe that the notion of 
solidarity is not at all appropriate in the present situation. 
How can we help Hungary, Poland, or Slovakia? How else but 
verbally? I believe that no one wants us to condition our 
admission into NATO Samaritan-like by a [demand for] the 
simultaneous admission of all of the other Visegrad partners. 
That would be an inexcusable gamble with the security of the 
Republic because such a statement would slow down our admission 
into NATO. It could even block it completely because who knows 
what is going to happen in East Europe over the next few years? 
  Claims have also been made, as another argument for the 
coordination of the proceeding of the Visegrad Four, that, after 
the partition of Czechoslovakia, the West does not want to 
tolerate any further disintegration of the Central European 
region. I do not understand what the issue is here. In the 
instance of the partition of Czechoslovakia, it was an execution 
of the will expressed by the majority of citizens in the 1992 
elections, a commendable avoidance of a Yugoslav-type tragedy, 
and simply an act that is impossible not to respect, one that 
must be commended. 
  And the unwillingness to dissolve the Visegrad Four? This 
fear is again rather irrational and not at all supported by the 
evidence. Are the Western countries at all interested in 
maintaining an integral bloc in the Central European region? 
Could the Polish or the Slovak elections, for instance, or the 
expected outcome of the elections in Hungary have changed 
something in their attitude? If so, would the possible interest 
in keeping the Visegrad countries close together be in or, 
rather, against the interests of the Czech Republic--that is, 
against expeditious admission to NATO? 
  It is interesting that all of the consequential foreign 
policy makers in the Czech Republic--the president, the prime 
minister, and the foreign minister--have reached a rare accord 
regarding the approach to NATO. It shows that, when the going 
gets tough, when Czech national interests are at stake, the 
political representatives can unite. The guarantee of the 
security of the state and, therefore, admission to NATO really 
is the number-one national interest.

  [Excerpt] At its session in the Kolodeje district of Prague 
today, the Czech Government reached an agreement on general 
principles of one single document on the concept of the reform 
of the territorial administrative setup. This was announced by 
Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus at the end of the session. He 
added that there was no fundamental dispute among the four 
coalition parties about the powers of the higher-level 
territorial administrative entities. The ministers agreed, 
above all, on powers to be transferred from central bodies to 
regional bodies and on the principle that regional 
self-administration bodies would not deprive villages of their 
current powers. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sarajevo, Jan 26 (AFP) -- Bosnian Prime Minister 
Haris Silajdzic called Wednesday for bomb attacks on groups 
which seek to prevent aid convoys from reaching their 
destinations. He made the call after civilians shot and wounded 
six policemen escorting a UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees] aid convoy in central Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Speaking alongside the new commander of UN forces in Bosnia, 
British General Michael Rose, with whom he had held a short 
session of talks, Silajdzic said: 
  "People are dying of hunger while some people block roads. 
Whether they are Serb, Croat or Bosnian, they should be bombed 
because they're killing the population through hunger.... 
Freeing up aid corridors is the key issue, anything else is of 
secondary importance." 
  He regretted that although UN forces on the ground sought to 
help, the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) did "not have the 
mandate." 
  Rose, who took over the troubled UN command on Monday amid 
acrimonious debate on how the international community should end 
the conflict here, refused to comment on the Bosnian's remarks. 
  But he said that earlier, during his first meeting with 
Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic, he had assured Ganic the UN 
force "would do all it could to continue to facilitate the 
delivery of humanitarian aid and to assist with the peace 
process in this country". 
  "I don't think in the near future we are going to see any 
changes in the mandate I have been given," he added. 
  Earlier Wednesday, six Bosnian policemen were shot and 
wounded as the UNHCR aid convoy they were escorting came under 
fire from civilians in central Bosnia, a spokesman for UNHCR 
said here. 
  Another policeman was wounded by civilian fire Tuesday in 
the 
same circumstances and in the same area, UNHCR spokesman Kris 
Janowski said, adding that the Zenica-Kakanj road had been 
closed after the two attacks. 
  The attacks took place in the village of Ticici, near 
Kakanj, 
60 kilometres (35 miles) northwest of Sarajevo, in an area 
controlled by the Moslem-dominated Bosnian army. 
  The UNHCR convoy heading toward Tuzla and accompanied by 12 
Bosnian policemen was stopped by civilians at Ticici, where 
gunfire coming from one of the houses hit and wounded six of the 
policemen. The police escort had been strengthened after the 
first armed attack on Tuesday, Janowski said. 
  In the Tuesday incident, the convoy had left Zenica, 70 
kilometres (44 miles) northwest of the capital, for Kakanj with 
a five-man Bosnian police escort Tuesday morning. It was 
stopped near Ticici by a crowd of some 300 Moslem men, women and 
children. 
  Janowski said the UNHCR was "very worried" about the growing 
number of incidents aimed at UN convoys over the past few weeks. 
  Since the beginning of January, several UNHCR aid convoys 
have been blocked in central Bosnia. The crowds blocking the 
convoys, usually made up of women and children, often managed to 
flee with part of the aid. Much of the region's population is 
suffering from food shortages.

  [Text] General Michael Rose, new commander of the UN 
forces for Bosnia-Herzegovina, today talked with Presidency 
Member Ejup Ganic, Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, and Army 
General Rasim Delic. Here is a report by Nedzad Leko: 
  [Begin recording] [Leko] General Michael Rose was first 
received by Presidency Member Ejup Ganic. After the talks, Dr. 
Ganic told foreign and domestic journalists the following: 
  [Ganic in English fading into Serbo-Croatian translation] 
Speaking on behalf of the Presidency, I informed General Rose 
that we are going to do everything with a view to helping his 
mission here. Everybody knows that the humanitarian situation 
is very tragic and we hope that the UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] troops headed by the general will act efficiently, 
protect the humanitarian convoys, and deliver food to the 
population, and we ourselves are going to do everything to help. 
We do not want UN troops to be treated badly and are encouraging 
Gen. Rose to act efficiently and do everything necessary. 
  We also touched upon other issues such as Tuzla Airport and 
other details. Of course, peace negotiations were one of the 
topics and we stressed that if clear political principles for 
negotiations are not formulated, Geneva will continue being a 
mere media zoo. Therefore, we hope that the clear political 
principles that were defined at the London conference will be 
confirmed in order for us to be able to continue political talks. 
  [Leko] Gen. Rose commented very briefly on the talks he had 
with Dr. Ganic: 
  [Rose in English fading into Serbo-Croatian translation] We 
had a very useful conversation. We initiated a large number of 
issues. I told Dr. Ganic that UNPROFOR will do the best it can 
with a view to continuing to help the delivery of humanitarian 
aid and to help the peace process in this country. 
  [Leko] One of the questions for Gen. Rose was whether one 
can expect some change in the UNPROFOR mandate with his arrival. 
  [Rose in English fading into Serbo-Croatian translation] I 
do not think that we are going to see any changes in the mandate 
I received in the near future. 
  [Leko] Today, Gen. Rose also talked with Prime Minister 
Haris Silajdzic and with Hasan Muratovic, chairman of the State 
Commission for Relations with the United Nations. After the 
formal part of Gen. Rose's visit, Dr. Silajdzic told the 
journalist the following: 
  [Silajdzic] I will say only one thing: The most important 
thing is the humanitarian convoys, that is, how are we to clear 
the corridors for humanitarian convoys. I think that this is 
the key question and we are going to talk about it now. 
Everything else is of marginal importance at this moment. 
Therefore, freeing corridors for humanitarian convoys is the 
basic thing we are talking about. We are now going to continue 
the talks. 
  [Leko] In reply to the question asked by foreign journalists 
on whether he expects essential changes in UNPROFOR activity 
with Gen. Rose's arrival, Dr. Silajdzic said the following: 
  [Silajdzic in English fading into Serbo-Croatian 
translation] 
As far as I can understand, the mandate has not changed and 
unfortunately, as much as they would like to help, they do not 
have the mandate to do so. Therefore the problem is that the 
aggression on Bosnia-Herzegovina is taken for granted. We are 
just the other side in the conflict. The victim and aggressor 
are equal. The killed and the killer are the same. Why? 
Because nobody wants to interfere. The West has become a group 
of noninterfering countries. Democracy and morality are 
attacked in Bosnia, if that means anything to anybody. Our 
principles are attacked and we are seen only as a side in a 
conflict. The guns around Sarajevo and civilians waiting to be 
shelled are seen as one and the same thing. I think I have said 
enough. 
  [Leko] Would you like to see the roads for the passage of 
convoys freed by military action, foreign journalists asked Dr. 
Silajdzic. 
  [Silajdzic in English fading into Serbo-Croatian 
translation] 
We would like to see convoys pass because people are hungry, 
people are dying, while some other people are blocking the 
convoys' passage. Therefore, whoever is blocking convoys -- be 
it Bosnians, Serbs, or Croats -- should be attacked because they 
are killing people with starvation. 
  [Leko] During their meeting today, Army General Rasim Delic 
informed Gen. Rose about the situation on the battlefield, the 
humanitarian situation, and the cause of the conflicts in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The two generals also talked about the 
problems of implementing the agreements signed so far, as well 
as resolutions that have been adopted without instruments for 
their implementation being developed. 
  Gen. Rose presented the aim of his mission, as well as 
activities he is planning for the coming period. I want to help 
the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, particularly in the delivery 
of humanitarian aid. In doing so I will do everything with the 
means and forces I have at my disposal, Gen. Rose stressed at 
the end of today's talks. [end recording]

  [Text] Sarajevo, Jan 26 (TANJUG) -- Bosnia-Herzegovina's 
warring Moslems, Serbs and Croats signed late on Wednesday a 
declaration undertaking to protect the power facilities in this 
war-torn former Yugoslav Republic. 
  Bosnian Serb Vice-President Nikola Koljevic told reporters 
after the first round of talks at Sarajevo Airport that the 
document regulated all power disruptions in territories 
controlled by all three sides. 
  The talks at Sarajevo Airport are part of an effort to 
rebuild confidence among Bosnia's warring nations. 
  No agreement has been reached on another major issue -- the 
release of five Serb doctors and three nurses arrested by the 
Moslems in Sarajevo last week in an alleged attempt to flee a 
Moslem-controlled quarter of the city. 
  "This issue should demonstrate the good will of the (Moslem) 
side, and we regret to say that we shall be unable to accept any 
agreement until this major issue has been resolved," said 
Koljevic. 
  General Milan Gvero, assistant commander of the Bosnian Serb 
Army, said the Moslem military authorities had been asked to 
publicly withdraw their declaration of war on the Serbs in these 
lands and to clearly call off all military operations, as 
insistence on confidence-building is senseless if combat 
operations continue.

  [Text] A new meeting of the Group for Restoring Mutual 
Confidence, which consists of representatives of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Government and the Serbian and Croatian 
sides, was held at Sarajevo airport today. After our delegation 
returned from the meeting, Emir Brackovic interviewed Haris 
Silajdzic, prime minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Begin recording] [Brackovic] Prime Minister, in your 
statement yesterday you, in a way, announced today's meeting of 
the Group for Restoring Mutual Confidence. This is a new group, 
a new form of attempting [words indistinct] in a way. 
  [Silajdzic] Yes, this group had a meeting today. The 
meeting lasted for somewhat shorter time today. Mr. Akmadzic 
also attended today's meeting. The meeting dealt with two 
groups of topics. They were military and humanitarian topics. 
Regarding military topics, those touched upon were direct 
telephone lines and (?something) was agreed upon -- soldiers 
will (?certainly) be able to tell it better: meetings, regular 
meetings of commanders, joint military commissions. Then we 
went over to humanitarian issues, that is, the issue of convoys 
and the issue of electricity. Regarding electrical power, we 
drafted and signed an agreement by which the sides oblige 
themselves firstly that they will not destroy power lines, that 
they will in no way hamper the flow of electricity, as well as 
that the repair of and resumption of work on the following lines 
will be undertaken urgently: Jablanica-Kakanj, Travnik-Novi 
Travnik-Nova Bila, Visegrad-Gorazde-Foca, as well as Lepenica, 
Visegrad-Zvornik, and finally the powerline near (?Zepce). 
Therefore, these are the six lines that should be repaired as 
soon as possible. There is also the repair that had been agreed 
upon, but which has failed five times -- that along the line of 
Buca Potok-Reljevo, that is, at Perivoj. We agreed upon this 
today, firmly agreed that the repair of that part should begin 
immediately. Here, this is a concrete result. 
  [Brackovic] Is the group going to meet again before 10 
February? 
  [Silajdzic] It should meet on 5 February, but we shall see 
at what level. 
  [Brackovic] Is the Croatian side included in all these 
commissions and groups for humanitarian issues? 
  [Silajdzic] All right, you are obviously well informed. 
Yes, the Croatian side is now also included in the commissions 
working on humanitarian issues, the issues of cooperation 
regarding electricity, gas and so on. So far it was not 
included, but as of now it will be. 
  [Brackovic] Have you had bilateral meetings with [word 
indistinct] the Croatian side and can you [words indistinct]? 
  [Silajdzic] There were bilateral meetings with both sides. 
These were mostly political talks about which I can say that 
they were not particularly productive. Regarding these issues, 
we are obviously turning around in a circle and we are obviously 
not going to get out of it in this way, even though all the 
sides had good intentions. What is involved are simply 
different political options, different military options, so that 
there is no result. This does not mean that one should not talk 
and, for that very reason, we are talking. 
  [Brackovic] Thank you very much. 
  [Silajdzic] Not at all.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 27 January carries in 
its regular 10-minute newscast several reports on the fighting 
in the republic. 
  Hajrudin Sermic reports from Maglaj that "one of the 
heaviest 
days of war is behind the people of Maglaj, at least in terms of 
the number of shells fired at the positions of the fighters of 
the 201st Brigade and the villages on the free territory. Three 
tank and infantry attacks were repelled in the Pazaric, Sedra, 
and (Rovin) area along the newly established defense positions, 
even though the chetniks and the ustasha fired over 2,000 shells 
from their rich arsenal. However, the fighters of the 201st 
Chivalrous Brigade again demonstrated heroism, morale, and 
patriotism, and repulsed all the attacks." The report says that 
"in order to justify the great losses in his ranks, and to 
reduce at least to some extent the panic felt by his fighters 
and the people of Zepa, Lozancic, commander of the treacherous 
111th HVO Zepa Brigade, has been deceiving the public on 
Croatian Radio by claiming that they have captured some point or 
another. But that is a lie as his fighters have not advanced a 
single millimeter, nor will they. They can only move backward." 
  Reporting from Brcko, Hamiz Deronjic says that "the attacks 
on the free Brcko territory are not letting up. After futile 
attempts yesterday at infiltrating sabotage groups in white 
camouflage uniforms behind our lines, the [Serb] enemy 
intensified the shelling of the Brcko defense lines and the 
civilian targets inside the free territory. Vranovaca was again 
exposed to the heaviest artillery attacks. This stronghold near 
Brcko, which was of extreme strategic importance even in World 
War II, is one of the main targets of the Serbian aggressor in 
this offensive. Last night Vranovaca was pounded with 
howitzers, tanks, 60-mm, 82-mm, and 120-mm mortars, Praga, and 
Bofors guns." The report says that "at the same time the 
aggressor was bringing in reinforcements to Lipovac, Donja Brka, 
and Cadjavac. The large forces that the aggressor has amassed 
on the Brcko front do not seem to be having the least effect on 
the low morale of the chetniks. Interchetnik clashes have been 
escalating into armed conflicts with increasing frequency. Last 
night at 1945 [1845 GMT] the chetniks from Stari Brod and Donja 
Brka fired at each other with small arms, and later even threw 
hand grenades at each other's positions. Last night there were 
also small arms fire exchanges among the chetniks in the 
Cadjavac region." 
  Describing the situation in Sarajevo, the studio announcer 
says that "early this morning the chetniks started an artillery 
barrage against the city. Howitzer shells and mortars fired 
from Krivoglavci landed at Point 850, Jezera, and Vis. From the 
direction of Okruglica four howitzer shells were fired at the 
Jewish cemetery, while a howitzer from Metalka fired at Kobilja 
Glava. At just after 0700 the aggressor in Nedzarici fired 
mortars at Dobrinja, and artillery shells fired from Gavrica 
Brdo landed on Donji Kotorac and Butmir."

  [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1400 GMT on 26 January within its 
regular 30-minute newscast carries several reports on the 
fighting in the republic. 
  Hajrudin Sermic reports from the Maglaj Commune Press Center 
on the "fierce chetnik and ustasha tank and infantry attacks 
that begun early this morning and gained in intensity and 
ferocity at about 1100 [1000 GMT]. More than 1,500 projectiles 
from tanks, howitzers, multiple rocket launchers, guns, and 
mortars of all kinds and calibers have been launched thus far on 
our defenders' positions with the support of Praga weapons and 
antiaircraft machine-guns and antiaircraft guns. Fire from more 
than 60 heavy and armored weapons was opened from all 
directions: Teslic, Doboj, Ozren, and Zepce." Finally, Sermic 
adds that "as I report, strong artillery preparation for the 
third breakthrough attempt is going on." 
  Smail Terzic reports from the 7-South Operation Group zone 
that "civilian targets have been shelled in the districts of 
Mrkotic, Kalosevic, [word indistinct], and Jelovci. The 
shelling has been going on for several hours." 
  Studio announcer Milorad Filoni reads a report by the 1st 
Corps Information Service according to which "on the Sarajevo 
battlefield, the shelling of defense lines and the city itself 
continued in the early afternoon hours. Mortar bombs were 
falling in the region of Stupsko Brdo and Bosut and shells 
launched from Nedjarici were falling on Dobrinja." Finally, 
Filoni says that "about 1345, chetniks from Paljevi and 
Krivoglavci launched a fierce artillery attack at the general 
region of Zuc."

  [Excerpt] After launching a vicious attack this morning 
from the direction of Maglaj against positions held by the 
Croatian Defense Council [HVO] in the area of Lijesnica and 
Cehajic, the Muslim army mounted a combined artillery and 
infantry assault in the area of Dolina from the direction of 
Zavidovici. 
  After three hours of ferocious fighting, members of the 
(Marko Praljic) battalion managed to disperse the enemy army. 
Three Muslim soldiers, including one Iranian mojahid, were 
killed on this occasion and their bodies have remained on the 
territory controlled by the HVO. A considerable quantity of 
arms was captured as well. 
  At noon the Muslims began an attack in the region of Brezova 
Kosa and Krsic from the direction of Zeljezno Polje in the 
western sector of the Zepce front. The fighting is still under 
way and the defenders are repelling all the aggressor's attacks. 
  The most difficult situation today is on the Maglaj front. 
After repulsing an attempted infantry spearhead into Croat 
villages in the Bosna river valley near Maglaj, members of the 
Zepce brigade launched a counterattack and succeeded in taking a 
very important strategic point from which their firepower can 
control access to the Natronka factory where the Muslims have 
been manufacturing arms for quite some time now. [passage

  [Text] Bratunac, Jan 26 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslem troops 
continued and intensified on Wednesday attacks in several 
directions on the positions and settlements of Bosnian Serbs, 
Bosnian Serb Republic army sources reported. 
  According to the same sources, Moslem forces fired from 
infantry arms, grenade launchars, snipers and mortars on the 
Serbian districts of Sarajevo -- Grbavica, Dobrinja one and 
Dobrinja four, Lukavica, Nedjarice, Ilidza, Vogosca and Rajlovac. 
  It is further said that Moslems have renewed attacks on the 
Serbian settlement of Zlatiste near Sarajevo, trying to cut off 
traffic between Sarajevo and Pale, the political and military 
headquarters of Bosnian Serbs in the vicinity of the capital 
city of the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Intensified Moslem attacks have also been registered in the 
region of Doboj, Ozren, Maglaj and Zavidovici, while Moslem 
armed provocations persisted near the Teslic, Vlasic, Gradac and 
Trebava battlefields (central Bosnia-Herzegovina). 
  There is no peace either in the region of Gorazde, a Moslem 
enclave in eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina which has been under U.N. 
protection, where Moslem forces persist with their attacks on 
neighbouring Serbian towns of Foca, Cajnice and Ustikolina. 
  Moslem units in the region of Kladanj and Kalesija, in 
eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina, also continued their 
artillery-infantry operations against the Serbian side, Bosnian 
Serb sources said.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The 4 January issue of the Zagreb weekly 
DANAS in Serbo-Croatian publishes on pages 22-24 an article on 
the founding of Bosanska Posavina. DANAS states that the local 
Croats established the province despite the opposition of the 
Herceg-Bosna leadership. The weekly explains that the 
Owen-Stoltenberg plan, which called for only a small portion of 
Bosanska Posavina to be given to the Bosnian Croat republic, was 
the greatest motive for the establishment of Bosanska Posavina's 
autonomy. Every Bosanska Posavina resident will agree with this, 
DANAS states, adding that in comparison to the Vance-Owen plan, 
the Owen-Stoltenberg plan "was the sheer destruction of one of 
the most compact Croatian territories in Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
In contrast to the Vance-Owen plan, which called for the 
Bosanski Brod, Odzak, Bosanski Samac, and Orasje municipalities, 
as well as parts of the Derventa, Doboj, Modrica, Gradacac, and 
Brcko municipalities, to be included in the Croatian-majority 
province, the Owen-Stoltenberg plan gave the Croats only 
two-and-one-half municipalities, DANAS observes. This is why 
the Posavina residents decided at a general assembly recently 
held in Slavonski Brod to "return to a kind of Vance-Owen plan." 
The assembly made the decision to establish the province of 
Bosanska Posavina incorporating the municipalities of Bosanski 
Brod, Bosanski Samac, Derventa, Modrica, Odzak, and Orasje and 
parts of Brcko, Doboj, and Gradacac. According to the 1991 
census, Croats were a majority in this region, with 59.6 percent 
of the population, followed by Serbs with 20.5 percent and 
Muslims with 15.5 percent. Other nationalities made up 4.4 
percent of the population. "Now that the plan for the union of 
Posavina municipalities into a special territorial-political 
body has become a reality, its supporters are not pleased to be 
compared to Fikret Abdic," DANAS states, adding that the reason 
for this is not because the founding of their province is 
different from that of the Autonomous Province of Western 
Bosnia, but because they do not want to be viewed as the 
creators of a conflict among the Croatian people similar to the 
intra-Muslim conflict in the Autonomous Province of Western 
Bosnia. The essential difference between the two is that the 
Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia has hostile relations with 
the Muslim leadership in Sarajevo, while Bosanska Posavina 
intends to maintain equally good relations with Alija 
Izetbegovic and Mate Boban, DANAS concludes.

<F P=106> [Report by Wojciech Pomianowski from Berlin: "Foretaste of </F>
Membership; Ministers and Experts After NATO Summit"] 
  [Text] "Partnership for Peace" is not a substitute 
for Central and East European countries' membership in NATO -- 
such is the message coming out of a Berlin conference on 
European security which ended Tuesday [25 January]. 
  At the invitation of Federal Defense Minister Volker Ruehe 
of 
Germany, the conference participants -- defense ministers and 
deputy defense ministers, experts, scientists, and journalists 
from 14 countries -- assessed the results of the recent NATO 
summit and the "Partnership for Peace" program. 
  The Berlin meeting had an informal nature but it is regarded 
by political circles as significant from the standpoint of 
shaping public opinion. It was the first meeting of this kind 
after the recent NATO summit and it was important for countries 
of Central and East Europe -- including Poland -- because it 
served the purpose of providing information on positions taken 
by the individual countries. 
  The participants at the Berlin meeting unanimously agreed 
that the outcome of the NATO summit is positive. There were 
differences of opinion with regard to assessing the role of 
"Partnership for Peace." Representatives of the countries of 
East and Central Europe which are making efforts to become NATO 
members emphasized that the "Partnership" program should be 
regarded as a step on the way to membership in NATO. 
  Such a view was aired among others by the Polish Deputy 
Defense Minister Jerzy Milewski. He said "Partnership for 
Peace" is a kind of program which should well serve to prepare 
Poland soon for full NATO membership. But Milewski also 
stressed that what is also needed is political protection 
against political dangers which are occurring. Such a 
protective shield could be provided by the status of associate 
NATO or Western European Union membership, or at least the 
function of an observer in NATO's political agencies. A Euro- 
Atlantic security system is indispensable in the future which 
would be based on volunteer membership by countries of North 
America and Europe, including Belarus, Ukraine, and the Baltic 
states. Such an alliance should then sign a treaty of 
cooperation with Russia. 
  Speaking before Polish journalists, Minister Milewski said 
that the position he presented was received with quite a bit of 
support among conference participants. Similar views were 
expressed -- among others -- by the Slovak defense minister and 
the Hungarian deputy minister. A different position was taken 
by Russia's representative -- Sergey Karaganov who is a deputy 
director at the European Institute of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences and an advisor to President Yeltsin. He said widening 
NATO to cover the area all the way to the Russian border would 
create the danger of a military, economic, and social isolation 
of his country for many years to come. 
  According to Minister Milewski, Germany is currently our 
most 
important partner in implementing the goal of European unity and 
Poland's integration with the European Union and with NATO. 
Jerzy Milewski talked in Berlin among others to Jorg Schoenbohm 
-- a secretary of state in the Federal Defense Ministry -- about 
bilateral cooperation between the two countries' defense 
ministries against the context of European processes and the 
"Partnership for Peace" program.

  [Text] Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky met 
representatives of [ethnic] Serbs in Hungary today. Before his 
departure to Yugoslavia on Thursday [27 January] he wanted to 
gather information on their situation, to be able to forward 
their possible request to Belgrade. Kata Peli Nagy reports. 
  [Peli Nagy] The Serbs of Hungary are also interested in the 
improvement of Serbian-Hungarian relations because they affect 
the situation of Serbs in Hungary in a favorable way. 
Therefore, Hungary's Serb minority of several thousand 
unanimously welcomes Jeszenszky's Belgrade visit, which is to 
take place the day after tomorrow. The chairman and deputy 
chairman of the Democratic Association of Serbs in Hungary told 
"Chronicle" a few minutes before the beginning of the 
ministerial meeting: The embargo against Serbia has made keeping 
contacts with the mother country much more difficult. The 
situation of teachers who came here to work is unresolved, 
cultural cooperation is difficult, and links which had been in 
place have partly been interrupted. 
  If Jeszenszky intends to receive information on the 
situation 
of Hungary's Serbs--numbering about 5,000 to 10,000--the two 
representatives will raise, among other things, the question of 
constitutional cultural autonomy, since the Minority Law 
declares the right to cultural autonomy, but the rights of 
minorities in connection with this are unclear. To establish 
autonomy there is a need for a network of cultural institutions 
and, first and foremost, money. Peter Lasic, the deputy 
chairman of the association, said that, in their view, the 
return of Serb church properties would be delayed and the 
financial situation of the single Serb secondary school should 
be resolved as well, particularly since the split of the 
Serbo-Croat educational institution. 
  The Serb minority representatives, as it is expected to 
happen in Belgrade too, will probably raise the unsettled matter 
of parliamentary representation [of minorities] as well.

  [Excerpts] Slovak President Michal Kovac is continuing his 
official visit to Poland. [passage omitted] 
  This afternoon he had talks with the president of the Polish 
National Bank and then he met with journalists. Our 
correspondent Michal Michalcik was present at the news 
conference: 
  [Michalcik] [passage omitted] One of the questions was why 
no 
Polish-Slovak agreements were signed during this visit. 
President Kovac admitted that there were plans to sign two 
agreements. Last Tuesday, however, the Slovak Government 
neither approved them nor was in a position to approve them: 
they were still not ready. [passage omitted] 
  Another question was why [Slovak] Economy Minister Ducky did 
not come to Warsaw Michal Kovac said on this topic: 
  [Begin Kovac recording] Naturally, I am upset by the fact 
that the government has not agreed to Mr. Ducky's participation, 
but this changes nothing about the importance and the nature of 
my visit, because whether these agreements are signed during my 
visit or Prime Minister Pawlak's visit to the Slovak Republic, 
or on a different occasion, is not so important, in my opinion. 
  I do not think that there is poor communication with regard 
to the preparation of the president's foreign visits. It is 
possible that the prime minister was not properly informed that 
coordination was taking place between the Foreign Ministry and 
the president's office--specifically, its foreign policy 
department. Coordination usually does not take the form of the 
president and the prime minister meeting the foreign minister 
and saying: When are we going, where, and how? This is prepared 
usually by institutions on the basis of various invitations we 
have received or made. In my opinion, with regard to this 
visit, coordination was as it should have been. It might not 
have been good between the Foreign Ministry and the government 
office--views were not united, or proper information was not 
released on which agreements would and would not be prepared. 
[end recording] 
  One of the questions was, naturally, about Milan Panic's 
letter. President Kovac said on this topic that this is a gross 
provocation against Slovakia. He showed journalists a statement 
the president's office sent to the Slovak press agency, TASR.

<F P=106> [Interview with Michael Zantovsky, ambassador to the United </F>
States, by Jana Smidova; place and date not given: "Czech-U.S. 
Relations Are Not Encumbered by Serious Problems"] 
  [Text] Czech Ambassador to the United States Michael 
Zantovsky returned home in connection with the visit of 
President Clinton. He remained in Prague longer than the U.S. 
President and, before his return to the United States, granted 
LIDOVE NOVINY an interview on Clinton's visit and on relations 
between the Czech Republic and the United States. 
  [Smidova] These relations give the impression of being like 
a staunch friendship between the Czech and the U.S. people. Are 
there any problems here at all? 
  [Zantovsky] The only place where there are no contentious 
issues is heaven. I consider that we are managing, regardless 
of the change in the U.S. Administration, to maintain an 
atmosphere of intense friendship to be paramount. This is 
something of an exception in normal contacts between states. 
The fact that the preparation of treaties, such as on the 
taxation agreement, is a matter for discussion is also part of 
such a close relationship. It falls to diplomacy, however, to 
allay any differences. Nonetheless, I am unaware of any serious 
problems in mutual relations. 
  [Smidova] Some time has already passed since Clinton's 
visit. What is your assessment, after such a short time, of its 
significance? 
  [Zantovsky] The visit was extremely useful for us, according 
to both our own assessment and the reactions from around the 
world. The Partnership for Peace plan was at the center of 
attention, but, apart from this dominant issue, the visit 
enabled us to gauge U.S. views on the Central European region, 
the Czech Republic, and U.S. policy toward Russia in the 
security sphere. It also gave us sufficient opportunity to 
acquaint the United States with Czech views on the issue. The 
situation seems different up close than it does from overseas. 
  The fact that millions of Americans had an opportunity to 
get 
to know our capital city and to see the U.S. President in Prague 
is also not insignificant. This is something that can be put to 
very good use and that, of course, we will use, whether in the 
tourism or the investment spheres. The results of Clinton's 
visit can simply be turned into ready money. 
  [Smidova] The U.S. President often travels all over the 
world. In your opinion, was this visit something special, or was 
it just a routine visit to a small Central European country? 
  [Zantovsky] It is true that U.S. presidents travel all over 
the world, but, in President Clinton's case, this was his first 
visit to Europe and thus, of course, his first mission in the 
Central European region. This visit more or less dispelled the 
speculation that U.S. attention is turning away from Europe and 
that it will be focused on only the Pacific region. This was an 
important signal and confirmation of the continuing U.S. 
interest in Europe and in the stability and security of Central 
Europe. 
  [Smidova] The Partnership for Peace plan is being assessed 
in various ways. Some see it as a mere gesture, while others see 
it as a well-thought-out and forward-looking strategy. What is 
your personal opinion? 
  [Zantovsky] It is essential to realize that, since November, 
when outgoing Defense Secretary Aspin formulated this idea for 
the first time, its contents have changed considerably. This 
was also confirmed in Prague by President Clinton--that is, the 
issue is not whether the Czech Republic and the other countries 
of Central and East Europe will join NATO, but when and how. 
And that is per se very important. If, however, anyone 
imagined that we would be given automatic security guarantees 
immediately without any effort on our part, the plan will indeed 
mean very little to him. The Partnership opens the way for 
specific possibilities that, given our endeavor, will in the 
foreseeable future--in a few years--actually lead to the 
structure of the Czech Armed Forces becoming more compatible 
with that of the NATO armies. This, in turn, will lead to a very 
intense exchange of personnel, their coordination, and policy 
planning. And, last but not least, even the guarantee of 
consultations contained in Article 4 of the Washington Treaty is 
not insignificant. This is not, of course, a complete security 
policy. Nevertheless, any potential aggressor has to take into 
consideration the fact that this element exists. As far as I am 
concerned, the success of this plan depends primarily on us. 
After several decades in which we did not have any influence on 
our own security, no matter what we did, this is an invaluable 
factor. 
  [Smidova] A Czech expatriate, U.S. Ambassador to the 
United Nations M. Albright, played a significant role in the 
Clinton visit. Do you think she kept her fingers crossed more 
for us than for the other postcommunist countries? 
  [Zantovsky] It would certainly be naive to think that Mrs. 
Albright is our man in the U.S. Administration, even though, 
during Clinton's visit, commentaries were published joking that 
now, with Karel Kovanda presiding over the Security Council, the 
Czech Republic is the only country in the world with two 
representatives on this body. Mrs. Albright is, first of all, a 
U.S. politician, someone who very assiduously defends White 
House policy and U.S. interests in general. It is invaluable 
for us that, in view of her origins, she is acquainted in detail 
and professionally with the political trends and situation not 
only in our country, but also throughout postcommunist Europe. 
Her views may be an asset to the U.S. President and 
Administration and, thus, also to us. It is not by chance that 
President Clinton sent her on a trip to all of the 
posttotalitarian countries before his visit, although, from a 
purely bureaucratic point of view, this was not her task. This 
was an expression of his faith in her knowledge of the region. 
  [Smidova] In connection with asserting Czech interests in 
the United States, it is said that the Czech lobby is weak and 
that it does not have the same influence as the Polish or 
Hungarian special-interest groups.... 
  [Zantovsky] Reference is often made to this. The situation 
is, after all, somewhat different from the Polish exiles because 
the Czechs arrived in several distinct waves. These are people 
who brought with them an image of their homeland belonging to 
their own time. Therefore, it is sometimes difficult for them 
to share the same views on an issue. Despite this, a number of 
expatriates are very actively helping the Czech Republic, among 
other things, by supporting its interests in political circles. 
Above all, I would mention Charles Vanik, the coauthor of the 
Jackson-Vanik amendment. Moreover, the national lobby is not the 
only or necessarily the most effective force that could act on 
our behalf in U.S. politics. It is equally important for us 
that, owing to the influx of U.S. investment in the Czech 
Republic, there are now a number of businessmen in the United 
States interested in ensuring that we are successful, that they 
are successful with us, and that relations between the two 
countries are the best they can be. These people appeal 
actively to their congressmen. This is another force on which 
we can rely.

  [Text] Sarajevo, Jan 27 (AFP) -- Bosnian Croat forces 
Thursday prevented the UN from evacuating ill civilians from the 
Moslem sector of Mostar, in southern Bosnia-Herzegovina, a 
spokesman for the UN High Commission for Refugees [UNHCR] said. 
  Spokesman Kris Janowski said the evacuation of 22 patients 
and 16 of their relatives had to be called off after the Croat 
forces (HVO) [Croatian Defense Council] failed to give 
authorisation for it to go ahead. 
  Among the ill was a five-year-old girl with bone cancer who 
needed urgent medical attention, he said. 
  A spokeman for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) meanwhile 
said intense fighting broke out Wednesday between the 
mainly-Moslem Bosnian Army and the HVO at Fojnica, 40 kilometers 
(25 miles) west of here. 
  Spokesman Idesbald van Biesebroeck said UN military 
observers 
who reported renewed clashes between Bosnian-controlled Fojnica 
and the Croat-held town of Bakovici, three kilometers (two 
miles) away, had no further details. 
  The new outbreak of fighting came after Croat forces Monday 
recaptured the Moslem village of Here, near Prozor, 30 
kilometers (20 miles) south of Fojnica. 
  The village has great strategic significance for the defense 
of Jablanica and Konjic, towns under Bosnian control, and for 
communication between Sarajevo and central Bosnia. 
  The mountainous village of Here and two others held by 
Bosnian forces, Kute and Scipe, stand along a road built by 
Croat forces to link Kiseljak, 30 kilometers west of Sarajevo, 
to western Herzegovina, which they control. 
  UN observers also reported renewed exchanges of light and 
heavy automatic gunfire at Gornji Vakuf, in central Bosnia, 
between the Bosnian Army and the HVO. 
  Serb forces stepped up their bombing of Sarajevo on 
Wednesday, wounding eight civilians, Lieutenant-Colonel van 
Biesebroeck added. 
  He said 350 shells hit the Bosnian capital. Of these, 60 
percent were aimed at Bosnian positions on Mount Zuc, 30 percent 
at the southwestern districts of Dobrinja and Mojmilo and 10 
percent at the centre of town.

<F P=106> [Christopher Bellamy report: "New Bosnia Chief Takes </F>
`Muscular' Approach"] 
  [Text] Kiseljak -- The new British commander of United 
Nations forces in Bosnia expects them to adopt a more "muscular" 
approach, according to sources at UN headquarters in Kiseljak. 
His view mirrors that of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' 
chief, Larry Hollingworth, that it is time to "get on or get 
out", and interprets the existing UN mandate more widely than 
some. 
  Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose, 53, a former commander 
of the SAS [Special Air Services], arrived at Kiseljak 
yesterday. Asked if he would take a tougher stance than his 
predecessor, Lieutenant-General Francis Briquemont, he said: "I 
can't predict. Our mission is to facilitate the delivery of 
humanitarian aid, to secure the safe areas and to bring about 
peace in this country. I'm going to go around for the first 
week or two looking at how we're going to achieve this." 
  But sources said he would expect his battalions--including 
his old regiment, the Coldstream Guards at Vitez--to operate 
more robustly, and to impose themselves on the countryside. 
Galvanising troops of several nations to take a more active, 
peace-keeping approach will be a great challenge, although the 
French and British governments appear to be in step on a more 
forthright approach. 
  General Rose has said he believes the UN mandate goes far 
enough and that he has enough troops to fulfil it. In his view, 
the mandate provides for securing safe areas, ending the siege 
of Sarajevo and restoring peace -- a wider interpretation than 
some. "My own view is that people's attitudes count more than 
anything else in this country," the general said. 
  He would not be drawn on the question of a possible 
withdrawal. "We are keeping thousands of people alive. If there 
had never been the UN Protection Force there would have been 
wholesale famine and death." He added: "Obviously no 
commitment we have is going to be open ended. There will come a 
time when the countries will look at whether the cost in 
financial terms and human terms justifies the result. Of course 
we can't stay here forever." 
  As General Rose was speaking, news had broken of Bosnian 
army 
successes in attempting to break out of the Maglaj pocket to the 
south-east, with the reported recapture of Donji Mravici and 
Lijesnica. Far to the south, in the British area, there was a 
report of the hamlet of Here, on the main, British-controlled 
supply route, being razed to the ground, Here had been about 
1km inside Bosnian army lines and near the Croat-held town of 
Prozor. 
  A UN military spokesman, Lieutenant-Colonel Bill Aikman, 
also 
said yesterday that a "significant battle" erupted after Croat 
units surged out of Prozor towards government-held Jablanica on 
Monday. 
  General Rose denied that General Briquemont had left Bosnia 
a 
frustrated and broken man. "A lot of nonsense has been talked 
about General Briquemont," he said. 
  France yesterday proposed General Bertrand de Lapresle, 
commander of its Rapid Intervention Force, to take over as 
overall commander of the UN peace-keeping forces in former 
Yugoslavia. 
  The French Defence Minister, Francois Leotard, said he 
wanted 
General de Lapresle to replace General Jean Cot, who is to leave 
at the end of March after clashing pubicly with UN 
Secretary-General, Butrus Butrus-Ghali.

  [Text] Sofia, January 23 (BTA) -- "If all of Macedonia's 
neighbours categorically recognize its territorial integrity, 
and if Macedonia does the same about all its neighbours, the 
region will have a firm security guarantee," Bulgarian Foreign 
Minister Stanislav Daskalov said in an interview in the Nedelya 
150 programme on national radio this morning. 
  By its actions, Bulgaria shows clearly it is in favour of 
friendly relations with Macedonia, Mr. Daskalov said, commenting 
on a statement this week by Greek Minister for European Union 
Affairs Theodhoros Pangalos that "the borders of Albania, 
Bulgaria and Serbia with Macedonia are not safe." 
Bulgarian-Macedonian economic contacts are on the fast track, 
Mr. Daskalov also said. Recalling that the presidents of the 
two countries have met twice and that Prime Minister Lyuben 
Berov has visited Skopje, Mr. Daskalov said "political dialogue 
is on a satisfactory level." 
  Asked about Bulgaria's foreign policy priorities in 1993, 
Mr. 
Daskalov said they were prompted by its main objectives, "to 
create conditions guaranteeing Bulgaria's national security and 
economic development." He listed last year's priorities as 
follows: Integration into the European and Euro-Atlantic 
structures, the Balkan scene and relations with the Balkan 
countries, relations with the United States and Russia, the 
Yugoembargo which, in his view, has inflicted serious damage on 
Bulgaria.

  [Text] Sofia, January 26 (BTA) -- The passage of the 
national budget act within the time limit asked by the prime 
minister, the new conditions in the political space following 
the recent meeting between Zhan Videnov, leader of the 
ex-communist Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), and Filip 
Dimitrov, leader of the anti-communist Union of Democratic 
Forces (SDS), and the rampant crime topped the agenda of a more 
than two-hour-long conversation today between President Zhelyu 
Zhelev and the leader of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights 
and Freedoms (DPS) Ahmed Dogan. Mr. Dogan was late for his 
appointment after talks at the Council of Ministers. The 
government still has room for manoeuvre and may do a lot more, 
the DPS leader said after the meeting. The incumbent cabinet 
was voted into office on the DPS mandate. February 16 is a 
realistic deadline for the passage of the budget, according to 
Mr. Dogan. 
  The bipolar model manifests a perpetuation syndrome which is 
dangerous for the country, said the leader of the third largest 
parliamentary party. As a democratic alternative, centrism may 
offer completely different survival strategies to the country, 
he emphasized. Mr. Dogan reiterated to the president his view 
that the BSP and the SDS have a lot of shared interests and that 
this is all the more obvious after their leaders' meeting. 
"Extremes attract each other because they are similar," he 
said. The anti-presidential campaign and nationalism as a 
powerful trump in the hands of the parliamentary BSP and SDS, 
similar views on the pre-election functioning of parliament and 
on barring the access of other political forces to a future 
parliament constitute a dangerous tendency, according to Mr. 
Dogan. "I would like to state in full responsibility that any 
calling into question the 4 percent threshold (the proportion of 
the vote which, under the effective electoral law, a party 
should poll in order to qualify for the distribution of seats in 
the legislature) may result in such a mess that we will wonder 
whether we are in the Balkans, in Europe or somewhere else in 
the world," he warned. 
  "The new crime situation necessitates more radical 
countermeasures because the incident in Belite Brezi (a Sofia 
neighbourhood where two Red Beret commandos were shot and killed 
by fellow policemen in an unauthorized operation) calls into 
question the competence of the Interior Ministry," Mr. Dogan 
said, summing up his views on the other item on the agenda of 
his talk with the president. In addition to personnel changes 
in the ministry, it needs a new strategy to handle the problems, 
he said. One of the basic things is to guarantee decent living 
and safety to the rank- and-file policemen, the DPS leader 
stressed. "A minister who should excel at firmness and a 
strategy for resolute action rather than at his own virtues is 
another essential condition for the Interior Ministry to do its 
job," the DPS leader emphasized. He rejected the SDS draft 
resolution on personnel changes in the Interior Ministry, 
arguing that an opposition force cannot dictate personnel 
changes in the ministry.

<F P=106> [From BTA's 26 January "Press Review"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Sofia, January 26 (BTA) -- Yesterday's address 
by Prime Minister Lyuben Berov for a speedier passage of the 
1994 national budget is the main story in today's press. 
According to STANDART NEWS, the prime minister predicted early 
elections. A comment in STANDART NEWS says the prime minister 
played a risky game. "The prime minister forebodes a national 
tragedy if the budget fails to pass by mid-February," says 
KONTINENT. "The ball is now with the Bulgarian Socialist Party 
(BSP, the former Communists) who command a majority in 
parliament and determine the cabinet's fate," says the paper. 
According to OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK, the unrealistic deadline for 
passing the budget is most likely a prime minister move seeking 
to leave government losing as less respect as possible. The 
socialist DUMA says the BSP will make a political decision on 
the budget at a special plenum. A comment in the paper says the 
prime minister's statement sounded like an ultimatum and the 
political forces made it clear this was not a constructive tone. 
"This, however, does not mean the nation is approaching 
elections, as in that case it may end the year without a 
budget," says DUMA. The daily of the Union of Democratic Forces 
(SDS) DEMOKRATSIYA emphasizes Berov called the Socialists 
traitors. "BSP declined to consider the financial programme of 
its own government," says the daily. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sofia, January 24 (BTA) -- At its regular meeting 
today, the Council of Ministers adopted two decrees related to 
the fulfillment in 1994 of the obligations which Bulgaria 
assumed under its free trade agreement with the member countries 
of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and its interim 
trade agreement with the European Union (EU). The adoption of 
these decrees expressly introduces into Bulgaria's domestic 
legislation the obligation to abolish and reduce customs duties 
on certain imports from countries of the two groups. The two 
decrees repeat the clauses in the agreement concerning EFTA and 
EU imports to Bulgaria. The accord with EFTA entered into force 
on July 1, 1993, and the agreement with the EU took effect on 
December 31, 1993. The decrees merely reflect the actual state 
of affairs, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Trade Valentin 
Karabashev told reporters. 
  The decrees adopted today abolish import duties and import 
taxes on crude oil, oils and natural gas, meat for human 
consumption, fish products and canned fish, vegetable oils, 
electricity, ores, chemicals, refractory clay, pharmaceuticals, 
super phosphate fertilizer and rough timber, newspapers, 
dictionaries and books originating from EFTA or EU countries. 
Newsprint, however, will not be exempt from customs duty. 
Import duties on certain foods subject to import quotas under 
the agreements, including citrus fruit, coffee, large cattle, 
poultry and dairy products, are reduced under the decrees. 
  The customs concessions are effective as from January 1, 
1994. The two decrees will be updated annually in compliance 
with the further liberalization moves provided by the agreements 
with EFTA and the EU.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 25 (CTK) -- The process of 
transformation which the Polish Army is currently undergoing is 
very similar to that of the Czech Army, Czech President Vaclav 
Havel said at a meeting with Polish Defense Minister Piotr 
Kolodziejczyk today. The meeting was also attended by Czech 
Defense Minister Antonin Baudys, President's Office Head Lubos 
Dobrovsky told journalists. 
  Havel and Kolodziejczyk agreed that the approach of the 
Czech 
Republic and Poland towards the U.S. Partnership for Peace plan 
was very close and in many points fully identical, he said. 
Havel spoke in favor of continuing consultations and 
cooperation in those fields where they could speed up the 
modernization of armaments systems in the cheapest way. 
  Baudys described Kolodziejczyk's visit as the beginning of a 
broad cooperation between the two countries' armies and defense 
ministries and as the starting point of realizing the necessity 
of a dynamic approach towards the Partnership for Peace project. 
  Kolodziejczyk said NATO standards should be introduced in 
both armies as soon as possible and that they should jointly 
proceed towards a secure Europe. He invited Baudys to visit 
Poland. Kolodziejczyk, who is leaving for home today, was in 
the Czech Republic at Baudys's invitation.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 26 (CTK) -- All exercises undertaken by 
the Czech Army within the framework of NATO will be subject to 
the consent of the Czech Parliament, Defense Minister Antonin 
Baudys said today. 
  Article 43 of the Czech Constitution allows for armed forces 
to be sent onto territories outside the Czech Republic only with 
the consent of both houses of parliament. Article 39 provides 
for foreign troops to be stationed in the Czech Republic on 
condition that an absolute majority of members of the Senate 
agree. 
  Speaking on a television discussion program this evening, 
Baudys stated that the Partnership for Peace plan has both a 
political and military layer. States seeking to join needed to 
fulfill certain criteria, he said, such as the transparency of 
military budget and plans, democratic control over the armed 
forces and their ability to take part in UN actions, be they 
humanitarian or protective. 
  He said Partnership for Peace represented a phase in which 
applicant countries should demonstrate their mental, military, 
and above all political compatibility with NATO's existing 
members. 
  Baudys estimated the cost of implementing the project this 
year at only a few hundred million korunas. The plan envisaged 
both joint operations and the dispatch of army specialists to 
Brussels, he said.

registered in the Czech Republic at the end of 1993 reached 
185,000, which represented 3.5 percent unemployment rate, 
according to a Czech Statistical Office (CSU) report made on the 
basis of data from the Czech Ministry of Labor and Social 
Affairs. 
  The number of unemployed reached its peak in December. It 
was falling at the beginning of the year (from 158,000 in 
January to 136,000 in May) and then increasing again. 
  There were 53,938 available jobs in December which was the 
lowest number for the entire last year. It means there were 3.4 
applicants for each vacancy. 
  The highest unemployment rate was in north Moravia (6.2 
percent) and north Bohemia (4.2 percent). 
  As for districts, the north Moravian Bruntal was the most 
affected (8.7 percent), followed by Znojmo, south Moravia, with 
8.5 percent. The lowest unemployment rate was in Prague (0.3 
percent) and west Bohemia (2.6 percent).

  [Text] Budapest, 25 January (MTI) -- In the wake of 
Hungarian-Slovak disputes in recent weeks, Hungarian Foreign 
Minister Geza Jeszenszky wrote to his Slovak counterpart Jozef 
Moravcik today, foreign affairs spokesman Janos Herman told a 
press conference. 
  In a letter, Jeszenszky expresses surprise at the Slovak 
Foreign Ministry and Moravcik personally criticizing an 
interview he gave Polish weekly POLYTIKA. In the interview, 
Jeszenszky said some of Hungary's neighbours had failed to 
totally observe recommendations in the Copenhagen declaration 
and in Council of Europe (CE) papers. 
  These documents guarantee national minorities' individual 
and 
collective rights to set up their own educational, cultural, and 
church institutions, and to play an active role in public 
affairs, including forming local or autonomous administrative 
districts. 
  Under Council of Europe recommendations, all members of an 
ethnic community have the right to use their family and given 
names in their mother tongue, and that right has to be 
recognized by the authorities. In districts with large 
minorities, these communities have the right to use their mother 
tongue in public administration and courts, and put up signs and 
other information in their mother tongue. 
  Hungary's foreign minister found it difficult to say that 
official Slovak practice follows European Union [EU] ethnic 
minority guidelines. South Slovak representatives in a recent 
Komarno conference urged new types of councils following 
"regional traditions," and with more local involvement. 
  Jeszenszky feels Slovakia would help its own interests by 
fulfilling legitimate wishes of Hungarians in Slovakia: Helping 
stability and improving Hungarian-Slovak links, enabling both 
countries to take a common Central European position abroad. 
  The foreign minister saw common interest in reuniting 
citizens by reopening border posts closed since the Second World 
War. 
  "Hungary, as Jozef Moravcik well knows, is ready to confirm 
the well-known fact that it recognizes the two countries' joint 
border," Jeszenszky wrote, saying numerous other unsolved 
problems were holding up the basic agreement, not any border 
question. 
  Herman added that Hungary has Maastricht-like borders in 
mind, saying there was no border dispute. The Hungarian foreign 
minister's visit to Slovakia is still on the agenda, he said.

  [Text] Budapest, 21 Jan (MTI) -- The National Security 
Office today asked MTI to publicize the following statement 
regarding the operation of the World National Popular Rule Party: 
  "The National Security Office of the Republic of Hungary 
lodged an impeachment with the National Police Headquarters 
against Albert Szabo, a dual Hungarian-Australian citizen 
heading the World National Popular Rule Party, and A.B., a 
juvenile activist of the party, on January 21, 1994. They are 
suspected of having committed the crime of incitement against a 
community which is punishable by Par. 269 (1) of the Penal Code." 
  The impeachment followed a Tuesday rally, at which the 
party, 
registered with the Budapest Metropolitan Court in October 1993, 
defined itself as successor to the Hungarian fascist Arrow Cross 
party and its leader, Ferenc Szalasi, who was executed in 1946 
for crimes against humanity. The participants in the rally 
denied that the holocaust had ever taken place. 
  As reported earlier, in Thursday's NEPSZABADSAG, government 
spokeswoman Judit Juhasz said that the Tuesday rally had 
violated constitutional order. She added that the government 
found the activity of the party unacceptable.

  [Text] Budapest, 27 January (MTI) -- Secret Service Chief 
Minister Without Portfolio Tibor Fuzessy sent a letter to Chief 
Public Prosecutor Kalman Gyorgyi, asking him to contact the 
court for the dissolution of the Party of Hungarian Socialist 
Workers [magyar Szocialist Munkasok Partja, MSZMP] and the World 
National Popular Rule Party (VNP), the daily NEPSZABADSAG 
reported on Thursday [27 January]. 
  The MSZMP split from the former state party, the Hungarian 
Socialist Workers' Party, when it changed its name to Workers 
Party at the proposal of Chairman Gyula Thurmer. The 
extreme-left MSZMP commemorated the anniversary of the Russian 
revolution on November 7, 1993. At the celebration, which was 
broadcast on television, five-pointed red stars were displayed 
in contravention of the law banning the use of extremist 
symbols, the letter says, adding that the party defines the 1956 
Hungarian revolution a "counter-revolution." 
  Concerning investigations into the activity of the VNP, 
Fuzessy does not exclude the possibility, according to 
NEPSZABADSAG, that the party will undertake preparations to 
seize power by force, and that its activity will be found to 
amount to instigation against the community. 
  Fuzessy confirmed the information as basically correct in an 
interview by the newspaper. Under the 1989 Association Law, the 
Prosecutor's Office can initiate court proceedings against 
law-breaking political parties. A party may be dissolved if it 
commits or incites a crime, or violates the rights of others. 
  Independent experts estimate VNP membership as barely more 
than 100.

  [Text] Budapest, 26 January (MTI) -- The report of a joint 
Polish-Hungarian-Czech military exercise to be held within the 
framework of Peace Partnership, probably originates from a 
misunderstanding, Lieutenant-Colonel Lajos Erdelyi, spokesman 
for the Ministry of Defence, said on Wednesday [26 January]. 
  MTI's Warsaw correspondent yesterday reported that Polish 
Minister of Defence Piotr Kolodziejczyk, returning from a visit 
to Prague, said on Tuesday evening [25 January] that a military 
exercise of this kind, the largest held within the Peace 
Partnership framework, would be held shortly. 
  Erdelyi said military exercises would definitely be held 
within the Peace Partnership, but no concrete preparations have 
been made so far. NATO member states would also participate, as 
one of the goals is to coordinate with the western military 
forces.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 25 -- President of the Slovak Republic 
Michal Kovac on Tuesday afternoon received Prime Minister 
Waldemar Pawlak. "We have discussed economic issues and the 
results of these talks are very significant," Michal Kovac told 
reporters after the meeting. "We have agreed that Prime 
Minister Pawlak would come to Bratislava and that our 
governments will meet in their full composition," Kovac said. 
  During the "Visegrad group summit" in Prague Waldemar Pawlak 
and Prime Minister Vaclav Meciar agreed that prior to a meeting 
of both cabinets, economic ministers of both countries will meet 
to assess the progress in preparation of agreements between both 
republics. 
  Commenting upon the decision to postpone the signing of 
agreements between Poland and Slovakia, the prime minister said 
that "it is worth to devote more time to these agreements to 
prepare them better." 
  Pawlak stressed that it would be good for the cooperation 
between Poland and Slovakia to be more concrete. "The problem 
boils down not to documents and agreements but above all to 
direct contacts of many people," the prime minister said.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan 26 (CTK) -- The Polish-Slovak 
agreements concerning the environment and border cooperation 
have not yet been signed because they are not yet ready for 
discussion by the Slovak Government, Slovak President Michal 
Kovac told journalists today. 
  The Slovak Foreign Ministry originally intended that the 
agreements be signed during Kovac's current visit to Poland. 
That they will not be signed represents no change of policy, 
Kovac said. Most of the series of agreements will be signed in 
the first quarter of 1994, Kovac said. He added that a meeting 
of the two countries' cabinets was being prepared. 
  Kovac said that a proposal to completely open the common 
border was spontaneously brought up during his Warsaw talks, 
which he considered an expression of great interest in extending 
Slovak-Polish relations. However, this question is linked to 
readmission agreements, and control of foreign citizens and 
goods must be preserved. The opening of the border should only 
concern citizens of the two countries. 
  Kovac said that it was necessary to analyze the interests of 
the individual countries of the Visegrad Four (the Czech 
Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia) and prepare further steps 
to develop mutual cooperation. There are specific questions, 
such as the Partnership For Peace plan, which cannot be solved 
bilaterally and need a joint line, he said. "When four say the 
same thing separately at various places, it is different from 
their speaking with one voice," Kovac said. However, 
cooperation within the Visegrad Group cannot replace bilateral 
relations, he noted. 
  Kovac also met with President of the Polish National Bank 
Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, who said that the creation of a 
Slovak-Polish bank was not being considered. However, some 
Polish bank could take up the assignment. The bank will be 
chosen by the Polish minister for foreign cooperation, she said.

  [Text] Washington, Jan. 25 -- Summing up his Monday's talks 
in Washington, Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski 
declared that a great change has taken place since his December 
visit to the United States in the approach of American political 
elites to the problem of European security. This change is 
evidenced by a more flexible form given to the "Partnership for 
Peace" programme. 
  During a press conference for Polish journalists on Tuesday 
Minister Olechowski said that his talks with Strobe Talbott 
designated as deputy secretary of state focused on the situation 
in Russia while his meeting with head of the National Security 
Council Anthony Lake centred on the "Partnership for Peace" 
programme which Poland accepted two weeks ago. 
  Olechowski informed the Polish newsmen that at the end of 
this week a NATO mission will leave Brussels for Poland to 
discuss the military, technical and financial details of the 
"Partnership for Peace". 
  Warsaw will be the first central European capital to be 
visited by the mission, the minister stressed. 
  "We have explained (to the American side) that we may not 
have the financial resources to fund our military participation 
in the programme. Therefore, joint excercises and other 
improvement efforts should be an object of common financial 
care," Olechowski said. 
  On the same day, Olechowski met with a representative of the 
National Security Council Jane Walker to discuss the possible 
European regional initiatives that the United States would be 
interested in. He also held talks with leader of the American 
Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations 
(AFL- CIO) Lane Kirkland. 
  On Monday evening, the Polish foreign minister attended a 
dinner given in his honour by the Breton Woods Institute and the 
Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. 
  In a speech delivered on the occasion Olechowski favourably 
assessed the "Partnership for Peace" initiative but stressed 
that Poland considered it to be just the first stage leading to 
NATO membership. 
  "The Partnership for Peace obviously increases our security. 
It opens the North Atlantic alliance to the East which makes 
more realistic our hopes for joining the Western security 
structures," he said. He also stressed that the programme 
imposed a stronger obligation on partner-countries to protect 
democratic societies and their freedoms. 
  Simultaneously, Olechowski pointed out that countries such 
as 
Poland which are determined to enter NATO, should be presented 
with concrete criteria of joining the alliance as well as with a 
timetable of the admission process. 
  Referring to the statements by President Bill Clinton and 
Vice- President Al Gore that the security of the central 
European region is directly important for the security of the 
United States, Olechowski declared: "We expect the United States 
to fulfil this obligation and ensure that Poland and other 
countries of the Visegrad group become actively engaged in the 
partnership for peace which should systematically and quickly 
bring them closer to NATO membership." 
  "The Americans understand the fears of Poland and the 
neighbouring states much better than the Europeans who are self- 
assured but lack a vision, Olechowski also declared. 
  Minister Olechowski also met in Washington on Tuesday with 
two influential members of the U.S. Congress, Congressman Dan 
Rostenkowski and Senator Sam Nunn. 
  Rostenkowski is to present to President Bill Clinton the 
Polish foreign minister's suggestions concerning Poland's 
participation in the "Partnership for Peace." 
  Nunn who heads the Senate Armed Forces Committee promised in 
his conversation with Olechowski to see to it that means for the 
"Partnership for Peace" programme be found in the American 
defence budget.

Poland on Thursday as orginally planned. A spokesman close to 
his Polish host Janusz Bryczkowski confirmed the report to the 
German press agency (DPA) in Warsaw today that Zhirinovskiy will 
not travel to Poland until Sunday. He intends to visit the 
former Auschwitz concentration camp and the scene of the 1914 
battle of Tannenberg (Grunwald) in former east Prussia between 
the Germans and the Russians. So far no Polish politician is 
prepared to meet with Zhirinovskiy.

  [Text] Warsaw, Jan. 26 -- Three Polish citizens are 
currently facing trial in Ukraine on charges of smuggling, and 
one of them has allegedly confessed to working with the Polish 
security services, a well-informed source close to the Polish 
Government told the Polish press agency PAP today. 
  The source suggested that it was most likely that the trial 
of the Poles, which begins next Monday [31 January] in the 
Ukrainian capital Kiev, is intended to act as a counter to the 
trial in Warsaw on spying charges of Ukrainian security service 
officer Anatoliy Lysenko, which started in Warsaw on January 19. 
  Neither the Polish Foreign Ministry, nor the State 
Protection 
Office (UOP), was prepared to confirm a statement on Tuesday [25 
January] from the press bureau of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry 
that Polish-Ukrainian discussions on the Lysenko affair were 
held on January 24.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 25/1/1994 -- In an interview 
granted to the daily CRONICA ROMANA, President Ion Iliescu shows 
his opinions regarding the memorandum concluded between Romania 
and IMF and Romania's participation in the Partnership for Peace 
NATO programme. 
  "The memorandum is not a document imposed on the Romanian 
Government by the IMF. It reflects in fact the government's 
economic principles negotiated and approved by the IMF, for the 
principles in the memorandum are part of the Romanian 
Government's economic reform strategy. That is why I view as 
false the references regarding the fact that the IMF is 
dictating to us, that the memorandum could have had negative 
effects. In fact these are issues specific to the process of 
transition and economic reform in Romania, directly linked to 
the essence of the government's economic policy. The truth is 
that we are facing a difficult situation which implies also 
specific restrictive measures that we are to self-impose on us, 
precisely to relaunch and bring to normality the economic life 
in our country." 
  Related to Romania's participation in the NATO programme of 
Partnership for Peace, President Ion Iliescu stated the 
following: "the taken decision is a solution for which we have 
strived a lot. It was obvious that there were several efforts in 
the past years to impose a discriminatory treatment in the ties 
with the countries in this area... It seems to me that once with 
the American Administration's initiative that has carried into 
effect that partnership, the NATO leadership has answered 
Romania's fundamental concerns regarding non-discriminatory 
elements among the countries in this part of Europe. That is 
why the adopted solution seems to be the most correct one 
corresponding to the current period". 
  Ion Iliescu also showed criticism over certain positions 
expressed in Romania against the country's participation in the 
Partnership for Peace programme. "To follow this line would 
mean nothing else but to give satisfaction precisely to those 
who are seeking to isolate Romania and put our country at threat 
as regards its security and stability".

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 26/1/1994 -- Admitted four 
months ago to the Council of Europe, Romania started its 
activity as full member of the Parliamentary Assembly in 
Strasbourg, where it has 10 votes, on January 24. The head of 
the Romanian delegation, Florin Radulescu-Botica, was elected 
one of the Assembly's vice-presidents on the first day of the 
session. 
  Radulescu-Botica speaks in an interview with the daily 
DREPTATEA about the willingness of the Romanian Parliament 
members to be active in the Council of Europe. He specifies 
that Romania is no exception in being applied Directive 488 (for 
control of the fulfillment of the commitments assumed when it 
was given the status of Council of Europe full member). It 
shares this with other newly received members, such as 
Lithuania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and the 
procedure is going to be used also for the countries to be 
admitted from now on. Radulescu-Botica announced that Mr. 
Koenig, Council of Europe rapporteur for Romania was going to 
arrive in Bucharest at the end of March. The Romanian vice 
president of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly said 
he hoped that Romania would be able to present positive data on 
its efforts at all levels, made in order to meet the commitments 
it made when it entered the European body. 
  During the debates on the situation in former Yugoslavia, 
Romanian parliamentarians in the Council of Europe Assembly 
pointed to the difficulties encountered by Romania in order to 
enforce the embargo imposed to rump Yugoslavia. They opined 
that the sanctions would not trigger a solution of the crisis in 
the area. Deputy Dumitru Buzatu showed on that occasion that 
the figures on Romania's losses in consequence of the 
enforcement of the embargo are higher than those in the report 
presented to the Assembly, they amount not to three but to 
$7,000,000,000. "The sum results from both direct and indirect 
losses in import-export activities and are based on data on the 
evolution of the economic relations between Romania and 
Yugoslavia over 1989-1992," he said. For his part Senator 
Adrian Paunescu opined that a solution has to be sought for the 
crisis in Yugoslavia not by enforcing embargoes and restrictions 
as "this affects nations and not governments." He has 
underlined that no foreign intervention can lead to a viable 
solution, adding that "all foreign interventions, irrespective 
of when and where they are made, have to be understood as civil 
war."

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 26/1/1994 -- The craze of the 
so-called "mutual assistance games" which has spread all over 
Romania has come to a new phase of development. Almost weekly 
newspapers trumpet the crash of one or another of these ventures 
that mushroomed in all the four winds, but it is also newspapers 
that advertise new such games run by "dependable" firms. Naive 
people ignore warnings from the authorities and the over one 
million complaints registered so far with the police, claiming 
return of invested sums, and keep placing their money hoping 
that, for once, they will strike it. But when it all comes to a 
dead end, they suddenly start to panic and revolt at the thought 
that they will not be able to recover at least the money first 
deposited. In some cases game runners return 80 percent of the 
initial deposit, keeping the change for their pockets. In other 
cases the end begins with announcements like "no payments 
today," or "the bank did not have enough cash," or "the boss is 
away for two days," or "operations halted for repairs to 
defective computer." 
  Last Monday in Pitesti, frustration reached such magnitude 
in 
those cheated that the town was on the verge of disaster. 
Several thousands of the 600,000 investors in the various 
"mutuals," seized with rage, marched to the local game houses, 
threatening to devastate and set them ablaze. Their wrath then 
found other targets: the mayor of Pitesti, the prefecture, the 
Agricultural Bank, the financial police. A young man, suspected 
of being the bodyguard of one of the game bosses, was molested 
by the mob. The prompt intervention of the police somehow 
quenched the fury of the crowd stopping it from making more 
victims and causing more damage. However, four such houses had 
been already ravaged. 
  The police announced that one of the bosses of such a 
"mutual 
assistance" circuit, the "Philadelphia," Ioan Negruta, 39 years 
of age, an electrician by profession, was arrested under the 
charges of fraud, embezzlement, and fraudulent bankruptcy, only 
two days after he had given assurances on the local TV network 
that the circuit was all right and going on after having made, 
he said, no less than 25,000 millionaires among Pitesti 
residents and having made payments in the region of 35 billion 
lei. The police detected a 2 billion lei fraud in the firm's 
books. More exactly, the total deposit stands at 25.2 billion 
lei, of which 150 million had been registered as the owner's 
profit and 23 billion as paid to investors.

positively the political tendencies in Ukraine aiming at 
creating a nuclear weapon-free state, the Slovak Foreign 
Ministry said in a statement given to CTK today. Ukraine is the 
Slovakia's only neighbor possessing strategic nuclear weapons. 
  Slovakia considers documents on removing nuclear weapons 
from 
Ukrainian territory signed by Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. President 
Bill Clinton to be an important step on the road towards 
complete nuclear disarmament, the statement said. 
  Under the Moscow agreement, Ukraine is to rid itself of all 
176 nuclear missiles and of almost 1,600 nuclear warheads in 
exchange for aid amounting to one billion U.S. dollars. 
  "We consider this fact proof that even in complicated social 
and economic conditions, it is possible to find compromise 
solutions in the interests of stability and security in Europe. 
Such an approach could serve as example for other states in 
solving other important problems," the statement said. It 
voiced the conviction that all the countries concerned will 
create the conditions necessary for practical realization of the 
documents signed and for fulfilling obligations ensuing from the 
Strategic Arms Treaty (START-1) and the Lisbon protocol.

  [Text] Kosice, eastern Slovakia, Jan 25 (CTK) -- 
Prosecution proceedings have been initiated against the 
editor-in-chief of the east Slovak regional weekly DOMINO EFEKT, 
Andrej Hrico, for defamation of the republic and its 
representatives. 
  The prosecution is founded on the publication of a reader's 
letter last summer which read: "As long as various popularity 
polls are led by a person like Mr. Meciar, with (Party of the 
Democratic Left Chairman Petr) Weiss, (Culture Minister Dusan) 
Slobodnik, (Parliament Chairman Ivan) Gasparovic, Ambassador to 
the Czech Republic Ivan) Mjartan, (Constitutional Court Judge 
Milan) Cic and the Kovacs behind him, things will never be all 
right in Slovakia." 
  Since the word "Kovacs" could be understood as referring to 
Slovak President Michal Kovac, the investigating officer has 
maintained that the author is "publicly defaming the president 
of the Republic." 
  "These people are political cowards, characterless rogues, 
who are doing great damage to Slovakia. It annoys me that 
people cannot tell lies from truth and that they have been duped 
again by sacked comrades," the letter continues. 
  The investigation has so far established that the author was 
writing under an assumed name. Consequently Hrico, as 
editor-in- chief legally obliged to ensure the authenticity and 
check the origin of all the information he publishes, has in 
effect broken the law. 
  Hrico told CTK that he was questioned twice last year 
although the investigation at that stage focused more on the 
sender of the letter. In his view the writer was not 
necessarily referring to the president as he personally could 
think of half a dozen Kovacs who currently figure in Slovak 
politics.

  [Text] Kosice, East Slovakia, Jan 26 (CTK) -- Slovak 
Premier and Chairman of the government coalition Movement For a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), Vladimir Meciar, is trying hard to 
corrupt several parliamentary deputies from the Democratic Left 
Party (SDL), the latest issue of the Slovak weekly DOMINO EFEKT 
quotes SDL Deputy Chairwoman Alzbeta Borzova as saying. 
  "It is clear that the goal of Meciar's efforts is the 
gradual 
split of the Peter Weiss-led SDL into two parts, of which one 
will be finally swallowed by Meciar in the form of the so-called 
functional coalition," the weekly writes. It adds that the 
resistance of SDL deputies so far probably results from the 
disturbing example of the Slovak National Party (SNS) the HZDS's 
coalition partner now facing a split due to similar reasons. 
  However, Meciar believes that everybody can be bought, its 
only the price what matters, the paper writes. That is why 
Meciar's offers have been still higher and have been repeated 
with "incredible persistence." The SDL leadership is aware that 
if Meciar gains more economic power, he would finally destroy 
their party. "Forty-eight HZDS deputies of the total of 66 run 
their own businesses, and Meciar has promised them that they 
will also privatize in a short time," DOMINO EFEKT quotes 
Borzova as saying. "Therefore it is politically unbearable for 
the SDL that the posts of privatization minister and chairman of 
the National Property Fund continue to be held by the Premier," 
the paper states. If the government draft amendment to the 
large privatization law is passed at the current parliamentary 
session, the opposition could definitively "give up everything," 
it adds. 
  The weekly notes that Meciar has asked Defense Minister 
Imrich Andrejcak to appoint him general. "Fortunately this is 
not aimed at gaining further powers, but making an impression," 
DOMINO EFEKT comments, adding that the appointment is to take 
place within two months.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 26 (CTK) -- An article in the 
independent daily SME looks at letters sent by various Czech 
ministries in reply to a petition by the Association of Czechs 
in Slovakia (SCS), and comments that most of the SCS's demands 
are unrealistic. The SCS petition was adopted at the SCS 
constituent meeting held on December 4, 1993. 
  The Czech Interior Ministry replied that Czech law does not 
allow dual citizenship and that it does not stand a chance of 
being amended in the foreseeable future. Making an exemption 
for older people would create an unwelcome precedent, the 
ministry says. 
  The Czech Ministry for State Property Administration and 
Privatization replied that those Czechs who are permanently 
resident in Slovakia are not allowed to take part in voucher 
privatization, but they can purchase privatized property if they 
wish so. 
  A demand for Czech culture centers in places with large 
Czech 
minorities will have to be postponed until after the launching 
of the Bratislava center, and this will only open when a 
suitable space to house it is found, the Czech Culture Ministry 
replied. Other centers will open in Kosice and Presov, both 
east Slovakia, and Zilina, central Slovakia. 
  The government Radio and Television Council says that the 
use 
of long-wave radio broadcasting, heard across Slovakia, will 
continue to be granted. As for Czech TV, the Council is 
considering a license for satellite broadcasting as ground-based 
TV stations do not reach Slovakia. 
  The Czech Health Ministry, citing the law, says that Czech 
Slovaks are not eligible for Czech health insurance. 
  The Transport Ministry says that reduced railway fees for 
old-age pensioners cannot be extended to another state's 
citizens as no reciprocal agreement has been signed with 
Slovakia, and as for reduced urban transport fees, this lies 
within the competence of local government. 
  The Czech Education Ministry says, however, that Czechs 
wishing to study in the Czech Republic are exempt from school 
fees, SME writes.

  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 25 (CTK) -- Representatives of the 
coalition Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH) and 
Egyutteles turned to the Council of Europe (CE) with a complaint 
about insufficient guarantees for the rights of the ethnic 
minorities in Slovakia, Pal Csaky, a deputy for the MKDH, told 
journalists today. 
  The letter to the CE says that Slovakia is not observing its 
commitments towards the CE regarding ethnic policy, Csaky 
reported. 
  This statement is exemplified by the shortcomings in the 
adopted laws on names and surnames, anomalies in the names of 
Hungarians communities in south Slovakia and the discriminatory 
language law, Csaky said. 
  The so-called alternative educational system, which assumes 
that vocational subjects should be taught in Slovak, is a 
"well-thought out attack on the system of the Hungarian 
schools," Csaky stated. 
  Chairman of the opposition Democratic Left Party (SDL) Peter 
Weiss said that the demands voiced in Komarno (during a meeting 
of ethnic Hungarian representatives on January 8) are 
"exaggerated and tactlessly articulated." They served the 
governing coalition because they deflected public attention from 
the growing economic and social problems, "created the picture 
of an enemy, and pushed the poorly working process of 
privatization to the margin of interest. [no closing quotation

  [Excerpt] Bratislava, Jan 26 (CTK) -- [passage omitted] 
The daily REPUBLIKA, published by the state-run Slovak News 
Agency TA SR, describes the policies of Budapest towards ethnic 
minorities and complaints by Hungarian ethnic minority 
representatives in Slovakia concerning their position as 
hypocritical. 
  The daily notes that according to official data, of 
Hungary's 
population of 10 million in 1991, 92 percent were Hungarians, 
three percent Romanies, and one percent each Germans, Slovaks, 
Jews, south Slavs, and others. However, according to the same 
official data, 98 percent of the Hungarian population speak 
Hungarian while only two percent speak other languages. The 
daily also points to the contradiction between Hungary's Law on 
Ethnic Minorities, under which they have the right to be 
represented in Parliament, and the election law in which such a 
right is not embedded. 
  "This testifies to the fact that through the Law on Ethnic 
Minorities Hungary just wants to deceive the world, while the 
practice is quite different. A similar situation is also with 
ethnic minorities and the number of its members. On one hand 
Budapest allegedly recognized the existence of minorities but on 
the other it actually rejects their existence, because almost 
every Hungarian citizen speaks Hungarian. And weighing all pros 
and cons, citizens are right in the long run because the 
assimilation of non- Hungarians in Hungary is tough and 
pitiless. To round up all the facts we will receive a gross 
bundle of hypocrisy in front of the whole world, Europe, and 
especially of neighbors," the daily writes. 
  We can say without exaggeration that in Slovakia the 
Hungarian minority enjoys super-rights. In spite of this many 
of them maintain that they are being deprived of their basic 
rights. It is possible to live with hypocrisy and to deceive 
many for some time. But if hypocrisy acquires a double dimension 
-- that Slovaks and other minorities enjoy all rights in Hungary 
and the Hungarian minority in Slovakia is deprived of all rights 
-- it is necessary to speak about pathological abnormality, a 
disease which should be dealt with in order for it not to 
paralyze the whole European region as it has already done, for 
example, in the Balkans, REPUBLIKA concludes. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Bratislava, Jan 26 (CTK) -- [passage omitted] 
The independent NARODNA OBRODA turns its attention to the 
forthcoming discussion in the Slovak Parliament today of the 
government and opposition amendments to the Law on Large 
Privatization. Given the current distribution of forces in 
Parliament, every vote will count in whether the government bill 
or that of the opposition is approved, the daily writes. The 
opposition think that by pushing its bill through parliament, 
the government seeks to gain a decisive influence over the 
privatization process, which will basically define not only 
economic but also power developments in Slovakia for years to 
come. 
  The daily SME, referring to the same topic, writes that the 
result of the vote will determine whether Slovak Premier 
Vladimir Meciar will have everything or only almost everything. 
If he succeeded in getting his triple office -- the premier, 
privatization minister, and president of National Property Fund 
(FNM) -- endorsed by the supreme legislature then nothing would 
remain for the opposition than, in the words of Frantisek 
Miklosko (chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) 
deputies' group) to watch. Following the implemented purges in 
the state administration bodies and the breakup of the deputies' 
group of the government coalition Slovak National Party (SNS), 
Meciar will now only have to get an upper hand over 
privatization which, given the prevailing methods of the 
"division" of state property, offers boundless possibilities for 
producing new owners of small shops who would be appreciated for 
their staunch positions and who would be always reliable as far 
as voting is concerned." 
  Although opposition deputies realize this, the question is 
whether they will be able to prevent this trend. The premier is 
also very well aware of what is at stake in this game and what 
the current distribution of forces looks like. The fact that 
the amended bill on investment funds, which met opposition from 
domestic and foreign businessmen, was withdrawn from the agenda 
of the current parliamentary session also testified to this. 
  "And yet it could not be ruled out that several mini chess 
games will be played in connection with the bill on large 
privatization, because it is more advantageous for the premier 
to preserve the status quo than to risk the separation of the 
functions of FNM president and privatization minister, which 
could happen under a certain constellation of deputies' votes," 
the daily writes. 
  SLOVENSKY DENNIK, close to the opposition KDH, writes that 
"the opposition was thus far able to just point to the 
accumulation of functions and power." The daily voices the view 
that this state of affairs will remain unchanged. It is likely 
that Parliament will not be able, during the vote on the Bill on 
Large Privatization, to approve the separation of the office of 
privatization minister from the functions of FNM chairman, and 
the functions of the finance minister from the functions of 
chairman of FNM Supervisory Council. 
  The independent daily SME carries an interview with Mikulas 
Dzurinda, deputy chairman of the opposition Christian Democratic 
Movement (KDH), on the same topic. "It is high time that not 
only the opposition deputies' clubs realized the danger that the 
concentration of economic power in the hands of one movement or 
one person poses, not only for the development of the economy, 
but also for democracy in Slovakia," Dzurinda says in connection 
with the upcoming parliamentary session, at which government and 
opposition amendments to the Law on Large Privatization are to 
be discussed. 
  Approval of the government amendment, Dzurinda says, "would 
mean that the premier will be able to influence changes to and 
interference in privatization projects, even approved ones, even 
more." 
  Dzurinda also expresses fear that Meciar tactically did not 
decide to remove the large privatization amendment from the 
parliamentary agenda. "It is now clear to everyone that the 
premier is concentrating his power, and that through the 
concentration of economic power wants to increase his own 
political power. Even the smallest suspicion that this power 
could be weakened could lead him to remove the amendment on 
large privatization from the agenda. And this would be very 
bad," he says. 
  In an interview with SLOVENSKY DENNIK, Peter Weiss, chairman 
of the Democratic Left Party (SDL), also expresses disagreement 
with the government amendment to the law on large privatization. 
"I believe that opposition deputies and at least some from the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) are aware of the risk 
of approving such a proposal," he says. 
  "We wanted to and continue to want to prevent the further 
concentration of power and the division of privatization for 
political reasons. The government did not accept this and 
decided to create a faithful structure of owners, because it 
will depend on the deputies of the governing movement what 
position it takes on this tendency. The opposition parties are 
united in the view that it is necessary to prevent the 
continuation of the personal union between the Privatization 
Ministry and the FNM," Weiss says. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tirana, January 21 (ATA) -- There is ethnic 
discrimination in every area of social and political life in the 
former Republic of Macedonia, reports the Committee for the 
Protection of Human Rights and Freedoms, "Helsinki Watch." The 
Helsinki report refutes the claims of the Macedonian authorities 
that the government's policies have resulted in improving 
relations between the different nationalities in the country. 
The report declares that the policies of the present Government 
of Macedonia to promote better relations among different 
nationalities is essentially the same as those of the previous 
governments of the country. 
  The present government, in fact, has done nothing to improve 
the position of the Albanians, who make up 40 percent of the 
population, according to a statement by the Democratic Popular 
Party with headquarters in Tetove. Observers agree that the 
future of Macedonia will depend on harmonious relations between 
the Albanian and the Slav Macedonian populations. One of the 
most important requests of the ethnic Albanians is for a census, 
which has been the subject of a heated debate in the Macedonian 
parliament. 
  The Albanian deputies have supported the request of the 
European census commission experts, that all nationalities in 
the republic be represented on the national and communal 
commissions which will carry out the census.

  [Text] At a news conference today, Navy Commander Vice 
Admiral Ventseslav Velkov declared that 80 percent of the 57 
fighting ships and 37 auxiliary vessels and launches in the 
Bulgarian Navy are obsolete. The navy is at the limit of its 
combat readiness, he said, and our sailors may not manage to 
hold out unless finances are allocated in the Navy budget to 
overcome the problems. 
  [Begin Velkov recording] Most Bulgarians, for one reason or 
another, use the sea only for recreation, and they do not see 
the big problems that face Bulgaria as a naval power. [end 
recording] 
  It is very expensive to maintain the old vessels, but no 
money is available to buy new ones. The submarines have had 
their armaments removed, but to acquire a new one someone will 
have to cough up about $170 million. A fighting frigate is too 
expensive for us; one costs 350 million German marks. At the 
moment there is not enough money even for repairs.

  [Text] Major Rusi Gochev, chairman of the Bulgarian 
Rakovski Officers Legion, has sent a letter to Dr. Zhelyu Zhelev 
and to Minister of Defense Valentin Aleksandrov, which reads as 
follows: 
  "On 7 January 1994 the daily TRUD published a report under 
the headline: `Presidential Advisers Reach for the Army' in 
which our organization is mentioned among other things. 
  "After thorough investigations and numerous interviews, we 
officially declare that neither our leadership nor individual 
member-clubs of the Legion have ever commented on the 
president's letter to the commanders of the Armed Forces' 
branches, or on the relations between the president's Military 
Office and the Army's General Staff. 
  "We are convinced that the aforementioned report has cited 
the Legion in a deliberately distorted fashion, prompted by 
evidently biased political intentions. 
  "Similar `operations' are likely to provoke tension among 
our 
members. They are contributing to a politicization of the 
soldiers' life which is counterproductive to the consolidation 
of the Bulgarian Army's fighting ability."

<F P=106> [BULGARSKA ARMIYA staff report: "Army Once Again Enjoys </F>
Highest Confidence"] 
  [Text] According to a poll conducted this month by 
BBSS-Gallup International, 69 percent of the respondents have 
confidence in the Bulgarian Army. The result indicates a 
traditionally high level of popularity, one that cannot be 
achieved by other institutions or any individual in Bulgaria! 
  The president, who enjoys the confidence of 49 percent of 
the 
respondents, continues to lead the list of politicians, followed 
by Aleksandur Tomov, Georgi Pirinski, and Lyuben Berov. The 
police maintain the popularity figure of 43 percent that they 
reached at the end of last year. Of those polled, 27 percent 
have faith in the government, while parliament's rating 
continues to be low -- only 12 percent. Despite this, more than 
half of the 19 most popular politicians are National Assembly 
deputies.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Peto, chairman of the Alliance of Free </F>
Democrats, by Szabolcs Szereto; place and date not given: "We 
Should Not Limit the Coalition Possibilities"] 
  [Text] [Szereto] You said recently that the next 
government would start its activity under more difficult 
conditions than the Antall cabinet did in 1990. Prime Minister 
Peter Boross also reacted to your statement in a television 
interview. Would you give us some details about your statement? 
  [Peto] I would like to point out that I formulated my 
statement as an assessment of the situation, and not as a value 
judgment. I did not deal with the question of who was 
responsible for the situation and to what extent. Statistical 
data, analyses made by independent experts, and my experience 
accumulated during my various visits all over the country prove 
that Hungary's mood and economic situation are worse now. It is 
a fact that national income has decreased considerably, the 
agricultural sector has lost its former role of economic 
stabilizer, unemployment has become a massive problem, and 
insecurity has generally increased. I think that one of the 
greatest mistakes of this government was that it did not 
evaluate Hungary's situation when it came to power. It also 
belongs to the general picture that many people were not aware 
of the realities. In formulating its election program, the 
Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] started from the real 
situation prevailing in Hungary, because this is the only 
realistic starting point. This is particularly important in the 
case of a party that has a good chance of participating in the 
next government. 
  [Szereto] What will the SZDSZ deputies' meeting that starts 
tomorrow deal with? 
  [Peto] It will be the task of group meetings to finalize the 
detailed program. While this will actually be a professional 
workshop activity, at the plenary meeting where Gabor Kuncze and 
I will give speeches we want to formulate our ideas to the 
broadest public possible. We would like to present a 
comprehensive picture about the SZDSZ to the broadest public 
possible. Ever since we elected Gabor Kuncze as our nominee for 
the position of prime minister, a special division of labor has 
emerged between us. According to this, Gabor Kuncze speaks 
mainly about parliamentary and government affairs, program 
formulation, and economic issues to be placed in the center of 
our election campaign. As the chairman of the party, I will 
speak mainly about the general political situation, including 
the situation of the SZDSZ. 
  [Szereto] Under your leadership, the SZDSZ emerged as a 
uniform and organized party in the eyes of the public, and the 
arrival of the former members of the Federation of Young 
Democrats [FIDESZ] will obviously strengthen your position. 
However, opinion polls show that the SZDSZ does not enjoy the 
same level of support today as it enjoyed in 1990. In view of 
this, what is your opinion about the election prospects of the 
SZDSZ and generally of the liberal bloc? 
  [Peto] Indeed, the SZDSZ is not yet in the position it wants 
to achieve during the elections, but this was the case months 
before the 1990 elections too. Opinion polls are multifaceted 
and we can have an idea about the election prospects of a party 
not only on the basis of primary support, but also on the basis 
of other factors. Some 40 percent of voters would welcome the 
SZDSZ in the next coalition, which is a pretty good percentage. 
Many people predict an SZDSZ victory, and we have strong 
secondary support, and very few people say that they would not 
vote for us in any case. Therefore, the SZDSZ has considerable 
resources and, based on all this, I am sure that we will give 
our supporters a pleasant surprise at the elections. We are 
striving to make sure that the liberal forces show a 
considerable presence in the new parliament, and this is why an 
SZDSZ-FIDESZ agreement was achieved. In harmony with this 
agreement, we are building relations with other liberal parties, 
like the Agrarian Federation and the Party of Entrepreneurs. 
With them, and with the Republic Party, we will nominate joint 
candidates. In my opinion, the liberal forces have good 
election chances and it seems that they will play a decisive 
role in the next parliament. I am also sure that it will be 
impossible to form a coalition without the liberal parties. 
  [Szereto] On the basis of various statements, one can 
conclude that the positions of the two parliamentary liberal 
parties differ somewhat regarding coalition intentions. Your 
political rivals often accuse you of approaching the Hungarian 
Socialist Party [MSZP]. What are your relations with the MSZP 
like, and what kind of coalition ideas do you have? 
  [Peto] It is useless to deny that the SZDSZ and the FIDESZ 
speak differently about coalition possibilities but, in my 
opinion, these differences can be bridged. When the coalition 
talks started, the SZDSZ started from the premise that we must 
preserve all the possibilities of a future coalition. We did 
not want, nor do we want now, to limit our available political 
scope with artificial means, political gestures, or unilateral 
declarations. We regard the statements of the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum [MDF] and Christian Democratic People's Party 
[KDNP] deputies as a fact, namely their slogan of "not with the 
SZDSZ." Indeed, we did not have too many chances of cooperating 
with these parties after the elections. The statements coming 
from the government side, statements that present the FIDESZ as 
a proper party as opposed to the SZDSZ, obviously aim at 
disbanding the liberal alliance. Although the FIDESZ leaders 
made a lot of unfriendly statements about the socialists, they 
did not exclude the possibility of a coalition in principle, and 
the MSZP did not clearly exclude any liberal party from a 
possible coalition either. I would characterize the relations 
between the SZDSZ and the MSZP as a correct coexistence: We do 
not join the so-called anticommunist campaign, we maintain our 
objective criticism of the MSZP policy, and we formulate our 
concerns. While the MSZP focuses on its social sensitivity, in 
my view, this party continues to be largely bound to the elite 
that also profited from the previous regime. The appearance of 
some socialist candidates and others also shows that many 
representatives of the old regime who have been in the 
background so far will become "reactivated" at the next 
elections. This could produce internal tensions within the MSZP, 
because those who played a role in this party so far and were 
active politically in the course of the past four years despite 
all the inconveniences involved will now be able to meet in 
their own party with people against whom they represented the 
concept of reform and democratic transformation. At the same 
time, one can see a contradiction between the written economic 
concepts of the MSZP and the declared goals presented at 
meetings. All this makes it difficult to evaluate the 
socialists' real political intentions. The possible coalition 
talks after the elections will actually show the extent to which 
the actual concepts and political practice of the MSZP are 
compatible with the liberal ideals. I regard the attempt of 
"connecting" the SZDSZ with the MSZP as part of the negative 
campaign. As part of this campaign, rumors have been spread 
lately of secret negotiations between the two parties on 
cooperation in the second round of the elections. There is no 
basis for all this, and it would also be useless, because it 
could happen that the two parties become the most serious rivals 
of each other in the second round.

<F P=106> ["G.J.Z.-L.S."-signed report: "Gyorkos Leads the </F>
`Hungarists' -- The Budapest Leader Gives Interview to our 
Newspaper"] 
  [Text] In addition to the World National Popular Rule 
Party [VNP] -- whose leaders are being investigated by the 
police after being reported by the National Security Office -- 
other registered and illegal organizations also openly adhere to 
the heritage and ideology of the former Arrow Cross men 
[Hungarian Nazis]. It seems that these organizations have 
serious disagreements. This is what we learned from one of the 
activists -- interviewed by our correspondents -- of the 
Hungarian National Front [Magyar Nemzeti Arcvonal, MNA], which 
has already been announced as a movement. Istvan Gyorkos, whose 
Nazi activities were noted by the authorities and who was 
sentenced by the court to suspended imprisonment for incitement 
against the community in 1993, is the "national commander" of 
the MNA. We interviewed the leader of the MNA's youth group in 
Budapest. His name is known to our editorial staff but he 
wished to preserve his anonomity in the interview in which he 
spoke about the extreme right-wing movements in Hungary, their 
connections and operation. 
  On 21 November 1993, Istvan Gyorkos officially announced the 
Hungarian National Front Movement at the court. As they do not 
yet wish to function as a party, they do not need court 
registration for their operation. As opposed to the VNP led by 
Albert Szabo, the MNA considers itself to be the true Hungarist 
[Hungarian Nazi] movement. 
  The Budapest party leader spoke about Gyorkos as the 
successor of former Arrow Cross leader Ferenc Szalasi with legal 
continuity. It is alleged that the former leader of the old 
Arrow Cross Party who was living in Australia instructed Gyorkos 
to organize and lead the new Hungarist movement. The MNA is a 
nationwide organization. As its activist stated, the Hungarist 
movement has regional leaders and it is led by a so-called 
leading core. "We do not have any membership, we only have 
supporters in all large cities of the country. We also have 
influence on a number of social organizations, for example the 
National Guard Federation [Nemzetor Szovetseg], the scout 
troops, and the National Federation of Political Prisoners 
[POFOSZ]," he said. The MNA is mainly supported by the younger 
and older skinheads and it already has a propaganda group. 
  In Hungary, the skinhead group called Szalasi Guard is also 
based on Arrow Cross traditions. Its leader, just as our 
interviewee, was one of the accused in the court case of 
skinheads relating to the incident at Dobrentei square. Our 
interviewee knows them but he distances himself from them 
because, as he says, the Szalasi Guard is too aggressive and 
simple: "All they do is keep drawing arrow crosses on walls." 
  His views on the VNP are even more bleak. He knows Albert 
Szabo, its leader, because after his return from Australia, 
Szabo got in touch with Gyorkos. He is supposed to have been 
instructed by the Australian Arrow Cross membership to help the 
MNA's party building work. However, instead, Szabo started to 
"build his own career on separate ways." Szabo deceives the 
unsuspecting young people, the skinheads. Istvan Gyorkos is 
accepted throughout the world but even the Australian Arrow 
Cross membership has distanced itself from Szabo, our 
interviewee claimed. 
  According to our interviewee, Albert Szabo has often 
received 
cash from the editor of the NAPKELET journal. He also asked for 
financial help from Australia but he was refused. Gyorkos's 
group did not support him financially, although, according to 
the activist, it could have. The MNA receives money from the 
Australian Arrow Cross membership, from its wealthier members. 
In fact, they even have enterprises: They want to publish and 
sell books, bumper stickers, and T-shirts. 
  They also have foreign connections. They know the American 
and West European neo-Nazis. "They think in terms of 
international national socialism, but the MNA first has to 
become strong in Hungary. We no longer distribute the militant 
national socialist bulletin called NEW ORDER which is made in 
the United States," our interviewee said. We also have links 
with extreme right-wingers in Russia, namely with the Pamyat 
radical nationalist organization. 
  According to reports, at the meetings of the VNP, Szabo 
denied the Holocaust and the destruction of Jews in the Second 
World War. The MNA's youth leader also accepts this view and 
treats it as a historic fact. However, he does not deal with 
this issue because "Hungarian issues are more important for the 
MNA."

  [Text] Delegations of the Republic of Croatia and the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] have held a meeting in 
Geneva. The delegations were led by Mate Granic, deputy prime 
minister and foreign minister of the Republic of Croatia, and 
FRY Deputy Prime Minister Zeljko Simic. The meeting was held on 
the basis of the recently signed declaration between the two 
countries. After the talks, which were of a consultative 
character, both sides said that they reached an agreement on 
several matters. This is assessed as a step forward in the 
implementation of the joint declaration. 
  Both sides have taken all necessary steps to ensure that the 
two governments' offices open in Zagreb and Belgrade by the 15 
February deadline and that all related technicalities are agreed 
upon. 
  They also agreed to set up a joint commission of the two 
governments to deal with displaced persons, refugees, and other 
humanitarian issues. The two governments are to appoint 
high-ranking and responsible members of the commission as soon 
as possible and invite ICRC [International Committee of the Red 
Cross] and UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees] 
representatives to take part in the commission's work. The 
commission will be open for contacts with the families of 
missing people and their associations. 
  Both sides took on the responsibility to unconditionally 
exchange information on the missing persons and make extra 
efforts to find them. At the same time the commission will be 
allowed access to all locations presumed to house either 
imprisoned or missing persons. 
  The two sides also examined all other issues of importance 
for the normalization of relations between the two countries and 
for Croatian-Serbian relations as a whole. They agreed to 
examine these issues at regular meetings at high political 
level, in principle once a month, in the capitals Zagreb and 
Belgrade on an alternating basis. 
  To this aim Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and 
foreign minister, invited Deputy Prime Minister Zeljko Simic to 
visit Zagreb. The invitation was accepted with pleasure and the 
date was fixed for 12 February. On this occasion there will 
also be held the first meeting of the joint commission for 
missing persons and humanitarian issues.

  [Text] Geneva, 27 Jan (TANJUG) -- Speaking about the 
meeting with his Croatian colleague Mate Granic, Federal Deputy 
Prime Minister Zeljko Simic told TANJUG that the most important 
thing was that today's meeting with representatives of the 
Croatian Government, which lasted nearly six hours, took place 
in a highly tolerant atmosphere. 
  In Simic's assessment, today's meeting is paving the way 
toward the realization of the joint declaration signed by the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia two weeks ago in 
Geneva. 
  Two exceptionally important proposals were made concrete 
today: To set up a joint commission under the aegis of 
international humanitarian organizations (ICRC [International 
Committee of the Red Cross] and UNHCR). 
  Deputy Prime Minister Simic laid special emphasis on the 
beginning of regular visits by highest-ranking officials from 
Belgrade and Zagreb, which in practice starts on 12 February 
when the FRY deputy prime minister will be received by Croatian 
President Franjo Tudjman. In Simic's opinion, this will, at the 
same time, be an inaugural meeting of the Commission for Missing 
Persons. 
  Serbian-Croatian relations can be successfully resolved only 
through bilateral efforts and this is an example of how to 
tackle the crisis in former Yugoslavia, said the Yugoslav deputy 
prime minister, concluding his statement for TANJUG.

  [Text] Today the Bucharest Territorial Military Court 
accepted the application of Andruta Ceausescu [brother of former 
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu], requesting that he should be 
released from jail for health reasons. 
  The judges decided to set Ceausescu free for the next six 
months, considering that he is suffering from illnesses that 
cannot be cured within the penitentiary system. 
  The ROMPRES news agency reminds us that, in his capacity as 
commander of the Baneasa school of Romania's Ministry of 
Interior, in December 1989 Andruta Ceausescu participated in the 
repression of demonstrators, after which he was sentenced to 15 
years imprisonment and reducing to the ranks, for attempted 
aggravated murder and the instigation of genocide.

<F P=106> [Statement by Corneliu Coposu, president of the National </F>
Peasant Christian Democratic Party, at a news conference in 
Bucharest on 24 January: "Mr. Coposu Warns: The Men in Power 
Will Be Kicked Out of Their Jobs Within 24 Hours of the Change 
of Regime!] 
  [Text] "The new government will agonize for a maximum 
three months after its creation. We do not give the new 
government, if it is created, more than three months to 
survive," Mr. Corneliu Coposu, president of the National Peasant 
Christian Democratic Party [PNTCD] said at a news conference 
yesterday. "This is a very short-term transitional government. 
According to our information, not even Mr. Ion Iliescu likes 
the idea of the Romanian National Unity Party [PUNR] joining the 
cabinet, since he is aware of the image as an extremist party 
that the PUNR 'enjoys' abroad. The new team will cause negative 
reactions and will be contested from the very start. The new 
ministers might not even obtain the endorsement of the 
parliament, although I do not see why the power should be afraid 
of that, since its holds the majority there... Anyhow, it is a 
strong proof of naivete on the part of the people in power to 
believe that, if they occupy all the decision-taking functions 
in the current society, they will stay nailed to their chairs. 
Actually, all these newly appointed people will be kicked out of 
their jobs within 24 hours of the change of regime..." 
  He also said that Romania risks being ejected from the 
Council of Europe if the government does not implement the nine 
amendments imposed by the aforementioned body within a maximum 
of six months from the date of adherence. A similar situation 
will occur if the former owners do not get back the assets 
confiscated by the communists and sue the Romanian state at the 
Council of Europe. "It is certain that the owners will win 
their cases and the restitution verdicts will have to be applied 
immediately," the PNTCD leader said. "Without foreign 
financing, the government will get bogged down in petty 
administrative activities, which will also be blocked themselves 
by the lack of money. But what is worse, I have yet to hear of 
a program from either the PUNR or the Social Democracy Party of 
Romania [PDSR]; their so-called salvation programs are nothing 
but fantasies. We have never considered Mr. Nicolae Vacaroiu to 
be an authentic prime minister, but rather a candidate for the 
position."

  [Excerpts] Belgrade, 27 Jan (TANJUG) -- Yugoslavia and 
Hungary agree that both sides should prepare for the period 
after the sanctions have been lifted in order to be ready 
immediately to expand their cooperation in all fields within the 
scope of their realistic potentials. This was said in Belgrade 
this evening during the first round of Yugoslav-Hungarian talks 
at foreign ministerial level. [passage omitted] 
  This evening [Hungarian Foreign Minister] Geza Jeszenszky 
briefed his hosts about the essence of Hungary's foreign policy 
and its European orientation. In this orientation, Jeszenszky 
said, priority is given to Hungary's relations with its 
neighbors, which, he was told, coincides with the Yugoslav 
orientation. 
  The Hungarian guest was told that the FRY is also 
Europe-oriented, that our country is very close to being 
admitted to the Council of Europe and other important European 
institutions, but is kept away from the European processes of 
integration with the outbreak of the Yugoslav crisis. 
  Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladimir Jovanovic informed his 
Hungarian counterpart and his associates about the present 
moment in the Yugoslav crisis, particularly about the war in 
Bosnia. He said that Yugoslavia made a great contribution to 
the establishment of a just peace in that former Yugoslav 
republic and that, unfortunately one side (Muslims) is not ready 
to accept a solution which the other two warring sides have 
accepted. Despite this the FRY will continue to invest efforts 
to stop the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to have the sanctions 
lifted. 
  Vladislav Jovanovic spoke at length about the sanctions 
against the FRY. He underscored that their maintenance leads to 
the escalation of the war in Bosnia and the destabilization of 
the Balkans. Besides, the Yugoslav foreign minister said, the 
sanctions are not only affecting the FRY but many other 
countries as well, especially neighboring ones. 
  In view of this, the Yugoslav side said, the FRY expects 
neighboring countries to more resolutely oppose the extension of 
the sanctions and hopes that Hungary will make an effort to have 
them lifted as soon as possible. 
  Opinions were also exchanged this evening on the activities 
of the CSCE. In this context, the talks centered on Hungary's 
role as a member of the so-called CSCE troika -- the former, the 
current, and the future chairing country -- as well as its role 
as that institution's chairing country next year. 
  The Yugoslav side expressed its readiness and wish to have 
Yugoslavia readmitted to the CSCE as a full-fledged member. 
However, it was stressed, such a decision should be made by 
those who had frozen Yugoslavia's membership and the FRY's 
readmittance should be dignified and without preconditions. 
[passage omitted] 
  Geza Jeszenszky was told this evening that Belgrade 
appreciates what Hungary has been doing so far in its relations 
with the FRY. Hungary is one of the few countries that refused 
to introduce visas for Yugoslav passport holders since the 
outbreak of the crisis, while other countries had done so for 
less justified reasons. Consequently, it is in Yugoslavia's 
interest to improve its ties with Hungary and to gradually 
promote cooperation in all areas relevant to the two countries' 
needs and potentials, Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky 
was told in Belgrade this evening.

  [Excerpt] Belgrade, 27 January (TANJUG) -- In reaction to 
the writings of certain papers and agencies which accuse the 
Yugoslav Army [VJ] of direct involvement in the war in Bosnia, 
the head of the information service of the Yugoslav Army's 
general staff, Colonel Ljubomir Stojadinovic, told TANJUG today 
that there were no VJ units on the territory of former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The high-ranking VJ officer further said: "We are not 
excluding the possibility that citizens of the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia -- former members of the VJ among them -- are 
fighting on the side of the Army of the Serb Republic as 
volunteers. We are certain that both the domestic and the world 
public are aware of the fact that a large number of mercenaries, 
fanatics, adventurers, and volunteers from the Islamic countries 
are fighting against the Serbs as members of the Muslim army in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Volunteers from the FRY, as free people, cannot be denied 
the 
right to decide on their own fate and fight for the survival of 
their people, especially since Islamic fanaticism has acquired 
planetary proportions in its struggle against the Serbs. 
  VJ troops and heavy weapons have not been moved towards 
Bosnia or any other state. They are deployed exclusively on the 
sovereign territory of the FRY, in accordance with assessments 
on the creation of the most favorable conditions for the defense 
of the sovereignty and peace of the FRY and its citizens. The 
latest accusations against the VJ directly justify these 
precautions," said the spokesman for the VJ general staff.

  [Text] Belgrade, 26 Jan (TANJUG) -- After a three-hour 
session this evening, deputies of the republican parliament 
failed to agree on a joint solution and decided to hold another 
discussion on Tuesday [1 February] on candidatures for president 
[speaker] of a new Serbian Assembly. The session was broken off 
after heads of the deputies' groups of five parliamentary 
parties -- in the absence of radicals -- agreed to resume the 
discussion on Tuesday in order to reach a compromise concerning 
the president of the Serbian Assembly.

  [Text] All preparations for the congress of the Serbian 
Radical Party have been completed. The Central Fatherland 
Administration of the party will be elected by a show of hands 
and the chairman will be elected by secret ballot among several 
candidates. This was what Party Chairman Vojislav Seselj 
announced at the regular news conference. The journalists' 
attention was mostly attracted by Radical's stands on the 
interparty agreements on the election of the new chairman of the 
republican parliament. Dragoljub Stankic has the details: 
  [Begin recording] [Stankic] It is the principled stand of 
the Serbian Radical Party that a member of an opposition party 
be elected Serbian Assembly chairman. The first solution, that 
Vuk Draskovic be elected, is unacceptable to the Radicals. The 
other proposal, the one that was accepted, failed to receive a 
sufficient number of votes, Vojislav Seselj said. Vuk Draskovic 
did not consult anybody about the second round of voting, but 
decided himself that the same proposal be given. We opposed 
that, Seselj said. 
  He said that he proposed that the candidate be a member of 
the Democratic Party or some other party and asked why that 
person had to be from Depos. We complied with everything that 
was agreed among the opposition parties, but we are not going to 
allow Vuk Draskovic to speak on behalf of the whole of the 
opposition, because he is not authorized to do so, Vojislav 
Seselj pointed out. He commented on the situation among the 
opposition parties as follows: 
  [Seselj] I do not think that an opposition bloc should be 
formed, nor do I think that there has been a rift among the 
opposition parties. A rift can only occur if there was unity 
before, and, in this case, no unity existed. We only agreed 
upon one specific question. 
  [Stankic] If there is an intervention by NATO, Seselj called 
on the Serbian people to oppose it with all means. In that 
case, one should respond fiercely against Croatian and Muslim 
targets and do so indiscriminately. And, as he put it, one 
should attack UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] units as well, 
wherever they may be. [end recording]

  [Text] Belgrade, 27 Jan (TANJUG) -- Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic this evening received Hungarian Foreign 
Minister Geza Jeszenszky who arrived in Belgrade today. In open 
talks, they exchanged views regarding the improvement of 
bilateral relations between Serbia, i.e. the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia, and Hungary, and also issues of importance for 
stability in the region. 
  Both sides concluded that they were interested in the 
development of good-neighborly relations based on the observance 
of equality, mutual respect, and noninterference in internal 
affairs. Special emphasis was placed on economic relations 
between the two countries for which conditions exist. It was 
stressed that economic sanctions against Serbia, i.e. the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, have been inflicting damage on 
the economies of both countries and that it was in their mutual 
interest that they be abolished as soon as possible. 
  Serbia attaches great importance to the potential for 
economic cooperation with Hungary, particularly in the sphere of 
energy, traffic, trade, and tourism. The Danube, as the largest 
European waterway, which links Serbia and Hungary and also other 
countries of the Danube region, represents an important economic 
advantage for both countries. In addition, as regards the 
overall development of traffic, it is important to construct a 
fast rail line from Belgrade to the Hungarian border, and also a 
modern Belgrade-Subotica highway that will enable the extension 
of more efficient economic links between partners in both 
countries. 
  It was also pointed out that the Hungarian and Serbian 
national minorities in the two countries objectively 
strengthened their interest in maintaining stable interstate 
relations and building mutual trust. It was emphasized that 
members of the Hungarian national minority in Serbia enjoyed all 
the rights guaranteed by the Serbian Constitution, in conformity 
with the highest standards prescribed by the CSCE documents and 
international law. 
  The two men also discussed efforts to wind up the peace 
process for former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Bearing in mind that the 
Republic of Serbia had made a great contribution in this 
respect, and that the Serb side had fulfilled its share of 
responsibilities stemming from the agreement reached with the 
European Union, hope was expressed that the international 
community would abandon its one-sided approach to the Yugoslav 
crisis and lift the economic sanctions. This means that Hungary, 
a neighboring country, should adopt an objective stance in line 
with its latest views on this subject, which would facilitate 
the surmounting of open questions and have a positive impact on 
the development of bilateral relations. 
  The meeting was also attended by Yugoslav Foreign Minister 
Vladislav Jovanovic, Serbian Assembly deputy [and leader of 
Vojvodina Hungarians] Andras Agoston, and others.

Gligorov received yesterday the CSCE High Commissioner on 
National Minorities Max Van der Stoel. During the talks, which 
were also attended by the head of the CSCE mission in Macedonia 
Ambassador Norman Anderson, they exchanged opinions on the 
current situation in the inter-ethnic relations and the 
acceptance of the Republic of Macedonia to the CSCE. 
  The High Commissioner Mr. Stoel highly assessed the efforts 
and policy in Macedonia for the development of the inter-ethnic 
relations. He expressed the conviction that regardless of the 
current problems, the development of these relations will 
continue in the function of the peace and stability in the 
country and in the region, which is a confirmed interest of the 
CSCE. At the same time, Mr. Stoel informed that the efforts in 
the CSCE for the acceptance of Macedonia were still continuing. 
  President Gligorov informed the High Commissioner about the 
current situation in the inter-ethnic relations and expressed 
concern over the latest attempts from the neighborhood to 
interfere from outside in the internal affairs of Macedonia and 
over the inter-party relations in Macedonia. Mr. Gligorov was 
convinced that the Republic of Macedonia will finally take its 
place at the CSCE, to the benefit of the stability and security 
of the south Balkan region.

  [Text] According to the calculations of the Republic 
Bureau for the Advancement of the Household, the January 
consumer basket is some 12.4 percent more expensive than the 
December one, while the December figure is 13 percent higher 
than in November. In November last year 4,970 denars were 
needed for the minimum required food for a four member family, 
in December 5,799, while during the first months of this year 
this figure rose to 6,519 denars. The price of the consumer 
basket is constantly rising and during the period 
January-December its value increased 2.5 times, that is, 276 
percent. The January basket on the other hand compared to the 
same last years has increased 300 percent. The indicators used 
to show this increase are the price increases of the milk, 
pastas, bread and the 11 percent increase in the price of milk.

  [Text] At a session of the Macedonian Parliament today, a 
deputy from the Albanian Party of Democratic Prosperity [name 
indistinct] accused the VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian 
Revolutionary Organization-Party of Macedonian National Unity] 
of following an anti-Macedonian policy. He claimed that members 
of the VMRO-DPMNE leadership frequently visited Bulgaria and 
obtained large amounts of money from there. 
  In reply to the charges, Dosta Dimovska, deputy chairman of 
the VMRO-DPMNE, accused the Albanian party, asserting that its 
leaders often travel to Albania to receive instructions and 
that, in practice, they place themselves at the service of a 
foreign state. 
  Stojan Andov, chairman of the Macedonian Parliament, offered 
his services as an arbitrator. He declared that Macedonia is a 
democratic state and everyone can travel anywhere he or she 
likes, but that people's deputies must conduct themselves in 
word and deed in their country's interests.

government in the talks about the possible transfer of the 
station from Munich to Prague. The decision has not been made 
yet, Pavel Pechacek said, and added that further talks on the 
topic will take place in Prague tomorrow. 
  In his words, however, the Czech section and the Institute 
of 
Free Europe and Liberty should move to Prague by the end of 
June. The talks on accommodating these sections favor the former 
building of the National Assembly. 
  According to Pavel Pechacek, representatives of RFE should 
have talks in Bratislava with the Slovak Government on Friday. 
According to Pechacek, the Slovak Government, in connection with 
its proposal to end the possibility of RFE broadcasts on Velke 
Kostolany, Poprad, and Presov transmitters, probably wants to 
offer an alternative solution.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Czech Radio Has Extended Its </F>
Long-Wave-Band and Medium-Wave-Band Broadcasts"] 
  [Text] Prague--Czech Radio will, for now, extend its 
broadcasts on the long-wave band until the end of February, and 
that with a 50-percent output. At the slightly reduced 
medium-wave band, Radiozurnal will stay until the end of 1994, 
Czech Radio Director General V. Jezek stated yesterday. 
  "We will reduce the medium-wave network by the reduction of 
the output of certain transmitters and their number. The 
50-percent output of the transmitters on the long-wave band will 
save us money without substantially affecting the content of the 
broadcasts. Thanks to the accommodating approach by the Ceske 
Radiokomunikace company [Czech Radiocommunications], we will not 
pay the lease tariff in February. While on the medium-wave band 
we have opted for this solution until the end of the year, we 
have extended the broadcasts by one month on the long-wave band 
because we must await the decision by economy ministers and the 
government," Jezek said. According to him, the economy ministers 
are to deal with the problem of Czech Radio on Tuesday, 1 
February. "Several bilateral talks are currently in progress, in 
which we are explaining our financial needs," Jezek said. 
  At the end of last year, because of the negative response on 
the part of the listeners to the proposed changes in the 
broadcasts of Czech Radio, Jezek decided to extend the 
broadcasts of the Radiozurnal station on the long- and 
medium-wave bands until 30 January. He also pointed out that, if 
the Finance Ministry does not announce the date and the amount 
of the increase of the license [subscription] fee by 20 January, 
or if the new license fees do not cover the already projected 
deficit and Radiozurnal's use of the long- and medium-wave 
bands, the Czech Radio management will definitely be forced to 
abandon the long-wave band on 1 February 1994. It will also have 
to substantially reduce the medium-wave broadcasts of 
Radiozurnal and, for the second half of 1994, "further reduce 
the programing plans of Czech Radio." 
  The current 20-koruna [Kc] license fee is to be increased to 
Kc25 or 29, and that probably on 1 March.

<F P=106> [Article by "joe, ctk": "Economic Crime Increased in 1993 by </F>
More Than 55 Percent"] 
  [Text] Prague--Economic crime, which recorded an increase 
of 6,581 incidents (i.e., 55 percent) in comparison with 1992, 
is the fastest-growing form of crime. According to the 
statistics of the Czech Republic Police, the growth of economic 
crime surpassed even the so-far most widespread property-related 
crime, which rose 15.4 percent last year in comparison with 
1992, and violent crime, with its increase of 6.7 percent. 
Policemen specializing in this field, the number of whom 
remained virtually unchanged last year, managed to solve 77.1 
percent of the offenses in the sphere of economic crime (it was 
83 percent in 1992). 
  The almost 18,500 economic offenses resulted in damages in 
excess of 4.2 billion korunas [Kc] last year. Because the police 
statistics cover only proven cases, the police staff 
specializing in this area estimate the actual extent of the 
damages to be far higher. The volume of ascertained economic 
crimes will apparently continue to grow in the years to come 
because many so-far-undetected cases may be discovered by the 
control activity of the financial authorities. Economic crime 
currently comprises primarily embezzlement and fraud, but there 
is also a high percentage of larceny (including the theft of 
shipments), bribery, unauthorized enterprise, smuggling, illegal 
currency trading, transgression of economic discipline, 
unauthorized use of vehicles that do not belong to the user, etc. 
  On a long-term basis, property-related crime (particularly 
burglary and simple theft) dominates among its individual forms. 
With its more than 327,000 cases, it represents about 82 percent 
of all crimes. The total damage caused by property-related 
crimes surpassed Kc9.6 billion, and only 21 percent of them have 
been solved.

<F P=106> [Report by Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and </F>
foreugn minister, to the Chamber of Deputies in Zagreb on 26 
January -- recorded] 
  [Text] Esteemed deputies: The peaceful reintegration of 
the temporarily occupied territories, the efforts to advance and 
consolidate relations with our neighbors, the very urgent need 
at the present juncture to halt the Muslim offensive in central 
Bosnia, and our participation in European processes of 
integration remain the main goals of Croatian policy. 
  As for the world position of the Republic of Croatia, over 
the last few weeks the president of the Republic personally and 
the government and our diplomats have been totally preoccupied 
with, and have spent most energy in, putting in order relations 
with neighboring countries. Relations with neighbors are always 
seen as the first criterion that the international community 
uses to assess the policy in general, the level of its 
democratic development, and the level of civilization in a 
country. In the case of young countries and democracies such as 
Croatia, the world relies on the nature of their relations with 
their neighbors to assess the level of their maturity and their 
capability to join integrational process on a wider scale. 
  In addition, when outlining the strategic attributes of our 
foreign policy, we placed our relations with neighbors at the 
very top. Namely, we cannot enter Europe over the heads of our 
neighbors. We made efforts of differing intensity and at 
different times but with the same amount of dedication to 
normalize -- in some cases to remove the initial and in some the 
old obstacles on the road towards full normalization of 
relations with the countries in our immediate and near 
neighborhood: with Bosnia-Herzegovina, with the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia, Serbia, Montenegro, with Slovenia, with Italy, 
and even with Macedonia. We can proudly say that in relations 
with some of our neighbors, we no longer need to put anything in 
order but only try and advance them. I refer here to Hungary 
and Austria. However, I firmly believe that one day we shall 
come before this chamber to talk only about further improvements 
in goodneighborly relations of the democratic, sovereign, and 
integrated republic of Croatia, which we aspire towards and 
which is our prime goal. 
  In any case, all we did in the preceding period was governed 
by this goal. However, it should be stressed that at the same 
time we have made and will continue to make considerable efforts 
to bring forward the date when Croatia will join many of the 
European and world processes. 
  The president of the Republic, Dr Franjo Tudjman, headed our 
state delegations at negotiations in Bonn, Brussels, and Geneva. 
In addition, he met a large number of world statesmen. In 
Zagreb he had meetings with a member of the U.S. Government, 
Ambassador Madeleine Albright, former French president Valerie 
Giscard d'Estaing and the cochairmen of the international 
conference. 
  I have just returned from a visit to the Council of Europe 
-- 
that inevitable and decisive stop on the road to functional 
integration in the European Union. Prime Minister Valentic and 
I talked with the Slovenes in Ljubljana yesterday. I had a very 
successful visit to Bulgaria, I will be meeting Italian Foreign 
Minister Benjamino Andreatta in Rome at the beginning of 
February. We plan to initiate a procedure geared towards joining 
the process known as Partnership for Peace under the auspices of 
NATO and we are conducting bilateral talks within the framework 
of the CSCE on regional security arrangements both in the 
Mediterranean and in this part of Europe. 
  The normalization of relations with our neighbors, regional 
security arrangements, participation in the Partnership for 
Peace and membership in the European Union and NATO itself -- 
with an active role in economic arrangements -- this is part of 
the network of the continuous activities and logical objectives 
of Croatia's foreign policy. The realization of these 
objectives perfectly, clearly, and permanently determines the 
position of the sovereign, unified, and integral Republic of 
Croatia in Europe and the world. 
  It occasionally happens in this process that our efforts are 
not in proportion to the results just as it happens that a 
positive result can be reached unexpectedly owing to a favorable 
alignment of circumstances. However, this is also a process 
where even the longest journeys begin with a first step in which 
politics are an art of the possible but in which the essence and 
objective are always clearly defined and unmistakably in the 
interest of the Croatian state, the Croatian nation, and all 
citizens of the Republic of Croatia. 
  In this respect, most of the attention of the Croatian and 
foreign public over the past couple of days was focused on the 
joint [Serbian-Croatian] declaration signed in Geneva on 20 
January. Before this, an equal degree of attention was 
commanded by our negotiations with the Muslim side. Both talks 
were conducted within the framework of the international 
conference as well as through numerous bilateral channels and 
mediatory efforts. The talks have a continuity, sometimes they 
are mutually interdependent and they are also known to have 
affected the development of events in the UN Protected Areas. 
  We should reiterate this clearly: Croatia is not conducting 
talks with anybody to the detriment of a third, absent party. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, when it comes to Croatia, the goal of 
both negotiations is the normalization of Croatian-Serb 
relations and interstate relations with the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia and the permanent resolution of overall 
Croatian-Muslim relations. We entered these talks guided by the 
principles of our peace-loving policy and obligations stemming 
from our participation in the international peace conference. 
  But at every moment we were deeply aware that the war of 
aggression within the Greater Serbia project is the main reason 
for and the only real source of the crisis and all the 
indescribable suffering both in Croatia and in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Hence, at that time we gave priority to our 
relations with the Muslims, while we have achieved considerable 
and important results in out relations with the Serbian side. 
  However, it is beyond any doubt and it comes as proof of our 
priorities that we offered much more to the Muslim side and are 
still offering it under certain conditions: a treaty on the 
establishment of a permanent and global peace between the Croat 
and the Bosnian Muslim nations in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the 
foundations of their coexistence. Such a proposal was 
repeatedly offered to them in Bonn, Brussels, and Geneva. This 
is a precondition for the permanent normalization of relations. 
It is actually a proposal for an alliance between two nations 
and two states, for halting the war, eliminating consequences of 
the aggression and destruction, and for long-lasting and 
mutually beneficial cooperation in all spheres from the economy, 
to security and foreign policy. 
  For such a proposal which is in essence a refinement of the 
overall and consistent Croatian policy towards 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and also a further expansion of the peace 
initiative, Croatia and her president received numerous praises 
from foreign statesmen: in Bonn, Brussels and Geneva, and also 
at many meetings with foreign ministers Kinkel, Claes, Cetin, 
Hurd, Mrs af Ugglas, [name indistinct], and Mock. 
  Despite such offers and such assessments of our policies and 
efforts, there have been no satisfactory results so far that 
could place the progress achieved in our relations with the Serb 
side in the right perspective and context. I am deeply 
convinced of the existence of such a possibility, and we shall 
do our utmost in this respect, because the normalization of 
relations with the Muslims and their state entity in wartime, 
and especially in peace, is of strategic importance for and in 
the interest of the Croats and the Republic of Croatia. 
  The joint Geneva declaration is an important political 
document, maybe even a crucial step in the normalization of 
relations between the two signatory countries and an important 
contribution to the beginning of the establishment of a lasting 
peace, stability, and security in this part of Europe. If the 
Serb side displays goodwill, this document will determine the 
future course of the normalization of the situation in both 
states and the normalization of relations between the two states 
and it will also have an impact on the position of minorities in 
these states. This is a document whose final form was shaped by 
the international community, but also by the dynamics of the 
international conference on former Yugoslavia. 
  This declaration contains several elements that could be 
relevant to UN Security Council Resolution 871 -- in case a real 
peace is achieved -- inter-state relations were mentioned, 
offices are being opened. It was said that the two sides should 
be guided by the principles of the UN Charter and the basic 
tenets of the CSCE in the establishment of goodneighborly 
relations. Moreover, an official statement from Belgrade calls 
on the Serbs in Croatia to regulate their relations with the 
Croatian authorities in the Republic of Croatia. This 
represents the first, and very important, step in the 
normalization of relations between Zagreb and Belgrade and it 
should lead to the establishment of full diplomatic relations. 
This is also an important step towards the peaceful 
reintegration of the UN Protected Areas into the constitutional, 
legal, political, and economic system of our country which would 
effectively finalize the integrity of the sovereign Republic of 
Croatia. 
  This once again reiterates Croatia's determination to 
establish peace in these areas and to restore and consolidate 
stability and security, primarily through political means, in 
other words through dialogue and negotiations in an atmosphere 
of goodwill and respect for the individual interests of the two 
sides and for the efforts outlined in the documents of the 
international community such as the European Union's action plan 
and relevant documents of the UN Security Council and General 
Assembly. The international community has already expressed and 
will continue to give us support for this policy. If we 
continue to pursue this policy, we will move closer not only to 
finding genuine and lasting solutions but also to the political, 
European milieu to which we belong historically. 
  It is important to stress that both the comprehensive offer 
made in Bonn to the Muslim side and the joint declaration 
consistently reflect the basic idea and the logical theme of 
President Tudjman's peace initiative and to a large extent 
represent a concrete step toward implementing it. As a vital 
step toward the day when the two sovereign states are eventually 
recognized within their international borders the declaration is 
seen as being of crucial importance for contributing to and 
enhancing the effectiveness of the international conference and 
for helping to implement all the points in the European Union's 
action plan on the so-called modus vivendi, or rather of 
Resolution 871 which is so crucial to us. 
  Any delay in normalizing Croat-Serb relations, or rather the 
absence of any shifts in them hamper the efforts to normalize 
the situation in this part of Europe. Accordingly, any shift in 
this sphere must be welcomed and supported. 
  However, while on the one hand we will continue to normalize 
relations with the Serb side in order to accomplish our own 
objectives as soon as possible -- in particular those concerning 
the temproarily occupied territories -- on the other, we will 
again try to restore dialogue with the Muslims to tackle all 
vital issues, including the territorial integrity of the two 
entities in a future state, releasing prisoners, normalizing the 
humanitarian situation, in particular, providing gurantees for 
the free passage of humanitarian convoys, and the general state 
of relations -- in other words, harmonizing our Bonn proposal 
with their reply to us in Geneva recently. 
  The Bonn proposal for negotiations and agreements to benefit 
both peoples and peace in this part of Europe will remain on 
long-term offer. However, the Muslim side's current behavior 
demonstrates a lack of genuine desire to find a lasting and 
systematic solution to Croat-Muslim relations and to 
establishing appropriate relations with the Croatian state. 
  There are very clear indications that the Muslim side wishes 
to invalidate and reject the Geneva documents on the 
establishment and set-up of the union of republics of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. In the negotiations, and even more so in 
its public relations, the Muslim side very skillfully evades and 
jumps from the concept of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina to 
the union of the republics and then into the Bosniak Muslim 
entity, mixing and intertwining the actual situation on the 
ground with the real level which has been achieved in 
negotiations. 
  In addition to this, by repeatedly issuing demands for the 
replacement of the negotiating forum, it has been trying to 
return the negotiations to square one. This has considerably 
burdened our negotiations, because the other side's definition 
is constantly changing. In negotiations, and even more so 
through its behavior in the field, the Muslim side has shown 
that it was not ready to recognize the equality and 
constitutionality of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, nor 
is it ready to recognize all indisputable achievements of the 
struggle of the Croat people and the realization of its right to 
self-determination expressed through the establishment of the 
Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. 
  By shunning the union of the republics, which is the level 
of 
the resolution achieved in objective terms in the negotiating 
process, and which is a euphemism for the agreement reached 
aboard the "Invincible", back to the model of the republics of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Muslim leadership is in reality trying 
to negate the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. 
  The current Muslim offensive in central Bosnia, with its 
horrific proportions, duration, and tragic consequences, most 
obviously proves the lack of real will and reveals the genuine 
intentions of the current Muslim leadership -- the eviction of 
the Croats from their historic and ethnic areas in central 
Bosnia. This is in complete contravention of the fundamental 
documents and constitutional principles of the present-day 
republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the principles of the set-up 
and demarcation within the union of the republics of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  This entitles and obligates the president, the assembly, and 
the government of the Republic of Croatia, in line with the 
constitution and their own conscience, to do everything in the 
political, diplomatic, humanitarian, and every other legitimate 
field in order not only to stop that merciless offensive but 
also to secure the survival of the Croats and guarantee them a 
life worthy of human beings in those historically ethnic Croat 
areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Croats must remain in their 
homes in central Bosnia, which is in the interest of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and of peace in this part of Europe. 
  Despite everything, we again call on Bosnian Muslim 
representatives to continue negotiations in good faith so that a 
permanent and just solution for all sides be achieved, peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina restored, a permanent community of equal 
constitutive nations set up, and conditions for their 
coexistence be preserved. If the Muslim offensive is halted it 
is not yet too late for politics and negotiations. At the same 
time we again wish to express the readiness of the Croatian side 
to work toward and persevere in reaching precisely such a 
political, peaceful, negotiated and mutually beneficial solution. 
  In the course of the last meeting between two delegations, 
i.e. between presidents Tudjman and Izetbegovic, certain 
progress was achieved as regards [Muslim] access to the sea, 
without calling into question the territorial integrity of the 
Republic of Croatia. An agreement in principle on Mostar and the 
hydroelectric system on the Neretva River was also achieved. 
However, the important problem of central Bosnia remains to be 
solved: In this respect demands by the Bosnian Muslim side were 
ultimatum-like and thwarted any agreement. At the same time 
Izetbegovic's sudden demands as regards central Bosnia called 
into question the very principle, which has been one of the 
foundations of the negotiating process so far and which had been 
coordinated by all three sides, according to which the Croats in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina would get 17.5 percent of the territory. 
  Esteemed ladies and gentlemen. Let me say just a few words 
about our relations with Slovenia: A meeting that took place in 
Ljubljana yesterday between the prime ministers and ministers of 
foreign affairs of our two neighboring states was, in many 
aspects, a great step forward in the removal of obstacles 
burdening bilateral relations, i.e., as Prime Minister Nikica 
Valentic stressed after the talks, it transpires that no problem 
is of such a nature as to prevent the interest of the two 
nations and the two states in the establishment of better and 
friendlier relations. 
  In brief, as regards open issues, a complete agreement on 
the 
Krsko nuclear power plant is likely to be reached by the end of 
the summer; we have coordinated a trade agreement as a framework 
for the future exchange on the free trade principle, and also an 
agreement on payment transactions. In a few days we could 
settle the issue of our property relations. Standpoints 
regarding Ljubljanska Banka have been clarified and brought 
closer, agreements on air traffic, fishing, and cooperation in 
culture and education have either been completed or are nearing 
completion. Through treaties on employment and social security, 
which are also nearing completion, the issue of employment of 
Croatian citizens in the Republic of Slovenia will be resolved. 
A joint commission will continue work on the demarcation of the 
border line. 
  The Croatian side presented to the Slovene side a proposal 
in 
writing on the Bay of Piran with a number of interesting 
solutions as regards political, customs and ecological control 
and fishing. In line with these proposals, Piran would become a 
linking bay -- not a contentious issue on which international 
mediation could make decisions should it become necessary. 
  An increase in bilateral trade between the two neighbors was 
singled out as one of the most urgent tasks. Finally, it was 
agreed that the same delegations meet again in Zagreb on 7 
February to sign the agreements that have already been 
coordinated and to continue the dialogue. 
  As regards our relations with Italy, i.e., the forthcoming 3 
February meeting and talks with Foreign Minister Beniamino 
Andreatta in Rome, I would like to stress that on that occasion 
we wish to remove all remaining misunderstandings in our 
relations and thus give a fresh impetus to the 
good-neighborliness of the two states. For us, Italy is not 
only one of the most important business partners, but is also an 
influential state and a factor creating European and world 
politics to which we are inevitably inclined, and with which we 
are very closely cooperating in regional organizations, such as 
the central European initiative or Alpe-Adria. We are convinced 
that Italy will play an even more important role in the 
resolution of the crisis in this area and also in the peace-time 
reconstruction. 
  My visit to the Council of Europe in the course of which I 
had numerous complex, but very important talks, showed that it 
understood our position, but also that Croatia can and must do 
most on its own. Further strengthening and widening of 
democracy in all its forms is our first and fundamental 
imperative. Croatia has kept its special guest status in the 
Council of Europe, while the change of that status will depend 
on the development of the situation, the nature and the course 
of a denouement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Esteemed deputies. We attach great importance to the recent 
NATO summit, bearing in mind the pivotal position of this 
organization in the building of an adequate system of security 
and stability in Europe and the world in general. Our 
particular attention was attracted by decisions on further 
strengthening of the so-called NATO European component, or wing, 
on the basis of the development and strengthening of the 
European Union, i.e., the WEU [Western European Union]. Croatia 
supports NATO standpoints on political and security priorities, 
particularly as regards support for the stabilization of new 
European democracies, the further improvement of the CSCE 
process and mechanisms, the struggle against terrorism, and arms 
control and disarmament. 
  Even though some NATO standpoints are inadequate when it 
comes to the real state of affairs and the need to establish 
security in our continent, particularly as regards crises in 
areas such as the Balkans, we derive hope from the fact that 
NATO has expressed its awareness of the interdependability of 
security in all democratic European states, and readiness in 
principle to gradually extend its membership. In this sense an 
invitation was sent to European states and CSCE members to 
develop direct cooperation in practice with NATO through 
Partnership for Peace. Principles and goals of Partnership for 
Pease are in their essence in agreement with Croatia's 
standpoints and its long-term interests, and therefore we 
welcome them expressing our readiness to join the implementation 
of that initiative. 
  We are not regarding our possible participation in the 
Partnership from the standpoint of our current defense needs and 
interests, but rather as a way and modus of standardization and 
long-term inclusion of our defense system and forces into the 
institutional framework for the defense of the democratic order, 
security and stability in Europe and the world in general. 
  Ladies and gentlemen. We have achieved significant moves 
forward in the strengthening of our international position and 
thus our internal security. We have approached our main goal by 
several more steps. But in the forthcoming period very complex 
tasks, fresh huge challenges are awaiting us. Quick 
breakthroughs are possible, but also long-lasting frustrations 
in the implementation of our fundamental policy. It will be 
necessary to make quick decisions, react quickly and even more 
quickly adapt to circumstances in order to achieve our strategic 
goals to an optimum degree and fulfil our national task 
consistently. 
  We are leaving the war behind and entering peace and Europe, 
being aware that forces that pull us back are still strong. Two 
words are decisive in this connection: National unity and the 
future of the nation and the state. Therefore I call on you to 
unite and give support to each other when it comes to our mutual 
goal. Let me paraphrase a well-known statesman: Let's not allow 
the opening up of disputes between the past and the present lest 
we should find out at one moment that we have lost the future. 
  Thank you, madam deputy speaker.

  [Excerpt] Belgrade, 27 Jan (TANJUG) -- The Foreign Ministry 
of the republic of Serb Krajina sent a letter today to all 
diplomatic and consular missions in Belgrade, warning that the 
text carried by the 24 January newsletter of the U.S. Embassy in 
Belgrade was written in the spirit of the falsehoods concocted 
by the Croatian propaganda headquarters. 
  The letter, also forwarded to TANJUG, says that by writing 
the article in the US embassy's newsletter, Madeleine Albright 
-- the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations -- had "abused the 
hospitality of the Serbian people and overstepped the norms of 
diplomatic conduct" because she called on "all countries to help 
the war crimes tribunal." 
  The text implies that "the Ovcara mass grave near Vukovar 
contains evidence about Serbian crimes against the Croats -- 
something the European civilization of the 20th Century ought to 
be ashamed of." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Fadil Smajic] </F>
  [Text] The leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy arrived late this afternoon for a four-day 
visit to Slovenia. Zhirinovskiy calls his visit a vacation, and 
after a series of bombastic statements, he has chosen Portoroz 
and Bled as the places for his vacation. The controversial 
Russian politician arrived accompanied by six bodyguards, 
although his headquarters consider that there will be no 
excessive scandals during Zhirinovskiy's stay in Slovenia. 
Zhirinovskiy will hold a news conference for domestic and 
foreign journalists in Bled tomorrow. 
  Zhirinovskiy is otherwise in contact with the 
National-Socialist Alliance of Slovenia, an extreme right party 
from Velenje, at whose invitation he has actually arrived. Via 
the Russian Embassy in Ljubljana, he has told them that he would 
not be able to attend this party's congress, which will be held 
on 12 February. However, he will be represented by Alexey 
Ivanovich (?Lepenkin), who is at the same time also an official 
of the Russian Embassy in Ljubljana. 
  As the prelude to his visit in Slovenia, since it was 
questionable whether he would get a Slovene entry visa, 
Zhirinovskiy issued a message to the Slovene Government, the 
Foreign Ministry, and the Slovene public. In this message he 
says that he considers Slovenia to be a highly developed and 
highly cultured central European country that, following the 
disintegration of Yugoslavia, broke off with its Balkan past, 
even though it now influences considerably the outcome of the 
crisis in the Balkans. Zhirinovskiy, among other things, further 
says, I quote: Myself and the party are interested in dialogue 
with the official representatives of your country regarding an 
as quick as possible end to the bloodshed in Bosnia and the 
recognition of the new reality on the Yugoslav territory. End 
quote. 
  In his message to the Slovenes, Zhirinovskiy favors the 
recognition of the states that have emerged in the Balkans 
within their internationally recognized borders and then adds a 
sentence that certainly will not go unnoticed in Slovenia. The 
message is: We favor that Russia becomes a guarantor of the 
security, stability, and independence of Slovenia.

  [Text] Warsaw, 28 Jan--President Lech Walesa today received 
Israel's Knesset Speaker Shevah Weiss, who has been on a 
parliamentary visit to Poland. 
  Weiss handed the president a letter from Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, in which he recalls the importance of 
the visit to Israel by Lech Walesa and underscores that Poland 
occupies an important place in Europe. Prime Minister Rabin 
writes that everything connected with the known 
Israeli-Palestinian declaration is most important in Israeli 
policy. 
  During talks in the Belweder Palace, reference was also made 
to history and the contemporary issues of both states and the 
world. President Walesa said that Poland is presented so far as 
a cemetery of our (Polish and Jewish) nations. He called for 
looking into the future and focusing on the youth and their 
upbringing. He also underscored that Poland is a victim of the 
betrayal by "the great of this world."

<F P=106> [Interview with Polish President Lech Walesa by Jozef Huebel </F>
in Warsaw on 24 January: "There Are No Contradictions; We Just 
Do Not Know"] 
  [Text] On the occasion of the visit by Slovak 
President Michal Kovac to Poland on 25-27 January, Polish 
President Lech Walesa answered four questions from SME via our 
collaborator in Warsaw, STV correspondent Jozef Huebel. 
  [Huebel] Mr. President, there are many unsolved problems 
between Poland and Slovakia: We have only nine border 
crossings, while there were 40 of them before the war. Slovak 
korunas cannot be legally exchanged in Polish banks and, vice 
versa, your zlotys cannot be exchanged in Slovak banks. Neither 
the "Carpathian Euroregion" nor the "Tatras Euroregion" projects 
have made any progress. A joint Polish-Slovak bank still does 
not exist, and signatures are also missing on the treaty on 
prevention of double taxation and protection of investments. We 
have not correlated our customs policy. When are these problems 
going to be solved? 
  [Walesa] I said once that, by the year 2000, Poland will 
remove all borders that separate our country from its neighbors. 
The border should be marked only by good directional signs and 
computers so that every traveler can choose the best alternative 
route for the remainder of his trip. I am doing everything in 
my power so that no border stands between us by the year 2000. 
Only, we must even our standards by then. People are like 
communicating vessels: If there is a difference in levels, a 
Niagara Falls forms. He who has seen them knows how the water 
thunders, falls heavily, and finally shatters. If the levels 
match, however, there is no movement, and it is completely safe. 
That is one of the reasons we should well consider our 
differences, so that we can reach this safety. If we even up 
wages, prices, standards, roads, and computers, our unification 
will be so fast we will not even notice it. Therefore, let us 
collaborate to even up the standards of our communities, and the 
border will not be needed. 
  [Huebel] I will ask a somewhat unpleasant question now: Why 
do the representatives of our countries--Poland and 
Slovakia--meet so infrequently? After all, the Slovak Republic 
has been here for more than a year, you have not come for an 
official visit, the Polish prime minister has not been there, 
either, and this visit by President Kovac is the first 
significant visit in our mutual relations. Will that be amended? 
  [Walesa] Yes, of course. I have said many times that both 
you and we have numerous domestic problems now and are engrossed 
in them. It has to be kept in mind, however, that we are 
building an economic and legal structure, and the presidents and 
the other officials have so many worries that they do not have 
time for anything else. We will try to rectify this, but we can 
manage only if we succeed in solving our problems. We will then 
have time also for "external" issues. 
  [Huebel] Mr. President, would it not be possible to use 
precisely the Polish-Slovak cooperation as an example to the 
West that something exists here and that the Visegrad Group has 
good prospects because of this cooperation? 
  [Walesa] Of course, I take it! The situation calls for 
this. It calls for our initiating something. It calls for our 
relations to be the best, better than between other nations. 
Again, however, it must be done. There is no doubt that the 
politicians and the leaders understand each other. We really 
get along well and speak as in a single voice. On the other 
hand, we have no idea of technical, ministerial, and directorial 
solutions--i.e., of a technical concept how to do all of this. 
Unfortunately, so far we have not found a method to accelerate 
it all. There are no contradictions; we just do not know. 
  [Huebel] The stability of our region and the success of the 
cooperation of the Visegrad Four depends to a great degree on 
Hungarian-Slovak relations. How do you feel about the problem 
of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia and the "Gabcikovo" issue? 
  [Walesa] This problem is here to stay. If the process of 
European integration were faster, this problem would not exist. 
That is because the European principles and various treaties 
state that everyone has the right to freedom and his 
characteristic features--but within the borders of integral 
Europe. Under such circumstances, no one would attempt a 
division, even if certain groups wanted to preserve their 
specific features, but, as I say, in a single house! Because 
these attempts at agglomeration are not very successful, new 
attempts at division ensue. Therefore, I believe that we will 
be able to enter Europe together, rather than go on subdividing. 
These partitions are not necessary.

  [Text] Katowice, 27 Jan--The Board of the Katowice Region 
of the "Kontra" Trade Union decided today to transform itself 
into a regional strike committee [RKS], committee chairman 
Krzysztof Fijalkowski reports. 
  "Trade unionists envisage strikes in the mining sector, and 
that is why it has been decided to create the RKS. For the time 
being, we have declared a strike alert in the mines. We have 
marked out specific dates for strikes, Andrzej Andrzejczak, the 
chairman of the "Kontra" National Commission [KK] said, but he 
nonetheless declined to cite them. 
  The RKS demands from the government that, among other 
things, 
it equalizes disproportions in pay for miners and that it 
restore the ratio of pay for miners to the national average at a 
level of 2:1; hold back increases in prices; enact immediate 
debt restructuring for mines; and create a mining bank, which 
would allow mines to be made independent of the "usurious rates 
of the banks." 
  "Kontra" also demands that mining be recognised as a 
strategic industry, that the government promises to procure 
permanent coal reserves, that annual and anniversary bonuses be 
free of tax, and that the right to a retirement pension after 21 
years' work underground be introduced.

  [Text] The talks between the Protest Committee formed by 
"Solidarity" ["S"], "Solidarity '80" ["S'80"], "Kontra" of the 
Confederation for an Independent Poland, and the Board of 
Directors of the Jastrzebie Coal Partnership have not yielded 
any results. The unionists insist on 15-percent wage increases. 
The board is prepared to give them only half of that. The 
miners are still occupying the company's seat, whereas the board 
is remaining in the building of the Chief Technical 
Organization. Talks have been broken off; while waiting for the 
talks to be resumed, the miners prepared a poster newspaper that 
is being distributed at the Jastrzebie mines. They turn 
directly to the prime minister; they write mainly about the sale 
of the Silesian Bank. This is what they wrote in the paper: 
  "Mr. Prime Minister Pawlak, what is going on? The miners of 
three trade union centers--'S,' 'S'80,' and 'Kontra'--are 
protesting the continuous decrease in real wages. They want 
more for their hard and dangerous work. The owner--that is, the 
industry minister, who is a member of your government--says `no' 
to the modest demands of the miners. At the same time, the 
ownership transformations minister allows huge and unjustified 
fortunes to be made in only one day. The loss that we all 
incurred as a result of the sale of the Silesian Bank is 
unimaginable to the miners. We want only a 15-percent raise, 
which is a fraction of 1 percent of the money that was stolen 
from the Poles. Mr. Pawlak, we know what is going on. We also 
know the saying: `If you do not know how to do things, do not 
shoulder your way to the limelight.' We remember well those 
declarations: `The situation does not have to be like this.' 
Now we are saying: `The situation must be changed!'"

<F P=106> [Article by R.W.: "Proportionality in Gminas; SLD Wants </F>
Change of Electoral Law Soon"] 
  [Text] Proportionate elections to councils in all 
gminas [small administrative units], regardless of their 
size--such is the most important principle of a draft of a new 
electoral law that has been submitted before the Sejm by a group 
of Sejm deputies for the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. The 
authors of the draft gave up a few of the provisions that had 
been submitted before but that were sharply criticized (as 
aiming to make local elections overly political); these 
provisions pertained first of all to direct elections of 
wojtowie [chief officers of groups of villages] and mayors. The 
authors of the draft also gave up the idea of distributing the 
same electoral list numbers among the parties as they had during 
the parliamentary elections. The authors of the draft think 
that the draft should be debated as soon as possible by a 
specially created Extraordinary Commission. 
  "Whatever it is possible to save, from among the principles 
applied during elections to the Sejm, must be maintained with 
regard to local elections"--this is how Sejm Deputy Ryszard 
Grodzicki of the SLD explained, during Wednesday's [26 January] 
press conference, why the authors of the draft want to see a 
uniformization of the election system and proportionate 
elections to gmina councils everywhere. Up to now, this kind of 
elections took part only in those gminas whose population 
exceeded 40,000 people. In smaller gminas, elections took place 
in one-seat districts: Whoever won became the gmina council 
member for his particular district. "Such elections were 
accidental and did not reflect the configuration of forces 
within gminas," Grodzicki says. 
  "Fears of allegedly rendering local elections overly 
dependent on political parties are unjustified," says Professor 
Stanislaw Gebethner, an expert for the SLD. According to him, 
the June elections will demonstrate a weakness by all of the 
parties, with groups of citizens being the primary winners. 
"Individual candidates will have no chance," Sejm Deputy 
Grodzicki admits. But he also adds that any party wanting to 
run in the elections in a particular gmina will have to collect 
an appropriate number of signatures, which would support that 
party's list. "There is no danger of a formalized structure 
submitting its candidates without the inhabitants' support," 
Grodzicki says. According to the draft, 15-150 signatures are 
enough for submitting a list. 
  To secure places in gmina councils for people who are 
popular 
in the particular gmina regardless of the their political 
affiliation, SLD activists are proposing that anyone who manages 
to gain 7-percent support can become a council member, even if, 
according to electoral-law arithmetic, his list will not be 
taken into account in seat distribution. 
  According to Sejm Deputy Krzysztof Janik, there were three 
reasons for the SLD's giving up the idea of direct elections of 
wojtowie and mayors by all inhabitants of a gmina. First of 
all, there emerged a fear that the Small Constitution might have 
to be changed. Second, there emerged "significant opposition by 
political groups and by those parts of parliamentary clubs that 
have the power of shaping opinions." Third, the SLD wanted to 
avoid being accused of settling its own party interests. 
  "We can see no particular benefits for ourselves from the 
introduction of the new electoral law," says Ryszard Grodzicki. 
According to Krzysztof Janik, the SLD is eager to see political 
parties strengthened, whereas the new election system is 
supposed to be conducive to that. 
  Janik also announced that Sejm deputies for the SLD will 
return (although not at the time of the next elections) at some 
point to the idea of directly electing mayors and wojtowie. 
They will also submit a proposal for an electoral law with 
regard to self-governmental powiat [small administrative units] 
councils "in the near future." That will be done along with 
other draft laws pertaining to powiats.

<F P=106> [Article by Z.L.: "Meeting of General Staff With President </F>
and Prime Minister"] 
  [Text] According to generals of the General Staff's 
strict leadership, the Army's budget planned for this year "is 
not conducive to the implementation of tasks that Poland's 
interests determine for the Armed Forces." 
  According to the generals, a lack of funds not only makes it 
difficult to implement tasks that have already been planned but 
also determines the fact that the process of the Army's 
technical deterioration will not be stopped. 
  This pessimistic analysis was presented to President Lech 
Walesa, commander in chief of the Armed Forces, and Prime 
Minister Waldemar Pawlak during their first visit to the Polish 
Army's General Staff on Thursday [27 January]. In the presence 
of Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk and Mieczyslaw 
Wachowski, minister of state in the President's Office, the 
officers presented results of analyses and of conceptual work 
pertaining to the Army's new model. The meeting was closed to 
the press. 
  According to the plans, an "aerial-mobile," land-aerial army 
is to be established within two years, whose basis will be 
provided by armored forces, landing-storming forces, the air 
force, and aerial cavalry, Major Mariusz Jedrzejko told us. He 
is the spokesman for the Collegium of Armed Forces' Commanders 
of the Republic of Poland and the only person authorized to 
inform the press on the contents of Thursday's talks. The only 
reason the General Staff could be happy with the talks (the 
General Staff, according to recent announcements by its chief, 
General Tadeusz Wilecki, is to become the chief institution for 
commanding the Polish Republic's Armed Forces) was that there 
were unanimous declarations made by both the head of state and 
the Cabinet chief that they care very much for defense issues. 
  President Walesa and Prime Minister Pawlak announced that 
they will support the necessary legislative changes that would 
make it possible to continue with the reforms in the area of the 
defense system. They also expressed their interest in the idea 
of establishing a National Defense Fund that would collect 
financial means from society. These would then be devoted 
primarily to purchasing modern combat equipment.

  [Excerpts] President Michal Kovac returned from his 
official visit to Poland just over an hour ago. Today he 
visited the Royal Palace on Wawel Hill in Krakow and then met 
the representatives of the Slovak community in Poland. During 
the flight home, Michal Michalcik interviewed the president on 
his visit. 
  [Begin recording] [Michalcik] [passage omitted] To what 
extent do you feel that the intentions with which you went on 
your first visit to Poland were fulfilled? 
  [Kovac] I think that, in some aspects, the visit was 
succesful beyond my expectations. [passage omitted] It would 
certainly have been more effective if agreements could have been 
signed on this occasion and if [Economics] Minister Ducky had 
also taken part in the visit, particularly because the Polish 
side expected it. In spite of this, I think that this changed 
nothing regarding the overall results of the visit, taking into 
consideration what can generally be expected from a presidential 
visit. 
  [Michalcik] The affair concerning Milan Panic's letter 
started in Bratislava on the day you left [25 January]. Do you 
think the choice of date was deliberate? 
  [Kovac] I cannot say anything for certain. I only know that 
the letter was dispatched from the Presidential Office to the 
Office of the Government on 17 or 18 January and that it was 
lying there for quite a long time. This means that there was an 
opportunity to react to it in some way by 19 or 20 January. I 
cannot say whether the prime minister received the letter from 
his clerks only later, or whether something else happened. In 
any case, as regards this visit, the date it was made public was 
not well chosen. 
  [Michalcik] During your talks with Polish President Walesa 
and other officials, a number of interesting proposals and 
projects emerged--namely, a total opening of our borders and a 
systematic dialogue within the Partnership for Peace project. 
Speaking at a news conference, you said that this is no longer 
just a shared wish but an inevitable course of action brought 
about by circumstances. [passage omitted] 
  [Kovak] We have come to realize that our nations are very 
close to each other, we are neighbors sharing a border almost 
600 km in length, and we have the same problems, common 
interests, and internal and foreign policies. Therefore, it 
would be very irresponsible not to make use of this chance. 
  This conclusion has been reached not only on the level of 
presidents but, in my view, also on the level of the Polish 
Government as well as the Sejm and Senate. Therefore, I feel 
entitled to expect that the next meeting between the [Slovak and 
Polish] prime ministers, perhaps also between the Polish and 
Slovak Cabinets, will really mean a significant turning point, 
because at these meetings issues will be specified and a number 
of agreements prepared for signing. We are fully aware of the 
fact that, without a proper basis formed by agreements, it is 
not really possible at present to develop our relations on 
various levels. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Vladimirovich Yastrzhembskiy, Russian </F>
ambassador to the Slovak Republic, by Stefan Sugar; place and 
date not given: "Democracy Will Not Be a Springboard for 
Zhirinovskiy"] 
  [Text] [Sugar] Mr. Ambassador, the visit by U.S. 
President Bill Clinton to Brussels, Prague, and Moscow had a 
dramatic prelude in the diplomatic war that Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin provoked with his letter to the governments of 
Western states. He indicated in it that the rapid admission of 
the Visegrad Four states into NATO could have unfortunate 
repercussions for the fate of democracy in Russia. From this 
point of view, what is your assessment of President Clinton's 
visit to Moscow and the Partnership for Peace plan? 
  [Yastrzhembskiy] I would like to turn first to President 
Yeltsin's letter, from which it is obvious that we are not 
opposed to individual countries choosing their allies according 
to their own way of thinking or to their joining 
military-political organizations. We wanted to make sure, 
however, that the interests of Russia are also taken into 
consideration in any measures to guarantee peace and security in 
Europe. In my opinion, the rapid admission of the Visegrad Four 
countries into NATO would mean a new division of Europe, whose 
lines would be drawn on the borders of the former Soviet Union. 
Therefore, we have proposed that security in Europe be 
discussed with the Russian Federation, and the course of 
President Clinton's visit to Brussels, Prague, and Moscow shows 
that the West has taken our point of view into consideration. 
The outcome of this is the Partnership for Peace plan, which, 
in many respects, is identical to our views. We rate the visit 
to Moscow by President Clinton very positively, and we see it as 
a heartfelt sign of the solidarity of Washington and the U.S. 
President with Russia. We think that the decision made by NATO 
in Brussels is sensible and realistic because it respects both 
the interests of NATO and those of the postcommunist countries 
in East Europe and the Russian Federation. 
  [Sugar] The Atlantic Alliance was established after World 
War II as a defense against the penetration of communism into 
Western Europe. This danger has passed because the Soviet Union 
has collapsed, and its ideology has been discredited. Where 
does Russia see the mission and purpose of NATO in today's 
postcommunist Europe? 
  [Yastrzhembskiy] This is an apt question. The former 
military and ideological adversary of the West, organized within 
the Warsaw Pact, has indeed disintegrated, and the question now 
is with and against whom NATO intends to devise Europe's 
security. 
  We consider NATO to be an important partner, and we support 
all of its measures to bolster peace in Europe. NATO is still 
needed in Europe because a new threat to peace has arisen. The 
war in Yugoslavia is the most tragic example of where aggressive 
nationalism--which is rearing its head in many European 
countries, including the states of the former Soviet Union--can 
lead. In some countries this aggressive nationalism is even 
beginning to manifest itself in military actions, and that is a 
challenge worthy of NATO. 
  The second question is, with whom. Partnership for Peace 
answers it because it expands the sphere of partnership not only 
to the members of the Visegrad Four but also to the other 
countries of the former socialist bloc. It is in the common 
interest of all of us to ensure that the transformation of 
postcommunist Europe proceeds calmly and in peace by civilized 
means without bloodletting and tense relations. 
  [Sugar] This is true, but on both sides there is a certain 
mistrust founded in historical experiences. The Visegrad Four 
countries are concerned that democratic developments in Russia 
may spin out of control, and, therefore, they want to join NATO 
quickly. On the other hand, the idea that NATO military 
structures would be on the borders of the former Soviet Union is 
unacceptable to the Russian Federation. What is Russia afraid 
of? Of future developments in Germany, perhaps, against which 
Margaret Thatcher is also warning? 
  [Yastrzhembskiy] As far as Germany is concerned, it is 
forgotten that NATO was also established to guarantee democratic 
developments in the former Nazi Germany and to prevent any 
return by Germany to its aggressive past. It seems to me that, 
in this concert of states, the German voice is a democratic one. 
Today's Germany is completely new and is one of democratic 
Russia's closest partners. Of course, in Germany--and in other 
countries--there are also extremist forces that make themselves 
known from time to time. Today's Germany, however, very sensibly 
nips these manifestations in the bud. 
  [Sugar] What danger did President Yeltsin have in mind when 
he recommended in his letter that the Visegrad Four states not 
be admitted into NATO? 
  [Yastrzhembskiy] We have already discussed this issue 
several times with our Slovak colleagues. The democratic 
leadership and a certain part of Russian society do not consider 
NATO to be their adversary. In politics, however, we have to 
take into consideration the psychology of the whole of society 
and the intellectual orientation of the army. Namely, we cannot 
claim that Russian society is united in its assessment of NATO. 
A certain part of society would view the presence of NATO 
military structures on the borders of the former Soviet Union as 
a threat to Russia's national interests, and the postcommunist 
forces would immediately use this course of action by NATO 
toward the East to unleash a campaign against Russia's 
democratic leadership and to discredit it. Under the current 
conditions, pushing NATO's borders toward the East would, 
objectively speaking, be directed against the interests of 
democracy in Russia because this would place President Yeltsin 
and his colleagues in a very delicate situation. The decision 
made by NATO in Brussels has sent us a signal that it accepts 
the interests of democratic Russia and that Europe's security 
cannot be resolved at variance with Russia's interests. 
  [Sugar] Concern about further democratic development in 
Russia is aroused in particular by Zhirinovskiy's statements 
about Russia's aspirations for power and about the new division 
of the world. Zhirinovskiy is reminiscent only of Adolf Hitler 
in his tactlessness. Some Russian politicians make light of the 
Zhirinovskiy phenomenon, but Hitler was also just a figure of 
fun at the beginning. On what wave is Zhirinovskiy riding? 
  [Yastrzhembskiy] We could devote the entire interview to 
this man because a whole series of issues is associated with 
him. It seems that several factors played into Zhirinovskiy's 
hands in the elections. For example, the factor of national 
humiliation. The collapse of the Warsaw Pact, the withdrawal of 
Soviet troops from East Europe, the disintegration of the Soviet 
Union, and the apparent decline--temporarily, I am convinced--of 
Russia's political importance in the world have all had a very 
painful effect on the self-confidence of the Russian people. 
The mood was just as depressing in the Weimar Republic 
following the acceptance of the Treaty of Versailles. 
Zhirinovskiy is using this mood to propagate an 
ultranationalistic and ultrapatriotic program. 
  Zhirinovskiy is also making use of the cruel aftermath of 
the 
shock treatment on the population's standard of living and is 
scoring points with his very simple recipes for dealing with 
problems. If we take a closer look, we can easily convince 
ourselves that this is demagoguery, but, during elections, 
citizens do not normally seek reality in election promises. For 
example, Zhirinovskiy declares that he would resolve the crime 
problem in three months. This really is just demagoguery 
because the crime rate is associated with the overall economic 
decline, and there are no miraculous solutions. After 70 years 
of the Soviet Union, our people have learned to believe in fairy 
tales, and they also believed Zhirinovskiy and his fairy tales 
about painless solutions to problems. He concealed the fact 
that the situation is really grave and complicated and that the 
government, if it wants to improve the situation, has to adopt 
unpopular measures. There is no other way. 
  [Sugar] In the democratic elections, Russia adopted a 
constitution that executes the so-called presidential principle 
of government. However, isn't this system just a trap for 
democracy? What if Zhirinovskiy wins the next presidential 
election? 
  [Yastrzhembskiy] In the situation in which Russian society 
finds itself, the best solution is, in my opinion, a 
presidential republic. Incidentally, strong executive power is 
a tradition in Russia, and it would be impossible to push for 
economic reforms and systemic changes in Russia without it. By 
the way, perhaps unity and internal stability are also best 
guaranteed by strong presidential--but democratic--power. 
Perhaps there will be a new constitution in Russia when the 
reforms make progress and democracy is bolstered. However, if 
it were to turn out that this presidential constitution could be 
a springboard for Zhirinovskiy, it would be in our common 
interest to prevent this. 
  [Sugar] Russian politicians say that, following the 
elections, the social interests of the population will also be 
taken into consideration in the economic reforms. Can we also 
interpret this, in a certain way, as a kind of self-criticism on 
the part of the initiators of the shock treatment? 
  [Yastrzhembskiy] I think that the strategic course of the 
Gaydar government's reforms was correct. Its failing was, 
however, that it did not devote enough attention to the social 
aspects of reform and that it also forgot to provide information 
on the economic policy. Macroeconomic schemes are quite 
incomprehensible to ordinary people, and, therefore, it was 
necessary to present them in ordinary language so they could be 
understood. The election results also revealed that, in a 
country like Russia, with the social habits of its population, 
the shock treatment should have been accompanied by stronger 
social assistance for the socially most dependent sectors of the 
population. The new government will do more as far as social 
policy is concerned. 
  [Sugar] I would like to return to what you said about the 
aggressive nationalism that, as in the case of Yugoslavia, fans 
conflagrations on other territories by means of its ethnic 
minorities. The Russian Federation also faces this danger 
because there are strong groups of Russian inhabitants in many 
of the former Soviet republics. What will Moscow's policy be in 
this sphere? 
  [Yastrzhembskiy] We will strive to ensure that the 
Russian-speaking population feels like an organic element of the 
state in which it lives and not an autonomous element. We are 
not advocating any special collective rights for them. We are 
asking, first and foremost, for individual civil rights that 
correspond to the world standard. We are interested in ensuring 
that these people continue to live where they were born, where 
they work, and where they gain recognition for helping the state 
to prosper through their work. 
  [Sugar] When the Slovak prime minister or minister of 
national defense visit Moscow, some of the mass media begin to 
sound the alarm that Slovakia has ulterior motives and that it 
obviously does not belong to the camp of democratic countries. 
However, when the Hungarian prime minister or minister of 
national defense visits Moscow, the aforementioned mass media 
keeps quiet about this. Tell us, Mr. Ambassador, is there 
something dangerous for other countries behind good 
Russian-Slovak relations? 
  [Yastrzhembskiy] If there are good relations between the 
governments of two countries, this will begin to alarm certain 
people and even arouse some jealousy. This jealousy has various 
motives and various aims. As far as the relations between 
Russia and Slovakia are concerned, I admit that we harbor warm 
friendly feelings toward Slovakia and that, in our relations 
with Slovakia and its young state, we are also following up on 
the cultural and spiritual ties that reach deep into the past. 
I will make no secret of the fact that, with regard to our 
current strategic interests, cooperation between Slovakia and 
Russia has great prospects, first and foremost, in the technical 
and economic spheres. We all know that a major part of Slovak 
output was oriented toward the Soviet market and, whether people 
like it or not, it is therefore in Slovakia's interest to make 
use of this orientation. This does not mean that Slovakia 
should forge good relations only with democratic Russia. There 
is a proverb: In order to fly, a man would need two wings. 
Therefore, I think that good relations between Slovakia and the 
East and Slovakia and the West would best suit Slovakia's 
national interests. Let me reiterate: The Russian market is 
very promising for Slovakia and, on the other hand, it is very 
important for us to have Slovakia as an economic partner. 
  [Sugar] Thank you for the interview.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ivan Horsky: "Blow Below the Belt"] </F>
  [Text] President Michal Kovac departed yesterday for 
neighboring Poland, for what is his first state visit abroad 
this year. As is well known, he had met his host, President 
Lech Walesa, at the recent summit of the Visegrad Four heads of 
state with the U.S. President, where the two presidents agreed 
that the present visit should become a landmark in relations 
between the two countries. 
  I will not betray any state secret when I say there is an 
outright deficit in the two countries' knowledge of one another 
and, in particular, in the development of economic and 
commercial contacts, which have registered a rapid decrease in 
recent years. Therefore, it was to be expected that precisely 
these topics would figure uppermost on the agenda of the talks 
in Warsaw. 
  But, wonder of wonders, neither the minister of economy nor 
the minister of foreign affairs is in the delegation 
accompanying the Slovak president. The minister of the 
environment is the only government member who was given the 
green light [to accompany the president]. I am not suggesting 
that cooperation in this unquestionably important area need not 
be discussed. The crux of the matter seems to lie in something 
else, however. Somebody is doing everything he can for the head 
of state not to grow taller than he is and for the head of state 
not to be able to ascribe to himself the credit for something 
that, in the view of the latter, somehow does not belong to him. 
  This already open hostility endangers the vital interests of 
our state because it can be expected that such behavior will not 
go unnoticed by the other side and will boomerang against us 
and, apparently, will be repaid with interest. 
  Because the chiefs of government departments who could give 
an impetus to Slovak-Polish relations were not allowed to go to 
Warsaw, it must be assumed that the government had far more 
important problems to deal with at its meeting yesterday.

  [Text] Dunajska Streda--Yesterday's District Assembly of 
the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] in Dunajska Streda 
was attended by HZDS Chairman and Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar. 
  In his opening statement, he pointed out that current HZDS 
district assemblies confirm that the movement is gathering new 
strength and that any opposition pressures are in vain because 
the ruling movement is fulfilling, and will fulfill, its 
electoral program. He noted that, in conformity with the 
Constitution of the Slovak Republic, the movement is trying to 
address ethnic issues so that everyone's freedom and the 
equality of all citizens regardless of nationality be 
guaranteed. No one is a second-class citizen in our country, the 
prime minister stressed. If someone suffers from the internal 
complex of being a second-class citizen, let him undergo 
treatment and not go public with it. 
  Relations among citizens in the south of Slovakia are not 
complicated, but the problems are being exaggerated by Central 
European bodies and also by some circles from Hungary. Our 
borders are unchangeable, and each political party at home as 
well as abroad must realize this, Vladimir Meciar said, among 
other things.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 26 Jan (TANJUG) -- "The French initiative 
is rather vague to us. We cannot tell whether it calls for the 
political or military presence of the United States," Srpska 
republic president Radovan Karadzic told Serb Television, 
Sarajevo Studio, this evening. 
  "We are in no way opposed to a more active U.S. and Russian 
involvement in the political resolution of the crisis," Karadzic 
added. 
  Speaking about the Russian initiative, Karadzic assessed 
that 
it conforms with what has been envisaged -- that such a document 
should be made public after agreement is reached between the 
three [Bosnian] sides. "I believe that it is good to insist on 
this conference under the auspices of the European Union and we 
are not against the possible engagement of the UN Security 
Council, the United States, and Russia," Karadzic said. 
  "However, it seems to me that the international community 
should find ways to force the Muslim leadership into accepting 
peace because it is obviously a problem for them to accept 
anything. This current Muslim political team cannot bring the 
war to an end because it is incapable of leading its own people 
to peace and giving it a state of its own. They are leading the 
Muslim people to their doom," Karadzic stressed. 
  Commenting on U.S. President Clinton's statement that nobody 
should be forced to accept solutions unacceptable to them, the 
Srpska republic president said he welcomes such a stance 
because, in his view, outside pressure cannot effect a solution 
in Bosnia. 
  "What we are insisting on is that the United States and part 
of the international community begin treating all three sides in 
the conflict equally, which means that the sanctions should be 
lifted immediately. I must say that the Muslims have, 
unfortunately, opted for war, and our people must now close 
ranks even more and prepare to defend our state. This will 
require great efforts on our part, but the Muslim leadership 
must be aware that we will be well prepared for war if it does 
break out," Karadzic underlined. 
  Alija Izetbegovic's refusal to accept the Russian initiative 
was assessed by Karadzic as yet another move aimed at 
undermining everything that leads to peace. 
  "The Muslim leaders' deranged hopes that they will conquer 
all of Bosnia-Herzegovina represent a disaster for the Muslim 
people. They could not defeat us even when they were allied 
with the Croats. We and the Croats have opted for peace -- a 
position that leaves the Muslim military option without a ghost 
of a chance," Radovan Karadzic said.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 27 Jan (TANJUG)--Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the republic of Srpska, has sent a letter to UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, in which he points to 
facts showing that the Muslims in Bosnia are not interested in 
establishing peace. 
  "Muslim Army Commander Rasim Delic reiterated threats 
against 
the Serb side on 25 January, while Muslim Prime Minister Haris 
Silajdzic spoke of the concept of continuing the war in the 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina on 26 January", Karadzic said in his 
letter to Butrus-Ghali. "At the same time, Alija Izetbegovic is 
visiting Muslim countries and is asking for their help, which 
makes us believe that--despite their pretense that they want to 
negotiate--the Muslims really never gave up their aspiration for 
the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina", Karadzic stresses. According 
to Karadzic, this aspiration is "in conflict with the interests 
of the Serbian and Croatian people in Bosnia." 
  Recalling that the Serbs and the Croats signed an agreement 
on the exchange of official representatives during the last 
round of Geneva negotiations in order to resolve the 
disagreements through political means, Karadzic notes that the 
Muslims were also asked to sign a similar agreement, but did not 
respond. "Muslim demands regarding territorial borders in 
eastern and western Bosnia, which caused the breakup of the 
negotiating process, rendered futile the cochairmen's attempts 
to achieve a result in the peace process that would satisfy all 
three sides in the conflict". 
  In his warning to Butrus-Ghali that Izetbegovic's strategic 
objective is to halt the peace process, Karadzic notes that 
Izetbegovic was essentially trying to buy time for importing 
weapons and strengthening the military option. 
  "Tuzla airport is intended to be used for arms smuggling, 
which would cause new incidents, for which--as usual--the Serbs 
would be blamed", Karadzic warns and points out that the problem 
of humanitarian aid deliveries can be resolved by widening the 
land corridor to Tuzla. "Although humanitarian deliveries would 
double this way, Muslim authorities still insist on opening 
Tuzla airport in an attempt to create a crisis spot", Karadzic 
says, and adds that the "problem" of replacing UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] troops in Srebrenica has also proven to be 
another Muslim insinuation. "This, however, does not decrease 
the possibility of air strikes against the Serbs, despite the 
fact that such an act could be catastrophic and could cause 
far-reaching complications". 
  Karadzic goes on to say: "If we are attacked, we will 
exercise our legitimate right to self-defense, in which we will 
use all available forces". 
  "Now that Muslim intolerance is the only obstacle to peace, 
I 
cannot understand why the international community should discuss 
such an absurd step for achieving absurd objectives," Karadzic 
says. He adds that the Serbs have fought simply to be able to 
live on the land they had succeeded in preserving through six 
centuries of despotism under the Turkish and Austro-Hungarian 
empires. "We shall fight for another six centuries if need be, 
but we can have peace as early as tomorrow, provided the rights 
of each side are respected", Karadzic says to Ghali. 
  In the conclusion of his letter the president of the Serb 
Republic calls on the UN secretary general to do his utmost to 
encourage U.S. diplomacy to clearly underline to the Muslim 
government in Sarajevo the advantage of peace and the dangers of 
continuing the war.

  [Text] The Bosnia-Herzegovina Government held a session 
today that addressed the privatization of the social property. 
The government believes that the identification of all social 
property should be carried out with the aim of its 
privatization. At the end of the open part of the session, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic informed all 
present that there are indications that major Croatian Army 
forces are concentrated on the Bosnia-Herzegovina territory, 
around Prozor, to be precise. He proposed that the government 
requests additional information about the presence of the 
Croatian Armed Forces on Bosnia-Herzegovina soil to facilitate a 
decision about further measures, that is to say, that the 
government could decide in the course of tomorrow whether to 
demand an urgent session of the UN Security Council.

  [Text] Concerning the Russian initiative for a session of 
the Security Council in Geneva dedicated to the solution to the 
conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Dr. Ejup Ganic, member of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, stressed for B-H PRESS five 
factors that were interlinked with this proposal. 
  The statements by the UN generals that have served in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina clearly express that the UN Administration 
has done nothing in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It has not observed a 
single UN resolution, and has brought its mission into an 
extremely unenviable position. Our argument that the partition 
of Bosnia, as preached by Lord Owen, forces over 1 million 
people off their property -- therefore they lose their entire 
private property -- has caused much confusion in the West [words 
indistinct] based on private property. The question arises what 
kind of a partition is it that takes rights from the people, Dr. 
Ganic explained. 
  The Bosnia-Herzegovina attitude is to negotiate only if 
there 
are clear political principles. They were set out at the London 
Conference but have in the meantime been abandoned. In order to 
reach a solution those principles have to be implemented. A new 
international conference -- not a European one, as Europe has 
proven itself impotent and ineffective -- would involve the 
problem of the entire region by defining principles and a moral 
code of conduct. 
  With the announcement of the withdrawal of some Western 
troops from Bosnia-Herzegovina, one has to take into account the 
readiness of Turkey and some other countries to send in their 
troops. That does not suit those who want to partition Bosnia, 
Ganic believes. These factors initiated the Russian proposal, 
which suits the Serbian aggressor. The Russians know that they 
can have the majority when it comes to the partition of Bosnia, 
and want thus to force the United Sates to accept that 
partition. The aim is to drag the United States into such a 
job. Everything speaks in favor of things returning to the 
beginning, although that is what the Russians do not want, 
Presidency member Ejup Ganic said. 
  Our Assembly has never accepted the partition of Bosnia, but 
(?internal demarcation is possible). However, every citizen 
must have the right to his property and the right to participate 
in political decisionmaking. An attempt is being made to thwart 
the strengthening of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army by an 
unfavorable solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina. The drop in the 
motivation of the Serb army and the drop in the living standards 
in Serbia does not suit those who want to achieve their greater 
state ambitions in this region. We are for peace, for a 
cease-fire, and for a just solution, Ganic stressed in a 
statement for B-H PRESS.

  [Text] Ever since 28 September last year, when the 
constituent assembly, chaired by Fikret Abdic, declared in 
Velika Kladusa the autonomous province of west Bosnia, making it 
a separate administrative unit within the union of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the assessments and statements of support or 
denial of the act have not ceased. As is known, the first to 
oppose the declaration was the SDA [Party of Democratic Action] 
of Bihac, then Alija Izetbegovic, president of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, declared the act 
unconstitutional, and finally asked the 5th Corps of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army to put an end, by military means, to 
what in his opinion was a short episode of his political 
opponent, with whom he separated soon after the SDA won the 
elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Fikret Abdic replied with the 
proclamation in which he invited "all the citizens, especially 
the fighters, to defend the people, freedom, democracy, and 
human dignity with weapons and other means." The national 
defense of west Bosnia was founded, and it prevented the 5th 
Corps from controlling the entire territory. The present 
demarcation line between Izetbegovic's and Abdic's army is 
somewhere between Cazin and Velika Kladusa. 
  Croatian president Tudjman supported Abdic's idea of 
autonomy; shortly after Abdic concluded another agreement with 
Radovan Karadzic concerning free trade in the Serb-controlled 
territory, trucks loaded with goods and buses carrying 
passengers started taking the road connecting Kladusa and 
Karlovac. The reporters in the area say that the prices are 
indeed high, but that there are no shortages. There is Franck 
coffee [Croatian] as well as Pancevo beer. Abdic trades with 
everyone and he makes no secret of it. On the contrary, he 
often points out that this form of cooperation with the 
neighbors who were at one time his war enemies is the only way 
to survive. The cochairmen of the peace conference on the 
former Yugoslavia, Owen and Stoltenberg, also acknowledged his 
project by inviting him to participate in the talks and by 
giving a positive assessment of his political initiative. 
According to his own statement, Abdic's basis for establishing 
autonomy comes from the Geneva peace package for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, according to which this state is to be 
organized on the basis of constituent units. The authorities in 
the province were established through autonomous acts and laws, 
the purpose of which is "to secure constitutionality and rule of 
law, human rights and freedom, market economy, and the equality 
of all peoples, cultures, and religions." 
<H5>  The Muslim Island </H5>
  According to the 1991 census, 245,435 people lived on the 
territory of the autonomous province of west Bosnia (Bihac, 
Cazin, Velika Kladusa, and Bosanska Krupa, which is now partly 
under the control of the Bosnian Serbs). Muslims were 80.05 
percent of that figure, 13 percent were Serbs, 3 percent Croats, 
and the remaining 3 percent others. The territory covers a 
little less than 2,500 square kilometers. The Zagreb-Split 
railroad passes through Bihac, being the only connection between 
northern Croatia and Dalmatia; there is also an important road 
connecting Banja Luka with Knin and Split, and the road 
connecting western Herzegovina with Zagreb. The most important 
road for the province is the Bihac-Cazin-Velika Kladusa-Karlovac 
road, continuing toward Rijeka or Zagreb. If this road is not 
open, West Bosnia cannot exist, because the road is also the 
connection with the sea, where, as geopolitician Topalovic says, 
it exercises its transit rights in the free zone of the port of 
Rijeka, rather than its territorial achievements. 
  The autonomous province of west Bosnia is, by its 
geopolitical position, a Muslim island, which is, in the east, 
separated by Karadzic's state from Travnik by over a hundred 
kilometers. Travnik is controlled by Izetbegovic's 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. There are, therefore, no possibilities 
of creating a corridor by the assumed war operations that would 
connect these two distant territories. In peace time, Bihac and 
Kladusa had more connections with Zagreb than with Sarajevo. 
Businessmen say that the province, due to its natural 
orientation toward Karlovac, Rijeka, and Zagreb, was in fact 
part of the Croatian economic territory. Therefore, at the east 
of the province are the Bosnian Serbs, while its other three 
sides have, from the Serbian aggression against Croatia, been 
controlled by the Croatian Serbs. The international community 
calls the territory of the "Krajina" parastate the "Croatian 
UNPA's" (north and south). If, according to the Vance plan, 
which is a supplement to the Security Council resolutions, the 
UNPA's are reintegrated in the Croatian constitutional and legal 
system, then the Glina district would be in the north of west 
Bosnia, the Knin district in the south, and the territory of the 
municipality of Slunj, which, until the occupation, had a Croat 
majority, would bear on the province from the west. According 
to geopolitician Topalovic, the main points of support that 
permit control of the Autonomous Province of West Bosnia are 
mountains: Petrova Gora (Kordun), Zrinska Gora (Banija), Grmec 
(Bosanska Krajina), and Pljesivica (Lika). All these mountains 
are controlled by the Serbs, and there is no realistic support 
for the claim that the Muslim forces from West Bosnia would have 
any success in a war conflict with the Serbs. Thanks to the 
military aid that arrived in these territories through Croatia, 
the Muslims managed to defend themselves -- with more or less 
success (they lost Prijedor, Sanski Most, and parts of Bosanska 
Krupa) -- probably because the Serbs were satisfied with the 
territories they had occupied. According to military estimates, 
the Muslims from west Bosnia have no chance of retrieving the 
lost territory by military means -- because they are isolated 
and because of the balance of power. 
<H5>  The Agreement With the Croats and the Serbs </H5>
  As opposed to Izetbegovic, who, despite the circumstances, 
forces the Muslim conflict with the Serbs, who completely 
surround them, Abdic seeks a different solution. Realizing that 
he is the inferior party, and that, without free roads, his 
enclave would be doomed to a quiet death, while wanting to keep 
the people and the territory under his rule, Abdic offered 
agreements to the Serbs and Croats on the principle of "I give 
to you, you give to me". He offered the Serbs transit through 
the railroad to Knin in return for the passage through the road 
to Karlovac, and the Croats the transit expenses for the free 
zone in the port of Rijeka. Abdic has already announced the 
consequence of such agreements: "The future west Bosnia will be 
a free customs country with the stable economic support of the 
great Croatian port of Rijeka, which is to function as a free 
customs zone." Zlatko Jusic, prime minister of the autonomous 
province of west Bosnia, tried to clarify this statement during 
a short talk in Zagreb: "The free customs zone would be 
introduced for a period of two years. What we do not have would 
arrive in the province under favorable conditions, and what we 
do have would be easier to transport abroad. Consequently, we 
would not be isolated, our people would not leave, and an 
economic environment favorable to development would thus be 
created. As soon as conditions allowed, we would carry out the 
privatization of ownership; we would do it even through decrees, 
since we see that the democratic system slows down the process. 
We are aware that the finishing of the process, with the free 
transit of people and goods, is the precondition for our joining 
Western, that is, the European civilization. This is our goal, 
and we will not give up on it." 
  The differences between the two concepts of organizing West 
Bosnia are now clearer. Izetbegovic's consists of a long-term 
war and the population surviving thanks to humanitarian aid and 
hoping for international military intervention, which creates 
favorable conditions for religious extremism, while Abdic, aware 
of the circumstances, is trying to preserve the people through 
negotiations and provide not only an existence for them, but 
also a living in accordance with the European standards. 
<H5>  Whom Does West Bosnia Belong To? </H5>
  Looking at Croatian history, one can see that the diplomacy 
of the Republic of Dubrovnik made moves similar to Abdic's. 
This little oasis of Croatian statehood was for centuries 
building its prosperity by negotiating rather than employing its 
military forces against its powerful neighbors (Venice, 
Turkey....). Naturally, it paid for its freedom, but it in turn 
earned the money from those it gave money to, since every 
Dubrovnik contract included a clause stating that the Dubrovnik 
tradesmen had free passage through a certain empire or kingdom 
(naturally, a comparison with Apolonije's recent attempt at 
founding a Dubrovnik republic would not be valid, since 
Dubrovnik is connected to Croatia by continuous territory, and 
because a separate Croatian state did not exist at the time of 
the founding of the Republic of Dubrovnik). 
  However, Abdic is in an even worse position than the people 
of Dubrovnik, as they at least had an open passage into the 
world through the sea, while his West Bosnia is completely 
surrounded. His policy therefore has no alternative if there is 
a desire to preserve the people and the territory. If there is 
the desire to be the victim, all it takes is to yield to the 
myths of the past and to unrealistic ambitions. Everything will 
be over very soon. "Izetbegovic is still trying to make the 
Cazin Krajina a mass grave of the Muslim people, as he has done 
in other parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina," said Abdic, aware of what 
disaster this policy would lead to. However, it seems that this 
policy cannot come about in West Bosnia. That is, it is almost 
completely unimportant who is going to win in the inter-Muslim 
conflict in West Bosnia. If Abdic wins, he will carry out his 
planned policy of alliance, and should by any chance 
Izetbegovic's forces win, they will also have to carry out 
Abdic's policies if they want the people and the territory to 
survive. 
  Through history, this province had leaders who easily 
changed 
military uniforms and allies, keeping in mind only the existence 
of the enclave. This is what Huska Miljkovic, the leader of the 
Muslim militia of the time, did during World War II. For a 
while he was an Ustasha, and the next moment he was a partisan. 
However, he preserved the people. This spirit of an autonomous 
enclave is at the same time the message to those who believe 
that the autonomous province of west Bosnia will take either the 
Serbian or the Croatian side. It will take the side of whoever 
is at its borders, unable to change its neighbor, but, weaker in 
military terms, capable of making a bearable ally out of them. 
However, in doing so, it will always remain its own, as it has 
for the past several centuries. Therefore, the thesis offered 
the Croats -- "central Bosnia for western Bosnia" -- is nothing 
but an unfounded evocation of something that will never happen.
