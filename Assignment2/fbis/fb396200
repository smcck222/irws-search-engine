  [Text] Caracas, 20 Jan (AFP) -- Student revolts continued 
on Thursday and spread in the afternoon to Maturin, 400 km east 
of Caracas, where there were marches and clashes with police, 
according to reporters on the scene. 
  This morning, there was violence in the small city of 
Ocumare 
del Tuy, 70 km to the south, and Villa de Cura, 100 km to the 
west. Last night there were riots in the streets of Caracas. 
There also were riots in the industrial city of Valencia, which 
is 80 km to the west of Caracas; in the twin cities of Barcelona 
and Puerto La Cruz, 220 km to the east; and in Punto Fijo, 368 
km to the northwest. Vehicles were set on fire in these cities, 
and there was looting in some cities in the interior. In 
Barcelona, an 85-year-old woman was shot dead, six people were 
injured, three stores were looted, and one grocery distribution 
truck was robbed. 
  Calm was restored in Barcelona and Maturin on Thursday, but 
the regional authorities ordered that both cities be placed 
under military control. Army troops and militarized national 
guardsmen were posted in the streets. In Punto Fijo, some 20 
stores were looted, other shops were attacked with stones, and 
there was general panic. 
  The disturbances began last week over a hike in 
transportation rates and a sales tax that was suspended, which 
ultimately led to speculation that prices would rise by as much 
as 300 percent. The riots first started in Barcelona and Puerto 
la Cruz, and from there they spread on Tuesday to Cumana and 
Maturin.

  [Text] Barcelona (Venezuela), 20 Jan (DPA) -- Following a 
wave of disturbances over the past few days by demonstrators 
protesting the value-added tax (VAT) and public transportation 
fare increases in Barcelona and Puerto la Cruz, both cities -- 
located about 320 km east of Caracas -- today were practically 
"seized" by military troops. 
  The measure to mobilize an undetermined number of soldiers 
was adopted this morning by the military garrison in Anzoategui 
State, following the governor's request this morning to Garrison 
Commander Miguel Aparicio Ramirez. 
  Police had been literally "run over" the past few days by 
angry mobs and had been unable to prevent vandalism, which left 
many supermarkets looted and several vehicles ablaze. Up until 
now the authorities have not disclosed whether any arrests have 
been made. 
  Violence unleashed by a group calling itself "Red Flag" 
[bureau records show this organization was founded in 1970 by 
Carlos Betancourt] had paralyzed activities in Barcelona, 
capital of Anzoategui State, for about a week. Disturbances 
also reached the nearby beach resort of Puerto la Cruz. 
  Even though both Barcelona and Puerto la Cruz woke up in 
complete calm today, it was a tense calm because of the presence 
of National Guardsmen patrolling the streets. 
  Meanwhile, transportation services, which had been 
temporarily suspended, have been totally reestablished, allowing 
students and workers to meet their obligations, the local 
VENPRES wire service reported. Likewise, many businessmen 
opened their stores. 
  Anzoategui Governor Ovidio Gonzalez gave assurances that the 
situation had been normalized in the northern part of the state, 
even though he would not admit that Barcelona and Puerto la Cruz 
are "militarized." He said that street patrols by the Armed 
Forces represent "a routine situation when there is violence."

  [Text] Concerning the disturbances that have been taking 
place in various educational institutions throughout the 
country, Interior Relations Minister Carlos Delgado Chapellin 
reiterated that these incidents are being caused by small groups 
of troublemakers. He added that these groups include suspected 
extremists who are being investigated. 
  [Begin recording] [Chapellin] I believe that this would seem 
to be a political tactic that will lead nowhere. Some high 
school students are being manipulated. They are students who 
are being misled [words indistinct] by people who have nothing 
to do with the educational sector. These disturbances have no 
popular support, and the best thing the students can do is to go 
home and study and allow the elected president to be sworn-in 
peacefully. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Minister, by whom are they being manipulated? 
  [Chapellin] Manipulated by forces associated with the 
so-called extremists. We are currently investigating several 
extremists. There might be some surprises in terms of who is 
manipulating these squalid protest marches. Do not blow these 
disturbances out of proportion because they are worthless. 
  [Reporter] Will the authorities ever uncover who... 
  [Chapellin, interrupting] Of course we will. Just yesterday 
[words indistinct] four masked men. The university authorities 
were the first to [word indistinct]. Let us give... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] Yes, but the uncertainty caused by 
these same four people... 
  [Chapellin] Well, we will have to arrest those four people, 
even if they decide to hide on university grounds. [end

Marianella Rodriguez] 
  [Text] Maracay (Special) -- Hooded individuals plundered 
and burned a Marlow and Savoy company truck loaded with candies 
and chocolates at approximately 1530 outside the El Limon branch 
of the Central University of Venezuela (UCV). 
  The vehicle, a Ford 350 with license plates 036-GAL, was 
traveling down Maracay-El Limon Avenue when it was intercepted 
in front of the veterinary school in Cana de Azucar neighborhood 
by a group of hooded individuals, who also robbed the driver. 
  In addition, a demonstration was held between 0800 and 1200 
on 20 January in Cana de Azucar neighborhood in front of the 
governor's office to protest the high cost of living, the 
increase in power rates, the excessive increase of bus fares, 
and the value-added tax (VAT). 
  Uneventful protests were also staged in Villa de Cura and La 
Victoria, while professors from high schools in Cagua, Villa de 
Cura, and Turmero demanded payment of their salaries. 
  In Valencia, groups of students and hooded individuals on 20 
January hijacked 30 buses on various urban routes as well as 
routes outside this capital. The vehicles were taken to the 
parking lot at the University of Carabobo's school of education, 
where they remained until that evening. 
  According to several students at the scene, the bus seizures 
were prompted by an inconsiderate increase in bus fares. The 
students added that they would not cease their activities until 
their demands were heard. 
  Edgar Barbera, representative of the Valencia Collective 
Transportation Union, said the union will not allow any 
collective transportation to circulate in the city until the 
buses are returned. 
  At approximately 1700, the end of the workday, on 20 
January, 
Valencia bus stops and streets were crowded with people who were 
forced to walk home. 
  In Maturin and Caripito, students held violent 
demonstrations 
on 21 January to protest increased bus fares and the collection 
of half fares in the midst of demonstrations that affected local 
businesses and required the intervention of police riot brigades. 
  High school students hijacked several microbuses and parked 
them near the state government building, which was occupied by 
the police on the morning of 20 January. 
  In Caripito, hotheaded students from the Technological 
Institute staged their second consecutive day of violent 
demonstrations, causing considerable damage to city hall and the 
Socialist League building.

  [Text] Calm is returning to the cities of Puerto La Cruz 
and Barcelona after four days of public demonstrations. As 
Barcelona and Puerto La Cruz are slowly returning to normalcy, 
the police have announced the arrest of scores of people 
involved in neighborhood riots. The National Guard has 
implemented continuous patrols in Barcelona and Puerto La Cruz 
neighborhoods to prevent any outbreak of violence. 
  General Miguel Aparicio Ramirez, commander of the Anzoategui 
State military force, has said that the riots were economically 
motivated and that they took place to protest the implementation 
of the value-added tax and the increase in public bus fares. He 
urged the population to remain calm and not to take any action 
against private or public property, because people involved in 
such actions will be prosecuted under the Vagrancy and Hoodlum 
Law. 
  [Begin Ramirez recording] We are ready. We have implemented 
the Sovereignty Plan which permits the deployment of the 
National Armed Forces when police forces cannot effectively 
check public order disruptions. So far there has been no need 
to use any Armed Forces units, and I hope that they are not 
needed. [end recording]

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Venezuelan media monitored at Panama 
Bureau have been observed to carry reportage and commentary on 
reaction to the Venezuelan Government's implementation and 
subsequent temporary suspension of the value-added tax (VAT). 
  Caracas Venezolana de Television Network in Spanish at 2350 
GMT on 20 January, in its regularly scheduled "The News" 
newscast, broadcasts a two-minute report that notes the people 
of Venezuela had "serious doubts" about the VAT following its 
implementation -- doubts that were never adequately addressed by 
state agencies charged with regulating the tax. In turn, the 
report adds, the VAT "shocked" consumers. After noting that the 
VAT has been suspended, the report cuts a video recording of 
Deputy Defense Minister Rear Admiral Ramirez Fernandez, who 
says: "This is an executive branch decision that must be carried 
out. Nevertheless, once the effects of the VAT have been 
properly evaluated, it will be implemented once again." 
  The report then cuts to a video recording of private 
economist Francisco Rodriguez, who says: "One of the VAT's main 
benefits is that it will help cut the fiscal deficit, which in 
turn will help reduce inflation and interest rates." The report 
concludes with the announcer noting that economists agree that 
the confusion Venezuela has experienced over the VAT's 
implementation has occurred in other countries in which the tax 
has been implemented. 
  A day earlier, Caracas Venezolana de Television broadcasts a 
related report in its "The News" newscast at 1550 GMT on 19 
January. This two-minute report cites other economists who say 
the suspension of the tax was a "wise" move. Noting that the 
VAT's future now depends on decisions to be made by the 
administration of President-elect Rafael Caldera, the report 
says most economists agree that the nation's fiscal deficit is 
quite large, adding that sooner or later drastic measures will 
have to be taken to control it. According to this report, 
economists believe "the government should keep in mind that the 
population is quite concerned and is in no way pleased with the 
current conditions." 
  Meanwhile, Caracas EL DIARIO DE CARACAS in Spanish carries 
two 350-word editorials on the VAT. On page 2 of its 19 January 
edition, the newspaper says three things truly unite the 
Venezuelan people: 1) opposition to the military draft, 2) 
opposition to war in general, and 3) most recently, opposition 
to the VAT. According to the editorial, "There is nothing more 
unpleasant to Venezuelans than the VAT, and one is constantly 
reminded of it whenever a purchase is made." The editorial adds 
that with every purchase, the state reminds consumers that it is 
dipping into their pockets. In turn, the editorial claims, if a 
repeal of the VAT is indeed impossible, consumers should then 
feel free to pressure the state into improving government 
services. 
  Another editorial published on page 2 of its 18 January 
edition notes that the Venezuelan Government has failed to act 
swiftly and decidedly in terms of the VAT. The newspaper 
criticizes the government for its hesitancy. The editorial 
notes that, while the government has decided to suspend the tax 
for retailers, importers and wholesalers still continue to 
charge it. The editorial continues by saying that in October 
1993, the government said the cost would not be transfered to 
consumers, while, in reality, that is exactly what is taking 
place. 
  According to the editorial, "Prices have increased three 
times over the past four months, and all because of government 
improvisations and contradictions in terms of this issue." The 
editorial adds: "These contraditions have led to consumer 
confusion, speculation, price controls, and lately to violent 
disturbances in some areas. The perception is that in October 
the government decided to suspend the VAT to consumers out of 
fear that it would interfere with the elections. Now, it is 
suspending it once again because violence has broken out." The 
editorial concludes by saying it is time for the government to 
take adequate measures to evaluate the true effects of 
implementing the VAT.

<F P=106> [Speech by Venezuelan President Ramon J. Velasquez; place </F>
not given; broadcast in progress -- live] 
  [Text] ...due to the recent Banco Latino intervention and 
the rumors circulating throughout the country, I believe it is 
my duty to deliver a message to the country on the position of 
the national government. To confront the Banco Latino crisis and 
its pernicious consequences to Venezuela, the government is 
adopting a series of measures, joined in an overall plan, to 
serve Banco Latino depositors and reestablish confidence in the 
Venezuelan financial system, hit hard at this moment not only by 
this bank's crisis but also by rumor campaigns that are 
seriously hurting the country. 
  The complexity of the problem demands everyone's commitment 
and participation. The program I am announcing today has the 
support of the country's financial authorities and banking 
system. President-elect Rafael Caldera has been consulted about 
the program, and we trust he will give it the necessary 
continuity during his administration. Likewise, we have informed 
the political parties so the initiatives that need to be taken 
will find the necessary receptivity in Congress, which will be 
convened soon. 
  To address the situation that arose following the Banco 
Latino intervention, I am close to appointing a board of 
intervention comprising Julio Santodomingo, who will preside 
over the board, Hernan Oyarzabal; Cesario Cadenas; and (Jose 
Grazovechio). All of these people have broad banking, financial, 
and legal experience, and they enjoy the respect and trust of 
the financial community. This board of intervention will assume 
the duties the banking law establishes. 
  2. [number as heard] Advisory Council. In order to support 
the board of intervention and channel the support Venezuelan 
banks are giving the state during this difficult situation, I am 
appointing an advisory council comprising the following bank 
presidents: (Edgard Dao), Banco del Caribe; Jose Maria 
Nogueroles, Banco Provincial; Gustavo Marturet, Banco Mercantil; 
Jose Bouza, Banco Venezuela; Herbie Benacerrat, Banco Union; 
(Jose Alvarez Stelin), Banco Consolidado; Juan Santaella, 
Bancor; and Jose Francisco Otero, Banco Italo. I have received 
clear signals from members of the Venezuelan banking community 
on the confidence all of them have in this effort and they have 
delegated their representation and support to this group of 
colleagues. 
  The Banco Latino action program will give priority to the 
following: 
  Expediting depositors' accounts. To this end, we intend to 
begin with accounts of up to 100,000 bolivares, as announced, 
and continue progressively with larger accounts. 
  Larger accounts in individuals' names and public and 
private institutions will be handled as Fogade's [Deposit 
Guarantee Fund] financial support system begins to operate and 
with the cooperation of banks. Negotiations for the recovery of 
Banco Latino's loans will start immediately with effective 
collection actions and the execution of all applicable 
collaterals. External auditors will be hired as soon as possible 
to determine the true situation of the institution and 
subsidiaries, both locally and abroad. No later than 90 days 
from now, such reports should serve to make the most appropriate 
decisions. 
  There are several possibilities for selling Banco Latino and 
subsidiary assets or business units, both within and without the 
country, which foreign and domestic investors have already shown 
an interest in. The intervention board will take the greatest 
care in preserving the value of the Banco Latino and subsidiary 
assests and extracting the largest possible profit from the sale 
of assets to minimize the cost of this crisis. The auditors' 
examination will include, not only the institution's accounts, 
but Banco Latino's methods in granting investment loans. 
Pertinent responsibilities will be determined very carefully. 
  4. [number as heard] To alleviate the pressure this crisis 
and the pressure the wave of rumors are applying on the 
financial system, the Central Bank of Venezuela board of 
directors has agreed to the following measures: 
  a) Given this situation, loan support for the Bernay 
monetary market has been activated to give banks the necessary 
short-term loans. 
  b) The Central Bank mandatory reserve has been reduced from 
15 to 12 percent. This measure releases 26 billion [currency not 
specified], which will make it possible for banks to meet the 
liquidity needs derived from the Banco Latino crisis and the 
depositors' requirements. 
  c) The existing system for the Central Bank mandatory 
reserve system is hereby modified. The foreign currency deposit 
will be made in the same currency in which the obligation was 
incurred. 
  d) To give Fogade financial assistance according to the law 
to enable this institution to meet the needs derived from the 
Banco Latino intervention and contribute to the recycling of 
funds in the national banking system. 
  e) To grant financial assistance to banks facing liquidity 
problems as a result of this irregular situation. 
  5. I have instructed the banking superintendant to go to the 
proper authorities and request all of the pertinent civil and 
penal actions against the individuals responsible for the Banco 
Latino crisis. 
  6. I have instructed the attorney general to go to the 
Supreme Court of Justice and apprise it of all the lawsuits that 
are being processed to establish responsibility for the Banco 
Latino case. 
  7. I have ordered the police to take specific actions 
against individuals and commercial establishments that spread 
rumors concerning the banking situation. This is a crime that 
jeopardizes state security, and the full weight of the law will 
be brought to bear against these people. 
  I am willing to admit the country's stability has been 
threatened in an irresponsible manner. I urge the public not to 
spread these rumors. The government and financial authorities 
are taking all the necessary steps to ensure the proper 
functioning of all Venezuelan banks and to protect the 
depositors' interests. The best cooperation you can give is to 
remain calm. Banco Latino depositors will be taken care of, and 
customers of other Venezuelan banks have nothing to fear. Your 
banks are capable of maintaining operations with absolute 
normalcy, and for that they have the full support of the Central 
Bank of Venezuela. Good night.

<F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Pachano from "The News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] President Ramon J. Velasquez has responded to the 
charges made by the Fedecamaras [Venezuelan Federation of 
Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry] president 
[Edgardo Romero Nava] that the government is partly responsible 
for what happened at Banco Latino. Velasquez said emphatically 
that the government had been closely watching the bank since 
November. Finance Minister Silva said the Banco Latino disaster 
was due to the risks top bank officials took with bank funds 
rather than to withdrawals made by state institutions. 
  [Begin recording] [Velasquez] I want to emphasize that I 
have been monitoring this case since late November. I have 
continually held night meetings with those who are bound by law 
to [words indistinct]. We have had countless night meetings 
with the finance minister; the Central Bank president [Ruth de 
Krivoy]; Bank Superintendent Roger Urbina; Bank Superintendent 
Negron; Fogade [Deposit Guarantee Fund] President Esperanza 
Martino; Dr. Hernan Anzola, government representative at the 
Central Bank; and Banco Latino shareholders. I had to trust the 
information given to me by the Bank Superintendency and by the 
Central Bank, so what Dr. Romero said is untrue. I have been 
very interested in this case because it is my job. However, I 
had to accept the information provided to me by the Bank 
Superintendency as the truth. 
  [Silva] This institution's history is linked to the 
political advancement of some of its leaders, but this is 
something that will be explained in due time. [end recording] 
  Just as President Velasquez had, [Deputy] Reinaldo Cervini 
rejected the charges made by the Fedecamaras president and 
called for a thorough investigation. 
  Renowned expert Domingo Maza Zabala also spoke about the 
case 
after meeting with President Velasquez, saying that people must 
believe that the financial system will solve this crisis and 
that their funds will be recovered. However, Maza also thinks 
that specific responsibilities must be determined. 
  [Begin recording] [Maza] The financial institutions must be 
interested in clarifying what happened and how it happened. The 
new banking law must be good and efficient in order to correct 
these irregularities, mistakes, and vices of bank management, 
because the banking service is not a private business but an 
eminently public service in which the state must be interested 
and for which it must be responsible. 
  [Cervini] It is distressing to realize that what happened at 
the Commerce Bank or at the National Discount Bank could happen 
in Venezuela; that rich businessmen, such as (Gonzalo de 
Roldoma) and his son, are stashing their fortunes abroad but 
keeping bankrupt businesses in Venezuela. This must stop. If 
shareholders are responsible, they must be liable. The concept 
of financial crime must be established [as heard]. I don't 
think the country should operate under privately enforced rules. 
This is not a state problem. It is a state problem, however, 
to improve the General Bank Superintendency [Superintendencia 
General de Bancos]. [end recording] 
  Domingo Maza Zabala also spoke about the possibility that 
the 
National Congress may repeal or amend the value-added tax [VAT]. 
He thinks the Venezuelan fiscal system requires sweeping reforms 
and recommends that if the National Congress decides to repeal 
VAT, it will have to seek other fiscal revenues to replace those 
generated by VAT. He added that if it is not done, much larger 
economic imbalances will be created.

  [Text] Caracas, 19 Jan (EFE) -- The government intervention 
of Banco Latino, one of the largest in Venezuela, has affected 
the country's image abroad, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Fernando 
Ochoa Antich said today. 
  The foreign minister said the crisis of Banco Latino and its 
subsequent intervention, which the government ordered last week, 
has "damaged the image" of Venezuela in the international 
financial world. 
  The bank closed its doors 14 January due to a serious crisis 
of liquidity, after some 55 billion bolivars (some $514 million) 
were withdrawn over the last three months, according to reports 
by the bank board of directors. 
  Ochoa said the government's intervention is aimed at 
protecting the deposits of depositors and defining what is the 
real situation of that bank. 
  At the end of last year, Banco Latino was the Venezuelan 
financial institution with the largest amount of deposits and 
the third largest credit portfolio holder. The government 
intervention may have significant consequences in the national 
economic area. 
  The Venezuelan foreign minister said Venezuelan authorities 
must establish clearly the criminal responsibilities that may 
exist in this case, in which the savings of thousands of 
depositors and Venezuelan Government institutions have been 
endangered. 
  Venezuelan judicial authorities have ordered an 
investigation 
to establish if the Banco Latino directors have committed 
embezzlement against that financial institution.

  [Text] The emergency measures announced by President Ramon 
J. Velasquez to deal with the national financial system crisis 
resulting from the fall of Banco Latino, and to stop the 
"dangerous" rumor campaign, was warmly welcomed by banking 
representatives who said the program arouses feelings of 
security and confidence in the future. 
  As he left the site of the president's speech, to which all 
the sector's representatives were invited, National Banking 
Council President Jose Bouzas Izquierdo said that the 
president's announcement to the effect that the BCV [Venezuelan 
Central Bank] will support the country's financial institutions 
constitutes the beginning of the definitive solution of the 
crisis created by the Banco Latino intervention. Bouzas 
characterized as very healthy the measures aimed at stemming the 
wave of rumors, comments, and remarks about specific banks 
which, in his opinion, should be rejected for the good of the 
financial sector and to safeguard those banks' depositors. 
  The president was very emphatic in pointing out that 
criminal 
action will be taken against individuals who in any way spread 
such rumors or instigate distrust toward certain financial 
institutions. That is a fundamental issue, Bouzas said; it is up 
to us to work within the framework of the law and to adhere to 
the healthiest banking conventions, and it is up to the news 
media to echo the president's remarks concerning the need to 
control those rumors. 
  Meanwhile, Finance Minister Carlos Rafael Silva said it was 
necessary to undertake this package of measures in view of the 
regrettable Banco Latino episode. In Silva's opinion, this plan 
not only has the full support of the national government but 
that of the president-elect and his team of collaborators. 
  Silva stated explicitly that reducing the quantity of bank 
deposits will allow the release of [word indistinct] that could 
be very useful at this time of financial need. Silva confirmed 
the resignations of Banking Superintendent Roger Urbina and 
Fogade [Deposit Guarantee Fund] President Esperanza Martino who, 
according to Silva, resigned "to facilitate the work of the 
next government."

  [Excerpt] President Ramon J. Velasquez and President-elect 
Rafael Caldera have formally asked the U.S. Government to 
participate in consultations within the GATT in the hope of 
satisfactorily settling a controversy stemming from a new 
regulation imposed by the United States that will harm 
Venezuelan gasoline exports to that market. 
  An interministerial commission was established to coordinate 
the Venezuelan strategy. It is made up of the Venezuelan 
Petroleum Corporation, the Ministry of Energy and Mines, the 
Ministry of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, and the 
Foreign Trade Institute [ICE], which led the commission in 
filing this request through the U.S. Embassy in Caracas. 
  Miguel Rodriguez Mendoza, ICE minister of state-president 
[title as published], pointed out that "the regulation 
promulgated on 15 December by the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency violates, according to Venezuela, GATT Article III 
(National Treaty) for establishing different quality standards 
for imported and domestic gasoline." 
  This will have negative effects on Venezuelan exports 
beginning in 1985. Initial estimates indicate that gasoline 
exports to the United States could drop by 50 percent, that is, 
a $150 million revenue loss. This figure does not take into 
account the impact on trade of a possible exclusion of Venezuela 
from the U.S. market for a period of about two years. 
  Rodriguez Mendoza pointed out that the Venezuelan Government 
position was channeled through a letter to U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor. The letter calls for the start of 
consultations within GATT to determine the legality of 
regulations approved by the United States detrimental to 
Venezuelan gasoline exports. 
  The ICE president said that, based on Article XXII (1) of 
the 
GATT General Agreement, the U.S. regulation violates Venezuela's 
rights and causes that country to break its commitments. GATT 
procedures state that consultations must start within 30 days. 
  He pointed out that should the outcome be unfavorable to 
Venezuela, our country may request the establishment of a 
tribunal or arbitration panel (made up of three independent 
experts) that would be tasked with issuing a ruling within six 
months. Thus, this controversy -- that we hope will yield a 
favorable ruling for our country -- should be settled this year 
to avoid the economic impact that this regulation could cause 
beginning in 1995. 
  The U.S. regulation could remove Venezuelan petroleum 
exports 
from that market. This is the first time that Venezuela, on an 
individual basis, will resort to GATT controversy-solving 
procedures. We have, however, some experience in this area 
because we participated -- not as a litigant but as an 
interested party -- in the controversies linked to the tuna 
embargo (United States) and banana problem (EEC). [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Pachano from the Miraflores Presidential </F>
Palace in Caracas; from "The News" newscast] 
  [Text] President Ramon J. Velasquez and President-elect 
Rafael Caldera, have said there are no plans to control the 
exchange rate of the Venezuelan currency. The two appealed for 
calm and for preventing a flight of foreign exchange because 
this would not help the situation, on the contrary, it would 
worsen it. They insisted that common sense will determine the 
dollar exchange rate. 
  The two agreed that the measures announced last night by 
President Velasquez will be maintained and there will be 
continuity. President-elect Rafael Caldera has reiterated his 
support for the announcements made by President Velasquez. 
  [Begin recording] [Velasquez] Banking policies will be 
conserved, first because they are the product of lengthy 
analyses in which bank authorities and bankers have 
participated; they are the product of experience; and they are 
the result of the banking sector's decision to respond 
positively to the Venezuelan situation. 
  [Calderas] The measures that have been announced have my 
support and that of all Venezuelans because the financial 
situation is important for all of us. In that declaration there 
are very important points. It not only lists the current 
government's commitments that will be inherited by the 
government over which I will preside, but also lists the banking 
sector's commitment making it obligatory for the presidents of 
the country's largest banks to maintain a healthy financial 
system and a system deserving of the Venezuelan people's trust. 
[end recording] 
  The president-elect reported his government's firm decision 
to back judicial rulings because although he has nothing against 
anybody, he believes the country wants the implementation of 
severe measures to prevent a repeat of past events. 
  The Banco Latino intervention board was sworn in this 
afternoon at the Presidential Palace. Finance Minister Carlos 
Silva introduced to the media the three members of the board 
noting that the three have much banking experience. 
  [Begin recording] [Silva] We trust they will objectively 
evaluate that bank and adopt the necessary measures. 
  [Board President Jose Santo Domingo] Regarding our future 
plans [words indistinct]. 
  [Unidentified reporter] The scheduled 28 January reopening 
of 
the bank could be modified now that you have been sworn in as 
bank interveners? 
  [Santo Domingo] I think that date will stay. Yes. The 
Deposit Guarantee Fund will supply funds necessary to pay 
accounts having a balance under 100,000 bolivares. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Report on meeting by Venezuelan President Ramon J. </F>
Velasquez and Venezuelan President-elect Rafael Caldera with the 
Territorial Governors Council at Miraflores Palace in Caracas on 
17 January] 
  [Text] The latest Territorial Governors Council gathering 
that took place yesterday at Miraflores Palace turned into a 
meeting to bid farewell to President Ramon J. Velasquez and at 
the same time welcome President-elect Rafael Caldera. The 
meeting was also an occasion to award Governors Enrique Salas 
Romer [Carabobo State] and Carlos Tablante [Aragua State]. 
Andres Velasquez [Bolivar State governor] decided not to 
participate. 
  President Velasquez said: "To me, it is a very pleasant duty 
to convene this--the last governors meeting of my 
administration. Fifteen days from now, on 2 February, Dr. Rafael 
Caldera will be sworn-in as constitutional president of the 
Republic for the next five-year term. This event will mark the 
Constitution of the executive and legislative branches for the 
1994 to 1999 term." 
  The president told the governors he was grateful for their 
valuable cooperation to the national government as well as to 
his administration. 
  He referred to the past six difficult months of a country in 
crisis during which the governors played a very fundamental 
role. In a country with an oversized, centralized system, he 
described the decision to have direct elections for governors as 
the most significant revolutionary event of the century. 
  President Velasquez--who from within the State Reform 
Commission was one of the individuals who presented the bill 
leading to the direct election of governors--said that as he had 
promised when he took office, he had been able to create the 
Ministry of Decentralization, and Minister Allan Brewer Carias 
has prepared a memoir that includes a 1,000-page guideline. 
  "What I would like to tell all of you once more is that 
democracy will be more difficult to defeat when there is no 
longer one single group to defeat," Velasquez stated. 
  He wished each governor the best success, adding that he 
does 
not need any official position to continue being a staunch 
supporter for decentralization. He added that he is 
enthusiastic about the progress the country had accomplished in 
each of its regions. 
<H5>  Joint Effort by the People </H5>
  During his remarks, Rafael Caldera thanked outgoing 
President 
Velasquez for the invitation to meet personally with the federal 
governors. 
  "I believe the situation through which the country is going 
demands a joint, positive, and fruitful effort by the central, 
state, and municipal government. These last two have acquired 
progressive autonomy ever since it was decided to submit the 
election of governors and mayors to a popular vote," Caldera 
said. 
  He added he is convinced the country's main problems demand 
a 
joint effort by all sectors of the public. 
  For example, he cited the problems of personal safety and 
social issues such as housing and education, as well as health. 
  "President Ramon J. Velasquez has given us an example of 
magnitude, a very permanent and persistent disposition to 
acknowledge the willingness of the various entities to take on 
the necessary responsibilities. I believe that task must 
continue," Caldera added. 
  He mentioned immediately the fiscal deficit, which he 
described as severe, and said he needs the understanding of all 
sectors of the public. The president-elect added that fiscal 
deficit and currency devaluation force everyone to practice 
austerity measures and double our efforts to ensure a more 
effective tax collection campaign. 
<H5>  VAT [value-added tax] and Banco Latino </H5>
  The president-elect added that the fiscal deficit problem is 
growing constantly worse. The governors have clearly 
acknowledged that in their respective states, and throughout 
Venezuela in general, people react emotionally to implementation 
of VAT. It is obvious that many circumstances have contributed 
to this emotional reaction, and among these circumstances are 
organizational problems and Venezuela's difficulty in collecting 
taxes, which, in this specific case, are felt much more keenly. 
  Caldera explained that added to the pressure of inflation is 
the abuse perpetrated by many unscrupulous sectors that have 
used VAT as a pretext for speculation, forcing President 
Velasquez to adopt measures provided for in the Consumer 
Protection Law three years after implementation of the economic 
readjustment measures. 
  Caldera said the reformation of the tax system requires 
harmony, which is a priority in dealing with the fiscal deficit. 
  The president-elect also discussed the government 
intervention of Banco Latino: The situation of a huge banking 
institution in which are deposited the savings and resources of 
a considerable number of institutions and individuals--many of 
them with connections to the various sectors of national 
life--is another issue that makes this deficit situation very 
serious. 
  This is why I feel obligated during this, my first meeting 
with the governors, to beg them to be especially understanding 
about this problem. The fiscal deficit does not involve only 
the national government. It is a problem that involves the 
entire public sector and--I would dare say--the entire 
Venezuelan nation, because there is no sector of public life or 
civilian society that is not affected by this situation, with 
which it is our duty to deal. 
  Caldera described the panorama as serious, delicate and 
worrisome, yet tempered by a positive element: the favorable, 
general expectation expressed by all the social sectors after 5 
December [the presidential elections]. The people have 
acknowledged the problems the new constitutional term must 
resolve, and there is hope that our efforts will be directed 
primarily toward helping the Venezuelan people. 
<H5>  An Explosive Situation </H5>
  Caldera said he has initiated talks with certain branches of 
the international financial system, especially with the World 
Bank, and that he is encouraged by that organization's 
acceptance of the struggle against poverty as a priority. 
  Caldera cited the recent violence in [name indistinct] del 
Estero in Argentina, the civil war in Chiapas State, Mexico, and 
the incidents in Sabaneta and other Venezuelan jails, and he 
said they were not chance coincidences, rather, the effects of 
the same cause which in all of these countries could become 
explosive. 
  In reference to the pledge made by the United States and 
countries in this hemisphere to strengthen democracy, Caldera 
said: 
  I insist that democracy, political rights, and freedoms must 
have an economic foundation but also a social foundation, which 
are inseparable; harmonious solutions are required to achieve 
the genuine strengthening of a system of life which, as the 
preface of our Constitution states, is the only system 
compatible with human dignity; it is the system whereby the 
general public enjoys freedom of political and human rights. 
  Caldera reiterated his gratitude to President Velasquez and 
acknowledged the huge effort he made to fulfill the historic 
task entrusted to him. 
<H5>  To Pursue Decentralization </H5>
  The governor of Carabobo State and president of the 
Association of Governors said that yesterday's meeting in 
Miraflores was to bid farewell to President Velasquez and 
welcome Caldera. 
  I believe that if this meeting served a purpose, it was the 
consolidation of the Territorial Governors Council which, 
established through a decree issued by President Velasquez, 
created a body that unifies the president, his ministers, and 
governors to make certain important decisions. Dr. Caldera's 
presence proves that his government will lend continuity to the 
decentralization policies initiated by President Velasquez; at 
least that is how we have interpreted it. 
  The governor added that it was a cordial meeting during 
which 
the governors expressed to President Velasquez the entire 
country's acknowledgement of the wise manner in which he was 
able to overcome the crisis.

  [Text] President Ramon J. Velasquez did not accept Finance 
Minister Carlos Rafael Silva's resignation, who has been 
threatening to leave his post if the value-added tax [VAT] is 
suspended. 
  When leaving the Miraflores Palace at 2330 last night, the 
finance minister appeared nervous and reticent. He tried to 
evade reporters by leaving by the back door, but when he 
realized that he had been detected he had no choice but to 
respond to some questions and admit that the president had not 
accepted his resignation. 
  Apparently none of the ministers who attended the meeting 
convoked by the president at 2000 last night to discuss the 
Latino Bank matter knew about the resignation. For this reason, 
it is believed that the meeting between the president and the 
finance minister was private. 
  The interview went like this: 
  [Silva] I completely disagree with the measure adopted 
yesterday by the cabinet. 
  [Unidentified Reporter] Did you resign? 
  [Silva] I spoke with the president. He did not accept it. 
  [Reporter] Do you back the decree suspending the VAT? 
  [Silva] That decree will never have my name on it. 
  [Reporter] Are you leaving your post? 
  [Silva] Not now. There are too many problems. 
  The meeting to discuss the Latino Bank matter was also 
attended by the defense minister because the Armed Forces were 
negatively affected by the bank's situation. The defense 
minister said that the Army has a 3-billion-bolivar trust in 
that bank. 
  Meanwhile, Federal District Governor Cesar Rodriguez 
reported 
that the meeting was to discuss the Latino Bank matter. The 
president of the Central Bank of Venezuela, the minister of 
coordination and planning, the superintendent of banks, and the 
president of the Deposit Guarantee Fund agreed to create work 
teams to decide what to do about the bank's liquidity situation. 
  [Reporter] Was this the only decision adopted? 
  [Silva] That and a report on the analysis made by the Bank 
Superintendency was discussed. This analysis has had 
provisional results because it has not yet checked on bank 
investments and assets. They believe that in 15 days they will 
have a clear idea about resolving the situation, but in the 
meantime partial solutions aimed at guaranteeing the public's 
savings will be implemented.

  [Text] The fact that the United States is announcing the 
name of the candidate it will support for OAS secretary general 
so far in advance is significant, because it shows that the 
North Americans' view of the OAS is somewhat different from the 
way Latin American countries visualize it. 
  This was surmised from remarks by Deputy Foreign Minister 
Fernando Gerbasi, who, during talks with EL GLOBO, has said this 
is the first time the United States has disclosed the name of 
the candidate for the OAS position. 
  According to Gerbasi, the North Americans "are looking at an 
OAS that is economy-oriented with emphasis on the idea of a free 
market, and thus they think integration can be thoroughly 
achieved through it." 
  He feels this stand is respectable, "but it undermines the 
importance and significance of the OAS, an organization that 
should have its own political criteria, because any group of 
governments cannot hope to become something technical or have a 
partial vision of society. Society must be viewed as a whole, 
because, basically, any action within a society is a political 
action." 
  Asked about the importance of support of the United States, 
as a world power, to determine the victory of the new secretary 
general, Garbasi has said: "We are not in a bipolar world, but 
it is not a unipolar world either. Perhaps this is true in the 
military but not in the political or economic spheres."

  [Text] President-elect Rafael Caldera has met with members 
of the Presidential Committee to Reform the State [Copre] to 
study constitutional reforms. Copre members have handed to the 
president-elect a document containing the main reforms, which, 
according to this group, should be implemented during the next 
constitutional term. Three salient points are highlighted: 
profound reforms of the constitution and public administration, 
and decentralization. 
  Among the major changes are a reorganization of the Congress 
of the republic, a review of the Supreme Electoral Council, and 
the possible creation of a post that already exists in most 
European countries; that is, that of prime minister. 
  [Begin Copre President Trino Marquez, as identified by 
caption, recording, in progress] ...agrees with this proposal. 
President Caldera told us about the need to reform the 
Constitution to allow the creation of the post of prime 
minister, because certain regulations restrict the relationship 
between the Executive Branch and other branches; thus, a 
constitutional reform is needed. This was one of his proposals. 
We must firmly promote a comprehensive reform of the 
Constitution. [end recording] 
  At any rate, the president of the Republic cannot create a 
new ministry. As a last resort he could create a ministry 
without portfolio, however, solely to give him advice.

<F P=106> [Interview with Freddy Munoz, newly elected senator and </F>
secretary general of Movement Toward Socialism, by Alfredo 
Palacios; from the "Opinion in the News" segment of "The News" 
newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Palacios Good afternoon, senator. 
  [Munoz] Good afternoon Alfredo and friends. 
  [Palacios] MAS [Movement Toward Socialism] will be in the 
government for the first time. Although it has been in the 
government at the regional level, it will now be in the 
government at the national level. MAS will be in the ruling 
group at a time when the country is experiencing a difficult 
period. For an example of this, we just have to think of the 
economic problems and the enormous fiscal hole in which we are. 
  [Munoz] It is not a hole but a long tunnel of financial 
difficulties. 
  [Palacios] We have spiraling inflation and constant Bolivar 
devaluations. Although we understand that President-elect 
Caldera will be the central figure, what will be the policy or 
guidelines that MAS will promote in the new government? 
  [Munoz] You already said it. Definitely, a very important 
part of what will be done is in Caldera's hands. The specific 
guidelines to carry out the policies are in his hands. Of 
course, we will be a force within the government. We want that, 
and Caldera wants that. Thus, it should be very clear to 
everyone, the public, the president -- he is already very clear 
about it -- our people, and the MAS leadership that we will be a 
force that will enter the government through the big doors and 
with great responsibility. 
  [Palacios] In specific terms, what does that mean? 
  [Munoz] It means that we will participate in formulating the 
great policies of the new government. It will be done through a 
dialogue with Dr. Caldera and those who make up his government 
team, including MAS members and friends. It also means that we 
will act as a force that will watch and follow up the work done 
by the government. This force will also analyze the government 
and draw up conclusions. In the third place, we will be a link 
between the government and people in the streets, the civic 
society, and the world of the majority. 
  We will not be a force that because it is in the government 
it becomes a staunch supporter, loses its critical spirit, 
forgets its autonomy, and only talks and acts as the government. 
  [Palacios] Does it mean that at any given moment you could 
act as an opposition force? 
  [Munoz] I am not saying that. I am saying that we must be a 
force that is not unconditional. Why? Because by being a 
government force, we have great responsibility to the country. 
In fact, we decided to enter the government and back Caldera 
because we felt that -- under the present historic circumstance 
-- we were fulfilling our responsibility to the country. 
Caldera seemed to be the candidate who -- under the present 
circumstances -- could best do the difficult job of facing the 
situation you mentioned when we were talking about economic 
matters. However, it is a situation that spreads to other areas 
of our lives. Consequently, our primary obligation is to the 
country. Our obligation to the country is partly fulfilled 
through our work with the government, but particularly through 
our direct contact with the people. 
  [Palacios] But to have a position of weight within the 
government, you should hold important posts in that government, 
especially in what is known as the economic cabinet. Will you 
be present there? 
  [Munoz] We have been holding talks with the president. It 
is no secret that he is not finished deciding who will be in his 
government. It is true that he is discussing that with us too. 
It is not our right but our duty to discuss these matters with 
him. We are not a force that will tell him: Here are our people 
ready to obey you. No, we will be part of the government, but 
we will discuss and reach a basic understanding as to what 
course the government will take. 
  To support Caldera, we discussed a basic offer for the 
country. We reached agreements. 
  [Palacios] To give the country that course... 
  [Munoz interrupting] ...our presence must have the necessary 
weight. 
  [Palacios] That is correct. 
  [Munoz] Only if this presence has the necessary weight, will 
we participate in the new government. I think this is something 
Dr. Caldera understands very well. For this reason, we said 
that there will be an agreement. 
  [Palacios] Amid the situation I described at the 
beginning, there is the VAT problem. This is one of the most 
controversial issues right now. 
  [Munoz] That is true. 
  [Palacios] And it will continue to be a hot issue until we 
see the measures that the new government will take. What is the 
proposal you have in this regard: eliminating the VAT once and 
for all, and if so, what will you replace it with? What will 
you do? 
  [Munoz] Let me tell you what we MAS members think, what we 
have proposed to Dr. Caldera, what we are discussing with him. 
When I say discussing I mean we are exchanging opinions. 
  During the electoral campaign we said the VAT should be 
suspended, not eliminated for good. We believe it is not 
correct for the VAT to never have existed. There are only five 
countries left in the world without VAT. These are countries 
with different characteristics and levels of development. 
  We said it should be suspended to determine how the tax 
could 
be created within the framework of global tax reform and, above 
all, within the framework of global fiscal reform. Here, when 
the VAT was presented as a proposal, not under the Velasquez 
administration but under the Carlos Andres Perez administration, 
the government wrongfully tried to compensate for the enormous 
reduction resulting from the approval of the income Tax Reform 
Law, which reduced payments from higher-income sectors, with the 
VAT. We said this was absolutely absurd, that is to reduce the 
income tax contribution from the wealthy to such a level. We 
said it was completely unfair from the social viewpoint, and 
erroneous from the fiscal policy viewpoint. 
  [Palacios] Does this mean that you are thinking about 
increasing income tax? 
  [Munoz] Yes. That is one.... [pauses] our first proposal.... 
  [Palacios, interrupting] Experience has taught us that 
taxpayers somehow evade income tax payments.... 
  [Munoz, interrupting] That is right, but VAT payments are 
also evaded. World experience indicates that the level of 
evasion for income tax is higher than that for VAT, but VAT 
payments are also evaded. It has been estimated, in places 
where collections are performed more efficiently, that VAT 
payments are evaded by at least 30 to 40 percent. 
  [Palacios] In this fiscal reform you have announced, is 
there 
any specific measure that can be made public? 
  [Munoz] One, we will work to reform the Income Tax Law to 
increase collections of this tax. Two, we will reorganize the 
tax collections system and will implement new collections 
techniques that may include hiring specific specialized 
companies to perform collection duties. These techniques have 
been applied in other countries, and even in some Venezuelan 
states. Three, some taxes such as tax on luxury consumption, 
which is fair from the social standpoint.... 
  [Palacios, interrupting] Will these taxes be enough to close 
the fiscal deficit? This is the great concern facing 
Venezuelans. 
  [Munoz] We will also reduce spending as much as possible. 
The fiscal gap is reduced and is definitely closed not only by 
increasing fiscal revenues, but also by cutting government 
spending. 
  [Palacios] Reduction of government spending usually 
translates into dismissal of personnel. 
  [Munoz] Not necessarily. 
  [Palacios] If a real spending reduction is desired, 
personnel 
must be dismissed. 
  [Munoz] Listen, government spending is rigid in Venezuela. 
That means it has several components whose dimensions are seldom 
modified. But there is a part of spending that can indeed be 
reduced. This portion may not represent one fourth of total 
spending, but it may represent one tenth or one fifteenth. 
  Following a path of alternative solutions that do not close 
the gap, the government may propose with the understanding and 
acceptance of the population -- which will see there are other 
decisions and actions being taken and promises being met, while 
the government is working efficiently -- a reformulation of the 
VAT-type tax. 
  [Palacios] To conclude this interview because we are short 
on 
time, did you aspire to run for the post of Senate president. 
  [Munoz] No, I did not hope to run. 
  [Palacios] At least this is what you had said. 
  [Munoz] MAS proposed that we should [words indistinct] 
continues to feel that way. 
  [Palacios] National Convergence has proposed a different 
candidate. Does this mean you are experiencing your first big 
difference with National Convergence. 
  [Munoz] No, it is only a difference and we are going to 
discuss it. 
  [Palacios] We thank Freddy Munoz for being with us today.

  [Text] Barcelona, [Ven] 20 Jan (Venpres) -- In light of 
the Anzoategui State Metropolitan Police's inability to deal 
with the violence that has taken place over the past two days in 
the Barcelona-Puerto La Cruz metropolitan area, the two cities 
have been virtually militarized as of today. 
  The measure was adopted by Miguel Aparicio Ramirez, general 
commander of the Anzoategui State Military Garrison, at the 
governor's behest because the police could no longer control the 
violence which last week and over the past two days has evolved 
into vandalism, pillage, and plunder. 
  Barcelona and Puerto La Cruz were totally calm today. The 
presence of Army and National Guard units patrolling the streets 
of the Barcelona-Puerto La Cruz conurbation was noted and 
welcomed by residents because, at least for today, calm has been 
restored in the area. 
  Transportation service has fully resumed, allowing workers 
and students to fulfill their duties. Stores have reopened and 
are conducting business as usual. 
  Governor Ovidio Gonzalez, who finally met with reporters 
this 
morning, said the situation in northern Anzoategui State has 
been totally normalized, but he refused to admit that Barcelona 
as well as Puerto La Cruz had awoke to [words indistinct] units 
of the Armed Forces and National Guard, saying it is a routine 
decision when there has been violence such as the recent 
incidents. 
  Gonzalez disclosed that agreements had been reached by the 
leaders of the Anzoategui State Transportation Union and the 
mayors' offices of the state's two leading municipalities, which 
are Bolivar (Barcelona) and Sotillo (Puerto La Cruz), to release 
[sincerar] fares. While this happens, bus fares will be lowered 
until the respective agreements are signed by the transportation 
sector and the municipal councils, which are the authorities 
that set bus fares. 
  On another issue, the governor denied that the search 
conducted by police at the Anzoategui branch of Oriente 
University was a search, claiming that the measure was adopted 
to prevent trucks transporting food and other merchandise from 
being hijacked and sacked inside the university. 
  Gonzalez said the police entered the university to retrieve 
trucks that had been hijacked by hooded individuals and 
infiltrators determined to create chaos in the city. The police 
accomplished that task without violating any student rights. 
  Aside from that, the governor added, we cannot allow a 
person, just because he is a student and can seek shelter at the 
university, to perpetrate abuses and create disorder that 
affects the general public. I was once a student, and such 
things did not take place in our day. We protested by staging 
demonstrations, and things went no further. 
  Governor Gonzalez explained that it is the governor's duty 
to 
preserve the people's property and physical security, which is 
what the Armed Forces are helping to do, so peace and normalcy 
can return to the area. 
  Gonzalez concluded by saying that for the time being, no 
demonstrations will be permitted.

<F P=106> [Report by Berenice Gomez Velasquez] </F>
  [Text] Defense Minister Admiral Radames Munoz Leon and 
other members of the military High Command who met with their 
Colombian counterparts returned home Wednesday night. Munoz met 
with Colombian Acting Defense Minister General Ramon Gil 
Bermudez and other ranking officers. 
  General Jose Tagliaferro D'Lima, Venezuelan Army commander, 
and General Pedro Jose Romero Farias, Venezuelan National Guard 
[NG] commander, accompanied the defense minister on the trip to 
the Colombian city of Bucaramanga. Division General Jose de la 
Cruz Pineda, chief of the Directorate of Military Intelligence 
[DIM], and Brigadier General Fernan Eurroso Fuenmayor, chief of 
Cofan [expansion unknown], were on hand to welcome the 
Venezuelan mission. These two officers worked out the details 
of the agreements on the exchange of intelligence information 
between the two armed forces based on a draft prepared by DIM. 
  The two ministers reviewed the work conducted by officers of 
the Colombian military and police forces and Venezuelan National 
Armed Forces [FAN] officers. They pledged to create a standing 
officers committee to review compliance and monitor the 
agreements signed. The committee will immediately handle any 
situation that may arise in the performance of military and 
police functions in the two countries. 
  It was reported that the Colombian military and police 
representatives created a very cordial climate, indicating that 
"not even the statements by Colombian politicians and demagogues 
would create problems in the close relations of cooperation 
between them." During the course of the meeting, the NG 
helicopter that had crashed in Colombia was returned. The 
helicopter had been held in Colombia and not one Venezuelan 
representative was allowed to witness or participate actively in 
the investigation of the crash, as the laws mandate. 
  Thus, simultaneous work by the military forces of the two 
countries will continue as it is now with each side working on 
its territory, although stress was placed on continuous exchange 
of military information to fight criminals who operate along 
Venezuela's enormous border with Colombia. 
  There was no information, much less confirmation, from the 
Colombian officers on the statement made to the media by the 
Colombian Army commander. Oddly enough, the Colombian officers 
and police chiefs did not present the list, ranks, or 
intelligence reports that reportedly demonstrate that a group of 
NG officers sold FAN weapons to Colombian guerrillas. They did 
not present a list of serial numbers of the alleged FAN weapons 
that the Colombian military had found or seized from Colombian 
guerrillas, as had been reported.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 19 Jan (NA) -- Argentine Vice Foreign 
Minister [title as received] Fernando Petrella stated that the 
ratification of the Tlatelolco Treaty by Argentina, Brazil, and 
Chile "will bring tranquillity not only to these countries but 
to the rest of the hemisphere, and to the international 
community as well." 
  Petrella stressed the system "of verification and 
transparency" signed by the three countries, and added that the 
opposite would have been "submitting Argentina to a system of 
separation and isolation that would have led it to lose the 
train of development in the nuclear area." 
  In remarks to a radio station, Petrella said the document 
ratifying the Tlatelolco Treaty by Argentina was submitted today 
in Mexico City by Foreign Policy Under Secretary Rogelio Pfirter. 
  However, so far Brazil has not ratified the treaty, although 
it had agreed with Argentina and Chile to simultaneously submit 
the documents. 
  "What happened was a little lack of synchronization, but 
Brazil will ratify the treaty, possibly in the course of the 
first quarter of this year," Petrella said. 
  The vice foreign minister denied that the Tlatelolco 
Treaty's 
ratification would reduce Argentine sovereignty in nuclear 
matters "because it is just a matter of preserving the country's 
current capacity, attained very well in the past." 
  "In this manner some situations will be whitewashed and we 
will be in a position to have access to technology that the 
National Atomic Energy Commission and the entire Argentine 
nuclear industry need," he said. 
  Petrella said: "Ukraine, which is a nuclear power, wants to 
stop being one, the same as the Czech Republic, and North Korea, 
a country with which the international community is negotiating." 
  "I would say that most countries will be members not only of 
the common agreements but of the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) 
as well, which Argentina hopes to join this year, as conveyed by 
the president," he said. 
  Petrella also stressed the "distrust" that existed among 
Argentina, Brazil, and Chile concerning the nuclear issue, 
"partly created by the origin of the Treaty for the Provision of 
Nuclear Weapons that has marked a sort of discrimination between 
those that could be nuclear powers and those that could not." 
  "Those countries that conducted a nuclear explosion before 
1967 could become members, while all other nations, some of 
which had tremendous industrial development, were left out," he 
said. 
  In that order he said: "That sort of discrimination has 
generated a distrust in countries that, in this manner, could 
not have access to technology that would allow them to use 
nuclear energy for peaceful purposes." 
  "This has demonstrated that the treaty was baseless because 
countries such as ours have broadly developed that technology 
without violating, by self-control, what the treaty prohibited," 
he said.

  [Text] As I already announced in advance, at the beginning 
of the top-level meeting between the national government and 
provincial governors being held in Chapadmalal, the Catamarca 
governor and the president of the Republic signed the fiscal 
pact. Now only Neuquen, Rio Negro, and Cordoba Provinces have 
not signed the pact yet, although it is believed that the 
forthcoming days or hours will be decisive for them to also join 
the fiscal pact. 
  The pact was signed by President Carlos Menem; the Economy 
and Public Works and Services Minister, Domingo Felipe Cavallo; 
Interior Minister Carlos Federico Ruckauf -- all of them 
representing the national government; and Catamarca Province 
Governor Arnoldo Anibal Castillo. 
  The document says that the national government is pleased 
with the decision of Catamarca Province to join the fiscal pact 
for employment, production, and growth as evidence of the will 
to adopt harmonious policies to achieve the common goal for 
national economic growth and the reactivation of the regional 
economies. These are the main subjects being discussed at the 
top-level meeting here in Chapadmalal. We will continue 
reporting from Mar del Plata concerning this important meeting 
between governors and the national cabinet that obviously is 
being headed by President Carlos Menem.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 22 Jan (NA) -- Former Colonel Mohamed 
Ali Seineldin, the mastermind of the last military uprising, has 
cautioned about the possibility of renewed social turmoil 
prompted by the current socioeconomic program, and asked for a 
change in the policy implemented in this area by the national 
government. 
  The former colonel described himself as "a soldier of our 
fatherland who did not want to shirk his responsibility." He 
championed the establishment of the Movement for National 
Identity and Ibero-American Integration (MINII) as "a 
possibility for an appropriate and genuine alternative." 
  The leader of the 3 December 1990 uprising expressed these 
ideas in a self-made interview distributed by his supporters and 
signed by former Captain Gustavo Breid Obeid, who is also under 
arrest at the Magadalena Prison and is the MINII secretary 
general. 
  Seineldin made it clear that MINII "is a patriotic movement, 
and not a partisan political movement." He rejected the claim 
that he is heading MINII, asking himself: "What kind of 
leadership may one exercise in prison?" 
  Seineldin explained: "Given the current crisis situation 
experienced by nations, arising from the decadence, corruption, 
and inability of the partisan leaderships that constantly 
jeopardize republican life, the movement must act as a 
reassurance and guarantee for continuity." 
  Seineldin also rejected any similarity with Modin [Movement 
for Dignity and Independence], headed by Aldo Rico. Describing 
Modin, Seineldin said: "By joining the `partisan game,' it will 
end up as a small party, engulfed by the `big ones' through 
negotiations, transactions, and deals." 
  Asked whether MINII's relationship with the Army might not 
be 
incompatible, Seineldin made it clear that the Army's interests 
"go well beyond individuals and the circumstances in which they 
find themselves." He emphasized: "There is unity and there 
will always exist unity whenever our fatherland is in jeopardy." 
  Moving on, Seineldin cautioned about the possibility of a 
repetition of the serious episodes that had occurred in Santiago 
del Estero Province "as long as the economic policy remains 
unchanged." He believes the government "is in a blind alley." 
  Seineldin said: "If the government keeps the adjustment 
policy there will be social turmoil, and if the government keeps 
this program and does not implement an adjustment, the economy 
will sink. The only possibility is to definitely change the 
course, implementing a stability program, but with growth." 
  Seineldin also rejected "the balancing of accounts at the 
expense of the hunger of millions of families" and the solution 
"of reinstating economic anarchy." He called attention on the 
existence of "impoverished provinces because their funds are 
administrated by a central administration that 'monitors' their 
economies." 
  In conclusion, Seineldin opposed constitutional reform, 
describing it as the result of "an ill-fated maneuver right from 
the beginning, because it is based on a spurious and shameless 
pact" and because the Constitution is "something too serious to 
be changed by mere personal appetites."

  [Text] Supreme Court of Justice [CSJ] President Edgar 
Oblitas Fernandez has blamed the U.S. Government for having been 
suspended from his post and his trial by the National Congress. 
Oblitas claims that the corruption charges follow political 
interests. He said the sole objective was to remove him from 
his post. During a news conference he said: 
  [Begin Oblitas recording, in progress] ... going against 
constitutional principles, aimed at myself while I was the CSJ 
president. But I decided not to heed the measure because it was 
illegal and unconstitutional. I have now decided to deliver a 
message to the Bolivian people so that they learn the real 
reasons why the current government and Congress began this 
senseless impeachment process. This is why I ask you to inform 
the citizenry about this matter, because so far the people have 
not been told the basic issues of this case. [end recording] 
  Oblitas later reiterated that the charges against him and 
against Justice Ernesto Poppe Zubieta are not based on concrete 
evidence and thus violate the Constitution. 
  [Begin Oblitas recording] The Chamber of Deputies has 
committed an unprecedented crime by raising charges against the 
CSJ president without any concrete evidence. This can be 
written in the book of universal infamy as a monstrous example 
of how savage hatred can make men act without caring about 
destroying the honor and dignity of others in the fulfillment of 
the most [word indistinct] and insane ambitions of 
circumstantial power. 
  January 5 1994 will be remembered as a day of mourning and 
shame for Bolivian democracy because the greatest abuse against 
the Constitution and the law was committed on this date which, 
without doubt, will establish a deadly if not fatal precedent 
for this kind of abuse. 
  The whole country knows that a crime of [word indistinct] 
was 
invented as a synonym for [word indistinct] to incriminate the 
CSJ president. This crime is neither included nor described in 
the 7 November 1890 Law, which clearly describes the four types 
of malfeasance that can be committed by CSJ justices. [end 
recording]

  [Text] La Paz, 20 Jan (AFP-NA) -- The national news agency 
FIDES today reported that according to charges by Government 
Minister German Quiroga, a group of Bolivian Army men reportedly 
attempted to conspire against the stability of the democratic 
government of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, which was 
installed in August 1993. 
  The alleged military conspirators presumably had the help of 
Former Interior Minister Antonio Arguedas (1966-68) and the 
(national) prosecutor at that time, Juan Carlos Camacho, who 
have been arrested and will be arraigned before the courts 
charged with conspiracy. 
  Quiroga told FIDES that military men are presumably 
involved, 
including some high-ranking officers, who are discontent with 
the most recent list of promotions issued in December by the 
High Military Command. 
  The minister also warned that these military men, whose 
identity he did not reveal, "are going to be investigated in 
accordance with the internal military rules and regulations, in 
order to entirely clarify the case that has been the constant 
concern of the nation over the past few days." 
  The "concern" to which the minister referred relates to the 
public apparition, through the English-language weekly BOLIVIAN 
TIMES in its 23 December and 11 January issues, of a former 
sergeant named Ernesto Beltran Gardiazabal. 
  This former military man confessed that he had participated 
in the infamous attacks and political murders that occurred in 
Bolivia during the 1960's, which he attributes to the 
anticommunist "military lodges" that were active at that time, 
while also promising to provide the details known to him after 
having been assured of guarantees from the government and the 
judicial branch. 
  After the Government Ministry and the La Paz Prosecutor's 
Office offered the guarantees, the imaginary sergeant never put 
in an appearance. 
  It was then that government and military intelligence 
services began to investigate the motives behind the sudden 
reappearance of events that had occurred some 25 years ago. 
  According to Quiroga the investigation confirms that Beltran 
Gardiazabal never existed, having been invented by the 
conspirators with the help of Arguedas and Camacho "with the 
objective of destabilizing the democratic government, thus 
setting it against the Armed Forces." 
  Arguedas is a singular personality, having in 1968 become 
famous for sending Fidel Castro the hands and campaign diary of 
Ernesto Che Guevara, who had been executed in 1967 in Bolivia. 
  After many years of ostracism, Arguedas, who in general is 
considered to be a typical "double agent," reappeared on the 
political scene. 
  Quiroga told FIDES that the group of discontent military men 
finally turned to Aguedas to fabricate the "Beltran case," with 
the purpose of preparing an action to destabilize the current 
government in a confrontation with the Armed Forces.

<F P=106> [Report by Antonio Barragan; from the "Vector 21" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, presidential 
candidate of the Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD], met 
during the morning hours with students of the Acatlan 
Professional Studies Collegiate of the National Autonomous 
University of Mexico [UNAM]. Cardenas met with students from the 
Science and Humanities College during the afternoon hours. 
  During the morning meeting with the students, he said it is 
not only necessary to remove those Chiapas State high-level 
officials such as the governor or [words indistinct] but also to 
remove those state municipal presidents who it was proven have 
contrived with land owners and local bosses [caciques] to 
humiliate the Indian groups. 
  The PRD presidential candidate addressed the students of the 
Eastern Science and Humanities College during the afternoon. On 
this occasion, he said the Mexican Government had coincided for 
the first time with the PRD and its way of thinking concerning 
the arrangement of a cease-fire in Chiapas State, followed by an 
amnesty, and afterward by dealing with this issue politically. 
He said: This is the first time the government and I have 
agreed on something. 
  In expanding on this issue while addressing the students at 
a 
PRD organized meeting, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas stated: 
  [Begin Cardenas recording] If a political solution is not 
found and the state continues to believe the solution lies in 
military measures, we will be going through a long-term and 
prolonged conflict that will surely affect the country's public 
life. [end recording] 
  The PRD candidate was asked later if the presidential 
candidates should intervene in meetings planned to learn of the 
EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army] problems. In this 
respect he answered that as far as he is concerned, he is not 
going to go to where he has not been invited. He added that 
that issue is the responsibility of the coordinator appointed by 
the president of the republic to try and solve the problems of 
Chiapas.

  [Text] As the process of normalization of the situation in 
highland, jungle, and border municipalities in Chiapas State 
progresses, most Army troops remain confined to quarters near 
San Cristobal de las Casas, Oxchuc, Ocosingo, Altamirano, and 
Las Margaritas, apart from Army troops stationed at the military 
installations of Rancho Nuevo and Comitan. This situation has 
permitted civilian authorities to carry out their normal 
activities and direct their efforts to provide humanitarian 
assistance to the population. 
  Soldiers continue to assist the civilian population by 
transporting and distributing supplies, blankets, and medicine 
to the affected towns. These actions are also being carried out 
freely by different social groups, the Red Cross, and 
nongovernment organizations. 
  The Army will continue to participate in these humanitarian 
tasks and will assist civil institutions and organizations that 
require its assistance.

  [Text] Chilpancingo (Mexico), 20 Jan (EFE) -- Police have 
deployed a large number of their men in Guerrero State in view 
of the reported appearance of armed groups in mountain areas in 
this southern Mexican state, located some 250 km from the 
country's capital. 
  According to the local press, about 450 State Judicial 
Police 
(PJE) carried out seven simultaneous operations in different 
areas and in one of them they were attacked by armed men 
presumed to be guerrillas. No casualties were reported. 
Unofficially it was learned that the operations were conducted 
when the police heard about the presence of armed groups in some 
parts of the state, although PJE spokesman Gustavo Castanon told 
EFE that "these are only routine operations." 
  The policemen carried out patrols in the villages of San 
Luis 
Acatlan, Cutzamala, Papanoa, and San Luis Loma. In the two last 
villages an armed group fired upon official vehicles, without 
injuring anyone, according to the newspaper reports. In San 
Luis Acatlan police arrested three persons and charged them with 
armed robbery. High caliber weapons were seized. 
  A group of Guerrero State lawyers said that in the event 
that 
guerrilla groups appear in that state, none of the public 
security organizations have the capability or information to 
confront them. They agreed that to confront the armed groups it 
was necessary to form a special information network that did not 
depend on the Judicial Police, but the Government Secretariat 
instead. 
  At the beginning of the 1970's the country's first guerrilla 
groups were formed in the mountains in Guerrero State: the 23 
September Communist League and the Revolutionary Armed Movement 
headed by Lucio Cabanas and Arturo Gamiz. 
  Following the Chiapas State armed uprising, when on 1 
January 
the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) rose up in arms 
against the government, surveillance has increased to other 
areas that suffer serious social backwardness. Guerrero State, 
in addition to Oaxaca and Chiapas States, is a state with a 
large Indian population and also one of the most affected by 
violence due to extreme poverty and backwardness.

  [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari met this evening 
at Los Pinos, the presidential palace, with representatives of 
118 peasant and Indian organizations from Chiapas. Here is what 
President Salinas said: 
  [Begin Salinas recording] We need peace in the highlands and 
in the jungles so that justice can progress. Particularly now 
that we have made a commitment, may no one pretend to return to 
situations of the past. Rather, what we are seeking, which in 
effect has been set out here, is willingness on the part of the 
authorities to serve through their organizations, to respect 
human rights so that progress can be made in the democratic 
system and justice can be fostered. This is the commitment that 
has been made. [end recording] 
  Chiapas peasants and Indians presented some of the region's 
problems to President Salinas and gave him their opinions on the 
Chiapas conflict. They said that the armed conflict is a sign 
of the poverty and social backwardness in which the people of 
Chiapas live. 
  [Begin recording] [Peasant Antonio Hernandez] Peace will 
always be a means to achieve high values in a new human 
relationship that will produce liberty, democracy, and social 
justice. We believe we have made a great deal of progress in 
the last few days since you organized the consulting commission. 
The social organizations are currently convinced that the road 
to solving the people's problems is through dialogue and 
consensus. 
  [Felix Corozo, Indian community leader] We believe that 
peace 
for the Chiapas peasants should begin in the homes of the 
Chiapas community. We need to have decent living conditions, 
enough food, health services, and assurances that our children 
will attend school and get a good education for the future. We 
want peace that leads to infrastructure projects. We want peace 
that brings justice for all and on equal terms. We want peace 
that represents tranquility on the roads to our fields. We want 
peace to go to our coffee fields, peace to go to our bean and 
corn fields. 
  [Lazarno Hernandez, agricultural union leader] We know that 
those who made those decisions were following orders and they 
believed there was no other road to take. They believed that 
with force they would gain their freedom; they believed their 
movement was nationalistic. We combated those ideas. We told 
them there were many ways to take up the struggle within the law 
and within democracy. We told the that weapons do not free us 
from poverty nor from ignorance. We told them that the Mexican 
people did not want war, but rather peace. [end recording] 
  They all pointed out to President Salinas that the way to 
solve the people's problems is through dialogue and consensus. 
Therefore, a commitment has been made to hold a meeting next 
weekend during which pacification of the area will be fostered. 
Carlos Rojas, secretary of social development, and Beatriz 
Paredes Rangel, president of the National Commission for the 
Overall Development of and Social Justice for Indian Peoples, 
accompanied President Salinas during the meeting. Likewise, 
Enrique Del Val, under secretary of social development; 
Guillermo Espinosa, director of the National Indian Institute; 
and Arturo Warman, agrarian ombudsman, were present at this 
meeting at Los Pinos.

  [Text] Mexico City, 21 Jan (DPA) -- "Why do we have to ask 
for a pardon? For not starving? For not silencing our misery? 
These are questions asked by "Sub-Commander Marcos," 
spokesperson for the Zapatist National Liberation Front (EZLN), 
reacting in a public letter to the amnesty offered by President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
  The letter sent to the independent newspapers LA JORNADA, EL 
FINANCERO, EL TIEMPO of San Cristobal de las Casas, and the 
magazine PROCESO contains 50 questions regarding the president's 
amnesty offer which was approved this morning by the Chamber of 
Deputies. 
  "Marcos," whose real identity is unknown, wore a ski cap 
during the 1 January occupation of San Cristobal de las Casas 
and has signed off on all the communiques issued thus far by the 
EZLN directorate. "What will they pardon us for? What do we 
have to ask pardon for? For not having humbly accepted the 
gigantic historic charge of rejection and abandonment? For 
rising up in arms when we found all other paths closed? These 
are some of the questions asked by the mysterious guerrilla 
leader. "For showing the rest of the country and the world that 
human dignity is still alive even in its poorest inhabitants? 
For being mostly Indians? For struggling for liberty, 
democracy, and justice? For not following the patterns of the 
previous guerrillas? For not surrendering? For not selling 
ourselves? 
  Who must ask for pardon and who can grant it? Those who for 
years and years have sat down at a full table and have sated 
themselves, while we sat down with death, on a daily basis, so 
near that we ceased fear it. 
  Those who filled our pockets and souls with statements and 
promises? Those who are dead, our dead, so mortally dead of 
"natural" death, that is, of measles, whooping cough, dengue, 
cholera, typhoid fever, tetanus, pneumonia, malaria, and other 
gastrointestinal and pulmonary ailments? 
  Those who tortured us, arrested us, assassinated and 
despised 
us for the serious "crime" of wanting a piece of land, not a 
large piece, not a small piece, only a piece that could allow 
one to grow something to put into one's mouth. Who has to ask 
for pardon and who can grant it?."

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Senate, with the sole abstention of the Party of 
the Democratic Revolution, PRD, approved on 21 January an 
amnesty law for armed transgressors operating in Chiapas State: 
  [Begin unidentified reporter recording] The Mexican Chamber 
of Deputies and Chamber of Senators made an important 
contribution to peace in Chiapas by approving on 21 January an 
amnesty bill submitted by the federal chief executive. 
  The Chamber of Deputies modified the original text of the 
amnesty bill. Preserving its spirit and main objective, the 
deputies made important contributions to peace in Chiapas by 
turning the amnesty bill into a broad and flexible legislation 
to pave the way for peace. 
  The core of the approved law offers amnesty to all those who 
committed crimes in relation to the violent acts in Chiapas 
between 1 and 20 January at 1500. The bill was made more 
flexible to grant amnesty to those who participated in preparing 
violent incidents during December 1993. 
  The most important change made to the approved amnesty bill 
was the authorization granted to the federal chief executive to 
establish a commission tasked with coordinating the 
implementation of this law. This is very important, because 
this commission will be authorized to establish deadlines for 
the surrender of weapons, explosives, and hostages should 
amnesty be accepted. 
  The commission for the implementation of amnesty will 
determine when and in which cases the enforcement of criminal 
proceedings and the punishment imposed will no longer be 
enforced [extinguirse las acciones penales y las sanciones 
impuestas] regarding the crimes in question. All of this is 
contingent, however, to the commission declaring the definitive 
end of hostilities. 
  Another example of flexibility is that the deputies 
eliminated from the amnesty bill a deadline for the surrender of 
weapons. Article Two originally stated that the deadline to 
surrender weapons for those who would like to take advantage of 
amnesty should be within 30 days, beginning on the date of 
publication of this law. 
  The elimination of this deadline ensures that peace 
negotiations will be surrounded by a pressure-free atmosphere 
and that the amnesty law will be applied at the right time. We 
must point out that the only party that did not vote for the 
amnesty law was the PRD, which abstained. 
  During a news conference Deputy Ricardo Valero, coordinator 
of the PRD parliamentarian bloc, said his party abstained 
because it disagrees with the terms under which the amnesty bill 
was approved although the party favors it. 
  Congress will play a very important role in the search for 
peace in Chiapas State. Besides the already approved amnesty 
law, there are plans to hold special sessions beginning the 
first half of February to modify several constitutional articles 
to wage a strong fight against poverty among Chiapas residents. 
  The holding of extraordinary congressional sessions is 
contingent upon the six political parties represented at 
Congress drafting a working agenda and identification of which 
laws and constitutional articles should be modified. There is 
already consensus on the need to go to the root of the problem. 
  For example, PAN [National Action Party] has basically 
called 
for the modification of the laws on revenues and on the budget 
of the federation for 1994 to ensure a just and real 
redistribution in the poorest regions of the country. The PRD 
demands the reform of constitutional Articles Four, 53, 73, and 
115. All political parties agree on the modification of Article 
115 of the Constitution to ensure the governments of ethnic 
groups, which have regimes based on habits and customs 
[regimenes de usos y costumbres], are recognized within the 
realm of constitutional town councils. 
  The approval of the amnesty law is the first major legal 
step 
toward attaining peace in Chiapas. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Carlos Santoya, special correspondent in the </F>
Chiapas region, from the "Vector 21" newscast] 
  [Text] The Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] issued 
communiques early this morning to announce its conditions for 
negotiations. 
  The first communique addresses who must ask for pardons and 
who can grant them. That is the title of the communique, which 
ponders why amnesty makes sense in some aspects but not in 
others and who should do the pardoning, wondering if it should 
be the peasants and Indians who for years have been humiliated 
and exploited. 
  The EZLN communique also questions wealth in Chiapas; that 
is, why there are big landowners -- people who have always had 
everything, like better food and medical services -- while there 
are Indian communities where smallpox or any other disease means 
death. The communique notes that many people sit at well served 
tables with food for all family members, while Indian and 
peasant families must sit with death at their side because death 
is their daily companion. That is why we took up arms, the 
Zapatists explain. 
  The next communique is very important. It deals with the 
amnesty bill that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has sent 
to Congress. In this document the EZLN states that some 
conditions must be met so the amnesty will be real. The 
document states that so far the Zapatists have not seen an 
original text of the bill, something they had been promised and 
which they were supposed to receive through San Cristobal de las 
Cases Bishop Samuel Ruiz from Manuel Camacho Solis, the 
commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas. 
  One of the points of the communique states: Judging from 
what we have heard in the media about the amnesty bill, we can 
only give general opinions, considering that the position toward 
amnesty is premature in the face of the current dialogue 
process, which so far has not really entered the essential phase. 
  The EZLN notes that once this phase arrives, one fundamental 
step would be to make statements available to the Zapatists in 
writing so they can be analyzed. The EZLN adds that there are 
still fierce clashes between units of the Mexican Army and the 
Zapatists. The document notes that one of the EZLN's demands 
has not been met; that is, the withdrawal of the Armed Forces to 
their quarters. 
  Today we visited some places near San Cristobal de las 
Casas, 
Chiapas, where we knew the Mexican Army had been mobilized, and 
we noticed that right now there are fewer soldiers guarding the 
city. 
  As we reported yesterday, Army elements in some sites will 
remain. Some camps will be built to provide security to the 
towns. 
  The EZLN reports that the Zapatists are not opposed to a 
dialogue. On the contrary, they say they are amenable to making 
it an increasingly open process. The communique notes that 
right now the EZLN wants some time to analyze the points of the 
amnesty. The communique states: We are open and prepared to 
negotiate. 
  There is also a third communique that is very, very, 
important. Here the EZLN acknowledges Manuel Camacho Solis, the 
special commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, as 
a valid interlocutor for these talks, an interlocutor for peace, 
as they call him. 
  In this communique they explain that Camacho Solis has 
positive characteristics for engaging in this dialogue with the 
EZLN. The communique adds that Camacho Solis has demonstrated, 
with his words and deeds, that he has goodwill and good 
intentions to reach a dialogue that could be fruitful and bring 
to Chiapas the justice it needs.

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 22 Jan (AFP) -- 
Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation 
in Chiapas, announced today his willingness to meet with the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) general command at an 
undisclosed place and time. 
  Camacho said he received a communique from the EZLN but 
would 
"give no details due to security reasons." He answered the 
communique thus: San Cristobal Bishop Samuel Ruiz and the 
commissioner "are willing to meet at the specified place. [no 
closing quotation mark as received] 
  Camacho said preparations are complete for the meeting with 
the rebel command, which told the commissioner of its intention 
to release former Chiapas Governor General Absalom Castellanos, 
who was kidnapped by the EZLN on 2 January at a ranch at Las 
Margaritas Municipality. 
  Camacho said the Zapatists made some demands in exchange for 
Gen. Castellanos' release, but he did not reveal those demands 
to avoid hindering the liberation process, which he termed a 
positive gesture from the rebels within the framework of the 
search for a negotiated political solution to the violence. 
  However, Camacho told the rebels that "Gen. Castellanos' 
exchange for people arrested in connection with the events that 
began on 1 January" requires "certain procedures, which are 
being handled" and "which must be carried out for a prompt 
solution to this negotiation." 
  Camacho referred to the amnesty law approved by Congress for 
the people involved in the guerrilla rebellion, but he explained 
that its enforcement requires that the parties to the conflict 
reach a formal cease-fire as soon as possible. 
  The government commissioner said there are still obstacles 
to 
the negotiations but he that insisted Gen. Castellanos' 
impending release is a good sign for the talks. 
  Camaco repeatedly said that security considerations 
prevented 
him from divulging any details of his meeting with the guerrilla 
leaders or about Castellanos' release, but he added that this 
"step is an important contribution to the peace process." 
  The guerrilla forces and the Mexican Army have maintained a 
cease-fire since 13 January, when the Armed Forces began to 
withdraw from rural communities in the conflict area to relocate 
in various towns and military bases. This has helped the 
parties reach a detente. 
  According to local journalists' commentaries, Camacho's and 
Ruiz' meeting with the still unknown EZLN general command could 
take place in the Lacandona jungle at a town under rebel 
control, but such reports have not been addressed by official 
sources. 
  According to previous communications between the 
commissioner 
and the rebels, the peace process will be long and difficult, 
but the two sides have expressed their wish to reach a political 
agreement as soon as possible.

  [Text] Mexico City, 21 Jan (DPA) -- According to an 
official report issued today in the capital, Mexico's National 
Human Rights Committee (CNDH) has received 138 reports of 
homicides, missing persons, illegal arrests, abuse of authority, 
torture, and solitary confinement since the guerrilla conflict 
began in southern Chiapas State. 
  The first case under investigation is the alleged summary 
execution of seven guerrilla members in the Ocosingo 
marketplace. Their guerrilla's bodies were found tied up with a 
single shot to the back of the head. 
  The commission is also working on the case of 14 people 
traveling in a minibus who were reportedly killed in a 2 January 
clash near the Rancho Nuevo barracks, approximately 12 km from 
San Cristobal. Some of the bodies showed a shot to the head. 
The commission is also investigating the deaths of four 
civilians reportedly shot by the Army two days later at the same 
place. 
  Regarding missing person cases, information indicates that 
out of 349 reported cases, 142 people remain unaccounted for. 
  The committee said it interviewed 127 prisoners and 
ascertained the injuries sustained at the time of their arrest. 
  Meanwhile, the Coordinating Board of Nongovernmental Human 
Rights Organizations, which is headquartered in San Cristobal de 
las Casas, said it had received 45 testimonies from people who 
are not involved in the conflict -- mostly Indians -- who were 
"mistreated" by the military and accused of being members of the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN). 
  The Defense Ministry announced that 20 armed, masked men 
yesterday held up two UNHCR representatives -- Isabelle Mariel 
Raeber, a Swiss citizen, and William Calderon, a Mexican -- 
taking their money and credit cards, on the highway to the 
conflict area.

  [Text] Guadalajara, 21 Jan (AFP)--The Mexican Episcopal 
Conference (CEM) today urged the "correction" of "unfair 
structures" and "abuses of power," factors that "caused" the 
misery in the State of Chiapas. In a communique published in 
Guadalajara, the bishops condemned violence and announced a 
National Drive for Peace and Justice in Chiapas to be held on 
Sunday to collect money and other contributions for people 
affected by the armed conflict. 
  The document says the Chiapas conflict "should serve as a 
warning of the inherent danger of abandoning the poor lower 
classes," and that "the misuse of riches can be an insult to the 
poverty of others. In this case, extreme poverty is caused by 
abuse of power and unjust structures that must be corrected," 
states the eight-point report prepared today. This report is 
based on a meeting held by the Catholic Church hierarchy on 10 
January to analyze the Indian rebellion unleashed in southern 
Mexico 20 days ago. 
  "We know, above all, that the extreme poverty, abandonment, 
and scorn under which the peasants and Indians of Chiapas and 
other areas live are the roots of the violence that has erupted" 
says the CEM. In this sense, "we believe the economic system 
rising from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) must 
keep in mind the needs of the peasants and the Indians and 
promote a more humane economy", the bishops added. 
  The bishops deny church involvement in the rebellion, which 
according to initial government reports had the support of 
"priests and catechists" in the area, including Samuel Ruiz, the 
bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas. Ruiz immediately denied 
the charges and condemned the methods used by the Zapatist 
National Liberation Army (EZLN). "We cannot allow any suspicion 
to fall upon our clergymen, priests, or the bishop himself. We 
know he has always condemned violence," stressed the episcopal 
communique. 
  After pronouncing itself in favor of a negotiated solution 
to 
the armed conflict, the CEM said it would be "reprehensible if 
the Mexican Army were to transgress while in pursuit of its 
duties," and asked that the "civilian population be respected, 
arbitrary acts not be committed when searching for the guilty, 
and that prisoners be treated" according to international rules. 
  The bishops also appealed to "businessmen, landowners, 
cattlemen, and all those who influence life in Chiapas," asking 
them for "actions to alleviate the poor," since extreme poverty 
is "completely opposed to God's plan."

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina </F>
in Windhoek, Namibia, by Radio Rebelde journalist Jose Mejia in 
Havana -- live] 
  [Text] [Mejia] We now have a line with Windhoek, capital of 
Namibia, where Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina is on the 
last leg of his tour through five African countries. Miss, the 
connection please. 
  [Operator] Sir? 
  [Mejia] Yes. 
  [Operator] Yes, we now have the line with the capital of 
Namibia. 
  [Mejia] Good. 
  [Operator] Cuban Minister Roberto Robaina is on the line. 
[To 
Robaina:] This is a call from Cuba. Go ahead, both of you. 
  [Mejia] Yes, thank you very much, Miss. 
  Mr. Foreign Minister, good evening. We are on the air, live, 
for the "Exclusive" program and all of Cuba, over our radio 
station Radio Rebelde. How are you? 
  [Robaina] Well, very well. No problems whatsoever. 
  [Mejia] Comrade Foreign Minister, we want to know about the 
continuation of the dialogue begun today by yourself and 
Namibian Foreign Affairs Minister Theo-Ben Guribab, a dialogue 
you two began at the 48th UN General Assembly, and especially 
what subjects were broached in these official talks. 
  [Robaina] Well, indeed, Mejia, we arrived in Windhoek just a 
few hours ago. I think we are carrying out a program that, 
happily, is already the, let us say, final part of the tour 
through these countries of Africa. But I think it has special 
significance, precisely because it has to do with this 
territory, Namibia, in particular -- which is so closely linked 
to the history of our country and to the presence of our Cuban 
troops in Angola, troops who made a modest contribution to the 
independence of this territory. 
  I think it constitutes a privilege for everyone accompanying 
me, and from the point of view....[rephrases] For me personally, 
the land that (?can still be seen) from the border, to have the 
privilege and possibility of seeing it and treading it with 
one's own compatriots. [sentence as heard] And I think that has 
been, without a doubt, a meeting of special significance -- just 
as this people's respect and admiration has been special from 
the beginning, the respect and admiration of the ministers with 
whom I have already met. 
  I have seen....[rephrases] I have begun the official talks 
with the Foreign Ministry, but I have also already contacted the 
ministers of Interior, Sports, Education, and Industry. That is, 
we have already made contact with several of them; and in all of 
them we can see, in the first place, a deep tie, a tie that is 
sincere and based on the historic relations that Cubans and 
Namibians have always had. 
  I think...[rephrases] a very broad agenda was discussed 
today, which has to do with the medical collaboration that 
already exists, with the cooperation...[rephrases] the 
collaboration in the sphere of education proper. We just signed 
an bilateral foreign ministry agreement today, and we prepared 
the signing of a trade agreement, which will be signed in the 
next few hours. 
  The meetings with the ministers of Health, Commerce, 
Tourism, 
and Sports continue tomorrow; and the meeting with the president 
is scheduled for 21 January, before departure. 
  I have just now visited, at the places where they work, the 
physicians who are providing services here, too, within a system 
of compensated cooperation [colaboracion compensada]. There are 
14 of them established in Windhoek, the capital; and the other 
40-some-odd are in the regions more distant from the center, 
(?from) the capital. And tomorrow night I am meeting with the 
entire Cuban group here, after I finish up the entire program 
with the Namibians that I have scheduled for the day. 
  [Mejia] Well, Comrade Minister, I would so much like to know 
if there is a possibility of your summing up for us your trip 
through the Dark Continent, through these five African 
countries; and whether or not the objectives of this trip have 
been fulfilled thus far. 
  [Robaina] I feel that, even though there are a few hours 
left before finishing, we can perfectly well sum up: It is an 
exceptional opportunity to encounter a part of our history. I 
have, from the first days, found a profound gratitude on the 
part of the Africans in all the countries for what Cuba has done 
for them. I insist that Cuba is today a nation, and it is the 
nation that lives, resists, and works thanks to, among other 
things, what the Africans contributed to us in the formation of 
that Cuban patriotism and that nationality that exist in our 
land. Therefore, not only are we collecting expressions of 
gratitude; we, too, are expressing to this Dark Continent what 
we Cubans owe to it, especially as regards the formation of the 
Cuban nation. 
  This has been an exceptional opportunity to speak of our 
historic relations; but we have said that in order to remain 
faithful to those historic relations, we must, above all, make 
history at the present time. And to make history in our 
relations at the present time is to find the adequate, proper, 
current level that corresponds to our relations with Africa 
under these new circumstances. 
  The situation is new for the world. The situation is new for 
Africa. The situation is new for the countries I have visited 
and for our country as well. But I think we will be far more 
faithful to our history if, under such difficult circumstances, 
we are capable of being faithful to the principles that have 
always characterized these relations. Above all else, we have 
found a space for communication, a space for understanding, and 
a space for exchanges. I do not believe in strictly political 
diplomacy. I believe that in these times, our country's 
diplomacy must seek space for the greatest problem we have: 
economic reintegration into a truly difficult, complex, and 
changing world. 
  [Mejia] Comrade Minister, I want to thank you for this time 
you have given Radio Rebelde. I would also like to invite you to 
join us here at our studio when you get back to the country. 
  [Robaina] Thank you. I truly appreciate the opportunity you 
have given us to keep the people informed of what we are doing. 
I have said before and I repeat: Even though our work here is 
difficult and involves pressures, nothing can be more difficult 
and pressuring than what our people, whom we miss so much, do 
morning, noon, and night. 
  [Mejia] This was a live telephone interview with Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina on the last leg of his tour in 
Windhoek, Namibia. Foreign Minister Robaina is now concluding a 
five-country tour of Africa.

  [Text] The governments of Cuba and Namibia today in 
Windhoek signed an important commercial agreement granting each 
other favored-nation treatment. The three-year agreement was 
signed by Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina and Namibian 
Trade and Industry Minister Hidipo Hamutenya. The agreement 
states that the signing countries will make all payments in 
freely convertible currency and in accordance with the laws of 
the two countries. Robaina and Hamutenya agreed that the 
bilateral agreement will open the way for identifying other 
areas of cooperation. 
  The Cuban foreign minister today concludes his three-day 
official visit to Namibia, the last leg of his two-week tour of 
Africa, during which he visited Ghana, Angola, Zimbabwe, and 
Zambia. Before leaving Namibia, Foreign Minister Robaina will 
meet with Namibian President Sam Nujoma.

  [Text] Namibian President Sam Nujoma today met with Cuban 
Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, whose two-week tour of African 
countries ended in Windhoek. A PRENSA LATINA dispatch explains 
that in a climate of friendship, the two leaders came out in 
favor of strengthening the movement of nonaligned countries and 
increasing South-South cooperation. 
  Nujoma termed the U.S. blockade against Cuba unfair behavior 
that lacks justification since the end of the Cold War. He 
stressed that the peoples of Namibia and Cuba have much in 
common. 
  Windhoek and Havana signed an important trade agreement 
Friday. After having met with Roberto Robaina, whose African 
tour also included Ghana, Angola, Zimbabwe, and Zambia, 15 
Namibian businessmen will be traveling to Havana soon to explore 
investment possibilities.

<F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program, with host Juan Carlos Roque Garcia </F>
and guest journalist Renato Recio of the newspaper TRABAJADORES] 
  [Text] [Roque] Greetings, friends. We are talking straight 
today, here on Radio Rebelde, with journalist Renato Recio of 
the newspaper TRABAJADORES. The topic: the workers assemblies 
that are being held the length and breadth of Cuba. Renato? 
  [Recio] Well, the assemblies are not yet being held 
throughout the country. Forgive me for contradicting you. 
  [Roque] Yes, but they are indeed being held, in the sense 
that the pilot assemblies have been held in all provinces. That 
is why I say that these assemblies are already covering almost 
the entire country. 
  [Recio] The process is now beginning; and, especially, what 
is called the preparation of the union cadres is beginning in 
order to improve the process of holding the meetings that have 
come to be called Parliament in the Workplace. So, by chance -- 
or rather, not by chance; because of my job, of course -- I 
attended yesterday the cadre-preparation assembly in Matanzas. 
And, well, to a certain extent, I have some fresh ideas, fresh 
suggestions regarding this matter, which is a very important one. 
  [Roque] Comrade Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National 
Assembly of the People's Government, participated in that 
assembly. 
  [Recio] As did Pedro Ross, secretary general of the Cuban 
Workers Federation. Both were there the whole time, and they 
were very interested; and, well, they talked, participated, made 
important statements. 
  In any case Juan Carlos, I am not going to try to report on 
that, which is a bit of news that has already been reported this 
morning in various media; but, rather, I am going to think a 
little, reflect a little, on this matter of the assemblies -- 
which as you know are on Cuba's financial problem, on the 
nation's situation -- which is quite critical from the financial 
point of view. 
  And, initially, I would like to think about this matter that 
is being spoken of: how the measures will represent a certain 
amount of sacrifice. They are measures that need to be 
understood, and they are not measures the majority will find 
pleasant. Not at all. 
  [Roque] Is that why this popular consultation is being held? 
  [Recio] Of course, because a consensus is being sought. What 
is being sought is, let us say, for everyone to aspire to the 
same thing, despite the fact that there is a certain measure of 
sacrifice involved. However, I want to reflect upon this aspect: 
Is it a matter of a real sacrifice or of a sacrifice that is 
only apparent? 
  I say this without having a conclusive answer to this 
question -- simply because I think that if through these 
measures the peso recovers, and if through these measures 
salaries also recover, then the problem is not how many pesos I 
lose through any other measure, such as, let us say, prices, 
taxes, etc. Rather, the question is how much can I acquire with 
the pesos I have, that is, with the salary that I receive. And 
then we see that an action can either be a sacrifice or not. It 
depends. If we recover the value of the peso, if the buying 
power of the salary is recovered, then we will all feel we are 
benefiting. 
  [Roque] However, here what we call the equilibrium between 
supply and demand comes into play. 
  [Recio] Exactly. 
  [Roque] Such equilibrium does not exist at the present time. 
  [Recio] Exactly. What we have at present is a big imbalance, 
that is, a very low supply and an excessive, solvent -- 
expressed in money -- demand. And in this connection, since you 
are talking to me about this, I find it interesting that now, at 
this Parliament in the Workplace, there are two aspects. There 
are two well-defined aspects, and the assembly also has to take 
into account equilibrium as regards these two aspects. 
  Look. First of all, there is the fact that being discussed 
at 
the different work centers is the economic and financial 
situation of the work center itself, of that very place itself. 
And thus one has to notice how the costs are running; how the 
billing and paying among the different enterprises is done; 
whether or not there is an excess of personnel; whether 
resources are being diverted, whether there is any disorder in 
that regard; to what extent the place is being subsidized; to 
what extent that subsidy can be decreased; etc. And I want to 
tell you, Juan Carlos, that that aspect is of the utmost 
importance, even when the other aspect, which I am going to 
describe for you next, seems to be more sensational, seems to be 
more pleasant. 
  [Roque] Well, let's pause a moment, and then we will 
describe 
that other aspect, here on the Straight Talk program. 
  [Roque] We have with us today journalist Renato Recio of 
the newspaper TRABAJADORES, with whom we will be discussing 
workers assemblies -- that is, this so-called workers parliament 
-- which are to take place throughout Cuba, and which are at the 
present time being held, more or less as pilot assemblies, at 
several important work centers, within various important sectors 
of the economy. 
  [Recio] I was saying that there are two important points. I 
already mentioned the first one. I repeat: The first point is 
the economic and financial situation of the very work center in 
question; and the second, which I said was perhaps more 
sensational. People are tempted to devote more time to this 
point. But the other one is very important. 
  [Roque] Yes, of course. 
  [Recio] It has to do with discussing and proposing possible 
financial measures of a general nature to reduce the budget 
deficit and excess liquidity that exists in the streets, in 
society. Now, these two points, both of them, have to do with 
economic and financial streamlining, because, as you recalled, 
there is a problem of imbalance between supply and demand. I 
will myself give a brief explanation, if you will so allow. 
  [Roque] Yes. 
  [Recio] That enormous excess of circulating currency, 
calculated at some 11 billion pesos, has been rising because of 
the imbalance between supply and demand. Everyone knows what 
supply is. It is the products, the articles, the services that 
people consume or enjoy, and which they buy. Now demand is 
expressed in the amount of money that people have, with which to 
acquire those products and services. What is happening now is 
that the supply is extremely limited, while the demand is 
gigantic. The ideal thing, and everyone realizes this, would be 
to resolve the imbalance by having a larger supply. That is, for 
there to be more products, more things to buy, more services to 
offer. That, of course, is solved through more work, more 
production, with the entire economy functioning properly, 
harmoniously. 
  [Roque] Indisputably. Work creates wealth. And through work, 
only through work, through sacrifice, through serious 
production, can we get out, to a great extent, of this rut we 
are in. 
  [Recio] However, -- and this must be clear -- the supply 
cannot at present be increased, abruptly, or quickly because, in 
the first place, Cuba has no external financing. 
  [Roque] Of course. 
  [Recio] It is well known that we are in our current crisis 
due to external causes. 
  [Roque] Nor can we recover immediately. 
  [Recio] No, we cannot do that either, because we lack hard 
currency. We have little hard currency, so we can provide little 
input to make our factories and service centers produce. In 
addition to this, there is this same business of excess monetary 
liquidity, a factor that, as everyone knows, does not exactly 
contribute to recovery. It is a factor that contributes instead 
to labor indiscipline, lack of spirit, and lack of incentive to 
work. We therefore must solve this problem of excessive amounts 
of circulating currency in order to seriously aspire to economic 
recovery for the nation. In that connection, I think the 
assemblies are making their opinions strongly known. 
  [Roque] I believe that these base-level assemblies somewhat 
enhance the analysis of concrete aspects. In other words, the 
base level is itself seeking to solve problems at the level 
where responsibility for production exists. This is an important 
aspect of this entire debate, which will be conducted throughout 
the country. 
  [Recio] In addition, we know there is room for efficiency 
everywhere. Unfortunately, as everybody knows, our efficiency 
dropped not only in the last few years; it was an ongoing 
process which gave rise to the rectification process. There was 
a process of decline in efficiency. Therefore, since we have and 
have had low efficiency, there is room for improvement. The 
problem now is to exploit our reserves, bring to them to light 
despite the difficult situation. 
  [Roque] How can we encourage this? 
  [Recio] The workers know what is happening. An experienced 
worker knows what is being done at his work center. He knows 
what should and should not be done. If we can again create an 
economic awareness among the workers, if we can create a 
political and moral awareness among the workers, we can increase 
production and reduce expenditures. This would be a great 
contribution to the streamlining of our economy. 
  [Roque] I agree. I also believe that this process of 
encouragement, when the worker is being asked to produce more, 
must also take something important into consideration: We must 
create the minimum conditions in which the workers can produce. 
Many times this is not done because someone does not want to. 
The special period is blamed for many things that can [5-second 
break in reception] workers. 
  [Recio] Without overlooking that there are many problems 
that 
are caused by the situation we are experiencing. 
  [Roque] Problems caused by inefficiency, by negligence. 
  [Recio] There are other problems that we must attack. These 
are problems caused by inefficiency and negligence. These are 
problems caused because people do not want to work. 
  [Roque] These problems affect the situation we are talking 
about. 
  [Recio] We spoke earlier about the meetings being held at 
the 
work centers. At those meetings they are discussing the problems 
that arise as a result of excess currency. If we were to adopt 
the overall measures suggested, they would only serve to alter 
the consequences; however, the reason for the problem is in the 
inefficiency at the work centers. 
  [Roque] TRABAJADORES reporter Renato Recio is here with us 
on 
"Straight Talk." We have three minutes left to analyze what we 
have talked about on this program. 
  [Recio] As I have already said, we cannot ignore the 
importance of the first point. Each work center must discuss its 
own problems. I believe this is more important than discussing 
whether prices go up or not, whether this or that product is 
taxed, whether we should seize the money the hoarders have. 
  Now regarding the measures, we must not only listen to the 
workers' ideas, but also the suggestions they are making. Many 
of these suggestions are very good. For example, a suggestion 
made by La Corona Cigar Factory workers is very good. I believe 
it is a logical measure and worthy of discussion. The workers 
suggested that sick leave be restricted to a specific number of 
days a year. You may recall that back in the days of capitalism, 
some companies paid for nine days of sick leave a year and 
anyone who was sick for more than nine days had no rights 
whatsoever. 
  [Roque] I agree with you that it is a suggestion that should 
be studied. However, there are some people who have certain 
illnesses for which nine days' sick leave would just not be 
enough. If this system were implemented, then the worker would 
not be taken care of.... 
  [Recio, interrupts] No. 
  [Roque] No? Then explain it to me. Explain this to me 
because 
I am against that measure. 
  [Recio] The suggestion does not specify nine days. The 
suggestion does not specify the number of sick-leave days. 
However, if a worker is sick for longer than the authorized 
number of sick-leave days, then he will be covered by social 
security. If this suggestion was adopted, we would put an end to 
the problem of the medical certificates. Anyone can get a 
medical certificate. You can get them wholesale. Everyone uses 
medical certificates. Everyone has a friend or relative who is a 
doctor who can get the certificates. It is really a mess. 
  [Roque] I have to agree with you on this, but we have to 
study this well. We must protect the rights of the worker. 
  [Recio] I agree. Now that we are at the end of the program, 
we can emphatically state that the goal of the labor and social 
laws is to help those who need help. In our system if you need 
help you will get help. What we must avoid is people using the 
paternalistic laws to rob the other workers and the country as 
well. 
  I do believe the suggestion is good. If the worker does not 
take any sick leave in a year, he will be paid for those days. 
In other words, the worker will be rewarded for not taking sick 
leave. Many times workers do not show up for work for reasons 
other than illness. They have a headache and they do not go to 
work. Take an aspirin and in approximately 30 minutes you will 
be rid of the headache. But you know what that is like. 
  The idea is not to help for the sake of helping. The idea is 
to help those who truly need help. 
  [Roque] I believe that people, people who have always 
supported the Revolution, know what they want and are capable of 
studying the appropriate measures during the parliaments and in 
the workplace. 
  [Recio] I agree with you. 
  [Roque] Renato Recio was our guest on this program.

<F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program with host Juan Carlos Roque Garcia </F>
and guest, BOHEMIA reporter Luis Sexto -- live] 
  [Text] [Roque] Good afternoon friends. This is the Straight 
Talk program and our guest today is BOHEMIA reporter Luis Sexto. 
What has Cuba invested its money in throughout these past 35 
years? That is the question we will answer during today's 
program. 
  [Sexto] Juan Carlos, it is not necessary for us to talk 
about 
or defend the work done by the Revolution. I have always 
believed that because of its magnitude, the work done by the 
Revolution defends itself. It is so evident that perhaps it is 
not necessary to defend the work that throughout the past 35 
years, the Cuban revolutionary process has carried out for the 
good of the country and for the good of the Cuban people. 
  The situation we are experiencing today demerits -- demerits 
is not the most appropriate term, but we will use it -- the work 
of the Revolution. The things we lack, the crisis, the 
deterioration of the country's material life, for reasons 
everyone is aware of such as the U.S. blockade and the collapse 
of the Socialist bloc, have all contributed to paralyzing some 
of the work of the Revolution. All of the reasons mentioned 
above have contributed to the fact that the Cuban people are not 
fully enjoying the work of the Revolution as they did through 
1989. 
  [Roque] But the work is there; it is present. 
  [Sexto] It is there. 
  [Roque] The work of the Revolution is present in every 
sphere 
of our life. It is important that we remember this. 
  [Sexto] Yes, it is important. That is what I am going to do. 
I am going to remember, or rather, let us all remember all that 
the Revolution has done. 
  A few weeks ago we were saying that there are different ways 
to view the Cuban situation. We talked about people who viewed 
the situation as anguishing, uncertain, as the end. They viewed 
our situation in a negative and pessimistic manner. There are 
others who quite consciously undermine the work of the 
Revolution. These people purposefully wish to damage the 
Revolution. These are our internal enemies who echo the feelings 
of our foreign enemies. 
  [Roque] They are the ones asking what the money has been 
invested in during the past years. 
  [Sexto] They are not the only ones asking themselves that 
question. The same question is asked by the person who is 
afraid, who thinks that all is lost, the person who views the 
situation as uncertain. In his desperation, that person also 
asks himself that same question. He asks himself: Where did the 
money go? He says: This country is in ruins. That is not true, 
this country is not in ruins. This country has done things for 
the people. Everyday we see things that the country has done and 
we see where investments were made over the past 35 years. This 
is what I wish to discuss. 
  Even though you and I may agree on various matters, we both 
know that "Straight Talk" is a program on which a difference of 
opinion can be expressed. In one way or another we are offering 
the views of the listener. 
  [Roque] There are times when our views are completely 
different. 
  [Sexto] And that is good. That is the way I feel. 
  Well, going back to the people we were talking about. They 
are experiencing a situation similar to that of a person who 
looks at himself in the mirror and only sees poverty, misery. 
The person, who looks and sees only poverty and misery and never 
sees something positive, will despair. We must realize that when 
we look at ourselves in the mirror we must remember that behind 
that mirror there is something more. We must remember that the 
mirror is not only poverty and misery. We must remember there is 
something more behind it. If we do not see this, we will 
despair, we will be defeated. I do believe that in the country 
there is much more behind the mirror than we can see or imagine. 
  [Roque] Our guest today is BOHEMIA reporter Luis Sexto. We 
are talking about the work done by the Revolution in the past 35 
years. 
  [Sexto] Juan Carlos, when the program began, I said that I 
did not feel it necessary to mention all that the Revolution has 
done or to defend what it has done. Any person who wants to see 
has only to tour the country and see all the work done. It is 
like a monument built throughout the length and width -- that is 
if Cuba has width; it is so long and narrow that I always have 
my doubts when I say length and width -- of the country. 
  For example, the average life span of the Cuban citizen is 
75 
years. That is the work of the Revolution. You are seeing the 
work of the Revolution when you see our illiteracy rate at 
barely zero. When you see that 95 percent of the country has 
electricity -- even though we are currently experiencing outages 
-- you see the work of the Revolution. You do not have to make a 
great effort to see what the Revolution has done. 
  [Roque] And that money was used to make these works 
possible. 
  [Sexto] That is correct. In what has Cuba invested all the 
money it made in the past 35 years? Right now I do not have the 
figures, but I would say that Cuba has invested more than $50 
billion to build its material infrastructure over the past 35 
years. And I am just giving you an amount that I think could be 
in the range of what has been spent. Please note that I am only 
talking about investing in the material and industrial 
infrastructure of the country. 
  [Roque] But the Revolution has invested in much more than 
that material infrastructure you are talking about. You also 
mentioned earlier that the Revolution invested in education and 
health. I wonder how much has been spent in building new 
hospitals, new schools. I wonder how much has been invested to 
create the necessary conditions to ensure progress in the 
country. 
  [Sexto] That is correct. But before we continue to discuss 
the main topic on this program, I would like to talk a bit about 
the way some people are viewing our life, our situation. I want 
to bring this up again because I did not make myself very clear 
when I talked about it earlier. When we look in the mirror we 
see something we do not like. We do not have some of the things 
we need, and we are all suffering because of this. There is a 
clash between the things we need and what we can get. There is 
always a difference between what we want and what we have. 
  [Roque] We cannot ignore that truth. 
  [Sexto] There are things that bother everyone. The black 
market, for example. The other day Pepe Alejandro [Jose 
Alejandro Rodriguez] and you were talking about this. This 
morning, on my way to the studios, on "L" Street someone offered 
me Canadian chicken at $2 a pound. I ask myself: Is that Cuba? 
Does the man who is offering me Canadian chicken at $2 a pound 
represent the true image of my country? He was a young man. 
Does he truly represent our country's youth? 
  The other day some Argentine tourists were telling us, you 
were there when they were complaining about it, that some youths 
came up to them at the hotel and complained about the situation 
and the Revolution. We told them that they did not represent 
our youth. The youths who stick around the hotels do not 
represent our youth. Our youths are those who ride their 
bicycles 14 km to get to the Jose Antonio Chavarria University, 
where they are studying for a career; our youths are those who 
are part of the Youth Labor Army, who are at the agricultural 
camps in Havana, Pinar del Rio, or the eastern sector of our 
country as part of the Turquino Plan. Those are the youths who 
represent our country. 
  There are things that bother us, things that are not nice, 
but they are all the result of the crisis. Three years ago this 
country imported $8 billion in goods. Today it can only import 
$1.1 or $1.2 billion. There is no doubt this country is 
experiencing an anguishing and critical material situation. You 
do not have to be very bright to understand this. This 
situation unleashes certain types of reaction. This situation 
creates certain attitudes and feelings. These reactions, 
attitudes, and feelings can only be changed by us. 
  [Roque] Many of these feelings are only temporary. 
  [Sexto] Temporary. 
  [Roque] Many times we get home and find that there is no gas 
for cooking, that there is no electricity, or there is simply 
nothing to cook. At that moment you forget everything and begin 
to get mad and even fight. 
  [Sexto] But deep down, these things do not change most of 
the 
people's support for the Revolution. 
  [Roque] That is right. 
  [Sexto] It is quite normal to feel irritated. It is quite 
natural to air that irritation. If I do not have gas to cook 
with, I will get mad. That is normal. However, I am sure that 
if that same citizen who today is upset because he has no gas, 
if asked to choose between the Cuban Revolution and the 
capitalism we are being offered from Miami, he would not 
hesitate to choose the Cuban Revolution. The Cuban Revolution 
gave that citizen something that capitalism never gave the 
country. 
  [Roque] That something we are talking about on Radio 
Rebelde. 
In conclusion, Luis Sexto will summarize his opinion on today's 
topic. 
  [Sexto] Briefly, what can we say? Juan Carlos, just look 
at the investment in the field of hydraulics in this country. 
How much has the Revolution invested? In 1959 we only had two, 
three, or four dams. Today we have 180 big dams and 
approximately 800 micro dams. We have experienced considerable 
hydraulic development that guarantees water for agriculture. 
  We can also talk about science. We can say that today Cuba 
has unique products such as the meningitis vaccine. Despite the 
problems we are having to get the vaccine on the Latin American 
market, it is already being used in Latin America to save lives. 
  We can also say that the Revolution has doubled and 
modernized the sugar industry, Cuba's traditional industry. 
Most of the country's 156 sugar mills have been improved. 
Their milling capacity was increased and technology improved. 
That is the work of the Revolution. 
  [Roque] A new sugar mill was built. 
  [Sexto] Not one, several. 
  [Roque] Several yes, but one was built when the situation 
was 
getting worse. 
  [Sexto] Cuba has developed its mechanical industry, which is 
now capable of building 70 percent of a sugar mill in the 
country. That is the work of the Revolution. Cuba has been able 
to base its policy of social wellbeing for the entire country on 
its industrial and material infrastructure. What else can be 
said? We could also talk about the development of the 
pharmaceutical industry. 
  [Roque] We should specify, that there are areas where we 
have 
not been able to satisfy the need of the population. 
  [Sexto] Of course, Cuba had not concluded its plan for 
developing its strategic plan when this unbalance in the world 
arrived. It came at a time when Cuba was half way through its 
plan for development. There were many things that were still to 
be done, and there are still many things to be done. No one can 
deny that considerable work has been done which is the guarantee 
that we can overcome the special period or the crisis we are 
facing. If we had not had this project, if we had not had the 
pharmaceutical, sugar, nickel, and citrus industries, if we had 
not had a developed agriculture with developed technologies and 
research centers... 
  [Roque] If we did not have all this we could not think about 
an exit. 
  [Sexto] Yes, but since we have all this, we can think about 
an exit. Undoubtedly, the exit, in my opinion, is certain 
because we have a base and we are not naked. We lack many things 
but the country is not naked or crippled. That is what I am 
referring to. I am not justifying things. I believe we cannot 
justify the past. What was done wrongly was done wrongly. We can 
explain them but we cannot justify them. As a Spanish writer 
once said, we can only justify the future. We are struggling so 
our future can be justified and so it can be brighter. 
  [Roque] Even though the present has its difficulties, and we 
must recognize them, we must face those difficulties so that we 
can look forward to that future we are talking about. 
  [Sexto] We must face it knowing that we are stepping on 
solid 
ground. There are many things to be decided and solved in the 
economic area. But we have a material base for Cuba's takeoff. 
As a matter of fact, I believe the country is already taking 
off. An airplane begins its takeoff once it begins to go forward 
on the runway. Cuba is already going forward on the runway.

<F P=106> [Report by Guillermo Morales] </F>
  [Text] At this very moment, Communist Party of Cuba 
officials and Havana businessmen are leaving the Cuban Workers 
Federation Lazaro Pena Theater where a meeting was held. I could 
describe the dialogue between Politburo member Jorge Lezcano and 
the businessmen as rough; however, I do believe it will be 
worthwhile. During the meeting, Lezcano said that efficiency is 
a key factor in the process. Lezcano, first secretary of the 
City of Havana Provincial Assembly, analyzed the operations of 
the City of Havana enterprises in 1993. He said that of the 462 
Havana enterprises, approximately 190 were profitable; however, 
160 enterprises reported losses. Lezcano added that the money 
owed the state by those enterprises amounts to 2.128 billion 
pesos. This is truly a hair-raising figure. Lezcano added that 
34 enterprises are facing serious problems. These 34 enterprises 
owe 1.24 billion pesos and of this amount, it is quite possible 
that 800 million pesos will never be paid back. If to this 
inefficiency -- which I personally doubt is caused solely by the 
special period -- we were to add the real problems we have, 
then, as the commander in chief said, 1993 was truly one of the 
most, if not the most difficult year. 
  We cannot deny we had a poor harvest in 1993, that 23,000 
homes were damaged by the storm of the century, and that we were 
affected by the neuropathy epidemic; but we must also add that 
1,000 doctors joined the capital city work force and we now have 
one doctor for every 132 residents of Havana. Please note that 
countries like Japan have one doctor for every 660 inhabitants. 
In 1993 we also provided daily lunches for 250,000 students. 
This equals the daily lunches for a city like Ciego de Avila or 
Sancti Spiritus. 
  Without raising false hopes, Lezcano said that 1994 will not 
be like 1993. He said that some sectors will show slight 
improvement. In late 1992, early 1993, the country had no oil 
and factories had to be halted. We began 1994 with these 
factories back in operation. We will continue to experience 
power outages and certain limitations; but with the factories 
now operating, things will be less difficult this year. 
  Please note that today we have more experience. I must 
recall 
and support our commander in chief's words: It is very important 
for us to concentrate on economic efficiency. I say that I 
support these words, even more so now after hearing what Lezcano 
had to say to the Havana businessmen.

<F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program with host Juan Carlos Roque Garcia </F>
and guest BOHEMIA reporter Luis Sexto, in Havana -- live] 
  [Text] [Roque] This is another "Straight Talk" program and 
our guest today is BOHEMIA reporter Luis Sexto. 
  As you know, workers around the country are meeting to 
discuss the measures that must be adopted to solve one of the 
biggest problems the country is confronting, excess currency. 
Luis Sexto will introduce the subject. 
  [Sexto] I am going to talk about the meetings underway 
throughout the country to discuss the possible measures that 
could be adopted to reduce, among other things, excess currency. 
Some listeners have called to ask me: What kind of measures will 
be adopted? What is going to be done? I have told them that I am 
not a fortune-teller. You can ask a reporter for his opinion on 
specific social problems or political happenings, but you cannot 
ask the reporter, or anyone else for that matter, to predict 
which measures will be adopted. We do not know that. 
  We are holding parliaments in the workplace. We have seen 
that the country is looking for a solution; it is asking around. 
  [Roque] And people have doubts. Undoubtedly, many people 
must 
satisfy their need to be informed. There are times when 
information is not available because we not have enough 
newspapers, because a power outage does not allow them to listen 
to a specific program. These are reasons we are all familiar 
with. However, I do believe we must inform on this problem. We 
must continue to broach it. 
  This problem has been discussed on "Straight Talk" in the 
past; however, today we are somewhat repeating it. We must do so 
because many people need the information, need to be told what 
is being done. 
  [Sexto] I agree and this is what motivated me to come here 
and talk about this crucial and basic problem for our country. 
The other day we talked about the big material basis our country 
has to overcome in the special period. We talked about all those 
real material and economic possibilities our country has as a 
result of all that it has built throughout the past 35 years. 
However, it is also necessary to adopt economic measures. We 
must streamline and improve other aspects of our economy that 
will make it easier for the whole material infrastructure to 
operate properly. 
  [Roque] Then why do people have doubts? Many of the people 
who have expressed doubts do not work. Many of these people stay 
at home; they have no way of attending a parliament at the 
workplace. 
  [Sexto] I believe that the people want measures to be 
adopted. I believe the people want to see the problem solved. 
Some are uncertain about the whole process. I want to say that 
this is a very delicate process. This is a very delicate 
situation. Some people may think that the country is taking too 
long to solve a pressing problem. The seriousness of the problem 
has been addressed publicly; our leaders have discussed this 
problem in public. However, we must also realize that this is 
such a serious and delicate problem that we must find the 
appropriate way to solve it and not make mistakes while solving 
it. The country must not make mistakes when solving the problem; 
otherwise, it will have to correct those mistakes and the 
situation will be even worse. We must find the best measures for 
everyone. 
  From the technical viewpoint, it is quite possible that the 
economists know what to do and can do it quickly; however, it 
has already been said, and I repeat: In Cuba, economy and 
politics go hand in hand. Economy and politics are one. This 
means that all economic measures adopted must first be analyzed 
from the political point of view. All interests must be 
reconciled before adopting any measures. We must avoid affecting 
the majority of the population. 
  [Roque] Luis Sexto and I, Juan Carlos Roque Garcia, are here 
searching for coinciding points on this "Straight Talk" program. 
We are talking about doubts the people have about the measures 
to be adopted. Their doubts are quite normal. The people are 
worried and they want to know what is happening. They want to 
know what kind of measures will be adopted. I wish to make it 
clear that these measures are still on the drawing board. 
  [Sexto] There is something I noticed among the listeners 
who called in. They are aware of what is being discussed at this 
or that work center, shop, or factory. Perhaps they are a bit 
confused about what is going on. Many people think that all the 
suggestions presented at these parliaments in the workplace are 
the actual measures that will be implemented. 
  [Roque] I will give you an example. A few days ago Renato 
Recio was on this program and he talked about a work center in 
Matanzas where the workers suggested that the number of sick 
leave days a worker can take be specified. This is only a 
suggestion made by the Matanzas workers. This has many people 
thinking. Many people have called asking what this would entail. 
  [Sexto] I know. Many people think that just because 
something 
has been suggested by a worker -- the worker made his suggestion 
publicly and the media covered it -- it will immediately become 
a measure to be implemented. They believe that any suggestion 
made will become a measure to be implemented. 
  [Roque] It is quite possible. 
  [Sexto] Yes. We have undertaken a process that many have 
called parliament in the workplace. The Cuban Workers Federation 
has approached the working class. It has sought the wisdom of 
the worker, the wisdom of the working man, to find the best way 
to solve this serious problem Cuba is facing. 
  [Roque] Most of the voters are included in that group. We 
must also realize that we heavily depend on production to solve 
the problem. Right? 
  [Sexto] Right. 
  [Roque] This is the reason the worker is being approached. 
  [Sexto] There is another purpose behind those parliaments in 
the workplace. The idea is not only to find a suitable proposal 
on solving the problem of the budget deficit and excess 
currency. The idea is also to get the workers to talk about how 
they can be more efficient. They are discussing what has to be 
done at the specific workplace to make it more efficient. When 
we improve efficiency we are also contributing to the reduction 
of excess currency. We are producing things that will be a 
tangible basis for the money we earn at a workplace. We will 
earn that money after we have produced a product. 
  [Roque] Many listeners write or call us. We must not forget 
that many of these listeners are not directly members of a work 
center; however, they are going to be affected by the measures 
that will be implemented. 
  [Sexto] If we use the word affected, some people may think 
they are going to be hurt by the implementation of the measures. 
I think many people may be a bit confused about this. We talk 
about measures that may affect the people or represent a 
sacrifice. People are wondering: What's cooking? Am I being 
prepared for something when I am told that these measures could 
affect me? Are they getting ready to hit me on the head? This 
has created uncertainty among some. 
  [Roque] But we cannot overlook the fact that measures are 
measures and someone will always be affected by them. 
  [Sexto] It is quite logical that the measures will affect 
some people. But let us stop and think about this a bit. I do 
not know what kind of measures are going to be implemented. I 
believe that no one in Cuba knows what measures are going to be 
implemented. Perhaps soon we will know. We will know once these 
meetings have ended and the National Assembly of the People's 
Government holds its extraordinary session. 
  I believe that the people may be affected to a certain 
extent, and we should put the word affected in quotation marks. 
For example, I believe that one of the measures that could be 
implemented -- and any thinking person in the country would 
agree -- will be the elimination of some of the gratuities the 
government provides. The elimination of some gratuities would 
allow the state to balance its income and spending. One of the 
sources for excess currency is the imbalance between what the 
government receives and what it spends in social benefits, 
subsidies, and others. The deficit this creates is harmful to 
our economy. Perhaps some of these gratuities should be 
eliminated, but first we must study how this elimination will 
affect the people. Up to now we have been enjoying many services 
for practically nothing. 
  Let us say that from now on we have to pay for the products 
included in the school ration book. What is the cost of a 
workbook and pencil compared to free medicine and free education? 
  [Roque] Luis Sexto is asking what would happen if parents 
had 
to pay for pencils and workbooks. This is something we get for 
free. 
  [Sexto] People would say that eliminating things like this 
affects them. And if we had to pay for uniforms, well, that 
would be for children with scholarships. Uniforms are usually 
bought at the store. Right now we do not have enough uniforms. 
  I also believe we could increase the amount we pay for 
electricity. What we pay for electricity is practically 
nothing. What would a few centavos mean if we are getting free 
medicine? What would a few centavos mean if we do not have to 
pay when a child gets sick, when you get sick, or when you get a 
heart transplant. That is what I am talking about. What if the 
telephone rates are increased. I am not saying that the 
telephone rates are going up. I am not saying that the 
electricity rates are going up. What I am saying is that this 
is what I am going to suggest when I participate at my 
Parliament in the Workplace. It is necessary for our country 
to be in accordance with the demands of the situation. Our 
country cannot continue to subsidize electricity; it cannot 
continue to subsidize telephone costs; it cannot continue to 
subsidize some basic products. The state is paying so that the 
consumer does not have to pay high prices for those products. 
That is what I am talking about. 
  [Roque] We are nearing the end of the program. 
  [Sexto] Give me a minute to finish what I was saying. I do 
not want to confuse the people with what I am about to say. I 
am not a fortune-teller. What measures are going to be adopted? 
I do not know. I think no one does. Let us wait for the ANPP 
extraordinary session and let the deputies decide what strategy 
our country will follow. What I want to do is remind the 
listeners that these measures will be adopted to solve a 
problem, not to create more problems. That is what we must 
remember. That is what we must keep in mind, and we should not 
be frightened. 
  [Roque] A process of awareness must be carried out. The 
people must be made aware of what is going to be done. 
  [Sexto] I believe that these parliaments in the workplace 
also are contributing to making the people aware of the problem. 
We have never had a problem like this one. Back in the 
seventies, the country faced a similar situation and the problem 
was solved differently. Back then we had the socialist bloc, we 
imported more products, new products were put up for sale, and 
part of the excess currency was taken off the streets. However, 
today's situation is different and we must become aware of this. 
Juan Carlos, I do believe that all that will be done will be to 
solve the problem. That is what we must keep in mind. 
  [Roque] You finished just in time. BOHEMIA reporter Luis 
Sexto was with us today on Straight Talk.

  [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 
at 0000 GMT on 19 January features a report in three parts by 
correspondent Diosdado Maso from Camaguey City. Maso reports 
that the Urban Buses Enterprise has established a new pilot 
system on three routes which consists of a profit- sharing 
scheme among the inspector, mechanic, driver, and electrician of 
each bus, where a percentage of the profits are divided among 
them at the end of each shift. 
  Maso interviews a driver and inspector who stress their 
renewed effort to ensure people pay their fares. One worker 
reports having made 200 extra pesos in two weeks, and another 70 
pesos in four days. Maso interviews several customers who highly 
praise the renewed quality and timeliness of the service. Maso 
stresses that since December, when it was first implemented, 
absenteeism has dropped, the number of trips has increased, 
breakdowns have been eliminated, costs have been reduced, less 
fuel is being used, the workers' morale is higher, and the 
people are receiving better service. Maso concludes: "This is an 
experience worth imitating."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon; from the "Evening </F>
Information Review" newscast] 
  [Text] The Cuban mechanical steel industry kept up the hope 
over the past few years of economic restriction of manufacturing 
urban buses with a high percentage of locally made parts. Even 
though parts are scarce, the truth is that the goal has been 
partially achieved. 
  Already rolling down the Havana streets are 32 of the first 
order for 60 buses called train-buses, due to their high 
passenger capacity, with hitches to adapt platforms or 
semi-trailers with the appropriate body. Each vehicle requires 
about 3,000 parts, in addition to 1.5 tons of metal, and some 
materials obtained by convertible foreign exchange. But the 
main manufacturing work is the responsibility of a group of 
workers at an enterprise located on the outskirts of Havana. 
  The train-buses, which have a capacity of 350 passengers, 
attract the attention of the Havana residents, who are tired of 
the severe scarcity of buses over the past four years, resulting 
from the termination of the parts supply contracts with Hungary. 
With parts sent from Hungary, Cuban workers assembled up to 800 
vehicles a year, but following the collapse of the socialist 
bloc, the agreements ended abruptly. 
  As a result of the known external factors, Cuba's purchasing 
power dropped from $8 billion in 1989 to $1.7 billion in 1993, 
an amount that is insufficient to purchase very expensive buses 
in the Western market. 
  Although it is not the most maneuverable vehicle for urban 
transportation, the train-bus has been called on to play the 
role of a surface metro to alleviate the heavy demand by the 
people of Havana, although it will not be able to eliminate the 
current severe shortage of buses. We cannot forget that the 
service is also affected by spare parts shortages and fuel 
limitations. The authorities therefore call on Cubans to 
continue to use bicycles and animals in the country's interior. 
  In the middle of the acute Cuban urban transportation 
limitations, the 200 train-buses that are to begin service in 
Havana, plus an equal number of donated buses, constitute a 
modest, albeit insufficient, injection into the service. But 
this does not mean that the efforts to build these types of 
vehicles in Cuba are any less valuable.

  [Text] There are 90 Basic Cooperative Production Units 
[UBPC] in Havana Province. Forty-eight of these tend sugarcane, 
29 miscellaneous crops, 10 tobacco, and three specialize in 
citrus. Candido Palmero, first secretary of the Communist Party 
of Cuba [PCC] in Havana, stressed to the plenary of the first 
provincial meeting of UBPC that in this first phase, crop 
tending efforts were better and there was a reduction of 37 
percent in the labor force. Under new concepts, this labor force 
was unnecessary. 
  Participants in the first provincial UBPC meeting are 
discussing -- in six work committees -- problems regarding 
finances, services, and the role the PCC, unions, and officials 
should play. Palmero urged UBPC members to produce for the 
people and not veer from the guidelines drafted by the PCC 
Politburo. 
  [Radio Reloj at 2045 on 21 January adds that the main goal 
of 
the meeting is to discuss positive and negative trends seen to 
date and that the sugar and agriculture ministers are in 
attendance, as are Politburo members Jose Ramon Machado Ventura 
and Carlos Lage.]

  [Text] Juan Contino, first secretary of the Union of Young 
Communists [UJC], today denied that there exists in our country 
a generational struggle for political power. Contino, the 
top-ranking UJC leader and also a member of the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba, told PRENSA LATINA in 
an interview that people are in the habit of talking about a new 
generation's taking over from the old and that the term is 
inappropriate, because it is like saying: You have come this 
far; now only I will go forward, alone. 
  Contino stressed: There are three generations of 
revolutionaries living in Cuba today, who, far from having a 
tradition of antagonisms, are in full agreement regarding the 
principles, paths, and objectives of the revolutionary process 
begun in 1959. 
  The youth leader also denied that Cuban society is currently 
facing a values crisis. He did admit, however, that there are 
segments of the youthful population with whom Cuba is having 
difficulties because of the national economic situation.

  [Text] Hamilton, Bermuda, 20 Jan, CANA -- The Swan 
government was dealt a second body blow this week when Ann 
Cartwright Decouto, one of its longest serving and toughest 
cabinet ministers, resigned as delegated affairs minister. [as 
received] 
  The Royal Gazette said on Thursday that her shock departure 
followed a cabinet row over independence. She will remain as an 
mp. 
  Premier Sir John Swan, already hit by Tuesday's resignation 
of Technology Minister Michael Winfield because of business and 
family reasons, said he was stunned by Mrs Decouto's decision. 
  In a letter released to the media Wednesday night, Sir John 
held back from accepting her resignation. 
  In her resignation letter to the premier, Mrs Decouto said 
she did not agree with the government holding a referendum on 
the question of independence for this British colony at the 
present time. 
  Bermuda is still trying to get to grips with the 
implications 
of the closure of three foreign military bases in the island. 
The Canadians closed their base at the end of last year and the 
United States and United Kingdom bases are to follow suit late 
next year. 
  "Bermuda has too much on its plate at this time (with the 
bases closing). 
  "I attempted to make my views clear at cabinet," said Mrs 
Decouto. 
  Sir John called an emergency cabinet meeting for Thursday to 
control what could mushroom into a crisis of confidence. 
  Sources said there was no connection between the two 
resignations. 
  The departure of Mrs Decouto, a lawyer and former deputy 
premier, ends a controversial ministerial career in which she 
become known as Bermuda's iron lady. 
  As minister of social services in the mid-1980s, she oversaw 
Bermuda's first responses to the AIDS crisis as well as 
commissioning of the new prison. 
  But it was her appointment as environment minister that 
solidified her reputation as a bold, no-nonsense politician. 
  In a bid to halt the island's dwindling stocks, she stood up 
to the island's fishermen and imposed a fish pot ban.

  [Text] Roseau, Dominica, 19 Jan, CANA -- Dominica's Trade 
Minister Charles Maynard said Wednesday that Latin American 
countries may soon be served notice that Dominica has no 
intention of playing "trade games". 
  Maynard's comments were made after news reached the region 
that five Latin American banana-exporting countries had got a 
panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), to 
rule that a European Union policy which gives preferential 
treatment to Caribbean bananas, violates GATT rules. 
  Maynard, speaking to CANA, expressed surprise that Venezuela 
which has been leading Latin American efforts to develop closer 
ties with the English-speaking Caribbean, was among the five 
countries. 
  The minister declined to name any Latin American country 
with 
which he was unhappy because of their fight for a bigger share 
of the European banana market, but it was obvious from his 
remarks that he was disappointed with Venezuela. 
  "We must be conscious of those who are playing games with 
us," he said. "There're some countries that want to have trading 
arrangements with us but at the same time when it comes to our 
trade and our critical trade in bananas, they are on the side of 
those who are jeopardising our interest." 
  Venezuela has extended to Caricom countries duty free access 
to its market for an initial period of five years. Just days 
ago, it was announced in Caracas, the venezuelan capital, that a 
new shipping service would be launched by March to facilitate 
trade between Venezuela and the English-speaking Caribbean. 
  "In the continuing effort ... to preserve what we have, to 
sustain the levels of protection that we have achieved, we must 
recognise and see where the blast is coming from and expose it," 
Maynard added. 
  "And we must let our friends know that we cannot seriously 
consider a partnership in trade with them as an ongoing 
arrangement, if at the same time at the international level, 
they're jeopardising our major export in bananas." 
  Dominica and other Windward Island banana exporters contend 
the European preferential arrangement is critical for the 
survival of the key foreign exchanging earning industry. They 
see the continuing Latin American challenge as an attempt to 
hurt their economies. 
  Reports by GATT panels have no legal weight until they are 
adopted by the trade body's full council which must reach 
consensus. 
  Guatemala, Colombia, Costa Rica and Nicaragua are the other 
countries which made the complaint.

  [Excerpts] The threat of severe sanctions against Haiti are 
confirmed. Haitian Ambassador to the United Nations Fritz 
Longchamp confirmed on 18 January that the international 
community is considering increasing the sanctions. This 
decision was made after the failure of the talks with the 
military for relaunching the application of the Governors Island 
accord. Rothschild Francois, Junior reports: 
  [Begin Francois recording] We are perhaps moving toward the 
reinforcement of the sanctions against Haiti, most likely this 
week. Haitian UN Ambassador Fritz Longchamp has this information 
to us here in Miami. Fritz Longchamp was not able to specify 
for us the nature of those sanctions. However some UN sources, 
which prefer to remain anonymous, indicate that an air embargo 
could be ordered against Haiti. Other UN sources indicate that 
nothing has yet been decided on the question. A meeting of the 
Security Council should be held this week, as the 15 January 
deadline for the Haitian military to apply the Governor Island 
accord has passed. [passage omitted]. 
  It should be pointed out that President-in-exile 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide is due to travel to Canada on 23 January. 
On 24 January, he is due to meet with the new head of the 
Canadian government, Mr. Jean Chretien. 
  This has been Rothschild Francois, Junior, in Miami for 
Radio 
Metropole. [end recording]

  [Text] Several Haitian companies and institutions have 
decided to close their doors due to the serious fuel crisis 
resulting from the embargo ordered by the UN. For example, this 
is the case with the Le Natal printing shop and Nicks Taxi. 
  Others have decided to reduce the hours they work daily, 
such 
as the National Brewing Company and the Port-au-Prince Custom 
Service. The managers of other companies say they will be able 
to function until the end of January. The manager of the 
National Oil Works company asserts that the company is no longer 
able to plan for the future, as now we work on a day-to day 
basis. The same story applies to the Four C laboratory company. 
The manager did not want to make public the options that will 
be considered at the end of the month. 
  The Adventist hospital in Diquini will no longer be able to 
function by the end of the week if the 1,500 gallons promised by 
the administrative committee handling the humanitarian fuel 
supply are not delivered. Even this fuel will not allow a 
normal functioning of the hospital. One of the hospital 
officials, contacted by Signal FM, asserts that a new schedule 
will have to be adopted which will have some consequences for 
the patients. Other companies such as Electricity of Haiti, 
CAMEP [drinking water company], and TELECO [telephone company] 
cannot function normally due to the extreme fuel scarcity.

  [Text] The Haitian private sector is threatened with ruin. 
The president of the Chamber of Commerce of Haiti has rung the 
alarm bell in face of the economic situation and asks the 
presidents of the two branches of the legislature to make the 
necessary decisions to correct the situation. 
  In a letter addressed to Senator Firmin Jean-Louis and to 
Deputy Frantz Robert Monde, [Chamber of Commerce President] 
Raymond Roy has solicited the intervention of Parliament in 
order to defend the private sector in the face of the serious 
situation. The Chamber of Commerce strongly fears that the 
private, commercial and industrial sector, which has already 
deeply suffered from the embargo's damage, is facing complete 
ruin, writes the president of the institution. Mr. Roy, who 
states that the chamber is concerned over the acute problem of 
scarcity of cash, thinks that it is the Parliament's duty to 
intervene when the public interest is threatened and to defend 
that interest. The president of the Chamber of Commerce pleads 
for the elimination of the system of a monetary ceiling, which 
is an anachronism. 
  Why do we continue to experience an archaic system which 
blocks the country's economic development and increases the 
financial risks, asks Mr. Roy? Warning that a new increase in 
the ceiling would only deepen the problem and postpone the real 
solution, the president of the Chamber of Commerce writes: The 
nation's economic forces are anxiously hoping that the two 
chambers of Parliament will prove to the entire country that 
they can stay on the sidelines, putting aside narrow political 
interests, and make the necessary decision to save the country's 
economic and financial infra- structure.

  [Text] As regards the holding of a national reconciliation 
conference, we should point out the steps taken so far by the 
Committee of Actions for National Reconciliation [CARENA]. The 
body has informed the public, via a press release, that informal 
meetings have taken place between members of its technical 
office in charge of organizing the national conference and 
several political personalities of the country, who have decided 
to work for the success of this inter-Haitian summit under the 
auspices of the most representative sectors of the civil society. 
  This week CARENA has invited the Parliament to take into 
account the upcoming resolutions of the national conference in 
Haiti and to get in touch with the United Nations and the OAS in 
order to request of the UN Security Council an immediate halt to 
the plan to reinforce the new sanctions against Haiti. 
Regarding this subject, a fruitful conversation has taken place 
between the members of the committee and the head of the French 
diplomatic mission to Haiti, Charge d'Affaires (Philippe Seltz), 
who has promised to pass this request on to his government. He 
showed himself particularly interested in the holding of this 
national conference in Haiti. The United States, Venezuela, and 
Canada have shown the same interest and received similar 
requests from the committee in order to stop any actions by 
international organizations which could aggravate the situation 
in Haiti. 
  The entire General Staff of the Haitian Armed Forces 
received 
the CARENA members, discussed the plan, and asked pertinent 
questions, while encouraging this objective and unbiased 
initiative of the key sectors of civil society, with no 
preconditions. By the way, a letter has been sent to President 
Aristide and to resigning Prime Minister Robert Malval for them 
to send a representative of the executive to this conference. A 
national conference appears to be an urgent subject for both 
sides, says CARENA. On that basis, the CARENA members deem it 
necessary today to ask all invited sectors to inform them of the 
names of their delegates by writing to the office of the 
national conference at the Holiday Inn in Champ-de-Mars. 
  This note is signed by Attorney Fritz Bissereth, coordinator 
in charge of the technical office; Attorney Bruny Raphael, 
coordinator in charge of the administrative affairs; and 
Adyjeangardy, coordinator in charge of communications.

  [Excerpts] The Parliament's 19 January session has been 
aborted. For its first convening, the Chamber of Deputies could 
not reach the necessary quorum for the debates planned 
yesterday. Frantz Robert Monde, the new president of the Chamber 
of Deputies, warned he would take sanctions against the 
absentees or those who believe in an empty seat. Edner Jean 
files a report: 
  [Begin recording] [Jean] Several reasons can explain the 
failure of this first session of the Chamber of Deputies under 
the aegis of President Monde. First of all, the absence of 
several legislators, most particularly those of the BP-FNCD 
[Parliamentary Bloc for the National Front for Change and 
Democracy] who stayed in the United States after the 
international conference. The difficulties in obtaining fuel 
allegedly also forced some deputies to stay home. However, 
beyond those considerations, the postponement of this session is 
mostly interpreted as a response from a group of deputies to the 
election of Frantz Robert Monde. The new president of the 
Chamber spoke about the boycott and is considering taking severe 
measures against the absent deputies. Thus, Monde is giving his 
first warning to the absent deputies: 
  [Monde] Obviously some sectors wish to boycott the work of 
the Chamber. You can be sure that we are going to consider 
immediate measures to stave off their efforts. However, it is 
sad to note that some legislators, paid to attend debates, do 
not have the courage to do so and prefer, for a question of 
bureau, not present themselves at the Chamber. It is a shame for 
those that they represent. 
  [Jean] What kind of solutions are you considering, 
President? 
Some deputies suggested seizing the checks of the absent 
deputies. 
  [Monde] All the measures being considered will be taken with 
the majority. [end recording] 
  [Jean] The former president of the Chamber considers that it 
is too early to speak of a boycott. Antoine Joseph, who is back 
to his status of a simple deputy, thinks that it falls upon the 
new leader to search for the causes which provoked the absence 
of the deputies in order to find a solution as soon as possible. 
This is necessary because a session full of issues is awaiting 
the deputies, he explains. 
  [Begin Joseph recording in Creole] It is too early to speak 
of a boycott. Perhaps there are many problems. Maybe there is 
a lack of contact with the presidents of the groups. The 
mobilization is not going very well. There is also a problem of 
gasoline. I think that the parliamentary bureau should take 
things in hand and search for the causes with the deputies and 
then take measures which would allow holding the session. We are 
at a difficult juncture which should prompt us to hold sessions 
to decide the important issues. There are economic problems; 
there is the possibility of a new increase in the monetary 
ceiling;, there is also the national conference; there is the 
resignation of the Malval government. We have as many important 
issues which the Parliament must make decisions on. Personally, 
I think that the holding of sessions during these times is 
urgent and necessary. Thus, the parliamentary bureau must take 
measures in order to hold sessions.[end recording] 
  [Jean] Antoine Joseph, who just lost his post of president 
to 
the profit of Frantz Robert Monde, does not get discouraged. He 
is about to constitute a new bloc in the lower chamber, a bloc 
which should offset the powers of the Alliance in face of the 
FNCD. [passage omitted] The socialists who have a representative 
within the new parliamentary bureau, Mac-Ferl Morquette, the 
vice president, did not give all that they could to obtain a 
quorum. The socialists prefer to wait and hope, a wait and see 
attitude.

<F P=106> [Report by Jean Luckenson; passages in italics in Creole -- </F>
recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] They are perhaps moving toward a 
resolution advocating the dissolution of the Haitian parliament. 
The recommendations of the seven workshops at the Congress for 
National Salvation provide for the immediate formation of a 
government of public security, setting aside the 1987 
Constitution, dissolving the parliament, and enforcing the 1950 
Constitution. On this second working day, Jean Luckenson met 
with Herve Leveille. Let us listen to his report: 
  [Luckenson] We met with druggist Herve Leveille, 
secretary general of the national congress, for explanation. 
Leveille said that they have held this congress in order to find 
a final solution to the crisis that the country has been 
experiencing for over two years. The participants in the 
national congress have come from the nine geographic departments 
of the country and will have to form a government of public 
security that can work with the international community in 
finding a real solution to the sociopolitical crisis being 
experienced by the country. 
  [Leveille] In the face of the imminent peril to the country, 
in the face of the danger that the country might disappear, 
we need the formation of a government of public 
security. 
  [Luckenson] If I understand rightly, you have held this 
national congress in order to form a government of public 
security. 
  [Leveille] Yes, but it will be a beginning, it will be a 
beginning because I must also give you additional 
explanation. This congress is held by persons who.... It is 
mostly groups of citizens who met in the nine departments and 
sent delegations. As delegations from the civil society, they 
will meet to see whether they can form a government that can 
confer with the international community, can start a dialogue 
with the international community so we can resolve the 
crisis. 
  [Luckenson] Leveille went on to say that no 
institutions -- whether the Army or in the democratic sector -- 
have representatives at the congress and that those who are 
present have participated as simple citizens of the country. But 
what can we expect from this national congress? Let us listen to 
Leveille. 
  [Leveille] The only thing I would like this congress to 
accomplish is that everybody become aware of the fact that all 
of us are wrong, that all of us have put the country in this 
situation, and that all of us should try to see what we can do 
by putting our personal interests aside for a while. 
  [Luckenson] We saw in the room citizens from various 
departments. We also saw political personalities such as Dr. 
Montalvo Despeignes [former minister without portfolio under the 
Nerette-Honorat government]; the Rev. Richard Vladimir Jeanty, 
leader of the Haitian Party of God; Vanes Cherestal, national 
coordinator of the National Confederation of the People's 
Organizations of the Country; and General Philippe Biamby.

  [Excerpt] The senators of the Alliance For Parliamentary 
Cohesion as well as the senators elected on 18 January in 
contested circumstances are supporting the project to hold a 
national conference. On 19 January, these senators adopted a 
resolution in that respect. Considering that it is a good 
initiative, the senators of the Alliance For Parliamentary 
Cohesion have decided to take charge of it. Let us listen to 
one of the senators elected on 18 January, Amos Andre: 
  [Begin recording] [Senator Andre in Creole] Being one of the 
three branches of state power, we cannot leave in the hands of 
people who have no legitimacy or legal standing an activity 
which is going to define the fate of the nation. It is within 
this context that we voted a resolution on 19 January to have 
the Haitian Parliament take charge of the conference. 
  [Reporter Edner Jean] Some people think that this step could 
be a new blow that the senators of the Alliance, in fact the 
legislators opposed to President Aristide, are staging, just 
like the Villa D'Acceuil agreement, where you will take the 
process in hand and propose your own solutions so that it can be 
voted on in Parliament. 
  [Senator Andre] Far from that, far from that. As senators of 
the Republic, we received a mandate which is defined by the 
Constitution, and President Aristide also received a mandate 
defined by the Constitution. Our role as senators is to search 
with the Haitian people for any solutions that could solve the 
crisis. Some legislators were absent for other reasons that they 
deem more important than reasons to be in the Senate, but we 
think that the country's situation is very difficult and we must 
work on it seriously. That is what motivates our presence. We 
have no idea or intention to stage a coup against the president. 
What will be the use of it? That is not what our step means. 
Our objective is to find a favorable solution for all the people 
involved in the Haitian crisis, because we are at a phase where 
even the people who provoked the crisis are now suffering, along 
with everyone else, meaning that everyone is in crisis in the 
country. 
  Even if you did not participate in a coup d'etat, you are 
facing an embargo, you cannot function normally. As for me as a 
senator, I cannot function normally. Even the president's 
supporters cannot function normally. We are facing a situation 
where the country can no longer resist under the conditions of 
the embargo and the division within the country. We believe 
that as state representatives we must act to see if we can 
extract the country from the crisis.[Passage omitted].

  [Text] The people's Congress for National Salvation 
concluded its work on 20 January with the adoption of a 
resolution establishing a three-member government of public 
security. At the conclusion of three days of debates and works 
in small committees, gathered at the National Theater, about 100 
delegates representing the nine geographic departments of the 
country demanded the formation of this government consisting of 
Notary Public Raoul Kenol; industrialist Charles Plaisimond, and 
Cap-Haitien Court of Appeal Judge Louis Toussaint. 
  This government's mission is to normalize conditions, 
promote 
national reconciliation, and restore the authority of the state. 
  The congress, which was held on the initiative of the Great 
North citizens group, calls for general concerted action and 
condemns the embargo ordered against Haiti. The delegates 
brought their principal voted resolutions to the office of the 
Chamber of Deputies in the hope of enforcement as a matter of 
urgency.

  [Excerpts] The Congress for National Salvation decided to 
form a government of public security and went to the Legislative 
Palace. Congress participants want to meet with the president of 
the National Assembly so he can formally record this 
three-member government. Jean Luckenson's report follows. 
  [Begin recording] [Luckenson] A government of public 
security was established on 20 January at 1600 by resolution of 
the the Congress for National Salvation held at the National 
Theater by the Group of the Great North 18 to 20 January. The 
three named to lead this government were Raoul Kenol, a lawyer 
representing Artibonite Department; Charles Plaisimond, an 
industrialist representing the Department of the West; and Louis 
Toussaint, judge at the Court of Appeals in Cap-Haitien. The 
congressmen spoke on behalf of the deputies and senators of the 
45th Legislature. [passage omitted] 
  Before the members of the government of public security 
went to the parliament to meet with Chamber of Deputies 
President Frantz Robert Monde, congress Secretary General Herve 
Leveille stated that they are strong; they will block the 
country and prevent everybody from working if the parliament 
disagrees. 
  [Leveille] If [the parliamentarians] do not accept [the 
two resolutions we adopted], we will block the country. We are 
now going to the parliament so it can adopt them. 
  [Unidentified journalist] Mr. Leveille, what will you do in 
the event the parliament refuses? 
  [Leveille] We will know what to do. We will know what to do. 
[repeats] 
  [Journalist] Is it a revolutionary solution? 
  [Leveille] [words indistinct] to handle certain things 
carefully. 
  [Journalist] Do you have the support of the Army? Do 
you have the support of the Army? 
  [Leveille] The Army is an institution in the service of the 
people. The Army is not an institution.... 
  [Luckenson] You say you will block the country if the 
parliament does not agree [with your resolutions]. Will you tell 
us how? 
  [Leveille] With force. We can block the country. 
  [Luckenson] What strategic means will you use? 
  [Leveille] We will block the roads. 
  [Luckenson] A few minutes later, the members of the new 
government of public security, made up of political 
personalities hostile to President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's 
return to power in Haiti, accompanied by the forces of order, 
went to the parliament while over a dozen men and women 
demonstrated their opposition to President Aristide and the 
international community. Upon their arrival at the parliament, 
the members of the government of public security were received 
at the diplomatic lounge of the Legislative Palace while the 
secretary general of the Chamber of Deputies [as heard] was 
taking steps to get in touch with the president, Frantz Robert 
Monde, who said that they will look into this issue in the next 
few days, [especially] at the reopening session of the Chamber 
of Deputies if a quorum is reached on 25 January: 
  [Monde] Only the unity of the sons of the homeland can save 
this country, which is in an acute and very delicate crisis. We 
said and we repeat: Your file will be read and entrusted to a 
special committee; the parliament will give its verdict with 
confidence and as soon as possible. [passage omitted] 
  [Luckenson] We should tell you that two resolutions 
have been adopted. The first contains three [number as heard] 
points: safeguarding national sovereignty, condemning the 
embargo, reinforcing the public institutions, and restoring the 
authority of the state. The second resolution establishes the 
government of public security. Several political personalities, 
including Professor Hubert De Ronceray [leader of Mobilization 
for National Development], Montalvo Despeignes [former minister 
without portfolio under the Nerette-Honorat government], the 
Reverend Richard Vladimir Jeanty [leader of the Haitian Party of 
God], Jean-Claude Roy [leader of the Union of Haitian 
Constitutionalists], former Agriculture Minister Jacques Baker, 
and Carl Denis [of the National Coalition] were present.

  [Text] Reynold Georges, leader of the Alliance for the 
Liberation and Advancement of Haiti, ALAH, reproaches the 
members of the congress for their sectarianism and for their 
procedure he deems arbitrary. Georges favors the national 
conference of the Committee of Action for National 
Reconciliation, to be held 6-7 February, and also a government 
of concord. 
  [Begin Georges recording, in Creole] Despite all the 
positions we took and the talks we held with those gentlemen 
[from the national congress] in order to make them understand 
what is right, they are not listening. We want then to know 
that: First, ALAH has some legislators within the parliament, 
whom we hope they will not attack; second, nor any other 
legislators; third, we heard that they formed a government in 
which they assert that the North represents Artibonite and the 
West. We are asking that the other six departments be 
represented, particularly the department of the Center, where we 
are a representative. 
  We accept dictates from no one and we are formally asking 
the 
Haitian Army and the police to fulfill their responsibilities to 
stop those power-hungry gentlemen. In the event of failure to do 
so, we will take the necessary measures to deal with them 
through our own means. We are issuing a watchword to all ALAH 
members throughout the nine geographical departments. We are 
asking them to mobilize, to get in touch with the party's office 
immediately tomorrow morning. We will take measures to protect 
our members on the one hand and to protect the national 
sovereignty on the other hand, so that no small groups of petty 
persons endanger the country's durability. I am accusing them of 
sectarianism and of pettiness. A small group of people cannot 
pretend to national sovereignty. [end recording]

  [Text] The office of the Chamber of Deputies had invited 
the legislators from the various political blocs to participate 
on 21 January in an informal meeting at 11:00 at the Lower 
Chamber. However, there are right now very few deputies at the 
Chamber. Edner Jean reports live: 
  Parliament is basically waiting. In the Legislative Palace, 
the deputies are still expected; they were due to respond to the 
invitation of the president of the Chamber for this special 
meeting scheduled today. 
  Right now, there are very few deputies present. The 
president 
is here. Only five or six legislators are here. 
  There is also a waiting outside, by those demonstrators who 
came on 20 January to the parliament to submit the resolution of 
the national congress forming a government of public security. 
They came back this morning. They are demanding that the 
Parliament consider the matter right now. They demand that the 
government be seated as soon as possible at the National Palace. 
Right now, they are calm outside and are waiting until later to 
start demonstrating. 
  It should be recalled that on 20 January, Deputy Monde, 
president of the Lower Chamber, stated to the office of the 
Congress for the National Salvation that he would not act under 
pressure. However, a few hours later, President Monde issued a 
note convening the legislators to a special meeting. 
  It is known that ordinarily on Fridays, most of the deputies 
do not work.

  [Text] Castries, St. Lucia, 18 Jan, CANA -- The St Lucia 
Banana Growers Association (SLBGA) is to be placed in 
receivership, Agriculture Minister Ira D'Auvergne announced. 
  The move was recommended by a government appointed 
committee, 
whose mandate was to come up with a new administrative structure 
for the island's financially-strapped banana industry. 
  In a radio and television address, D'Auvergne said the SLBGA 
was bankrupt with current debts of 42 million dollars (one EC 
dollar ; 37 cents US), up from the 30 million dollars reported 
at the height of a strike by farmers last October. 
  The farmers were pushing for increased prices for their 
fruit 
at a time when the industry was hit by a falling market prices 
and decreasing exchange value of the British pound sterling, the 
hard currency earned from exports. 
  Since the strike, in which police shot and killed two 
protestors, the SLBGA has been spending nearly one million 
dollars weekly to pacify grumbling farmers through a programme 
of price support. 
  D'Auvergne said in addition, the SLBGA now owed 56 million 
dollars to the local company which supplies cartons for the 
export of bananas and another 8.6 million dollars to input 
suppliers. 
  The SLBGA also owes the National Commercial Bank (NCB) 10 
million dollars in loans and overdraft, 6.4 million dollars to 
Geest industries, the marketing company, three million dollars 
in gratuities due to staff, and three million in cess credits 
due to farmers. 
  Said D'Auvergne of the association's accumulated debt: "This 
figure continues to grow every week and it has become obvious 
that this situation cannot be allowed to continue." 
  The SLBGA announced Tuesday that price support payments to 
farmers during last week amounted to 921,996 dollars or nearly 
18 cents per pound of bananas sold. 
  D'Auvergne said the government-appointed committee had 
recommended that a receiver be appointed to manage the SLBGA for 
a stated period during which certain forms of reorganisation of 
the association will be examined to determine which was to be 
adopted for ensuing the future viability and stability of the 
industry. 
  He said banana growers here were being paid 31, 28 and 26 
cents per pound for grades a, b and c fruit respectively which 
was higher than the 24.3 and 20.3 cents per pound for grades a 
and b fruit being paid to their counterparts in St Vincent and 
the Grenadines and the 25 cents per pound growers in Dominica 
were receiving. 
  Government ministers plan to meet banana farmers Wednesday 
to 
discuss the state of the industry and plans to restructure it. 
That meeting will take place in the eastern village of Dennery, 
hotbed of the protest last October.

  [Text] Quito, 19 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- The reforms to the 
Constitution approved by the Ecuadoran Congress have provoked 
various reactions among domestic political factions. 
  Legislators from the rightist Social Christian Party (which 
holds a majority in Congress), other progovernment parties, and 
independent parties voiced satisfaction over the reforms, which 
they described as "very important and justified." During a 
special session of Congress last night, a group of legislators 
promoted the constitutional reforms that will become effective 
in 1996. 
  Congress approved increasing the number of deputies (from 77 
to 113), the participation of independent candidates (except for 
the posts of president and vice president of the Republic), and 
the elimination of mid-term elections. The next step is to turn 
over the reforms to President Sixto Duran-Ballen for final 
approval. 
  Fernando Rosero, leader of the Ecuadoran Roldosist Party, 
announced his parliamentary faction will strive to abolish the 
reforms because they are the product of a "spurious" session. 
Deputies from minority parties -- the Democratic Left (ID), 
Popular Democracy Party, and Democratic People's Movement -- 
voiced their opposition and agreed that the approval of the 
reforms "showed some serious irregularities." 
  ID Deputy Antonio Rodriguez said increasing the number of 
deputies would imply a heavy allotment from the state budget. 
He added that President Duran-Ballen's ruling will allow 
knowing if his policy of reducing the state and exercising 
fiscal austerity is authentic. Minority deputies noted that the 
reforms had been approved in a very hasty manner, adding that 
these reforms were useful for "certain smug attitudes of the 
Social Christians."

  [Text] The constitutional reforms issue has promped a 
dispute between different congressional factions. Members of 
the opposition charge the issue of extending the deputies' term 
prompted a delay in the adjournment of the congressional 
sessions, but independent deputies claim the one has nothing to 
do with the other. 
  [Begin unidentified independent deputy recording] The 
adjournment of the congressional sessions, or a continuation of 
the sessions during a special period, have absolutely nothing to 
do with an extension of the deputies' term or their immediate 
re-election. We were emphatic about this, and those of us who 
participated in a political dialogue between Social Christians, 
conservatives, and independents said we will never discuss a 
transition period that may extend current deputies' term or lead 
to their immediate re-election --nothing that might benefit 
current individual deputies will be approved. [end recording] 
  The new majority seems to have scattered and constitutional 
reforms have been abolished for the time being. If the special 
period of sessions ends without discussing the reforms, they 
will be discussed on another occasion, starting from the 
beginning.

  [Text] The Democratic Left [ID] has reiterated its 
rejection of the way the constitutional reforms were [word 
indistinct]. Members of ID said there is clear evidence that the 
goal was to approve an extension of the deputies' term and their 
immediate reelection. 
  [Begin ID Bloc leader Andres Vallejo recording] We want to 
reiterate, on behalf of the ID bloc, that we reject the approval 
of constitutional reforms and the way the issue was handled. It 
was obvious yesterday that deputies still have plans to extend 
their term even though they did not get the necessary 52 votes 
-- for the third time -- to establish clearly that there will be 
no extension of terms or immediate reelection [sentence as 
heard]. It is obvious that they intend to prevent the approval 
of the temporary provision that would implement constitutional 
reforms effective 1996. That is another reason why we insisted 
on the need to close the Congress sessions. It cannot continue 
to function to approve reforms under these circumstances and 
with an electoral process under way. [end recording] 
  ID Bloc leader Andres Vallejo said he endorses the closure 
of 
the special congress period, because then the reforms will fail 
and they will be discussed on another occasion, free from 
political considerations.

  [Text] Leading community figures interested in the cause of 
indigenous groups yesterday evening participated in a panel 
discussion in which they talked about the Barbados Declaration 
III. This document will be submitted to international 
organizations with a view to having ethnic differences respected 
and defended, as this is the only way in which different 
cultures can coexist in the present times. 
  Miguel Chase Sardi [anthropologist and former head of the 
National Indian Affairs Institute] said "this is a note of 
warning that was sounded precisely a few days prior to the 
events that took place in Chiapas, during which local indigenous 
communities were brutally repressed. Here we requested what we 
have been requesting since 1970, namely that indigenous 
communities be granted self- government and self-determination. 
This will not entail the destruction of the state. Actually, 
for a state to flourish it must necessarily be multiracial and 
pluralist as far as culture and language are concerned. We are 
very pleased to note that our Constitution fairly comes up to 
that idea." Despite this Chase Sardi later said that it is to 
be regretted that the law is known but is not observed. 
  The most salient points of the document signed by social 
researchers, anthropologists, and intellectuals underscores that 
the letter of intent was drafted because they are "witnesses in 
each of our countries to reiterated violations of the right to 
life, to dignity, and to the cultural and human environment in 
their local manifestations." 
  This lengthy document further stresses that "in the same way 
that each ethnic group was forced over centuries to integrate 
and adhere to the unspecified advantages of an ill-defined 
national life, the same mandatory proposal is at present made to 
Latin American countries to join and integrate themselves into a 
world order controlled by a multinational oligopoly." 
  They claim that democracy as a philosophy of a Western 
social 
system revolves around the individual, and excludes the 
communities of indigenous peoples. 
  They call upon Latin American rulers to keep the promise 
made 
to indigenous peoples in the Guadalajara Declaration of 1971, 
when they solemnly pledged to ensure their economic and social 
welfare as well as respect their rights and cultural identities. 
  At present the spotlight of international criticism is 
focused precisely on Mexico, where the treaty was signed, 
because of the inhumane treatment of indigenous communities in 
Chiapas. Concerning this Miguel Angel Fernandez, a writer, 
wrote a letter which, if the necessary signatures are collected, 
will be sent to Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, 
petitioning him "to put an end to the military repression (and 
in general all cultural, economic, political, or social 
repression and oppression) in Chiapas, and to establish the 
necessary basis for a fair and free coexistence among all ethnic 
groups." The letter concludes by expressing solidarity with the 
indigenous people of Chiapas.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities monitored through 20 January. 
  Finance Minister Crispiniano Sandoval reported that only 46 
percent of the investments projected in the 1993 budget were 
executed because of the deficit in the government's income. He 
said the economy grew 4 percent, and the balance of payments' 
current account deficit dropped $200 million. (Asuncion NOTICIAS 
in Spanish 10 Jan 94 Economic Supplement p 7) 
  A rotor weighing 560 metric tons for Yacyreta Hydroelectric 
Enterprise's first generator was installed on 19 January during 
a ceremony headed by President Juan Carlos Wasmosy and top 
Argentine officials. Argentine official Jorge Dominguez said the 
general timetable of the project will not be changed; electric 
energy will start being produced on 1 September 1994. He also 
announced that a loan of $130 million from the Inter-American 
Development Bank will be signed on 26 January, of which $80 
million will be used to relocate people affected by the 
reservoir and $30 million to protect the Aguapey river. 
(Asuncion HOY in Spanish 20 Jan 94 p 2) 
  The General Customs Directorate reported that Paraguayan 
exports to the other three Mercosur, Common Market of the South, 
countries increased 26 percent in 1993 compared with 1992. 
Paraguayan exports in 1993 reached $298.4 million, compared with 
$237.3 million in 1992. In 1993 exports to Brazil reached $225.2 
million; Argentina, $67.3 million; and Uruguay, $5.9 million. 
Exports to Argentina decreased due to tariffs imposed by the 
Argentine Government. Brazil bought 75 percent of Paraguayan 
exports to the region, mainly soybean. (Asuncion ULTIMA HORA in 
Spanish 20 Jan 94 p 23)

  [Excerpts] Canadian International Trade Minister Roy 
MacLaren said that Chile is the "number one" potential candidate 
for joining the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that 
groups the United States, Mexico, and Canada. 
  MacLaren, who paid a two-day visit to Chile to enhance 
commercial ties and discuss Chile's possible entry into NAFTA, 
met Finance Minister Alejandro Foxley. 
  Reporting on their meeting, Foxley pointed out that they 
discussed the various methods for Chile to join NAFTA. MacLaren 
mentioned the possibility that our country might directly join 
NAFTA through an access clause, instead of reaching bilateral 
agreements with each one of the NAFTA member countries. 
[passage omitted] 
  Over the past few years Canada has been one of the greatest 
foreign investors in Chile, with investments totaling about $4 
billion, basically concentrated in the mining area. The latest 
investment was made by the Canadian firm Lac Minerals, which 
formed a consortium with the U.S. company Cyprus to mine the El 
Abra copper deposit in northern Chile. 
  Nevertheless, the trade flow between the two countries is 
very low, with Chilean exports totaling $53 million in 1991 and 
$63.7 million in 1992. In turn, Canadian exports to Chile 
totaled $157 million in 1991 and $162 million in 1992. 
<H5>  APEC and GATT </H5>
  The two ministers announced their decision to continue 
cooperating with GATT, the establishment of a new world trade 
organization, and with APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation), 
which Chile will join as a full-fledged member in November. 
  Foxley thanked the Canadian Government for its support for 
Chile's entry into APEC, and reported that he and MacLaren 
established the beginnings of cooperation in forming the 
orientation APEC ought to have. 
  For the Chilean minister, one of the most important issues 
discussed in their meeting were the prospects for the 
international economy after agreement had been reached on the 
Uruguay Round. Foxley explained that the new world trade 
organization that will replace GATT will establish the rules and 
regulations; it will establish mechanisms to settle disputes, 
and will oversee the enforcement of the rules and regulations by 
the member countries. 
  Foxley said that in the same way the two countries had 
managed to cooperate within the context of the Cairns Group in 
the discussion of the agricultural issue during the Uruguay 
Round, Chile and Canada should continue cooperating as medium- 
and small-sized countries that have common interests in the 
establishment of this organization. 
  All these issues will continue to be reviewed by the next 
administration. MacLaren and Foxley thus participated in a 
working luncheon with Foreign Minister-designate Carlos Figueroa 
and Finance Minister-designate Eduardo Aninat. Foxley said 
that, with Figueroa and Aninat, "we established a line of 
continuity between our actions, to coordinate these negotiations 
and agreements and the actions to be carried out by the next 
administration."

  [Text] Foreign Minister Enrique Silva Cimma on 10 January 
told EL MERCURIO that the government maintains its position 
toward the Common Market of the South (Mercosur), noting that 
the government likes the agreement but cannot join it for 
various reasons. 
  Silva Cimma mentioned the issue after being asked about 
press 
reports published by EL MERCURIO quoting him as saying in 
Brasilia that Chile would negotiate its membership with NAFTA 
and Mercosur. 
  According to news agency reports, Silva Cimma said: "We will 
try to move forward, negotiating with both mechanisms." He 
reportedly said there is no incompatibility in this approach. 
  Asked about this report, the minister said he found it very 
strange that such a thing has been said, and that he was 
misinterpreted. 
  "I never said that. Chilean policy remains totally the 
same," 
he replied. 
  Silva Cimma denied that he talked about the issue in 
Brasilia 
during a news conference, explaining that there was no such 
conference and that was he was asked by only two journalists 
about Mercosur. "I told them: 'Look, we like Mercosur, but for 
various reasons we cannot join it.'" 
  The document that created Mercosur is known as the Treaty of 
Asuncion, which was signed in 1991 by Argentina, Brazil, 
Paraguay, and Uruguay. 
  Under the treaty's terms, there will be a customs union 
among 
those countries as of 1 January 1995, with zero internal tariffs 
and a common external tariff, while their economic policies will 
be made as consistent as possible. 
  The Chilean position toward this treaty has remained 
unchanged. Chile has noted its satisfaction over the treaty, 
expressed thanks for the repeated invitations to join it, and 
refused to do it for technical and not political reasons. 
  Summing up, there are three reasons that prevent Chile from 
joining Mercosur: 1) the difficult short-term coordination of 
the bilateral agreements signed within Mercosur on matters like 
protection against third countries, nontariff restrictions, 
foreign investment, incorporation of new technology, 
intellectual property, and pharmaceutical patents; 
  2) The weight of the Brazilian economy in the group, because 
of its protectionist policy and economic imbalances; and 
  3) The fact that Chile has eliminated all nontariff 
restrictions through bilateral agreements, while Mercosur will 
not enforce this measure until 1 January 1995.

  [Text] Santiago, 19 Jan (EFE) -- Manuel Santos Vera, 
Ecuadoran minister of government and police [title as received], 
has ruled out a possible Indian uprising in his country. He 
admitted, however, that the police are investigating the 
possible existence of a rebel group ideologically similar to the 
Peruvian guerrilla group "Shining Path." 
  Santos Vera said today that for the time being no indication 
has been found to confirm the existence of such a rebel group, 
allegedly called "Red Sun." 
  Santos Vera, who will stay in Chile until 21 January, added 
that the alleged Ecuadoran rebel group has so far not carried 
out any political propaganda operation or armed action. 
  The minister said that Ecuadoran Indians are organized in 
different groups, participate in the social life of the country, 
and that President Sixto Duran-Ballen's policies seek to 
integrate them into the mainstream of Ecuadoran society. 
  The minister said that Ecuador is "an island of peace" 
compared to neighboring countries, obviously referring to 
Colombia and Peru, although without naming them. 
  Santos Vera said that the police have not detected a 
"Shining 
Path" organized infiltration movement in the Ecuadoran Andean 
Altiplano region. 
  The minister said that the police under his command remain 
alert to detect any infiltration, adding that when any of them 
is found out they are sent back to Peru.

  [Text] The Chilean Government has stated that it owes

Fishing Company, a CORFO branch which no longer exists, rented 
Russian ships. 
  He said that the Chilean Government knows what to do over a 
Russian Government demand for compensation. 
  [Begin Aveliuk recording, in progress] ... CORFO believes it 
has absolutely nothing to do with them. This is obvious because 
it was an associated enterprise, which is very different from

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Chile monitored through 20 
January. 
  The Institute for Export Production reported that 
Argentina became Chile's third most-important commercial partner 
in 1993. Exports to it in January-November 1993 totalled $539.3 
million, 26.7 percent higher than in the same period in 1992. 
Japan is first with $1.4351 billion, followed by the United 
States with $1.4134 billion. (Santiago ESTRATEGIA in Spanish 5 
Jan 94 p 6) 
  The National Statistics Institute, INE, reported that 
industrial production increased 3.2 percent between January and 
November 1993 compared with the same period in 1992. The sectors 
with highest increase in November were the manufacturing of 
professional and ophthalmologic equipment with 35.1 percent; 
machines, 24.9 percent; furniture, 16.2 percent, and beverages, 
15.5 percent. (Santiago LA TERCERA DE LA HORA in Spanish 6 Jan 
94 Economy Section p 4) 
  On 5 January, the INE reported that the unemployment rate 
dropped 4.4 percent in the September-November 1993 quarter. The 
country's labor force totalled 5,171,640 people in the same 
quarter, an increase of 5.3 percent compared with the same 
period in 1992. The number of employed people was 4,946,400, an 
increase of 5.8 percent compared with the same quarter in 1992. 
(Santiago LA TERCERA DE LA HORA in Spanish 6 Jan 94 Economic 
Section p 2) 
  On 5 January, the INE reported that the consumer price index 
was 0.2 percent in December 1993, and that the cumulative 
inflation rate was 12.2 percent in 1993, the lowest in 12 years. 
Transportation and telecommunications registered the highest 
increase in December at 1.1 percent; housing, 0.7 percent; and 
others, 2.9 percent. Food prices dropped 1.9 percent and 
clothing prices were unchanged. (Santiago LA TERCERA DE LA HORA 
in Spanish 6 Jan 94 Economy Section pp 1, 2) 
  According to Eduardo Moyano, director of the Foreign 
Ministry's international economic relations, Chilean exports 
dropped 7 percent in 1993 compared with the previous year, 
totaling $9.3 billion, when they reached $9.986 billion in 1992. 
This is the first time since 1985 that total Chilean exports 
dropped compared with the previous year, although overall 
Chilean exports have grown from approximately $3 billion in the 
beginning of the 1980's to almost $10 billion now. (Santiago EL 
MERCURIO in Spanish 8 Jan 94 pp A1, A19) 
  According to Central Bank figures, overall Chilean 
international reserves in 1993 were $9.7586 billion, increasing 
$750 million last year. In 1992, the country's net international 
reserves increased by $2.3693 billion, closing the year with 
$9.0086 billion. (Santiago EL MERCURIO 8 Jan 94 p B1) 
  According to the INE, national mining production, including 
metallic and non-metallic products, increased 5.2 percent during 
the January-November 1993 period compared with same period in 
1992. During that period, copper production reached 1,922,219 
metric tons, which compared to the 1,787,551 metric tons the 
previous year is a 7.5 percent increase. Gold and silver 
production dropped, while lead production also increased.

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Helena Tachinardi] </F>
  [Text] Colonia -- Finance Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso said on 17 January in Colonia -- when meeting his 
Argentine counterpart, Domingo Cavallo --that he is not a 
candidate for the presidency in the October elections. "I am a 
candidate to pull the country out of economic difficulties," he 
said. "I have already told the president, in a letter I 
addressed to him, that I have no candidacy plan." 
  Concerning a possible presidential candidacy by Cardoso, 
President Itamar Franco said he received a letter from the 
finance minister in November saying he is not a candidate. "The 
important thing is the letter. The minister is thinking of his 
economic policy, his plan, particularly the plan we have 
submitted to Congress. The important thing is the letter I have. 
This does not mean he lost his citizen's rights, his right to 
vote and to be voted for. At this moment he is not a candidate, 
and he intends to finish his work at the Finance Ministry. Now 
if tomorrow he believes he has to step down, it is up to him." 
  According to the BRASIL news agency, Cardoso explained that 
sometimes it is necessary to make statements like "I will think 
about it at the right time," in order to courteously reply to a 
public demonstration promoted by his party (PSDB [Brazilian 
Social Democracy Party]), like a recent demonstration in Goiania. 
  According to the minister, he never put the political 
timetable ahead of the economic timetable, and he is certain 
that Congress will adopt the same behavior during the vote on 
the government's economic program. "There are no children in 
Congress," the minister said. He added that everyone knows that 
the country needs the program: "It is not a personal matter. 
Everyone knows I have not taken any step toward a candidacy." 
<H5>  Hargreaves </H5>
  Concerning the return to his post of former Civilian 
Household chief Henrique Hargreaves, the president said he has 
not talked about the issue. "Nothing has been agreed upon. I 
talked with Minister Hargreaves over the phone. I must know 
Hargreaves' feelings to know whether he would like to return. 
The president cannot make a unilateral decision." 
<H5>  Lula Says the Minister Is Campaigning </H5>
  The GLOBO news agency reported that PT [Workers Party] 
President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva on 17 January rebutted the 
charges pressed by Minister Cardoso, who said over the weekend 
that the PT has not designed a government plan for Brazil yet 
because it is still talking with several sectors of society. 
Lula claimed that the two popular programs under implementation 
by the Franco government -- food insurance and the 
transportation fund -- are PT programs. Lula believes Cardoso is 
campaigning. 
  During a news conference, Lula said the PT National 
Executive 
Board has proposed that the CPI's [Congressional Investigating 
Committee] that will investigate the CUT [Sole Workers Center] 
and PT campaigns should merge into a single one and should be 
set in motion as soon as possible.

  [Text] Brasilia -- After much opposition, Congress today 
starts to vote on the first amendments to the Constitution 
promulgated in 1988. The constitutional revision starts with 
the discussion of and voting on a political agenda which has 
previously been negotiated with those political parties that 
promoted the constitutional revision, and which includes a 
novelty for Brazilian voters: the end of the compulsory vote as 
of 1995. This means that in the 1996 municipal elections, each 
citizen will decide whether or not to vote. 
  One of the 15 amendments included in a draft agenda that was 
issued yesterday by Deputy Nelson Jobim (PMDB-RS) [Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party -- Rio Grande do Sul State]), 
spokesman for the revisionist congress, grants President Itamar 
Franco, current state governors, and mayors the chance to run 
for other elective posts in the next elections without having to 
resign to their current posts by April, as is established in the 
law. This amendment will be enforced as of the date of its 
publication. The constitutional revision should end by 15 
March, a mere 17 days before the deadline to resign from the 
posts. 
  With the new deadline state governors will be able to run 
for 
the presidency in the next elections, for example, without 
having to leave their posts until Octover 1994. Executive 
branch officials who hold elective posts will be allowed to seek 
reelection for one single term, but this rule will be in force 
as of 1 January 1995. Therefore, only those elected in 1996 will 
benefit from this new regulation. Jobim also proposes 
shortening the presidential term from five to four years. 
  He says: The idea is to grant more continuity to the 
government. As things stand now, one governs for only two years. 
During the first two years you learn to govern, while during 
the last you campaign for the elections. 
  The draft agenda also includes issues that will shake up the 
lives of legislators. This, according to Jobim, "only shows 
that Congress is willing to end its ailments." A legislator 
who leaves the party for which he was elected will lose his 
mandate, and will not be eligible for election for another two 
years. Another case of ineligibility includes dishonest 
handling of public affairs and immoral conduct. This will 
prevent a person like Paulo Cesar Farias, for example, from 
being elected. 
  The constitutional revision will hit the executive branch 
heavily, restricting the possibilities of its submitting 
provisional measures. The president will be unable to issue 
provisional measures on the budget or electoral rights, for 
example. 
  The 16 Proposals 
  Vote: An end to compulsory voting as of 1 January 1995. The 
spokesman argues that "the Brazilian peopole are mature enough 
to be allowed to decide for themselves whether or not to vote." 
  Reelection: Executive branch officials who hold elective 
posts are allowed to seek reelection for one single term, and to 
do so while still in office. This amendment will be enforced as 
of January 1995. 
  International rights: It regulates current international 
regulations between Brazil and other countries. 
  Incompatibility: The president, state governors, and mayors 
do not need to resign their respective posts to run for other 
elective posts. Moreover, their relatives are also eligible to 
run. This measure will be enforced as of the date it is 
published. 
  Challenging mandates: There will be a 60 day deadline, 
instead of the current 15 day deadline, for submitting a request 
to challenge an election after the date it is held. 
  Ineligibility: Those charged with dishonest handling of 
public affairs and immoral conduct are subject to ineligibility. 
  Termination of term: A legislator who leaves the party for 
which he was elected loses his mandate, and is ineligible to run 
for another two years. 
  Presidential term: It will be four instead of five years, 
with the possibility of seeking one single reelection. 
  Congressional immunity: The Federal Supreme Court (STF) may 
sue a legislator prior to congressional authorization. The case 
will be closed only if there is an absolute congressional 
majority vote in favor. Congressional immunity will encompass 
the opinions, words, and voting of legislators, and is extended 
to common crimes. 
  Provisional measures: The issuance of provisional measures 
is prohibited, and Congress has a 60 day deadline to review it 
instead of the 30 days it now has. It can only be used in 
urgent cases. It cannot be used for issues pertaining to 
complementary laws or for issues of the exclusive competence of 
Congress or those regarding nationality, citizenship, political 
or electoral rights, or the budget. 
  Military recruitment: It will continue to be compulsory. A 
military man with over 10 years of service may run for an 
elective post without having to join a political party. He only 
needs to be nominated by the party. 
  Establishment of states: The discussion starts in the local 
state legislative assembly, which immediately summons a 
plebiscite. Only then does the national Congress manifest itself. 
  Establishment of municipalities: Will be established in 
keeping with the population and minimum public income before the 
holding of a plebiscite. 
  Religious worship: The current text is maintained. 
  Maternity leave: The text establishes that pregnant 
legislators are entitled to maternity leave. 
  Nationality: It establishes that foreigners' offspring born 
in Brazil are considered Brazilian citizens. It also 
establishes that Brazilian citizens who work abroad and who are 
forced to adopt the nationality of their host country continue 
to be Brazilian citizens.

  [Text] Brasilia -- The parties that do not want the 
Constitution to be revised (PDT, PT, PSB, PC do B, and PV) 
[Democratic Labor Party, Workers Party, Brazilian Socialist 
Party, Communist Party of Brazil, and Vanguard Party] are going 
to try everything in their power today to obstruct the 
initiation of the sitting of Congress that will revise the 
Constitution. The "contras" are betting on the lack of a quorum 
to prevent voting on the articles that are to be revised. A 
total of 293 congressmen will have to be present in order to 
approve an amendment. 
  Deputy Jose Fortunati (RS) [Rio Grande do Sul State], PT 
leader in the Chamber of Deputies, said that "we are going to 
request that the quorum be verified whether we favor or reject a 
motion, because we are against a revision of the Constitution." 
  The PDT admits that it will vote in favor of a motion if the 
revisionists are able to get the 293 deputies and senators to 
make up a plenum. 
  The two parties indicate that this week, at least, there 
will 
not be a quorum. If there is a quorum they are going to ask for 
a postponement, on the basis of the argument that the quorum is 
illegitimate with the participation of the congressmen who are 
involved in the budget mafia.

  [Text] The Chamber of Deputies Special Committee yesterday 
approved most of the measures of the fiscal adjustment plan 
proposed by Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso. The 
increase of the income tax on individuals and companies was 
approved by consensus, as was the restructuring of the ITR 
[Rural Land Tax] and the creation of a tax on the distribution 
of dividends. However, the withholding of 15 percent of the 
taxes of states and municipalities and 10 percent of the IPI 
[Tax on Manufactured Products] of exporter states were rejected. 
The income expected to be earned through this source will be 
compensated for through the Cofins [social security 
contributions], through combatting tax evasion, and through the 
sale of the participation of BNDES [National Bank for Economic 
and Social Development] in several companies. The approval of 
the fiscal adjustment was celebrated as a victory by the finance 
minister, who made it understood that the URV [Real Value Unit] 
will be adopted within 15 days.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Brazil monitored through 20 
January. 
  Tax revenues were $4.541 billion in December, $1.009 billion 
more than in December 1992. Federal government revenues totalled 
$46.3 billion in 1993, an increase of 25.8 percent compared with 
1992. Average monthly revenues were $792 million than in 1992. 
(Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 10 Jan 94 p 3) 
  On 12 January, Brazil shipped 13,000 metric tons of orange 
juice to Japan. This represents 81 percent of the 16,000 metric 
tons exported by Brazilian industries to Japan in the second 
half of 1993. This is the second shipment to the port built to 
receive the product. The port was inaugurated in April 1992 when 
Brazil sent the first shipment of 13,000 metric tons. (Sao Paulo 
GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 12 Jan 94 p 15) 
  The Brazilian Coffee Exporters Federation reported on 11 
January that 1993 coffee bean exports totalled 15,083,499 sacks 
valued at $988.46 million, an increase of 5.5 percent compared 
with 1992. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 12 Jan 94 p 
15) 
  A study by the State Companies Coordination Department shows 
that the five major state-owned companies failed to transfer 
$1.8 billion in dividends to the federal government in 1992. 
Only $233 million of the $2.081 billion estimated by the 
government were transferred to the Treasury. (Sao Paulo FOLHA DE 
SAO PAULO in Portuguese 12 Jan 94 Section 1 p 9) 
  A report delivered on 12 January by Central Bank President 
Pedro Malan to the Monetary Policy Subcommission, which analyzes 
the economic plan, shows that in 1993 banks had profits of $8.9 
billion, 2 percent of the GDP, because of inflation. (Rio de 
Janeiro O GLOBO in Portuguese 13 Jan 94 p 19)

  [Text] Paris -- A Brazilian economic delegation, made up of 
private businessmen and representatives from state-run 
companies, including Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum 
Corporation], and headed by diplomat Celso Marques Vieira de 
Souza from the Foreign Ministry's Economic Promotion Department, 
is scheduled to visit Hanoi in late March to study the 
possibility of enhancing economic cooperation with Vietnam. 
  Brazil might reopen its embassy in Vietnam sometime this 
year, facilitating enhanced ties with Hanoi. The diplomats who 
will be participating in the trade delegation might discuss this 
issue with the Vietnamese. The Brazilian ambassador to 
Singapore is also the concurrent Brazilian ambassador to Vietnam. 
  Among the Asian countries, Vietnam is much in demand by 
European businessmen. The tourism industry, in addition to 
other forms of cooperation, has been developing significantly 
over the past two years. Hanoi authorities seem to be 
determined to follow the Chinese path of "market socialism," 
with an economic opening but keeping a closed political system. 
  In Vietnam there is a growth rate of 5 to 7 percent per year 
and an inflation rate of 5 percent per year. There are 72 
million inhabitants, of whom 40 percent are under 15 years of 
age. Labor costs, which are still very economical, range 
between $30 and $40 per month. Foreign capital is slowly 
returning to Vietnam. Efforts are also being made to integrate 
the country into international financial organizations. Vietnam 
is scheduled to receive an average of $2 billion per year in 
foreign investments.

  [Text] Brazilian President Itamar Franco and Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria today created a commission to fight drug 
trafficking between the two countries. President Franco was in 
Leticia, Colombia, at the Brazilian border this morning. 
  [Begin unidentified reporter recording] Tabatinga, in the 
Amazon, is a border town where Brazil ends and Colombia begins. 
It does not produce anything, and its life depends on the 
government. Leticia, in Colombia, is in the same condition. The 
difference is that Leticia is in a country where the inflation 
rate does not reach 2 percent a month. But as the two towns are 
so close, the people experience the same social problems. 
Therefore the only solution for them is joint economic 
development. 
  This is why President Itamar Franco came to Colombia to 
install with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria a neighborhood 
commission. From now on businessmen and representatives of the 
two governments will meet periodically in the border towns to 
discuss and find solutions to improving the standard of living 
of the population of the two towns. For example, the commission 
will carry out joint actions to fight cholera, and even drug 
trafficking, because a large part of the cocaine that goes to 
Europe and the United States comes from Colombian to Brazil 
through the Solimoes and Amazon Rivers. 
  In the speeches installing the commission, the presidents of 
Colombian and Brazil agreed that the union of the South American 
countries is the best way for development. [end recording]

  [Text] A PNP [Peruvian National Police] National 
Antinarcotics Directorate (Dinandro) spokesman has said that 
U.S. assistance in the fight against drug trafficking in Upper 
Huallaga has been cut back, but not eliminated. The U.S. 
Embassy also said that the U.S. Government has not suspended 
that assistance. 
  Our source said that the fact that the 10 UH-1H and Bell 212 
helicopters owned by the U.S. Department of State had been moved 
to the Pucallpa base does not mean that helicopter operations 
have been suspended. 
  It was reported that the helicopters have more space to 
operate from Pucallpa. 
  The spokesman said that if required, four helicopters can 
fly 
to Tarapoto and take Dinandro personnel to the area chosen for 
an intervention. 
  If helicopter support is required in Ciudad Constitucion 
(Junin) similar trips can be arranged. 
  It was also reported that helicopters can depart from their 
base in Pucallpa and easily reach the La Convencion (Cuzco) 
valley or Palmapampa (Ayacucho jungle zone), which are areas of 
intense coca production. 
  The sources reported that two planes that the U.S. 
Department 
of State had placed at the disposal of the Peruvian police for 
the transportation of personnel and equipment from Lima to the 
"Santa Lucia" antinarcotics base (Upper Huallaga) have already 
returned to the United States. 
  That was the reason why the climate in "Santa Lucia" was one 
of uncertainty and scarcity. 
  The Air Force was making regular flights to that base 
carrying gasoline, food, and personnel. 
  The fuel for generators used in the Upper Huallaga base, as 
well as food shipped to the PNP and FAP and the $90 per month 
incentive for police personnel assigned to Upper Huallaga, have 
also been curtailed. 
  The "Santa Lucia" base has, however, an FAP M-17 helicopter 
with greater capacity for carrying personnel, which can be used 
for helicopter antinarcotic operations. 
  It was reported, however, that those operations are 
difficult 
to carry out during these months due to the bad weather 
prevailing in the jungle zone.

  [Text] A year and four months after his imprisonment the 
image of Shining Path [SL] leader Abimael Guzman, who will spend 
the rest of his life in prison, is deteriorating in the eyes of 
dissident members of his criminal organization. 
  The number of attacks carried out by this gang on the 
birthdays of Abimael Guzman and Mao Tse Dong last December in 
Lima shows that the SL "commemorated" Mao's birthday with a 
greater number of actions than they did for "President Gonzalo," 
which demonstrates the deterioration of his image. This can be 
understood from statistics recorded by the Institute for 
National Defense Research (Iniden). 
  According to Iniden, during the second half of 1993 Shining 
Path carried out 346 actions, killing 308 people -- including 
civilian and military -- which is a lower figure compared to the 
same period of the previous year. 
  In a document sent to this newspaper, Iniden states that 
most 
of the SL actions in December were concentrated near two dates: 
3 December, Abimael Guzman's birthday, and 26 December, Mao's 
100th birthday. 
  Faithful to the purest SL style, the document states, the 
two 
"commemorations" consisted of a wave of terrorist attacks. This 
means that from 2 to 5 December the Shining Path carried out 18 
attacks, and from 24 to 29 December 24 attacks. 
  By the quality of the targets and the number of attacks, the 
document states, it can be deduced that Mao was much more 
"commemorated" than Guzman. 
  Iniden states that the attacks must not be considered as the 
Shining Path's last resort, or as isolated attacks, although "it 
must not be ignored that such low figures for SL attacks have 
not been seen since 1992." 
  In a long, thorough analysis Iniden reports that the Shining 
Path has ceased to be a threat to Peruvian political 
feasibility. It nonetheless counsels the public not to be 
overly optimistic given the escalation of its attacks. 
  The document states that for some people the new wave of SL 
violence was carried out apparently with the pretext of 
"commemorating" the birthday of Abimael Guzman and Mao's 100th 
birthday. 
  For some analysts, the escalation of the violence was meant 
to "maintain Guzman's negotiating capacity" and to make the SL 
members in prison considered political or war prisoners, in 
order to obtain their freedom once peace is "negotiated." 
  The document also points out the existence of a radical SL 
group that does not accept a solution other than continuing with 
the "armed struggle," a situation that does not allow them to 
carry out negotiations for peace. 
  "This latter group does not think in the same way as the 
imprisoned SL leaders and their followers," the Iniden document 
states.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Peru monitored through 20 
January. 
  The Spanish Government approved a $40 million loan for Peru 
that will be used to buy Spanish goods and services to implement 
a fiber optic transmission project with the participation of the 
Spanish telecommunications company Alcatel. (Lima EL COMERCIO in 
Spanish 31 Dec 93 p 1) 
  The National Institute of Statistics and Information Science 
on 31 December 1993 reported that 1993's inflation rate was 39.5 
percent, the lowest since 1977. The sectors registering the 
highest increase were: transportation and communications, 54.2 
percent; teaching and cultural services, 46.8 percent; health 
and medical services, 43.7 percent; rental, oil, and 
electricity, 43 percent. The GDP increased 6.8 percent compared 
with 1992. (Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 1 Jan 94 p 1)

  [Text] Commercial airline pilots have announced a new 
protest against aeronautical authorities due to U.S. military 
airplane overflights in Colombian territory, an issue they 
believe seriously endangers the lives of hundreds of passengers. 
  Spokesmen for the Colombian Association of Civilian Pilots 
(Acdac) have said, concerning the Barranquilla incident, two 
reconnaissance airplanes overflew the city's central zone for 
five hours, causing problems in commercial air operations 
entering and leaving the Atlantico Department capital. 
  Meanwhile, the Colombian Defense Ministry and Air Force have 
confirmed joint operations with the United States DEA on the 
Caribbean coast. 
  It was learned the military airplanes from Howard Air Force 
Base in Panama that overflew Barranquilla on 15 January were 
involved in control operations with other FAC [Colombian Air 
Force] aircraft. 
  Air Force spokesmen have said the operations were executed 
at 
22,000 feet for more than one week. 
  Following these explanations, civilian pilots have agreed 
that these types of operations may take place, provided the 
control towers are notified of the aircraft's presence and 
positions. 
  "We reject the fact the authorities, specially the FAC, do 
not require U.S. pilots to report their position and avoid 
creating chaos as it occurred 15 January in Barranquilla, when 
two reconnaissance airplanes overflew the city the entire day 
and only at dusk established contact with the control tower," 
said an Acdac pilot. 
  Moreover, presidential candidate Ernesto Samper Pizano, 
currently on tour in Barranquilla, was visibly displeased and 
upset by the presence of U.S. airplanes on the northern coast. 
  Samper has said he shares the people's views, because he 
considers as untimely this type of maneuvers in our territory. 
  He has said President Cesar Gaviria's government should 
explain the military maneuvers executed 15 January near 
Barranquilla. 
  Furthermore, Congressman Samuel Moreno Diaz, a member of the 
6th Senate Commission, which is in charge of aeronautical 
affairs, has said this new incident proves once again there is 
no control or coordination between the Civil Aeronautics Board 
and the FAC in Colombia. 
  He has said, generally speaking, the flight plans recorded 
for U.S. planes are false and a result of the flight crew's whim 
rather than the type of operation they are executing, thus 
endangering the lives of hundreds of passengers and--what is 
even sadder--violating our airspace, because Colombia lacks the 
organization to protect and exercise our sovereignty. 
  "We have reported often that the FAC has no control 
whatsoever over our airspace, and what happens many times is 
that the flight controllers in most of the country's airports 
unsuccessfully try to contact the foreign planes, yet they have 
no flight plans, and no one really knows what they are doing in 
Colombian airspace," Senator Samuel Moreno has said.

  [Text] Guerrillas presumed to be members of the FARC 
[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] on 17 January on the 
outskirts of Villavicencio kidnapped two U.S. citizens who were 
with an evangelical mission, apparently in reprisal for the 
presence of U.S. troops in Colombia. 
  According to the authorities, the subversives entered La 
Esperanza estate in the capital of Meta, subdued its residents, 
and after identifying each of them kidnapped Americans Timothy 
Bay and Stevel Welth. [names as published]

  [Text] At the request of Senator Gabriel Melo Guevara, 
acting Defense Minister General Ramon Emilio Gil Bermudez has 
delivered to him the agreements signed between the Colombian and 
U.S. Governments that allow the presence of foreign troops in 
Colombia. 
  This is the agreement signed between Colombia and the United 
States on the responsibilities and commitments the two countries 
commit themselves to with the presence of the U.S. Marines in 
Juanchaco. This agreement was reached on 29 October 1993. 
  In the memorandum signed by Minister Rafael Pardo and 
Ambassador Morris Busby, Colombia allows the U.S. group to carry 
out emergency night flights with U.S. Government planes; to use 
the port facilities at Juanchaco, the naval base at Malaga Bay, 
or any other landing strip; to use landing strips in Cali, 
Juanchaco, the naval base at Malaga Bay, or any other; to use an 
adequate field of land that could be used for landing; the same 
right to possess and carry weapons as the members of the 
Colombian Armed Forces; to coordinate through the U.S. military 
group all local and international press communiques and trips 
carried out by media representatives; authorization to enter and 
leave Colombia without any passports or visas. 
  [Begin Melo Guevara recording] They can carry weapons and 
use 
their uniforms in Colombian territory. [end recording] 
  The copy of the agreement delivered by the Defense Ministry 
to Senator Gabriel Melo Guevara also specifies that the imported 
goods purchased in Colombia by the U.S. Armed Forces are exempt 
from any inspection and will be exempted from paying any export 
tax. The luggage, personal effects, and other goods for 
personal use will also be exempted from inspection and taxes. 
  [Begin Melo Guevara recording] Colombia also commits itself 
to pick up the garbage. [end recording] 
  This is specified in Paragraph 20 that says: The Government 
of Colombia will be in charge of disposing of all garbage 
generated during the exercise.

<F P=106> [Report by Jesus Garzon for the "TV Today" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Just when the government thought the scandal over 
the U.S. forces' presence in Juanchaco had ended, the State 
Council exercised its constitutional authority and unanimously 
demanded an explanation from President Cesar Gaviria concerning 
the Marines' presence. The State Council president said Gaviria 
did not violate the Constitution if he had the Senate's 
approval; otherwise, he is in a serious situation. 
  President Gaviria has until 8 February to tell the State 
Council the truth about the U.S. forces' presence in Colombia 
and the overflights of U.S. aircraft on the country's northern 
coast. The 26 magistrates will then meet to study the situation 
and decide whether the Colombian president violated the 
Constitution. 
  For the time being, it is known that neither the Senate nor 
the State Council have been consulted by the government to allow 
the transit of U.S. soldiers through Colombian territory. 
  [Begin recording] [State Council President Amado Gutierrez] 
If the Senate has given its authorization, then he would 
obviously have no problem. 
  [Garzon] The Senate said no. 
  [Gutierrez] That is what we have to establish. [end 
recording] 
  According to the State Council, this is the first time a 
Colombian president has been questioned in connection with the 
presence of foreign troops in our country without prior approval 
from the Senate. 
  [Begin Gutierrez recording] There is no precedent for a 
State Council's ruling to allow the transit of foreign troops in 
the country. [end recording] 
  Therefore, in order to decide President Gaviria's 
culpability 
or innocence, the State Council expects to learn from the 
government under what conditions the permit was issued.[end 
recording]

  [Text] Leticia (Colombia), 22 Jan (EFE) -- Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria today rejected the wave of criticisms 
leveled against his government for allowing U.S. troops to enter 
the country for cooperation missions and asserted that Americans 
have been in Colombia since World War II. 
  The statement has prompted strong criticism of the 
government 
and president, particularly from the opposition, although some 
of the president's own party members have also been critical. 
  Gaviria said that although citizens have a right to protest, 
behind these criticisms he perceives the presence of "dark 
forces" with personal interests that include drug trafficking. 
  "I want to point out that U.S. soldiers have been in 
Colombia 
since the end of World War II. In every administration, 
military missions have provided cooperation in accordance with 
the Inter- American Reciprocal Assistance Treaty," Gaviria said. 
  Gaviria asserted that this cooperation is intended "to 
train, 
equip, and professionalize our Armed Forces in aerial matters 
and to provide cooperation in the struggle against drug 
trafficking." 
  The president said it is a paradox that while numerous 
clandestine flights "violate our sovereignty every day," such a 
fuss is being made over "cooperation requested by the Colombian 
Armed Forces." 
  "Joint engineering exercises have also been carried out, 
such 
as those in Juanchaco, those in San Jose del Guavi, and those 
under way in Puerto Lopez, where a river outpost is being built. 
Most of the residents of the regions in question want these 
projects" Gaviria said. 
  "This," he added, "does not mean that citizens should not 
demand explanations or ask why the cooperation is taking place, 
but many of the criticisms are ill-intentioned and the result of 
obscure interests linked to drug trafficking."

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 23 Jan (AFP) -- Police sources 
have reported that 29 persons died and 11 others were seriously 
wounded in an attack today by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia [FARC] in the downtown area of Apartado, in the banana 
producing area in the northwestern Province of Antioquia. 
  This is the worst carnage so far this year in Antioquia's 
Uraba region, the authorities noted. They explained that 
approximately 20 FARC men armed with rifles and machine guns 
fired indiscriminately on sympathizers of the Hope, Peace, and 
Liberty group composed of former Popular Liberation Army 
guerrillas, who three years ago demobilized and returned to 
civilian life. 
  According to initial investigations by the Antioquia Police, 
the rebels, who wore army and police uniforms, appeared in the 
La Chinita neighborhood, where a party was going on, and opened 
fire.

they were mercilessly murdered. [end recording] 
  The victims were participating in a political demonstration

<F P=106> [Report by Diego Fajardo; from the "NTC" newscast] </F>
  [Excerpt] Military troops rescued this morning Dr. Carlos 
Upegui Zapata from his captors, who were holding him in a hilly 
area between the Municipalities of Viani and Chaguani, 
Cundinamarca. 
  Carlos Upegui Zapata has lived the worst five months of his 
life in these hills. Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia 
[FARC] guerrillas had kept him moving constantly, always in the 
mountains between the Cundinamarca Municipalities of Viani and 
Chaguani. The operation that freed him began at 0550. 
  [Begin recording] [Fajardo] How were you able to rescue the 
doctor alive, considering that he was in, practically speaking, 
a guerrilla hideout? 
  [Unidentified speaker] Due to the way the operation was 
organized and due to the energy and aggressiveness the soldiers 
exhibited. [end recording] 
  One of the guerrillas died in the house in which Upegui was 
hidden; the others fled when they noticed the soldiers' presence. 
  The people of the area say this is an area of working 
peasants and that they did not know anything about the presence 
of guerrillas or kidnapped individuals. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Defense Minister Rafael Pardo was at the airport 
when he learned about the release of Carlos Upegui [a member of 
the Reintegration Commission]. This was the last news he 
received before leaving for the United States. 
  [Begin Pardo recording] The release of Dr. Upegui was the 
result of a very persistent effort, especially by the Army. 
Fortunately, he is safe and sound and will be able to join his 
family very soon. [end recording] 
  Despite the successful operation--which dealt a heavy blow 
against the guerrillas--Pardo said the number of kidnappings 
have increased for one specific reason: the unconstitutionality 
of certain decrees of the Antikidnapping Law. 
  [Beginning Pardo recording] We have said this could pave the 
way for those who want to commit kidnappings, that they would 
face fewer obstacles and restrictions; unfortunately, we see 
that kidnappers have increased their actions. [end recording] 
  Rafael Pardo went to Houston to undergo a medical checkup, 
which will allow him to continue with his recuperation. He 
hopes to be back in Colombia in February to resume his job as 
defense minister.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colombian Government Minister Fabio Villegas </F>
by Diego Hernan Canal at Narino Palace in Bogota; from the "NTC 
News" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Canal] The government has just decided to put in 
effect, as of today, a curfew in Aparatado, Turbo, Chigorodo, 
and Carepa. Mr. Minister, why is this going to be implemented? 
  [Villegas] We have decided, basically, to complement the 
decisions we have already adopted to protect life and guarantee 
calm in the Uraba region and to face this violent offensive by 
the Guerrilla Coordinating Board. In addition to the curfew, we 
have decided to strengthen our military presence there, prohibit 
alcohol consumption, suspend permits for the possession of 
weapons, speed justice procedures, and intensify efforts to 
implement the Uraba Plan. 
  [Canal] Mr. Minister, are the measures you have just 
announced enough to guarantee the elections process in Uraba and 
to reestablish public order in that region? 
  [Villegas] The idea of the government, society, and the 
people of Uraba is to carry out an elections process capable of 
strengthening democracy, enhancing that region's political life, 
and becoming a main tool for facing the Guerrilla Coordinating 
Board, which once again has made it clear, through bloodshed, 
violence, and terrorism, that it is interested in preventing the 
Hope, Peace, and Liberty Movement from gaining political support 
in this region. 
  [Canal] Thank you, Mr. Minister. In the next few days, 
decrees will be issued to authorize these measures.

  [Text] The events in Uraba have prompted the contempt and 
censure of several groups in the country, and they lifted their 
voices today to ask the government to take a stronger stand in 
solving the problem. 
  President Gaviria, at the head of the list, did not spare 
words in rejecting the guerrillas' actions, and he also 
announced that military mayors could be appointed in the region 
in the next days. 
  [Begin recording] [Gaviria] It is cowardly and knavish to 
kill poor people who reentered civilian life after the Chinita 
invasion [not further identified] in Apartado. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Is there a possibility that military 
mayors will be appointed in this region? 
  [Gaviria] Those are decisions that will be made in the 
coming 
days. 
  [Andres Pastrana, Conservative Party presidential candidate] 
Those of us who are in politics and want to do a good job are 
very concerned with the events. It is not only regrettable that 
they are occurring in the country, but it is also important that 
they be totally clarified. 
  [Humberto de la Calle, Liberal Party presidential candidate] 
I believe the situation is very serious. I believe this has 
been the worst or one of the worse things that has happened to 
us on the road to achieving peace. The possibilities of ever 
achieving it dwindles if the people who abandon their weapons 
cannot obtain protection from the government or citizens. 
  [Monsignor Pedro Rubiano] The Uraba massacre merits the 
rejection of the entire country. Heaven cries out for the blood 
of those innocent peasants and workers. 
  [Senator Enrique Gomez] National sovereignty does not exist 
in that area; the public force is totally inefficient. Justice 
has disappeared, and the government's total lack of command is 
unjustifiable. 
  [Barranquilla Mayor Bernardo Hoyos] Why can't the Colombian 
Government understand that the violence in the country cannot be 
solved from Bogota? [end recording]

  [Text] President Cesar Gaviria has just signed a decree 
whereby he freezes government workers' payroll. That means that 
as of today there will be no new appointments to government 
posts until the electoral process is concluded. The goal is to 
grant the elections honesty. Here is what Planning Director 
Armando Montenegro said: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Montenegro, 
why 
was the decision to freeze the government payroll made today? 
  [Montenegro] This is a normal decision during the period 
before the elections to guarantee impartiality. The 
appointments of employees and officials run the risk of 
mid-level officials using them for political reasons. 
  [Reporter] How long will this decision remain in force? 
  [Montenegro] This will remain in force until after the 
elections. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Adolfo Leon Mejia; from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Indignation prevails among the residents of Popayan 
over the disappearance and kidnapping of Julio Cesar Payan de la 
Roche -- doctor, journalist, and political leader. 
  The first reports indicate the president of Popayan's 
municipal council was intercepted near his farm by several men 
who forced him into a Jeep and took him to an unknown 
destination. 
  [Begin Popayan Mayor Luis Fernando Velasco recording] I hope 
the kidnappers understand they have not attacked Payan the 
doctor. They have actually attacked a whole city, which 
renounces this action and demands his immediate release. [end 
recording] 
  Hundreds of demonstrators from the M-19 Democratic Alliance 
and other movements in the department are currently gathered at 
Caldas Park to protest his kidnapping and to demand that the 
outstanding public leader promptly be released. 
  Dr. Payan was president of the municipal council. He was 
also a journalist who participated in a talk show at Radio 
Super, a local station. He attended to his patients at a 
general clinic located north of this department capital. 
  A complete mystery surrounds the disappearance of Dr. Julio 
Cesar Payan in the city of Popayan.

<F P=106> [Report by Raul Gutierrez from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The government's announcement of a reduction in the 
expense budget coincided with former President Alfonso Lopez' 
criticism of the way the economy is being handled. The budget 
reduction is taking place at a time when criticism of the 
government for excessive expenditures in the public sector has 
increased. This confirms the saying that where there's smoke, 
there's fire. 
  Finance Minister Rudolf Hommes said the goal is to reduce 
the 
fiscal deficit to zero and to leave a healthy economy for the 
next administration. 
  [Begin Hommes recording] We are guaranteeing macroeconomic 
stability this year. There will be no pressure to make changes, 
which was a valid concern for exporters. Also, there will be no 
pressure concerning interest rates because we will [words 
indistinct]. [end recording] 
  The piece cut from the budget pie includes 171 billion pesos 
in operating funds and 98 billion pesos in investment funds. 
The latter include 50 billion pesos Congress hurriedly approved 
and earmarked for the legislative expense budget. 
  When the minister was asked about former President Alfonso 
Lopez' criticism of the way the economy is being handled, Hommes 
admitted that the budget cuts are a way of correcting things, 
but he insisted that the cost of living for this year should be 
19 percent as planned rather than the 21 percent suggested by 
Lopez.

  [Text] All 30 of the country's governors met yesterday with 
President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo to voice their serious concern 
over his announcement that military mayors would be appointed to 
replace those murdered by the guerrillas. 
  Cauca Department Governor Temistocles Ortega Narvaez said 
that other more democratic means should be adopted to face the 
Guerrilla Coordinating Board violence and said that Gaviria's 
announcement is outside all constitutional order. Gaviria has 
invoked the Public Order Law. "I am convinced that all 
Colombians have to decidedly fight to strengthen democracy and 
this calls for civilian society to have the responsibility of 
guiding the state at its various levels," the governor said. 
Temistocles Ortega added that for this very reason he differs 
from the president's views that members of the Armed Forces 
should fill the vacancies in those municipalities where the 
mayors have been murdered. 
  Norte de Santander Department Governor Alvaro Salgar 
Villamizar said that the fact that a mayor is murdered justifies 
the president's reasons, but this places the president against 
the spirit of the Constitution and the mayors' popular election 
mandate. 
  Antioquia Governor Juan Gomez Martinez said that the measure 
seems extreme to him and said that in the case of Antioquia 
Department, the situation has substantially improved, including 
the Uraba banana area. 
  President Gaviria Trujillo assured all governors that they 
will have the government's full support in its struggle against 
the guerrillas and in the consolidation process for the upcoming 
elections. The president said that the Colombian guerrillas 
have their military capacity undermined and have been incapable 
of interpreting the Colombian people's wishes and have found 
less support among the population. He said that for this reason 
no one wants to listen to their outdated speeches full of 
bullets and threats, arguing that all Colombians reject the 
attack suffered by Finance and Public Credit Minister Rudolf 
Hommes. 
  The president said that those guerrillas do not know that 
Colombians must be spoken to with the language of democracy, 
respect for life, and tolerance. He said that the decided and 
clear response by the Colombian people should show those who are 
violent that their weapons do not intimidate us and that their 
crazy behavior leads us to persist in the policies that will 
lead Colombia down the path of peace and progress.

  [Text] Latin America accomplished a `paper victory' 
yesterday before the EU in winning a lawsuit against banana 
restrictions, which have been described in Colombia as 
diabolical and uncompromising. 
  The Colombian Government believes this victory has no 
practical effects, given the GATT members must unanimously 
approve the ruling. In this respect, no one expects the 12 EU 
member countries or their former colonies in Asia, Africa and 
the Pacific to vote in favor of a resolution that goes against 
their own interests. 
  Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos has lamented the 
fact a consensus favoring a withdrawal from the GATT lawsuit had 
not been accomplished. This requirement had been established by 
the EC as a precondition to improving access for banana imports. 
The foreign trade minister has insisted Colombia was always 
willing to withdraw the lawsuit and that four of the five 
complainant countries had also agreed. 
  At 1055 (local time), five minutes before the results were 
made public and the deadline to withdraw the lawsuit had 
expired, Costa Rica and Nicaragua changed their minds, however, 
and had decided to continue with the action. In this respect, 
they both decided to join Guatemala, which from the beginning 
refused to withdraw the lawsuit. 
  In other words, Colombia and Venezuela were left on their 
own. 
  According to Santos, Costa Rica justified its shift in 
position by saying the EC had not given any assurances that it 
would maintain its proposal in light of Guatemala's refusal to 
withdraw the legal action. 
  This division among the growers could result in the EC 
withdrawing its proposal to improve conditions of the current 
banana regulations. 
  In other words, Latin America's banana quota would continue 
to remain at 2 million tons, and U.S. as well as European market 
companies would retain marketing control. 
  There is still the possibility, however, of increasing the 
2.1 million tons and the EC maintaining its offer until 15 
February, according to information disclosed by a European 
official. 
  The proposal consists of increasing the banana quota to 2.1 
million tons and leaving 70 percent of the quota in the hands of 
the governments; in other words, managing the market would once 
again be in the hands of banana growers. 
  Santos has said the Latin American countries had to confront 
all sorts of pressures, saying the multinationals have aided in 
boycotting an agreement among growers. "I am aghast at the 
pressures applied by the marketing companies over certain 
countries," he said. 
  Moreover, Santos has disclosed the U.S. trade office had 
summoned the Colombian ambassador in Washington to express its 
concern, because steps taken by Colombia were harming the 
interests of several U.S. marketing companies. 
  Considering accusations of the cowardice thrown against 
Colombia by certain countries, Santos has said there is no 
cowardice in fighting to defend the 500,000 jobs the banana 
industry provides, or in challenging the multinationals. 
  The minister has reiterated that Colombia maintains its 
willingness to dialogue with the EU and the Latin American 
countries involved in the issue to search for a solution 
satisfactory to all parties involved.

  [Text] Barquesimeto -- Approximately 80,000 transportation 
workers in 11 states will initiate an indefinite transportation 
strike tomorrow on city and inter-city routes to protest the 
government's delay in resolving the problems they have been 
facing for so long. 
  Erik Zuleta, general secretary of the Lara Automotive Union, 
reported that at the meeting held by the Bloc of Transportation 
Unions of the Central and Central-Eastern States, it was agreed 
to initiate the strike as of Tuesday. This move will leave the 
following states without public transportation along city and 
inter-city routes: Tachira, Merida, Trujillo, Falcon, Zulia, 
Barinas, Portuguesa, Yaracuy, Apure, Cojedes, and Lara, as well 
as part of Carabobo. 
  Zuleta said the transportation strike will hit the nation's 
central area, the central-western region, the Andes, and the 
western flatlands. The strike will be staged indefinitely until 
the Transportation and Communications Ministry responds to a 
document turned over by Fedetransporte [expansion unknown] in 
October in which the problems of more than 80,000 transportation 
sector workers are spelled out. The demands include an increase 
in the minimum wage, the elimination of the VAT [value-added 
tax], and that the state absorb the cost of the student tariff. 
Zuleta indicated that the transportation workers are not 
willing to continue subsidizing this service that should be 
assumed by the government. 
  In addition, the secretary general of the Lara Automotive 
Union said that one of the main points for resolving the tariff 
problem is the need for the government to establish official 
tariffs for urban, suburban, metropolitan, and countryside 
transportation. The decision made by the Bloc of Transportation 
Unions has already been made. The strike will be initiated on 
Tuesday for an indefinite period until the bloc receives a 
satisfactory reply from the government. The workers have been 
waiting for this reply for three months.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Who Controls the DEA?"] </F>
  [Text] The new Social Defense secretary -- who is in charge 
of drug enforcement actions -- was asked a few days ago if he 
knew how many DEA agents operate in Bolivia. The high-ranking 
government official said he did not know. 
  Does any government official know the answer? An 
investigation by this newspaper has showed that no one can. 
Neither the Ministry of Government nor the Foreign Ministry 
really know how many DEA agents operate in Bolivia. This is 
because they are hidden among the U.S. Embassy staff. 
  This issue came into the limelight more than a year ago when 
a DEA agent wounded a Bolivian citizen in Santa Cruz. He was 
immediately expatriated. The explanation given at that time was 
that he was accredited as a diplomat. He thus had diplomatic 
immunity under which, according to the Vienna Convention, the 
host country grants immunity to representatives of the 
governments with whom it maintains relations. 
  The Vienna Convention establishes that it is not necessary 
for an embassy to inform a host government on the functions of 
its embassy personnel because it is understood that their 
activities will be strictly restricted to diplomatic norms. 
There is a clear contradiction, however, between the work done 
by the DEA agents and these norms which are being ignored by 
both the DEA and the rest of the U.S. embassy members, who on 
more than on one occasion have openly intervened in internal 
Bolivian affairs. 
  The main subject that interests us -- that is, the "safe 
houses" that the DEA keeps in several Bolivian cities where 
alleged drug traffickers are questioned -- deserves official 
explanation. 
  Claiming that the national police do not merit confidence 
because connections have been found between some officers and 
drug traffickers does not justify a third party carrying out the 
duties of the Bolivian State. 
  Both the district prosecutor and the Human Rights Assembly 
of 
Santa Cruz have said that these agents ignore Bolivian laws and 
their actions are not controlled by our national authorities who 
have limited themselves to say: "There is no smoke without 
fire." What is worse, the DEA chief refuses to receive a 
national deputy in his office to discuss the charges. 
  We must recall that this is not the first time that this 
kind 
of irregular procedures by the DEA has been made public. During 
the last administration, former Interior Minister Carlos 
Saavedra Bruno was very concerned about charges that were made 
and he said he would ask the U.S. Embassy for a report on the 
activities of these "diplomats." The subject was not discussed 
again, however, because of the election campaign flurry. But 
the fact that the issue has again come to the limelight shows 
that it cannot be controlled by our authorities. And this 
cannot be so. 
  Following the announcement that the new U.S. drug 
enforcement 
policy has ruled out the militarization of the issue and efforts 
will be concentrated on police interdiction -- which certainly 
is good news -- it is necessary to establish clear rules that 
must be respected by any kind of foreign "advisers" in this 
field. Beside preserving our national sovereignty on such a 
sensitive subject, the establishment of an agreement will help 
the two countries to maintain relations in an atmosphere of 
mutual respect.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 23 Jan (NA) -- Foreign Ministry 
Secretary General Andres Cisneros has said that if Argentina 
continues with its present policies over the Malvinas Islands, 
"inevitably, some day, it will discuss the issue of sovereignty 
with Great Britain in a nontraumatic way." 
  Cisneros justified Argentina's policy of approach to the 
Malvinas Islanders saying: "The better the Malvinas Islanders 
get along, the more they exploit their own resources, the 
quicker they will realize that they can only do it with us. 
They will realize they can grow economically and as a society 
associating themselves with the only neighbor God gave them on 
earth, that is, us." 
  He flatly denied to Radio Continental that such approach 
policy showed government "weakness," adding that he is convinced 
the policy "will inevitably lead to a discussion of the 
sovereignty issue in a nontraumatic way." 
  Cisneros praised the Argentine Government decision to 
propose 
to the British Government the removal of the mine fields buried 
on the islands during the 1982 war. 
  "When offering to cooperate in the removal of the mines that 
we planted we are not just fulfilling international norms that 
almost no one else respects, but we are giving an example to the 
world about the civilized behavior of a country that has been at 
war with another but which does not want to kill civilians 
unwillingly after the war ended," Cisneros said. 
  "The work of removing mines is not easy, but neither is it 
impossible," Cisneros said, adding that "Argentine technology is 
good to manufacture and to clean a mine field and we are well 
prepared for the job." 
  The official said: "The lesson Argentina and Great Britain 
are giving the world on the civilized way to proceed after a war 
is exceptional." 
  Cisneros said: "Although international treaties mention it, 
very few countries do what Great Britain is doing in the 
Malvinas Islands; investigating their own alleged war crimes." 
  Cisneros confirmed that U.S. President Bill Clinton is 
intent 
on organizing a summit with the presidents of all the Americas, 
except Cuba and Haiti, adding that "U.S. foreign policies during 
the past five years have tended to include guidelines on the 
entire region." 
  "They are integrating proposals that seek to create links 
with the rest of the Americas to determine consistent policies 
for the entire continent," Cisneros said, adding that 
"corruption and poverty are two issues that concern U.S. and 
Argentine foreign policy the most." 
  Regarding the negotiation between Argentina and the United 
States for the purchase of Skyhawk planes equipped with state of 
the art radar, Cisneros admitted that negotiations will remain 
"deadlocked" until a new defense minister is designated in the 
United States. 
  "The issue will probably be delayed until the U.S. 
Government 
appoints a new defense minister, but Foreign Minister Guido Di 
Tella and Defense Minister Oscar Camilion are quite optimistic 
about obtaining a good result," the official said. 
  Regarding the free trade treaty (NAFTA) between the United 
States, Mexico, and Canada became effective on 1 January, 
Cisneros said we still do not know "if the treaty will remain 
with just those three countries or if it will incorporate" other 
nations in the continent. 
  Cisneros said that Argentina "must now give priority to our 
own economic regionalization process -- Mercosur [Common Market 
of the South]" -- which "does not exclude NAFTA."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 24 Jan (NA) -- Upon arriving here on 
an official visit, Chilean Defense Minister Patricio Rojas said 
this morning that his country "is not worried" about the 
purchase of airplanes or any other type of materiel by the 
Argentine Armed Forces. 
  Rojas was met by Argentine Defense Minister Oscar Camilion; 
Lieutenant General Mario Candido Diaz, the joint staff chief; 
and other Defense Ministry officials and military leaders. 
  The Chilean minister will remain here just a few hours, as 
he 
is scheduled to return to Santiago this afternoon after meeting 
with Camilion and lunching at the Alvear Palace Hotel. 
  In remarks to the journalists, the two defense ministers 
ruled out the possibility of discussing the Laguna del Desierto 
border problem. 
  For his part, Camilion said the purchase of the A-4 Skyhawk 
planes will be decided during the meetings that Foreign Minister 
Guido Di Tella will hold with U.S. officials in the United 
States. 
  Camilion also confirmed a donation by the United States of 
three Hercules C-130 planes that will possibly arrive in 
Argentina before the end of the month.

  [Text] President Carlos Menem obtained yesterday a clear 
political victory by getting the provinces of Neuquen and Rio 
Negro to join the fiscal pact. 
  After two days of negotiations in the Chapadmalal tourist 
resort, the government was able to get practically all the 
provinces to join the economic and fiscal guidelines of the 
central power. 
  Eduardo Angeloz [Cordoba Province governor] thus remained 
the 
single "rebel" governor who has not yet signed the pact drawn up 
by Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo. But the legislature of 
Corrientes Province must also decide whether or not it will 
approve the signing of the pact by Ideler Tonelli, who was then 
the trustee of that province. 
  Intense negotiations were carried out by Domingo Cavallo, 
presidential General Secretary Eduardo Bauza, and Interior 
Minister Carlos Ruckauf to get Neuquen Governor Jorge Sobisch 
and Rio Negro Governor Horacio Massaccesi to sign the pact. 
  Bauza himself later denied that pressure was exerted on the 
two governors, saying that the agreement with Neuquen and Rio 
Negro "considers the interests of the nation and of each 
province."

<F P=106> [Article by Japan-based Peruvian economist and journalist </F>
Marco Kamiya: "What Can Peru Expect From Japan?"] 
  [Text] "Peru at a Crossroads," "Fujimori's Country on Its 
Deathbed," "Authoritarianism: The Only Alternative." Sound 
familiar? These are the titles of a number of editorials 
frequently appearing in the Japanese press. After learning the 
results of the referendum, leading economic news daily NIHON 
KEIZAI SHIMBUN was even more dramatic: "Fujimori deserves 
Japan's help in continuing his revitalization of Peru." 
  It is a good sign. In 1989 and 1990, Peru was always linked 
with news about terrorism, cocaine, and Machu Picchu. Since the 
election of the "Nisei" president, Peru has merited a special 
place in the media. Every event brings in correspondents and 
sets off a wave of frantic telephone calls requesting 
information. In terms of editorials, Fujimori and Clinton are 
neck-and-neck. 
  Nevertheless, Japan's interest is more sentimental than 
real. 
The government has not funded enormous loans and businessmen do 
not view Peru as an immediate investment possibility. 
  Nor have Tokyo's bureaucrats done much for Peru. Following 
the killing of three Technical Cooperation engineers by 
terrorists, the government suspended its technical exchanges 
with the JICA [Japanese International Cooperation Agency] 
program. 
  As for loans and the remission of debts, Japan conducts its 
negotiations through the IMF and World Bank, organizations in 
which Japan maintains an economic presence but has no 
decision-making power, as a result of which its ability to apply 
pressure in favor of a country such as Peru is limited. Japan 
could also be accused of favoritism and thereby create problems 
with its trading partners if it defends Peru. 
  There remain the nonrepayable cooperation loans, which are 
minimal and used to guarantee sales of Japanese products in 
Peru. In such cases, Japan loans money to Peru in order to 
enable it to buy products from Matsushita or NEC. It is just a 
form of insurance for those companies' sales abroad. 
  Nor does business offer any brighter prospects. Although 
Keindaren, the Federation of Economic Organizations, has 
publicly stated its interest in Peru, businessmen say privately 
that the best policy for the time being is to see what happens. 
Annual meetings of Japanese and Peruvian businessmen have also 
been organized, the site alternating between Japan and Peru, but 
enthusiasm has not grown. 
  This is but a reflection of the trend with respect to Latin 
America. In 1991, Eximbank, Japan's Export-Import Bank, did a 
survey of 115 leading Japanese businesses to ascertain their 
investment plans for 1992 and 1993. Some 26 percent said they 
would channel their investments to Europe, another 25 percent to 
Asia, and 19 percent to the United States. Only 3 percent were 
considering investing in Latin America. In addition, Peru is 
rapidly forgotten when the Japanese view Chile as a growing 
market and Colombia as the central pole for the expansion of 
telephone systems in South America. Mexico is creating great 
expectations as a result of its participation in the Free Trade 
Agreement with the United States and Canada. 
  What are the determining factors for Japanese investment 
abroad? The prime factor worldwide is the advantages to be 
derived from ownership, meaning large-scale economies, 
technological advantages, and high-level administrative 
training. In second place are locational factors, i.e., barriers 
to export markets and the availability of cheap labor and 
natural resources. Ranking third are factors relating to 
internationalization, meaning the possibility of controlling the 
risk of losing technological control, easy terms for the 
repatriation of capital, and administrative simplification for 
setting up systems similar to the Japanese keiretsu. 
  Based on these elements and leaving the United States and 
West Europe aside, Southeast Asia meets all the requirements 
mentioned, followed by the former Socialist satellite countries, 
Latin America and, lagging far behind, Africa. 
  In Latin America, the Japanese are less demanding. Before 
investing, their demands can be summed up in three additional 
conditions: 1) economic stability, meaning low inflation, the 
obtainment of development plans, and low or "manageable" trade 
union activity; 2) security against terrorist action aimed at 
companies as well as individuals; and 3) political stability, 
mainly meaning strong governments that can guarantee stable 
rules of play in medium- and long-range terms. Business's 
perception is that Peru was on its way to meeting the first two 
conditions, but still had a way to go on the third, about which 
doubt remained. 
  Shigeo Osonoi, professor at the Toyama University of Foreign 
Studies and formerly a Japanese diplomat in Peru, thinks the 
Japanese are very cautious and hopes the United States and 
Europe will go in first to test the waters. Japan always goes in 
later. If the Americans are enthusiastic about Peru, the 
Japanese will get on the band wagon, Osonoi adds. 
  Economic relations have been maintained--not expanded--but 
the figures show that they do not amount to much. For Peru, 
Japan is the second-ranking buyer of Peruvian products after the 
United States. As a seller, it comes in fifth after the United 
States, Argentina, Brazil, and Germany. Japan's imports from 
Peru total less than 1 percent and its exports amount to 5 or 6 
percent (Chunanbei Shokoku Shiran 1992, Latin American Company, 
Tokyo). 
  Although in historical terms, Japanese accumulated 
investments are sizable (from 1950 to 1990, Peru ranked fifth in 
Latin America, with $41.48 million), the situation has grown 
stagnant. From 1985 to 1990, the figure amounted to a scant $20 
million, which comes out to 0 when the total statistics are 
calculated. From 1990 to 1992, rather than speaking of 
investments, one would refer to the reinvestment of the profits 
of companies already operating in the country (Panorama of 
Industry and Japanese Economic Cooperation 1992, Latin American 
Company, Tokyo). 
  While the economy has not been a very active channel between 
Japan and Peru, diplomacy has endeavored to fill the vacuum. 
Japan is the country that has put the most pressure on Fujimori 
to restore legal order and constitutional rights after the 
imposition of special powers [autogolpe]. The reason is clear: 
Japan feels a certain degree of responsibility to Peru, but does 
not want to suffer in the international community for supporting 
a regime that could carry its authoritarianism to extremes. 
  Japan has always seconded the United States on international 
issues. Only in three cases--all of them in Latin America--has 
it opposed it: In Panama with Noriega, Japan did not impose 
sanctions despite the American request to do so. During the war 
in the Falkland Islands, it did not suspend commercial trade 
with Argentina until events were well under way. Finally, in the 
case of the "Fujicoup," it strongly resisted pressure to break 
off relations. Such a defense implies risks. If there are 
excesses, Tokyo could find itself in the delicate position of 
having to defend the government before the international 
community, endangering its possibilities of winning a seat on 
the UN Security Council, damaging its relations with the United 
States, and hurting its prospects of heading up a power bloc in 
Asia. 
  At Japan's suggestion, Kabun Muto, then minister of foreign 
relations, went to Venezuela in April to help restore relations 
between Peru and Venezuela and, speaking off the record, 
expressed the need for Fujimori's government to "legitimize 
itself" by restoring Parliament so as not to be seen as a 
civilian dictator. It is to be hoped that in the diplomatic 
field, Japan will continue to maintain a low profile while 
adopting a wait-and-see attitude. 
  Obviously, feelings count for very little in international 
policy. Japanese capital and the official aid accompanying it 
are governed by the simple laws of profitability. In Chile, the 
minister of economy is also Japanese, but it is obvious that 
that is not the reason why the main investments are channeled in 
that direction. If political and economic stability can be 
achieved in medium-range terms and if the government forms a 
base of support by managing to rallying a certain social 
consensus, the investments will flow. For Japanese private 
capital, that is the most convincing argument. 
  For the time being, the only thing anyone knows for sure is 
that Peru will continue to make the front page of Japanese 
newspapers.

<H5>  Peruvians in Japan: Nontraditional Export </H5>
  In 1992, Peruvians working in Japan (the descendants of 
Japanese) sent home to Peru anywhere between $80 million and 
$150 million. For the past five years, Peruvian labor has been 
the main nontraditional product exported to Japan. 
  It is an enormous sum for Peru. For example, in 1992, the 
value of Peruvian products exported to Japan amounted to 
approximately $600 million. Some 80 percent of those products 
were minerals, 15 percent agricultural products such as coffee 
and cacao, and 5 percent manufactured products, basically 
textiles. Since the mid '80's, trade in the so-called 
nontraditional exports has wavered between 5 and 8 percent. The 
amount of money Peruvians send home to Peru could exceed the 
revenue obtained from exporting coffee or textiles to Japan. 
  According to unofficial sources in the Peruvian Embassy, 
some 
70,000 Peruvians are living in Japan. According to the 
Immigration Office in Lima, 60,000 have left. In 1989, that 
figure was 10,000. This means that the number has risen by 8,000 
a year! 
  Over half of the so-called dekasegui send--or were 
sending--anywhere between $350 and $1,500 a month to Peru. All 
of these figures are approximate because no statistics exist. 
According to some estimates, over the past four years, 
Brazilians (now numbering around 150,000) have sent a total of 
$2 billion to their relatives. 
  It is hoped that the amount of money sent will drop 
drastically in the months ahead. As a result of the recession, 
there is no work in factories, forcing many to return to their 
native countries.

<F P=106> [News Conference by Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro </F>
and Honduran President Rafael Callejas with foreign and domestic 
reporters and an unidentified moderator at the Presidential 
Palace in Managua; broadcast in progress -- live] 
  [Text] [Callejas]...always with the Nicaraguan people and 
we want it to continue. That is why I have no doubts, as I told 
Mrs. Violeta, that we are going to do everything possible to 
clear up this delicate matter. 
  [Chamorro] My dear journalist, as for your question on 
whether I have confidence in the future so as to continue 
working, I can tell you I am confident because, thank God, all 
decisions made are honestly, freely, and democratically, and we 
are going to be very friendly with the future presidents who are 
elected in each country. I am confident of this and besides, I 
believe the outgoing presidents will tell the incoming 
presidents that they should maintain strong friendship with all 
the Central American presidents for the sake of our peoples. 
That is why I am not concerned about that. Everything we do is 
for the welfare of Nicaraguans, Hondurans, Salvadorans, Costa 
Ricans, and Guatemalans. 
  [Moderator] We can take two more questions, considering the 
president must leave now. Daniel Croto from REUTER and Roberto 
Vargas from Radio Mundial. 
  [Croto] Good evening, a question for President Callejas. I 
would also like to ask him about the guerrilla commander, known 
as El Chacal. During the Honduran election campaign, the 
Nicaraguan media quoted the Nicaraguan Army as saying that El 
Chacal had entered Honduran territory. The Honduran Army 
confirmed his presence but later denied it. My question is if 
(?politics) is generating the information we are receiving on 
this case? 
  [Callejas] I met with AFP and Univision representatives and 
both told me that the so-called El Chacal was a Honduran. If 
that is the case, it would be a whole different situation if he 
were in our country. I actually think we are giving too much 
importance to a situation that does not have any significance in 
my country. I personally have not received any report from any 
government source about the existence of this gentleman. As I 
told the journalist who asked me the same question, we in 
government have no knowledge of the whereabouts or the actions 
of El Chacal. 
  I can tell you frankly that we have no reason to avoid 
releasing that information. I asked the foreign minister and we 
have had no military intelligence reports. I have no information 
of any kind. The only information I have received about El 
Chacal in the past few months came from a Univision journalist 
and an AFP journalist. 
  [Moderator] Roberto Vargas and [name indistinct] after him. 
  [Vargas] Mr. President Rafael Leonardo Callejas, as a 
Nicaraguan I am proud to have you in my country. For the two 
years I lived in Honduras I was treated well. My question is the 
following: We are alarmed about drug trafficking. We have four 
cartels in Managua. A drug trafficking cartel was caught near 
Atahualinca. I would like to know if you could give our 
Nicaraguan Army or our National Police some type of training so 
they can better locate drug traffickers. Apparently we do not 
have that many well-trained people. 
  I would also like to ask her excellency, the president of 
the 
Republic, who loves us so much, a question: Could you ask the 
DEA for technical assistance to train young men, people who want 
to work and locate drug traffickers? 
  [Chamorro] Could you repeat your last question please? I did 
not hear it, perhaps because of the echo here. 
  [Vargas] I also have voice problems. Could you ask the DEA 
for technical assistance to train policemen so they can locate 
drugs. Drugs enter Managua and the police never find out about 
it. 
  [Callejas] As for the drug trafficking problem in the 
Central 
American and Caribbean region, I would like to note that there 
are a series of agreements signed among ourselves. The Central 
American region has an agreement to fight drug trafficking. This 
agreement, which includes all Central American countries, also 
has direct relations with Venezuela, Colombia, Mexico, and the 
DEA. We are all part of a program in the fight against drug 
traffickers. There are even radar installations that cover the 
Caribbean, and there are information service installations at 
the U.S. Southern Command. 
  All Central American countries are making a great effort to 
fight drug trafficking. It is a difficult fight because, while 
the drug traffickers have economic resources, the Central 
American countries have huge limitations. The latest U.S. 
foreign policy decisions do not emphasize the fight against drug 
trafficking as much as in the past. It concentrates more on the 
producing countries, and therefore, all Central American 
countries must make a common effort because drug trafficking has 
no borders. 
  There are agreements, there are direct relations, and I 
would 
like to say that what one reads in the media are police success 
stories in this fight in each one of our countries. There was an 
important drug seizure in Honduras and Nicaragua recently. The 
effort done by the Honduran police against this scourge of 
society is very important despite the huge limitations. 
  [Chamorro] As president of Nicaragua, I can tell you we 
have an agreement with the United States under which we will 
continue helping as they continue helping us. A large number of 
drug trafficker have been identified, who, by the way, are under 
arrest. Besides, my dear journalist friends, I wanted to tell 
you I believe that all Nicaraguans, as President Rafael Leonardo 
Callejas has just said, have to work to produce. As good 
reporters you should report to the authorities when something 
wrong is going on. We should help each other as [words 
indistinct] in this field. We all have to get down and work for 
our nation to achieve peace and tranquillity. No one should be 
abusing or selling drugs. I condemn all of these things that are 
taking place. We all have to work for our fatherland. 
  [Moderator] [words indistinct] 
  [Unidentified reporter] My questions are to President 
Callejas. With regards to the meeting with Nicaraguan 
businessmen, with the participation of both governments, what 
was discussed at this working luncheon? Will there be any 
investments by Honduran businessmen in Nicaragua and by 
Nicaraguan businessmen in Honduras? Also, what will you do once 
you turn over power in Honduras? The last question is regarding 
a recent report on missing Hondurans during the 1980's involving 
some Argentine military personnel and former Nicaraguan recontra 
members. What about this, and was this issue discussed in 
Managua? 
  [Callejas] First, I am going to start by answering the 
easiest question. What am I going to do once I turn over power? 
I am going on vacation. Second, some Honduran businessmen did 
come to Nicaragua. Nevertheless, that meeting -- given that I am 
about to conclude my term -- was fundamentally to thank the 
Nicaraguan Government and people for the enormous respect they 
have shown the Honduran Government and people. My special thanks 
to Dona Violeta for her meaningful expressions of friendship 
toward me. I wanted to pay a courtesy visit to the Nicaraguan 
Government and people, especially to Dona Violeta Barrios de 
Chamorro, before I concluded my administration. 
  With regard to the third issue, in effect the Human Rights 
Commissioner in Honduras issued a report with a series of 
comments. The Reconcilation Commission that emerged from the 
Esquipulas Agreement has decided this report should be turned 
over to the Prosecutor General's Office to study the 
corresponding actions to be taken within the legal framework.

  [Text] Dear viewers, we interrupt our programming for a 
last-minute report: In the struggle for power, the Nationalist 
Liberal Republican Movement [Molirena] moments ago decided to 
support the alliance made up of the National Renewal Movement 
[Morena] and the Civic Renewal Party. 
  Molirena, Morena, and the Civic Renewal Party have formed an 
alliance to promote the candidacy of Ruben Dario Carles for 
president of the Republic. Julia Elena Alvear interviewed a top 
Molirena leader: 
  [Begin recording] [Molirena President Alfredo Ramirez] 
Molirena's Political Committee decided unanimously to recommend 
to the party's convention the candidacy of Professor Ruben Dario 
Carles for president of the Republic. 
  [Alvear] What happened in the past few hours? Apparently no 
agreement was reached with the Arnulfist Party? 
  [Ramirez] We failed to reach an agreement with other groups, 
but we did reach an agreement with the person who is now our 
presidential candidate, Professor Carles. 
  [Alvear] Mr. Ramirez, do you think you will win with 
Professor Carles? 
  [Ramirez] Yes, or we would not have chosen him. If we did 
not consider him a trump card, we would not have chosen him. 
  [Alvear] What about the alliances? 
  [Ramirez] We will be allied with the parties that are 
already supporting Carles and other parties that I am sure will 
also support his candidacy. 
  [Alvear] What about Mr. Guillermo Ford? 
  [Ramirez] He is among the greatest men of Molirena. He has 
been applauded and supported by the entire party for his 
unselfish attitude. [applause] Guillermo Ford is among the 
greatest figures in Panamanian politics and among the most 
prominent figures of Molirena. [applause] [end recording]

the Civic Renewal Party and the National Renewal Movement, at 
ceremony proclaiming his candidacy in Panama City on 16 January] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  1. State and National Governments </H5>
  On 8 May 1994, for the first time in more than 25 years, 
Panamanians will have the opportunity to vote in elections that 
will be free of military leadership or other denigrating 
practices. 
  The future of our nation will be determined, to a great 
extent, by the results of those elections. That is why 
everyone's participation is so important, and the ceremony that 
gathers us here today corroborates this. Our country wants a 
change. Our country demands a responsible government that will 
make decisions; a government capable of resolving the problems 
we are currently facing and capable of seeking solutions that 
will make it possible for the Panamanian people to establish 
modern and dynamic public institutions in order to strengthen 
democracy, create jobs, fight corruption, and eradicate poverty. 
  The government and people must advance with wisdom, taking 
advantage of the historical moment Panama and all of mankind are 
currently facing, eradicating indifference, corruption, 
skepticism, and the lack of faith in national goals. We must 
avoid having to pay the high cost hanging negatively over civic 
and moral values, which is absolutely necessary to build a solid 
future for Panamanian society. At present there is a dangerous 
imbalance in our social life which must be eliminated in order 
to timely prevent internal commotions that would only broaden 
and deepen the problems that cause them. This means reducing 
economic inequality and poverty and at the same time restricting 
sinecures, special concessions, and privileges to certain 
groups. It also means joining efforts, developing our ideas, 
and multiplying our activities to fight unemployment. 
  As we approach the 21st century, Panama must make very 
serious decisions that will lead the country toward the overall 
development of its entire potential in order to find once and 
for all the path leading to an effective solution of the current 
social, economic, and political problems. 
<H5>  2. Reaffirmation of Democracy </H5>
  Panamanians will not be able to make our democratic 
convictions a reality unless we express our firm desire and 
determination to establish and offer a good government organized 
with order and in accordance with the best techniques and 
practices of an efficient public administration. We must leave 
behind the selfish practice of distributing political positions 
and instead seek the participation and incorporation of the most 
capable men and women, youths and adults. 
  We need a state in which, with everyone's participation, the 
government is really and scientifically at the service of the 
nation. We need an efficient government that will use state 
properties and resources to the country's benefit. It should 
adopt firm and timely decisions that should always be 
implemented technically and honestly, placing national interests 
above any personal or partisan interests. 
  We need a government that can achieve greater and more 
defined cooperation among the government branches, where public 
expenditures are made in a more dynamic way, making the best use 
of funds and producing enough savings for the public projects 
and investments required both in the cities and in rural areas 
to create new jobs and to fight poverty. 
  We need a serious, credible government in which the 
Panamanian people can participate and place their confidence 
with the certainty they will receive the replies they demand and 
need: work, adequate income, education, health, housing, 
transportation, security, justice, total freedom, and equal 
opportunities regardless of sex. That requires fiscal discipline 
and balanced budgets, which are the basis for financial 
stability. 
  Indian groups will have full participation and will be given 
priority in government actions, with respect for their 
traditions, language, and customs. The implementation and 
respect for international agreements and accords signed and 
ratified by Panama on the subject of human rights will be a rule 
of conduct for the government and its officials. 
<H5>  3. Progress and Economic Development </H5>
  World changes and technological advance, the globalization 
of 
economy, and the progress of nations demand that power be 
exercised with responsibility and honesty, not only in the 
public sector, but in the private sector as well. It is 
necessary to promote and encourage -- seriously and based on 
reality -- the investment of national and foreign capital, as 
well as the consolidation of an informal economy that will 
encourage and promote medium, small, and micro enterprises, 
which can generate new activities and jobs. 
  Productivity, efficiency, and producing at maximum capacity 
in the various economic sectors are essential factors to support 
the country's economic growth and development. The comparative 
advantages of our country's geographic position, as well as its 
interoceanic region with all the existing infrastructure and the 
already or next to be reverted properties demand a capable, 
vigorous, strong, honest, and modern government that will take 
upon itself the urgent national task of productively, 
immediately, intelligently, and thoroughly exploiting all our 
advantages to the benefit of Panama and the Panamanians so that 
unemployment will no longer be the ghost that lingers over the 
homes of hundreds of thousands of compatriots. 
  A well-sketched plan and permanent actions to reduce 
unemployment must be implemented immediately so that the 
benefits and economic activities will really reach all national 
sectors, giving Panamanians opportunities for a better life. 
  Each and every one of the economic resources must be used 
for 
the country and its people's overall development. Therefore, we 
believe in the urgent need to break the two Panamas scheme that 
the concentration of economic activity in the interoceanic 
region has promoted. This is a determining factor in efforts 
being conducted to reduce unemployment and the levels of poverty 
and will contribute to finding solutions for the other social 
problems that also demand attention for the primary sector of 
the economy, with emphasis on agriculture and livestock, 
ecology, reforestation, and agro-industries. Those sectors must 
receive adequate and reasonable protection when justified and 
when it can contribute to increasing exports. 
  The recognition of the enormous foreign public debt the 
Panamanian State inherited from previous governments cannot be 
evaded. Its payment, however, must be subordinated to the 
country's economic and financial conditions so that the service 
charges for that debt will not affect Panama's development or 
the attention of the Panamanian people's urgent, basic, and 
permanent needs. No Panamanian should feel that his social 
rights are affected by the payment of the debt. 
<H5>  4. Education for Change </H5>
  The future of Panama depends more and more on our capacity 
to 
accept that we are confronting a world that -- without 
neglecting the cultural aspect -- is becoming more technical and 
scientific. We must emphasize these aspects and update our 
science and technology. 
  Strengthening the education of our children and our youth 
with that criteria is the only solid base for creating citizens 
that are useful to themselves, their family, their country, and 
the world. Our best efforts should be committed to attaining 
national education that will offer both students and teachers 
all the appropriate instruments that are indispensable for 
permanent improvement in the technical, professional, 
scientific, and cultural fields. 
  Actions in the education field should also have the goal of 
recovering ethical and moral values, national traditions, 
improving the culture of the Panamanian people, and in teaching 
new careers, professions, and techniques. The educational 
reform should take into consideration the recommendations and 
proposals presented by the teachers themselves in a detailed 
study they have presented in this respect. Our university 
system is becoming increasingly distant from the technological 
and scientific realities of today's world, as well as from the 
job markets of the present and future. Thus, this all demands a 
thorough reorganization of its research, scientific, and 
academic work so that it can comply with its true mission and 
offer society well-trained personnel, as well as qualified and 
capable technicians and scientists that will fully join national 
development. 
  Eradicating illiteracy should go hand in hand with a 
permanent educational, technical, and professional improvement 
of the entire population. No Panamanian should be deprived of 
the right to an education. Public entities such as the IFARHU 
[Human Resources Education and Training Institute], Inaforp 
[National Institute for Professional Training], and IPHE 
[Panamanian Special Rehabilitation Institute] should be 
strengthened, expanded, and modernized, offering them and 
promoting the effective use of the resources and facilities 
necessary for their activities at a national level. 
  Improvements should be made to the existing educational 
centers for training workers, farmers, and technicians, such as 
the INA [National Institute of Agriculture] and other 
professional training schools such as the Professional and 
Technical Institute. The educational efforts set forth by 
private enterprise and the church should also be worthy of 
permanent recognition and support. 
<H5>  5. Women, Children, and Family </H5>
  In their eagerness to find jobs, Panamanian families have 
gradually separated and children have left school and jeopardize 
their lives in search of an income to survive. 
  Responsible fatherhood can only be achieved through the 
individual's full education as a primary cell of the family, 
which is the main nucleus of society. Such an education can 
only be accomplished where there is an educational system for 
that fundamental purpose. 
  The role of women, as well as their full participation in 
all 
public and private tasks and duties, should not be 
underestimated at any level of government activity. National 
codes and laws will be duly corrected so that every form of 
discrimination against women will cease. In the area of labor, 
particularly, job creation plans must be developed to guarantee 
womens' rights and the principle of equal salary for equal labor. 
  However, what we do for men and women to promote their full 
development as citizens will be worth nothing if we fail to 
understand that the Panamanians of the future are our children. 
It is to them that we will direct our top priorities, ensuring 
their education and teaching them through examples and values 
what it is to be good citizens who love their country and 
universal peace. 
<H5>  6. Opening Ourselves to the World for Our Benefit </H5>
  Panama should play its role in worldwide society without 
neglecting to obtain benefits for the Panamanian people and 
meeting their needs and realities. Thus, we must consolidate 
and expand our international relations, establish a modern and 
pluralist foreign policy and work on improving our services 
abroad by, among other things, increasing commercial activities 
that will generate jobs in and from the Colon Free Zone in a 
serious, orderly, and responsible manner. Panama must also 
develop the international oil business and expand port 
activities and the transshipment and handling of containers and 
products en route to international markets from Panamanian ports 
and airports, while supporting the national aeronautical 
industry as well as promoting tourism and ecological tourism. 
  The national government's central and foremost motivation 
under my leadership will be the creation of mechanisms that will 
foster the permanent creation of new jobs, permanent 
contributions from the international economy's upward trend to 
the strengthening and broadening of Panama's banking and 
financial center, as well as the protection and promotion of 
Panamanian stock companies and international merchant marine, 
and the creation, among other things, of an international 
maritime center. 
<H5>  7. A Stable Panama With an Efficient Canal </H5>
  Panama must have a properly organized government through 
which to play a predominant role in the new international order 
that has emerged and is in a permanent process of 
transformation, while guaranteeing the administration, 
operation, and effective and stable maintenance of the Canal by 
Panamanians. 
  Thus, it is essential for the state's economic and legal 
structures to have stable and modern foundations and to be 
flexible enough to enter into the accelerated process of 
innovation and privatization which from day to day affects every 
area of human endeavor and offers new prospects for the creation 
of jobs. 
  Within this context, the new government must be prepared to 
redefine Panama's economic and commercial relations with the 
United States of America, including among its duties as a 
sovereign country the leasing for fixed periods of facilities or 
bases in our country, so that we can ensure preferential 
treatment for Panamanian products and services in U.S. markets 
and thereby increase employment opportunities for Panama's 
youths. 
  The promotion in our country of agricultural, cattle 
breeding, maritime, commercial, craft, and industrial activities 
as well as the possession of other types of properties, 
securities, and wealth, are closely tied to the reconfirmation 
and maintenance of our monetary system and our total freedom of 
exchange and foreign currency. Therefore, financial and 
monetary stability is essential to the economy's development, as 
is Panama's inclusion in NAFTA in a way that will guarantee 
improved living conditions and jobs for our people and 
improvements in the worldwide services offered by Panama and its 
interoceanic canal. 
<H5>  8. Security and Authority </H5>
  The task of eradicating violence, social crime, and all 
types 
of national or international organized crime -- including drug 
trafficking and its addiction -- should rest on a system of 
equal administration of justice for all, which will act in 
defense of rights and democratic liberties, and which will not 
allow any impunity. 
  The principle of authority within the framework of an 
effective modernization of our legislation will be the guarantee 
that all citizens will become guards of democracy. 
  We must solve the problems of coexistence while increasing 
improvement of society. We then need to have a better and more 
effective cooperation among the branches of public power, as 
well as a thorough reorganization and modernization of our 
judiciary, police, prison, and fiscal systems so that the 
citizen will be a subject and not an object of the same. 
  The Attorney General's Office, specifically, should be 
purged 
and reorganized as soon as possible so that it will comply with 
its tasks in defense of the citizens. We need officials who 
will comply with the law very strictly and who are efficient in 
their administrative duties. 
  The administration of justice, based on equality before the 
law, without detriment to public liberties, and based on the 
guarantees of due process and inalienable human rights, must not 
be tolerant of crime or criminals, and it must eradicate the 
practice of criminal impunity. 
  The Public Force must agree to accept reorganization with 
truly civilian goals. All of its personnel must have a civilian 
mentality, inspired and guided in an authentic vocation at the 
service of society, whose protection and security are its main 
purposes. 
  In an effort to improve the services of security and public 
order, it is indispensable to approve a National Police 
organizational law and reorganize the Police Academy with a 
scientific and civilian mentality, both for the law enforcing 
units and the police officers, as well as for the training of 
PTJ [Judicial Technical Police] officers, the customs officials, 
and other specialized entities. 
<H5>  9. A State at the Service of the Citizens </H5>
  The Panamanian people are hoping for substantial changes and 
every day demand a solution to their main needs. That is why 
the government must assume a clear direction so that public 
services be truly beneficial for the user, so that we will have 
such services as electricity, communications, potable water, and 
efficient health and social security services that are reliable, 
sufficient, constant, and inexpensive. 
  Transportation services must be guaranteed in an effective 
manner, so that comfort, timeliness, security, and cost will be 
the permanent rule. Community services, garbage collection, 
streets, highways, sports fields, recreation areas for children 
and adults should be basic priorities of the government's work. 
  A rapid and adequate decentralization of state services that 
is accompanied by a strengthening of municipal tasks will 
contribute to guaranteeing the citizens' participation in 
solving local community problems where the creation of jobs, 
education, security, health, public hygiene, sports activities, 
environmental protection, reforestation, the protection of the 
ecology and renewable resources will also be a task for all. 
<H5>  10. Updating the Future </H5>
  All Panamanians must actively participate in the 
reorganization of state structures and governmental tasks. The 
transformations and changes that all Panamanians are hoping for 
cannot be delayed any longer, and this obligates all of us to 
acquire the commitment of initiating and developing the actions 
of a national nature that, within the economic, social, 
political, and ethical field will become everyday events that 
will allow us to turn the present into a solid base for the 
future we want. 
  The definite eradication of the bad practices and 
corruption that have contributed to the disappointment and 
frustration of the people, is a task that cannot be delayed any 
longer nor does it allow us to remain mere spectators of 
international and national events. The hope for change must be 
transformed into an instrument of action so that we Panamanians 
attain our democratic goals of justice and freedom. 
  We define the state to be an institution of services and the 
government as the entity that renders these services to the 
community. In the commitment that we have acquired to offer 
Panamanians an opportunity to a better life, we will give 
priority to the adequate delivery of the services the state 
offers the people. This is not an issue of availability of 
funds. This is a problem of complying with the functions and 
responsibilities assigned to each entity and government office, 
and within them to each and every one of the public servants. 
  -- If each one does his duty and public services are 
rendered 
in an efficient, reliable, trustworthy, and prompt manner, we 
will begin to alleviate some of the factors that influence 
poverty,... 
  -- If children learn in schools... 
  -- If the sick are taken care of and healed at the 
hospitals,... 
  -- If transportation improves,... 
  -- If electricity, water, and telephone services are cheaper 
and more efficient,... 
  -- If the ports and airports work better,... 
  -- If the entities of culture and sports offer better 
services,... 
  -- If garbage is collected and the streets are cleaned,... 
  -- If public security is effective,... 
  -- If the judges enforce the law,... 
  -- If customs inspectors restrict contraband,... 
  -- If the PTJ units fight drugs,... 
  -- If employees receive adequate protection under the labor 
law and investors are stimulated to take on risks and thus 
create new job opportunities for the youth,... 
  -- If, in summary, the government fulfills its obligation to 
render services, it will be because there is a president who 
makes decisions. 
  This is what I am offering you and what I am planning to be: 
A president who will make decisions for the benefit of the 
people. We must do that in the first 100 days of the government. 
  Once the country has surpassed this initial phase of 
establishing a government that fulfills its functions and makes 
decision, we will have taken firm steps down the paths of 
economic growth and social justice. If a government cannot 
render the basic services that the people need and for which it 
assigns the necessary resources and for which it has the 
necessary infrastructure, then this government cannot even try 
or engage in more complicated tasks. 
  This will be a government that knows how to provide the 
necessary guidance so that all Panamanians will work hard for 
the change we want and for making Panama the fatherland of all, 
a government that will achieve the participation of the 
community, which is not only necessary but vital for success. 
  In view of all the various problems we have mentioned, it is 
clear that Panama can no longer continue as is. The Panamanian 
of today demands a true and urgent change, a profound change in 
the structures of the state, in the distribution of wealth, in 
the role of public services, in the responsibility of the 
politicians, in the allotment of the rights and obligations of 
all citizens. It demands participation. The answer to this 
uproar cannot wait any longer and it has a name: It is 
everyone's plan. 
  Let us begin this path toward progress, doing first the 
simple things, the others will follow immediately. I invite you 
all to join efforts and take off so we will reach the superior 
states of well-being and progress.

  [Text] Social Defense Secretary Mario Soliz Valenzuela has 
said that Colombian "Medellin" and "Cali" drug cartel planes 
make short but important trips into Bolivian territory, taking 
advantage of the speed of their light planes. 
  "The make quick incursions using light planes to collect 
drugs, usually from clandestine airstrips," Soliz said. 
  The secretary told journalists that the police are unable to 
interdict those flights because they are small, random, 
difficult to detect, and do not follow a set timetable. 
  Soliz Valenzuela said the constant violation of Bolivian 
airspace occurs because the borders are long and "difficult to 
control." 
  He said: "The presence of Colombian drug cartels in Bolivia 
is of obvious concern because they encourage cocaine paste 
production." 
  He added, however, that our authorities are doing everything 
necessary to prevent it from getting out of control. 
  Asked about reports on abuses involving DEA agents, Soliz 
said there are no specific reports that can be investigated. 
  "Reports are made in general terms. No one has mentioned 
names or specific cases, otherwise we would have acted 
immediately and punished those responsible," Soliz said. 
  He said the government does not know how many DEA agents 
operate in the country. 
  "I will ask the DEA coordinator in the country for a 
complete 
report to find out how many operate in Bolivia," Soliz concluded.

<F P=106> [By Antonio Ortega] </F>
  [Text] Mexico City, 19 Jan (AFP) -- Luis Donaldo Colosio, 
the leading Mexican presidential candidate, is facing problems 
following the outbreak of guerrilla violence in southern Chiapas 
State. Even Democracy 2000 -- a group within the ruling 
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) -- has withdrawn its 
support for Colosio, because "he is not doing what is best for 
our party." 
  "Democracy 2000 in Veracruz withdraws its support for your 
candidacy and your political campaign because it believes this 
modest current of (PRI) opinion has more clout in civil society 
than organized or authoritarian PRI-ism," it was stated by 
disgruntled members in a letter delivered to Colosio on Tuesday 
during a campaign tour through communities in Veracruz. 
  Colosio, as well as a great many Mexican Government 
authorities, were surprised by the Zapatist National Liberation 
Army (EZLN) rebellion on 1 January 1994 in Chiapas, where the 
candidate had plans to begin his campaign. The state had also 
been considered a bastion of votes for the PRI before the 
rebellion. 
  Mexican analysts have mentioned for several days the 
possibility that the PRI may change its candidate for the 21 
August presidential elections, while the PRI leadership remains 
silent. Only traditional leaders such as Fidel Velasquez, head 
of the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM), have openly 
supported Colosio. 
  "Approximately 70 percent of Democracy 2000's 32 
coordinating 
boards in the country always supported Camacho's appointment as 
presidential candidate. However, in a settlement reached during 
the national convention, we agreed to support whoever was 
designated (Colosio) -- someone who is not doing what is best 
for our party at this time." According to Mexican political 
tradition, the current president -- in this case, Carlos Salinas 
-- designates the PRI candidate and the party merely ratifies 
the appointment. 
  Following Colosio's designation, Camacho resigned from the 
post of Mexico City mayor and accepted the post of foreign 
minister to -- he said -- prevent divisions within the party. 
Upon learning about the magnitude of the social rebellion in 
Chiapas, Salinas appointed Camacho, who is famous as a 
negotiator and has good relations with the opposition, as a 
peace commissioner, and his political status rose, although it 
was considered he had been defeated following the official 
candidate's election. 
  PRI "democrats" indicated, "The political strategy outlined 
by the Change 2000 Foundation for the upcoming elections 
pertains to a Mexico that no longer exists and that was left 
behind on 31 December 1993, when the mythological dream about 
the country's modernization came to an end." 
  Colosio served as social development secretary before being 
nominated the PRI's presidential candidate, and he was in charge 
of resolving the critical problems of extreme poverty which 
afflict approximately 13 million Mexicans, including the Indians 
who comprise the EZLN and who are demanding social justice. 
  Members of Democracy 2000 argue: "The (PRI's) influence 
peddling policy has failed, along with the supporter roundup 
(mandatory trips to attend PRI rallies) methods and false mass 
rallies -- all of which belong to a Mexico that has been left 
behind with its traditional and institutional type of campaign." 
  Certain newspapers have reported that Colosio's rallies were 
a failure, surpassed by current events in Chiapas, and organized 
"in the PRI's own style," with supporter roundups and staged 
scenes that include Indians and poor people from various places 
in the country.

  [Excerpt] Hamilton, Bermuda, 20 Jan, CANA -- Bermuda's 
management and technology minister, Michael Winfield, has 
resigned his recently created cabinet post, citing business and 
family obligations. 
  The move took cabinet ministers by surprise and left Premier 
Sir John Swan not only with a vacant cabinet post, but without a 
government leader in the Senate (upper house), where Senator 
Winfield had steered the government agenda since 1992. 
  But a cabinet shuffle is unlikely, political sources say. 
  Environment Minister Gerald Simons is the logical choice as 
government leader in the Senate, while Senator Grant Gibbons is 
a strong bet to join the cabinet, possibly as minister of 
technology, the sources report. 
  The management portfolio would either be assumed by the new 
minister or handed to an existing minister. 
  An announcement from the premier is expected within days. 
  While giving up his other posts, Senator Winfield 40, will 
keep the seat he has held in the upper house since 1987. 
  Having managed successful United Bermuda Party campaigns in 
1983, 1985 and 1989, he is also expected to remain one of Sir 
John's political advisers. 
  "It's one of the most difficult decisions I have ever made," 
Senator Winfield said of his resignation, which was discussed 
with the premier on Monday and submitted when cabinet met this 
week. [Passage omitted]

  [Text] Quito, 19 Jan (DPA) -- Suddenly, and less than 15 
weeks from scheduled elections to renew nearly the entire 
Ecuadoran Congress, a legislative majority that supports the 
liberal government of President Sixto Duran-Ballen today 
approved comprehensive constitutional reforms that will alter 
the electoral process already under way. 
  The number of deputies was increased from 77 to 113, and the 
requirement of being affiliated to a political party was 
eliminated per the sudden decision by Congress, whose sessions 
had previously been suspended until 1 February by Fernando 
Rosero, acting president of the chamber. However, Samuel 
Belletini, the actual president of Congress, refused to accept 
the suspension, and he reconvened the session. Within a few 
minutes, the controversial package of reforms was approved amid 
loud protests by the opposition. 
  The change in the composition of Congress, which could alter 
the traditional balance between the coastal and mountain 
regions, might entail changing the terms of the upcoming 1 May 
elections, which officially got under way on 1 January under the 
constitutional provisions that were in effect at that time. 
According to the official call for elections, 65 of the 77 
deputies of the unicameral Congress must be elected. 
  President Duran-Ballen must promulgate the reforms in order 
for them to go into effect, and this is practically assured in 
view of the support given to the package by the pro-government 
wing. 
  Violations of procedure, including the approval of rules 
without the necessary votes, have been alleged by the 
opposition, which has announced its decision to ask the 
Constitutional Tribunal to annul the reforms. Meanwhile, the 
full scope of the reforms was not clarified in today's session 
of Congress. While some sectors assured that the reforms will 
not go into effect until 1996 and, in turn, the upcoming 
elections will not be affected, other blocs claimed that the 
changes will go into effect immediately. 
  The same Congress must determine the effective date for the 
reforms to the Constitution that was approved in a 1978 
referendum.

  [Text] A strange attack was staged against a U.S. citizen's 
car in eastern Santiago this morning. The attack occurred 
shortly before 0900 [1200 GMT] on Manuel Canas Street in 
Vitacura, where U.S. citizen (David Soto Barcelo) has his 
residence. 
  Soto had parked his car in front of his house. Two unknown 
persons threw a bomb under the car and escape on foot. Minutes 
later, the bomb went off, damaging the vehicle. 
  Carabineros GOPE [Special Police Operations Group] personnel 
went to the scene and discovered that the bomb was a 
fragmentation grenade. 
  David Soto, who declined to comment on the incident, is 
renting a building in Vitacura. The building is being remodeled 
for housing the LA Rock nightclub. 
  One of the possibilities police are considering is that the 
attack might have something to do with intimidation because of 
Soto's commercial activities.

  [Text] Foreign Affairs Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio said 
yesterday that she did not go to the Caribbean and Central 
American countries to request or to count votes for President 
Cesar Gaviria's nomination for OAS secretary general. She added 
that she simply went there to listen to opinions on his 
candidacy. Minister Sanin pointed out that President Gaviria 
will take the time necessary to make a decision on the issue. 
She abstained from commenting on possible support from the 
nations of the region for his candidacy. 
  "I did not go there to request votes, nor to count them, but 
to make consultations. We enjoy broad support because our 
president is admired, well-liked, and his international 
leadership ability is recognized. Although this is not the 
decisive factor, President Gaviria stays calm," she said. 
  Sanin added that she is totally at peace with herself. She 
said that she is glad that she listened to opinions and is proud 
that she worked to ensure Colombia's chance to reach the OAS 
secretary generalship, which is the most important organization 
in the region. "Any serious country would do the same through 
its foreign ministry," she underscored. She added that she is 
very optimistic about the results of her tour, but President 
Gaviria has the last word. 
  Meanwhile, Panamanian Foreign Relations Minister Jose Raul 
Mulino said yesterday, upon his arrival in Colombia, that his 
country cannot support Gaviria's candidacy for the post of OAS 
secretary general because it already pledged its vote to the 
Costa Rican candidate. Mulino added that his government only has 
words of thanks and admiration for the Colombian president, 
whose foreign policies were praised.

  [Text] Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino made an 
official visit to Colombia on 19 and 20 January 1994, at the 
invitation of Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio. 
  During his visit the foreign minister met with Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo who expressed their 
governments' interest in supporting and strengthening further 
the ties that unite our peoples and governments. 
  The foreign ministers examined the status of their bilateral 
relations and discussed regional and world issues. At the 
conclusion of their talks, they decided to sign the following: 
<H5>  Joint Declaration </H5>
  They reaffirmed their government's full support for UN and 
OAS principles and goals as established in their charters, 
specifically, the respect of human rights, sovereignty, states' 
independence, and the fulfillment in good faith of the 
obligations resulting from treaties and other sources of 
international law. They stressed the consolidation of the 
democratic system and the representative institutions in Latin 
America as a basic principle for developing their people, and 
they agreed to express that elections are the best road for the 
sovereign expression of the people's will. 
  In this regard, the Colombian foreign minister highlighted 
the strengthening of democracy and the progress in the 
Panamanian electoral system. The Panamaian foreign minister 
highlighted the importance that the support offered by the 
National Registry of Colombia has had on this process. 
  They highlighted the importance of the OAS as the qualified 
organization to promote and lead continental integration and as 
a forum to reach a consensus on hemispheric matters in 
political, economic, and social fields. 
  They expressed their support for the initiative of the 
Caribbean Community presidents to create the Association of 
Caribbean States, and they reiterated their willingness to 
participate in that association, which will contribute to the 
economic integration process and to cooperation among the 
nations of the Caribbean Basin. 
  They analyzed the evolution of bilateral relations and 
expressed their commitment to broaden and strengthen them within 
the framework of friendship and cooperation, which historically 
had characterized these relations. In this regard, they 
highlighted the work being done by the Colombian-Panamanian 
Neighboring Commission, and they expressed their conviction that 
it will continue to promote fully the development of relations 
between the two nations. 
  In this regard, the foreign ministers agreed to hold a 
meeting in Panama City during the week of 24 January with 
various commissions on issues such as immigration, boundary 
markers, cooperation in judicial and aeronautic matters, and 
implementation of commitments made during the third 
Colombian-Panamanian Neighboring Commission meeting held in 
Panama on 19 November 1993, so agreements on those issues can be 
signed during the commission's fourth meeting in Medellin. 
  They highlighted the importance of continuing negotiations 
for a speedy implementation of the partial agreements signed in 
Cartagena on 9 July 1993. They agreed to reaffirm that the 
implementation of this document will create new investments and 
job opportunities, thereby contributing to their people's 
well-being. 
  They expressed their governments' interest in promoting 
interministerial meetings between the nations seeking greater 
rapprochement for the solution of common interest issues. In 
this regard, they agreed to call a meeting of the Foreign 
Relations, Defense, Justice, and Government Ministries of both 
nations within 60 days. 
  The foreign minister made a commitment to continue fostering 
the necessary steps for the creation of a binational park that 
will guarantee preservation of the Darien region's natural 
resources, as well as our people's heritage. 
  They agreed to promote a meeting in Panama City during the 
week of 24 January. During this meeting the definite text will 
be prepared for the agreements on normalization of immigration 
under irregular conditions and the treaty on the execution of 
jail sentences. Likewise, they agreed to hold a meeting between 
aeronautics authorities of both nations to identify differences 
and strengthen the agreements signed until now. 
  They agreed on the creation of a subcommission on historical 
heritage within the framework of the Colombian-Panamanian 
Neighboring Commission that initially will take charge of the 
studies on cultural impact on border areas. Likewise, they made 
a commitment, aimed at strengthening the cultural ties between 
both nations, to promote exchanges among their historical 
archives. 
  The Panamanian foreign minister, on behalf of his 
government, 
expressed his gratitude for the Colombian National Police's 
offer to give technical assistance and training to Panama's 
Judicial Technical Police. 
  At the conclusion of his visit, the foreign relations 
minister expressed his gratitude to the Colombian people and 
government for their hospitality and the courtesies offered to 
him and his delegation as well as for the expression of 
friendship he received during his visit. 
  [dated] Santa Fe de Bogota, 19 January 1994.

  [Text] Military units began traveling to Uraba today from 
various areas around the country to reinforce security in 
response to the massacre that took place there. The first unit 
left from Valledupar. 
  On orders from the Army Staff, 240 professional soldiers of 
the 35th Counterguerrilla Battalion traveled to the Uraba region 
this morning. All of the soldiers are young men between 20 and 
25 years of age who are experienced in fighting subversives. 
For a year the troops have covered the mountains of regions 
where the irregulars are most active. For the last six months 
the soldiers have fought between the mountains of the Sierra 
Nevada de Santa Marta and the Perija Hills against FARC 
[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] and ELN [Army of 
National Liberation] guerrillas, who continuously intimidate the 
citizens and cattle ranchers of Cesar Department. 
  [Begin German Guillermo Perico, commander of the 35th 
Counterguerrilla Battalion, recording; identified by caption] 
We will support military operations in the rural area and do 
our part to attain the peace that Colombia needs so much. [end 
recording] 
  The Army's strategy in the Uraba region is to increase the 
presence of the public force to exercise greater control in this 
conflict area. 
  Another counterguerrilla battalion could also be sent to 
that 
banana-producing region over the next few days. 
  This counterguerrilla mobile unit will fight the dissident 
group of the EPL [Popular Liberation Army] and the FARC, who are 
responsible for killings in the rural areas of the Uraba region 
in Antioquia Department.

  [Text] Yesterday in Carepa the acting Defense Minister, 
General Ramon Emilio Gil Bermudez, officially instituted the 
17th Brigade, whose jurisdiction will be Uraba, and turned over 
command of the brigade to Brigadier General Hermofilio Rodriguez. 
  Three thousand soldiers supported by a counterinsurgency 
brigade will try to put a stop to the bloody wave of violence in 
the region. 
  What is to guarantee its future operational success in the 
wake of the fissures in the peace accords among the political 
forces and following the assassination of several dozen 
activists of Hope, Peace and Liberty, and other leftist leaders? 
What does the Armed Forces know aside from what the parties 
involved in the dispute have said? 
  EL TIEMPO has exclusive information about a classified 
intelligence report on the incipient alliance between insurgents 
of the Armed Revolutionary Forces of Colombia (FARC) and Popular 
Liberation Army (EPL) dissidents against those who have 
demobilized. 
  Military officials believe they have reliable evidence that 
FARC guerrillas have forged their first alliance with the 
criminals of the "Bernardo Franco" Front, part of Francisco 
Caraballo's group which is a violent dissident faction of the 
EPL. 
  According to the Armed Forces' information, the insurgents 
of 
the 5th and 34th Fronts have begun to support members of the 
"Bernardo Franco" Front with training, supplies, loans, and arms 
sales. 
  Although they have not carried out any joint actions, it is 
feared that the alliance could increase the number of victims of 
the political control of the zone. 
  The classified report reveals, for example, that in one of 
the largest guerrilla camps in Uraba, located in the El Porroso 
area in Mutata municipality (Antioquia Department), there are 
units of the "Bernardo Franco" Front and close to 250 guerrillas 
of the two FARC fronts. 
  According to military officials, the first step toward an 
"alliance" was the agreement reached in July 1992 between the 
FARC's 5th Front and David Meza Pena, "Gonzalo." 
  Meza obtained the help of the FARC in a kind of guerrilla 
"boarding school" for the EPL's nascent dissident group. 
  According to the report, there are 710 armed guerrillas in 
Uraba. 
  The militias, for their part, have grown substantially in 
the 
last year. According to the report, close to 800 men belong to 
the FARC's Bolivarian Milita, which operates in Apartado, 
Chigorodo, Mutata, and Carepa Municipalities. 
  The two FARC Fronts and the incipient "Bernando Franco" 
Front 
are trying to divide into at least five or six fronts. 
  Those fronts have the mission of opening political space 
and, 
according to military officials, obtaining control of the 
region's largest union: Sintrainagro [Banana Worker's Union]. 
  This is what has led to the systematic assassination of 
members of Hope, Peace and Liberty. 
  The following groups currently operate in the region. 
<H5>  The 5th Front </H5>
  The history of the struggle for political control is not 
new. 
In fact, beginning in April 1971, the FARC secretariat decided 
to bring to Uraba a group of insurgents who later became the 5th 
Front. 
  Now 22 years later, that front is a kind of "parent" front 
in 
the region and has 350 combatants. Its area of influence 
comprises Murindo, Apartado, Chigorodo, Carepa, Turbo, Necocli, 
and San Pedro de Uraba Municipalities. 
  Up until April 1993 the front was under the command of 
Efrain 
Guzman, "El Chucho," who was transferred, following the 8th 
conference of the FARC, to the FARC secretariat, where he is now 
in charge of coordinating the bloc of the FARC's northeastern 
front. 
  The 5th Front is under the command of Noel Mata Mata. 
According to the classified report, it consists of a general 
staff, a company charged with security for the general staff, 
and four combat companies. The main camp is in Porroso (Mutata). 
According to intelligence information, the guerrillas of that 
front have been setting up camps and schools in Los Tocales, 
Rosali Arriba, Puerto Galleta, El Porroso, and Tamarindo. 
<H5>  The 34th Front </H5>
  This front operates with 200 men organized into three 
"companies": Cacique Nutibara, Cacique Tone, and the Chanburay 
Indian Group. Each one has several companies operating in the 
region. 
  Since 1987, in view of the excessive growth of the 5th 
Front, 
the FARC secretariat decided to organize the 34th Front. But it 
was not until mid-1991 that the presence of this criminal group 
was felt in the region. 
  Security organizations know with certainty that this front 
is 
less belligerent than the 5th. However, it was the insurgents of 
the 34th who attacked a military patrol several months ago in 
Mutata and killed three soldiers of the Army. 
  Intelligent reports say that the 34th Front was exclusively 
in charge of the trafficking of arms and contraband along the 
border, as well as extorting tourist businesses in the Capurgana 
region. 
  At the same time, they add, one of the 34th Front's 
principal 
sources of financing is drug trafficking. According to Armed 
Forces' reports the front maintains 1,200 hectares of coca 
plantations. The crops in the Acandi and Zapzurro zones belong 
to the guerrillas. 
  According to military officials, the desire for the money 
generated by these crops has been a decisive factor in the 
growth of the front. 
  The commander of this front, also known as Comision Alberto 
Martinez, is Luis Uzuga Restrepo, "Isaias Trujillo," or Jose 
Salvador Galan Rodriguez. Trujillo maintains control over the 
Acandi, Unguia, Riosucio, Rioneca, 
and Balboa Municipalities, as well as the entire border with 
Panama. 
  The guerrillas' presence in Dabeiba, Frontino, and Uramita 
Municipalities leads intelligence organizations to believe that 
the FARC is trying to split the 34th Front and that a new one, 
called "Mariscal Sucre," has already begun to form. 
  This front, according to the report, would have the same 
basic mission of distracting the authorities' attention in order 
to continue with its drug-trafficking activities in Acandi and 
Zapzurro municipalities. 
<H5>  EPL Dissidents </H5>
  They were a group of 25 men. They had two missions: to 
revitalize the EPL and to eliminate their former comrades who 
decided to lay down their arms at the beginning of 1991. Now 
there are 160 guerrillas. They do not call themselves the EPL, 
but the "Bernardo Franco" Front. And according to President 
Cesar Gaviria himself, they are responsible for the majority of 
assassinations of members of Hope, Peace, and Liberty. 
  This front has five combat commissions, a "support 
commission," and local guerrillas (similar to the the FARC 
Bolivarian Militias) in the municipalities under its influence. 
  The commanders of the commissions are David Mesa Pena, 
"Gonzalo"; Efren Vargas Gutierrez, "Gavilan"; Juan Alvarez 
Pastrana, "Rodrigo," and Orlando 
Vergara. 
  But the group's recruitment efforts continue. According to 
the report, its members are trying to form various "guerrilla 
fronts" each comprising five commissions. 
  Since the beginning, it has carried out its criminal 
activities in El Tres, El Dos, Turbo, San Vincente del Congo, 
Pueblo Bello, San Jose de Bulatos, and Pueblo Nuevo. 
  The front's influence extends to Arboletes, Necocli, 
Apartado, Chigorodo, and Carepa municipalities. 
  The military officials attribute the strengthening of the 
"Bernardo Franco" Front to its capacity for recruiting into its 
guerrilla ranks inhabitants of the region who have families 
there and who have a very good knowledge of the terrain in which 
they operate. 
  According to the officials, the families' houses serve as 
hiding places for arms and guerrillas. In addition, they obtain 
information about the movements of the security forces and its 
enemies, the members of Hope, Peace, and Liberty.

  [Text] If the presidential elections were held today, 
Andres Pastrana would win with a lead of over seven points ahead 
of Ernesto Samper Pizano, according to a poll by Yankelovich 
Colombia for the Pastrana campaign. The poll was released 
yesterday. 
  However, an EL TIEMPO poll arranged with the same polling 
firm, which then subcontracted the poll to the CNC [National 
Survey Center], gives different data on who the next president 
might be. These figures and the explanations of each of the 
firms--Yankelovich and the CNC--will be published by EL TIEMPO 
on Sunday. Yankelovich is now working as a polling consultant to 
the Andres Pastrana campaign, and for that reason subcontracted 
EL TIEMPO's poll to the CNC. 
  According to the poll the Pastrana campaign released 
yesterday, the total number of persons polled would vote as 
follows: 
  In the first presidential round: for Andres Pastrana, 30.5 
percent; for Ernesto Samper, 23.8 percent; and for Antonio 
Navarro, who would be third, 8.9 percent. 
  In the second round, Pastrana would also emerge as the 
winner, with a lead of almost eight points ahead of Samper. 
Pastrana would win 41.0 percent of the votes, with Samper 
getting 32.1 percent. 
  Over half of those polled, 56 percent, said they intend to 
vote. These respondents said they would vote for president as 
follows: in the first round, 36.6 percent for Andres Pastrana, 
and 29.4 percent for Samper. Antonio Navarro Wolf would be 
third, with 7.8 percent. 
  In the second round, those who said they are going to vote 
would vote as follows: for Andres Pastrana, 38.7 percent; for 
Ernesto Samper, 30.6 percent; and for Miguel Maza Marquez, 2.2 
percent. 
  To the question, "Who do you think is going to be the next 
president of Colombia, independently of whom you are going to 
vote for?" the 1,212 persons questioned answered: 38.7 percent 
said Andres Pastrana, 30.6 percent said Samper, and 2.2 percent 
chose Miguel Maza Marquez. 
  On primary elections to select the Conservative and Liberal 
Parties' candidates, the poll revealed the following: 
  In the Liberal Party, Ernesto Samper would win twice the 
number of votes as Humberto de la Calle, who would be second, 
followed by Carlos Lemos. 
  In the Conservative Party, Andres Pastrana would win 51 
percent of the votes, with Roberto Gerlein getting 4 percent. 
Juan Diego Jaramillo would be third in a Conservative primary, 
with 3.1 percent. 
<H5>  How the Poll Was Conducted </H5>
  The poll was conducted by Yankelovich for Andres Pastrana's 
campaign among 1,212 people from the lower, middle, and upper 
socioeconomic sectors in Bogota, Medellin, Cali, Barranquilla, 
Bucaramanga, Cartagena, and Santa Marta. 
  The surveys were conducted by telephone on 10, 11, and 12 
December using a random digital method. 
  The results have a margin of error of 2.8 percent for the 
total population and 3.5 percent for those who say they intend 
to vote.

  [Text] The race for the presidency of Colombia between two 
candidates, Ernesto Samper and Andres Pastrana, is fairly close, 
according to EL TIEMPO's latest poll, conducted by the CNC 
[National Survey Center]. 
  Samper would win the first and second rounds, based on 
responses of people who intend to vote. But of the total 
respondents surveyed, Pastrana would win the first round, with a 
tie in the second round. 
  In comparing these results with the EL TIEMPO poll conducted 
by Yankelovich in September 1993, the same trend is evident. 
Three months ago Pastrana was winning the first round among the 
total number polled by 1.2 points, while in the second round the 
two candidates would each win 38.3 percent of the votes. 
  In the same way, among people who said they intend to vote, 
which at that time was 57 percent of the total number polled, 
Samper led Pastrana by 0.7 percent. 
  Now, of the total number polled, 39 percent think Pastrana 
is 
going to be the next president, followed by Samper with 38 
percent. 
  Those who said they are going to vote think Colombia's next 
president is going to be Ernesto Samper, by a three-point 
difference. 
  These results show that the race between Samper and Pastrana 
is a real neck-to-neck contest, as the poll has a three-percent 
margin of error for the total population. 
  The poll results show without a doubt that Andres Pastrana 
and Ernesto Samper would be chosen as their parties' 
presidential candidates, both in the Liberal primary and in a 
Conservative primary, if the Conservatives decided to hold one. 
<H5>  Voters and Nonvoters </H5>
  Of the total population, over half the people polled said 
they intend to vote in the next elections; 64 percent are now 
registered. 
  Of this group who intend to vote in the next presidential 
election, 89 percent always intended to vote for the same 
candidate, while 9 percent had thought of voting for someone 
else. 
  In the total population, 19 percent are still undecided 
about 
whether or not they will vote. 
<H5>  Age and Sex </H5>
  In breaking down the population by sex, age, and 
socioeconomic level, the results among the total number polled 
show that Pastrana would get more votes from women than men, 
while Samper would receive more votes from men than from women. 
  In terms of age, the majority of Pastrana's votes would come 
from people between 18 and 39, while the majority of Samper's 
votes would come from people over 25. 
  In terms of socioeconomic level, classified for the purposes 
of this poll as lower, middle, and upper, both candidates would 
get most of their votes from the middle class, followed by the 
upper class. A difference was found among voters from the lower 
socioeconomic group, where more people intend to vote for Samper. 
<H5>  How the Total of Poll Respondents Would Vote </H5>

you vote?

<H5>  The Government </H5>
  On President Cesar Gaviria's image and performance, the poll 
shows that while a third of the people have a good image of the 
chief executive, over half approve of his job performance. 
  When compared with the May and September polls, these 
figures 
show that the president's ratings have improved in both aspects. 
  In May, 34.5 percent approved of his performance; in 
September, 47.1 percent, and in December, his approval rating 
was 53 percent. 
  The president's positive image rose from 15.1 percent in May 
to 31.2 percent in September, and to 33 percent in December. 
  In the latest poll, 14 percent have a poor image of the 
president, and 38 percent disapprove of his performance. 
  On the nation's situation, 59 percent describe it as 
average, 
33 percent as bad, and 8 percent as good.

<H5>  How the Poll Was Conducted </H5>
  EL TIEMPO hired Yankelovich of Colombia, but since it is now 
working for the Andres Pastrana campaign, it subcontracted the 
poll, with EL TIEMPO's permission, to the National Survey Center. 
  The telephone poll was conducted among 1,298 persons in 
Bogota, Medellin, Cali, Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Cartagena, 
and Santa Marta, from middle, lower, and upper socioeconomic 
levels. 
  In all, 589 men and 700 women between 18 and 65 were 
surveyed. 
  The poll's margin of error is 3 percent.

<F P=106> [Report by Manola Robles] </F>
  [Excerpt] Speaking at the end of a meeting that a group of 
Mexican legislators held with President Patricio Aylwin, Mexican 
Senator Carlos Seles Gutierrez said the Mexican Senate and 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari support the admission of 
Chile into a free trade agreement with the United States. 
  Speaking about the possibility of a free trade agreement 
with 
the United States, Seles said: 
  [Begin Seles recording, in progress] ...whether through 
NAFTA 
or a bilateral agreement. This depends on Chilean national 
interests. Overall we held a cordial meeting, during which we 
discussed the progress that our bilateral ties have experienced. 
[end recording] 
  Commenting on persistent oppostion to NAFTA in Mexico, Seles 
said that any U.S.-Chilean free trade agreement would be based 
on very different terms than those of the U.S.-Mexican 
agreement, because 70 percent of Mexican trade is targeted at 
the United States. 
  [Begin Seles Recording] I do not believe we will experience 
the great impact that people are talking about, because if labor 
costs were the determinant factor for companies establishing 
themselves, then they would be establishing themselves in Haiti 
or in countries that pay lower salaries than ours. 
  I believe the NAFTA agreement will inevitably lead to new 
investments in Mexico. However, we Mexicans believe we will be 
luring greater investment from countries oustide NAFTA, that is, 
outside the United States and Canada. We believe we will be 
luring greater investment from Asian and Pacific Rim countries, 
mainly from Japan, and from Europe, which together with Mexicans 
will be able to exploit Mexican resources to reach the huge 
American market. [end recording] [passage omitted]

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] The wealthiest 10 percent of Chilean households 
accounted for 47.5 percent of the total income generated by the 
country in the late 1980's, although the distribution of income 
was somewhat less inequitable at the start of the 1990's. We can 
gather this from a study by the Economic Commission for Latin 
America and the Caribbean, ECLA. 
  In contrast, the study, which was made public this past 
weekend, notes that the poorest decile (10 percent) of the 
country's households received just 1.5 percent of total income; 
this figure remained practically the same as the 1990's began. 
  The rest of the income pie is divided up among the other 
eight deciles. From top to bottom, the ninth has 14.8 percent; 
the eighth 10 percent; the seventh 7.7 percent; the sixth 6 
percent; the fifth 5 percent; the fourth 4 percent; the third 
3.4 percent, and the second 2.3 percent. 
  The numbers in Greater Santiago are very similar to the 
nationwide totals. According to the ECLA data, the wealthiest 
decile of households account for 43.1 percent of the total, 
while the poorest decile commands 1.8 percent. 
  There is greater inequity, however, in rural areas. Here, 
the 
wealthiest decile of households accounts for almost 60 percent 
(59.8 percent) of total income, while the poorest decile 
accounts for just 1.1 percent. 
  There is hardly a surplus of studies on income distribution 
in Latin America. They became particularly scarce in the early 
1980's when the circumstances of the poorest groups grew 
markedly worse, after which the recovery benefited the richest 
segments of the population first. 
  This trend was especially marked in Chile, where the 
military 
government and its technocrats chose a macroeconomic policy of 
belt-tightening rather than seeking to distribute more equitably 
the wealth generated by the country. 
  Very few studies were conducted on the issue. 
  Afterwards, under the current administration the Planning 
Ministry (Mideplan) undertook several studies in this regard, 
also covering the issue of poverty and indigence levels. They 
showed that although the trend towards income concentration that 
Chile saw in the 1980's is being reversed, there have not been 
major improvements in the early 1990's. 
  In spite of the serious efforts undertaken, which can be 
evaluated only after the current administration's term is over, 
Chile is still one of the Latin American countries with the 
worst income distribution according to World Bank figures. 
  For example, the numbers in the ECLA study show that 
although 
Mexico underwent a macroeconomic belt-tightening just as severe 
as Chile's or even more so, its income distribution is better 
than ours at present. 
  In Mexico, the wealthiest 10 percent of households accounted 
for 33.4 percent of total income in 1990, that is to say, about 
a third, compared to more than 45 percent in Chile. The status 
of the poorest households is only slightly better in Mexico than 
in Chile, however; they receive 2 percent of national income, 
compared to 1.5 percent in Chile. 
  UN data from 1992 show that the situation in Chile is 
comparable to that in Brazil and Peru, two of the countries in 
the region that are doing the worst in this regard, and is worse 
than in Argentina and Venezuela at present. 
  For comparison purposes we might note that in the G-7 
countries (the seven most developed countries in the world) the 
richest 20 percent of the population accounts for just 38.7 
percent of total income and the poorest 20 percent 6.8 percent. 
  If we use the same yardsticks in Chile, the numbers are 60.1 
and 3.8 percent in 1990 (this does not take into account the 
subsequent mild improvement). 
  Another yardstick shows that the income of the wealthiest 20 
percent was 12.45 times greater than the income of the poorest 
20 percent in Chile in 1987, 13.19 times greater in 1990, and 
back down to 12.31 times greater in 1992, a positive trend.

<F P=106> [Interview with Socialist Party President Ricardo Lagos by </F>
Monica Gonzalez in Santiago, date not given; first paragraph is 
LA NACION introduction] 
  [Text] Thin, cat-like Ricardo Lagos radiates happiness. And 
not because of the election results. One could say that from the 
ideas brewing in his head and the movements of his hands, he has 
been concocting something new over the past few months and has 
finally found the occasion to put it in the oven. Alongside his 
wife, Luisa Duran, he laughs heartily in his new home, a 
beautiful apartment in Providencia. The evidence is clear that 
now is a fine time for him to take on new challenges that are 
not confrontational. Lagos's new undertaking will create 
problems for him with the officers of the PPD [Party for 
Democracy] and with other well-known figures from his sector; 
there can be no doubt that he is a difficult person. Nor can 
there be any doubt that we will soon find out whether he will be 
in the new cabinet. 
  [Gonzalez] The results of an election prompt individual 
politicians to assess how they have been affected. Do you think 
that the absence of your name from the ballot was a good thing? 
  [Lagos] The country wanted an election like this one, in 
which the lines were drawn very clearly in advance, inasmuch as 
people realized that the Coalition was the only real choice to 
form a government. And this is what happened. 
  [Gonzalez] Was it the election that the country deserved? 
  [Lagos] No! Chile has gone through epic, exhausting events 
and wanted to have a calm election like this one. 
  [Gonzalez] Deep down, would you have liked to see your name 
on the ballot? 
  [Lagos] Whether someone appears on the ballot depends on 
circumstances, and I do not think that circumstances were right 
for me to be on it. 
  [Gonzalez] What would have happened if there had not been 
primaries? 
  [Lagos] My name would have been on the ballot! That is the 
way it would have been, as I always said. The primary election, 
above and beyond its results, lent dignity to public life, which 
consists not of negotiation but rather ideas and principles. 
Everybody was asking what Lagos was demanding to withdraw. I did 
not ask for anything! I am proud of that! The primaries were a 
major source of dignity for our world. 
  It was an intelligent way of dealing with a dilemma and, in 
passing, lent tremendous legitimacy to Eduardo Frei in our world. 
  [Gonzalez] We also saw that the PS [Socialist Party]-PPD 
world is afraid of confrontation. 
  [Lagos] Well...Life has been tough (He laughs 
mischievously). 
  [Gonzalez] Aren't you afraid of it? 
  [Lagos] No. What is more, confrontation is part of the 
democratic system. The results of the senatorial elections, 
which appear elsewhere in this paper, are tremendously 
encouraging. Just look at how the senatorial candidates of the 
PDC [Christian Democrat Party] and the PR [Radical Party] did 
and how the PS-PPD did. They were quite even, which enables us 
to look to the future with optimism. Competition is not bad for 
us. 
  [Gonzalez] Isn't there a fear of losing positions, ground, 
power? 
  [Lagos] That would be very petty thinking, and I would 
rather 
think about other things...But it takes all kinds. I do think 
that a lot of people became set in their ways. There were 
friends of the congressional world who thought that if there 
were two candidates or a confrontation, they would lose their 
seat. And just look at where we stand. I have once again 
traveled around Chile supporting our candidates because they are 
all running against the DC [Christian Democracy] or someone 
backed by the DC. When all is said and done, there is 
competition. I have always said: the party that has the 
presidential candidate has a very big advantage. 
  [Gonzalez] Has it been hard for you to play the supporting 
role on stage? 
  [Lagos] Actually...no! I have accompanied Frei and when I do 
so, I am number two, in the background, because that is my 
place. The truth is that I have not found it hard! 
  [Gonzalez] How are your relations with the PPD? 
  [Lagos] I have good relations with my friends in the rank 
and 
file, in the regions, and we have had a different way of 
approaching certain problems with their leaders. You are talking 
about a party that has come of age and that does what it feels 
it ought to do. 
  [Gonzalez] Is your heart divided between the PS and the PPD? 
  [Lagos] No, my heart lies firmly with a single agenda, and 
this is what has to be pursued, and in earnest. We have walked a 
long road, and the time has come, not tomorrow or the day after. 
These are not immediate issues.... 
  [Gonzalez] But just a few months ago you thought that a 
merger of the PS and PPD was imminent. 
  [Lagos] Yes. 
  [Gonzalez] What stopped it? 
  [Lagos] Many still think that they can manage the little 
spheres that they have. The real world will teach them that when 
you have a battleship traveling at 30 knots and, alongside it, 
two small motorboats each going 10 knots, the motorboats cannot 
measure up to the battleship. You have to try something new and 
different. And I think that what happened in this election 
proves me right. 
  [Gonzalez] Is Ricardo Lagos advocating a new movement? 
  [Lagos] Yes. 
  [Gonzalez] And what will you do if you do not become a 
minister this time? 
  [Lagos] I do not think that being a minister is all there is 
to life. My project today is to put together a group for 
reflection and thought and to try and marshal the 1,800 or 2,000 
professionals who took an active part in our program. 
  [Gonzalez] Are you talking about a movement that is 
independent of the parties? 
  [Lagos] No, with the parties. All of these professionals 
belong to the parties, aside from the ones who are independents. 
But I think that it is important to have a place for reflection 
and thought, for coming together, but not a research center. The 
idea, rather, is to make sure that this major effort can sustain 
and develop itself so that it does not go to waste. When we did 
"Chile 21," I told them that this did not end with the 
elections. This is why we have undertaken this project. 
  [Gonzalez] Max Neef has said that they will start today to 
build a movement that aims to become a swarm of mosquitoes. 
Isn't this the same thing that you are proposing? 
  [Lagos] Ha, ha, ha. No, these are professionals, not 
mosquitoes. I think that it is important to have a place where 
people can express their views no matter what party they belong 
to. 
  [Gonzalez] I will say it again. The movement that you are 
calling for sounds like something new outside the parties that 
exist today. 
  [Lagos] No, it is not outside the parties. Is the Freedom 
and 
Development Institute outside the parties or is it a channel 
through which the right expresses itself? 
  [Gonzalez] So what you want is to start the unification 
process from the side, not head on. 
  [Lagos] (Laughs) No! But if that helps, fine. But this is 
not 
my aim, because we do not want to wind up with anything 
organizational. 
  [Gonzalez] Honestly, aren't you interested in joining the 
administration? 
  [Lagos] One joins an administration when one is invited, and 
the person who does the inviting is the president, not the 
candidates. Consequently, I was not able to receive an 
invitation. 
  [Gonzalez] And what if you receive one tomorrow? 
  [Lagos] I would feel very honored, and at that point I would 
have to see what things look like, what the overall team looks 
like, what other people are in there. I try to think about how 
it was when I joined President Aylwin's cabinet. We talked about 
what the cabinet was going to be like, its makeup, and at one 
point he asked me to be justice minister. I told him that I did 
not think so, that if things went too well for me, he might not 
remain president (laughs loudly again). And if I failed...He 
hinted at another ministry. I asked him whether what he wanted 
was to have me in the cabinet. He said yes, that the country 
would not understand it if I were not a part of his 
administration and that he would have to explain that I was not 
in there because I did not accept the post he offered me. In 
that case, Mr. President, I said, I am going to work with you. 
President Aylwin was very kind to me. 
  [Gonzalez] What you wanted was to choose a ministry, wasn't 
it? 
  [Lagos] I told him Education. 
  [Gonzalez] Are you going to be the new interior minister in 
the Frei administration? 
  [Lagos] I do not know. I cannot answer that. I might accept 
any ministry. Any one is a great honor, depending on the 
conditions in which it operates. 
  [Lagos] Do you agree with Genaro Arriagada that the next 
administration will lay a new groundwork? 
  [Lagos] If we are able to rebuild certain foundations for 
greater democracy, it would be very significant. I do think that 
we have to propose this at the outset, not at the end. The best 
proof has been the shortening of the presidential term. The 
conditions are in place for this to happen once the appointed 
senators disappear and more important reforms can be proposed. 
At the outset I would bring up the issue of reforming the 
electoral system. There are other, more complex and difficult 
issues, but at the outset at least I would focus on the 
electoral system. Otherwise we run the risk of holding a broad 
theoretical debate on the things that we ought to do. 
  [Gonzalez] What differences do you perceive between the 
alliance that will presumably govern as of March and the 
outgoing one? 
  [Lagos] First of all, the agenda is different. President 
Aylwin's agenda has been typical of a transition: 
civilian-military relations, human rights violations, containing 
potential social outbursts, restoring freedom in culture, 
education, and the intelligentsia. And lastly, incorporating 
Chile into the world. 
  Today, in contrast, as a result of Aylwin's partially 
successful agenda (because we have not settled the human rights 
issue or taken care of civilian-military relations, but we have 
made headway), these issues are much lower on the agenda. And 
there is a very strong perception that although the country has 
had growth, it has not benefited everyone alike. This is why the 
number one item on the agenda is how do we see to it that 
progress benefits everyone. 
  [Gonzalez] Not the gains of the political transition? 
  [Lagos] No, there is still much to be done in connection 
with 
human rights, but the next administration is going to be judged 
by what it does in connection with the first item on the agenda. 
The speeches that we all heard cannot be repeated, like the one 
in which Aylwin asked for forgiveness on Chile's behalf for what 
happened in the area of human rights. The challenges are 
different. 
  [Gonzalez] Was the cabinet's last stage as successful as the 
first? 
  [Lagos] That is an unfair question because it creates the 
impression that someone was very important in the cabinet, which 
is not true. But the final stage is different from the first. 
The president tried to address two or three issues, and I 
honestly think that he addressed them poorly. I thought that it 
would be difficult, if not impossible, to pass a law to resolve 
the problem of the missing detainees with the backing of the 
right. How is the right going to back anything that would 
satisfy us! Overall, though, the administration is leaving 
office with a spectacular approval rating that any other would 
be hard put to achieve. 
  [Gonzalez] How are your relations with President Aylwin? 
  [Lagos] Very good and with his wife Leonor too. Her 
understanding of her position has been exceptional. 
  [Gonzalez] How are your relations with Eduardo Frei? 
  [Lagos] They are good. I think that before the primary 
elections we had good relations and when they were over, they 
were even better. This is amusing because we ran against each 
other in the primaries but became closer friends. Ours is a 
relationship in which we speak frankly. 
  [Gonzalez] Do you have confidence in him as Chile's next 
president? 
  [Lagos] Yes. He joined public life out of a major ethical 
commitment. I have never talked with him about why he left 
private life and got involved in this. I think that he felt he 
had a job to do. When you see him giving speeches and traveling 
around, particularly in small towns, with few people, you see 
that he feels deeply motivated by what can be done. As a result, 
he has acquitted himself well. At this point no one thinks that 
he is just a name. 
  [Gonzalez] Did you think that at one time? 
  [Lagos] Honestly, when you looked at him at the beginning, 
you thought that it would be very unlikely that he would get 
where he has gotten. He had problems communicating and has made 
great progress. Being president obviously does not require a 
gift for communication, but he developed one, besides the other 
qualities that are required and that he possesses. He has clear 
ideas on basic directions and delegates a great deal. 
  [Gonzalez] It was easy for the ministers, you included, to 
show obedience to Aylwin. Will it also be easy with Frei? 
  [Lagos] I think so. He has a leadership that he will have to 
maintain from day to day. Leaderships are not permanent. 
  [Gonzalez] You are well aware of that, aren't you? 
  [Lagos] Yes (laughing). It is one thing to be president and 
another to remain in the ascendancy. Aylwin was able to assert 
his leadership in the sense that if you had a disagreement with 
a minister, and I did, you went to talk with the president, and 
whether he agreed or disagreed with you, you knew for certain 
that his decision had nothing to do with whether the other 
minister was from the DC or not. The thought never occurred to 
me. He was the president, period. 
  [Gonzalez] Do you have doubts that it will be the same under 
Frei? 
  [Lagos] The two or three times that I have asked Frei to do 
something, he has done so with total independence. That is the 
basis for leadership. 
  [Gonzalez] Will the parties play a different role under the 
next administration? 
  [Lagos] That has been said often, but I find it hard to 
understand how it will happen. It arises from a real situation; 
it is a desire that I think President Frei shares. What I am not 
clear about is how it will come to pass. And I realize that it 
is different, because Aylwin's cabinet was a continuation of the 
Coalition. In contrast, a different relationship is going to 
develop as the parties conduct their talks through channels 
other than the ministers. We have to establish a relationship 
between the parties and the president that does not entail a 
joint government, of course. 
  [Gonzalez] What would you say has been the Aylwin 
administration's weak point? 
  [Lagos] The fact that the constitutional reforms should have 
been proposed at its outset, not its end. 
  [Gonzalez] And its strong point? 
  [Lagos] The reconciliation that it achieved and the 
leadership that it developed vis-a-vis all Chileans. 
  [Gonzalez] What has happened with Pinochet after a four-year 
transition? 
  [Gonzalez] This is Aylwin's strong point. Everyone is 
asking: 
"Where is Pinochet?" Foreigners find it hard to believe that he 
is no longer a factor in spite of his expressions of displeasure 
with the government. Pinochet can dress himself up in warrior's 
garb and send his soldiers out on the streets (he has yet to 
send out his tanks); he can do all that and more, but the only 
thing that he cannot do is stage a coup d'etat. The world is 
different. Circumstances are completely different, although 
legally speaking things have not changed. 
  [Gonzalez] Is that why his arbitrary power lost its effect 
when people stopped being afraid? 
  [Lagos] People are still a bit afraid. Many thought, for 
example, that Lagos may be fine but he could cause something 
like that...If you let yourself dream but see the risk of 
interrupting the present calm, then you conclude that it would 
be better to postpone your dreams. This is still the case in 
Chile. But the country senses that a job remains to be done. 
  [Gonzalez] Today we can see the PPD moving more towards the 
center to vie for voters with the PDC. Does this strategy put 
you off? 
  [Lagos] No. I have always thought that our role is to become 
a party that commands a majority in the country, and this means 
covering a broad spectrum. The thing is, though, that you do not 
control the center or the left just by taking positions more 
towards the center or left. You control them with visions of 
what you want the country to be. And you do not do this in 
day-to-day work; you do not do this on small things: if the 
other person disagrees, then I abstain and move more to the 
center. No! 
  [Gonzalez] Is this why you are proposing a new movement of 
professionals? 
  [Lagos] Because I think that certain visions of Chile are 
lacking. I was invited to a gathering in honor of Anibal Pinto 
on the 35th anniversary of his book Chile: un caso de 
desarrollo frustrado [Chile: A Case of Thwarted 
Development]. Chile was thwarted because late last century 
no one thought about the medium term. People thought that the 
sodium nitrate boom was going to last forever. Vargas Llosa's 
question "At what point did Peru mess up?" has great 
significance for us. A party captures the imagination of most of 
society, not the center, when it expresses a clear-cut agenda. 
This is what remains to be done. 
  [Gonzalez] Didn't Manfred Max-Neef occupy the space that 
Lagos left when he withdrew from the race? 
  [Lagos] No, I would have gotten more votes than Max-Neef 
(guffaws again). Let's be serious! Max-Neef has sought to 
express a different way of interpreting public life and to bring 
up certain issues that he said were missing. 
  [Gonzalez] And what would you call them? 
  [Lagos] I was very mindful of them, and they exist, but my 
way of addressing them is different. The votes that Max-Neef got 
are a factor that the PS and the PPD have to analyze in earnest, 
because they always thought that the MIDA [Allendist Leftist 
Democratic Movement] was the big problem. And that is not the 
case. 
  [Gonzalez] You have said that the MIDA is obsolete. 
  [Lagos] Of course, because I do not see the problem there. I 
have always said: Watch out! Every society requires a force that 
embodies change. And if we are not the ones, it will be someone 
else. And the votes that Max-Neef got came from the people who 
thought that the Coalition or we, as part of it, were incapable 
of bringing about enough change. I spoke with a lot of people 
who voted for Max-Neef and for the PS and PPD in the 
congressional elections, and that explanation sounded right to 
them. It shows that we have not been explicit enough in saying 
what we want to do. 
  [Gonzalez] And so? 
  [Lagos] We have to find a way of understanding and drawing 
near this very obvious group. When I say that there is a great 
chance of creating a movement, a party, in short, something new, 
it is because we have to be capable of making this effort.

<F P=106> [Article by Julio Ottoboni, from Sao Jose dos Campos] </F>
  [Text] After more than eight years of its being dormant the 
Aeronautics Ministry has reactivated the controversial Piranha 
teleguided missile project, which had been suspended twice. 
  The new contract was signed with Mectron Engenharia, a 
company headquartered in Sao Jose dos Campos, which is basically 
comprised of engineers trained at the Aeronautical Technology 
Institute (ITA). The Aeronautics Ministry has cloaked this 
project in secrecy. Despite this military sources told O ESTADO 
DE SAO PAULO that the ministry intends to develop several 
prototypes without delay, so that they can compete on the 
international market within 30 months. 
  The federal government has acquiesced in appropriating $10 
million for the project, as stipulated in the contract. Mectron 
Engenharia, which will be in charge of the development and tests 
of the prototype for the missiles, will work in cooperation with 
the Aerospace Technical Center (CTA). 
  The Piranha (MAA-1) air-to-air missile will probably be 
assembled at Engesa [Specialized Engineers, Inc.], which has 
recently filed for bankruptcy. Engesa had enlarged its 
facilities to mass produce the Piranha missile during the 
eighties, and kept the necessary equipment. According to 
reports, 80 percent of the missile has already been manufactured. 
  The Aeronautics Ministry intends to launch the Piranha 
missile on the international weapons market as a sophisticated 
and reasonably priced product compared to its competitors. 
While the prices of foreign models range between $120,000 and 
$250,000, the domestic missile will be sold at $100,000. 
  Argentina's Condor missile, technologically inferior to the 
Piranha, is vying with the latter for that sales market. 
According to the same sources, the urgency in the reactivation 
of the missile project is due to the growing need for efficient 
weapons in air surveillance demanded by the Amazon Protection 
System (Sipam). The Armed Forces' supersonic fighter aircraft, 
Xavante and AMX, manufactured by Embraer [Brazilian Aeronautics 
Company], will be fitted with two Piranha air-to-air missiles on 
the wing tips. Furthermore, the Navy and the Army will have at 
their disposal versions of Piranha air-to-surface and 
surface-to-air missiles.

  [Excerpts] Chamber of Deputies President Inocencio de 
Oliveira today ordered the creation of a control committee to 
continue the work of the Budget CPI [Congressional Investigating 
Committee] and scrutinize those congressmen the CPI report 
recommends be further investigated. This control committee will 
have 30 days to conclude its work, and will be made up of seven 
congressmen. It will be coordinated by the Chamber of Deputies 
vice president, Deputy Fernando Lira, and the rapporteur will be 
Deputy Vital do Rego, comptroller of the lower house. 
  Meanwhile, the final Budget CPI report must be corrected 
before it is delivered to the presidents of the Senate and the 
Chamber of Deputies. [passage omitted] 
  Budget CPI President Senator Jarbas Passarinho spent the 
morning in his house organizing the documents that arrived at 
the last moment at the CPI, and which must be added to the final 
report. One of the documents which arrived during the weekend 
is a report from Sergipe Governor Joao Alves demonstrating that 
his assets are compatible with his income. The document was 
processed by rapporteur Deputy Roberto Magalhaes. 
  Senator Passarinho must hand in the final CPI report to the 
Chamber of Deputies president this afternoon. But this will 
only take place if the Senate data processing service manages to 
print the report with the corrections made by the CPI members 
and the improvised commentaries made by the rapporteur as he 
read the final report. 
  Furthermore, Chamber of Deputies President Inocencio de 
Oliveira said that the Constitution and Justice Committee, which 
must judge the congressmen mentioned in the CPI report, must 
have its composition reorganized before the end of the week. 
Some of the current members of this committee are mentioned in 
the final CPI report, so they must be replaced. 
  [Begin Oliveira recording] The decisions of the Constitution 
and Justice Committee, which is made up of 54 members, are made 
through a vote. I believe that the congressmen mentioned in the 
CPI report must be removed from their posts by their party 
leaders. [end recording] 
  The government will also intensify the investigations on the 
involvement of Executive Branch officials in the budget scandal. 
A special investigative committee presided over by Federal 
Administration Secretary Romildo Canhim will be installed in the 
first week of February.

  [Excerpts] There was disorder in downtown Rio de Janeiro 
during the auctioning of Petroquimica Uniao. The privatization 
of the company has been postponed for the third time, and should 
be completed tomorrow. 
  The auction was not concluded because only 64 percent of the 
shares, worth 90 billion real cruzeiros, had been sold. In 
order to transfer the company it is necessary to sell 75 percent 
of the shares. Brokers will bid for the remaining shares 
tomorrow. 
  The auction lasted 11 minutes. The demonstrators, who were 
on the streets and did not get close to the stock market 
building because of security measures, decided to stage a march 
during which they stoned the facades of several banks in 
downtown Rio de Janeiro. A military policeman was wounded in the 
face, and a military police battalion closed the street. 
[passage omitted] 
  The march cut off traffic in Rio Branco Avenue, one of the 
main downtown avenues, and ended in front of the Petrobras 
[Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] building. 
  Two people were reported wounded during the incidents, but 
no 
one was reported arrested.

  [Text] The finance, planning, and mines and energy 
ministers yesterday announced -- two days ahead -- that fuel 
prices would be increased by 16.5-percent as of 26 January. 
  The peculiarity in this increase is that the price 
adjustment 
is lower than the inflation rate. 
  The fuel price adjustment for January will stand at 36.3 
percent, compared with 38.6 percent in December. This means the 
adjustment is 2.3-percent less. The drop is based on a cut in 
international oil prices and an increase in the productivity of 
Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation]. 
  This increase will have a 0.7-percent impact on the 
wholesale 
price index calculated by the Getulio Vargas Foundation. 
  Winston Fritsch, Finance Ministry economic policy secretary, 
said that the policy of correcting prices below the inflation 
rate will be extended to all the utility rates.

<F P=106> [Article by Carmem Cruz: "International Year Marks Defeat </F>
for Indians"] 
  [Text] Brazil's 262,000 Indians have little to commemorate 
in this International Year of Native Peoples, which they have 
turned into a year of struggle to get their lands demarcated. 
The government has demarcated fewer areas than in 1991 and 1992, 
over 80 percent of the lands already confirmed are still being 
invaded by lumbermen, prospectors, and ranchers, and violence is 
on the rise. The massacre of the Ianomamis in Roraima increased 
the number of murders to almost twice the total recorded during 
the past three years. Suicide among Guaranis is continuing. The 
new statute has not been approved, and the rights guaranteed by 
the 1988 Constitution may be undermined by revision. 
  It is an alarming picture, and it is made worse by the 
authorities' lack of commitment to solving such serious problems 
as the complete lack of health care for the Indian communities. 
Malaria and tuberculosis, Hansen's disease, and other illnesses 
are affecting the Ianomamis, whooping cough is claiming new 
victims among the Uru-eu-uau-uaus in Rondonia, and even 
influenza and measles are not under control because there is a 
complete absence of health workers and medicines in the area. 
Transferring responsibility for medical care to the Ministry of 
Health has resulted in chaos. Not because Funai [National Indian 
Foundation] was able to handle things adequately, but because 
the ministry, even though it has funds for providing the Indians 
with health care, has been unable to implement actions to 
provide the villages with the things planned during exhaustive 
meetings on the Esplanade of Ministries. 
  After two long years of quarreling over health care for 
Brazil's Indians, Funai and the Ministry of Health decided to 
meet during a seminar at CNTI [National Confederation of 
Industrial Workers] headquarters in Luziania and discuss 
long-awaited cooperation. That meeting had the effect of 
balancing the ministry's need to spend the thousands of real 
cruzeiros it has set aside with Funai's need to reactivate the 
village posts, which have deteriorated and, in most cases, been 
closed completely. That cooperation is to be modeled on the 
Ianomami Area Health District, the only unit that the ministry 
has managed to begin operating reasonably well in recent years. 
  Quarrels--As though the needs of the Indian 
communities--needs created precisely by the government's 
assistance policy--were not enough, quarrels over possession of 
the land on which they live or from where they have been 
expelled are making the daily life of many tribes a real hell. 
That is the case, for instance, with the Caiova Guaranis in Mato 
Grosso do Sul, who are in permanent conflict with the ranchers 
who have settled on their land. The Indians have been driven 
from their villages, and although their land has been 
demarcated, they cannot enter it. 
  Judge Suzana de Camargo Gomes in Campo Grande recently 
handed 
down a decision unfavorable to the Indians. It invalidated the 
president of the republic's directives and recognized the 
ranchers' right of possession as legitimate. The Indians are 
threatening to invade the area and die for their land. 
  In Roraima, where encouragement from Roraima society and 
Governor Ottomar de Souza Pinto in particular has been 
justifying incursions by prospectors into Indian areas, the 
conflicts in Ianomami territory culminated in the massacre of 17 
Indians, including women and children, in August. In the opinion 
of Francisco Loebens, secretary of Cimi [Native Missionary 
Council], that massacre was merely the continuation of the 
extermination process being imposed on the Ianomamis, who are 
perhaps the only group in the country to show a declining 
population curve. Also in Roraima, the Macuxi and Ingarico 
tribes, which live in the Raposa/Serra do Sol area, are being 
forced to coexist with the thousands of prospectors who have 
left Ianomami territory to settle along the rivers in the 
extreme northeastern part of the state. 
  The Raposa/Serra do Sol area is one of the two major areas 
which the Brazilian Government failed to demarcate this year, 
the reason being pressure from politicians in the North Region 
and from the military. The other area was the Upper Negro River 
area in the Amazon Region, which is also a border region. That 
area has been chopped up like the Ianomami area. Under the 
Sarney administration, as attorney Juliana Santilli of Cimi 
pointed out, the area had been divided into islands. Half the 
area that had been taken away was restored this year, but it has 
not been demarcated. 
<H5>  Demarcation the Big Battle </H5>
  The Upper Negro River area was ready to be demarcated, but 
the Ministry of Justice felt that in order to continue the 
process, previous decrees would have to be revoked. The military 
felt that demarcation along the border presented a danger to 
sovereignty. Everything came to a halt. 
  In Bahia, the Ha-Ha-Ha Pataxo Indians in Paul-Brasil have 
been struggling for decades to recover their lands, which are 
currently occupied by ranchers. They recently invaded three of 
the ranches in their territory and took hostages. The Military 
Police moved in, broke up the operation, and removed the 800 
Indians from the properties. The Indians do not have access to 
the river that runs through the area, and the local municipal 
government has stopped supplying them with water by water truck. 
  In southern Para, the exploitation of mahogany and other 
valuable species is jeopardizing vast Indian areas. The same 
thing is happening in Rondonia, where the leaders themselves 
participate in illegal deals and agreements. Besides harming the 
environment, that exploitation is causing a serious social 
problem by causing by breaking up the communities.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


<H5>  Groups Organized </H5>
  One unquestionably positive result for the Indians this year 
was the progress made by the leadership movement, which now 
includes more than 100 organizations. In Amazonas State alone, 
the Indians have 31 rank-and-file representative bodies, among 
them the Coordination Board for Indian Organizations of the 
Brazilian Amazon Region (COIAB) in Manaus and the Federation of 
Negro River Indian Organizations (FOIRN) in Sao Gabriel da 
Cachoeira. In the course of this year, they have held two major 
congresses in Brasilia and established the National Forum for 
the Defense of Indian Rights, which operates at Brasilia 
University (UnB) with the immediate objective of forcing the 
demarcation of Indian lands. 
  The union of those groups has resulted in more political 
debate and considerable progress in the struggle for autonomy. 
Many communities have started a struggle to recover their lands 
and even to demarcate those lands themselves. The Capaputo 
Indians in Alagoas have recovered areas which belonged to them 
traditionally and legally. The same thing has happened with the 
Bracui Guaranis in Rio de Janeiro and the Ha-Ha-Ha Pataxos in 
Bahia. 
  In the South, the Caingangs were able, partly by force, to 
demarcate their lands in an area being used for agrarian reform. 
The Jaguapires are continuing to confront the ranchers in an 
attempt to get back their lands in Mato Grosso do Sul. In 
Amazonas, the Culinas are also continuing to demarcate their own 
areas, which are in dispute between them and the owners of 
rubber plantations. But in addition to demarcating their land, 
the Culinas are evicting the rubber plantation owners in a 
peaceful atmosphere and also seeking ways to survive in a 
delimited area. The problem is that culturally, the Culinas move 
about a great deal, and now they need to plan ways to ensure 
their subsistence in a restricted territory. 
<H5>  Brazil Establishes Commission </H5>
  In Brazil, where the Indian question is arousing the concern 
and interest of organizations all over the world, the 
International Year of the Indian could not possibly have slipped 
by peaceably. Although it took four months to wake up to that 
fact, the Brazilian Government was eager to free itself any 
major guilt, so in April it issued a decree establishing the 
Commission on the International Year of Native Peoples. The 
commission consisted of representatives of the Ministries of 
Justice (Funai), Foreign Affairs, Education and Sports, Health, 
and Environment. 
  But at the commission's first meetings, which were held at 
Funai headquarters, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said firmly 
that it would not accept the terminology "Native Peoples" in the 
name of the commission: the expression should be "Native 
Populations." Although responsible for coordinating activities 
related to the international year, the commission did not take a 
single step forward; it wasted hour after hour quarreling about 
the name. 
  The quarreling discouraged the other members of the 
commission, who were surprised at the end of August by another 
decree from President Itamar changing the commission's name to 
Commission for the International Year of the Indian. 
<H5>  Opinion Still Divided on Guardianship </H5>
  Three proposals for the new Indian Statute were submitted to 
Congress: one from the Center for Indian Rights [NDI], another 
from Cimi, and the third also from the NDI. The special 
committee appointed to debate the bill submitted a substitute 
bill. The committee spokesman has been replaced, and now the new 
spokesman, Deputy Luciano Pizzato, after establishing a 
consensus between Funai, Cimi, and the NDI with the support of 
the Office of the Public Prosecutor of the Republic, will submit 
the results of the debates to the Indians themselves. 
  The most controversial issue in the new statute is 
unquestionably that of guardianship. The bill's authors agree 
that guardianship as it exists amounts to institutionalization 
and domination. The Indian is regarded as being relatively 
incompetent, since he is not a full citizen with complete 
rights. Funai would wind up being more of a protective force--a 
police body--and give up its social welfare or paternalistic 
activities. That is what the great majority of Indians want, 
although some groups such as the Caiapos, the Xavantes, and some 
of the Caingangs still associate the end of guardianship with 
the end of protection. 
  Revision--The Indians, nongovernmental organizations, and 
congressmen involved in the Indian cause in Brazil mobilized to 
oppose constitutional revision, feeling that the gains provided 
in the 1988 Constitution might be reversed by the current 
members of Congress. But revision was approved, and as a result, 
the move now is to mobilize in favor of retaining the articles 
dealing with the Indians. According to Deputy Marco Penaforte 
(PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], Ceara), chances are 
good that they will be retained in view of the short time 
remaining. The chapter on Indians and those on the environment 
and consumer protection have been taken off the constitutional 
agenda. If the articles are not retained, the next step will be 
to submit amendments reversing amendments aimed at destroying 
the rights already gained. 
  There are many such amendments, but some are causing more 
concern than others, one example being that by Deputy Nicias 
Ribeiro (PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], Para) 
(Constitutional Amendment No. 133/92), which bans the 
demarcation of lands in border areas and makes demarcations 
subject to approval by the National Congress. 
  The hope of the Indian leaders and of organizations 
defending 
the environment and the minorities is that as a result of the 
scandals in the National Congress, constitutional revision will 
be postponed. It has not made much progress so far despite the 
efforts of the supporters of constitutional revision. In any 
case, the way in which it is being proposed means that only a 
few aspects of the Constitution will be revised. 
<H5>  Individual Opinions </H5>
  Rubens Ricupero, minister of environment and the Legal 
Amazon 
Region: "The international year dedicated to the Indians should 
serve to remind us that respecting them, preserving their 
culture, and giving them dignified living conditions in their 
traditional environment means respecting ourselves." 
  Dinarte Madeiro, president of Funai: "The greatest gift we 
could have given the Indians in this international year would 
have been the demarcation of their lands. Unfortunately, that 
has not been possible because of the lack of funds. But we 
cannot blame President Itamar, because this situation has been 
dragging on for years." 
  Guenter Francisco Loebens, secretary of Cimi: "This year has 
led to closer coordination among the organizations concerned 
thanks to the establishment of the Forum for the Defense of 
Indian Rights. Those organizations have united and cast aside 
their particular differences in a struggle that has sought to 
make up for the government's ineffectiveness. The general 
realization today is that if the government will not do it, we 
will." 
  Waldir Tobias Macuxi, president of the Council for the 
Coordination of Native Peoples and Organizations of Brazil: "We 
Indians are all being used for propaganda purposes both in 
Brazil and abroad. They use us and invite us to international 
events, but they do not allow us to talk about the problems we 
face. Violence is increasing steadily, and the people committing 
that violence go unpunished." 
  Marco Penaforte, president of the Commission on Environment, 
Minorities, and Consumer Protection of the Chamber of Deputies: 
"The International Year of the Indian has not achieved its 
objectives in Brazil." 
  Juliana Santilli of the Center for Indian Rights (NDI): 
"There has been a lot of rhetoric, but little has been done. As 
far as demarcation is concerned, there has been progress, but it 
is far short of what should have been accomplished. Moreover, 
the conflicts in various areas are growing worse, and even 
though half of the Indian territories in Brazil have been 
demarcated, the Indians have not been given secure possession of 
their land."

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Oscar Camilion by Francisco </F>
J. Papinin; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Defense Minister Oscar Camilion has admitted that 
the incidents in Santiago del Estero Province were due to the 
fact that the province's intelligence services lacked adequate 
information. 
  In an interview with LA NACION, he also denied that he had 
said that Shining Path was active in that province. 
  Camilion described President Carlos Menem's 12 January 
meeting at the Olivos residence with civilian and military 
officials responsible for the country's internal and external 
security as "a preventive measure." 
  According to the minister, no reports were submitted, and 
for 
the most part, the discussion concerned the need to hone the 
work of the services by synchronizing them and making them work 
at full capacity because there are continental and national 
difficulties that can be taken advantage of by activists. 
  Camilion indicated that the president understands that 
up-to-date information must always be at hand in order to 
prevent social outbursts and thus be on the alert to prevent a 
major calamity if an outburst does occur. 
  He admitted that there are rumors that foreign subversive 
agents had been in the country, but there is no strong evidence 
that this happened. 
  The minister denied that Peruvian subversive agents had been 
active in Santiago del Estero. 
  "The difficult situations that have been caused by the 
reform 
are well exploited by the activists and misfits who exist in the 
world and who mobilize with drastic measures those who wish to 
express their discontent peacefully." 
  He stressed that in Olivos the president pulled the 
intelligence services out of their lethargy and urged them to 
work in coordination, "and, that was all that happened and no 
one should be alarmed, because what has happened in Mexico has 
no relation to what happened in Santiago del Estero, where the 
situation took a serious turn due to the passiveness of the 
policemen, who had not yet been paid their salaries." 
  The following are the main parts of the conversation: 
  [Papini] What is the role of the Armed Forces in collecting 
information? 
  [Camilion] You know that the Defense Law does not allow them 
to carry out intelligence activities within the country. Their 
field is information about the external situation. Currently we 
have a very real situation, which was discussed at Olivos, in 
which drug traffic originates abroad and then enters our 
country. This is where matters become somewhat confusing. 
  On the other hand, the Internal Security Law establishes 
that 
the Armed Forces can be asked to carry out actions within the 
country if the security forces are overrun. 
  The Armed Forces did participate in the Santiago del Estero 
incident. The Air Force and Navy used their planes to transport 
members of the Federal and Border Police Forces. 
  [Papini] Moving on to another topic, do you agree that 
Argentine military men should help remove the mines from the 
Malvinas Islands? 
  [Camilion] No. The fact that Argentine soldiers would help 
remove the mines from the Malvinas was never discussed. The 
country offered to make an economic contribution in removing the 
mines as an act of good will because those mines are harming the 
civilian population. The offer was made in accordance with the 
Madrid Protocol, which condemns the use of those artifacts by 
the belligerent parties. 
  [Papini] Will you do anything to prevent the promotion of 
the naval officers who have been objected to by some political 
sectors? 
  [Camilion] No, in no way. The matter is now in the hands of 
the Senate.

<F P=106> ["Summary" of interview with Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella </F>
by Daniel Santoro in Buenos Aires on 12 January -- copyrighted 
by CLARIN] 
  [Text] [Santoro] What was the reason for your presence at 
the meeting convened by President [Carlos] Menem at the Olivos 
presidential residence on Tuesday? 
  [Di Tella] The Foreign Ministry plays a marginal role in 
this 
issue because in some countries, not necessarily all neighboring 
countries, there are possibilities of subversive infiltration. 
We must follow political and socio-economic developments in 
Latin America closely, since they were the factors that 
triggered the crisis in Chiapas. Notwithstanding this, the 
president and all his cabinet think that the socio-economic and 
political situation in Mexico is totally different from 
Argentina. Our country's cultural, political, and 
socio-economic levels are more similar to those of Spain than to 
those of Mexico. 
  [Santoro] How does the Foreign Ministry view the events that 
took place in Chiapas? As a revolt organized by marginal 
Indians or a return to guerrilla outbreaks in Latin America? 
  [Di Tella] We believe that, besides socio-economic problems, 
the type of military organization and the hardware and weapons 
used by the Zapatist Army bear no resemblance to the ones 
illiterate and marginal people can manage to obtain. There is a 
very substantive organization that was mounted on the basis of a 
social problem. 
  [Santoro] According to confidential information that you 
have 
received, does this Mexican guerrilla group have any 
international connections? 
  [Di Tella] It has links to drug trafficking, which financed 
the purchase of those sophisticated weapons. The link between 
subversive guerrillas and drug trafficking has already been seen 
in Peru and Colombia. This may be a third case. 
  [Santoro] Sources close to the presidency have stated that 
the government has a CIA report that contends that there are 
allegedly Argentine guerrillas actively involved in Chiapas ... 
  [Di Tella] There is no CIA report. There was only an 
exchange of diplomatic information with the U.S. Department of 
State and other Latin American governments. 
  [Santoro] Has the Mexican Government reported about the 
Argentines? 
  [Di Tella] No, it has not. 
  [Santoro] Well, then, what was the basis of the president's 
public assertion that there are Argentines [involved in Chiapas]? 
  [Di Tella] (Silence). That was our first impression, but we 
had no confirmation. I can neither confirm nor deny it. 
  [Santoro] Was that "impression" based on an intelligence 
source ...? 
  [Di Tella] It was based on the fact that some people linked 
to Argentine guerrilla groups have been living in Mexico for a 
long time. 
  [Santoro] Are your referring to Montoneros? 
  [Di Tella] There are several groups that took refuge in 
Mexico. It is alleged that they have some links. As far as 
generic information, it is true, but we do not have precise 
facts to say that it is so-and-so or such and such a group that 
is operating there. The president has been concerned about the 
existence of that generic link for some time. 
  [Santoro] Why for some time? 
  [Di Tella] Because he knew that guerrilla groups had sought 
refuge in Mexico. 
  [Santoro] But that was in the 1970's and now the Montoneros 
have broken up, unless we are talking about Enrique Gorraran 
Merlo and the All for the Fatherland Movement ... 
  [Di Tella] I do not wish to discuss hypotheses. 
  [Santoro] At least you can make it clear whether you were 
talking about current guerrilla groups or those that date back 
to the 1970's ... 
  [Di Tella] To groups that operated in the 1970's. Many 
former guerrillas have entered the mainstream of politics in 
democracy, while others have not. 
  [Santoro] You were detained during the military regime. Are 
you not afraid that stirring up "ghosts" of the past might spark 
a "witch-hunt"? 
  [Di Tella] No, not in the least. Even though excesses were 
committed in the past, that does not mean that we cannot 
maintain order and security at present. Security forces can be 
put to good or bad use. They have been used appropriately since 
the reinstatement of democracy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo by Paz </F>
Tejerina, Facundo Landivar, and Eduardo De Simone: place and 
date not given] 
  [Text] [LA NACION] Industrialists complain because many 
provinces are prejudiced against removing the tax on gross 
income. Will cost reduction be merely an illusion? 
  [Cavallo] Productive sectors must be patient. We managed to 
get the Fiscal Pact signed and every province will now begin to 
provide benefits to a growing number of industries. Within a 
few months -- in all provinces -- the effect of reduced taxes 
and contributions will fully reach agricultural, manufacturing, 
mining, fishing, and construction industries. We hope tourism 
will also be included, as will passenger and cargo 
transportation. 
  [LA NACION] The official estimate foresees an annual 
reduction in costs of 4 billion pesos. But when? 
  [Cavallo] We hope that by the middle of this year all 
sectors 
throughout the nation will fully enjoy tax and social security 
benefits. 
  [LA NACION] Why do the provinces object to transferring 
their 
pension fund to the nation? 
  [Cavallo] Because there are strong interests around each 
fund. Some want the privileged provincial retirement system to 
continue. Some funds allow retirement at 45 on very high 
pensions. 
  [LA NACION] Which provinces are they? 
  [Cavallo] Almost all. The provinces also have a very large 
social security deficit. This averages at about 150 million 
pesos per month. 
  [LA NACION] What will you do to stop unemployment from 
growing? 
  [Cavallo] We have the intensive work program. The Ministries 
of Labor, Education, and Economy are carrying out training 
programs for our youth. This program will be intensified. 
  [LA NACION] Is unemployment the weak part of the plan? 
  [Cavallo] No, this plan is creating more jobs than what the 
Argentine economy has created. During the six years of Raul 
Alfonsin's administration 700,000 jobs were created while during 
the four years of President Menem's government 1 million jobs 
were created. What happened is like that which occurred in 
Mexico and in Chile: A greater participation of women in the 
labor demand. 
  [LA NACION] Will the social works system be deregulated? 
  [Cavallo] We will work with the ANSSAL [National Health 
Insurance Administration], the Labor Ministry, the CGT [General 
Confederation of Labor], and the unions on various fronts. 
First we must reorganize social works to improve services. 
Some union social works are very good but they can still be 
improved. Others, however, are lost causes and should be 
absorbed in an orderly process by the well managed social works. 
  The government is willing to pay off what it owes the social 
works as a result of its intervention if the unions accept the 
reorganization we propose. 
  Around the middle of this year we will also have a good 
computer system installed at the pension fund administration 
boards which will also help to put the social works in order. 
Only then we can talk about a deregulation program. 
  [LA NACION] Will measures be implemented to encourage merges 
and takeovers? 
  [Cavallo] Something like this is being done by the ANSSAL 
but 
I believe -- and this view is shared by the other ministers -- 
that we must intensify this task. This must be done through 
dialogue with the union leaders; we are waiting for the 
appropriate time to begin. 
  [LA NACION] What is the estimated trade deficit for this 
year? 
  [Cavallo] I do not know if it is wise to estimate. It makes 
sense to project a GDP growth of 6 to 7 percent or an inflation 
of under 5 percent, but not to estimate the deficit of the trade 
balance because this depends on the volume of capital. I do not 
have a target for this. I believe it depends on the will to 
invest. 
  [LA NACION] Does it not worry you that in the last few 
months 
the deficit is above all projections, including the projections 
of the economic team? 
  [Cavallo] No, because there was no target. Figures were 
prepared at the request of the IMF. The important thing is to 
have growing exports. Last year's growth was 7 percent and this 
year it will probably grow to between 10 and 12 percent. A 
repeat of what happened under the Austral plan must be 
prevented, when exports fell because there was greater 
consumption and also in some way what happened to investments 
within the context of relative prices and the organization of 
the economy which completely discouraged investment. 
  What is happening with exports is very interesting: The 
exports that are increasing most are those with greater added 
value. This shows that an industrial reorganization is taking 
place in Argentina. Products are being produced directly to be 
sold abroad. 
  [LA NACION] Is this not happening because there is no room 
on the domestic market: Some say consumption has reached 
saturation point or is even declining? 
  [Cavallo] No. Consumption continued to grow last year at 4 
to 5 percent, which is quite high. Of course, it is very good 
that consumption grew less than the GDP because this means 
domestic savings increased. Very few countries in the world 
increase their consumption at 3 percent or more per year. 
  [LA NACION] Nevertheless, it seems that consumption has been 
concentrated in a small segment of society while the great 
majority are unable to fulfill their basic requirements. 
  [Cavallo] Consumption level and growth rate are very 
different concepts. Some families still have a very low 
consumption because we inherited a country in which for decades 
there has been both stagnation and a constant worsening in the 
distribution of income. 
  I admit that there still are segments of the population that 
have low levels of consumption but, overall, everyone is 
consuming more. 
  [LA NACION] Does the Menem-[Cordoba Governor] Angeloz pact 
and the single voting ticket in Cordoba affect you? 
  [Cavallo] On the contrary, I am an economist; a single 
ticket 
enables us to save resources and efforts. 
  [LA NACION] Will you be a candidate for the Constituent 
Assembly? 
  [Cavallo] If there had not been a single list I would have 
considered it. In that case the Justicialist Party [PJ] should 
join a common front with the UCeDe [Democratic Center Union]. 
But with a single ticket, it would be senseless. 
  [LA NACION] With a single ticket, how can you criticize 
Angeloz during the campaign? 
  [Cavallo] I do not generally criticize Angeloz. I appreciate 
him but I think Cordoba should speed up its economic 
transformation, especially since it has a governor who, as a 
candidate, has said he will continue everything Menem is doing 
now. 
  As a Cordoba citizen I regret many things. I wonder why 
those in Cordoba pay much more for electricity than those in 
Buenos Aires; why do judges establish much higher fees for 
lawyers and experts than in the Federal Capital; and why are 
there still regulations on industry and commerce? 
  [LA NACION] Would you accompany Menem on the 1995 ticket? 
  [Cavallo] I have never considered it. I think the natural 
ticket would be Menem-Duhalde but, if Duhalde wants to remain as 
the governor of Buenos Aires Province, there are other top 
leaders who could occupy that post; Ruben Marin, Ramon Ortega, 
or Carlos Reutemann. 
  [LA NACION] If you ever become president, who would be your 
economy minister? 
  [Cavallo] I do not like hypothetical cases, but any of my 
secretaries or even under secretaries could be minister. There 
are also very good economists in the UCR. When the most 
important reforms had to be implemented, courage was as 
necessary as technical capacity and a good team. Some people 
say I am a fighter and that I sometimes shout, but I understand 
that someone with my personality was necessary. 
  [LA NACION] Following the case of Aluar [Argentine Aluminum 
Industrial and Commercial Corporation], are you not afraid of 
more cases of salary cuts in companies with problems? 
  [Cavallo] Salary cuts will probably be applied where 
salaries 
have been increased beyond productivity. I hope higher salaries 
will be cut first. I imagine Aluar first reduced the salaries 
of its high ranking executives. Companies must realistically 
face cuts in their costs. If salaries are higher than 
productivity in some sectors it is better to cut salaries than 
to stop production. 
  [LA NACION] Do you not think the salaries of many workers 
are 
low? 
  [Cavallo] Those salaries that are below the productivity 
level will continue to increase. Our statistics year after year 
reflect a sustained increase in real salaries. 
  [LA NACION] Many people would not agree. 
  [Cavallo] I think that the popular consumption level will 
increase because very few people earn less than 400 or 500 pesos 
per month. A few years ago many people did not even earn 200 
pesos. In the Federal Capital even domestic employees earn 600 
or 700 pesos.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Raul Alfonsin, leader of the </F>
Radical Civic Union, UCR, and former Argentine president, by 
Sergio Levit and Hugo Caligaris in Buenos Aires; date not given] 
  [Text] [LA NACION] What do you think of the Senate decision 
on the constitutional reform? 
  [Alfonsin] We would have liked to have seen it approved in 
the version approved by the lower house, with a four-year 
mandate for senators. 
  [LA NACION] Do you think this was an exclusive decision by 
the senators? 
  [Alfonsin] All the blocs voted in unison. I must admit I was 
unable to convince my fellow party members. 
  [LA NACION] Do you believe that the government has not 
helped 
in passing these changes? 
  [Alfonsin] No, not at all. 
  [LA NACION] There is a feeling that the pact was violated. 
  [Alfonsin] I would not use the word violated, but evidently 
it was not clear. 
  [LA NACION] Carlos Corach, legal and technical secretary for 
the presidency, said that the National Constituent Assembly will 
have sovereignty in discussing the articles mentioned in the 
law, and that within this sovereignty they will be able to do 
what they want with these articles. 
  [Alfonsin] Of course they may do so with the mentioned 
issues. I am convinced that we will improve a lot of things, 
that we will improve democracy. I am very satisfied with the 
agreements. 
  [LA NACION] Isn't it possible that Modin [Movement for 
Independence and Dignity] and Great Front will grow considerably? 
  [Alfonsin] No, they may obtain a few constituents. But in 
any case, after the Constituent Assembly we will have to speak 
with everybody. 
  [LA NACION] With the purpose of making an alliance for 1995? 
  [Alfonsin] No, I am not speaking of an alliance. I think 
that we Argentines must define a possible alternative to a new 
conservative project. 
  [LA NACION] How will that be? 
  [Alfonsin] I am thinking of a coalition government, a model 
like that in Chile. 
  [LA NACION] With whom? 
  [Alfonsin] With whomever wishes to defend a general project 
that will be an alternative to the neo-conservative project. 
  [LA NACION] Let us be clear. Does this definitively rule out 
the PJ? 
  [Alfonsin] No, we hope the Justicialists will convince 
themselves of our proposal. Why not? 
  [LA NACION] You do not rule out a coalition government with 
the PJ [Justicialist Party]? 
  [Alfonsin] I do not rule out anything. I think that many 
Justicialists are against the policies that are currently being 
carried out. So that is why we think Justicialists should be 
included. 
  [LA NACION] Do you mean the dissident Justicialists, the 
ones 
who do not agree with Menem? 
  [Alfonsin] I do not know. We will see. We hope they will be 
as many as possible, because the country will work better that 
way. 
  [LA NACION] Who will be the UCR candidate for 1995? 
  [Alfonsin] I cannot say. I think Angeloz is the one in the 
best position. Nothing of this has been discussed yet, nothing 
at all. 
  [LA NACION] Angeloz was not told anything? 
  [Alfonsin] Not one word. 
  [LA NACION] Will this coalition model be different from a 
political front? 
  [Alfonsin] I think so. 
  [LA NACION] Why don't you explain it further? 
  [Alfonsin] No, I will not explain it, because it is not the 
moment. We are not discussing that right now. 
  [LA NACION] What are we talking about, then? 
  [Alfonsin] I do not know, about anything you want. Do you 
want more insights? 
  [LA NACION] All right. In 1985 you said that Menem was the 
best governor in the country. 
  [Alfonsin] He gave me a great hand with the Beagle issue. I 
was indeed thankful for that. And I also gave him a great hand 
with his governorship. 
  [LA NACION] And now, after the long and public quarrels, 
what 
do you think of Menem? 
  [Alfonsin] Look, efforts have always been made to indicate 
that my opposition to the government was some kind of quarrel. 
This was done by sectors who not only detest politics, but are 
also uneasy with it. They are the ones who are uneasy about the 
current agreement, because this represents starting politics 
anew. 
  [LA NACION] Did the Radicals then lose four years with a 
useless quarrel? 
  [Alfonsin] You can see that in my speeches I always said we 
offered a hand to the president. 
  [LA NACION] You also said you were counting the days for his 
departure. 
  [Alfonsin] Yes, sir. We said that because it was impossible 
to say anything else with his hyperpresidential style. 
  [LA NACION] Can the dialogue with the government be expected 
to continue in the immediate future? 
  [Alfonsin] Yes, sir. Why not? We will demand dialogue. 
  [LA NACION] Would it be surprising, then, to see new 
high-level meetings on other issues? 
  [Alfonsin] Not in the least. There are issues like education 
which should be taken out of politics. We will also have a lot 
of discussion on foreign policy. But we will go with proposals. 
  [LA NACION] For example, what would the UCR do if there is a 
strike by the CGT [General Confederation of Labor]? 
  [Alfonsin] We will talk with all sectors. Yesterday we held 
a meeting with CGT lawyers. It is absolutely necessary to hold 
dialogue in the country. The word dialogue should now be the 
symbol in Argentina. 
  [LA NACION] Menem does not seem to discard the possibility 
of 
a new presidential term in 1999. 
  [Alfonsin] No, no, that is quite clear. I have no doubt 
whatsoever. 
  [LA NACION] That he will want to continue being president? 
  [Alfonsin] [laughing] No, no. That he will fulfill the pact. 
  [LA NACION] Why are you so confident that the guarantee 
that the agreement will be respected has absolute value? 
  [Alfonsin] The guarantee we are going to offer is our 
victory 
in the elections [of delegates for the Constituent Assembly]. 
There will be more delegates from UCR at the Constituent 
Assembly than from any other party. 
  [LA NACION] Why do you feel so confident that the UCR will 
score a victory in the elections? 
  [Alfonsin] It is very simple. Whenever there is a labor 
problem, people do not come to us, they have recourse to the 
CGT. Whenever there is an economic problem, many people will 
turn to the experts of the Mediterranea Foundation. Whenever 
there is a problem in soccer, people will resort to [Cesar] 
Menotti or [Alfio] Basile to solve it. Whenever there is a 
problem at the university, people get help from Franja Morada 
[mouthpiece for the UCR at the university]. Whenever there is 
an institutional problem, a problem confronting democracy that 
pertains to the institutions of the nation, people turn to us, 
the UCR. This is why we are going to win the elections. 
  [LA NACION] Are you really convinced of that? 
  [Alfonsin] Of course I am. When I ran for the presidency [in 
1983] and said for the first time that I was going to win the 
elections, people used to say: "He has bats in his belfry. 
Alfonsin has gone mad. How can he entertain such an idea?" And 
the UCR is going to win these elections, too. 
  [LA NACION] During an interview with LA NACION, President 
Menem told us that the chief cabinet minister will not usurp any 
of his power, not one single iota. 
  [Alfonsin] Well, he may say so if he wishes to. 
  [LA NACION] And don't you believe him? 
  [Alfonsin] It is not that I do not believe him. Do not try 
to make me argue with the president (he laughs). Read the law 
and draw your own conclusions. It is my considered opinion that 
the chief cabinet minister will have a very significant role. 
He may even act as a safety valve in difficult situations. If 
only I had had a law such as this. 
  [LA NACION] Do you believe the pressures exerted on the 
Supreme Court were justified? 
  [Alfonsin] We have always contended that the Supreme Court 
had to be modified. We have moreover requested some 
resignations in the Supreme Court, although we did not specify 
any names in particular. This is not tantamount to any type of 
pressure. I was asked to resign when I was president, and I so 
I did. It is a legitimate right to request the resignation of 
any government official. 
  [LA NACION] Then in that case, it would have been more 
legitimate to start proceedings for an impeachment. 
  [Alfonsin] Are you pulling my leg? 
  [LA NACION] No. 
  [Alfonsin] That would have taken at least two years. It 
would have been a scandal to try to conclude an impeachment in a 
month. That would have been really scandalous. 
  [LA NACION] Do you think the Supreme Court has now been 
enhanced? 
  [Alfonsin] I have no doubt whatsoever that it has. 
  [LA NACION] How is the domestic situation in some 
constituencies like Buenos Aires Province, or the capital city, 
going to be overcome? 
  [Alfonsin] We shall see. Whenever the different 
constituencies seek my advice about this, I suggest that 
agreements should be worked out to avoid holding primary 
elections. 
  [LA NACION] But in the city of Buenos Aires, for example, 
the 
ticket would then include Constituent Assembly delegates who 
have different stances on issues such as the president's 
reelection. 
  [Alfonsin] No, no. They may have their own personal 
opinions, but they will have to abide by what the party decides 
on that issue. What will surely happen is that their campaigns 
will differ; some will stress one thing, while others will 
insist on other things. 
  [LA NACION] Are you going to be a delegate? 
  [Alfonsin] I would really like to be a delegate (he laughs). 
  [LA NACION] Given the fact that you would really like to be 
a 
delegate, don't you feel like running for the presidency a 
second time? 
  [Alfonsin] No, absolutely not. 
  [LA NACION] Neither in 1995 nor in 1999? 
  [Alfonsin] I am going to be too old in 1999 (he laughs for a 
long while). 
  [LA NACION] Haven't you ever thought that you might poll 
fewer votes in April 1994 than in October 1993? What would you 
do in that case? 
  [Alfonsin] No, not at all. How could I entertain such a 
hypothesis? It is absurd that such an idea could ever cross my 
mind, so let us drop the subject.

  [Text] Economy Ministry sources disclosed that the 
government has not authorized the U.S. company American Airlines 
to increase the frequency of its flights to and from Argentina 
during the low season. 
  This refusal follows a similar one issued in November 
against 
a similar petition filed by American Airlines and United 
Airlines and supported by U.S. Ambassador James Cheek. 
  American Airlines was informed of the refusal while the 
economic team was holding meetings with Iberia officials to 
negotiate the possibility of increasing Argentine Airlines' 
capital. 
  An Economy Ministry official explained that the official 
refusal of American Airlines' proposal was prompted by Argentine 
Airlines' commitment to cover all the demand, which, according 
to the U.S. company, exceeds 60 percent of the available seats. 
  This gesture indicates that the government is issuing 
favorable signals to Argentine Airlines' operator. 
  The economic negotiation did not manage to find a solution 
to 
Iberia's petition to increase Argentine Airlines' capital. An 
official source said: "If it is not demonstrated that the 
company is economically viable, it is useless to make any 
capital contributions."

  [Excerpt] The Argentine Fishing Undersecretariat -- whose 
head, Fernando Gutierrez, tendered his resignation two weeks ago 
-- has been abolished. 
  This decision was made after a two-hour meeting between 
Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo and Felipe Sola, the 
agriculture, livestock, and fishing secretary. This was 
reported by Sola yesterday during a news conference. 
  The fishing functions will be exercised by the agriculture 
secretary, supported by a group of advisers who will not exceed 
the number of advisers already used by Gutierrez. 
  Sola will be supported by Felix Cirio, the under secretary 
for agriculture and livestock production and markets, who will 
replace incumbent Roberto Baltar in the Fishing Directorate, and 
Agrarian Economy Under Secretary Jesus Leguiza, who will 
contribute with statistical data on catches, fleets, and fishing 
economic reviews. Sola said: "This point definitely represents 
a weakness for us." [passage omitted]

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities monitored through 13 January. 
Source is cited in parentheses following each item. 
  Industrial production in 1993 registered its highest level 
in 
the past 14 years, despite increases in the unemployment and 
underemployment rates. According to polls by the main economic 
consulting firms, industrial production in 1993 increased 2.7 
percent compared with 1992, and 1.4 percent compared with 1987. 
The high industrial production level is the result of the 
sustained levels of capital inflow, totalling $13 billion in 
1993. (Buenos Aires LA NACION in Spanish 10 Jan 94 p 14) 
  The Association of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers has reported 
that automobile production registered the historical record of 
342,350 units in 1993, an increase of 30.7 percent compared with 
1992. Sales increased 31.4 percent. A total of 311,213 units 
were sold on the local market, and 29,976 sent abroad. (Buenos 
Aires LA NACION in Spanish 13 Jan 94 Section 2 p 1)

  [Text] Mexico City, 20 Jan (PL) -- The Belizean Armed 
Forces this year allotted $10 million to strengthen its military 
so it will be prepared to defend national sovereignty, 
government sources disclosed today. 
  This announcement is related to a statement made last 
November by Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel, who said that the 
imminent withdrawal of British troops from this state would 
probably encourage its Guatemalan neighbors to reclaim this 
territory, a former colony of the United Kingdom until 1983. 
  According to reports received in Mexico, spokesmen for the 
Belizean Government assured that the government is planning to 
gradually increase its troops in response to the withdrawal of 
the British, who defended the country until last 31 December. 
  The withdrawal of 1,200 men and combat equipment, including 
several squadrons of planes of various models, practically 
concluded on 1 January 1994. 
  According to official data, Belize has 1,000 armed men, 
while 
Guatemala has an army of 30,000 soldiers. 
  A representative of the Armed Forces said the objective was 
to add 1,500 men in 1994 and attract more recruits in the 
following years, depending on the state budget, while making 
structural changes in the corps. 
  Diplomatic sources in Belmopan said the internal situation 
was calm, even though Guatemala has on previous occasions tried 
to annex the territory. 
  Julio Roberto Herrera, Guatemalan vice consul in the 
neighboring Mexican city of Chetumal (southern state of Quintana 
Roo), said that from the times of the administration of Jorge 
Serrano Elias, his country has ruled out a military intervention 
in Belize. 
  After pointing out that Guatemala has other priorities, the 
diplomat said: "We respect the sovereignty of Belize, and even 
though we claimed that territory at one time, it doesn't mean we 
are planning an invasion."

<F P=106> [Article by Luiz Orlando Carneiro from Brasilia] </F>
  [Text] Cuban President Fidel Castro's invitation to former 
Brazilian President Fernando Collor to spend a few days in 
Varadero, a Cuban sea resort, has displeased Brazilian President 
Itamar Franco and has taken Itamaraty [Brazilian Foreign 
Ministry] by surprise. It is possible that Franco will eliminate 
from his agenda a meeting with Cuban Vice President [title as 
published] Carlos Lage Davila, who will be officially visiting 
Brazil 2-7 February. 
  Cuban Ambassador to Brazil Jorge Bolanos went to Itamaraty 
on 
21 January and told Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim that 
Castro's invitation to Fernando Collor was strictly personal. 
According to Itamaraty spokesman Luiz Fernando Benedini, the 
meeting between Minister Amorim and the Cuban ambassador had 
been scheduled in advance. Benedini denied that the ambassador 
had been summoned for an explanation. The spokesman refused to 
comment on behalf of the minister on the possible displeasure 
that Castro's invitation to Brazil's former president, found 
guilty of malfeasance in office, may have caused. 
  According to information on hand, the former president was 
supposed to go to Cuba as part of a business delegation together 
with his old friend, businessman Luiz Estevao. Collor was 
reportedly invited to stay at the official guest house in 
Varadero where his former wife Lilibeth Monteiro de Carvalho and 
his children Arnon Affonso and Joaquim Pedro have stayed in the 
past. The trip of the business delegation was postponed because 
the health of Luiz Estevao's father took a turn for the worse, 
but Collor confirmed that he plans to spend a few days in Cuba. 
Fidel Castro -- who still maintains a personal relationship 
with the former Brazilian president -- was unable to withdraw 
his earlier invitation. 
  Vice President Carlos Lage's official visit to Brazil had 
been arranged some time ago. Lage's agenda includes meetings 
with President Franco, Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, Finance 
Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and Health Minister Henrique 
Santillo. 
  [Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese on 21 January on 
page A6 carries a 200-word report noting that "on 22 January 
Collor will be boarding a plane for Cuba, the first leg of a 
30-day vacation. Collor, who is traveling with his wife Rosane, 
will visit Cuba, then go to Paris and end up in the Cap Ferrat 
resort in France."]

<F P=106> [Article from the opinion page by Foreign Minister Celso </F>
L.N. Amorim: "Brazil, Mercosur, and International Commerce"] 
  [Text] We are currently at the doorsteps of a new Mercosur 
[Common Market of the South] presidential summit, which will 
meet at a crucial moment for the consolidation of our common 
market. The occasion seems appropriate to make an analysis of 
the most recent events that in one way or another affect 
international trade and Brazil's insertion in the world economic 
system. Three facts seem particularly important, although in 
different degrees, from the viewpoint of Brazil's foreign trade: 
1) The U.S. Congress' approval of NAFTA and the fact that the 
agreement became effective on 1 January, 2) the conclusion of 
the Uruguay round of GATT talks after seven years of 
negotiations, and 3) the negotiations to establish Mercosur, 
particularly in the area of a common external tariff system. To 
this we may add President Itamar Franco's proposal during the 
last Rio Group presidential summit to create a South American 
Free Trade Area (ALCSA) that would be built around Mercosur and 
also include, within a 10-year period, Amazon Initiative and 
Andean Group member countries and Chile. 
  During the 1970's and 1980's we witnessed the consolidation 
of regionalization processes and the global character of 
international economic relations resulting from the growing need 
to reorganize the world economy, widen production scales, 
broaden markets, and contemplate the new preponderance of 
technical innovations. In Brazil, these trends coincide with the 
exhaustion of the imports substitution model and the 
deterioration of the state financial crisis. The answer to these 
changes, implemented rather brusquely by the previous 
government, was to unilaterally liberalize the foreign trade 
system and reduce the state's presence in economic activities. 
In the multilateral area, Brazil began to get increasingly 
involved in the Uruguay round of GATT talks. At the regional 
level, this emphasis was noticeable in Brazil's increasing 
economic integration with Argentina and the subsequent 
incorporation of Paraguay and Uruguay through Mercosur. 
  The implementation of NAFTA shows the U.S.' willingness to 
liberalize -- even though with limitations -- international 
trade. Although the discussion involving "trade creation" versus 
"trade deviation" is complex and not easily given to categorical 
evaluation, NAFTA should have a positive impact on international 
trade similar to the impact resulting from the establishment of 
the European common market. NAFTA's repercussions on Latin 
America are still subject to different views, but the fact that 
the impetus of the most protectionist U.S. groups has been 
contained is encouraging. 
  The implementation of GATT agreements by which developing 
countries grant Brazil an average tariff reduction of 38 percent 
will contribute, without a doubt, to ameliorating the effects of 
eventual trade deviations resulting from the tariff preferences 
granted Mexico through NAFTA. But that is not the only reason 
why the implementation of GATT agreements are particularly 
important for Brazil. The reinforcement of the multilateral 
trade system is essential to make international economic 
relations predictable and reduce the margin for sudden 
implementation of protectionist surges and unilateral decisions 
by our biggest trade partners. Because of the profile of 
Brazil's trade structure, which spreads almost evenly throughout 
all regions of the world, the strengthening of the multilateral 
system is of great importance to sustaining our internal 
economic reforms and shoring up efforts to achieve a more 
competitive insertion in the world economy. In this context, 
Brazil's interest in a strengthened multilateral trade system 
should encourage its efforts to consolidate Mercosur and 
establish a South American Free Trade Area. 
  The liberalization process within Mercosur member countries 
continues to progress as anticipated. It has resulted in a 
strong positive impact on trade exchange, which has more than 
doubled between the four member countries since the signing of 
the Asuncion Treaty in 1991. Today nearly 13 percent of 
Brazilian foreign trade involves our three partners (Argentina, 
Uruguay, and Paraguay). Brazilian exports to Mercosur countries 
have almost tripled from 1990 to 1993. The association between 
companies also has increased and contacts at all levels of 
society are becoming more frequent, generating the conditions 
for a true integration. Naturally, this exponential growth of 
trade flows has created some specific difficulties, which in the 
case of the proliferation of safeguards and anti-dumping 
measures can cause serious damage to our trade. They are not 
unsurmountable differences that cannot be ironed out with a 
frank and friendly dialogue between the four partners, however. 
  The difficulties encountered in defining a common external 
tariff system for some products such as digitized capital goods 
show the need for intense negotiations in the coming months. Our 
partners should perceive that even though the common market's 
advantages benefit all, the consolidation of that common market 
presupposes the preservation of absolute preference margins for 
some category of products for which it is important to have an 
integrated market. This is the case of products that still 
cannot compete on an equal footing with those produced by highly 
developed countries. Between the goal of promoting the country's 
competitive insertion in the world economy and renouncing our 
own industrial growth to sacrificing entire areas, particularly 
areas involving technologically developed products, there is a 
distance that cannot be ignored. 
  The Mercosur plan is essentially open and not exclusive. We 
should be prepared to be, at the right time, in a good 
negotiating position to talk with other regional groups in this 
hemisphere or outside it about broadened schemes of trade 
liberalization. It is essential, therefore, to strengthen the 
regional base of our insertion into the world by consolidating 
Mercosur and decisively encouraging the South American Free 
Trade Area.

<F P=106> [Interview with Luis Inacio Lula da Silva by Celia Cahim and </F>
Gilberto Nascimento on 13 January; place not given] 
  [Text] [JORNAL] How will the two events that recently 
occurred in the ABC [Santo Adre, Sao Bernardo do Campo, Sao 
Caetano do Sul, industrial area] -- namely the murder of trade 
unionist Oswaldo Cruz Junior and the attack on two trade 
unionists linked to Cruz which took place a week later -- affect 
your candidacy? 
  [Lula] The sectors that seek to implicate the PT [Workers 
Party] do so precisely because they expect it will adversely 
affect my image and standing in public opinion polls. We wish 
to tell the public that moves like this against the PT have been 
attempted several times in the past, even to the abduction of 
Abilio Diniz in 1989. I do not expect any of my political 
enemies to sing my praises. I have no illusions about that. 
What concerns me is that there seems to be no hurry to capture 
the murderer so that he can explain why he did it. With regard 
to the alleged attack [on the trade unionists], there are also 
very contradictory reports. We will once again circumvent the 
problem and prove that this dirty trick on the PT, which began 
immediately prior to the elections in 1989, has now been 
restarted nine months before the next elections. 
  [JORNAL] Do you think you took too long to react to 
allegations concerning the PT's involvement in these events? 
  [Lula] No. Following my political strategy, and out of 
respect for his widow, Valeria [Cruz], I had no interest 
whatsoever in getting involved in an altercation when the 
deceased had not even been buried. Furthermore, I believe the 
truth will out. It is already coming into the open via some odd 
coincidences -- the same police superintendent of the Diniz case 
is involved, the same accusations are being leveled by the same 
enemies, and the same insinuations are being made by the press. 
Fortunately, these two cases will be settled in a speedy 
fashion. Once Zeze [Jose Benedito de Souza] is arrested, we 
will know who is who in this story. The same old vultures, who 
were thirsting for prey, are already leaving. 
  [JORNAL] Following that line of thought, you can expect to 
come under intense fire until October. Are you ready to face, 
let us say, another issue similar to the one involving Miriam 
Cordeiro? [who named Lula on television as the father of her 
child] 
  [Lula] If I were not prepared, I would not be a candidate. I 
base my actions on the following premise: When voters cast 
their votes in the ballot-box, they choose the candidate who can 
solve the problems that confront their country, city, or state. 
They are not interested in his private life. 
  [JORNAL] But you are dealing with people who have not gone 
to 
the polls for 30 years and therefore lack that degree of 
political maturity. 
  [Lula] I will lead my campaign at the highest possible 
level. 
This will entail a certain degree of politicization of our 
society. We will not play the game the same way as our 
adversaries. We will not exploit everything that pertains to 
political charges. I am not interested to know whether a person 
drank or not, or whether he smoked marijuana when he was young. 
That is his problem, not mine. 
  [JORNAL] And yet, your adversaries are interested in 
learning 
about and publicizing your past indiscretions. 
  [Lula] I have no problem with that. They can do as they 
please. I cannot campaign for the presidency with fear. If the 
people want a program that provides solutions for the problem of 
hunger, health care, agricultural policy, and income 
distribution, they have a candidate. If they want to vote for 
those who practice foul play, I will be deeply sorry because 
Brazil will fare worse at the end of the century than at the 
beginning. 
  [JORNAL] Is the Brazil you envisage a socialist state? 
  [Lula] No. We want to implement a government program which, 
regardless of its name, understands the need to resume a 
different type of growth from the one that characterized the 
1970's and to implement an income distribution policy. We 
cannot just emulate European or U.S. development models. We 
need a national development program to help transform the 150 
million Brazilians into citizens. 
  [JORNAL] Are you a socialist? 
  [Lula] I do not like labels. I am a lathe operator and a 
mechanic. The PT does not intend to govern the country 
following a socialist-style model. We are separating what is a 
strategic program, a dream of society, a utopia, from a 
five-year government program. If we manage to solve our basic 
problems, we will undoubtedly bring about a revolution -- 
regardless of its name. 
  [JORNAL] What is the difference between the program of the 
PT and the others? 
  [Lula] We are going to do the obvious. We guarantee that 
within five years all children of school age will be attending 
school. We guarantee that within five years there will be a 
health system under which people will not be treated like 
animals. We guarantee that this country will produce 150 
million tonnes of grain, instead of making a lot of fuss about 
our present 70 million-tonne production. Each person will have 
the right to three meals a day. These are basic things which, 
if accomplished, would be tantamount to a revolution. People 
keep discussing privatization, nationalization, opening borders, 
etc. when reality shows that our people are famished, 
unemployed, and overcome by despair. 
  [JORNAL] But important sectors want answers for those issues 
that you relegate to second place, seeking to assure 
governability. 
  [Lula] Nobody will close our borders, but by the same token, 
nobody will open the sluices so that our country becomes a 
duty-free zone. This is why we want to devise a national 
project to provide a strong industry and import quotas. It is 
all very well to talk about opening our borders, but it would be 
even better to know who will solve the problem of unemployment 
in Brazil. The role of the state is to find a way to create 
more jobs. Brazil cannot be a modern country with only 30 
million consumers. It will become a modern country when 
children have shoes, schooling, milk, and health care. This is 
the project we want to implement and that everybody promises to 
further during the election campaign. [Former President 
Fernando] Collor said that his modernization project would place 
our country on a same footing as France. The truth is that we 
resemble Ethiopia. One need only look under the bridges. 
  [JORNAL] In your view, what is modernity? 
  [Lula] It is not the modernity of Norwegian codfish or 
imported cars. Those who can afford to buy an imported car may 
do so. Nevertheless, our priority is that people may be able to 
eat, work, and live decently. This is the miracle we want to 
perform in Brazil and we are convinced that it may be 
accomplished. 
  [JORNAL] Is it possible to accomplish that miracle in just 
five years? 
  [Lula] Part of it can be accomplished in five years. We can 
set goals to be attained in two, three years. We will ensure 
that Macapa city dwellers, for example, do not have to eat 
tomatoes from Sao Paulo. Our agricultural policy should create 
green belts around each city so that people may obtain their 
staples at more reasonable prices. 
  [JORNAL] What would you tell those who fear that your 
victory 
might be the victory of an old-style socialist? In past 
elections, your adversaries convinced some of the electorate 
that you were going to divide three-bedroom apartments. 
  [Lula] The most reactionary sectors think like that, but 
society already knows the PT administrative experience. There 
was a time when a politician could distinguish himself by 
building a great viaduct, but that is over. The people want to 
know: Is my street paved? Does it have a sidewalk? Brazil 
needs an about-face. 
  [JORNAL] How will this about-face affect the financial 
sector? 
  [Lula] During a meeting with bankers, I told them that banks 
will continue to operate normally, but that the financial system 
cannot continue to fuel inflation as a way to make more money. 
In the industrialized world, banks have a 4-percent 
participation in the GDP, whereas in Brazil that percentage goes 
as high as 13 percent. Here, the Central Bank makes money 
through speculation, the Social Security makes money through 
speculation. Many people foster speculation to make money. 
  [JORNAL] How can one check this? 
  [Lula] The financial system must be convinced that it can 
make money by supporting the productive sector. I intend to 
discuss with the financial system an agreement to extend the 
profile of the government's domestically contracted debt. In 
Italy, the domestic debt represents 5 percent of the GDP while 
inflation runs at 6 percent. Here in Brazil, our domestic debt 
represents 24 percent of the GDP and the inflation stands at 40 
percent a month. The basic difference is the time-frame of the 
rescheduling of the debt. Italian securities have a 20-year or 
30-year maturity; here one has to pay every three months. 
  [JORNAL] What have you discussed with representatives of 
foreign companies and businessmen? 
  [Lula] I have told them of the great harm we can cause by 
obliging them to double their production. We do not want to 
continue to be a country with 30 million consumers. I have 
explained that we do not want to act like hustlers in the dead 
of the night acting without agreements. We want to establish 
clear rules of the games with businessmen and workers, and 
demand that these rules be obeyed. Sometimes I prefer a 
gentleman's agreement to a law. We will work to encourage 
foreign capital to invest in Brazil. Obviously, I cannot 
implement a program to only please Volkswagen. I must implement 
a program to please the 150 million Brazilians, a program in 
which the neediest will take priority over the rest. 
  [JORNAL] How will you tackle the privatization issue? 
  [Lula] Strategic industries will continue to be owned by the 
state. We want public companies, not state-owned enterprises. 
Why public? Because they will not have a huge payroll nor will 
they be obsolete. They will be modern companies that offer 
better services. I have time and again said that oil is 
strategic; so much so that the United States did not hesitate to 
spend $30 billion on the war against Iraq to preserve its 
international reserves. The current telecommunications system, 
in which the state retains control while freeing the production 
of equipment, is interesting. We will not engage in a drive 
that may render the state vulnerable. With regard to the 
privatization of highways, entrepreneurs are interested in the 
Dutra, Anchieta, Imigrantes, and Bandeirantes highways. Nobody 
wants the Rio de Janeiro-Bahia highway to be privatized. Why 
don't businessmen create a pool [previous word in English] to 
construct new highways and then manage them? They should 
repatriate the money that they have invested abroad. 
  [JORNAL] You are criticized for your lack of administrative 
experience and for not having a regular job. What do you have 
to say about this? 
  [Lula] Recalling Collor's experience, I may venture to say 
that I do not envy the administrative experience of the 
Brazilian elite. The purchasing power of the workers declined by 
50 percent since 1985 and 32 million people live in squalor. 
What administrative experience are we talking about? The 
experience of hiring building contractors for great public works 
just to collect the bribes they offer is not and will not be the 
slogan of my government campaign. I am proud to say that I am an 
official working for my party. I work at least 10 times harder 
than when I was a metallurgist. 
  [JORNAL] Who will fund your election campaign? 
  [Lula] We hope to obtain contributions from people and 
firms. 
We will open a bank account to receive contributions. We will 
do everything above board and tell businessmen -- those who want 
to contribute to my campaign do not have to do so via a secret 
account. 
  [JORNAL] Public opinion polls show that 30 percent of the 
people would vote for you. Do you believe you have already won 
the election? 
  [Lula] No. The election campaign begins after the party 
conventions, when all the parties register their candidates. 
And yet to head the polls for such a long time, withstanding 
the vollies of taunts I have to endure, really shows that my 
candidacy is very strong. I am convinced that we will win in a 
runoff. If we work in an upright manner we may score an 
election victory in the first round. One should be aware that 
the game is just beginning, that everything remains to be done, 
and that one is not successful at the polls until after the vote 
count is over. 
  [JORNAL] Against whom will you fight the runoff? 
  [Lula] I am not concerned with choosing adversaries. Part of 
the elite, the most conservative one, is an orphan. For all its 
efforts, it has no candidate. I have no doubt that these 
elections will be hotly contested. There will be at least five 
or six candidates and I do not know who I would like to face in 
the runoff. I would rather defeat them all in the first round. 
  [JORNAL] If you are elected president you will have to 
confront pressures from both the elite and the working class. 
  [Lula] We are well aware that on one hand an elite force 
will 
pressure us in an attempt to hinder us from governing, while on 
the other hand millions of workers will pressure us to overcome 
in three months problems that have not been solved for 
centuries. We are not going to wait until the campaign is over 
to start holding talks. This is why we want to draft a very 
feasible program. Pressure is important and is a peculiar trait 
of democracy. 
  [JORNAL] But, does the PT have cadres to govern? 
  [Lula] Following the cabinets of Collor, Itamar Franco, and 
Jose Sarney, saying that the PT does not have cadres is a bit of 
a joke. For each of their cadres, we have 10. But I do not 
intend to form a government only from PT cadres. I will look 
for people outside the party who are honest, able, and 
politically aware of the social problems confronting the 
country. We want to form alliances not only to win the 
elections but also to rule the country. 
  [JORNAL] Will you demand guarantees from the military? 
  [Lula] I am going to talk with the military. I want to hold 
talks with the Army, Navy, and Aeronautics ministers because 
they represent consolidated and necessary institutions. I want 
to know their views about Brazil and about the problems of each 
branch of the Armed Forces. I am going to take that initiative 
and try to discuss things at the War College; but I am not going 
to demand guarantees, because the role of the Armed Forces is 
defined in the Constitution. 
  [JORNAL] What can you say to dispel any misgivings about 
Lula's government. 
  [Lula] Entrepreneurs could have misgivings if the PT were 
involved in corrupt practices, if it were involved the Budget 
Committee, or if public works were over invoiced. To be afraid 
of honesty is sui generis. There is no need for anybody to be 
afraid. 
  [JORNAL] And yet, the left wing of the PT even scares the 
middle class. 
  [Lula] The left wing of the PT is necessary. Any party with 
any self-respect has a left and a right wing. We do not want to 
be a government with a subservient party. We want society to 
nudge us all the time. The PT government does not wish to 
become the prisoner of that glass case called Planalto Palace.

  [Text] Porto Alegre -- Digitel Electronic Industry, Inc. 
has shipped 250 modem units, model DT 32B, to Kiev, in the 
Ukraine. This is the first lot of a $500,000 export operation. 
The first export to eastern Europe is consigned to the 
UkrSots-Bank, a bank in the Ukraine. Digitel contracted with 
this bank to supply modem units with a speed of 14,400 bits per 
second for each telephone line dialed. 
  The second largest data communications equipment 
manufacturer 
in our country, Digitel has other plans as well. Digitel 
President Gilberto Machado said: "We intend to transfer the 
technology of our products keeping in mind the huge potential 
for exports to the former Soviet Union." 
<H5>  New Markets </H5>
  In order to gain new markets and increase the number of 
customers, especially in eastern Europe, Digitel participated in 
the Computer Science and Communications Fair held in Kiev last 
year. Digitel has also already signed a coopeation agreement 
with the Ukrainian enterprise Vector-Scientific Novation Company 
to represent Digitel in that country. 
  In its strategy to diversify its exports, Digitel signed a 
letter of intent in December with the state-run enterprise China 
National Post Telecommunications, the Chinese equivalent to 
Embratel [Brazilian Telecommunications Company], seeking the 
establishment of a joint venture. The goal is to facilitate the 
importation of data communications equipment for a fabulous 
potential market in which the Chinese Government plans to invest 
$60 billion within the next five years. 
  According to Gilberto Machado, after entering partnerships 
with six U.S. companies, Digitel will open a company of its own 
in Miami, in the United States. Digitel is scheduled to receive 
its ISO-9000 enterprise certificate (international quality 
certificate) in March, after one year of conforming to 
international standards and investing $1.6 million in equipment, 
training, and internal changes. 
  Digitel's modem line has more than 20 models of high-speed 
and multiplexor modem units.

<F P=106> [From the "JB Report" column by Teodomiro Braga] </F>
  [Text] Maneuvers, pressures, and last-minute conspiracies 
wiped out half a dozen names from the Budget CPI's 
[Congressional Investigating Committee] list of people who will 
have their political rights stripped, thus making the CPI's 
final report look somewhat like a pizza. 
  The name of Deputy Jose Luis Maia, the PPR [Progressive 
Renewal Party] leader in the Chamber of Deputies and a friend of 
[former Sao Paulo Governor Paulo] Maluf, was removed from the 
list due to pressures from the party leadership, while the 
Senate's corporatism saved Senator Saldanha Derzi, the Sarney 
administration's last leader in the Chamber of Deputies. 
  Maia and Derzi were condemned by the subcommittees that also 
incriminated the dwarf [referring to the so-called `seven 
dwarfs' inner circle of corruption] Jose Carlos Vasconcelos, who 
was also helped by corporatism. 
  PDT [Democratic Labor Party] leader Luiz Salomao credited 
Paes Landim's removal from the list of those indicted to an 
alleged agreement between the PT [Workers Party] and the Sarney 
group. 
  Pressure from the Bahia State PFL [Liberal Front Party] 
saved 
Deputy Jose Carlos Aleluia from the guillotine. Aleluia was 
reported by the amendments subcommittee as a "forwarding agent" 
for construction companies in Congress. 
  Previous arrangements had already saved a group of sure 
candidates for having their political rights stripped, like 
Senator Mansueto de Lavor and the dwarf Messias Gois. 
  The CPI's portion of the pizza would have been much larger 
had it not been for the resistance from rapporteur Roberto 
Magalhaes, who had received strong appeals to remove other names 
before sending the report to the printing shop.

  [Editorial Report] The following ia a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Brazil monitored through 20 
January. 
  According to the Getulio Vargas Foundation, the 1993 
inflation rate measured by the Average General Price Index,

<F P=106> [Article by Itamar Garcez] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia--The Judiciary Branch is the chief target 
of legislators working on the constitutional revision. About 25 
percent of the more than 17,000 proposals for amendments that 
have been submitted deal exclusively with the courts and the 
magistrates. Article 93, for example, which governs the 
magistracy, was the favorite of deputies and senators, who 
suggested about 640 modifications in it. This statistic, a 
preliminary finding by Prodasen [Federal Senate Data Processing 
Center], confirms expectations that the National Congress wants 
outside control over the Judiciary. 
  The desire to set limits on the actions of judges is nothing 
new. Ever since the Constituent Assembly of 1988, legislators 
have had the Judiciary Branch in their sights. To repeat that 
year's success, when they survived unscathed despite many 
pressures, the judges will have to work a good deal harder. 
Legislators of all stripes have already catalogued their 
suggestions. Sao Paulo Deputy Jose Genoino (PT) [Workers Party], 
like his colleague Jose Dirceu (PT, Sao Paulo), proposed a 
Council of Justice to exercise administrative, financial, and 
disciplinary control over the judiciary. 
  Rondonia Senator Odacir Soares, (PFL) [Liberal Front Party], 
wants to end the lifetime appointment of ministers, so he 
proposes a 12-year term of office. His colleague in the Chamber, 
Para Deputy Luis Carlos Hauly (PP) [Progressive Party], goes 
further: he wants to give the Legislative Branch the power to 
remove ministers from superior courts by a vote of "no 
confidence" to be approved by an absolute majority of 
deputies--the same quorum required to approve any proposal in 
the constitutional revision--293 votes. 
  This predilection to suggest changes in the Judiciary has 
not, however, prevented deputies and senators from setting to 
work on all areas. In the most recent survey done by Prodasen, 
Article 138, which contains the rules governing a state of 
siege, was the only one not on the list of proposed changes. At 
the other extreme, Article 5, on the rights and duties of 
citizens, ranked second as a target of the legislators. More 
than 610 proposals seek to modify that long constitutional 
provision, which has 77 subsections. 
  For example, it is in Article 5 that Rio de Janeiro Deputy 
Amaral Netto (PPR) [Progressive Renewal Party] will try, once 
again, to insert a point on which he has been adamant: the 
plebiscite on the death penalty. The members of this Constituent 
Assembly will not have much luck, however, since Article 5 is 
one of the clausulas petreas, provisions that 
according to Article 60, paragraph 4, cannot be amended. 
  The major topics will probably be: the tax structure, the 
petroleum and telecommunications monopolies, social security, 
the civil service, the public administration, congressional 
representation formulas, the federative pact, and agrarian 
reform. 
<H5>  [Boxed chart page 8] </H5>
  Prodasen has just completed a preliminary survey of proposed 
changes in the Constitution. Using these figures, it will be 
possible to identify the legislators' principal interests. The 
survey categorized 17,269 proposals for revision. Here is a look 
at what the legislators have in mind.

<F P=106> [Article by Ilimar Franco] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia--Jolted by the Budget CPI [Congressional 
Investigating Committee], bereft of a candidate, and rudderless, 
the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] is experiencing 
its toughest political times ever. Brazil's largest party enters 
the preliminary phase of another presidential election with no 
prospects of victory. After being turned down by the PSDB 
[Brazilian Social Democracy Party], which does not want to be 
part of a coalition, the PMDB is being courted by [Rio] Governor 
Leonel Brizola, who is interested in using the party's structure 
to support his own candidacy. Internally, the situation could 
hardly be more complicated. None of the likely candidates for 
the presidency--Antonio Britto, Orestes Quercia, Jose Sarney, 
Pedro Simon, or Luiz Antonio Fleury--is uniting the party. 
  PMDB President Deputy Luiz Henrique (Santa Catarina), 
believes the party's best hope is to elect a huge delegation to 
the Chamber of Deputies and the state legislative assemblies. "I 
have no doubt the PMDB will win a majority in the Congress," 
said Tarcisio Delgado (Minas Gerais), its leader in the Chamber. 
Despite being cut to the quick by the investigations of Deputies 
Ibsen Pinheiro (Rio Grande do Sul) and Genebaldo Correia 
(Bahia), the pmdebistas believe they can come out on 
top. "Unlike some other parties, we are not putting obstacles in 
the path of the investigation, nor are we protecting the 
pmdebistas involved," charged the president of the 
Sao Paulo PMDB, Deputy Roberto Rolemberg. "We installed a 
traditional adversary from the Right as chairman of the CPI 
(Senator Jarbas Passarinho (PPR-PA) [Progressive Renewal Party, 
Para]), and we ensured the presence of a traditional adversary 
from the Left on the CPI (Senator Eduardo Suplicy (PT-SP) 
[Workers Party, Sao Paulo])," Tarcisio added. 
<H5>  Top Leaders Optimistic </H5>
  "We would come out of this weaker had we tried to impede the 
investigations," argues Luiz Henrique, convinced that the public 
will understand that the responsibility rests with individuals, 
not with the party. But although the top PMDB leadership is 
optimistic about the outcome of the CPI and even though it is 
the most affected party, the same cannot be said of the process 
of selecting its candidate for president of Brazil. The 
strongest man, Rio Grande do Sul Deputy Antonio Britto, former 
minister of social security, has withdrawn his name from the 
contest in principle, after receiving signals that the 
quercistas would not support him. Former [Sao Paulo] 
Governor Orestes Quercia, who had been torpedoed by a long list 
of charges of illicit enrichment, has resurfaced and is 
attempting to revive his candidacy for either Planalto Palace or 
[Sao Paulo's] Bandeirantes Palace, but does not have his party's 
support. 
  "We have candidates for every taste," said Rio Grande do Sul 
Senator Pedro Simon, the administration's leader in the Senate 
and another influential name vetoed by the 
quercistas. Amapa Senator Jose Sarney dreams of being 
a candidate, but in recent conversations with politicians has 
acknowledged that this would be feasible only with Quercia's 
seal of approval. Even so, it would be a candidacy weakened by 
charges of corruption and a lack of support from the historical 
leaders of the PMDB. [Sao Paulo] Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury 
would not unite the party; proof of this was furnished when he 
was left alone in his campaign to have the party abandon the 
Itamar Franco administration, two months ago. 
  With so many problems, it will be hard for the party to 
decide on a candidate within the first two months of 1994, as 
its president and its leaders in the Chamber and Senate would 
like it to do. "That would be the ideal, but I'm afraid it won't 
happen," said Tarcisio Delgado. Simon concurred, saying: "There 
is no natural candidate." 
  Governor Leonel Brizola has already taken note of the PMDB 
dilemma and decided to rush in and see whether this situation 
could benefit the PDT [Democratic Labor Party]. Deputies Vivaldo 
Barbosa and Neiva Moreira, both from Rio, have agreed with Luiz 
Henrique and Tarcisio Delgado that the two will meet with 
Brizola on Wednesday. The pedetistas think there is a 
lot of affinity between the two parties. 
<H5>  Infernal Luck From January to December </H5>
  1993 was a year of chaos for the PMDB. Shaken by a 
succession 
of crises, the party is more divided than ever and the domestic 
crisis which, paradoxically, has been nourishing it since the 
military regime, has deepened. The PMDB began the year debating 
whether or not to participate in the Itamar Franco government. 
Party President Orestes Quercia was ultimately defeated, and the 
position taken by government leader Rio Grande do Sul Senator 
Pedro Simon in favor of the Itamar administration prevailed. But 
this would not be the last defeat for Quercia, who, attacked by 
former allies like Ibsen Pinheiro and Genebaldo Correia, ended 
up resigning the party presidency in May after becoming 
increasingly isolated politically. 
  The debates on the wage policy approved by the Chamber's 
Labor Committee, which raised wages by 100 percent, split the 
PMDB once again. Senator Jose Sarney defended the proposal 
against the Itamar Franco administration and its leader in the 
Senate, Senator Pedro Simon. Sarney argued that his 
administration had also been subjected to such a wage policy 
against his will but, if it had not been for the chaos, that 
same policy would be in effect under the present government. 
Sarney was defeated within the PMDB when the Senate rejected the 
proposal that had passed the Chamber. 
  The administration would split the PMDB again in August, 
when 
Itamar Franco decided to fire BNDES [National Bank for Economic 
and Social Development] President Delben Leite. Sao Paulo 
Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury, who had never advocated that the 
party participate in the government, took advantage of the 
episode to suggest that the PMDB withdraw from the 
administration. Fleury ended up being crushed by the actions of 
party heavyweights like Sarney, Quercia and Simon. 
  The party began the year divided on questions of government 
and ends 1993 with the same problem. But now the reason for the 
discord is the appointment of the government's leader in the 
Chamber. Deputy Luiz Henrique told President Itamar Franco last 
Wednesday that the party does not want to nominate the 
government's leader in the Chamber. Senator Pedro Simon thinks 
otherwise. They all agreed to postpone the problem, so the 
leader will probably not be chosen until 10 January. 
  The Budget CPI was like a massacre for the party. The 
largest 
number of people involved in the scandal, whose victims included 
two important party leaders--Ibsen Pinheiro and Genebaldo 
Correia--are from the PMDB. Other respected names, such as 
Senators Humberto Lucena (Paraiba) and Mauro Benevides (Ceara), 
came out of it with tarnished images. The PMDB is the party with 
the highest number of "dwarfs," the legislators [all short men] 
who ran the Budget Committee and all the irregularities 
committed on it. 
  As for the policy of forging alliances with an eye to the 
presidential election, a lot could happen--at least in Sao 
Paulo--most probably in the runoff. "In the first round, it is 
possible there might be a `white' coalition," announced Sao 
Paulo State Deputy Joao Leiva, a quercista and vice 
president--now acting president--of the paulista 
party board. A "white coalition" means respecting one's 
opponent, avoiding making accusations or giving offense, in 
order to facilitate an alliance for the runoff election. The 
easiest, and most likely arrangement would be with the PSDB, 
despite the hesitation of the tucanos Leiva reported 
that there is also pressure for an alliance with Paulo Maluf's 
PPR. If Maluf does not run for president, as it seems he will 
not, the PPR backing could be of great help to the PMDB. 
Definitely ruled out is an alliance with the PT. 
  Despite the current dissension--Quercia against Fleury in 
Sao 
Paulo, and Quercia against other potential candidates--the 
quercistas anticipate that the PMDB will unite when 
the convention rolls around. 
<H5>  [Boxed story bottom of p 4 by Jose Maria Mayrink] </H5>
<H5>  Sao Paulo: Fleury Leads, But Quercia Gives the Orders </H5>
  Heir to a powerful and well-oiled administrative machine, 
Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury is the PMDB's official leader in 
Sao Paulo, but the one who still calls the shots in the party is 
his predecessor, Orestes Quercia. Supposedly allies, the two are 
drifting further and further apart in this preelection phase 
when both are trying to open up a route to Planalto Palace while 
insisting publicly that they are not candidates. They are not, 
but they want to be. 
  Quercia does not conceal his interest in the presidency of 
the Republic and if he is not ready to openly admit that he is a 
candidate, it is because he wants to know first who his 
opponents would be. He promises to return to the political scene 
permanently in January after giving explanations to the PMDB 
National Executive Committee regarding charges of corruption. 
Quercismo controls more than 70 percent of the PMDB 
directorships in the 625 Sao Paulo municipalities. Next year, 
the State Executive Committee will conduct a census to find out 
how many members the party actually has. 
  In his covert battle against the political godfather who 
sent 
him to Bandeirantes Palace, Fleury has been setting up his own 
system for winning political prestige in the interior of the 
state. That is why he replaced Claudio Alvarenga with Michel 
Temer in the Secretariat of Government, with a promise to open 
doors of his office to fellow sympathizers. 
  Fleury swears he is not a candidate for Planalto Palace, but 
he has been putting together alliances that might ensure support 
for his name at the party convention. Last Thursday, he had 
dinner in Belo Horizonte with Minas Gerais Governor Helio 
Garcia, whom he is trying to lure into the PMDB. 
<H5>  [Boxed story bottom of p 4 by Carlota Araujo] </H5>
<H5>  Rio de Janeiro: Nelson and Moreira, the Spoils Divided </H5>
  Fragmented, with three of its bosses swapping barbs, the 
PMDB 
in Rio is corroded by impasse on the eve of an extremely 
important election year. Senator Nelson Carneiro's group says 
that the PMDB, now controlled by former Governor Moreira Franco, 
is bankrupt. Allies of the former government retort that the 
senator is leaving the party for "electioneering" reasons. Both 
factions accuse Rio Mayor Cesar Maia of being an opportunist. 
Behind the division is the big question: with an eye to the 1994 
elections, when posts at all levels will be at stake, they are 
fighting to see who will negotiate in Rio in the name of the 
party. 
  Nelson's group, which withdraws officially from the PMDB 
tomorrow, said that the condominium fee on PMDB headquarters has 
not been paid for two months. They also accuse the present 
Executive Committee of racking up court suits for its 
noncompliance with labor law. The senator insists he is leaving 
because Moreira's group has monopolized the Executive Committee. 
  Supporters of the former governor refute the accusations. 
The 
party's current secretary general in Rio, Carlos Alberto Muniz, 
said that the PMDB has no debts, that Moreira offered Nelson 
every chance, but that he refused because he already had his 
eyes on the PP [Progressive Party]. Moreira notes that any 
agreement in connection with the governorship of Rio will be 
subordinate to whatever alliances are formed for the 
presidential elections. He insists he wants to run for a seat in 
the Chamber, but Muniz does not rule out the possibility that 
Moreira may become a candidate for governor of Rio. Meanwhile, 
Moreira has been talking informally with the PSDB candidate, 
Marcello Alencar. The former mayor has in his favor a large 
portion of the 3.8 million votes in the city of Rio, but needs 
help from the PMDB organization in the interior of the state. 
<H5>  [Boxed story bottom of p 4 by Roselena Nicolau] </H5>
<H5>  Minas Gerais: Succession Will Be Clash of Opposing Forces </H5>
  Even though it is the largest party in the state, the best 
organized, and the one with the largest delegation in the state 
legislature, the PMDB in Minas is a party without a face. This 
is demonstrated by the internal disputes for the state 
governorship. There are three candidates: federal Deputy 
Tarcisio Delgado, party leader in the Chamber of Deputies; 
former Governor Newton Cardoso; and the president of the Minas 
Federation of Industries, Jose Alencar. 
  Tarcisio, who is from the "authentic" group, insists he will 
win the convention, scheduled for May, and the elections as 
well, despite the damage that the Budget CPI has done to the 
PMDB. He said that, on the contrary, "it gave the grass roots an 
incentive" to react after the CPI was installed. 
  Tarcisio says that the transformation in Minas Gerais goes 
back to the beginning of 1993 when the top party leadership was 
replaced and "members of the vanguard" took over. The deputy, 
who is a member of the regional leadership body, urges an 
approach to the PSDB and acknowledges that his running mate will 
be former Belo Horizonte Mayor Eduardo Azeredo. 
  Another candidate with a long history in the PMDB, former 
Governor Newton Cardoso, ranks second in the polls for the 
governorship--the polls in which Tarcisio's name does not 
appear. Cardoso's administration was plagued by charges of 
corruption. Rejected in the state capital, he is strong in the 
interior of the state. 
  As the "dark horse" of the PMDB, businessman Jose Alencar is 
betting on "administrative competence and moral authority" to 
help him win the battle at the convention. Alencar has never 
been a politician and will exploit this fact to some extent in 
his campaign. "I do not need politics," says he, who owns 10 
companies. 
<H5>  [Boxed story bottom of p 4 by Jose Mitchell] </H5>
<H5>  Rio Grande do Sul: Federal Congressmen and Britto the Stars </H5>
  Given the positive national image of almost all its federal 
legislators, and boasting the best regional party structure, the 
Rio Grande do Sul PMDB is not suffering much from the negative 
repercussions of the Budget CPI. On the contrary, former 
Minister and Federal Deputy Antonio Britto leads all the polls 
for the gaucho governorship; some surveys show he has 
twice or three times as many votes as the other candidates. 
  The Rio Grande do Sul congressional delegation, part of the 
PMDB's so-called Ethical Movement, also distinguishes itself in 
other areas: Deputy Nelson Jobim is the rapporteur for the 
constitutional revision and Pedro Simon, the principal leader in 
the state, is the government's leader in the Senate and the most 
influential political advisor to President Itamar Franco. 
  The only exception concerns the heretofore highly respected 
former speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Ibsen Pinheiro. Oddly 
enough, by opting at the time to be speaker of the Chamber 
instead of running for mayor of Porto Alegre, Ibsen was one of 
those responsible for the defeat of the party: after his refusal 
and that of three other potential candidates, State Deputy Cesar 
Schirmer lost the mayoral race to the PT candidate, Tarso Genro. 
  The gaucho PMDB is trying to recover from 
successive electoral losses--for the governorship in 1990, and 
the last two elections for mayor of Porto Alegre. The state 
capital is the main problem for the gaucho PMDB, 
since the PDT heads the city council, the legislative assembly, 
and the state governorship, while the PT holds City Hall. In 
compensation, the PMDB is well organized in the 427 
municipalities and ranks first in the number of mayors (160), 
vice mayors (145), and aldermen (1,286).

<F P=106> [Interview with Chilean President-Elect Eduardo Frei by </F>
Maria Ines Bussi; place and date not given: "`I will Stamp out 
Chile's Poverty'"--first two paragraphs are CORRIERE DELLA SERA 
introduction] 
  [Text] Maria Ines Bussi, the granddaughter of former 
Chilean President Allende, killed in 1973 in the Moneta Palace 
besieged and bombarded by Pinochet's soldiers, interviewed 
Chile's new President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, son of Eduardo 
Frei Montalva, head of state in the 1960's. 
  Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, age 51, a Christian Democrat, was 
elected as head of the Chilean Republic on 11 December 1993, and 
will take office on 11 March. He is a civil engineer, and has 
worked for 20 years in private companies. Frei is linked to 
Italy through his study and work experience, having lived in 
Milan between 1967 and 1969. He worked on the construction of 
the "Autostrada dei Fiori" freeway and then at ENI [National 
Hydrocarbons Corporation] under a study grant. Frei represents, 
compared with outgoing President Aylwin, a change of generation 
in politics in Chile, a country which has returned to democracy, 
but over which the shadow of former dictator Pinochet still 
hangs. 
  [Bussi] President Frei, what are the main points of your 
government plan to broaden and strengthen Chilean democracy? 
  [Frei] In recent years Chile has successfully laid the 
foundations for making growth and economic development 
compatible with a framework of justice and equity. It is said 
that developing countries first of all have to put their own 
economies in order and then concern themselves with their poor 
and marginalized populations. Thanks to the efforts that we 
have made in recent years, it is now possible to combat 
marginalization and extreme poverty without prejudicing economic 
development. One priority of my program is eliminating the 
poverty which today affects some 10 percent of the population. 
I believe that the country is in a position to do this. 
  This means building a democracy on the bases of 
participation 
and solidarity, with particular emphasis on areas such as 
education, health, housing, and the environment. It also 
requires modernizing the state, and transferring power 
progressively to civilian society, a process which is identified 
with decentralization and regionalization. I would also like to 
ensure the integration of young people and women, offering them 
greater opportunities. For the first time, Chile has three 
women in government. 
  [Bussi] How can one reconcile the private capitalism which 
has prevailed until now and the economics of solidarity which 
you are proposing? 
  [Frei] In Chile, more than 75 percent of investment and 
production is carried out by the private sector. We have 
clearly stated that it is not the state's role to occupy the 
productive sector. The state's job, rather, is to concern 
itself with the good of the country. What is of concern to us 
is that public enterprises be efficient and productive. 
Obviously, unproductive companies will be privatized. 
  [Bussi] President Frei, why ever did you appoint the 
Socialist German Correa to the head of a key ministry like that 
of the interior? 
  [Frei] Chile's Government is a political coalition. It is 
the broadest alliance ever in our political history. It is this 
coalition which has allowed us to have a durable government, 
able to guarantee continuity to economic players. In this team 
there are the more important parties like the Socialist Party 
(PS), the Party for Democracy (PPD), the Christian Democratic 
Party (PDC) -- the main party -- and the Radical Party (PR), and 
smaller parties like the Social Democratic Party (PSD), the 
Center Alliance Party (PAC), and the Democratic Party of the 
Left (PDS). 
  In a presidential system like ours, appointments are made by 
the president of the Republic, and I have always stated, 
starting in the electoral campaign, which selection criteria I 
would use for the appointments within my power: criteria of 
effectiveness and of respecting the political balances which the 
coalition represents, as is done in every democracy the world 
over. The Socialist Party merited a key post and German Correa 
offered all the human and professional qualities to make a good 
success of the job. 
  [Bussi] Recently, the discovery of cases of corruption in 
the 
military government has created a scandal. Public companies 
were sold to members of government at prices which can today be 
said to be favorable. Court proceedings are still under way. 
What guarantees do you believe you can give in the case of new 
privatizations? 
  [Frei] In Chile there is a tradition of probity in the 
public service. This is an historical constant and I insisted 
greatly in the election campaign on the fact that I wanted to 
give an important ethical-moral content to the management of the 
public administration. All the appointments which I will make 
and which I have made take this commitment into consideration. 
If a company is in future to be privatized, this will be done 
with total transparency, so that the country knows how things 
are going. 
  [Bussi] There are still some accounts to be settled with the 
past. What is the situation of the political prisoners whom you 
will find when you take up the presidency of the Republic? 
  [Frei] At the time President Aylwin took office, there were 
400 to 500 political detainees. Today no more than 20. For me 
the problem is obviously much simpler. And I will face it. 
  [Bussi] The problem of internal security appears to be 
taking 
an increasingly important central place in political debate? Is 
a reform of the police forces planned? 
  [Frei] Chile's police is made up of the "Carabineros" and 
the 
"Investigaciones," which report to the minister of defense. I 
am considering changing this situation, and the extent to which 
responsibility for public order can be attributed to the 
Ministry of the Interior and he be given authority to govern the 
police forces. This residue of our past military regime ought 
also to disappear. 
  [Bussi] During the dictatorship, many Chileans went into 
exile. Are you thinking of giving incentives for the return of 
those who left for political or economic reasons and to 
reintegrate them into the workforce? 
  [Frei] During President Aylwin's government various laws, 
such as the "Return Law," were passed with a view to 
reintegrating persons abroad, along with a series of legislative 
provisions and facilities for their reintegration. But the true 
disaster for so many Chilean citizens who escaped abroad is 
economic growth, the development of a solid democratic system, 
and new jobs.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 22 Jan (PL) -- Hundreds of 
demonstrators in the Colombian cities of Medellin and Santa Fe 
de Bogota burned U.S. flags to protest the presence of U.S. 
military personnel in this country, local media reported today. 
  In Medellin, capital of Antioquia Department, northwest of 
here, and Santa Fe de Bogota these actions occurred for the 
second time in a little less than one week, carried out by 
members of student and youth organizations, the sources added. 
  The first contingent of U.S. military troops arrived on the 
Colombian Pacific Coast late in December with the announced 
purpose of building a school and hospital in that region. 
  There are currently some 259 U.S. troops, who must leave 
Colombia in three months, although journalistic circles speak of 
a possible extension of their stay.

  [Text] Harare, 15 Jan (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina received here today a friendly welcome from 
Stansilus Chigwedere, permanent secretary of the Foreign 
Ministry, who underscored the common interests of the two 
countries. 
  We welcome, Chigwedere said at the air terminal, someone who 
represents a state that has shown its solidarity with Zimbabwe 
since its struggle for independence and with which we share many 
positions. 
  The high-ranking official spoke on behalf of Foreign 
Minister 
Nathan Shamuyarira, who will be abroad until tomorrow. 
  Robaina described as a privilege the visit of the delegation 
he is heading, because it affords the opportunity of a direct 
contact with something that is part of our African history and 
traditions. 
  "We aspire to know each other better, to explain how my 
people live and work, and to exchange mutually beneficial 
experiences," he stated. 
  The Cuban minister will complete a three-day visit during 
the 
third leg of an area tour which started in Ghana and Angola and 
will continue in Zambia and Namibia. 
  The welcoming ceremony was attended by Cuban Ambassador 
Designate Pedro Nunez Mosquera and Charge d'affaires Marcos 
Rodriguez Costa, among other officials.

<F P=106> [Report by Eduardo Rodriguez-Baz and Ruben G. Abelenda] </F>
  [Text] Luanda, 16 Jan (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina said during an interview in Luanda with PRENSA 
LATINA: "I am the foreign minister of a people to whom I am 
strongly committed and of whom I want to be just another member." 
  Before leaving Angola, where he spent 48 hours doing intense 
diplomatic work and his few free moments walking the streets and 
speaking with fellow Cubans working in that country, Robaina 
agreed to talk with PRENSA LATINA reporters. 
  Robaina stressed that he does not want to be different from 
the foreign ministers of other states or to create a different 
image for himself since he has never studied how his 
counterparts behave. 
  "I do not think a foreign minister's life should be strictly 
protocol-oriented. I follow certain established rules of 
diplomacy, but I am always aware of my responsibility to 
represent Cubans at home and abroad." 
  Robaina said he rejects the idea of becoming a foreign 
minister for the outside. "I want to be foreign minister in my 
country, too," he said. 
  Robaina also noted that his work ties him to the Cuban 
people's history, and his desire to be a part of that people is 
a priority. Otherwise, he insisted, I could distance myself from 
them, and that would be a personal failure. 
  In his usual affable manner, the foreign minister said that 
diplomacy in the new world situation is somewhat complicated, 
but even more difficult are the problems and tasks confronted on 
a daily basis by his countrymen, who are now being subjected to 
a commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States. 
  In terms of personal satisfaction, Robaina said his first 
choice is the opportunity to explain throughout the world what 
Cubans are doing to resist the effects of the U.S. embargo, 
"although I am afraid that words cannot express all that is 
being done in our country," he said. 
  In Angola, he went on, I have confirmed that there is a 
great 
deal of admiration and respect for the efforts Cuba is making to 
defend the plan and the path that we have chosen, which gave me 
special satisfaction during this leg of my African tour. 
  "It is positive for the Angolan people to admire the 
achievements of the Caribbean island, but it is also very 
encouraging to know how much solidarity there is in the world 
for the Cuban cause," he explained. 
  Robaina said that there are extraordinary ties of friendship 
between Angola and Cuba, sealed with the lives of many sons of 
Cuba. 
  The foreign minister also alluded to those traditional ties 
as an accurate explanation for why the Cuban Foreign Ministry's 
diplomatic offensive in Africa "to explain our problems, what we 
are doing and how we will deal with the future," is so 
noticeable in Angola. 
  In response to a question about the time he spent as an 
international soldier in Angola, Robaina said his visit as 
foreign minister has allowed him to relive the time "when I 
attended the best school, the school of life; when I lived with 
Cubans and Angolans in difficult conditions that were quite 
different from the current situation." 
  Robaina said that during his stay in Luanda, both sides 
emphasized those very profound historic and mutual ties between 
the two peoples and governments. 
  "The only thing that has changed," he insisted, "is the way 
we must cooperate, a situation prompted by the current 
international situation." 
  Concerning Cuba's foreign policy, Robaina said that Cuba is 
willing to establish some level of relations with all nations, 
including the United States and South Africa, as long as basic 
mutual principles are respected. 
  In reference to the southernmost country in Africa, he said: 
"We Cubans begin with the premise of not getting ahead of 
events." 
  It is necessary now to follow closely the evolution of the 
political process faced by South Africans, which is being 
observed by this continent and the rest of the world, including 
Cuba, he said. 
  Robaina added that in due time his government will consider 
establishing diplomatic relations with Pretoria. In this regard 
he said some progress has already been made: "The Cuban people 
know a little about South Africans, and vice versa, because we 
encountered each other at a negotiating table to resolve 
stability in southern Africa." 
  Angola was the second stop on the Cuban foreign minister's 
first tour of this region. Robaina first visited Ghana, then 
continued his tour in Zimbabwe. His agenda includes stays in 
Zambia and Namibia.

  [Text] Harare, 17 Jan (PL) -- Today in this capital city, 
Cuban Foreign Relations Minister Roberto Robaina delivered a 
message from Cuban President Fidel Castro to Zimbabwe President 
Robert Mugabe. 
  The message was received by Simon Muzenda, acting president 
of this south African nation, who met briefly with the Cuban 
foreign minister at Zimbabwe's presidency. 
  With this meeting Robaina begins his third and last day in 
Harare, where he arrived Saturday on an official visit after 
visiting Angola. This is all part of a two week official tour 
through the African continent. 
  The head of Cuban diplomacy will be going to Lusaka 
tomorrow, 
the capital city of Zambia, and later on to Namibia, the last 
leg of a tour that also included Ghana and Angola.

<F P=106> [Report by Hugo Rius] </F>
  [Text] Harare, 18 Jan (PL) -- Shortly before concluding his 
official three-day visit to Zimbabwe, Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina stated today in this city that "we are leaving 
Zimbabwe with more reasons than ever to feel like a part of 
Africa." 
  In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Robaina said that during the 
short time he was here, he felt as if he had returned to Cuba's 
cultural roots, in a fertile setting which would encourage to 
flourish further the historical links of brotherhood. 
  At the airport terminal, Robaina was seen-off by his 
Zimbabwean counterpart, Nathan Shamuyarira, with whom he met on 
three occasions during the third and last day of his official 
visit. 
  Their first meeting was for official talks, later for a 
reception honoring the 35th anniversary of the Cuban revolution, 
where both foreign ministers gave their respective speeches, and 
finally for a dinner reception. 
  According to Robaina, on each occasion they both coincided 
on 
the international political situation and the willingness to 
develop bilateral relations. 
  Shamuyarira told PRENSA LATINA that not just Zimbabwe but 
all 
of Africa was indebted to Cuba, a comment he repeated during 
festivities commemorating the Cuban national holiday and 
explained further today by making concrete propositions. 
  "Now it is up to us to support Cuba in its struggle against 
the U.S. blockade and plans by the great powers to isolate it, 
not only in the international organizations but in any other 
possible sphere," he said. 
  He said one significant way to do so is by encouraging 
mutual 
trade--especially with those countries on the Atlantic part of 
Africa that have more resources, for example, such as crude 
oil--and by being more able to offer sea and air transportation 
services. 
  After embracing at the foot of the aircraft which 
transported 
Robaina to Lusaka, Zambia, for the last stretch of a trip 
through Africa, which will conclude in Namibia, the Zimbabwean 
foreign minister said he shares the Cuban minister's 
satisfaction with the meeting. 
  During an intense agenda, the Cuban visitor also held 
meetings with the ministers of higher education and health, the 
trade and industry deputy minister, the ministers of the 
interior, agriculture and information, and the mayor of Harare, 
who also participated in the reception commemorating the Cuban 
revolution. 
  Likewise, Robaina also met with several Cubans who work and 
live in this African country as well as with the board of 
directors of the Zimbabwe-Cuba Friendship Association. 
  Undoubtedly, Robaina was able to explain that his country is 
working with tremendous difficulty, but with an unflinching 
spirit to preserve its independence and social accomplishments.

<F P=106> [Report by special reporter Eduardo Rodriguez-Baz] </F>
  [Text] Windhoek, 20 Jan (PL) -- Today, Cuban Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina denied media reports noting that his 
country would send troops to Angola if it detects foreign 
intervention there. In exclusive statements to PRENSA LATINA, 
Robaina described these reports as clumsy, ill-intended 
maneuvers. 
  Cuba fully respects the negotiations that are under way 
between the Angolan Government and National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola in Lusaka, Zambia, in the search for a 
peaceful solution to the Angolan conflict, Robaina emphasized. 
  The Cuban delegation is very much aware of the absurd nature 
of this maneuver. The issue was discussed from the beginning, 
and our position of nonintervention was clearly established. Our 
stand, however, is being distorted precisely at the place where 
the talks are being held. 
  The foreign minister noted the fact that the topic was 
discussed with the Angolans themselves, and the fact that Havana 
clearly established its position of nonintervention in their 
internal affairs should attract the attention of many people. 
  Cuba maintains full respect for the inter-Angolan dialogue 
and this position was even stated to President Jose Eduardo Dos 
Santos, he concluded. 
  Robaina began a two-week tour that included Ghana, Angola, 
Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Namibia on 9 January.

  [Text] Windhoek, 21 Jan (PL) -- The Cuban and Namibian 
Governments signed today in this capital an important commercial 
agreement granting each other most favored nation status. 
  The document, which will be valid for three years, was 
signed 
by Cuban Foreign Relations Minister Roberto Robaina and Hidipo 
Hamutenya, Namibian trade and industry minister. 
  According to the agreement, the contracting parties will 
make 
all payments in freely convertible currency and in accordance 
with the laws of both states. 
  However, the signatories may adopt other forms of payment to 
promote the rapid development of commercial ties, the document 
said. 
  Robaina and Hamutenya agreed that this bilateral accord will 
create new ways to identify other areas of cooperation. 
  The Havana and Windhoek Foreign Ministries last Wednesday 
signed another agreement to eliminate visa requirements for the 
citizens of both nations. 
  Robaina today concludes a three-day visit to Namibia, the 
last leg of a two-week tour of Africa, which also took him to 
Ghana, Angola, Zimbabwe, and Zambia. 
  Before leaving for his country, the Cuban foreign relations 
minister will speak to Namibian President Sam Nujoma, to whom he 
will present a message from President Fidel Castro.

<F P=106> [Article by Nancy Zamora] </F>
  [Text] Madrid, 14 Jan (PL) Isabel Allende, Cuban vice 
minister of foreign relations, said today bilateral relations 
between Spain and Cuba are good and constructive. 
  Allende, who is on an official visit to Spain, said the two 
countries have different points of view on certain issues. She 
told PRENSA LATINA that "the important thing is, however, the 
attitude one takes to solve problems and overcome difficulties." 
  During her stay in Madrid, the deputy foreign minister held 
meetings with high-ranking officials from the Spanish Foreign 
Ministry, with whom she discussed issues such as progress at the 
bilateral commissions on scientific and cultural exchange and 
technical and industrial assistance. 
  Regarding an upcoming trip by Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina, following an invitation from his Spanish colleague, 
Javier Solana, Allende said the visit will serve to develop 
further the ties with Spain, one of the Caribbean island's main 
commercial partners. 
  Allende said "we are working to strengthen our ties, and 
there is nothing keeping us from doing so, based on, of course, 
the principles of mutual respect and noninterference." 
  The diplomat addressed the importance the local press had 
given her visit to the Iberian nation, which she sees as proof 
of the interest there is in her country. She regretted, 
however, the appearance of information she termed manipulative 
in certain newspapers which she considers prestigious. 
  To illustrate her statement, she mentioned an article 
published yesterday in an EL PAIS issue. The article reported a 
meeting she held with a high-ranking Foreign Ministry official, 
during which they discussed Spanish claims for the release of 
several people imprisoned in Cuba. 
  Allende said "I am concerned that they highlighted [words 
indistinct] minimal time and attention, which by no means 
constitutes the essence of Spanish-Cuban relations." 
  She also criticized a report carried yesterday in the Madrid 
daily EL MUNDO that listed recommendations Economy Minister 
Carlos Solchaga allegedly made to the Cuban Government upon 
returning from a trip to the Caribbean nation last year. 
  The Spanish Foreign Ministry flatly denied the reports 
today, 
stating that the newspaper's article "seriously twisted the 
content and meaning of the original document." 
  According to EL MUNDO, Solchaga presented a "secret 
document" 
to authorities in Havana in which Spain listed several 
recommendations for an economic solution to the island's 
economic crisis. 
  In commenting on the possible economic formulas, Solchaga 
said "Cuba receives visitors [word indistinct] recommendations 
regarding measures to overcome the current economic crisis, but 
it is the government--as the most interested party in resolving 
the crisis--who must decide on which measures to adopt." 
  In answering a question from reporters during a news 
conference in Madrid, Allende said the U.S. blockade against 
Cuba is illegal. She added it violates international laws and 
contradicts basic premises of a market economy, which depends on 
the ability to trade, to establish a business and to navigate 
freely. 
  She also admitted that since the beginning of Bill Clinton's 
administration, Washington is using less aggressive language 
toward the island but void of any indication of a change in U.S. 
policy.

  [Text] Madrid, 21 Jan (PL) -- Isabel Allende, Cuban vice 
foreign minister, ended today a two-week visit to Spain, which 
has been considered productive. 
  The vice minister began her visit on 11 January in Madrid 
and 
afterward traveled to Barcelona, Seville, and Las Palmas, where 
she met with local authorities and associations of friendship 
with Cuba. 
  In Madrid she met with high-ranking Foreign Affairs Ministry 
(MAE) officials, with whom she discussed topics of bilateral 
interest, in a constructive and sincere climate, Allende told 
PRENSA LATINA. 
  During this meeting with MAE, the work with the 
Spanish-Cuban 
assistance commissions was reviewed, covering industries, 
science, technology, and cultural sectors, as well as the 
preparations for the upcoming visit to Spain by Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina. 
  The Cuban diplomat described the Spanish authorities' 
welcome 
as positive, during her tour of the capitals of Cataluna, 
Andalusia, and the Canary Islands, where she analyzed relations 
between these areas and Cuba. 
  Allende especially underscored the increasing solidarity 
toward Cuba by the Spanish people, demonstrated in repeated 
expressions of support during her stay. 
  In this connection she stressed the specific plans of 
numerous friendship associations and platforms against the U.S. 
blockade, aimed at collecting and forwarding various resources 
to Cuba.

  [Text] Havana, 16 Jan (PL) -- The Cuban weekly newspaper 
JUVENTUD REBELDE published an article today stating that even 
though the United States fails to grant more than half of the 
20,000 yearly visas agreed to in 1984, the U.S. media always 
blame Cuba for illegal departures. 
  More than 60 percent of the visa applications rejected by 
the 
U.S. Interests Section in Havana are submitted by youths, who 
also make up the majority of illegal departures from Cuba, the 
newspaper states. 
  Because of this, the newspaper adds, the only option left is 
to risk their lives crossing the sea in fragile crafts to reach 
the United States and then be accepted without hesitation, as 
opposed to the treatment Haitians, Mexicans, or Chinese receive. 
  Under the title "U.S. Visa: Preferably Dead," the newspaper 
makes an analysis of Cuban migration to the United States from 
the last century to the present and highlights some of the main 
causes, such as economic crises, wars, and the resulting family 
reunifications. 
  According to Rafael Hernandez, a political analyst and 
university professor, quoted by JUVENTUD REBELDE, "the largest 
migratory wave -- more than 250,000 people -- left Cuba between 
1965-1973, during the years with the greatest economic 
difficulty and their main motivation was generalized shortages." 
  Something similar, the newspaper adds, is happening lately, 
although Cuban immigrants find themselves forced to state that 
they "go in search of liberty" or are "fleeing a totalitarian 
regime." 
  As far as Cuban diplomat Ariel Ricardo is concerned, the 
situation of his fellow citizens has an ideological connotation 
that makes them different from Haitians, Mexicans, or other 
Latin immigrants and added that the idea is to try to show that 
they "are fleeing from the Castro-communist dictatorship," which 
is not true in most cases. 
  Ricardo stated that one example is trumpet player Arturo 
Sandoval, who when replying to the question whether he would 
return to Cuba if communism was overthrown, said: "You are 
silly. Do you think I want to live in a Third World country?" 
  JUVENTUD REBELDE disclosed that the U.S. intention of giving 
a political tint to all immigration from Cuba was recently 
questioned by Manolo Salgado, a reporter for the U.S. newspaper 
EL NUEVO HERALD. 
  "Our Cuban brothers do not expect or demand that we take 
from 
here the redeeming torch of liberty. They are satisfied with 
food, medicines, clothing, shoes, and what is most important at 
this moment: dollars," Salgado stated, according to JUVENTUD 
REBELDE.

  [Text] Havana, 17 Jan (PL) -- The weekly TRABAJADORES 
affirmed today that life iteself makes readjustments necessary, 
but, it adds, we will make them the socialist way, the Cuban 
way. The weekly also reported the possibility of an economic 
recovery in the country in 1994. 
  In an editorial dedicated to what it calls "parliaments in 
the workplace" (general assemblies dedicated to discussing 
current economic difficulties and their eventual solutions), the 
official mouthpiece of the Central Organization of Cuban Trade 
Unions [CTC] notes that usually during debates workers note that 
it is necessary for each organization to adopt its own measures 
in the search for efficiency. 
  The weekly adds: We have no other reasonable road but to 
reduce costs, to increase labor productivity, and to get as much 
as possible from the available resources. The weekly warns that 
a high degree of labor discipline is a matter of attitude, 
awareness of social duties, and patriotism. 
  TRABAJADORES reports that economic policy proposals unleash 
real or imaginary conflicts of interests and contrary opinions. 
In illustrating this assertion, the weekly notes that 
suggestions for higher prices prompt concern for people who live 
on relatively low salaries. 
  The weekly adds: If somebody speaks in favor of subsidizing 
low-income people but not the goods now being sold at prices 
below production costs, some people will point to how complex 
this kind of compensatory mechanism is. 
  The weekly notes that one of the main concerns of the 
workers 
is crime, its relationship with the black market, and the effect 
this has on social and labor discipline. 
  The weekly wonders about an eventual solution and then 
states 
that people at all levels demand that drastic and examplary 
measures be applied to resolve the problems of theft and the 
diversion of goods, which increases costs, demoralizes the 
community, and makes rich the so-called "macetas" (traffickers, 
speculators, etc.). 
  The weekly links all this to the need for strict compliance 
with financial norms. It also mentions the need to modify the 
tax system, possibly expanding it. 
  The weekly reports: Signs of economic recovery in some 
production sectors and activities are expected in 1994, and this 
includes rationalizing finances based on an lofty political 
consensus. 
  TRABAJADORES reports that the Cuban people are moving onto a 
more offensive phase in key aspects of the struggle to safeguard 
the fatherland's sovereignty and the socialist nature of the 
revolution. 
  The weekly admits that the complexity of the problems shows 
how naive it would be to expect magic-like measures. It goes on 
to discard "packages" that "smell too much like Third-World 
capitalism and neoliberal policies," which would prompt higher 
prices, unemployment, and the elimination of social services. 
  We are in urgent need of improving our economic efficiency, 
but we must not run full speed ahead to secure technical 
objectives without first considering political effects, the 
weekly states. 
  TRABAJADORES calls for not allowing the slightiest 
indication 
of ritualism or formalism in the parliaments in the workplace, 
and it states that it is essential that managers throughout the 
country clearly report the economic and financial outlook of 
each workplace.

  [Text] Havana, 24 Jan (PL) -- The TRABAJADORES weekly, 
official organ of the Cuban Workers Federation (CTC), in today's 
edition urges an objective analysis of the problems in each 
center, instead of extrapolating attention to the national 
problems. 
  The current financial imbalances must be solved by acting on 
the offer-demand principle, states an editorial in the weekly 
paper which also points out the need for eliminating its causes. 
  The Cuban economy is burdened by an excess of circulating 
currency of approximately 10 billion pesos (the same amount of 
dollars as per the official exchange rate) and annual subsidies 
in excess of 4 billion pesos to profitless enterprises, 
according to official data. 
  Since a few weeks ago, and after the last convocation of the 
National Assembly of the People's Government (parliament), the 
CTC called on its affiliates to analyze the internal causes of 
the economic crisis in the country and propose measures to 
reverse it. 
  The editorial points out that at the first such meetings 
there has been a tendency in some work centers to "think little 
about the problems, weaknesses, and errors that undermine their 
own daily work." 
  In this regard it proposes that the administrations present 
to those assemblies an economic analysis of their management and 
proposals for improving them, drafted by the main administrative 
official of each unit and in understandable terms. 
  After admitting that there are production plans which are 
"tainted by paternalism" which include "large components of the 
inefficiency (...) we mean to fight," the editorial expresses 
the need to reduce the costs of production and create, in places 
where it does not yet exist, an instrument for determining them.

  [Text] Havana, 13 Jan (PL) -- Cuba sees chances for 
economic recovery based on efficiency. Carlos Lage, a member of 
the Politburo of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC), today said 
the current sugar harvest, as well as the upcoming sugar 
harvest, will be decisive in attaining that goal. 
  During a meeting with leaders of the sugar industry in 
central Ciego De Avila Province, Lage said the 1994-95 harvest 
must be greater than the current one. He stressed that the 
recovery of the country's main industry is a precondition to 
overcoming the current period of economic crisis. 
  Cuba is experiencing a period of severe economic difficulty, 
following the disbanding of the European socialist bloc, with 
which it conducted 85 percent of its foreign trade, and the 
increased U.S. trade, financial, and commercial embargo against 
the island. 
  Lage, who is credited with being the strategist of Cuban 
economic policy, underscored the importance of the current sugar 
harvest, saying that it will provide the resources needed for 
next year's harvest, which could mark the beginning of the 
country's economic recovery. 
  According to a report by the National Information Agency, 
the 
vice president of the Council of Ministers said no one must stop 
work now to process a single ton of sugar or sow a single 
caballeria (11.42 hectares) of cane sprouts. 
  Lage pointed out that life has demonstrated that the country 
can complete a harvest with less resources than before, during 
this special period, as the Cubans call the strategy they have 
developed to overcome the economic difficulties. 
  Nelson Torres, the minister of the sugar industry; Alfredo 
Hondal, a member of the Politburo and first secretary of the PCC 
in Ciego de Avila; and the directors of the agroindustrial 
complexes were present at the meeting, during which they 
discussed production strategies for the current sugar harvest. 
  The participants agreed that maximum use of all available 
resources, railroads, and sugar cane for processing are 
essential to an efficient campaign.

  [Text] Havana, 14 Jan (PL) -- Carlos Lage Davila, secretary 
of the Council of Ministers Executive Committee, stated today 
that Cuba has the potential to accomplish a slow economic 
recovery despite the current severe limitations in resources. 
  Even though 1994 will be very difficult, very trying, we 
trust that certain activities will improve during the year, 
added Lage--who is also a member of the Communist Party of Cuba 
Political Bureau--in statements to the national television news. 
  He said the availability of resources is directly related to 
the 1992-1993 sugar harvest, when production was approximately 
two million metric tons less than estimated, resulting in lost 
revenues of more than $450 million. 
  He admitted, however, that the Cuban economy has a very slim 
chance of protecting itself against the negative repercussions 
resulting from external factors, such as the reinforced U.S. 
economic, financial, and commercial blockade against the island. 
  Lage's statements were made in the central eastern Province 
of Ciego de Avila, where he said the recovery of the sugar 
industry constitutes an indispensable condition to surpass the 
current Cuban economic crisis.

<F P=106> [Report by Alejandro Gomez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 12 Jan (PL) -- One of the measures 
proposed by workers to improve finances is the creation and sale 
of bonds of the fatherland, which would be purchased 
voluntarily, without interest or with a soft interest, and 
redeemable within five to 10 years. 
  Workers at a canned food factory discussed this proposal, 
along with other suggestions like paying for sports and cultural 
events, increasing electricity charges, and seizing money and 
goods that were obtained illegally. 
  The discussion at that Cuban industry is a sign of what will 
happen at all work centers in Cuba on 30 January after more than 
400,000 labor leaders conclude their analysis of these topics. 
  Despite the social cost of many proposals, most Cuban 
workers 
agree on the need to adopt a program to reorganize the country's 
finances, a program that is indispensable to apply other 
measures with a view to overcome the serious crisis that the 
nation is facing. 
  With regard to this, the government also recognized the 
urgency of making these decisions, but at the same time it 
issued a call to preserve the achievements of the Cuban 
socialist project, such as in health and education, which are 
free to all inhabitants of the island. 
  The last session of the Cuban parliament -- 27 and 28 
December -- analyzed the country's economic situation, but no 
agreements were reached because, it was learned, a process of 
consultations and explanations to the population was needed 
first. 
  Cuban experts considered that the main guidelines for a 
possible program to improve the financial situation will stem 
from the people's opinions. Such a program could be approved by 
the Cuban deputies during a special session that is to be 
convoked for that purpose. 
  According to these experts, the fact that there is a budget 
deficit of 4.2 billion pesos and that over 10 billion pesos (at 
par with the dollar at the official exchange rate) are in 
circulation demand the adoption of certain measures to control 
it. 
  This latter problem is considered one of the most harmful 
because it contributes to a drop in efficiency and productivity 
and increases a lack of labor discipline and interest. 
  But the solutions, the experts said, must include measures 
to 
improve profitability in most state enterprises because, 
according to official statistics, 69 percent of them are 
operating at a loss.

  [Text] Havana, 11 Jan (PL) -- Pedro Ross Leal, secretary 
general of the Cuban Workers Federation, said today that the 
main solutions to the crisis the Cuban economy is currently 
facing lie in production efficiency and the service sector. 
  Ross made this statement in the television program "Open 
Agenda" during which he announced over 3 million union members 
will participate in a consultation process called "the 
parliament of the labor centers." 
  He recalled that union debate on the measures the country 
should adopt to reorganize its finances and revitalize the 
economy began yesterday on an experimental basis in the western 
Province of Pinar del Rio. Numerous meetings of companies 
related to the food and fishing industries took place in Pinar 
del Rio. 
  Ross considered the debates held with workers from Pinar del 
Rio as broad, open, and fruitful. Ross said that the workers 
proposed such measures as increasing the price of electricity; 
charging a fee for sports and cultural events; and creating and 
selling national bonds recoverable within a period of five to 10 
years. 
  Ross added that there is a broad consensus regarding the 
need 
to seek ways to recover the money illegally obtained by Cubans 
who are locally called "macetas" [profiteers]. He emphasized 
that these "macetas" have built their fortunes by exploiting the 
needs of others. 
  Ross confirmed that the consultation process will include in 
its first stage (until 29 January) over 400,000 union leaders, 
and after 29 January, meetings will be conducted in all the 
country's labor centers. 
  The popular debate on the serious economic-financial 
situation was recommended last December by the National Assembly 
of the People's Government (Parliament). During the 
Parliament's regular session, it was learned that Cuba faces an 
excess of currency in circulation amounting to more than 12 
billion pesos (equivalent to dollars at the official currency 
exchange). 
  It was also learned in Parliament that 30 percent of state 
companies are unprofitable and it was estimated that the 
subsidies to just the sugar industry in the past three years 
reached 7.2 billion pesos. 
  Ross Leal's statement was preceded by the publication 
yesterday in the weekly TRABAJADORES of an editorial which urged 
the union sectors to "take part in the kneading of the bread of 
decisionmaking rather than sitting back and smelling it as it is 
baking."

  [Text] Havana, 18 Jan (PL) -- Pedro Ross, secretary general 
of the Cuban Workers Federation [CTC], affirmed during a meeting 
with workers in the western Province of Matanzas that Cuba will 
adopt measures that will benefit the country economically while 
keeping people's sacrifices as low as possible. 
  Ross said it is necessary to give a political tenor to the 
workers' assemblies initiated one week ago so that workers may 
discuss how to improve the nation's economic situation and put 
the country's domestic finances in order. 
  The island's most important labor leader said that the 
country wants to overcome the current crisis in such a way that 
it will be able to continue defending the achievements of the 
people and of socialism, the daily GRANMA reports today. 
  A similar position has been taken by Ricardo Alarcon, 
president of the Cuban Parliament. He said that this phase of 
discussions about measures to put the country's domestic 
finances in order and other key matters of the economy also 
forms part of the political battle for island development. 
  The country's authorities have promoted collective debates 
in 
search for a national consensus on the adoption of decisions 
capable of balancing a fiscal deficit of approximately 4.2 
billion pesos (the peso is equivalent to the dollar at the 
official exchange rate) and decreasing the excess 10 billion 
pesos now circulating. 
  In the assemblies that have been held the members of labor 
unions have spoken in favor of reducing subsidies on some state 
products and services, eliminating undue free services, 
increasing the prices of nonstaples, and offering social 
security only to people who really need it.

  [Text] Havana, 17 Jan (PL) -- Cuban Finance Minister Jose 
Luis Rodriguez said that the government will seek ways to 
reinforce the country's internal finances as soon as possible, 
yet in an orderly manner and after consulting with the 
population. 
  Although apparently contradictory, it is necessary to go 
slow 
but as fast as circumstances permit, Rodriguez said during a 
government meeting in Pinar del Rio Province, according to a 
National News Agency [AIN] press dispatch. 
  A fiscal deficit of 4.2 billion pesos -- the peso is on a 
par 
with the U.S. dollar -- and circulating cash in excess of 10 
billion pesos are some of the most important obstacles to a 
revival of the local economy. 
  Most of the budget deficit is comprised of subsidies. 
Agriculture, and the sugar industry alone, constituted more than 
7 billion pesos in subsidies in the past three years. Rodriguez 
said that subsidies to cover losses in managerial activities 
constitute one of the country's most serious problems. In this 
regard, he underlined the importance of increasing revenue, 
revising prices, and making other decisions that might help the 
situation, according to AIN. 
  The Cuban Workers Federation [CTC] last week began a process 
of consultations between deputies and the rank and file 
regarding measures to solve the financial situation. In the 
early meetings, the CTC members favored reducing subsidies for 
some products and state services and charging for services 
formerly given for free. In some plants, the workers even 
proposed creating a "bonus for the homeland" at very low or no 
interest. 
  Rodriguez has not yet mentioned any specific measures. He 
said that a number of urgent situations must be corrected but in 
an orderly manner and after talking with the people. He said 
that such decisions are necessary, require the people's support, 
and entail a certain degree of sacrifice. 
  The National Assembly of the People's Government, which 
debated the matter for the first time in late December, plans to 
hold a special session to discuss financial reorganization. 
Ricardo Alarcon, president of the parliament, said on Sunday 
that the debate will be held as soon as possible, although the 
date has not yet been determined.

<F P=106> [Report by Tony Gonzalez Martin] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 12 Jan (PL) -- Colombian Health Minister 
Juan Luis Londono has voiced his satisfaction with the signing 
of an initial agreement with Cuba to purchase medicine and 
services for $7 million. 
  The negotiations concluded successfully, Londono assured 
PRENSA LATINA at the end of his visit to the island, which 
lasted from 2 to 11 January. 
  Londono said the agreement signed with his Cuban 
counterpart, 
Julio Teja, could double the initial amount involved before the 
end of the first half of 1994. 
  We predict that these purchases will double or triple within 
the next two years, Londono added. 
  Although the minister gave no details, he suggested that 
such 
acquisitions of medicine and services could help Cuba pay its 
debt to Colombia, which unofficial Colombian sources estimate at 
about $45 million. 
  Londono pointed out that this form of payment would "give 
way 
to a revolution, to a debt-for-health swap, which I think would 
be a major innovation in Latin America." 
  In addition to these purchases, Londono added, we also 
reached agreements on exchange and technical assistance programs 
by which Cuban specialists will cooperate in primary care 
services, epidemiological programs, and medicine control. 
  The Colombian minister pointed out that his visit surpassed 
his expectations because the host party was more willing to 
negotiate and cooperate than he had expected. 
  Londono added that they identified a number of possible 
joint 
ventures that will create an aggressive and positive exchange 
system. 
  The minister said he hopes the ties that were established 
will prove durable and will lead Colombia to adopt the 
advantages of the Cuban health system under conditions 
applicable to that country. 
  As for the agreement that was signed, Londono emphasized 
that 
"he expects a successive link of strong trade relations in the 
health sector, as well as in the economic, industrial, and 
agricultural sectors." 
  The Colombian minister described his visit to Cuba as very 
enriching for Colombian society because he acquired detailed 
information about the operation of the local health system and 
about the things that could be useful to his country.

  [Text] Caracas, 21 Jan (PL) -- Following a discussion with 
President-elect Rafael Caldera, Gonzalo Garcia Bustillos, the 
Venezuelan ambassador in Cuba, today stressed that relations 
between Caracas and Havana are excellent and friendly. 
  In statement to journalists, Garcia Bustillos said president 
Caldera's Government is willing to maintain friendly relations 
with Cuba. 
  Garcia Bustillos also expressed his rejection of the 
economic 
blockade the United States has maintained against Cuba for three 
decades, and he said measures of this sort should not be 
implemented at this time. 
  Garcia Bustillos recalled that President-elect Caldera views 
the theory of social justice as the basis for international 
relations, and he said this theory should go into effect in 
today's international community. 
  Garcia Bustillos favored Cuba's reintegration into the OAS 
as 
part of the family comprising all of the states in the 
continent, and discussed the situation and the recent economic 
measures implemented in Cuba. 
  Garcia Bustillos said he met with President-elect Caldera to 
exchange general views regarding foreign policy.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 13 Jan (PL) -- Colombian Health 
Minister Juan Londono has made a positive evaluation of his 
visit to Cuba. He emphasized the agreements achieved and the 
prospect for greater cooperation. 
  Londono has considered as most important the opportunity he 
had for more than a week to study closely the health system, 
which has made Cuba one of the most advanced countries in that 
field in Latin America. 
  He said he signed an agreement with the Genetic Engineering 
and Biotechnology Center to supply 2.5 million doses of 
hepatitis B vaccine during the first quarter of 1994. The 
vaccine was used here last year in a program that covered the 
regions and sectors most threatened by this disease. Progress 
was also made in the negotiations to buy 200,000 doses of 
meningitis vaccine. The disease can be fatal, and Cuba is the 
only country to have developed an effective vaccine against it. 
Lodono has said it was agreed that a technical mission would 
visit Colombia during the first week of February to help design 
a broader immunization program for the next five years. 
  He also explored the possibility of Cuban cooperation to 
strengthen Colombia's epidemiologic surveillance network through 
the development of a data system and the addition of more 
control laboratories, as well as increasing its capability.

<F P=106> [Report by Martin Hacthoun] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 11 Jan (PL) -- John Savage, prime minister 
of the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, who is heading a 
mission on an official visit here, today explored the 
possibility of expanding commercial ties in Cuban agriculture 
and industry. 
  Savage was greeted by Jose Gonzalez Torres, vice minister of 
agriculture, and Marcos Portal, minister of basic industry, who 
briefed him on different aspects and propspects in their 
respective ministries. 
  Lionel Soto, vice president of the Council of Ministers, and 
Public Health Minister Julio Teja Perez also met with Savage and 
members of his retinue. 
  The visitor expressed an interest in the ongoing 
transformation of Cuban agriculture, the large state farms, and 
basic production cooperatives wherein land is turned over to 
farmworkers and peasants who are then given work tools and 
credit. 
  There are currently four forms of land property in Cuba: 
small private peasant holdings, peasant cooperatives, new basic 
production units, and state production units, which will be 
considerably reduced. 
  The state controls 70 percent of all cultivable land in the 
country. It is estimated that by the end of the transformation, 
the state will retain barely 20 percent, according to figures 
submitted by Gonzalez Torres. 
  As for the farming sector, in which the two countries 
maintain traditional ties, the visitors expressed great interest 
in obtaining Cuban fruits and fresh vegetables. They explored 
the possibility of investing capital through joint ventures, for 
which Savage estimated "there are real opportunities." 
  The Canadian visitors and Minister Portal studied Canada's 
participation in Cuban mining. Several Canadian companies are 
already participating in nickel, gold, and copper mining in 
Cuba, as well as in other fields, such as rubber production. 
  "I believe there are many opportunities that deserve to be 
exploited. Our objective precisely is to strengthen such ties 
for our mutual benefit," Savage stated. He visited the island 
with 17 representatives from Nova Scotia who want to negotiate 
with Cuba. 
  The economic reforms promoted by the Cuban Government, 
specifically opening up ties to foreign capital, have elicited 
great interest among businessmen, who hope to explore such 
possibilities, Andre Hare, trade director of Nova Scotia, told 
PRENSA LATINA. 
  "We really do not want to arrive too late and want to get 
here before others do," Hare said. 
  Savage is accompanied by businessmen on the tight agenda of 
meetings that he is holding with his island counterparts. 
  Hare noted that 35 meetings were held Monday, 55 others are 
scheduled for Tuesday, while a memorandum of agreements is being 
drafted. 
  Savage, a career physician, also visited a family doctor's 
clinic, a health clinic in the neighborhood, and was greeted at 
the Ameijeiras Brothers Modern Hospital. 
  The prime minister of Nova Scotia will be declared 
illustrious guest of honor of Havana and will be given the keys 
to the city at a ceremony on Wednesday. Before ending his 
official visit on Thursday, he will hold meetings with 
specialists in the Cuban biotechnological industry, and Nicolas 
Rodriguez, acting foreign minister, according to the agenda.

  [Text] Havana, 20 Jan (PL) -- Juan Contino, the first 
secretary of the Union of Young Communists [UJC], said today 
that the fact that 88,000 new members joined the UJC in 1993 
disproves rumors that this sector is moving away from the 
revolutionary process. 
  In an interview with PRENSA LATINA, Contino noted that the 
UJC has 550,000 members in its rank and file from a population 
of some 3.1 million youths, and this year it seeks to recruit 
over 600,000 new members. 
  Contino said that even amid the difficult economic situation 
the country is facing, there is an undeniable tendency for the 
UJC membership to grow, which continues to be a selective and 
leading organization and continues to strengthen its 
mass-drawing power. 
  Contino explained that currently the UJC seeks to reach such 
sectors as the farmers and services (particularly restaurants 
and community) due to the significance of their labor in the 
present situation. 
  Contino stated that people who say that "youths are no good" 
undoubtedly have a very limited view while he recalled that 
there are over 40,000 youths linked to sugar cane harvest 
activities, even under inadequate conditions. 
  Contino added that over 167,000 high school and university 
students volunteered to work the land for 15 days at the end of 
the past academic year, and another 100,000 volunteered to do 
the same throughout 1993. 
  It should also be taken into account that 60 percent of 
Cuban 
scientists are among the Cuban youth as well as 70 percent of 
workers in the tourism sector, which is second in generating 
convertible foreign exchange for the country. 
  Regarding workers in the tourism sector, Contino spoke 
highly 
of their initiative in the western Province of Matanzas, where 
workers donated some of the tips received to buy provisions for 
the young cane cutters who had volunteered for the sugar harvest. 
  He considered particularly impressive the response to the 
victory caravan. The victory caravan was organized by the UJC 
to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the Rebel Army's entry 
into Havana, and as Contino stressed, it conveyed a massive, 
spontaneous, and voluntary support for the revolution. 
  However, Contino, who is also a member of the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC], conceded that 
there are places where little confidence is placed on youths 
because of their alleged lack of experience. 
  Contino said that youths should be given room not because of 
their age, but because of the capacity they show. 
  He pointed out that the UJC pays greater attention to two 
age 
groups: teenagers and young people between 25 and 30 years. He 
indicated that in these two cases, the UJC tries to adapt work 
methods to achieve a more effective approach. 
  The UJC was established on 4 April 1961 as a leading youth 
organization, intended to train the future members of the ruling 
PCC.

  [Text] A group of enraged citizens in Antioquia Department 
on 15 January burned a U.S. flag in the center of Medellin to 
protest the presence of U.S. troops in Juanchaco and the eastern 
plains. 
  The protest began early in the evening when a group of at 
least 70 people went to the Colombian-American Cultural 
Institute in Medellin, chanted slogans against the Colombian and 
U.S. Governments, and burned the U.S. flag. 
  The demonstrators demanded the expulsion of U.S. soldiers 
from Colombia, considering their presence an invasion. 
  They also demanded that President Cesar Gaviria enforce 
respect for national sovereignty and that he explain the real 
reasons why a group of U.S. soldiers with sophisticated 
equipment and machinery is in Juanchaco, on the Pacific coast, 
and the eastern plains. 
  Authorities reported that after the U.S. flag was burned, 
the 
demonstration, which lasted 15 minutes, quickly broke up without 
any need for intervention by the police.

<F P=106> [Speech by Venezuelan President Ramon J. Velasquez to </F>
representatives of the Chambers of Deputies and Senate following 
the announcement of the start of a new period of Venezuelan 
National Congress regular sessions at the Sol del Peru Room of 
the Miraflores Presidential Palace in Caracas -- live] 
  [Text] Mr. Senate President and President of the National 
Congress; Mr. President of the Chamber of Deputies and Vice 
President of the National Congress; Dr. Felipe Montilla, 
president of the Senate Commission; Messrs. Senators; Dr. Pedro 
Tabata Guzman, president of the Chamber of Deputies Commission; 
Messrs. Deputies; Messrs. Ministers: 
  I would be lying if I denied the deep emotion I felt when 
listening to this morning's television debate. I saw in the 
debate that a new chapter in Venezuelan democracy was opening. 
All this time I have focused my efforts on fulfilling my duty 
to democracy, Venezuela, and the National Congress, which has 
given me enormous responsibility. 
  With his usual extraordinary voice, Dr. Felipe Montilla 
reminded me of the origin of that mandate and described the 
historic national climate of those hours. When I was sworn in I 
told my fellow members of parliament -- where I have spent most 
of my life as a politician during this democratic stage -- that 
a political storm had led me here and that at any moment the 
crisis could oust me, but my personal and political ethics would 
not be discredited. I wanted to fulfill the mandate and I 
wanted to avoid an interruption in the country's democracy, a 
process to which the country was committed. I was sure that more 
important than the painful conflict that brought us together was 
the Venezuelan willingness to live in freedom. I was also sure 
of the powers of the democratic process of perfection and 
correction. 
  A dictatorship would have been unable to face the crises 
that 
the Venezuelan democratic system faced throughout 1992-93. It 
was a series of political, military, and social factors and it 
was within a climate of exacerbation, and for many, a climate of 
defeat and disorientation. 
  However, above that atmosphere stood Venezuelan society's 
resolve, which had been tested during that process and is open 
to the admission of new political and social forces which are 
gradually appearing in an increasingly developing Venezuela. 
  Contrary to other Latin American countries, where 
traditional 
parties have attempted to close ranks and exclude the new forces 
emerging from development itself from political debate and 
democratic and legal participation, Venezuelan democracy has 
opened up this participation, allowing new challenges for the 
country to be stated from their platforms. 
  In a process currently criticized by many as frustrating, 
this democracy has accomplished that which certain people were 
determined to achieve since 1936. From exile, the founding 
leaders of the democratic process pointed out the need to have a 
school in each village, a high school in each town, and a 
university in every state capital, so that through learning we 
could change the traditional education system and, therefore, 
change the system whereby the country was ruled by a very small 
group. 
  Democracy has allowed this magnificent opening whereby each 
region designates its governor and every community its mayor. 
Democracy has gradually led to the growing participation of 
civilian society. There have been mistakes, failings, 
corruption and influence peddling, but complaints, lawsuits and 
democratic society's watchfulness have corrected those defects 
and created a critical awareness among Venezuelans in response 
to those negative attitudes. This had to be protected; the 
democratic process could not be interrupted because to do so 
would hinder Venezuelan society's end-of-century plans. 
  If my administration was hesitant and weak, it is because 
democracy is hesitant and weak. It is hesitant because to make 
a decision it must consult with all of the sectors; it is weak 
because it must accept [the will of those sectors], but its 
weakness is ironclad; it does not break. Only authoritarian 
regimes can boast a strength that translates into arbitrariness 
and the will of one person against the community. 
  When I see the accusations that have been leveled against 
Congress and against political activity in Venezuela, perhaps 
because I am a researcher of history and have participated in 
lengthy episodes, I can only look back at the political activity 
of this century to see how the political strength of congress, 
the political parties, the news media, and the opposition have 
gradually undermined the bad habits, cunning, and hindrances 
that blocked the development of Venezuelan society for almost 
two centuries. 
  This is a society on the move because it has the 
watchfulness of democracy through the parliament, through the 
constant denunciations and complaints by the media. It is 
preferable to have exaggerations than silence. 
  Venezuelan democracy is the fruit of a painful experience 
because what was attained in the end was what successive 
generations since the 19th century and until the sixties of this 
century wanted to have, to live with liberty and dignity. 
  Messrs. Senators and Deputies, you will start legislative 
sessions at a very difficult time in national life, because the 
threats facing the country are not traditional conspiracies or 
attempts to frustrate the process but problems such as the 
country's fiscal situation. 
  To fulfill the mandate of the Congress of the Special Powers 
Law, I, together with the Council of Minister and with the 
attendance of the most renown lawyers of the country, assumed 
the responsibility of promulgating the laws that the Congress 
pointed out to me, including tax laws, because it is necessary 
to say that in light of the demands of development, social 
demands, the state's commitments, the income from petroleum 
today is not capable, as it was in the recent past, of 
fulfilling those demands. Those demands are now on the 
government's table. 
  Tax collection is necessary. It will not be done through the 
taxes we promulgated with the Special Powers Law but, as one of 
the new parliament's immediate tasks, it must undertake a study 
of the fiscal paths that would allow the state to immediately 
tend to the problems, its own administrative problems as well as 
the social problems that have been pointed out; the problems 
related to the salaries and the cost of living. 
  On the other hand, it is indispensable -- I confirmed this 
need in its real dimensions -- to deal with the social problem, 
the poverty problem, because there can be no perfect political 
democracy if the wood worm of social disaster, which is created 
by poverty, is at the base of that democracy. As far as I am 
concerned, this has been an extraordinary watch tower, an 
observatory, as well as an information bureau. This is the case 
because just as I was able to establish a dialogue here with the 
political parties, I have also been able to meet with the 
economic sectors, other sectors of the population and other 
social sectors that allowed me to have a good idea of the 
Venezuelan social crisis. 
  The best way to reaffirm democracy, ensure that it can 
extend 
to the next century and ensure sustained growth is by finding 
solutions to the fiscal, social, and poverty problems in 
Venezuela. I truthfully say.... [pauses] I am aware that it is 
inappropriate to use certain words especially during addresses 
such as this one, but I am going to do it anyway because I am 
addressing persons who were my parliamentary companions for so 
many years. I want to say that I am ending my term quite 
content. I am content because I have been able to witness the 
arrival here at the Sol del Peru Room, of those legitimate 
representatives of the new political and national country that 
you represent. This means that Venezuelan democracy has been 
able to pass through a dark tunnel which opened the way to all 
sorts of sneak attacks, and every dishonest conduct imaginable 
aimed at preventing the country from progressing. 
  Your presence here on this 23 January 1994 is evidence of 
democracy's strength. Your presence here and the incorporation 
of the new political organizations, the presence of new 
parliamentarians and the parliamentary youths, is the best 
evidence of a new year. Venezuela's destiny is in your hands 
because, as has already been said by the presidents of the great 
commissions, we have arrived at a moment of understanding. I 
was telling the president-elect that when he is preparing to 
announce his programs, he should first ensure a national 
agreement. It is indispensable that we reach a national 
agreement in Venezuela. Problems are so serious and there is so 
little time, that truce and understanding are indispensable. 
  It is not a matter of distributing public posts, ministries 
or embassies. That makes no sense whatsoever. I am referring 
to an agreement about the country's fundamental problems, the 
solution of which can wait no longer. The voice of every sector 
must be heard. As legitimate representatives of the country's 
regions and opinions, the national agreement must find in each 
of you its champions and guarantors. 
  In concluding this address, I would like to deeply thank 
Senator Montilla for his generous words and offer that I will be 
able to return as always, as if it were my home. Thank you. 
Good evening.

underwrite a presidential tour of Asia. 
  "These financiers have substantal investment in Guyana and 
are known to be negotiating further investment with the 
government," the party said. It accused the government of 
"compromising their ability to best serve the interests of the 
country." 
  The opposition Working People's Alliance (WPA) and the 
Guyanese Organisation of Indigenous Peoples (GOIP) earlier said 
it was inappropriate that South Korean and Malaysian investors 
in the Barama Company Limited should underwrite part of the cost 
of President Cheddi Jagan's near month-long tour of China, 
Malaysia, Singapore and India which ended January 1. 
  At a press conference last Friday, Jagan admitted the 
financing received through Barama to augment limited public 
funds, but said he was unable to say at the time the amount of 
the funds from the Barama investors. 
  Barama officials here have referred queries about the extent 
of the financing to the government. 
  Barama, a manufacturer of plywood for export, has been 
touched by controversy over the level of concessions it received 
from the former Desmond Hoyte administration, and the impact of 
its forestry operations on the environment and on hinterland 
Amerindian communities here. 
  The Guyana Human Rights Association (GHRA) also commented, 
indirectly, on the matter in a statement Tuesday expressing 
concern that linkages with the newly-industrialised Asian 
economies opened Guyana to an "aggressive form of exploitation." 
  "It requires no great leap to imagine several powerful Asian 
conglomerates ensuring domestic legislation protects their 
interests when one, Barama Company Ltd, is so profoundly 
influencing foreign policy," the GHRA statement said. 
  Former Prime Minister Hamilton Green, at a press conference 
Wednesday, described the financing of the presidential tour as 
"unorthodox and inappropriate funding by a private group."

<F P=106> [Interview with Ruben Dario Carles, leader of the Change 94 </F>
Alliance and presidential candidate for the Nationalist Liberal 
Republican Movement, by Alvaro Alvarado in Panama City -- live] 
  [Text] [Alvarado] Viewers, this morning we have with us 
Professor Ruben Dario Carles. He heads the so-called Change 94 
Alliance. Good morning professor, thanks for being here. 
Political analysts who were here earlier today called the 
Change 94 Alliance a Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican 
Movement] alliance because you are a member of the Molirena 
party, so is Guillermo Quijano, and Tomas Herrera deep down is 
also one because he works with Mario Galindo, a Molirena member, 
in the same law offices. 
  [Carles] To describe Tomas Herrera that way shows a complete 
lack of respect. Tomas Herrera is the president of a political 
party [Agrarian Labor Movement -- MOLA] and is a distinguished 
professional with his own merits. He is a man who has fought 
all his life for liberty and democracy and began his struggle 
against the dictatorship back in 1969. My fellow citizens who 
made those assertions made a very poor political analysis. 
  [Alvarado] Prof. Carles, another very important aspect is 
the 
fact that you, according to studies made, represent the official 
sector -- you belonged to the official sector and so did 
Molirena. Many people believe that your links to Molirena do you 
harm. What do you think? 
  [Carles] Good gracious! Molirena is a party; in addition I 
have been nominated by Morena [National Renewal Movement], a 
party with much vitality, much organization, and which will be 
successful. I was also nominated by the Civic Renewal Party. 
These were the bases of my political actions; there are 
persons, however, who saw what happened yesterday and who do not 
appreciate what has been happening for several months. My base 
is the 60 percent of Panamanians who are not members of any 
political party. 
  [Alvarado] How do you describe yourself at this moment? Are 
you in opposition to the government? 
  [Carles] I am a citizen who takes action according to my own 
point of view. I proved this during the four years I was 
comptroller general. 
  [Alvarado] There are those who argue that your candidacy 
represents the country's business or oligarchic class -- the 
interests of the rich and not the interests of the poor. 
  [Carles] Look at who is making this statement! This holds 
true for those who said this.... 
  [Alvarado, interrupting] The Arnulfists, mainly. 
  [Carles] Good gracious! The Arnulfists also have very rich 
people, a big oligarchy, and some who are very rabiblanco 
[derogatory term for upper-class Panamanians]. This holds true 
for all parties so this is just an indiscreet remark by people. 
People should show more respect. Regardless of their social, 
economic, or racial condition, I have, and it gives me great 
satisfaction, friends everywhere -- in the interior, in the 
city, in farming, industry, business, and among workers. This 
is really something silly by people who should know better and 
who want to use this as a populist and senseless maneuver. I 
believe those who are carrying out that sort of campaign must by 
now be regretting this. Wait until they come and ask for help 
and I reply by asking: What is wrong with you? Are you against 
anyone who has something? That is not the way. Panamanians who 
have not stolen any money have a right to do what they please 
with it and take part in the political party of their choice -- 
businessmen, industrialists, cattle ranchers, workers, 
professional people. It seems to me a disservice to the country 
to make these insinuations. Let us measure the campaign by the 
candidate's merits and capacity and not any other way. Let us 
see what can they do and what can I do with my capacity, 
experience, and knowledge. 
  [Alvarado] Are you coming close to possible talks with 
Mireya 
Moscoso, Arnulfista Party president and presidential candidate? 
This is rumored in political circles. 
  [Carles] Look here, I think we have reached a certain point. 
We have the nomination and have broadened somewhat the base that 
allows electoral and political actions. But remember my dear 
Alvaro: I am the candidate, I am the one who is going to rule, I 
am going to be the boss, the person who has the program in his 
head and in writing is me, and that I am the person whom the 
country identifies as the person who has a possibility of 
fulfilling a program. What lies ahead are formulas that need to 
be resolved such as questions to do with candidacies and 
nominations. Regarding the presidency, I am the candidate and I 
have absolutely no attachments or commitments for political 
opportunities with anyone. I am going to choose my assistants 
among capable Panamanians, so I do not believe we should waste 
any time on this. 
  [Alvarado] Professor, something that has become very 
relevant is the president's statements on Saturday. What is 
your opinion on Endara saying that he openly supports Mrs. 
Mireya Moscoso de Gruber describing as traitors all those in his 
government, principally from Molirena, who did not support him 
[the Arnulfist ticket]? 
  [Carles] This is a free country and each person should 
politically opt for what he believes in. The president should 
by now be worried after using such strong words. Perhaps in the 
heat of the moment he said things that I, who know him well, 
know he does not feel. 
  [Alvarado] Can there be any impartiality in his words after 
he swore to respect the electoral process and not meddle in 
political affairs? 
  [Carles] People's oaths are each person's promise. I am sure 
that he went slightly overboard when he took such a direct 
participative stance. This is a problem he should admit to. He 
is going to resolve it because Guillermo Endara deep down is 
someone who is very willing to obey the law. If he scoffed at 
it at the National Theater [as heard] and has repeatedly said 
that he will preside over open elections, which I believe is the 
case, then he will have to straighten his course. Otherwise, he 
is going to have -- I know how these things are -- a disastrous 
last few months in office. Guillermo Endara has a vision of the 
future because he is aware that he cannot allow his work to 
become complicated in his last months in office. 
  [Alvarado] Prof. Carles, today an EL SIGLO newspaper 
headline 
says that the Legislative Assembly now is in the hands of 
Molirena, which in certain ways is an opposition party. 
National Assembly President Arturo Vallarino has said the 
president could be put on trial for his statements on Saturday. 
What do you think? 
  [Carles] First of all I must correct you because no single 
party controls the Legislative Assembly and the actions they can 
initiate are something they should.... [pauses] They can only 
ensure compliance of the legal aspects. This is a very delicate 
topic that needs proper consideration. I am sure that President 
Endara's attitude in the future will be to keep his promise to 
hold free and open elections, without becoming politically 
involved. It does not matter what happened recently; I hope 
that he keeps to his promise because this is one of his basic 
goals and I believe he is going to keep to it. 
  [Alvarado] Prof. Carles, what other parties are seeking to 
support your candidacy or join the alliance? 
  [Carles] I believe what we need now are agreements of 
support 
for the future. I hope that a process of adjustment will begin 
among the various groups that have formed and that these groups 
will join us or that some may transfer their attention to us. 
You will doubtless have noticed that when these youths speak 
they have great mobility, while others are not yet defined. I 
believe that between now and 8 February some will join. I will 
continue, of course, with the candidacy I have initially 
accepted by the Morena Party and the Civic Renewal Party. 
Others, I hope, will join as we go along. This will avoid 
having so many party groups, and most especially, the great 
majority of independent Panamanians will start defining 
themselves in our favor. The candidates are what is important 
in these elections and not the ticket of the political 
mechanisms that of course served to comply with the electoral 
laws. 
  [Alvarado] Prof. Carles, what will win these elections, the 
person or the party? What do people support right now? 
  [Carles] What I can see is that voters want a good president 
who makes decisions and resolves problems. This is not 
something that the parties guarantee, it is the candidates who 
guarantee this. 
  [Alvarado] You visited Chiriqui Province this weekend, what 
is the situation there? Chiriqui producers constantly complain 
about the situation. 
  [Carles] Lately I have had the opportunity to visit several 
places in the country. This weekend I promised, as a matter of 
economic policy, to fight so that the Republic of Panama can 
resolve its food problem. If a government does not contribute 
to solving the problem of food produced in the country, it is 
not doing well. I told them what has been my norm for many 
years: to reasonably protect the production of cattle and dairy 
products, rice, corn, sorghum, tomatoes, and some vegetables. 
This is an unalterable policy, but I warned that this would be 
done within reason so producers can increase their efficiency 
and ensure that prices to consumers are reasonable as well.

<F P=106> [Report by Ricardo Miranda] </F>
  [Text] "The No campaign is promoted by corrupt people and 
those who do not want us to have political peace," President 
Ramiro de Leon Carpio stated during an unscheduled news 
conference at Santa Cruz del Quiche yesterday. 
  Asked how he would react to a No victory, the president said 
he would accept the people's will and added that he would also 
obey the Constitutionality Court's resolution if an action 
against the 30 January event is put forward. If, as a 
consequence of such an action however, there are public 
disorders prior to, during, or after the event, the president 
said he would take the necessary legal and constitutional 
actions to prevent the country from falling into the crisis 
promoted by certain groups. 
  The president reported that he had ordered security 
organizations to increase measures to control terrorist actions 
such as the ones that occurred last week. "I am not willing to 
allow actions of terrorism and intimidation against the 
population, including media sources, to be repeated," he warned. 
  He emphasized that he will adopt the necessary 
constitutional 
and legal dispositions which will not affect the referendum or 
its results. "I will act according to the powers the 
Constitution grants me to counter acts of terrorism, people who 
disrupt public order, and illegal demonstrations or actions," he 
concluded.

  [Text] A redesigned light industry pavilion has been 
inaugurated at Expocuba. Light Industry Minister Eduardo 
Fernandez Boada was present at the inauguration and was 
interviewed by reporter Guillermo Bernal: 
  [Begin recording] [Bernal] The pavilion we have just 
inaugurated contains an extensive exhibit of Cuban products. 
However, I am concerned about the people's perception that, 
although the exhibit stresses production capabilities, what is 
displayed here is not available in stores nationwide. 
  [Fernandez] The goal of the exhibit is to show what Cuba is 
capable of producing, not what is produced to fill store 
shelves. To produce these items for nationwide public 
consumption, we would need not to be in a special period: We 
would have to have hundreds of millions of dollars we do not 
have. However, it is important for everyone to know that the 
Revolution has created these capabilities in Cuba. In the 
future, the preservation and even the development of this 
production capability -- I am convinced of this, whenever we 
have the possibility -- will allow us to supply these items to 
the people. We should not be depressed that we cannot have these 
things in the stores today. It would be sad to have lost our 
capability to do this, to have to import even chairs or pants. 
  [Bernal] Light industry is close to the Cuban family with 
such products as soaps, detergents, and tooth paste. What is the 
situation with these products? 
  [Fernandez] The goal is to try to allocate more to these 
than 
last year to ameliorate the problem somewhat. Personally, I 
believe that the problem of systematically and adequately 
providing these items cannot be solved in the short term, 
because tens of millions of dollars are needed and they are just 
not there. Now, there is a will, a commitment. We have preserved 
the production capabilities to try to alleviate the highly 
distressing shortage of these products. We are aware of this. We 
may experience a slight improvement in comparison with 1993.

<F P=106> [Reprot by Zenaida Ferrer Martinez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 20 Jan (PL) -- The Union of Young Communists 
(UJC) has increased its contacts with youth organizations and 
institutions around the world in recent years, currently 
maintaining relations with 218 entities in 61 countries. 
  In an exclusive interview with PRENSA LATINA, Juan Contino, 
the first secretary of the national UJC said there are new paths 
toward knowledge opening up for the world's younger generations, 
especially young people in Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe, 
and the socialist countries (China, Vietnam, and North Korea). 
  The youth leader welcomed the international demonstrations 
of 
solidarity and support received from all corners of the world, 
particularly those from people speaking out against the U.S. 
blockade of the island at public forums, even within the United 
States itself. 
  He said that many young friends of Cuba are launching an 
offensive to disseminate information all over the world 
regarding the democratic system on the island and its respect 
for human rights in an effort to counter the smear campaigns 
promoted by the enemies of the revolution. 
  He noted there has been a recent increase in examples of 
solidarity toward the Caribbean country's people in the form of 
events, demonstrations, and other means of dissemination, as 
well as in the form of assorted donations, particularly to 
contribute to the education effort. 
  Contino, who is also a member of the Central Committee, 
highlighted the fact that 334 youngsters belonging to 15 
international labor brigades visited the island in 1993. These 
individuals paid their own way and worked in the fields at the 
Paraiso Youth Camp in Havana Province, just outside this capital 
city. 
  Contino said activities similar to those carried out on the 
island to commemorate and support the Cuban sociopolitical 
system are currently being organized in 15 nations on the 
occasion of the 35th anniversary of the triumph of the 
revolution headed by Fidel Castro. These activities have been 
blessed "by Cuba forever." 
  He said that groups of youth leaders are going to various 
parts of the world and will participate in festivities in 
countries such as Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, Spain, France, 
Italy, Portugal, and Vietnam, among others. 
  The 33-year-old economist, who has seven years of experience 
as a youth leader, expressed his gratitude to youth and student 
organizations, associations, and entities from throughout the 
world for making it possible for the UJC to expand its contacts 
and exchange programs abroad during the current difficult 
situation. 
  Contino said the 550,000 UJC militants who represent Cuba's 
3.1 million young people are making efforts to deserve the 
esteem of friends from other countries and are giving foremost 
attention to their work in the edification of the Cuban 
socialist system. 
  The UJC is a selective organization that embodies the 
vanguard of the Cuban youth sector and has affiliates in all 
sectors of the island's social and economic life. The roots of 
this organization are in the country's secondary schools and 
universities. 
  The UJC was founded on 4 April 1961. Hundreds of thousands 
of Cubans have been members of it -- in particular, many current 
leaders of the Communist Party of Cuba. According to Contino, 
the UJC views itself as the party's best quarry for talent -- 
one that shapes people who continue the tradition.

  [Text] Havana, 21 Jan (PL) -- Juan Contino, first secretary 
of the Union of Young Communists [UJC], denied today the 
existence of a generational struggle for political power in Cuba. 
  In an exclusive statement to PRENSA LATINA, Contino said 
there is a tendency to talk about a generational succession, 
which is an inappropriate term, because it implies: You got up 
to here; now I will continue alone. 
  He said there are three generations of revolutionaries 
living 
together in Cuba, and far from disagreeing they agree fully 
regarding principles, ideas, and goals of the revolutionary 
process, which began in January 1959. 
  Contino, who is 33 years old and a member of the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba, also denied Cuban 
society is facing a crisis of values. 
  Contino conceded, however, there are groups among the young 
population (5.7 million people, ranging between 0 and 30 years 
of age Cuba) that are involved in criminal activities, but this 
is triggered by the difficult economic situation Cuba is facing. 
  Contino said the crime rate has increased as well as 
displays 
of social indiscipline and "jineterismo" (a local term to denote 
a form of prostitution that is linked with tourism), but most of 
these cases are isolated cases and not the general behavior of 
young people. 
  Contino said that in the eyes of the UJC each individual 
case 
is undoubtedly a problem. He added the UJC is trying to 
approach those youths who are involved in criminal activities, 
so as to educate them. 
  Contino said there is a strong campaign against crime, 
because in the difficult situation Cuba is facing, there is a 
thin line between criminal and counterrevolutionary actions. 
  Contino said Cuban youths in general are highly motivated 
politically, which shatters the argument that young people are 
withdrawing from the revolutionary process. 
  Contino referred to relations with the young believers as 
very good, and he confirmed relations with their organizations 
are smooth. 
  The UJC was founded in April 1961 as a selective and leading 
organization, and it has a membership of 550,000 from the entire 
population of 3.1 million youths.

  [Text] Havana, 17 Jan (PL) -- Alexander Watson, the U.S. 
under secretary of state for inter-American affairs, today was 
called a buffoon and a vote grabber who is working the streets 
of Miami by Nicanor Leon Cotayo, a regular Cuban columnist. 
  In an article that appeared in the TRABAJADORES weekly, Leon 
Cotayo based his appraisal on Watson's statements during recent 
meetings with a sector of the Cuban community in Miami. 
  The columnist referred specifically to the 6 January meeting 
which was called by the high-ranking State Department official 
"to render accounts to a Cuban group on the U.S. Government's 
policies regarding the island." 
  In this respect, Leon Cotayo asserted, Watson defended the 
continuation of the blockade; supported the so-called Torricelli 
Law, which intensifies the blockade; and conditioned the 
cessation of this policy on a change in the Cuban political and 
economic system. 
  The columnist added that Watson had predicted the collapse 
of 
the revolution in the Caribbean nation as if such predictions 
had not been made since the blockade was intensified in 1990. 
  In Leon Cotayo's opinion, "it was another demonstration of 
Watson's commitment to the right-wing representatives of the 
Cuban community established in Miami." 
  It showed, the Cuban columnist added, Watson's inclination 
to 
back "the most varied, loud, and illusory conservative demands 
presented by this group and to handle the issue not as a foreign 
policy issue, but as an internal U.S. affair." 
  According to Watson's logic, Leon Cotayo indicated, if Cuba 
is basically an internal problem, it is not unrelated to the 
electoral process, and, therefore, the positions of the Cuban 
groups must be taken into account, especially the positions of 
those with more financial resources, political influence, and a 
clear loyalty to Washington's interests. 
  Nevertheless, it is still surprising that "high-ranking 
officials of a government that wants to systematically hold the 
reins of the world are, somewhat abjectly, willing to travel to 
a southern community in their extensive country to explain their 
policies to frustrated annexationist groups." 
  Leon Cotayo concludes: "Watson must assume the sad image 
which mixes a buffoon -- and, indeed, a buffoon of a town rather 
than a court -- with a vulgar vote grabber who is working the 
streets of Miami."

  [Text] Havana, 15 Jan (PL) -- Cuban Defense Minister Raul 
Castro has said that the most beautiful battle the people can 
win is to avoid war, which would be their greatest victory. 
  Even so, he described as positive the preparation, 
patriotism, and courage of the armies, Armed Forces in general, 
the militias, and the people of the island, who are capable of 
facing an enemy that is superior in forces and defeating it. 
  During a meeting to assess the Central Army, a meeting that 
concluded yesterday in Cienfuegos Province, in central Cuba, the 
commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR) praised the 
stability of that command and the effort made in 1993 preparing 
to defend the national territory. 
  He referred to the progress made by the troops in that part 
of the nation with regard to the maintenance and esprit de corps 
of combat techniques and weapons, with more than 1.8 million 
items being maintained (tanks and all kinds of weapons, 
including gas masks). 
  He recommended that a similar effort be made with farm, 
construction, and other equipment, equipment that cost millions 
of dollars. He added that this equipment is now idle due of the 
lack of fuel or spare parts resulting from the economic crisis 
Cuba is experiencing. 
  Castro praised the progress made in the plans to build 
people's tunnels, set up caves and other engineering projects 
whose implementation respond to a Cuban military theory of "war 
by the entire people" which involves the training of the 
population and the creation of conditions to defend each piece 
of land. 
  He also praised the plan to plant trees, a plan that reached 
122 million trees following a program on river basins, energy 
forests, fruit trees, and reforestation for defense purposes; 
together with farming and fishing activities so that troops can 
procure their own supplies. 
  The FAR minister also presided over the ceremony to start 
this year's defense preparations by the central army. The 
military organization has three armies -- the Western, Central, 
and Eastern Armies -- and various types of armed forces.

  [Text] Moscow, 14 Jan (PL) -- Rear Admiral Pedro Perez 
Betancourt, chief of the Cuban Revolutionary Navy, today visited 
Saint Petersburg (Leningrad), during the third day of his 
official visit to Russia. 
  Perez Betancourt, who was invited by Admiral Feliks Gromov, 
commander of the Russian Fleet, visited the Kustnezov Naval 
Academy and the main headquarters of Navigation and Oceanography 
at Rio Neva city, ITAR-TASS News Agency reported. 
  Perez Betancourt also met with Vice Admiral Vladimir 
Grishanov, commander of the naval base in the second largest 
city in the former Soviet nation. 
  The goal of these contacts initiated in Moscow two days ago, 
according to a source at the Cuban Embassy, is to exchange 
opinions on the progress of cooperation between both commands of 
the corresponding Armed Forces. 
  Perez Betancourt will conclude his official visit to Russia 
tomorrow after meeting with the high-ranking military chiefs. 
  The Cuban naval chief on Wednesday laid a wreath in Moscow 
at 
the tomb of the unknown soldier located on one side of the 
Kremlin wall before he met with Colonel General Mikhail 
Kolesnikov, chief of the General Staff and first deputy defense 
minister. 
  The visitor and Kolesnikov discussed the levels of friendly 
and cooperative relations between the armed institutions of both 
nations.

  [Text] Quito, 18 Jan (PL) -- President Sixto Duran-Ballen 
today canceled his visit to Peru scheduled later this week 
because of diplomatic difficulties that have arisen in recent 
days between the two countries. 
  Sources close to the president told PRENSA LATINA that the 
president decided a few hours ago to cancel his trip to Lima, 
Peru, and that -- for the time being -- no date has been set for 
his meeting with Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori. 
  Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Diego Paredes recently said that 
Duran-Ballen's trip to Lima was subject to some diplomatic 
details that were being worked out, inasmuch as this was a very 
complex trip because the topics to be discussed were very 
delicate. 
  One week ago, Fujimori told Ecuadoran newsmen that he was 
waiting for Duran-Ballen with open arms, but only to discuss 
topics on integration and economic cooperation and that he would 
not talk about the so-called "border conflict." 
  Diplomatic sources feel the Peruvian president's remarks and 
negative reaction from various public sectors prompted the 
Ecuadoran president to cancel his trip.

<F P=106> [Commentary by J.M.C.: "No Way Out"] </F>
  [Text] The recent promotion of Armed Forces officers close 
to General [Nicolas de Bari] Hermoza and Vladimiro Montesinos is 
proof of what everyone has been saying for the past few weeks: 
President Fujimori is being threatened by the military 
leadership and the SIN [National Intelligence Service]. The 
political autonomy Fujimori enjoyed until just before the 
referendum has been curtailed. 
  The truth is that Gen. Hermoza has positioned himself in the 
government and together with Vladimiro Montesinos, presidential 
adviser for intelligence affairs, is making decisions about the 
country's Armed Forces from the top of the pyramid. The two have 
decided that the three general commanders -- from the Army 
(Hermoza himself), the Navy, and Air Force -- cannot be removed 
from their posts. The police director also was included in this 
decision. 
  This decision has deeply irritated officers in each military 
branch because it bars the normal development of officers' 
professional careers and their promotion to the highest military 
positions. It is well known that within military circles there 
is a principle called "the cart principle" by which those in 
higher positions drag behind them those they trust. It seems 
that the commanders now want this cart to remain still without 
changing wheels annually, as occurred in the past. 
  The generals who were approaching the post of commander or 
chief of the various military institutions today are considered 
dangerous. For this reason, they have been assigned duties 
abroad or placed in posts called "bones" because they are not 
operational or trusted administrative posts (defense minister, 
CCFFAA [Joint Command of the Armed Forces], and CAEM [Advanced 
Military Studies Center]). 
  "The manipulation" still continues within the Army because 
Gen. Hermoza's command had been planning to replace some 
important division generals by sending them into retirement, 
among them General Valdivia (currently a military attache in 
far-away Ukraine). This high-ranking officer has been strongly 
criticized for his performance as military-political chief in 
Ayacucho, but he enjoys sound prestige within the Army, 
especially in the promotion of Vladimiro Montesinos, whom he 
instructed. 
  The plan to send more than 10 division generals into 
retirement had to be ruled out, at least until the middle of the 
year, because it might have caused too many problems within the 
Army. The situation of General Robles has caused sufficient 
problems. According to military sources, Robles might report to 
the nation another irregular military operation in the central 
region. We should not forget that Robles was the Army's 
third-in-command before they tried to get rid of him by sending 
him abroad; in his post he handled a large volume of secret 
information. 
  Another hot issue is the case of General Salinas Sedo, who 
is 
the best candidate according to many people. It will be 
possible to close ranks behind him in case of a possible attempt 
to reelect President Fujimori. Many people have demanded his 
release through presidential pardon, but so far there are no 
indications this will happen. The risk is that if he stays in 
jail, an adverse process might emerge in the middle of the 
elections because political parties might decide to abstain on 
the grounds that elections are not free because a citizen who 
might be the winner is imprisoned. 
  This is how things are in our Army. There is still another 
issue: Ten division generals have just been promoted, and 
irregularities have continued because among the promoted 
generals is Guido Guevara Guerra, who is a brigade general in 
the Army Legal Service and may not -- by law -- be promoted to 
division general, because his rank has been adjusted. However, 
now he is a division general. 
  Do you know why? Guevara was designated president of the 
Military Court Supreme Council because he is the top-ranking 
general (division general), and considering that the other 
council members will never reach that rank, he will always be 
(at least until July 1995) the council president. Last week he 
announced a life imprisonment penalty for four Chileans on "high 
treason" charges. Can a Chilean commit "high treason" against 
the fatherland, that is, against Peru, which is not his 
fatherland? We will comment on this penalty later.

<F P=106> [From the "Global TV News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Council of Ministers President Alfonso Bustamante 
and Economy and Finance Minister Jorge Camet have defended 
before the Budget Commission the tax plan that is being 
questioned by the country's mayors. They added that the 
government will not back down from continuing the controversial 
municipal tax plan. 
  The AMPE [Association of Peruvian Municipalities] 
representatives also attended the meeting with the Budget 
Commission and reiterated that Legislative Decree No. 776 is 
unconstitutional and violates municipal laws because it reduces 
local government revenues substantially. However, although 
Bustamante and Camet invited the mayors to a meeting on 17 
January, they showed no willingness to reform the plan. On the 
contrary, they justified it. 
  [Begin Bustamante recording] As mentioned many times before, 
by implementing this law, we seek the following: first, to 
simplify and modernize the municipal tax system; second, to 
guarantee, in one way or another, taxpayer stability regarding 
rates and taxes; third, it has a very clear decentralization 
effect; and fourth, it has a very clear distribution effect. 
[end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Camet said that although Congress is fully 
empowered to amend the decree, the government believes it is 
excellent because it increases municipal revenues, thus hinting 
that there will be no looking back. 
  [Begin recording] [Camet] This is an excellent reform to the 
municipal tax system based, as the prime minister said, on the 
redistribution of revenues collected by the central government 
to the districts. This redistribution will give more to those 
who have less. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Minister, please allow me. There 
is a lot of controversy because the government claims that there 
will be greater revenues while municipalities claim that there 
will be less. You handle figures; could you tell us exactly how 
many millions [currency not specified] were channeled to 
district and provincial municipalities under the previous law 
and how many millions they will receive from now on? 
  [Camet] Tax collection, as one of your fellow journalists 
said, will increase to 610 million [currency not specified]. 
Thus, all district municipalities will receive more in 1994 
than they received in 1993. [end recording]

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Lima Radio Programas del Peru Network in 
Spanish at 1410 GMT on 22 January broadcasts a 55-minute 
"Saturday Focus" program roundtable discussion hosted by Denis 
Vargas Marin and including Alfonso Bustamante, president of the 
Council of Ministers; Agusto Alvarez, director of the APOYO 
publishing house; Humberto Campodonico, economist and San Marcos 
University professor, and Arturo Salazar. 
  Vargas starts the discussion by mentioning that last week 
was 
marked by the conflicting situation in the economic field 
between mayors and the government due to a decree granting the 
government control over municipal taxes. Vargas says: "Many of 
the nation's mayors believe this is an unconstitutional 
measure." Vargas asks what was the true spirit of this measure, 
and "how will the economy be administered in 1994, how much 
longer must we wait for economic reactivation, and the so longed 
for sustained growth?" 
  Bustamante replies that there was no political criteria 
behind the government decree on municipal taxes although it is a 
political decision. Bustamante says: "To fight against poverty 
and for social investment, resources are required. Resources 
come from basically two sources: local taxes and foreign loans." 
Bustamante adds that tax collection is very important. This 
year, Bustamante notes, the government expects to collect larger 
amounts of taxes, and to redistribute these in a better fashion, 
noting that previously, of 100 million soles, 30 million went to 
the Lima municipality while the other 70 percent was for the 
rest of Peru. Bustamante indicates that the government wants the 
poorer districts to secure more funds. 
  Campodonico asks Minister Bustamante why the municipalities' 
revenues were taken away. To this Bustamante replies: "We are 
talking about municipal funds and in any case it is a large 
amount of money. What are we seeking? Obviously with this we 
want more to be distributed to the poor. From what resources 
are we going to get this? Well, this has to come from the 
resources collected locally." Bustamante then explains the 
amounts collected and assigned by the government to the 
municipalities. Salazar questions the government decision to 
take away municipal revenues as in the framework of the law, 
revenues for the central government are generated by general 
sales tax. 
  Salazar continues by noting that in Article 5 of the 
municipal law, it is set out that 2 percent of the general sales 
tax will be for municipalities. Salazar asks: "Is this not a 
technical incoherency? To this Bustamante replies that this is 
very easy to explain. The General Value Tax is 16 percent and 
the Tax on Business Holdings is 2 percent; added together these 
are the general sales tax." 
  Vargas says that to conclude with the municipalities issue, 
it had been recently announced that the government was going "to 
compensate the municipalities," from Treasury resources. "Is 
this not taking a step back?" Vargas asks. To this Bustamante 
replies that the government cannot halt the financing of 
important scheduled public projects, therefore the projects must 
be analyzed before making a decision. 
  Alvarez mentions to Bustamante that the question most people 
on the street want answered is: "When are salaries going to be 
raised?" What would you reply to these people, Alvarez asks. 
Bustamante replies that salary increases go hand in hand with an 
improved economy, the quality of the services rendered, and on 
the capacity to compete. As mentioned before, Bustamante tells 
Alvarez, in the private sector this is much clearer, as it must 
compete in the market. In the public sector, Bustamante notes, 
matters are much more complex, because despite government 
efforts "we still have a very large payroll to meet." Vargas 
insists on asking: "Will there be a salary increase that is not 
the minimum wage this year?" Bustamante replies that a 30 
percent salary increase for public workers has been earmarked in 
the budget. 
  Campodonico then asks why the government conveys the image 
that foreign investment is coming in and that we are paying less 
than what is coming in while the numbers indicate exactly the 
opposite? To this Bustamante replies to Campodonico that he does 
not have the complete picture; while great efforts are being 
made to foster exports, privatization is a first step for 
foreign investment and implementing social programs requires 
greater revenues for the treasury. Bustamante indicates that 
investment needs to grow and that Peru does not have $5 billion 
in savings for investment; therefore it must look for foreign 
investment. 
  Vargas asks why beer is taxed 30 percent while whisky is 
taxed less. "What has been the spirit of this law?" Vargas 
asks. Bustamante replies that the this is a selective tax on the 
consumer although he notes in his opinion it is a bit high. 
  To conclude Alvarez says that in real terms the budget has 
been increased but not salaries. Alvarez asks: "Why is 
something not done to avoid the continuous loss of purchasing 
power for salaries? Bustamante replies that in the private 
sector it is absurd to pay low salaries if these can be raised. 
  Vargas asks Bustamante if he would accept being the next 
economy minister to which he replies that he certainly would not.

  [Text] Lima, 23 Jan (EFE) -- The attitude of Alexander 
Watson -- U.S. under secretary of state for Inter-American 
Affairs -- during his recent visit to Peru was considered 
paternalistic in an editorial published today by EXPRESO, a Lima 
daily. 
  In a critical tone, the editorial noted that the U.S. high- 
ranking government official who was in Lima this week on a 
three-day official visit "came and took notes -- as if he had a 
superior right -- as to whether we have `progressed' in 
democracy, justice administration, and human rights." 
  The daily considers that Watson gave the impression of 
encouraging those who object to "the very existence of 
(President Alberto Fujimori's) government and the new 
Constitution," making reference to the meeting the under 
secretary of state held with opposition political sectors. 
  "It is not a way to create a climate of democratic consensus 
that will close the gap opened on 5 April. It is not enough to 
call for a dialogue," EXPRESO comments in reference to the 5 
April 1992 coup staged by Fujimori in which he dissolved 
Congress and stripped the Judicial Branch, while he assumed 
total power. 
  EXPRESO -- which supports the government -- adds that Watson 
admitted that in Peru progress had been made with respect to 
human rights and democracy. Nevertheless, he had said "there is 
still much more to do."

  [Editorial Report] 
<H5>  Poll on Fujimori, Government Policy </H5>
  A November poll shows the Peruvian Government as a whole 
enjoying a 54-percent approval rate, while President Fujimori's 
performance gets a 67-percent approval rate. (The poll was taken 
a few weeks after the 31 October referendum on the new 
Constitution, a referendum which was widely interpreted as a 
vote for or against Fujimori. The Constitution barely passed, 
receiving a 52-percent approval rate.) The November figures 
represent a 13-percent drop for the government but only a 
3-percent drop for the president from the preceding month's 
Apoyo poll. The report of the poll of metropolitan Lima 
residents, aged 18 or above, of "all socio-economic levels," as 
published in the 29 November issue of the Apoyo-owned weekly 
SEMANA ECONOMICA, did not indicate the number of respondents, 
date, or margin of error. 
  A full 76 percent of those interviewed approve of the 
government's anti-terrorism policy (an insignificant drop of 1 
percent from Apoyo's October poll, according to the published 
figures). Approval of the privatization program was also 
unchanged since October, registering an insignificant drop from 
57 to 56 percent. The government's economic policy suffered a 
decline in popularity, with only 42 percent (down 5 percent from 
October) voicing approval. 
  Along with the slight drop in approval ratings for President 
Fujimori and the more marked drop for the Peruvian Government, 
approval for the political opposition was essentially unchanged 
from November (slightly increasing from 29 to 31). 
<H5>  Terrorism, Unemployment as National Problems </H5>
  In a poll published in the November 1993 issue of the 
Apoyo-owned monthly PERU ECONOMICO interviewees identified 
terrorism, unemployment, and "food" [alimentacion] as the major 
national concerns, in descending order. The poll was conducted 
by Apoyo between 8 and 11 October 1993 with 500 residents of 
metropolitan Lima spanning the socio-economic strata. 
  Some 41 percent of those interviewed chose terrorism as the 
most important national problem, no significant change from the 
same period in 1992, but lower than in the years 1988-1991. 
  PERU ECONOMICO notes that unemployment, second among 
national 
concerns with 36 percent, was of higher concern to the top 
socio-economic group (43 percent) than to those of moderate 
means and the poor. In the poorest group, unemployment and 
terrorism were given equal weight as major national problems. 
  The third most pressing national problem, identified by 27 
percent of the interviewees, was the general category of "food." 
This concern has fluctuated widely in the last two years, 
affecting 7 percent more respondents in 1992, but 9 percent 
fewer the previous year. 
  Of other problems perceived as national, drug trafficking 
was 
mentioned by almost twice as many respondents in October (19 
percent) as had done so in April (10 percent). Drug abuse 
concerned 19 percent of respondents, with the poor much more 
likely to express concern (24 percent) than the wealthy (5 
percent). On the other hand, worries about inflation sharply 
declined from 62 percent in 1990, to 31 in 1991, 24 in 1992, and 
a mere 14 percent in October 1993. It now ranks ninth in the 
Apoyo poll among the nation's major problems. Other identified 
national problems were poverty (23 percent), "inadequate 
education" (16 percent), cost of living (16 percent), and human 
rights violations (14 percent). 
<H5>  Expectations Rising </H5>
  An Apoyo poll published in the December issue of PERU 
ECONOMICO indicates more widespread optimism about Peru's 
future. Asked whether the country was going in the right or 
wrong direction, 65 percent of the respondents said it was going 
in the right direction, an increase of 9 percent since a similar 
poll in July 1992. Just 22 percent said in the wrong direction, 
a drop of 4 percent, while 13 percent were undecided. Similarly, 
53 percent said the country is "progressing," a sharp increase 
from just 5 percent in August 1990, while only 11 percent 
declared it to be "declining," down from 54 percent in the same 
period. While 32 percent described the country as "stagnating," 
this marked a decline from 53 percent in June 1991 and 42 
percent in March 1993. 
  Fifty-three percent said Peru would be a better place to 
live 
in 20 years (compared to 40 percent in 1991). Forty-one percent 
said they had positive expectations for their personal lives 
over the next year (compared to 17 percent in June 1990), and 44 
percent had positive expectations for the country over the same 
period (compared with 39 percent in September 1990, but only 16 
percent in June 1991, a month after the Shining Path's "armed 
sitdown" day, accompanied by many assassinations and other 
attacks, as well as the temporary takeover of a number of radio 
stations).

<F P=106> [Article by Alberto Adrianzen M.: "Trapped With No Way </F>
Out?"] 
  [Text] This Christmas may not be President Fujimori's best 
one. The engineer's presents--and oh, what Christmas 
presents!--will be the task of solving several problems that he 
surely never thought would come up. 
  First of all, the results of the 31 October referendum, 
which 
were a real surprise. The government was expecting a result of 
more than 65 percent, which would enable it to guarantee the 
future reelection of President Fujimori and finish out the cycle 
begun on 5 April. In other words, to legitimize and legalize the 
Fujimori regime itself in a single act. That has not been 
possible. The new constitution is practically stillborn. In this 
context, the weakness of the new constitution as a legal basis 
for Fujimorism is a fact of life. 
  Secondly, what was going to be the political basis of 
Fujimorism, an indisputable electoral-legal majority, is also in 
doubt. The near stalemate and the triumph of the "no" vote in 
more than a dozen departments have shattered the dream of an 
overwhelming, undeniable political majority that would be loyal 
to the president personally. Moreover, there is the uncertainty 
of foreign and national investors in the face of the election 
results and the political scandals that will certainly come to 
light in connection with the handling of the debt papers. 
  These developments have a variety of consequences. The most 
important one is the beginning of the presidential campaign for 
1995, which shows how fragile President Fujimori's future 
prospects are. Some sectors are already seeking to build a 
Fujimorism without Fujimori. Meanwhile, others (such as Daniel 
Estrada, Ricardo Belmont, and Luis Caceres) are practically in 
full swing in their presidential campaigns. 
  The other major consequence is that the opposition and other 
social sectors have managed to open up new opportunities and 
place themselves in an expectant situation. This fact is so 
obvious that even the extraparliamentary opposition, sidelined 
until very recently, has managed to raise its head, as evidenced 
by Belaunde's presence at a rally held not too long ago in the 
city of Iquitos. 
  Evidently, President Fujimori's legitimacy and the legality 
of the political regime inaugurated on 5 April are now being 
called into question. One indication of this weakness, for 
example, is the way the La Cantuta case has been unfolding. 
  Another manifestation is the president's appeal for a 
national accord. It shows a desire to bring order to a political 
situation that got out of the government's control on 31 
October. The goal is to shift the government's political 
position with respect to public opinion, which wants consensus 
and is sick of confrontations,[.sup]1[/] and at the same time 
to head off the avalanche of constitutional amendments that the 
opposition and other social sectors are proposing. 
<H5>  La Cantuta: A Political Test </H5>
  The people who committed the atrocity of La Cantuta 
certainly 
never imagined that their actions would unleash a political 
scandal or give rise to an investigation, much less that the 
incident would become one of the most disturbing developments 
for this government. The same group had probably been involved 
in other actions that were never investigated. One of them, in 
fact, the disappearance of almost an entire family in Huacho, is 
quite similar to the La Cantuta case. 
  Nevertheless, the La Cantuta affair, bravely revealed by the 
magazine SI, has placed the government on the horns of a 
dilemma: Either it knuckles under to pressure from the military 
not to allow a serious investigation of this atrocity, punishing 
only those who directly participated in the operation, or it 
decides to face the issue head-on, jeopardizing the so-called 
military hierarchy and the Armed Forces' perception of Fujimori 
as their leader. 
  It should be noted that after the accusations made by 
Congressman Henry Pease in April of last year, the military, 
without even consulting the president, decided to take the tanks 
out into the streets. 
  Furthermore, the problem of La Cantuta has ceased to be 
simply a matter of human rights violations; it has also become a 
kind of political test that will measure institutional and group 
responses and relationships that are important to this 
government. 
  Several institutions are involved in La Cantuta. The first 
one is the Democratic Constituent Congress (CCD) itself, which, 
having changed its earlier position in view of the overwhelming 
evidence, has now demanded that the matter be handled by 
civilian courts rather than military ones. 
  Another institution involved is the judiciary, which will 
have to determine soon, when the prosecutor decides to file 
charges, whether the La Cantuta affair is a matter of common or 
military jurisdiction. The military courts' objections to 
prosecutors' questioning the military personnel allegedly 
involved in this multiple crime, and their refusal to turn over 
information to the CCD on the grounds that the matter is outside 
its jurisdiction, show just how far the stonewallers can go. 
  The Armed Forces themselves are involved as an institution, 
and to be perfectly honest, the political survival of the Army's 
top echelon is at stake, in view of the accusations by General 
Robles from his asylum in Argentina that they were accomplices 
in this criminal incident. 
  There is something more, as well. The solution to the La 
Cantuta case will also serve to assess the relationship between 
President Fujimori's government and that of the United States. 
It is well known that the Clinton administration, ambiguities 
aside, is anxious for this case to be resolved on the best 
possible terms as a first step toward changing the command 
structure of the Armed Forces. 
  And finally, the relationship between President Fujimori and 
the military hierarchy, one of the pillars of the regime 
inaugurated on 5 April, is at stake. President Fujimori's recent 
confirmation of the commanders-in-chief of the various branches 
of the military, including the police, and the scandalous 
exclusion of Parliament from the process of promoting the 
highest-ranking officers[.sup]2[/] show not only that he has 
already made one decision--to protect the senior military 
commanders--but also that there is some instability in the 
relationship between the military leadership and the president 
that could result in a coup d'etat or in a change of personnel 
in that leadership. 
  For this reason, as we have stated, the La Cantuta case is a 
true political test. At risk is the autonomy of the 
aforementioned institutions, as well as the ability of the key 
players to exert pressure. There is, then, a direct relationship 
between the institutions' independence and the political power 
they theoretically wield. The latter is important, given that 
one of the variables for measuring the authoritarianism of a 
regime is precisely the degree of autonomy--and therefore 
power--exercised by these institutions. 
  If the judiciary decides to stay out of the La Cantuta case 
or to defer to the military courts, we can conclude, once again, 
that this institution is not autonomous and, therefore, that 
either it is a mere appendage of the government or it has no 
power. The same can be said of the CCD. 
  This would confirm the notion that the objectives of the 
self-coup of 5 April were not to reform the judiciary or the 
political system. Rather, these objectives can be found in the 
logic of the neoliberal economic model, the antisubversion 
strategy itself, and the role of the military, as shown in the 
documents published by the magazine OIGA.[.sup]3[/] 
  For this reason, the danger of this kind of political 
development, and of La Cantuta, is that they reveal the real 
intensions of power, and therefore, they always end up imposing 
a "zero sum" logic in which the gains of the victorious are 
based on the total losses of the defeated. 
  To put it another way, if the triumph of Fujimori and the 
military hierarchy in the La Cantuta affair is based on the 
unconditional defeat of the opposition and greater political 
control over the institutions of the regime, it entails greater 
involvement by the military in the government, since it is the 
military that has actually won the game. Consequently, now the 
groundwork has really been laid for a transition toward a 
civilian-military government that could, in the short term, as 
more incidents such as La Cantuta are revealed,[.sup]4[/] 
turn into a military government. 
  That is why, if the results of 31 October represent a severe 
blow to the future of President Fujimori and his government, La 
Cantuta reveals a president walking into a blind alley. Mr. 
Fujimori has ended up entangled in his own alliances. 
  The question is whether he is trapped for good, in which 
case 
he could become an irrelevancy, depending on how things unfold, 
or whether he will decide to put on a military uniform. The 
tragedy in all this is that it would not be the uniform of 
Francisco Bolognesi or Miguel Grau, but that of Martin Rivas or 
Nicolas de Bari Hermoza. This uniform could quickly take on a 
black hue. There is, however, another option: changing the 
military leadership. 
Footnotes 
  1. The surveys conducted by the agency IMASEN immediately 
after 31 October yielded the following results: About 80 percent 
thought the Constitution should be amended before being 
promulgated; 73 percent thought there should be a political 
accord between the government and the opposition. It should be 
mentioned that the IMASEN survey was conducted in Lima, one of 
the government's most important political bastions. 
  2. Actually, rather than assuage the Army's fears about La 
Cantuta, the promotions have caused greater consternation. For 
example, as some news media, including the magazine SI, have 
pointed out, no one from the artillery, to which Gen. Valdivia 
belongs, has been promoted to major general. 
  3. We are referring to the documents published by that 
magazine several months ago. According to the magazine, the 
documents, of military origin, mention a political plan to 
govern this country for at least 15 years, through either a 
civilian government or a military regime. 
  4. As we finished writing this article, Channel 9, ATV, 
reported the disappearance of nine people in Chimbote in May of 
last year. The operation followed a pattern quite similar to 
that of La Cantuta. There was an attack in the area, and a few 
days later nine people suspected of being Shining Path members 
disappeared. This time the accusations have focused on the Navy, 
so it is not just the Army that is involved in this kind of 
action, but another branch of the military as well.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Panamanian President Guillermo </F>
Endara at the Presidential Palace by Hugo Enrique Famania at the 
RPC studios in Panama City -- live] 
  [Text] [Famania] Good morning, Mr. President. 
  [Endara] Good morning to you Famania and to all your 
viewers. 
I would like to begin by thanking Professor Ruben Dario Carles 
for his remarks about me. I must reiterate that I have a very 
high opinion of him. At no time during this political campaign 
will I be able to speak ill of him because we have been and will 
continue to be friends for the rest of our lives. Moreover, I 
must say that as comptroller he always supported my presidency 
and I as president supported him as comptroller. 
  I would like to begin by saying something that all of the 
news media have repeated and which you just announced on 
television. It has been said that on Saturday I said the 
members of Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement] 
are traitors. I challenge your television station and the other 
news media which reported it, because everything I say in public 
is recorded. Bring me the recording in which I characterized 
the members of Molirena as traitors. I did not do that and I 
would like you to prove that I did without playing any tricks 
with the tapes. 
  I said the members of Molirena had spurned the Arnulfists 
[PA]. I wanted to be a witness as to why an agreement could not 
be reached by the parties and that is why I called a meeting on 
Friday -- I believe it was Friday -- to find out what was 
happening with my administration. I did not want to meddle in 
politics, I only wanted to know what was happening with my 
administration. I reached the conclusion that the PA-Molirena 
conflict was solely that Molirena had taken it into their heads 
that they wanted a certain electoral circuit when the PA already 
had a candidate in that circuit. They felt that their candidate 
was deserving of some privilege or other. The PA then proposed 
that each party put forward its candidate and allow the people 
to make the decision. Molirena did not like this and in my 
opinion they spurned and humiliated us. It hurts me very much 
when the PA is humiliated or spurned. I know that for certain 
political parties we are scum [lumpen], the lowest sector of the 
people and they have always despised us. I had never seen 
Molirena behave this way and when I saw this it hurt me to the 
core; it hurt me very much. I had experienced this situation 
with the Christian Democratic Party but never with Molirena and 
it truly hurt me. However, I never characterized them as 
traitors because they have never been traitors. I challenge you 
to bring me the evidence that I characterized them as traitors. 
  [Famania] Mr. President, we have asked our coordinator to 
play the recording of the incident on Saturday. We will be 
broadcasting it later so this situation will be clarified. This 
incident is also commented on in LA PRENSA's "As of Today" 
column but I will leave it at that.... 
  [Endara, interrupting] Yes, but LA PRENSA's "As of Today" 
column is not infallible. That column has missed the target 
many times, so to speak. I would also like to explain something 
else. 
  [Famania] Go ahead, Mr. President. 
  [Endara] You have said, and it was announced a while ago on 
your television station, that I as president of the Republic 
supported Mireya [Mireya Gruber, PA's presidential candidate]. 
Yesterday I had distributed to all the newspapers the reasons 
why I did not attend the PA convention; it was precisely to 
avoid supporting any candidate, because I am president of the 
Republic. However, during a crisis within my party I must be 
with the party, not supporting it as president of the Republic 
but as a member. On Saturday night I was so hurt as an 
Arnulfist by the mistreatment, contempt, and humiliation we 
received from Molirena, that I had to be with the party; not to 
support it as president of the Republic or to give it the 
state's support, but because I wanted to be present. I have been 
and always will be an Arnulfist. However, as president, 
although I am an Arnulfist, I will remain neutral. I want 
everyone to know: I am and will remain an Arnulfist all of my 
life, but I will be neutral as president of the Republic. 
Therefore, you must not say that I made statements in support 
of Mireya Moscoso de Gruber or that the presidency is behind her. 
  Furthermore, it is very likely -- I have not made up my mind 
yet -- that I will appoint new ministers from the PA. It is 
possible. This does not mean that I am supporting the PA 
politically because I am going to demand that those ministers 
behave the same way I behave. They must not offer to any 
political party or candidate their political support, state 
support, state property, or their influence. 
  [Famania] Mr. President, the criticisms that are being 
leveled against this weekend's events as they pertain to you and 
to the presidency's role in all of this, is that a political 
meeting was held at the presidency of the Republic. Second, 
that you participated in the meeting, which was attended by the 
Arnulfist presidential ticket, and third, that certain 
presidential public relations officials even provided reporters 
with credentials to participate in the PA's 23 January 
convention. This is where doubts about your neutrality emerge, 
Mr. President. 
  [Endara] Let us deal with each accusation separately. 
Friday's meeting. [coughs] I held Friday's meeting after 
office hours and for the sole purpose of finding out what was 
happening with my administration. I saw that the political 
parties that had supported my government were engaged in a fight 
and this was affecting my government's stability. You had been 
reporting this for weeks; for at least 15 days. The problem was 
affecting my government's stability and I wanted to meet with 
them to find out what was happening. This was the purpose of 
Friday night's meeting. I was concerned over my administration 
because I am president of the Republic and it is my duty to be 
concerned over my administration. 
  [Famania] A brief question, Mr. President. If this was the 
case, why were Mision [National Unity Mission] and Solidaridad 
[Solidarity Party] invited? 
  [Endara] They were invited because they were participants in 
the negotiations and I wanted to know who was causing the 
problem. I wanted to know what my government's situation was. 
How could I exclude them from the meeting when they were 
participating in the talks? 
  On Saturday I visited [the PA headquarters] not to support 
the party but to be present at a time of crisis. My party had 
suffered a huge slight, it had been humiliated, and I wanted to 
share that difficult moment of humiliation; I wanted the party 
to have my support, not my political support but the support of 
a fellow party member who felt as spurned and humiliated as they 
did. 
  Third, I think you were undoubtedly speaking about 
Presidential Press Secretary Rene Hernandez. Hernandez has been 
on vacation for approximately two months and I believe he still 
has another month to go. During his vacation he can do whatever 
he wants to; he could be at the beach but he prefers to do this. 
I have no proof that he distributed press [credentials] but 
while he is on vacation he can do as he pleases, just as you do. 
However, he was not working with the presidency because he is 
on vacation. 
  [Famania] Mr. President can you confirm that changes will be 
made? Are you aware that by making these changes the same thing 
that happened when the Christian Democratic Party [PDC] was 
separated could happen again? Many Panamanians appointed by 
Molirena ministers may lose their jobs. 
  [Endara] Molirena has spoken of resignations. Several 
Molirena employees have spoken of resigning and I must remind 
you that in the PDC's case, I would estimate that 99 percent of 
the separations resulted from resignations, not dismissals. I 
believe the same thing will happen with Molirena but they have 
not announced that. 
  [Famania] When will you decide on cabinet changes? 
  [Endara] I am thinking it over now and I will make the 
announcement in due time. 
  [Famania] Will you appoint Arnulfists or independents? 
  [Endara] I will make the announcement in due time. 
  [Famania] These changes could affect your administration. 
  [Endara] Affect it as a result of the changes? Well, of 
course, all changes affect an administration, but the effects 
can be favorable or unfavorable. I hope it will be favorable. 
  [Famania] Mr. President, thank you very much for speaking 
with us this morning.

<F P=106> [Report by Carlos Vargas] </F>
  [Text] The Authentic Liberal Party [PLA] yesterday 
nominated Mireya Moscoso de Gruber for president, Arnulfo 
Escalona for first vice president, and Jose Teran Sitton for 
second vice president during the party's fourth national 
convention in Chitre, Herrera Province. 
  Only six delegates, including Legislator Hernan Gnaeggi and 
Luis Ramon Fabrega, abstained from voting in favor of the 
presidential ticket proposed by convention leader Joaquin 
Fernando Franco, who chaired the PLA meeting. 
  A total of 221 out of 257 delegates attended the convention, 
which proceeded slowly after starting three hours late due to a 
blackout. Franco said the process was slow "because we took the 
utmost care to avoid having to face another challenge." 
  The convention delegates amended two articles of the party's 
statutes and elected the National Executive Authority with 
chairman Arnulfo Escalona, the members of the National Political 
Authority, and the members of the Honor Court.

<F P=106> [Report by Manuel Alvarez Cedeno] </F>
  [Text] During its national convention yesterday, the 
Arnulfist Party (PA) announced that its presidential ticket will 
be headed by Mireya Moscoso de Gruber. At the same time, the 
main PA leaders accused their former Molirena [Nationalist 
Liberal Republican Movement] allies of being "traitors and 
Judases" for abandoning the official coalition. 
  The 354 convention delegates voted in favor of the slate 
headed by Mrs. Gruber. The slate also includes veteran 
politician Arnulfo Escalona of the Liberal Authentic Party (PLA) 
as the first vice-presidential candidate, and the second 
vice-presidential candidate is National Liberal Party (PLN) 
member Jose Teran Sitton. 
  Sources close to the convention organizing committee 
indicated that they had rented about 1,500 buses capable of 
transporting 60 people each. This totals nearly 90,000 
participants and another 30,000 who arrived on their own. 
  The PA candidate stated that "once more on 8 May we will 
prove that the party founded by Arnulfo Arias has never lost an 
election." 
  In referring to Molirena, she said, "I am quite sure that 
those, who for merely selfish and unworthy reasons are not with 
us today, will be lamenting their decision by tomorrow." 
  Once the convention ended at approximately 1500, the 
government party presidential ticket headed to a dais located in 
front of Santa Ana Park where they addressed their supporters. 
Mrs. Gruber took the opportunity to present her government 
program which includes, among other things, a "well-prepared" 
plan to confront poverty, create at least 100,000 jobs, and a 
frontal attack against drug trafficking. 
  According to the PA candidate, the state will continue to 
promote public projects by resorting to private sector resources 
as much as possible. The PA government will continue to work 
closely with workers organizations and encourage them to 
contribute to resolving the nation's economic problems. 
  According to Mrs. Gruber, the Arnulfist government will 
continue honoring commitments, such as the foreign debt payment, 
to enable the country to remain in good credit standing. 
  In addition, she added, "We will follow a rational public 
spending policy, we will respect the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, 
and we will hold a referendum on the presence of U.S. military 
bases beyond the year 2000." 
  Escalona, meanwhile, said the PA presidential ticket 
represents the country's lower classes, while Teran said, "We 
have to guarantee that those who sowed death and fear in the 
country will never return to power." 
  Before the officials on the slate spoke, leader Jose Aleman 
said during the convention that the "bad liberals" (members of 
Molirena), who have betrayed Endara are currently holding a sad 
Judas convention (at the Atlapa Convention Center). 
  Aleman said: "We are going to eat those bad liberals in a 
double rooster soup [the rooster is Molirena's party symbol]. 
Tomorrow we are going to chop off their heads, and then we will 
eat them. Those bad liberals should be taken out of the 
government." In turn, this those attending the event shouted: 
"Take them out, take them out." 
  Meanwhile the PLA held its convention in Chitre, where it 
ratified its support for Gruber. Before the convention was 
held, Legislator German Gnaeggi said a group of convention 
participants, most of them from Cocle Province, would support 
the candidacy of former Comptroller Ruben Dario Carles instead 
of Mireya de Gruber, but the motion was not presented during the 
convention.

<F P=106> [Report by Mirna Ortega from the "Telemetro Reports" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Arnulfist Party [PA] officials are meeting at the 
Presidency to study the possible withdrawal of Molirena 
[Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement] members from the posts 
they currently occupy in government. Right now, and at the 
request of President Guillermo Endara, PA presidential candidate 
Mireya Moscoso de Gruber and PA leader Carlos Rodriguez are 
meeting with him at the Presidency of the Republic. 
  When she arrived at the Presidency, Dona Mireya Moscoso de 
Gruber talked to reporters and commented on the possible 
withdrawal of the current Molirena ministers. 
  [Begin recording] [Gruber] The president will have to make 
this decision, and it will be a hard decision to make. Members 
of Molirena, as well as members of the Authentic Liberal Party 
and the PA, have served to support his government. Therefore, I 
believe the president must choose what is best the country -- 
not for his party or for himself -- at this time. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Do you think the government will 
work 
the same if Molirena is not in the government alliance? 
  [Gruber] We, the Arnulfists, feel a bit uncomfortable with 
the situation, because the members of Molirena are now going to 
be in the opposition. I believe the government will not work 
properly without them. Nevertheless, the president must make 
the decision, and we should leave it in his hands. 
  [Reporter] Will the Arnulfists make any recommendations on 
this issue? 
  [Gruber] No, we have not talked to the president yet. 
  [Reporter] Is that the reason for today's meeting? 
  [Gruber] The president called me and said he wanted to talk 
to me. I will learn the reason for the meeting when I meet with 
him. [end recording] 
  Mireya Moscoso also acknowledged that the president and his 
government team will be faced with a difficult task if Molirena 
withdraws from the government. 
  [Begin recording] [Gruber] President Endara's relations with 
the Legislative Assembly will be difficult. However, I hope the 
legislators will act to help the country and not a specific 
party. Their responsibility is to further the good of the 
country, not to further their own interests. That is why they 
were elected. 
  [Reporter] Has President Endara's government been weakened 
with the latest events and with Molirena's possible withdrawal 
from government? 
  [Gruber] I do not think so. The PA is a big party. We 
demonstrated it yesterday when more than 100,000 people backed 
us at Santa Ana. Those people are the president's political 
backing. [end recording]

  [Text] Managua, 24 Jan (DPA) -- Passenger and light cargo 
transportation in Managua was reduced today due to the strike 
called by the National Transportation Commission [CNT] to demand 
a number of social-economic benefits from Violeta Chamorro's 
government. 
  Sit-down strikes by taxi drivers could be seen this morning 
(local) in different parts of the capital, while the police 
carried out strict surveillance. Part of the population had to 
walk long distances to get to work due to the lack of buses. 
  It is estimated that 60 percent of the urban transportation 
system of Managua is supporting the strike. Two hundred twenty 
buses of the "Parrales Vallejos" cooperative, the strongest in 
Managua are parked at stations and along some streets. 
  Managua's transportation system moves approximately 500,000 
persons daily. The CNT announced that the pressures for 
attaining a freeze on the price of oil derivatives will increase 
depending on how negotiations with the government, which will 
begin in the next few hours, progress. 
  President Violeta Chamorro said she expected there would be 
no violent actions and proposed a meeting with the five groups 
that are made up of transportation businessmen. Meanwhile, it 
was learned that the government is trying to get Cardinal Miguel 
Obando y Bravo to mediate the negotiations. 
  The CNT proposed a bilateral meeting with the finance, 
transportation, and labor ministers, who signed accords last 
September and whom the transporters believe are responsible for 
the unfulfilled agreements. 
  Carlos Palma, leader of the strike, said violent outbreaks 
will be avoided by keeping the buses at the stations. Regarding 
the new strike, Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, who will travel 
today to the Vatican, said he hopes the uprising that left 
several dead and hundreds wounded and jailed last year will not 
be repeated. 
  Daniel Ortega, former president and secretary general of the 
opposition Sandinist National Liberation Front said the 
government has forced transportation businessmen to strike. 
Ortega and Obando agree on the need for a negotiated solution 
to the social-political conflict.

  [Text] We have last-minute information on the negotiations 
between leaders of the transportation sector and the government. 
[four-second break in transmission] We repeat: The 
negotiations between the transportation workers and government 
have been broken off. We receive this last-minute report from 
Carlos Torres, chief editor of the "Five O'Clock Sharp" 
newscast. Carlos Torres, tell us what has happened. 
  [Torres] The negotiations between the government and the 
transportation sector were broken off a few hours ago. The 
members of the National Transportation Commission withdrew, 
because they are demanding the government conduct the 
negotiations only with the National Transportation Commission. 
  Labor Minister Francisco Rosales expressed regret over the 
withdrawal of the National Transportation Commission members and 
said the government had called the entire National 
Transportation Council to study the agreements. The Nicaraguan 
Transportation Chamber president reported that three members of 
the Transportation Chamber were attacked in the Metro Centro 
sector this morning and directly accused Roberto Gonzalez, the 
main leader of the Parrales Vallejos [bus cooperative] of being 
involved in this event. Gonzalez denied his accusations, however. 
  Francisco Rosales and Emilio Pereira, the labor and finance 
ministers respectively, have just gone to the second floor of 
the National Assembly to talk to Assembly President Luis 
Humberto Guzman to try to find a solution to the transportation 
problem. Roberto Gonzalez and members of the National 
Transportation Commission have said their demands will be 
tougher tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nicaraguan Central Bank President Jose </F>
Taboada by unidentified reporter in Managua, dated not given; 
from the "Extravision" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Minister, the disbursement that was just 
made is a result of this agreement and it involves $40 million 
that President Bill Clinton had promised to President Chamorro 
in December. How will the $40 million be spent now that this 
agreement was signed? I ask this question because there are 
great expectations. It has been said that the country faced 
economic problems, more economic problems when the aid was not 
disbursed. The $40 million will be forthcoming. The $40 million 
will reportedly, and according to U.S. Ambassador Maisto, be 
credited to Nicaragua's account this week. How will the $40 
million be spent? 
  [Taboada] This is a donation that will be applied to our 
balance of payments. This means that those resources will be 
added to Central Bank reserves. The Central Bank may sell this 
foreign currency to Nicaraguan importers, pay oil debts, or pay 
debts to multilateral financial organizations in Washington. 
Those are basically the three options for which we may earmark 
the foreign currency that will be deposited in the Central Bank. 
  [Reporter] [Question indistinct] 
  [Taboada] The entire debt, the debt in arrears, which is a 
government priority, may be paid with these funds as long as 
such payments are made to multilateral financial organizations 
such as the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank. We 
cannot use this money to pay Germany, for example. 
  [Reporter] How much does the Nicaraguan debt amount to at 
present? 
  [Taboada] The Nicaraguan debt, unfortunately, is more than 
$10 billion. This is why the government has focused efforts on 
renegotiating and obtaining pardons for our debt. Thus, the 
stock [previous word in English] of the debt continues to be 
very high. This is why when we talk about payments on our debt 
it must be clearly understood that we are referring to payments 
of that part of the debt that the government considers to be a 
priority. We must pay about $254.5 million in 1994. 
  [Reporter] Minister, you talked about a deficit in our trade 
balance. How much does it amount to? 
  [Taboada] That deficit could reach $400 million, perhaps a 
little more. This is why we need to cover this deficit with 
foreign cooperation, that is, loans or donations. 
  [Reporter] Minister, let us switch to another topic: the 
signing of the ESAF [Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility]. 
You said moments ago that the ESAF was signed. The ESAF is a 
reality. The signing of this agreement was strongly questioned 
months ago, last year, late last year when the first IMF and 
World Bank delegation visited our country. The government was 
unable to sign at that time. Days later a new delegation of the 
IMF and a World Bank delegation arrived to finalize the signing 
of the ESAF. 
  My question is: Opposition leaders, Sandinist leader Daniel 
Ortega thinks that the signing of this agreement will bring 
about negative effects, because there is talk of drastic public 
expenditure reductions. Will this bring about positive or 
negative consequences? The government argues that the signing 
of this agreement will bring about positive results for the 
entire population. What are the final conditions for the 
signing of this agreement called ESAF? 
  [Taboada] We are now at a stage in which structural reforms 
have already been agreed upon. For example, in the financial 
sector we will continue to maintain the independence of the Bank 
Superintendency. This commitment was also acquired by the 
Legislative Branch through Law 125. 
  There are at times attempts to reaffirm [reiterar] aspects 
that are already recognized or contained in the government plan. 
Such aspects include the independence of the Bank 
Superintendency, the role of state-owned banks as effective 
mediation instruments in the financial sector, and the continued 
efforts to further reduce bank operational costs and increase 
revenues. In sum, to turn banks into instruments to support 
Nicaraguan production activities. 
  There are also reforms, that is, agreements in the fiscal 
area to reduce exonerations, except, obviously, those granted by 
law. The idea is to benefit Nicaraguan society with the 
collection of taxes from certain import sectors that are 
currently exonerated and not protected by law. 
  [Reporter] What about a reduction in public expenditures? 
  [Taboada] We realize the need to make further adjustments, 
that is, reduce public expenditures, in keeping with the 
resources available to the Nicaraguan economy, that is, the 
revenues that will be at our disposal from taxes, funds 
collected by public sector companies, and loans and donations. 
We must continue our efforts to reduce the size of the 
nonfinancial public sector to secure resources to ensure that 
the private sector is able to produce.

  [Text] Alfonso Moncada Guillen, president of the 
Independent Liberal Party for National Unity, has said the 
party's new position is to search for the unity of liberalism, 
although "not necessarily with the current leaders of the other 
liberal parties." 
  On 18 January at "La India" cafe, Moncada Guillen held a 
joint news conference with representatives of the Central 
American Unionist Party, chaired by party leader Blanca Rojas, 
and representatives of the National Justice Party (PJN), led by 
Jorge Diaz Cruz. 
  These three parties issued a communique in which they 
pointed 
out that given the serious political, social, and economic 
situation Nicaragua is experiencing: "We have decided to join 
efforts to search for alternative solutions, hoping Nicaraguan 
society will accept them, and together we will struggle for 
their implementation." 
  The three political leaders expressed that currently the 
nation is going through dramatic times as a result of poverty, 
the lack of moral values, the disparagement of its political 
leaders, "and the lack of specific projects" to solve 
Nicaragua's problems. 
  In the communique, they also invited all Nicaraguans to 
participate in a project they called "Unity for Change," which 
adopts a "credible and trustworthy" political platform that 
renews the people's spirit to work and their hope in the future. 
  At the news conference, Moncada Guillen, who is also a 
doctor, indicated this initiative was taken to create a new 
political culture, that turns its back on the past and looks 
toward the future. 
  Meanwhile, PJN President Diaz Cruz asserted his organization 
had decided to form an alliance with other political forces "to 
generate new, reformed criteria in the political position we 
will present to society." 
  Diaz Cruz added there are "mixed criteria and ideologies" in 
his party that unites evangelical sectors. Therefore, he noted, 
members of diverse political and ideological concepts can 
participate together. Diaz Cruz indicated his party is new, but 
he concluded by saying "it has great possibilities" for 
participating in the nation's difficult political road.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 24 Jan (AFP) -- Honduran 
President-elect Carlos Roberto Reina today announced the members 
of the cabinet with which he will promote his "moral revolution" 
in the next four years. Reina will be taking office on 27 
January to replace Rafael Callejas. Reina's government team is 
a mixture of progressive intellectuals, former university 
professors, conservative businessmen, and politicians. 
  Guillermo Bueno, a prominent financial administrator and 
former president of the Honduran Central Bank during military 
governments, will be Reina's presidential economic adviser and 
coordinator of the economic cabinet. 
  The intellectuals include Ernesto Paz Aguilar as foreign 
minister, Hugo Noe Pino as Central Bank president, and Guillermo 
Molina Chocano as planning minister. The three have not held 
government or business positions in the past. 
  Juan Ferrera, who until now has served as president of the 
Honduran Council of Private Enterprise (Cohep), will head the 
Finance Ministry, and banker Delmer Urbizo will be economy 
minister. The main economic advisers will be financier Jorge 
Bueso Arias and Dante Ramirez, former president of the Central 
American Bank of Economic Integration (BCIE). 
  Even though during his trip to Washington last week, Reina 
had announced a dialogue with the Armed Forces to appoint a 
civilian as defense minister, today he stated that this position 
will be held by Colonel Reynaldo Andino Flores. 
  Reina's government team is completed by former Liberal Party 
presidential hopeful Rodolfo Pastor as culture minister; German 
Aparicio, a close political supporter, as transport minister; 
lawyer Efrain Moncada Silva as government minister; Cecilio 
Zavala as labor minister; Xenovia de Leon, promoter of 
nongovernmental organizations, as education minister; and 
Enrique Samayoa as health minister. Attorney Ubodoro Arriaga 
will head the National Agrarian Institute (INA). He held that 
post during the Roberto Suazo Cordova administration (1982-86). 
The president-elect appointed his brother, Mario Reina, as 
assistant in the presidential office. 
  "I have sounded out all sectors and this cabinet is what 
best 
suits the moral revolution," Reina said.

<F P=106> [Article by Walter Hermosita] </F>
  [Text] Guatemala, 24 January 1994 -- Transportation workers 
have decided to take action, given the government's lack of 
response. These actions consist of paralyzing beginning 
tomorrow up to 100 percent of the heavy-transportation services, 
said last night leaders of the Fuel Transportation organization, 
which is grouped under the National Transportation Board, CNT. 
  CNT Spokesman Rudy Merida has reiterated that the government 
is being pressured on account of "several pending petitions, and 
if they are not attended to, the problems will be greater not 
only for the government but for the community in general. This 
is why the government should attend to the petitions, which 
total seven in number. Among the issues to be taken up are, for 
example, the customs problem--as it has a fixed eight-hour work 
day. Two others are the transportation cost of fuel and cement, 
given that these have not been brought up to date," he said. 
  "The four other problems are the interference--covered up by 
several mayors--of urban transportation lines in nonurban areas. 
Another is the Nonurban Transportation ruling, which has not 
been enforced. Still another is the ruling for the operation of 
international shipping companies and the problem of retentions, 
which are illegal and which are being collected by private cargo 
companies. These are some of the points this sector is 
demanding be discussed." 
  "Nevertheless, given that government authorities have 
expressed their incapacity to reach an agreement, the directors 
of organized transportation have decided to start staging the 
strikes as of 25 January, after noon. It is almost certain that 
the first to go on strike will be those who transport fuel, 
followed by other heavy-transportation services. This will 
continue until a total transportation strike takes place if the 
government, finance, energy and mines, and communications 
ministers do not meet with us this very day. We are giving you 
until noon tomorrow; if no solution is presented, we will 
definitely go on strike," said Rudy Merida, who made the 
statement.

  [Text] On 23 January three clashes between riot police from 
the General Directorate of Public Security and Traffic and over 
200 members of the Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD] 
occurred in Tlalmanalco, Mexico State. Sixteen persons were 
injured -- three of whom were shot -- and 15 were arrested. 
  The clashes occurred after a group of PRD members blocked 
both lanes of the Mexico-Cuautla road to protest the victory of 
PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] member Susana Plaza 
Aguilar during the 14 November election for a new municipal 
president. 
  Due to this incident, after removing the PRD members, 
surveillance was increased at the city council office in 
Tlalmanalco to prevent demonstrators from seizing the 
installations.

  [Begin Trejo recording] The federal government issued on 22 
January the Amnesty Law, which will benefit all those involved 
in the violent actions in Chiapas from 1 January until 1500 20

Gazette, became effective as of 22 January, and it has four 
permanent articles and two transitory ones. 
  Article One of the text contains the Amnesty Law, which 
favors all those against whom any legal action were or could be 
taken before the federal courts due to crimes associated with 
the violent actions on 1 January 1994. The executive

the law. 
  Article Two establishes that those who are either inside or 
outside of the country due to crimes indicated in Article One 
will be able to benefit from the amnesty as long as they release 
hostages and turn in their weapons. 
  In Article Three the amnesty permits the application of the 
law and civil responsibility [responsabilidad civil] of those 
who request it. 
  Those who benefit from the law cannot be in the future 
questioned investigated, arrested, apprehended, or tried in 
accordance with the terms of the current amnesty. The Amnesty 
Law will be published throughout the conflict area in both 
Spanish and the native dialects. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Samuel Prieto from the "Good Morning From Mexico" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] This weekend, Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for 
peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, admitted he perceives signs 
of exhaustion in his dialogue strategy with the rebel group, 
which have brought the peace process to a standstill. This 
problem, Camacho said, is reflected in three worrisome issues, 
whose adequate solution depends on continued confidence in the 
strategy and in renewed progress. 
  The first issue, he said, involves serious concerns about 
the 
proceedings implemented through the Amnesty Law for the purpose 
of making it increasingly restrictive. Camacho went on to 
explain that this is the key issue among many difficult factors 
in the conflict, and if it is not resolved it may lead to the 
loss of a great opportunity for amnesty and the return of the 
EZLN [Zapatist Army of National Liberation] nonmilitant members 
to their communities in a reprisal-free climate. 
  The second issue is a question: What is the agenda and, 
especially, how can national issues be resolved and the 
Republic's institutions strengthened without upsetting the legal 
order? Concerning this issue, Camacho Solis pointed out that 
amnesty contains guarantees for the state and society and, 
therefore, the cessation of hostilities is a condition for its 
concession. The requirements for the implementation of amnesty, 
however, must be imaginatively and actively fulfilled. 
  Regarding their agendas, which the fulfillment of the 
consolidation of the peace process depends on, Camacho said the 
regional agenda will, by and large, redefine the relationship 
between the Chiapas communities and the institutions. Changes 
must be made, even in public priorities, to devote more 
attention to the Indian regions. Meanwhile, the national agenda 
cannot associate the possibility of change within the country 
with the dynamics of an armed movement if there is to be a 
democratic government. 
  The third issue, Camacho stressed, is that demands have been 
made of him to explain the connection between his activities and 
politics. In this regard, he pointed out it is essential to 
achieve a political solution to this conflict to ensure a 
favorable climate for 1994. Everyone, he insisted, must execute 
the policies entrusted to him. Camacho said he will be 
completely devoted to this task as long as he can be useful.

  [Text] Mexico City, 23 Jan (AFP) -- The TENDENCIAS 
ECONOMICAS Y FANANCIERAS [ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL TENDENCIES] 
(TEF) bulletin said today that the political strategies to face 
the "Chiapas syndrome" (the emergence of guerrillas) "have 
already changed, at least partially, the economic outlook, and 
it would not be wise for investors to downplay or categorically 
deny the changes that have occurred in 1994." 
  The "weekly report for company management," published by the 
Expansion publishing company, pointed out that the government 
has established a strategy toward pacification which stresses 
reforms and dialogue." But the report warned about signs that 
"the government has not yet decided on a unified line of action 
and the skirmishes among political groups linked with the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI, official) and the 
government are reason for concern." In that framework, which was 
created by the emergence of the Zapatist National Liberation 
Army (EZLN) on 1 January in the southern State of Chiapas, TEF 
indicated that "for now the financial outlook seems stable and 
optimistic, but that unknown events in the near future might 
change this stability." 
  TEF specialists noted that current "financial analyses are 
underestimating the weight that political events are going to 
have on the economy during 1994." They pointed out that if the 
political strategy had "efficient and relatively speedy 
results," the government would have "a wide margin to maneuver 
to preserve economic reform and prevent 1994 economic policy 
objectives from being altered." They added that the economic 
objectives include overcoming inflation, encouraging a 
"microeconomic" revolution, and reactivating the economy in 
accordance with healthy public finances, stable exchange, and an 
orthodox monetary policy. They warned that "to change the 
economic policy in response to the Chiapas conflict would be 
suicidal: to throw overboard all that has been achieved, 
running the very high risk of causing political instability." 
  TEF analysts also believe that it is possible for Mexico to 
close 1994 with a 6.5-percent inflation rate, 1.5 percent over 
official estimates, and with a 2.5-percent growth in GNP, that 
is half a point below the official figures. 
  According to TEF, there are skirmishes among "groups close" 
to PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio because of 
the importance that Manuel Camacho, the commissioner for peace 
and reconciliation in Chiapas who was one of Colosio's rivals 
for the PRI nomination, now has. TEF added that there is "clear 
evidence of conflict in government circles between 'doves' 
(conciliators) and 'hawks' (intransigents), not only regarding 
the Chiapas conflict, but regarding whether or not there should 
be an opening in the political system. Which line will prevail 
and at what expense?" 
  The publication said that "it seems possible that, even if 
its definitive solution takes a while, the Chiapas conflict 
remains isolated in the national scenery and that an `epidemic' 
which might spread to other poor areas of the country is not 
likely. However, this possibility will be very costly and it 
will influence -- we do not know to what extent -- the political 
strategy of Salinas' successor." 
  President Salinas appointed Colosio as the PRI candidate, 
but 
according to analysts, following the emergence of the 
guerrillas, Colosio "has begun to `appear' as a weak candidate, 
and the skirmishes and pressures among PRI members are 
undeniable."

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on regional reaction to the GATT ruling on restrictions 
imposed on Latin American banana exports by the EC monitored 
through 20 January. Source is cited in parentheses following 
each item. 
<H5>  COSTA RICA </H5>
  Costa Rica today applauded the GATT ruling through Economy 
Minister Roberto Rojas who described the GATT ruling as a "great 
triumph for the region" He also voiced hopes that the ruling 
"will convince the EC to modify the import regime imposed since 
1 July" on Latin American bananas. Rojas added that Costa Rica 
has been in the vanguard in the struggle against restrictions to 
the banana market and will continue "to struggle." He, however, 
admitted that this struggle will be "as difficult as the one 
waged so far." The minister pointed out that he will work with 
his trading partners within GATT to achieve this goal. (Hamburg 
DPA in Spanish 2046 GMT 18 Jan 94) 
  The representatives of the National Chamber of Agriculture 
and Agro-Industry have termed the GATT ruling as important and 
historic. Executive Director Jose Carlos Barquero said this 
confirms it is possible to resort to this mechanism to settle 
international trade problems without undue influence from the 
political weight of the countries involved. He added that 
"because of this ruling, minority groups will have an 
appropriate base to face conflicts that affect them and involve 
powerful nations." (San Jose Radio Reloj in Spanish 1730 GMT 20 
Jan 94) 
<H5>  ECUADOR </H5>
  Diego Paredes, Jose Vicente Maldonado, and Mariano Gonzalez, 
the Ecuadoran ministers of foreign affairs; industry, commerce, 
integration and fisheries; and agriculture, respectively, during 
a news conference urged Latin American banana-exporting nations 
to "rebuild their damaged regional union in order to conduct 
negotiations as a bloc against the banana export quota system 
that has been in effect since July in the European Union (EU)." 
Latin America has been divided over a EU proposal to increase 
Latin American imports from 2.0 million to 2.1 million tons in 
1994 in exchange for the region's withdrawal of its complaint to 
GATT on the EU quota system. Colombia and Costa Rica, with the 
support of Nicaragua and Venezuela negotiated the withdrawal of 
the complaint in exchange for a more favorable distribution of 
the European quotas, but the opposition of Ecuador, Guatemala, 
Panama, and Honduras prevailed in the end because on 18 January 
the GATT rejected the EU restrictions on banana imports to favor 
banana producers in Europe and its former colonies. 
  Jose Riofrio, head of the Ecuadoran National Banana Program, 
characterized the EU proposal as a "scandalous bribe" and 
described the Costa Rican and Colombian Governments as 
"disloyal." Agriculture Minister Gonzalez announced that the 
Union of Banana Exporting Countries, UPEB, will hold a meeting 
on 24 January in Guatemala to "examine the GATT panel's 
conclusions," which he described as "positive for Latin 
America." (Madrid EFE in Spanish 0722 GMT 19 Jan 94) 
  Ecuadoran banana producers today accused the government of 
tolerating injustices because the country is not a member of 
GATT and other countries are representing its interests in the 
negotiations that are under way to counteract European 
protectionism. Ecuadoran Banana producers have proposed a 
change of foreign policy aimed at fostering rapprochement with 
the EU and to end the problem of foreign representation. 
Nicolas Castro, a leader for the producers, criticized the EU 
for its continued assignment of quotas despite the GATT 
rejection of its protectionist policies. Segundo Wong, 
representative of one of Ecuador's largest banana exporting 
companies, said the country "should intensify negotiations with 
the EU and exhaust every alternative for an agreement." Wong 
added that Ecuador should "aggressively" seek new markets 
worldwide, including European banana producing countries like 
France, Spain, and Portugal. The Ecuadoran Government on 18 
January rejected the EU banana trade plan. (Mexico City NOTIMEX 
in Spanish 0148 GMT 19 Jan 94) 
<H5>  GUATEMALA </H5>
  Guatemalan Deputy Foreign Minister Salvador Cohen warned 
today that the EU might disregard the GATT decision against its 
Latin American banana import quota system, which violates free 
trade. Cohen reiterated that Guatemala, the only Central 
American member of GATT, is pleased with the decision, but he 
admitted that "many GATT panel decisions have been disregarded." 
Meanwhile, Guatemalan Deputy Economy Minister Guillermo 
Rodriguez said that "Guatemala will not accept any measure that 
restricts free trade." (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2119 GMT 
19 Jan 94) 
  The Guatemalan Foreign trade Ministry has announced that the 
GATT on 18 January "flatly and categorically condemned the 
banana import system implemented by the European countries since 
July 1993." The ministry added that the system is 
discriminatory and cannot be safeguarded by the Lome Convention, 
adding that the GATT decision constitutes a "huge success" 
because it is very difficult for a small country like Guatemala 
to fight against a group of developed countries. (Guatemala City 
PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 19 Jan 94 p 8) 
<H5>  HONDURAS </H5>
  Honduran Economy Minister Carlos Chain described the GATT 
decision against the EU restrictions on Latin American bananas 
as a "success for all the countries in the region." He added 
that "the struggle will be difficult but the region will be in a 
better position to negotiate." Chain said: "Now the Europeans 
will have to approach us for negotiations and we will be in an 
excellent position." (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0146 GMT 
19 Jan 94) 
  President Callejas said the GATT decision to condemn the EU 
banana import system constitutes a victory for Latin American 
unity. He added that the Honduran people are quite flattered by 
the decision because "its represents a promising situation for 
the nation's banana industry." Callejas regretted the loss of 
banana plantations to floods and hurricanes last year, but said 
the GATT decision creates hope for the banana industry. 
(Tegucigalpa EL PERIODICO in Spanish 20 Jan 94 p 10) 
<H5>  NICARAGUA </H5>
  Nicaragua has expressed satisfaction over the GATT decision 
against the EU banana import system. Foreign Trade Director 
Oscar Aleman said "Nicaragua will struggle for the GATT council 
to adopt the panel decisions, which constitute a very important 
step toward the solution of the trade conflict." (Paris AFP in 
Spanish 2352 19 Jan 94) 
<H5>  PANAMA </H5>
  UPEB Director Enrique Betancur has confirmed that on 24 
January this organization will hold a meeting in Guatemala to 
decide on a common position against European "injustices" in the 
area of banana imports. The meeting will seek to design a 
strategy for Latin American banana exporters in light of the 
GATT decision in favor of their complaint against the EU. 
(Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1703 GMT 19 Jan 94) 
  Latin American banana-producing countries are celebrating 
the 
GATT decision in favor of the complaint they filed against the 
EU. Colombian Foreign Minister Nohemi Sanin, who was on an 
official trip to Panama when the news came, declined to comment 
before talking with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria. However, 
Panamanian President Guillermo Endara expressed great 
satisfaction, adding: "I knew we were right but I did not expect 
such a categorical decision." (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1214 
19 Jan 94)

<F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Cuban newspaper TRABAJADORES today said in an 
editorial that the key goal of our economy is to be as efficient 
as possible and that the most reasonable way to achieve this is 
by reducing costs, increasing productivity, and making the best 
use of the raw materials available to us. 
  In touching on the process of debates now under way in Cuba, 
TRABAJADORES said the basic objective is assessing the economic 
and financial conditions at each working center to evaluate the 
country's economic situation and the effects of financial 
imbalance in the economy. 
  The editorial stressed that with the authority they have 
earned by staying in their jobs, workers, today more than ever, 
are demanding high standards of labor discipline, because what 
is at stake is the defense of the genuine interests of workers, 
peasants, and students. 
  The editorial said that Cuban workers are concerned and 
reject the intolerable presence of crime, its ties to the black 
market, and its incidence in social and labor discipline, and 
the editorial demanded from the authorities the implementation 
of drastic and exemplary measures at all levels. It added that 
reality has forced us to make economic adjustments, which we 
will model after a socialist and Cuban pattern, using democratic 
formulas that are really unthinkable within other societies.

  [Text] Beginning this weekend in Camaguey, the workers of 
the 10 de Octubre Electric Plant will conduct an extensive 
industrial maintenance program to restore generation levels. The 
first phase of maintenance of the plant in Nuevitas will be 
conducted on unit No. 5, mainly in order to increase boiler 
efficiency. The workers at the plant, Cuba's second in 
generating capacity, plan to complete partial maintenance of the 
fifth of its six generating units in less than 25 days. Workers 
are preparing with minimum resources to begin an uninterrupted 
24-hour schedule in what has already been described as a feat of 
labor. Engineer Mario Mederos, director, stressed that this 
experience will make it possible later to perform complex 
maintenance on unit No. 6, which also produces 125 megawatts per 
hour. 
  The recent workers parliament meeting in the plant prompted 
an analysis of measures to reduce absenteeism, increase 
technological discipline, and promote individual incentives for 
work results.

  [Text] Beginning in February, education workers in Matanzas 
Province will analyze at the base level the need for rational 
exploitation of the work force in this sector and will advocate 
higher efficiency for teachers as well as nonteaching personnel. 
Without implying a reduction in educational budgets, workers are 
seeking solutions that would allow consolidation of classes in 
several schools, establish multidisciplinary principles, and 
fill the entire teaching and work schedule of the personnel. 
This will undoubtedly result in the elimination of a number of 
positions. However, according to preliminary analyses, only 
2,500 workers out of 22,000 will lose their posts. These workers 
will take retraining courses, sabbaticals, or other forms of 
education, including informal education alternatives, to 
maintain their ties with the education sector even if they end 
up working in a sector such as the minibrigades. 
  Ninety-eight percent of the children in Matanzas are 
enrolled 
in school, with one teacher for every 14 students in all grades 
and subjects. Highly developed countries have one teacher per 30 
or more students. The state budget for education for 1994 is 75 
million pesos; in the decade of the eighties, it reached 82 
million pesos, proving that education is a priority despite 
difficulties.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon; from "The Seven O'Clock </F>
News" newscast] 
  [Text] At the assemblies convoked by Cuban labor unions due 
to the need to reorder financially the country and to increase 
efficiency, workers have insisted on the need to unearth the 
causes of the insensibility of a group of enterprises. 
  During the regular period of sessions of the National 
Assembly of the People's Government, it was established that 
only 31 percent of Cuban state enterprises are profitable and 
that subsidies totaled 4.6 billion pesos--that is, 73 percent 
more than in 1989--during 1993. 
  Despite the fact that external factors are negatively 
affecting the island, it is a fact that efficiency must increase 
at all levels, and financial discipline must improve. 
  The subsidies to which some unprofitable enterprises became 
accustomed have an unfavorable effect on labor productivity and 
labor discipline [words indistinct], because in Cuba there is a 
very flexible labor legislation that does not contemplate 
different remunerations concerning each individual's 
contribution for a same profession. Things will change this 
year, at least as far as subsidies are concerned, if we observe 
the statements made by Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez, who 
explained recently that to grant subsidies, the financial 
situation of organizations and enterprises will be examined. 
The entities showing deficits will be forced more than ever to 
collect their accounts receivable, prior to requesting subsidies 
from the state budget. 
  Up until last September the business sector had 2.8 billion 
pesos in accounts receivable, a factor that results in 
difficulties and the ensuing diversion of resources. 
Authorities and Cuban unions are certain the irregularities in 
the collections and payments [words indistinct] enterprises 
generate discipline and [words indistinct]. As part of the 
people's democracy inherent to the indigenous social product, 
the unions will decide once more, however, [words indistinct] 
this time, it consists of overseeing in situ how the payments 
imbalance among enterprises are resolved. 
  Cuban workers [words indistinct] the battle of all society 
to 
reduce and eradicate unprofitability of a group of entities 
[words indistinct].

  [Text] In Cuba, approximately 30 percent of the fuel used 
for cooking is kerosene. It is estimated that there are 
approximately 3 million kerosene stoves in [word indistinct]. In 
1993 the consumption plan was for 464,000 tons of kerosene which 
amounts to $90 million on the world market, where this fuel is 
no longer sold. 
  Cuba cannot produce this fuel, so how do we solve this 
dilemma? The Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces's center 
for fuel development and research determined that a 
kerosene-diesel mixture was an answer for domestic kitchens. 
This became one of the outstanding projects of the Eighth Forum 
of Science and Technology. 
  After several trials, researchers concluded that the most 
feasible solution was (Jet A-1 turbo) fuel, a refined kerosene 
used in aviation. The average cost of (Jet A-1) fuel is $205 per 
ton, which exceeds that of standard kerosene. To overcome this 
problem the refined kerosene is mixed with diesel fuel, which is 
much cheaper. The researchers took steps so that the mixture 
would not damage the stoves [words indistinct] and would have 
acceptable thermal safety and efficiency. They decided on a 
ratio of 30 percent diesel and 70 percent of kerosene, which 
will allow an annual savings of $3 million, equivalent to 20,000 
tons more fuel for domestic use -- the amount that the 
population of Havana City consumes in three months. 
  The first tests of this research were carried out in 50 
homes 
with a 90-percent acceptance rate. According to Lieutenant 
Colonel Eduardo Perez Pena, more tests are taking place in a 
municipality of Havana City. The fuel should be available 
throughout the country by May.

  [Text] A 24 January editorial in the weekly newspaper 
TRABAJADORES stresses that every work center must draft measures 
to improve efficiency. The management of each work center must 
prepare a detailed economic analysis including specific 
proposals to improve operations. This analysis must be exact 
rather than saturated with unintelligible lingo masking the 
essential points. It is possible that not all centers have an 
accounting system that makes an in- depth economic analysis 
possible. The first measure to take in these centers is 
precisely the creation of such a tool listing the main expenses 
incurred per peso of goods produced. 
  Apart from the current difficulties, untracked expenses are 
due to disorder in place of order, confusion in place of 
discipline, indolence in place of rigor. Thence, the prime 
importance of discussing in the Parliament in the Workplace 
meetings the center's own operations and specific, feasible 
measures to increase efficiency. If a step forward is taken in 
every workplace, much can be gained by simply adding the effect 
of many positive steps. The TRABAJADORES editorial adds that we 
will see then the results of the general measures being taken 
nationwide, which can be truly effective only through the 
efforts of the individual workplaces.

  [Text] (Andres E. Rivero), first secretary of the Communist 
Party of Cuba [PCC] in San Nicolas Municipality, Havana 
Province, has announced that the PCC will pay special attention 
to economic efficiency in all sectors this year, principally in 
the production sector. (Rivero) said that in San Nicolas, like 
everywhere else in Cuba, economic problems are being discussed 
at the work centers and analyses are being conducted on ways to 
reduce subsidies to the management and budgetary systems, while 
producing more with the available raw materials. 
  The PCC municipal leader stressed that the PCC's attention 
in 
the province is focused on increasing cane production by 20,000 
arrobas per caballeria in the 1994-95 harvest. He said they also 
aim to continue the tasks of defense and recovery in 
cattle-raising, as well as the fuel conservation policy.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on 
Havana radio and television in Spanish between 15 and 21 January. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 15 January reports that a 
research biochemist at the institute for citrus and other fruit 
crops recently won an award from the Ministry of Agriculture for 
obtaining a set of reagents and a blend for the development of a 
reaction, the purpose of which is to diagnose quickly and with 
96-percent effectiveness the tree virus called "the virus of 
sadness" [el virus de la tristeza] which causes great damage to 
citrus crops worldwide. "The Cuban reagent is obtained from the 
blood plasma of previously immunized laboratory animals. The 
monoclonal antibody is capable of recognizing this tree virus 
before symptoms are present. This allows one to determine, after 
a sampling, the rate of incidence of the disease and fight it 
effectively and more cheaply. A reagent for the same purpose 
imported from Spain used to cost Cuba $2,000 per milligram. Our 
product has a production cost of $45. The market is being 
studied with a view to marketing the product for between $800 
and $1,200 per milligram." 
  Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 17 January reports that in 
1993 
the Heroes of Playa Giron Contingent, part of the Union of 
Caribbean Construction Enterprises in Varadero, produced 50 
million pesos in tourist works despite a 35-percent drop in 
available material resources and electricity. The contingent is 
currently completing the Gaviota Cuatro Hotel. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1800 on 17 January reports that the Pinar 
del Rio Provincial Assembly has approved its 1994 budget of 198 
million pesos, to which Pinar del Rio Province contributes 82.7 
million. The state must contribute the remaining 115.1 million, 
which is approximately 30 percent less than its contribution in 
1993. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 18 January reports that the 
60th 
Anniversary of the October Revolution Enterprise in Holguin has 
completed the first ten Cubar-90 rice combines, part of the 60 
promised for delivery by July. The report adds that it costs 
$90,000 to build each of these machines and that they represent 
a savings of $900,000 for Cuba. Plant workers also plan to 
rebuild 120 KTP-2 sugarcane combines, according to a Radio 
Rebelde report at 0000 GMT on 20 January. 
  Radio Reloj at 2046 GMT on 19 January reports that the 
Mexican Government has donated 3 million notebooks to Cuban 
school children. 
  Radio Reloj at 2054 GMT on 19 January reports that 
Camaguey's 
Venus Beauty Institute in Camaguey offers beauty services to 
local and visiting women. The Venus Beauty Center also has a 
cafeteria and a well-stocked store that sells imported goods, 
which is "attended by competent workers who take in some $1,000 
daily." Reloj adds: "Appointments for services can be made for 
the same day or for six months later. Charges are based on 
incentive; after paying the state tax of 30,000 pesos, the rest 
is profit." 
  Cuba Vision Network at 2320 GMT on 19 January reports that 
the Isle of Youth Citrus enterprise has developed a product 
called (perquina), a chemical frequently used in the food 
industry. The product, produced from citrus plant wastes, should 
save the country considerable money. 
  Radio Reloj at 1500 GMT on 20 January reports that workers 
of 
the Victoria de Giron Citrus enterprise have harvested 1 million 
quintals of citrus fruit in the campaign which began in August 
1993. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 20 January reports the 
following: 
  More than 10,000 people in rural areas of Granma Province 
will benefit from a joint Cuba-UNICEF project to improve water 
management systems in rural areas. The project is part of the 
national action program approved by the Cuban Government in 1991 
to fulfill the agreement signed at the World Summit for Children 
held in 1990. 
  Unit No. 5 of the 10 October generating plant in Nuevitas, 
Camaguey, will begin its maintenance program on 24 January. The 
improvements should increase output to more than 400 megawatts 
per hour by 1995. 
  Under a biodiversity protection agreement, the UN 
Development 
Program granted Cuba $2 million, of the $10 million contributed 
by the United Nations, for the purchase of microcomputers and 
advanced technology for use at the environmental protection 
center in Ciego de Avila Province. 
  Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 21 January reports the members 
of the 1,553 sugar Basic Cooperative Production Units, 
independent farmers, sugar cooperatives, and the Youth Labor 
Army will work together this year to plant more that 30,000 
caballerias of sugarcane throughout the country. An effort will 
be made between January and April to plant 5,000 caballerias of 
sugarcane. 
  Radio Reloj at 2045 GMT on 21 January reports that Ecuadoran 
physician Jose Galindo has sent Cuba a personal donation of over 
$20,000 worth of medicines, hospital instruments, and similar 
products. "The physician will be participating in the fourth 
continental Latin American and Caribbean forum for solidarity 
and sovereignty for our peoples, which begins on 25 January." 
  Radio Reloj at 2059 GMT on 21 January notes that a meeting 
of 
agricultural sector union leaders in Havana Province has 
reported that cold-season tuber and vegetable planting is 
virtually up to date, with close to 1,600 caballerias planted as 
of 20 January. Sector workers have promised to plant the 
remaining 500 caballerias in the plan by 28 February. It was 
reported that 463 caballerias have been planted in potatoes, 2 
more than scheduled.

<F P=106> ["Our Opinion" commentary by Eduardo Dimas] </F>
  [Text] Frankly, even though many U.S. politicians would 
like to become president of the United States, it must not be a 
very easy job to carry out for four or eight years, according to 
one's charisma and luck. A Yankee president must make everyone 
happy. He must benefit the strong, and obtain the votes of the 
weak; make concessions to senators and representatives who 
defend opposing interests; always smile and give a good image of 
a democratic man, which in many cases has nothing to do with his 
political ideas. He must also adapt himself to the workings of 
Washington, which has more than 200 years of experience and 
tradition. 
  That situation explains why almost all U.S. presidents have 
more success with foreign affairs than with domestic policies. 
When they do not achieve even that, they are practically 
banished, as in the case of Jimmy Carter, who is not even 
invited to speak at Democratic Party conventions. 
  Another thing that could happen is what happened to George 
Bush. Bush harvested victories in foreign policies, many of 
which were not directly his own. We could mention the collapse 
of the socialist bloc, the Panama invasion, the Gulf War, et 
cetera, but despite all that, he was not reelected in the 1992 
elections. The domestic economy played a dirty trick on him: The 
country entered a recession and he lost. An almost unknown 
Democratic governor from Arkansas named William Clinton took the 
White House, which he has now occupied for approximately a year. 
  Clinton has not been the exception, and during his first 
year 
in office, achieved more success with foreign affairs than with 
domestic policies. This is logical: The challenges that any U.S. 
president today faces are greater inside the country than 
abroad. On the foreign plane, Clinton has achieved the 
Israeli-Palestinian peace treaty; ratification of the Free Trade 
agreement; a favorable solution for the United States in the 
Uruguay Round's General Accord on Tariffs and Trade [GATT]; and, 
just recently, was able to get NATO to accept and control the 
former members of the Warsaw Pact; the Ukraine to commit itself 
to eliminating its nuclear weapons; Belarus to continue in that 
process; and Syria agree to negotiate an effective peace 
agreement with Israel. 
  All these achievements indicate a strong foreign policy that 
benefits U.S. interests and Clinton's image. Nevertheless, his 
popularity rating is very low. Could it be that the U.S. people 
today realize that very few dare to contradict the wishes of the 
empire and that the victories are really not so numerous as they 
would like them to believe. 
  Clinton has acquired a budget from Congress that could 
probably allow him to reduce the deficit with time, but he did 
not obtain the $16 billion for the creation of new jobs at a 
moment when there were more than 10 million people unemployed 
and the economy barely showing symptoms of recovery. To obtain 
approval for the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico 
and Canada, Clinton had to make concessions to several senators 
and representatives. It is yet to be seen if he will obtain the 
approval needed for his health care plan. What is even more 
important is for Clinton to take the first steps toward 
revitalizing the U.S. economy, which is in need of structural 
change. 
  Personally, I wish no evil to President Clinton. He does not 
seem to be a bad person, but as with every U.S. president, he 
must play the game that the imperial "establishment" imposes, 
whether he likes it or not. Clinton has not been the exception. 
It appears from its attempts to discredit him, creating problems 
by accusing him of being unfaithful to his wife and of shady 
business deals in Arkansas, that the extreme right fears him. 
  His first year in office has therefore concluded with some 
glories and some sorrows. So far, he has proven to be a capable 
man within the system. What he does from this point on will 
influence his chances for reelection in 1996. Only time will 
tell.

  [Text] The first meeting of Cuban and U.S. educators has 
begun. The meeting is being held to discuss quality of teaching. 
Among the objectives of the meeting is to study comparative 
education in greater depth and to promote future exchanges of 
research and bibliographical information. 
  This is the first meeting of its kind to be organized in our 
country, having as its forerunners the Conference on Education 
in Cuba, held in Boston in 1981; and the 36th Annual Conference 
of the International Comparative Education Society, held in 
Maryland in March of 1962.

  [Text] Cuba and Africa are united not only by historical 
traditions -- the peoples of Africa have always supported the 
Cuban Revolution in the international arena -- said Cuban 
Foreign Minster Roberto Robaina upon concluding his tour through 
five African countries. Upon arrival in Havana, Robaina gave 
this newscast an exclusive interview. 
  [Begin Robaina recording] I think that a meeting with -- as 
we said several times during the tour -- that Africa which is 
ours because of that part of us that is also in Africa [con esa 
Africa nuestra por lo que de nuestro tambien hay en Africa], 
has, indisputably it seems to me, given them confidence, made 
them feel secure. And of course it has also given us much 
confidence, and made us feel very secure, to find that people 
are so interested in Cuba, despite so many campaigns and so much 
disinformation. And what great satisfaction is produced by being 
able to know what (?it always) costs. [end recording] 
  Robaina's tour through Africa, the first since he was 
appointed foreign minister, included Ghana, Angola, Zimbabwe, 
Zambia, and Namibia. During his tour, the foreign minister was 
received by chiefs of state and high-ranking government 
officials in those countries, whom he told about the current 
situation the island is going through. At the same time, he 
himself learned about the current realities of the said nations, 
which are also part of our history and traditions. 
  [Begin Robaina recording] (?The fact that) it is a meeting 
with the continent that most contributes a presence of 
supporting votes in whatever international battle Cuba wages, I 
think also gives it special significance. 
  I would say that it does not have as much significance -- 
regarding economic and trade possibilities -- as a tour of the 
area in which we live might have, (?because of the great) 
geographical distance that separates us; but I think that the 
interests that we have in common with Africa have never been 
tainted by purely commercial aspects, aspects of profitability 
and business. Rather, all the contrary. I would say that it is a 
tour that, above all, has a great deal to do with values and 
traditions; and, of course, possibilities for exchanges are not 
lacking, possibilities for compensated collaboration, a type of 
exchange which already exists in several of those countries.[end 
recording] 
  This tour is part of a diplomatic offensive for the purpose 
of explaining Cuba's situation and its plans for overcoming the 
current difficulties. 
  This is Rey Rodriguez, for the television newscast.

  [Text] A heavily attended and militant ceremony of 
solidarity with Cuba, organized by the executive secretariat of 
AALAPSO [Afro-Asian-Latin America People's Solidarity 
Organization], was held at the international press center's 
Havana location. Support for the Cuban Revolution was expressed 
by numerous representatives of national liberation movements, 
union and cultural organizations, and participants in the Fourth 
Latin American and Caribbean Meeting that begins tomorrow at the 
Convention Center. 
  AALAPSO Secretary General Rene Anillo Capote gave the first 
of the speeches at this ceremony for solidarity with Cuba, which 
was presided over by Jaime Crombet, vice president of the 
National Assembly of the People's Government. This open forum 
for solidarity with Cuba denounced U.S. imperialism's unchanging 
and systematically aggressive policy against our country, and 
the criminal economic and financial blockade.

  [Text] Havana, 24 Jan (EFE) -- Elizardo Sanchez Santacruz, 
chairman of the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National 
Reconciliation (CCDHRN), has charged today that individuals in 
civilian clothes brutally beat group spokesman Rene del Pozo as 
he rode a bicycle in a Havana neighborhood. Sanchez, who stated 
the attack was "carefully planned," told EFE that Rene del Pozo 
was beaten a number of times in the head, abdomen, and back, and 
needed to be treated for bruises at Havana's surgical hospital. 
  According to Sanchez, in the past two weeks, Rolando Pages 
and Elizardo San Pedro, two other activists of the most moderate 
group of internal dissidents, were the target of similar attacks 
"always under strange circumstances," and had to be taken to 
hospitals. In his opinion, these are "repressive and 
intimidatory actions by the Cuban Government's political police 
against peaceful citizens who want to express their disagreement 
with the continuous violations of civil and political rights."

  [Text] Hamilton, Bermuda, 23 Jan, CANA -- A referendum on 
independence for Bermuda could be held as early as August, the 
ROYAL GAZETTE newspaper said on Saturday. 
  And a commission of inquiry to examine the pros and cons of 
independence could be up and running soon after the House of 
Assembly resumes on February 4, official sources said. 
  Premier Sir John Swan quelled most dissension over a 
referendum at Thursday's caucus meeting. 
  But several United Bermuda Party caucus members were off the 
island, and he could face fresh opposition when the issue is 
canvassed again next Thursday. 
  Tourism Minister Jim Woolridge, who returned to the island 
on 
Friday night, could lead opposition to the route favoured by the 
premier. 
  One cabinet minister, Delegated Affairs Minister Ann 
Cartwright Decouta, has already resigned over the issue. 
  If a commission of inquiry on independence was held, it 
would 
be conducted in public and wide input would be sought, Sir John 
said on Friday. 
  Before the vote was held, legislation to allow it would have 
to clear the House and Senate (upper house). An August 
referendum could still allow a commission of inquiry to complete 
its work and communicate its findings to Bermudians. 
  The most recent commission of inquiry in Bermuda reported in 
1991 to examine and make recommendations for the fishing 
industry led to the government's controversial fish pot ban. 
  The only previous referendum in Bermuda was on capital 
punishment in 1990. Less than one-third of eligible voters 
participated. Of those who cast ballots, 78.4 per cent favoured 
retention of the death penalty. The referendum cost government 
50,000 dollars (US).

  [Text] Beginning this Monday [24 January], many 
congregationist schools in Port-au-Prince have decided to 
operate only three times a week: Mondays, Wednesdays, and 
Fridays. This decision was made by the association of the 
directors of those schools working in Port-au-Prince. This 
decision is a direct consequence of the shortage of fuel and the 
scarcity of oil product in Port-au-Prince. 
  We will later discuss the details of this news item, 
especially with regard to the closing of industries and 
businesses in Port-au- Prince. For instance, the radio stations 
in the capital last week began working on a reduced schedule.

  [Text] In Artibonite, especially in the area of Gervais, 
hunger is spreading. Our correspondent [Leonor Exantus] tells us 
that children are dying of malnutrition. 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] One or two children die of 
malnutrition every two weeks in Gervais. Located at about 30 km 
on National Road Number One, Gervais is in the fifth section of 
Saint-Marc, which has about 3,000 inhabitants. The population in 
Gervais is suffering from malnutrition, whooping cough, 
tuberculosis, malaria, thyphoid, et cetera, which every two 
weeks kill one or two children. Two years ago, the sanitary 
department of Saint-Marc held a vaccination campaign which did 
not seem to have reached the Gervais population. 
  Furthermore, there is no water in Gervais, not to cultivate 
the gardens, nor for drinking. It is only when it is raining and 
the river is high that the people in the area can cultivate 
rice. According to several peasants, they approached 
institutions including the Red Cross and the City Hall in 
Saint-Marc, which advised that they themselves are facing 
difficulties due to the embargo, and cannot help the people in 
Gervais. The population of Gervais is sending a call to the 
natives of Gervais living abroad, to Haitians of good faith who 
might help them. The people ask for urgent action because the 
children of Gervais are only skin and bones. If no solution or 
aid is given to the population of Gervais, fifth section of 
Saint-Marc, the number of children dying everyday will increase. 
  It should be recalled that in July 1990, a slaughter took 
place there, killing 12 persons, [word indistinct] houses 
burned, many missing animals. In addition to all of that, the 
embargo has created a miserable situation for the people of 
Gervais. 
  From Saint Marc in Lower Artibonite, this has been Leonor 
Exantus for Radio Metropole. [end recording]

said by Herve Leveille who criticized those who said they are 
not members of the national congress, which has established a 
government of public security in the country, [and who say that 
the government] is not legitimate. In a message published over 
the weekend, Leveille rebukes those who say the national

  Determined, we will come home to continue the patriotic

we will leave in place the office that conducted our works and 
helped us look inward so we could say no to the premeditated 
failure of an entire people. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde 
does not agree that the international community should increase 
sanctions against the country. According to Deputy Monde, the 
sanctions have never done anything positive for the country's 
crisis, have only made the rich richer, and the poor poorer. 
Monde asks the international community to revise its behavior in 
the Haitian crisis. 
  [Begin recording, in French] I think the international 
community has gotten off to a bad start with... [changes

community has not played the role of arbitrator. It must 
readjust its fire: Adopting further measures against Haiti would 
be a grave error, not to mention an aberration, because -- let 
us be honest -- the agreement was violated by the Army, it says. 
Let us accept that as a fait accompli. But Aristide also 
violated the Washington agreement even at the United Nations 
tribunal. No sanctions were imposed against Aristide. Why are 
there two sets of standards? [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] At the initiative of the Haitian Chamber of Commerce 
and Industry, several citizens have formed a committee called 
the National Committee for Mediation [Comite National de 
Mediation, CNM] to facilitate dialogue among protagonists in the 
Haitian crisis. The members of this committee present themselves 
as independents, in relation to Haiti's political parties and 
religions. The members of this committee include Carlet Auguste, 
former ambassador under Duvalier; Lamartiniere Honorat, 
presidential candidate in 1987; Georges A. Beaufils, former 
chief of cabinet of provisional de facto President Joseph 
Nerette; Daniel Supplice, former minister under Duvalier; Rosny 
Desroches, former national education minister under the National 
Council of Government [CNG], the first CNG having been presided 
over by former Lieutenant General Henry Namphy; and Franck 
Joseph, presidential candidate in 1987. Five other 
personalities, members of this committee, are Mrs. Odette Roy 
Fombrun, Georges Bailly, Marc Alex Guerrier, Sem Marseille, and 
Dr. Georges Michel. 
  This committee advised that on their first workday, they 
will 
first focus on precise topics: that is, immediate problems, plus 
management of the critical situation caused by the embargo. 
Secondly, they will seek viable options for a way out of the 
crisis. The debates on these topics will begin on Tuesday, 25 
January, tomorrow. They will hold an important meeting at the 
Villa Creole Hotel as of 0900. The points to be discussed relate 
to managing the critical situation, which is a result of the 
economic embargo imposed on the country. The debates will focus 
on the following topics: 
  1. Establishment of responsibility for the consequences of 
the embargo; 
  2. General, temporary closing of enterprises; objectives, 
time limits, and incidence; 
  3. Partial closings, reduction and rearrangement of 
political 
schedules, and dismissals; 
  4. Formation of a private-sector crisis committee; 
  5. Utilization of the foreign chambers of commerce and 
employers' associations as a means of pressuring the 
international community. 
  The third major point is that resolutions will be presented 
on each of these topics to facilitate a common stand within the 
employers' sector. Fourth, in order to facilitate the formation 
and adoption of the resolutions in debate, the president of each 
employers' association will hopefully be able to consult with 
his respective grassroots group in order to get a precise 
advance mandate. This note was signed by Raymond Roy.

  [Excerpts] Two meetings, in preparation for the national 
conference on 6 and 7 February planned by CARENA [Committee of 
Actions for National Reconciliation], received minimal response 
from the political parties. CARENA intends to gather together 
about 100 participants in Port-au-Prince on 6 and 7 February, 
including five representatives of the legally recognized 
political parties, as well as representatives of the 
socioprofessional and religious sectors. 
  The organizers' optimism is not dampened by the fact that 
most institutions have not yet designated their official 
representatives. According to Adyjeangardy, spokesman for the 
organizing committee, the parliament is ready to legitimize the 
resolutions of the CARENA conference on 6 and 7 February. He 
asserts that some senators have already advised CARENA of their 
intention to ratify all preparations for the conference, which 
should attract more than 1,000 [as heard] participants. [passage 
omitted]. 
  CARENA also asserts that the countries called the Friends of 
Haiti have welcomed its demand for postponement of reinforced 
sanctions against Haiti. CARENA is satisfied with the decision 
of the country's friends of the UN secretary general to 
favorably answer its request to postpone reinforcement of the 
sanctions against Haiti, while awaiting participation by all 
sectors in the national conference in Haiti on 6 and 7 February. 
  Contacts at the highest level have been made with the United 
States, France, Venezuela, Canada, the Vatican, the UN and OAS 
secretaries general, and the current president of the Security 
Council for this position to be adopted and maintained following 
the efforts of CARENA, which will continue so that future 
resolutions of the national conference can be executed at the 
national and international level.

  [Text] Kingstown, St. Vincent, 22 Jan, CANA -- The St. 
Vincent Government has announced a February 21 general election. 
Nomination day is February 4. 
  The announcement, Friday night, found opposition political 
parties well into campaigning. It also found the ruling New 
Democratic Party with an image problem, following the 
resignation of minister in the prime minister's office, Burton 
Williams. Williams said he had resigned last week, with 
immediate effect, because Prime Minister James Mitchell treated 
Vincentians with "utmost contempt and disrespect." 
  Political insiders said Williams was among three persons the 
NDP wanted to sit out the next general election. Williams, 
however, said he would try to hold on to the South Windward 
constituency seat he has held since 1984. The NDP has not yet 
said who would replace Williams as its candidate or whether 
controversial former trade minister, Johnathan Peters, would 
seek to retain his North Central Windward seat. 
  This month, Mitchell announced he was relieving Peters of 
his 
portfolio and placing him on leave until month-end. Peters has 
been in the U.S. since early December. He is reported to be 
sorting out problems with the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. 
  Fifteen seats are at stake in the election. Mitchell's party 
won all in the last election here, in 1989. Mitchell's main 
opponent is the St. Vincent Labour Party, headed by Stanley 
John. The NDP will also be up against political scientist Dr. 
Ralph Gonsalves' Movement for National Unity. 
  Opposition politicians have listed unemployment and 
inadequate housing and health care delivery among the campaign 
issues. A key issue is sure to be the state of the banana 
industry, the main source of foreign exchange here. The industry 
has been hit by falling revenue. The St. Vincent Banana Growers 
Association, which virtually manages it, earned just over 60 
million East Caribbean Dollars (one EC dollar = 37 U.S. cents) 
in 1993, down from just over EC99 million dollars the previous 
year. 
  There has been a sharp increase in the voters list. Late 
December, 1993, the electoral office put the tally at 66,598, up 
from 61,091 persons registered for the 1989 poll.

  [Text] Kingstown, St. Vincent, 24 Jan, CANA -- The St. 
Vincent and the Grenadines Labour Party (SVLP) and the Movement 
for National Unity (MNU) have formed an alliance to contest the 
February 21 general election in which the ruling New Democratic 
Party (NDP) will be seeking a third straight term. 
  A joint announcement by the leaders of both parties - 
Stanley 
John of the SVLP and Dr Ralph Gonsalves of the MNU - said 
Vincent Beache, a former trade minister and SVLP leader, was 
chosen to lead the alliance. 
  The alliance will contest the 15 seats in the House of 
Assembly with the SVLP providing nine candidates and the MNU, 
six. In the just dissolved Parliament, neither party was 
represented. 
  Despite formation of the alliance, the two parties will 
retain their identities "but will present a common manifesto and 
share a common campaign platform," the statement said. 
  "This agreement was facilitated by the "Concerned Citizens 
Committee", a group of prominent Vincentian business persons, 
professionals and members of clergy who have recently come 
together to ensure good governance in the state," the statement 
added. 
  John will continue to function as leader of the SVLP and 
Gonsalves as head of the MNU.

<F P=106> [Report by Linda Hutchinson] </F>
  [Text] Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, 22 Jan, CANA -- Trinidad 
and Tobago's Prime Minister Patrick Manning on Friday night 
announced a mini cabinet reshuffle which saw additional 
responsibilities for some senior ministers. The cabinet 
reshuffle followed the resignation of Trade, Industry and 
Tourism Minister Brian Kuei Tung who at the beginning of the 
month said he wanted to pursue other career options. 
  In the reshuffle, Junior Finance Minister Ken Valley, who is 
considered to be one of the most productive ministers in the 
government, will now have additional responsibilities for trade 
and industry. The local government ministry which was handled by 
Valley was shifted to the minister of works and transport, Colm 
Imbert. Finance Minister Wendell Mottley was given the 
additional portfolio of the tourism ministry. 
  In addition, Manning announced the creation of a Ministry of 
Social Development which will be handled by Senator Camille 
Regis- Robinson, who will continue as minister in the office of 
the prime minister. 
  In a wide-ranging address to the nation, in which he raised 
concerns about the upsurge in violent crime and gave an up-date 
about the state of the economy, Manning said in the rebuilding 
of the country's economy, government has to devote time to the 
details of tourism and agricultural promotion. 
  "As we make this shift, we found it necessary to make some 
corresponding organisational adjustments in the government," he 
said. "Mr Brian Kuei Tung, the minister of trade, industry and 
tourism leaves the government (on Friday). I would like to thank 
him for the tremendous effort that he has exerted in the 
discharge of his responsibilities over the last two years and to 
wish him well in his new pursuits. 
  "In accordance with the government's priorities for the 
development of the tourism sector in the context of job creation 
and the need to accelerate the process of streamlining 
administrative procedures to attract greater levels of 
investment, there will now be a separate Ministry of Tourism." 
  Expressing concern about crime in the country, which he 
described as "callous brutality," the prime minister announced 
that from Monday, members of the Defence Force will be brought 
out onto the streets on foot patrol. 
  "The government feels justified in taking this course of 
action in the light of the anxiety of citizens over the 
situation." 
  Manning also said that in seeking to make the operations of 
the police more efficient, cabinet has accepted proposals which 
envisage the establishment of a nine-person police service board 
of management appointed by the president after consultation with 
the government and opposition. 
  The minister of national security, the police service 
commission, and the commissioner of police in recent times had 
become embroiled in an issue involving the discipline of police 
officers. Manning said that opposition leader Basdeo Panday was 
informed of the proposal and government now awaits a reply. "The 
board will have the authority to manage the police service and 
to deal with the recruitment of all levels of police personnel 
from the rank of constable to the rank of assistant 
commissioner," said Manning. 
  "The commissioner of police will be responsible for the 
discipline of officers in the ranks of constable to inspector. 
The police service commission in this model will become an 
appeal tribunal and will also have the power to discipline the 
commissioner of police and deputy commissioners of police." 
  The proposal further envisages that both the police service 
board of management and the police service commission will be 
accountable to a committee of parliament. 
  "In addition to all of this, the proposals call for an 
appointment of an inspector of police service whose 
responsibility would be to keep the minister of national 
security up-to-date on the performance of the police services," 
said Manning. He added that disciplinary proceedings could be 
instituted against individuals in the service, based on reports 
from the proposed inspector. 
  Speaking on the economy of the country, Manning described 
1993 as being a "difficult year," which saw a double blow from 
low oil prices and falling oil production, while an 
unprecedented level of debt repayment had to be sustained. 
  "All of this translated into money worries which forced the 
government to cut back expenditure in many areas," he said, 
adding that through the sacrifice government had been able to 
lay a solid foundation on which to build in 1994. He told the 
nation that government was successful in diversifying the 
economy away from the exclusive dependence on oil. He said that 
in 1984, government's revenues were 42 percent dependent on oil, 
while in 1993, it was only 27 percent dependent. 
  "So that unwelcome though the present oil prices are, we are 
infinitely better able to sustain them than we are in 1984. Even 
so, the repercussions of developments in the oil industry remain 
too significant to be left to the vagaries of the international 
oil market. Whereas we cannot control price, we have some 
influence on our production," said Manning. He said government 
has been working with several mulitlateral petroleum companies 
in Trinidad and the local petroleum company to offset the fall 
in oil prices.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Salvadoran economic developments monitored through 25 
January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item. 
  Central Reserve Bank President Jose Roberto Orellana Milla 
reported that El Salvador is experiencing sustained, accelerated 
economic growth. Urban unemployment dropped from 8.4 in 1989 to 
8.1 percent in 1993, and 149,950 new jobs were created between 
1989 and 1994. Orellana said the minimum urban wage has 
increased to 935 colones a month and that public workers' 
salaries increased more than 22 percent in 1993. (San Salvador 
LA PRENSA GRAFICA in Spanish 19 Jan 94 p 15) 
  The Inter-American Development Bank representative reported 
that in 1993 El Salvador received $109.2 million, which is 
equivalent to 948.5 million colones, for development projects. 
The funds financed 32 projects covered by 16 loans, five 
concession loans, and 11 donations of technical cooperation. 
The IDB approved three credit operations worth $85 million and 
four donations of technical cooperation worth $2.86 million for 
El Salvador in 1993. (San Salvador LA PRENSA GRAFICA in Spanish 
2 Jan 94 p 13)

attitude in order to suppress groups that want to destabilize 
the state through violence. 
  At a news conference, the Vice President said violent acts 
could definitely create chaos before the referendum. These are 
censurable terrorist acts that cannot be tolerated and the 
government has a duty to punish the wrongdoers, he added. 
<H5>  The Army Rules Out Existence of Urban Guerrilla Force </H5>
  Army spokesman Edith Vargas de Marroquin denied the 
existence 
of an urban guerrilla force, but indirectly accused the 
insurgents of the terrorist attacks carried out 18th Street, 
Zone 1, on Wednesday and in front of Congress Sunday morning. 
"These attacks were perpetrated as the Poor People's Guerrilla 
Army (EGP) celebrates its anniversary and it is unfortunate that 
in order to make their presence felt they affect the lives of 
innocent people. In addition, it is irresponsible, because they 
employ methods that endanger the population," she said. 
<H5>  The Government Rejects Congressmen's Allegations </H5>
  Presidential Secretary General Hector Luna Troccoli denied 
the allegations of several legislators who accuse the government 
and the Army of provoking the current situation. "These are 
absurd and irresponsible accusations, since not only the 
government, but the people themselves are asking for the 
legislators' resignations. Unfortunately, this is absurd and 
inhumane terrorism, since any differences can be resolved 
through dialogue," he added. 
<H5>  Violent Acts Have International Impact </H5>
  For his part, Government Minister Arnoldo Ortiz Moscoso said 
these incidents occurred a few days before the referendum, which 
leads one to believe they could be fueled by radical groups that 
do not want a change in policy. Ortiz does not believe the 
violence is being promoted by legally registered political 
parties, or by popular groups. Visibly irritated, he said "the 
[responsibility for the] blood spilled should fall on the 
wrongdoers." 
  He again pointed out that these incidents occurred at a time 
when the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) and the 
government are getting ready to renew negotiations to end the 
more than 30 years of armed conflict. Unfortunately, this 
affects us internationally, he concluded.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Guatemalan economic developments monitored through 25 
January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item: 
  The Bank of Guatemala president reported that demand for 
foreign currency as of 14 January totalled $35.6 million. He 
added that this fact could be the result of the present 
political uncertainty. The official noted that the exchange rate 
remains relatively stable. The Bank president also reported that 
international monetary reserves have gone from $738 million to 
$756 million this month. (Guatemala City PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 
18 Jan 94 p 62) 
  President Ramiro De Leon Carpio delivered 3.1 million 
quetzales to the mayors of Chiquimula in his recent working tour 
of that department. De Leon explained that the funds became 
available thanks to his austerity policy. The money will be 
used for public projects in the aforementioned municipalities.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria by </F>
unidentified EL TIEMPO reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [EL TIEMPO] The Council of State, through its new 
president, Magistrate Amado Gutierrez Velasquez, sent you a 
letter on Wednesday 19 January in which it requested information 
regarding the constitutional and legal reasons behind the 
presence of U.S. troops in different parts of our country. Is 
the president willing to give out that information? 
  [Gaviria] More than that. I have given instructions for the 
Defense Ministry to give out all the information it has on the 
temporary presence of U.S. troops in the country. The 
government is willing, as it has always been, to fully cooperate 
with the Council of State, not only by turning over documents 
but also by making the necessary explanations to clear up this 
matter. 
  [EL TIEMPO] As for the presence of U.S. troops in Juanchaco, 
why did the government not ask the Senate or the Council of 
State for authorization as the National Constitution requires? 
  [Gaviria] It is clear that the government believes the 
presence of U.S. troops or those of other countries that enter 
Colombian territory to provide technical and training assistance 
and that observe international agreements does not violate the 
Constitution. 
  The legal base for this type of exercise is the 
Inter-American Reciprocal Assistance Treaty (TIAR) which is 
currently in effect. It was signed by Colombia and approved by 
the Congress of the Republic in 1947. This treaty was followed 
by the Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement signed on 17 April 
1952. These types of military missions are carried out in 
Colombia based on legal documents that have been in effect since 
the middle of the century. 
  As for the joint military engineering exercise taking place 
in Juanchaco -- in which neither military personnel [as 
published] nor warships are participating -- there is a 
memorandum of understanding and an agreement signed by Defense 
Minister Rafael Pardo and U.S. Ambassador Morris Busby on 29 
October 1993. These instruments lie within the framework of, 
among others, the TIAR. They specify that the missions will be 
joint military engineering exercises for training purposes, 
which will lead to the construction of various projects for 
community use. Other similar agreements exist. One of them has 
to do with the exchange of military personnel, another has to do 
with the integration of the radar network located in the 
Caribbean, and another is aimed at expanding the naval river 
fleet. 
  Moreover, within the same framework of the TIAR, there have 
been various joint exercises with military units from various 
Latin American countries. We can mention the well-known naval 
operations called Unitas, 34 of which have already been held. 
They have been held every year since 1959 in Colombian 
territorial waters, as well as in other countries. Naval units 
from various countries are trained with regard to the joint 
procedures that would be followed in case of an attack from 
outside the continent. A landing exercise has taken place each 
year since 1962 at a place known as La Cangrejera on the 
Atlantic coast. In 1983 two exercises took place: one in Tumaco 
and another in San Andres. In 1991 and 1992 exercises took 
place in the vicinity of the Bahia Malaga Naval Base. They were 
joint exercises with the participation of U.S. and Colombian 
soldiers among others. 
  Therefore, by virtue of the fact that at the time TIAR was 
approved by the Congress, the Defense Ministry, and all 
exercises have been carried out on these same legal assumptions 
and never has anyone objected, I do not consider it necessary to 
request authorization from the Senate, or request the opinion of 
the Council of State, or inform any other authority, the same 
way it was not done in the past with Unitas and other similar 
exercises. 
  [EL TIEMPO] But do you believe Mr. President that the 
country 
is so naive as to believe that 150 men from the United States 
are needed to build a small school? 
  [Gaviria] Of course not; all these projects can be done by 
the Colombian State. But here lies the mistake. These 
gentlemen are military engineers and have come here to carry out 
joint exercises with Colombian military forces. The idea is to 
teach and practice, to share technical experiences, to solve 
logistical and communications problems, which eventually our men 
would meet in a situation of war. Instead of expending energy 
building or making useless things, they dedicate their energy to 
civic and solidarity objectives. The idea is to take advantage 
of the joint military engineering training and at the same time 
benefit the area and the community. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Does the presence of U.S. soldiers in Juanchaco 
violate Colombian sovereignty? 
  [Gaviria] The president does not see it that way. The U.S. 
military engineers are in an area totally under the control of 
the Colombian Navy and carry out their work under the 
supervision of the Armed Forces. I must also insist that the 
presence of military missions, doing civilian work, is covered 
by international agreements that are currently in force. 
  The problem is that many stories have been weaved around 
this. In fact, the EL TIEMPO Sunday edition highlighted the lies 
that have been used to attack the people's good faith. I have 
even heard that a U.S. base will be built in Juanchaco to 
replace the ones in Panama, or worse yet, that a new 
transoceanic canal is being designed. Good gracious! One needs 
to be very naive or very ill- intentioned to spread stories such 
as these that make no sense. 
  All this uproar leads me to wonder that once studies are 
completed, which both the Council of State and the Prosecutor 
General's Office are doing, the country must reflect and decide 
whether or not it wants this type of assistance in the future. 
My personal opinion is that if one believes that this type of 
assistance is an affront to our sovereignty, one is closing the 
door on something that is basic to making our Armed Forces more 
professional. Not only that, but we would end cooperation, 
equipment supply, maintenance, and intelligence that allow us to 
fight crime. 
  [EL TIEMPO] President, but Juanchaco is not the only case. 
What were the U.S. planes that overflew Barranquilla this 
weekend up to? 
  [Gaviria] According to what the Military Forces General 
Command and the FAC [Colombian Air Force] reported to me, the 
weekend Barranquilla overflights had been legally authorized 
earlier. The Civil Aeronautics Board, through the Directorate 
of Air Operations, had information on the Atlantic coast areas 
that this type of aircraft was going to overfly. 
  Colombia, in its fight against drug trafficking, receives 
support from the United States and other countries. We do not 
have all the equipment or the required technology to support 
with technical intelligence the struggle against drug 
trafficking. On the basis of current agreements that seek to 
repress illegal drug trafficking, the Defense Ministry requests, 
when conditions warrant, the support of U.S. planes that are 
specially equipped to detect airplanes that have not filed a 
flight plan. It is worth mentioning that overflights by U.S. 
airplanes are authorized by Decree No. 1692 of 1992. The 
overflights are to inform the Colombian authorities on the 
presence of unauthorized planes and that any other measure, such 
as chasing these airplanes, is exclusively the responsibility of 
the FAC and other national authorities. 
  You might be asking yourselves why the air traffic 
controllers did not know? Because there are ongoing 
investigations of air controllers involved in drug trafficking. 
There are also people who are interested in stirring up false 
sovereignty debates, encouraged by dark sponsor. 
  If we are concerned about defending our air space 
sovereignty, the true threat does not lie in joint operations 
with the help of friendly countries. Danger to sovereignty, to 
Colombian society, and air security arise with the hundreds of 
illegal flights, without flight plans, and with perverse 
motivations, carried out by gun runners and drug traffickers 
over our territory. The authorized overflights are precisely an 
act of sovereignty to prevent our air space from being used with 
impunity by Colombia's true enemies. 
  [EL TIEMPO] How many air surveillance radars has the United 
States installed in Colombia? Who operates them and who uses the 
information they collect? 
  [Gaviria] Currently, the United States has installed four 
radars. The locations, facilities, and equipment are under the 
command, operation, and responsibility of Colombian military 
authorities. Some operate with the technical assistance of U.S. 
civilian organizations, and others with the technical assistance 
of U.S. military personnel. The radars' purpose is precisely 
what I talked to you about earlier -- that is, to use technical 
means to enforce control, surveillance, and sovereignty. The 
information gathered is at the disposal of the Colombian Armed 
Forces, which uses it to plan operations. Colombia has always 
pressed the international community to obtain more equipment, 
which serves to enhance our intelligence work. I wish we had 
more radars and more technical assistance in these matters. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Some days ago, you said the U.S. military 
operation in Juanchaco was "humanitarian" in nature. Do you 
still feel that way? 
  [Gaviria] To be precise, I would be more accurate to talk of 
it as a solidarity or civic operation. I feel that building a 
hospital or a school, like the U.S. military engineers are 
doing, as a by-product of the joint exercise is a task that 
entails goodwill, and as the Juanchaco residents have said, it 
benefits the people of the zone where it occurs. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Is there any relation between the war against 
the 
Cali Cartel and the Juanchaco operation? Do the military 
operations in Juanchaco include building and operating radio 
beacons that seek to control drug trafficking? 
  [Gaviria] I believe I have stated with sufficient clarity 
that the Juanchaco activities, which stem from the memoranda of 
agreement and understanding signed between Defense Minister 
Rafael Pardo and U.S. Ambassador Busby, have no other purpose 
than the one announced: the joint implementation of military 
engineering projects based on reciprocal assistance treaties. 
Moreover, in view of the evident needs of the people of that 
area of the country, the Defense Ministry and the Valle 
Department Governor's Office signed a contract last December to 
build a landing strip in Juanchaco. The Codazzi Military 
Engineers Battalion is implementing that project. Although this 
project is being carried out simultaneously with the ones 
mentioned earlier, it has no connection with the project the 
U.S. soldiers are implementing. 
  All of this falls within the framework of the Colombian 
Constitution and laws. Some people, who are doubtful, have 
legitimate concerns. Others, who vehemently defend the notion of 
a U.S. invasion, are espousing a false nationalism that comes 
from bad information or shady interests. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Why have there been so many contradictions, so 
much secrecy, so much mystery in the handling of this case? 
  [Gaviria] No. There has not been any of that. From the 
start, 
I reported the activities going on in Juanchaco. If you compare 
the information the government issued in December to current 
information, it is exactly the same. The public is aware of the 
scope of the operation. Armed Forces officers have been ready to 
speak with reporters, and some reporters have even visited the 
site. As I said, I think it is legitimate that doubts and 
questions are expressed at political and public opinion levels, 
and the government has the obligation to answer them. I also 
think, however, the country is the victim of an exacerbated and 
ill-intended distortion of events. I am not ruling out the 
existence of a misinformation campaign aimed at creating 
sentiment against international cooperation in the struggle 
against drug trafficking. 
  In the past, drug traffickers have manipulated a false sense 
of nationalism to undermine the nation's purpose of ridding 
itself from the slavery that criminal organizations have tried 
to impose on it. We cannot be stooges for those who hide behind 
our flag to evade the law and protect their illicit businesses. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Last week's issue of SEMANA referred to a 
conversation with Prosecutor Gustavo de Greiff and U.S. Attorney 
General Janet Reno, in which the possibility of pardoning the 
members of the Cali Cartel was mentioned. How do you feel about 
it? 
  [Gaviria] Regarding your question, the country knows we are 
studying the topic either through consultations between 
presidents or contacts the foreign minister has made. We will 
make a decision at an opportune time. A decision will respond to 
the interests of Colombia and America. 
  Concerning the private conversation between the prosecutor 
general and Ms. Reno, I must inform you that the information I 
have is quite different from that published in the weekly in 
question. Never, for example, was there any mention of the word 
pardon. A pardon is a moral and legal impossibility of which 
neither the president nor the prosecutor could approve under any 
circumstance. 
  For obvious reasons the president of the Republic cannot 
expand on the issues discussed in that private meeting, but he 
is convinced that the terms of the conversation differ from the 
reports that were published. 
  What must be stressed is that after that conversation 
Prosecutor General De Greiff and the U.S. Justice Department 
managed to settle most of the differences that had emerged 
during the process of legal cooperation, whereby the proof 
gathered in the United States against drug traffickers was 
collected for the Colombian courts. 
  Nevertheless, because I am already discussing this topic, 
allow me to tell you that the president of the Republic has a 
high opinion of the prosecutor general, who has become one of 
the moral pillars of our society. With his legal wisdom and 
administrative skills he has built the Prosecutor General's 
Office, which was created by the 1991 Constitution to establish 
system of litigation in our country. 
  Moreover, he has done much more than this. He has bravely 
confronted the threats of criminals who see in the prosecutor 
general a respresentative of Colombians who refused to allow 
themselves to be defeated and were not frightened by the 
onslaught of violence. The prosecutor works shoulder to 
shoulder with the president of the Republic and his staff to 
develop and consolidate policies, such as the policy of 
submission to justice, which has allowed a tangible reduction of 
the terrorist phenomena associated with drug traficking. More 
recently, the prosecutor has made progress in bringing to trial, 
sentencing, and jailing several criminals. 
  Of course, there have been times when we held different 
points of view -- in short, different opinions concerning the 
way to handle particular cases. Because of the good 
relationship that exists between the president and the 
prosecutor, and because of the need, which is acknowledged by 
everyone, to work as a team, these differences have been 
eliminated for the good of the country. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Are the differences the public perceives between 
the Presidency and the Attorney General's Office concerning the 
surrender process for the Cali Cartel real or imagined? 
  [Gaviria] They are normal within the sphere of 
responsibility of each of the institutions. The Attorney 
General's Office, on one hand, strictly fulfills the dictates of 
the Penal Code as it pertains to the rights of defendants. The 
government, on the other hand, also insists on implementing 
strict penalties and on granting the necessary guarantees of 
security to those people who surrender to justice. 
  I believe I share the prosecutor's views concerning the drug 
lords' eventual surrender to justice. Moreover, if one member 
of the drug trafficking hierarchy wants to adhere to this 
policy, he must be sent to a top security jail. Also, if he 
wants to obtain from the government the implicit benefits of the 
submission policy, he must cooperate with the authorities and 
confess. 
  [EL TIEMPO] The way these drug traffickers are being held in 
custody seems to be one of the reasons for disagreement. To 
what extent is the government's severity due to what could be 
described as "La Catedral Syndrome" [reference to Envigado 
maximum security prison in Medellin, also known as La Catedral, 
considered to be one of the most secure prisons in Latin 
America]? 
  [Gaviria] The government has learned from past experiences, 
good and bad. In turn, the government must make sure that 
members of society who surrender to the authorities do not mock 
the administration of justice. The only way to control eventual 
abuses is to keep the inmates in high security prisons, 
protecting their rights and giving them all proper guarantees, 
but also having them do their duties as inmates. 
  [EL TIEMPO] The U.S. Government reportedly has made 
statements and applied pressure regarding the Cali Cartel. It 
has also been said that a certain indulgence of yours toward 
Washington is linked to your campaign for the post of OAS 
secretary general. What have you to say about this? 
  [Gaviria] The United States is not the only one that wants 
us 
to work with the same zeal with which we defeated the now 
virtually extinct Medellin Cartel. Colombian society is also 
committed to this effort, with or without the international 
community's requests. Colombia must continue to firmly combat 
drug trafficking. Colombia must wage a life-or-death struggle 
against drug trafficking with tools such as surrender. I am 
firmly determined to maintain this policy. I have stood firmly 
against drug trafficking throughout my public life, when I was a 
congressman, during my campaign for president, when I took up 
Luis Carlos Galan's banner, and as president of the Republic. 
The suggestion that the president of the Republic's view of 
this problem is influenced by Cesar Gaviria's eventually running 
as candidate for the post of OAS secretary general is evil and 
ill-intentioned. The country is familiar with my position 
regarding drug trafficking. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Behind the probable surrender of the topmost 
leaders of the Cali Cartel and other drug trafficking 
organizations lies the offer of those who control a large part 
of the drug supply to the United States to dismantle the 
business. Apart from putting a few drug traffickers behind bars, 
is it not important for the government to dismantle a business, 
whose profits can run in the millions, and the country's most 
complex criminal organization? 
  [Gaviria] It is the duty of this government, the Prosecutor 
General's Office, and the Attorney General's Office to find a 
good judicial solution to break impunity and to have the leaders 
of criminal organizations cooperate with justice, go to prison, 
and serve sentences that serve as deterrents. If, in addition, 
their illegal activities are dismantled, I am sure the Attorney 
General's Office can negotiate sentences in accordance with the 
Penal Procedure Code. 
  In due time, the Prosecutor General's Office itself will be 
able to assess the cooperation of those who submit themselves to 
justice. This policy must be accompanied by the combined actions 
of the intelligence services, the public forces, the Prosecutor 
General's Office, and the Attorney General's Office against 
criminal organizations -- actions that will make it possible to 
dismantle their illegal activities and build up legally sound 
cases. 
  I want to go further, however. It must be crystal clear to 
the country that it is impossible to coexist with the mafias, 
either those that perpetrate terrorist actions or those that 
hide beneath a peaceful appearance. Every Colombian must be 
watchful to prevent a climate of relative complacency toward 
drug trafficking from leading us to painful situations like the 
ones we experienced in the past. I am sure this view is shared 
by the Prosecutor General and the Attorney General. Our shared 
objective is to rid Colombia of the criminal drug trafficking 
organizations. 
  [EL TIEMPO] In Thursday's "Counterescape" column, and in 
relation to the attempt on the finance minister's life and 
renewed guerrilla activity, journalist Enrique Santos Calderon 
questioned the military intelligence services' efficiency and 
the Armed Forces' capability to counter these attacks. What do 
you have to say about this? 
  [Gaviria] The Armed Forces have substantially improved their 
ability to deal with organized crime. In fact, we can say 
Colombian society and the Armed Forces are on the offensive and 
have been defeating subversion and violence. 
  A great effort has been made to improve the operational 
facilities of the Army and the police. Their numbers have been 
increased, and their members have become more professional and 
been given better equipment. In addition, the resources at the 
disposal of the state's security and intelligence services have 
increased in number and been reinforced. The results have been 
overwhelming. The guerrillas' military actions have decreased in 
number, their power to undermine the national wealth has 
decreased, and the number of kidnappings have decreased, among 
other significant variations in the guerrillas' behavior. 
  The dismantling of the Escobar cartel and the elimination of 
its leader, the world's most notorious criminal and drug 
trafficker, demonstrate the Colombian Armed Forces' ability to 
deal with organized crime. 
  As a result of the public force's permanent activities and 
the results obtained in the struggle against subversion, 
subversive organizations have been perpetrating terrorist 
actions to cast a false image of their armed power. In 
addition, in view of their complete political isolation, in this 
pre-electoral time they can do nothing other than perpetrate 
terrorist actions to make themselves known as an active 
organization. Nevertheless, and despite the serious events of 
this week, the guerrillas are clearly losing their emphasis on 
politics, and their actions are becoming more and more like 
those of a mafia or organized crime. 
  The attempt on the finance minister's life and the use of 
terrorism indicate the guerrillas' military weakness. We 
coincide with columnist Santos Calderon in that, to deal with 
these people in this new way, it is mandatory to keep 
reinforcing the intelligence services' work and, of course, to 
seek greater support for the authorities among the people. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Mr. President, when will the candidacy for the 
OAS secretary general be decided? 
  [Gaviria] Colombia's eventual candidacy for the OAS 
secretary 
general must be explained as a consequence of the reality of our 
international relations and our incorporation into the world 
community of nations, not as an expression of a president's 
personal aspiration. 
  As for your question, we are considering the subject, either 
through consultations among presidents or the foreign ministers' 
contacts, and the country knows this. We will make a decision 
when the times comes. Such a decision will respond to the 
interests of Colombia and all of America.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Colombian economic developments monitored through 25 
January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item. 
  Although construction has been the leading economic sector 
in 
Colombia over the past few years, during the first nine months 
of 1993 construction throughout the country decreased by 26.67 
percent compared to the same period in 1992. (Santa Fe de Bogota 
EL NUEVO SIGLO in Spanish 14 Jan 94 pp 1, 18) 
  The National Administrative Department of Statistics, DANE, 
polled 7,000 homes in 148 rural municipalities in the Atlantic, 
eastern, central, and Pacific regions of the country, with the 
following results: rural unemployment increased by 0.5 percent 
between September 1992 and September 1993, going from 4.4 to 4.9 
percent; the employed population in those areas decreased by 0.4 
percent, and the work force increased by 2.3 percent. The 
highest levels of rural unemployment were found on the Atlantic 
coast at 5.5 percent; the Pacific came in second at 5 percent; 
the eastern sector was third with 4.7 percent, and the area with 
the lowest unemployment is central Colombia (no figure given). 
(Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 15 Jan 94 p 1B) 
  Colombia's coffee producers are defying international trade. 
Taking advantage of a shortage of Colombian coffee abroad, they 
have decided unilaterally to raise the grain's price 
artificially from 0.69 to 0.92 cents per pound as of 24 January. 
(Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 
1730 GMT 21 Jan 94) 
  The Colombian Petroleum Enterprise has disclosed that thus 
far this year Colombia's economy has suffered a loss of $25,000 
daily as a result of guerrilla dynamite attacks on the country's 
oil infrastructure. (Paris AFP in Spanish 0043 GMT 21 Jan 94) 
  The Bank of the Republic announced on 22 January that the 
Colombian Government will no longer set the official exchange 
rate for the U.S. dollar. As of 24 January the sole index will 
be the Representative Market Exchange Rate, TRM. The bank will 
also suspend the issuance of exchange certificates, which will 
deprive exporters of exchange discounts on the income they 
receive from sales abroad. Finance Minister Rudolf Hommes said 
that although the TRM will be the sole index, the exchange rate 
will be based on supply and demand. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2048 
GMT 22 Jan 94) 
  Finance Minister Rudolf Hommes announced on 21 January that 
the national budget will be reduced by $462.2 million to avoid 
putting pressure on the exchange rate. He said the measure is 
also aimed at presenting a healthy budget to the administration

  [Text] The Fourth Latin American and Caribbean Meeting for 
Solidarity, Sovereignty, Self Determination and the Lives of our 
Peoples opened today with a call for unity among the continent's 
progressive forces, in view of the current neoliberal, hegemonic 
policy. 
  The opening was attended not only by Commander in Chief 
Fidel 
Castro, but by leaders of the continental coordinating 
committee; [Communist Party of Cuba] Politburo members Jose 
Ramon Balaguer, Pedro Ross, and Abel Prieto; and other leaders 
from Cuban mass and political institutions. 
  Over 1,100 delegates from all over the region are attending 
this meeting, including, for the first time, the Caribbean, 
Central America, the United States, and Canada. 
  As a sign of solidarity and support for this forum of the 
social and people's organizations of our America, greetings from 
various prominent regional figures and from regional workers and 
peasants movements were received at the plenary session. 
  Solidarity With Cuba: the Great American Task [source's 
subhead] We love Cuba because it is the star of dignity, the 
star that lights the way for the men of America; and that is why 
we are calling for continental unity and organization to support 
it and to hold imperialism in check. With those words, an 
Ecuadoran representative to this fourth Camilo Restrepo meeting 
[name of meeting as heard] opened today's forum session at the 
Convention Center. The forum ends next Friday, 28 January. 
  For his part, Brazilian senator Amir Lando called for unity, 
with a view to promoting a new international order, the basic 
premise of which would be solidarity among men, or else, Lando 
pointed out, the human race will watch itself become extinct. 
  For Cuba, Jose Ramon Balaguer reported at this meeting on 
the 
Cuban people's ability to come out ahead, and stressed that an 
important sociopolitical process is in gestation in Latin 
America today.

of the Carlos J. Finlay Vaccines and Serums Institute, attended 
the Finlay assembly -- part of the Parliament in the Workplace 
process -- where workers discussed the revitalization of the 
economy and domestic finances. Finance Minister Jose Luis 
Rodriguez stated in his address that research is not a state 
expense but an investment for development. In the meeting, the 
workers called for implementing measures least affecting people 
while most benefiting the economy. 
  In his closing address, Jose Miyar Barruecos, Central 
Committee member and secretary of the Council of State, stated 
that centers such as the Finlay are obliged to become essential 
pillars of the Cuban economy.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with the Reverend Raul Suarez, deputy </F>
of the National Assembly of the People's Government, by Luis 
Naranjo from Las Tunas -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Naranjo] Good morning, Reverend. 
  [Suarez] Good morning, how are you? 
  [Naranjo] Well, I woke you up early once again. We were 
unable to make the connection on Sunday [22 January], but here 
we are now. I want to convey greetings on behalf of the people 
from Las Tunas and from Cuba as a whole, who remember you with 
great gratitude. 
  Reverend, we understand that you and singer-composer Silvio 
Rodriguez have been invited to participate in a day of protest 
against the blockade in the United States. Can you tell us 
something about this invitation? 
  [Suarez] This invitation was extended by Teresa Gutierrez 
and 
former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who have planned this 
activity, first, to convey once again the international opinion 
against the U.S. blockade against Cuba; and second, to a certain 
extent, to stage a demonstration of support to the bill that 
Charles Rangel, representative from Harlem in New York, will 
submit within the next few days, between 10 and 12 February. He 
proposes free communications with Cuba, which would represent a 
blow to the Torricelli law, a law we have endured for so many 
years. The invitation is for me, together with Rev. Lucius 
Walker, Ramsey Clark, Teresa Gutierrez, and Bishop Gumbleton, to 
speak on the occasion. They want me to speak at this event. 
Silvio will support the cultural part of the event in addition 
to other activities they have planned. The invitation also 
includes.... 
  [Naranjo, interrupting] I would like to ask another brief 
question. Have there been any difficulties concerning the 
issuance of visas to enter the United States? 
  [Suarez] Both Silvio and I have requested visas from the 
U.S. 
Interests Section in Havana. At first, they said there would be 
no problems; but then they told me that my application would be 
sent to the State Department in Washington and that I should 
have an answer in three and four weeks. So, I am waiting for an 
answer. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Eduardo Luis Gonzalez, director of international 
affairs of the Secretariat for Drug Addiction Prevention of the 
Argentine Presidency, is in Cuba to discuss with members of the 
Cuban Committee Against Drug Trafficking the signing of an 
accord for the fight against drugs. This accord may be finalized 
within two months. 
  [Begin Gonzalez recording] I believe that it will be 
completed before the year is over. We expect to complete this 
accord in a couple of months. We are aware that Cuba does not 
have a drug problem on the scale of Argentina's but we believe 
it will be useful since the world is growing smaller; 
international tourism brings both advantages and disadvantages. 
The accord is a contribution we will like to fulfill. [end 
recording] 
  Cuba has signed similar agreements with 21 countries and the 
accord with the Argentine Presidency Secretariat for Drug 
Addiction Prevention and Fight Against Drug Trafficking is 
another effort of the Cuban Government to join international 
programs against drugs.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on criminal activity and related judicial 
actions in Cuba carried on Havana radio and television in 
Spanish between 18 and 25 January. 
  Havana Cuba Vision at 0100 GMT on 18 January reports that in 
what police are calling the "Caramel Case," two managers at 
Coppelia Ice Cream Palace forced workers to reduce the amount of 
the servings and were pilfering one of every two or three vats 
of ice cream, which they sold on the black market for 300 pesos. 
Workers who protested were fired. This pilfering resulted in the 
center having to close early and serving only half its usual 
12,000 customers a day. Steps have been taken to remedy the 
situation, the result of highly deficient organization. 
  Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks in Spanish at 0100 GMT 
on 22 January report that the National Revolutionary Police have 
arrested seven people in Marianao, Havana, for illegal 
acquisition of imported goods, i.e., 60,000 bars of soap 
obtained through impersonation of representatives of two bogus 
foreign enterprises. The soap was sold on the black market but 
an official who refused a 100,000-peso bribe alerted 
authorities. Marianao's Unified Vigilance and Protection System 
also deserves praise for its role in the arrests. Reporter Jorge 
Roco stresses that personal irresponsibility and faulty sale 
procedures caused Cuba to lose money instead of profiting, 
besides exacerbating the excess currency situation. 
  Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 24 January reports that nine 
100- pound barrels of margarine oil were stolen from the Siboney 
candy store in Playa Municipality by former worker Jose Miguel 
Herrera Jimenez and Ricardo Manuel Ruiz Silva, a worker at the 
National Geology Institute. During the course of the robbery, 
Herrera murdered a night shift worker. An additional 17 people 
have been arrested for aiding and abetting the crime. The oil, 
officially worth a total of 300 pesos, was sold for 3,000 pesos 
a barrel. 
  Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 25 January reports that a 
Havana 
court has tried two men for embezzlement at Bacuranao 
Pasteurizing Plant, which lost over 20,000 pesos. The accused, 
who have a prior criminal record, worked as port and 
distribution chiefs. The investigation revealed that one man 
received over 9,000 liters of milk to be sold in the black 
market. A police investigator stressed that it is very difficult 
to fight crime when those in charge of the people's resources 
have criminal records and work in distribution.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 25 Jan (NA) -- Foreign Minister Guido 
Di Tella will travel to Washington tonight. He will seek a 
definition on the proposal to transform the Falda del Carmen 
plant. It was reported that Henry Kissinger's consulting firm 
is interested. 
  Di Tella has scheduled a series of meetings to arrange the 
participation of President Carlos Menem in the summit of the 
Americas presidents with Bill Clinton, which still does not have 
a date, to discuss the supply of A4M planes with radars, and to 
discuss a possible association for the manufacture and sale of 
the Pampa 2000 plane. 
  The foreign minister will meet with State Department 
officials to hear concrete proposals for converting the Cordoba 
plant, following a U.S. offer of economic and technological 
assistance. 
  Depending on the answer, the Argentine Government will 
analyze other proposals by foreign firms, particularly one from 
France that arrived during the middle of 1993, and the alleged 
interest by Kissinger's consulting firm. 
  It was reported that the company of the former secretary of 
state has links with a mobile telecommunications firm that won a 
bid in the interior of the country and expressed interest in 
installing its headquarters at the former Condor-2 missile 
project site. 
  The sources told NA that Di Tella will ask the U.S. firm to 
define its position on the Falda del Carmen conversion plan so 
that the government can have "a free hand" to analyze other 
proposals which have arrived at the Defense Ministry. 
  The Argentine foreign minister will also meet with Commerce 
Secretary Michael Kantor, State Secretary Warren Christopher, 
and Military Affairs Secretary Anthony Lake.

  [Text] Hamilton, Bermuda, 25 Jan, CANA -- A key member of 
the ruling United Bermuda Party [UBP] has quit the party, citing 
moves towards independence as his chief reason for stepping down. 
  Lawyer Wendell Hollis, a former senator who lost his bid for 
a House of Assembly seat in last October's general election, 
handed in his letter of resignation to the UBP caucus on Monday. 
  "I no longer consider myself a member of the UBP," he told 
reporters on Tuesday. 
  Hollis said the Bermuda Government's move towards 
independence was just one of several reasons for his resignation. 
  "I am not in support of the way in which independence has 
been handled by government," he said. 
  "I also wish to resume a sense of political independence so 
anything I say won't reflect on the UBP. 
  "I want to talk freely on any issue without fear of 
embarrassing the party. 
  "I value my personal independence and I used to be quite 
proud of the fact that I was not affiliated with any political 
party." 
  Hollis denied any resentment or disappointment at not being 
reappointed to the Senate (upper house) after his election loss, 
saying he did not expect to get back the seat. 
  The UBP caucus consists of members of Parliament and adopted 
and approved candidates. 
  Hollis was the government spokesman on the environment while 
in the Senate. 
  His resignation came days after delegated affairs Minister 
Ann Cartwright Decouto quit the cabinet - but not the party, 
expressly over moves towards independence. 
  And Management and Technology Minister Michael Winfield 
resigned his post last Tuesday to focus on his business affairs.

  [Text] A group of legislators are proposing a decree that 
would grant President Aristide 48 hours in which to appoint a 
new prime minister. According to a document circulating behind 
the scenes in the parliament, a copy of which was sent to Radio 
Metropole, some deputies [word indistinct] propose the 
ratification of a decree advocating the implementation of 
Article 149 of the Constitution in the event that the president 
of the Republic does not appoint a new prime minister within 48 
hours. 
  These deputies also indicate that this prime minister should 
be appointed in compliance with the spirit of Article 148 of the 
Constitution, an article that gives full power to the prime 
minister and his cabinet in case the president of the Republic 
is indisposed. 
  In a letter addressed to the president of the Chamber, these 
deputies from the southern region request an urgent vote on 
their proposal.

  [Text] The private sector held a meeting today at Villa 
Creole. A representative of the employers' association indicated 
that after 15 February, the closing of businesses and industries 
will be inevitable due to the fuel shortage. 
  This employer said that the business and industrial shutdown 
is inevitable after 15 February because of the general depletion 
of fuel. Asking to remain anonymous, he was expressing his 
perspective during a meeting in a Port-au-Prince hotel. The 
meeting, for employers from the country's private sector, is 
being sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of 
Haiti, the principal employers' organization. During this 
meeting, the participants focused on the crisis, the options for 
a solution, and a possible general shutdown of the business and 
industry sectors due to the shortage of fuel and the high cost 
of production. According to this source's statements, the 
meeting also aimed to establish responsibility for the embargo 
and and sought international chamber of commerce support. Let us 
listen now to a live report from Rosthchild Francois, Jr: 
  [Francois] Good afternoon. The Haitian private sector has 
been meeting since 0900 at the Villa Creole Hotel in 
Petionville. The objective is to find a common solution to the 
crisis, which has worsened as a result of the oil embargo. At 
least fifteen employers' associations are participating in this 
meeting, which has been convened by the Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry of Haiti. In this meeting, which is being conducted 
away from the microphones and TV cameras, the participants are 
discussing the consequences of the embargo. They are also 
analyzing proposals formulated by various sectors on the general 
closing of businesses, and partial operation. The 
representatives of the private sector are also considering the 
formation of a crisis committee within the employers' 
associations. They will also try to use the chambers of commerce 
and employers' associations as a means for international 
pressure. 
  The meeting of the Haitian private sector has been going on 
for three hours at the Villa Creole Hotel and is presided over 
by the president of the Chamber of Commerce, Roland Roy. Some 
resolutions should be adopted by the end of this forum. We will 
keep you informed. This has been Mobile Unit 20, for Radio 
Metropole.

  [Excerpts] Some private hospitals have started to reduce 
their activities because of the scarcity of oil products or the 
high price of oil on the black market. However, we learned that 
the humanitarian fuel will be distributed free to public 
hospitals and sold at $1.20 per gallon to the private 
institutions in Port-au-Prince. 
  Thus, the fuel crisis continues to claim victims in the 
country's institutions. This week, it is the health sector that 
is threatened. Saint-Francois De Salle Hospital has decided to 
close its admission service and surgery unit. The hemodialysis 
section has also stopped working. This unit, the only center now 
available for hemodialysis which purifies the blood of patients 
suffering from kidney failure, can no longer operate because of 
the shortage of fuel. At the Saint-Francois De Salle Hospital, 
activities were extremely slow on 24 January. This 100-bed 
center is facing some extremely difficult moments according to 
its director, Doctor Sainphar Bontemps. [passage omitted] 
  The French hospital continues to offer full services to 
patients. The director, however, pointed out to us that its oil 
stock could be depleted by the end of the week. [passage 
omitted]. Mr. Martineau advised us that the French hospital 
intends to extend its admissions of deprived people. 
  At the Canape-Vert Hospital, services are being maintained. 
The manager of this 48-bed center says the hospital is affected 
by the shortage of fuel. Jean Craan states that he had to help 
colleagues who were facing urgent fuel problems this week. The 
director explained that the Canape-Vert Hospital could not in 
any event receive all the patients in Port-au-Prince in case the 
crisis worsens in the other hospitals. Jean Craan expresses the 
solidarity of the Canape-Vert Hospital with other health centers 
in difficulty. [passage omitted] 
  Questioned as to reports regarding a possible 
disqualification of the Canape-Vert Hospital in receiving 
humanitarian fuel because of the social class of its patients, 
Craan asserts that it would be a great mistake. He made a point 
of clarifying that the doors of the hospital are open to 
patients of differing social classes and that the hospital is 
approved by the state. 
  The hospital of the State University of Haiti is also 
affected by the shortage of fuel. The General Hospital is 
working with a reduced staff and oil products are being 
purchased at high prices while waiting for the humanitarian 
fuel, according to Director General Jean Boirond. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Basseterre, St. Kitts, 25 Jan, CANA -- St. Kitts and 
Nevis prime minister, Dr. Kennedy Simmonds, has appealed for the 
maintenance of law and order as opposition politicians prepare 
to step up their campaign for fresh general elections. Simmonds 
made the appeal ahead of Wednesday's start of a new session of 
parliament. 
  Simmonds went on ZIZ, the state-owned radio and television 
system, Monday night to urge restraint in the face of a planned 
protest demonstration by the St. Kitts-Nevis Labour Party 
(SKNLP). Simmonds said his opponents should pursue the 
parliamentary process and the courts to settle their grievances. 
  The Labour Party, like Simmonds' People's Action Movement 
(PAM), captured four seats in the November 29 poll but a larger 
majority of the popular vote. PAM teamed up with the Nevis 
Reformation Party to form a minority government. The Labour 
Party has been canvassing support across St. Kitts for a show of 
strength on Wednesday. The successful SKNLP candidates say they 
will not be taking up their seats in parliament, but would 
instead protest the swearing in of the minority government. 
  The installation of the government led to clashes between 
the 
police and Labour Party supporters on December 2. Prime Minister 
Simmonds said the police had given no permission for a 
demonstration on Wednesday and warned: "Those who break the law 
will be dealt with appropriately." 
  Referring to the December disturbance, which hurt the 
tourist 
industry, Simmonds said: "...We cannot afford or tolerate any 
similar disturbances now or in the future. We saw how quickly 
our country was set back and how abruptly the cruise ship trade 
dried up. Our economy is strong now and we need to keep it that 
way, but it can only remain so by the maintenance of law and 
order. But the Labour Party has threatened to close down town. 
  Dr. Assim Martin, one of Labour's successful candidates, 
said 
the price for freedom and democracy was high "and we are 
prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice, not just for ourselves, 
but for all the people. We are prepared and ready, just like the 
people of South Africa who will get the choice of majority rule 
in April," said Martin.

<F P=106> [Report by Rickey Singh] </F>
  [Text] Bridgetown, Barbados, 25 Jan, CANA -- Shrugging 
aside the threat of a new opposition alliance, Prime Minister 
James Mitchell predicts his new democratic party (NDP) "will win 
a third term" in St. Vincent and the Grenadines' February 21 
general election. The 62-year-old politician told CANA as he 
prepared to present his party's slate of 15 parliamentary 
candidates Wednesday night: 
  "No last-minute strategy of an alliance of convenience by 
the 
opposition parties can prevent us from securing a third 
consecutive mandate from the people of St. Vincent and the 
Grenadines". 
  The NDP's 15 candidates will be introduced during a rally at 
Victoria Park that officially launches the NDP's election 
campaign. 
  The newly-created opposition alliance of the St. Vincent 
Labour Party (SVLP) and the smaller Movement for National (MNU) 
[as received] will present its candidates on February 3, on the 
eve of nomination day, February 4. The alliance, announced on 
Monday, will be led by former opposition leader and leader of 
the SVLP, Vincent Beache. The 62-year-old Beache, a former 
long-standing trade and industry minister of previous Labour 
Party governments, brushed aside Mitchell's prediction of a 
third term, saying: 
  "Mitchell's contrived confidence is based more on 
emotionalism and hope than pragmatism and the realities of 
politics in this country today." 
  Informed political observers, however, say that while the 
opposition alliance could "certainly weaken" the governing party 
in the election, the NDP would take at least 10 of the 15 
parliamentary seats. Reacting to the calculation, Beache, 
opposition leader from 1984 to 1989, said: "We will surprise the 
cynics, and Mitchell in particular." He declined to say how many 
of the nine constituencies he thought the SVLP-MNU alliance 
would capture. He was optimistic about MNU leader, Ralph 
Gonsalves, a lawyer and political scientist, winning the 
North-Central Windward constituency seat, held by NDP's 
Johnathan Peters, until recently minister of trade. Peters' 
resignation, "for personal reasons," takes effect from 
month-end. In the 1989 general election, Beache and Gonsalves 
lost to Peters in the fight for the North-Central Windward seat. 
  For the February 21 poll, Beache will be contesting, for the 
first time, the South Windward constituency seat held by 
ex-Health Minister Burton Williams, who resigned earlier this 
month as a minister in the office of the prime minister, 
accusing Mitchell of "being too arrogant and contemptutuous of 
the people of St. Vincent and the Grenadines." Mitchell has 
dismissed specualation about "serious rifts" in his party 
forcing him to call the election. 
  "The opposition parties are grasping at straws," he said, 
"in 
seeking to make a lot of politics of the going, for different 
and personal reasons, of both Burton and Peters. It is not a 
problem for the NDP or me." 
  The prime minister said his party "will win on performance, 
our record of economic and social achievements, the quality of 
goverance, our concept of public accountability and, of course, 
the confusion among the opposition parties that now have their 
so-called 'unity' with three leaders." 
  Beache, referring to the "three leaders" comment, said the 
prime minister was "smarting from the unexpected electoral 
alliance. It is not a question of three leaders," he added, "but 
one leader of the alliance for the election, with the 
understanding should we win, as we expect to, I will be chosen 
to head a new government as prime minister while the SVLP and 
MNU will move to merge into a single party." Unlike the leader 
of the SVLP, lawyer Stanley John, and MNU's leader, Gonsalves, 
Beache is the most experienced political figure of the alliance. 
He lost his own traditional North Central Windward constituency 
in 1989 when Mitchell's NDP captured all 15 constituencies. 
  With a then 71-percent voter turn-out, the NDP's 
unprecedented victory that included the four constituencies 
labour had won in 1984, was achieved with some 66 percent of the 
valid popular votes. Labour, though failing to win a single 
seat, secured approximately 30 percent of the votes. 
  In contrast to Mitchell's rallying calls for a third term, 
based on constant economic growth rate ranging from more than 
three to seven percent over the past two terms, the opposition 
alliance is charging "deteriorating standards of living under a 
government with lopsided development priorities and arrogant 
leadership." The government and the opposition alliance are wide 
apart on the level of unemployment and the state of social 
services, particularly in health. Prime Minister Mitchell, whose 
government has consistently been given the "green light" on 
fiscal management by both the International Monetary Fund and 
the World Bank, has placed the jobless rate at approximately 20 
percent. But Beache said unemployment was "now at least 40 and 
possibly 45 per cent." He said the government diverted too much 
development funding to the Grenadines, Mitchell's constituency. 
This, he claimed, was done "at the expense of St. Vincent where 
the hospital is without drugs and where the government remains 
insensitive to the alarming incidence of drugs-related crimes 
and rising cost of living." 
  Mitchell said his governments had succeeded in keeping 
inflation at between 2.1 and 3.1 percent, improved the "general 
social and physical infrastructure, and created development 
projects in the Grenadines to bring this country more in line 
with the realities of international competitiveness in the vital 
tourism sector."

  [Text] Kingstown, St. Vincent, 25 Jan, CANA -- An 
opposition alliance to fight a February 21 general election in 
St. Vincent and the Grenadines will have to do some hard 
campaigning to win favour with the electorate, according to 
historian, Dr. Adrian Fraser. Fraser said the new group will 
have to sell itself hard to the electorate, since Prime Minister 
James Mitchell's New Democratic Party would exploit some of the 
questions about itself that the alliance has not answered. 
  He told CANA the alliance "raises more questions than it 
provides answers because one hopes that it has come about 
because of dissatisfaction with the state of things." He asked: 
"Have they been looking beyond the election?" 
  On Monday, the St. Vincent and the Grenadines Labour Party, 
led by lawyer Stanley John, and Dr. Ralph Gonsalves' Movement 
for National Unity announced that they had formed an alliance. 
The two parties will campaign on a common platform and share a 
single manifesto, but retain their individual identities. 
  Prime Minister Mitchell, whose party won all fifteen seats 
in the last general election, remains confident about a third 
straight win. He told CANA: "No last-minute strategy of an 
alliance of convenience by the opposition parties can prevent us 
from securing a third consecutive mandate from the people of St. 
Vincent and the Grenadines."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report from the National Assembly in Managua </F>
on talks between representatives of the transportation industry 
and the government; from the "The Nation Radio Newspaper"] 
  [Excerpt] This afternoon, the National Transport Commission 
failed to attend negotiations that the government opened with 
the four organizations that make up the National Transportation 
Council. The two transportation chambers and the two 
transportation federations -- Fetracanic [Federation of 
Nicaraguan Cargo Carriers] and Fetracolnic [Federation of 
Nicaraguan of Passenger Carriers] -- are holding a meeting on 
the second floor of the Presidency in an effort to reach 
agreements to put an end to the problems caused by this strike. 
Journalists outside the Presidency have been denied access to 
the meeting on instructions from the Presidency's Public 
Relations Office. The journalists, however, are waiting for 
results of the talks. 
  Nevertheless, the strike will not be resolved, at least 
today, because of the National Transportation Commission's 
absence. The vehicles that had been blocking the nearby streets 
were removed this afternoon. Talks are expected to be resumed 
tomorrow. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Managua, 25 Jan (DPA) -- Tonight, the Nicaraguan 
cargo and passenger carriers strike demanding economic 
improvements, which started on Monday, unleashed several violent 
actions in Managua's eastern neighborhoods where the residents 
erected roadblocks, lit bonfires, and blocked the main streets 
with vehicles. 
  After negotiations between the carriers and the government 
delegations failed, the climate of "peaceful actions" 
deteriorated into a riot atmosphere without police intervening 
to restore order. 
  Gustavo Aguiluz, spokesman for the powerful National 
Transportation Commission, reported that a dozen taxi drivers 
were detained by the Managua police and that one of them was 
even beaten in the confusing situation. 
  Parrales Vallejos Cooperative buses blocked the Portozuelo 
freeway in Managua's northeastern area. On several streets, 
bonfires blocked traffic and bottlenecked buses and taxis. 
  Tonight, the strikers closed off city exits to Leon and 
Chinandega and partially closed off the routes to the country's 
east. 
  It has been reported from Esteli that bottlenecks impeded 
free traffic toward the Honduran border. The strike worsened 
when the Federation of Nicaraguan Cargo Carriers and the 
National Transportation Commission decided to keep pressing 
their demands as long as the goverment fails to negotiate a 
reduction of prices on oil byproducts and other socioeconomic 
benefits. 
  The government has not yet clearly stated its position 
regarding the carriers' demands. Meanwhile, the strike is 
spreading and people who use public transportation vehicles must 
walk to get to work.

  [Text] Managua, 25 Jan (DPA) -- Managua police are 
preparing to clear the streets of barricades and bonfires that 
are blocking the free flow of privately owned vehicles. The 
obstacles were placed in the streets by demonstrating public 
transportation workers, who are staging a strike to demand a 
reduction in fuel prices. 
  Trucks loaded with troops were deployed following orders 
from 
police headquarters, which received instructions from Government 
Minister Alfredo Mendieta, according to reliable sources. 
  The transportation workers are surrounding those vehicles 
that form roadblocks along several roads. The demonstration 
could become violent after negotiations between government and 
transportation representatives have hit a stalemate. 
  [Paris AFP in Spanish at 0243 GMT on 26 January transmits a 
related 155-word, Managua-datelined report that says union 
leader Gustavo Aguiluz has announced that "two taxi drivers were 
wounded by gunfire and another was beaten." After noting that 
10 demonstrators have been arrested, the AFP report adds that 
Aguiluz "reported police excesses and asked for the Human Rights 
Commission to intervene." The report also says a local radio 
station "reported a shootout between members of different 
cooperative unions, but the station mentioned nothing about 
casualties or the reason for the clash."]

<F P=106> [Report by Gabriels Guevara from the "Extravision" newscast] </F>
  [Text] President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro today 
described the transportation strike as senseless, adding that 
this is a bad time to paralyze this service. 
  [Begin Chamorro recording] What do they want? Do they want 
to own their own vehicles or not? Would they prefer to work for 
someone else, as they did in the past? Today they own their own 
vehicles, which they obtained through credits that must be paid. 
How long have they had those buses? For more than a year. They 
were given a grace period of a year, and they are still behind 
in their payments. Come on, now, they must pay. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Finance Minister Emilio Pereira said these 
activities that disrupt public order prevent the country's 
economic growth. 
  [Begin Pereira recording] Each time we carry out actions 
such as these, we prevent the country's economic growth, because 
they can result in a loss of more than $1 million a day. In 
addition, we should not only think about how much we lose today, 
but how much we will lose in the future. Tourists will stop 
coming. There will be no investments or new jobs. [end 
recording] 
  With regard to the demands from the transportation workers, 
Minister Pereira said: 
  [Begin Pereira recording] Unfortunately, we do not produce 
oil in Nicaragua. Second, the price of fuel must be in line 
with the value of the dollar to maintain our reserves, to 
support our production and credit plans, and to promote new 
jobs, which is Nicaragua's main problem. [end recording] 
  Minister Pereira said the government is willing to find a 
negotiated solution to the transportation problem, but it will 
maintain its position.

<F P=106> [Government communique on the national transportation strike </F>
issued in Managua on 25 January -- read by Transportation 
Minister Pablo Vigil; live or recorded] 
  [Text] Motivated by a desire to guarantee the necessary 
conditions for normal activities required by economic 
development and demanded by the Nicaraguan people, and in view 
of the need to guarantee public transportation, free movement, 
and public order throughout the nation, the Government of the 
Republic of Nicaragua informs the public that efforts to review 
and resolve the problems in the transportation sector, in 
agreement with all of the groups representing this sector, have 
been fruitless because it has been impossible to get these 
organizations to sit down and negotiate with the government. 
  Attempts to arrange a meeting between the government and the 
five organizations yesterday at 1500, as well as today at 1200, 
failed to achieve joint solutions to the problems in the sector, 
despite calls for such solutions made by His Eminence Cardinal 
Miguel Obando y Bravo, the good offices of the president of the 
National Assembly, and the secretary general of the Sandinist 
National Liberation Front. 
  In view of the position assumed by these groups, it is 
obvious that an internal struggle for leadership prevents them 
from reaching a satisfactory agreement with the government 
authorities. Consequently, the Government of the Republic has 
decided to inform the nation and each of these organizations of 
the following: 
  1. To encourage production in general and overall public 
transportation of passengers and cargo, the price of diesel is 
established at 7.15 cordobas per gallon, which is the price that 
existed in July 1993. 
  2. Prices of the following products are frozen at the 
current levels until 30 April 1994: regular gasoline, kerosene, 
butane gas, and diesel, in accordance with Point No. 1. 
  Small trucks used for passengers and freight, as well as 
taxi 
drivers with active vehicles organized in legally established 
cooperatives, will receive a bonus of 1.15 cordobas per gallon 
of gasoline up to a maximum of six gallons per day. This bonus 
will be in effect between 1 January and 30 April 1994. The 
mechanism used to pay this bonus will be regulated according to 
what has been established in the September 1993 agreements. 
  4. [number as heard] There will be no charges added onto 
those currently established for the purchase of license plates, 
according to Decree 62-93. 
  5. The Construction and Transportation Ministry will form a 
commission with all sectors representing the transportation 
sector to draft a new general transportation bill before 30 
April defining the characteristics and duties of the National 
Transportation Council.

  [Text] Today President Chamorro decided to delay an 
official working trip to Carazo because of demonstrations by 
striking drivers. She had planned to visit Carazo, where 
drivers began demonstrations this morning. President Chamorro 
had been scheduled to inaugurate a few paved streets, some 
remodeled schools, and visit San Sebastian Basilica. 
  Just after 0800, Carazo joined the transportation strike as 
more than 100 taxi drivers blocked the roads coming out of 
Jinotepe, which affected 95 taxi routes in the department. 
  Currently, the government is meeting with four 
transportation 
sector organizations at the Presidency. Only two chambers and 
two federations that are members of the National Transportation 
Council, which was created by a government initiative, are 
attending the meeting. The drivers are discussing problems such 
as the increase in fuel prices and the repeal of laws and 
ministry resolutions that establish new taxes. 
  At noon today, the Los Parrales-Vallejos group of the 
National Transportation Commission broke off negotiations with 
the Chamorro Government. The strike is gaining strength. 
Drivers have incited violence and tension in some main streets 
of the capital. Since this morning, the union of taxicab 
drivers has deployed vehicles and sparked demonstrators in 
places such as the Senderi, Repustula 15, and Rubenia 
neighborhoods and in the Ivan Montenegro Market. Armed with 
knives, taxi drivers have punctured the tires of those taxis 
that have dared to continue their regular operations.

  [Text] Yesterday, FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation 
Front] Secretary General Daniel Ortega Saavedra met with 
Sandinist members in Leon and Chinandega, where they discussed 
the preparations for their convention in May. 
  Ortega told the rank-and-file it is necessary to restructure 
from committees within departmental municipalities all the way 
up to the National Assembly. He said if it is necessary to make 
changes in the National Directorate to recover the trust of 
members, it should be done. Ortega added that from now on, the 
FSLN's work must focus on paving the way to returning to power 
in the 1996 elections. He said Sandinists cannot allow 
outsiders who want to take advantage by pretending to be 
possible candidates because it is very dangerous and the 
rank-and-file must remain vigilant. 
  Ortega told Sandinists gathered in the [words indistinct] 
the 
National Autonomous University of Nicaragua that they should 
support the transportation strike because the government's 
economic measures are affecting the cost of living. He said 
violence should be avoided. He mentioned a communique, which 
has been attributed to an organization of rearmed individuals 
who call themselves the armed division of the drivers, and he 
said that this can be viewed as a provocation. 
  Daniel Ortega categorically rejected the presence of the 
U.S. 
DEA in Nicaragua. He said the DEA's actions of interdiction 
operations against cocaine traffickers violated Nicaragua's 
sovereignty. In addition, Ortega noted that the DEA's actions 
are very dangerous because at any moment, there might be up to 
20,000 armed men in Nicaragua under the pretext of pursuing drug 
traffickers. 
  In the case of Juan Pablo Cruz Laguna, Ortega accused the 
government of Honduran President Rafael Callejas of lying and 
being an accomplice. Ortega said that when Callejas came to 
Nicaragua, he already knew who had murdered Cruz Laguna, and 
Ortega criticized President Chamorro's government for decorating 
Callejas.

  [Text] Matagalpa -- Salvador Talavera Alaniz, a.k.a. 
Commander Esteban, and Commander Franklin [Israel Galeano 
Cornejo] met with Monsignor Juan Abelardo Mata Guevara, the 
bishop of Esteli, on 20 January in Los Arados community, El 
Jicaro jurisdiction, Nueva Segovia. The commanders told the 
monsignor that changes in government policies and in the 
National Assembly and the more subdued tone and policies of 
General Humberto Ortega have motivated the 3-80 Northern Front 
[FN 3-80] to change its strategy and renew its dialogue with the 
government. 
  Msgr. Juan Abelardo Mata and a number of priests from Esteli 
Diocese, members of Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo's 
Verification Committee, members of the Pro-Human Rights 
Association, El Jicaro Deputy Mayor Alba Iris Rivera Rivera, and 
Commanders Esteban and Franklin analyzed the sociopolitical 
situation and the changes in government policies. They decided 
to continue talks with the government and proposed new 
discussion points, among them a cease-fire and relocation of 
members of the Sandinist People's Army [EPS] and the FN 3-80. 
  Another point proposed by the group led by El Chacal [Jose 
Angel Talavera] is the incorporation of FN 3-80 members into the 
police force in areas where the front has a strong social base 
and the creation of programs and projects for remaining members 
to help reincorporate them into civilian life. 
  Other points proposed by the FN 3-80 high command include 
the 
discussion of a demobilization calendar. Demobilization will be 
proportionate to government compliance with its social programs. 
The FN 3-80 also seeks guarantees for the security of its 
demobilized men and their reincorporation into civilian life so 
they can continue their struggle in a civic manner through the 
Nicaraguan Resistance Party. 
  During the meeting between the FN 3-80 and His Eminence 
Msgr. 
Juan Abelardo Mata, the FN 3-80 said the two men described by 
the EPS as 3-80 Northern Front deserters are mere criminals. 
  Msgr. Abelardo Mata will take the agreed upon proposals 
before the government. The parties agreed to hold another 
meeting, but neither a date nor a place has been specified. The 
good faith of the members of the FN 3-80 guarantees, however, 
that they will not continue their armed struggle in the 
country's northern mountains.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Nicaraguan economic developments monitored through 25 
January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item. 
  Officials at the Economy and External Cooperation Ministries 
said that despite current government optimism and expectations 
for renewed economic activity in 1994, Nicaragua's economy is 
still perceived throughout Central America as the worst in the 
region. The sources indicated that conditions during 1994 will 
be determined primarily by the agricultural cycle and 
international cooperation, both of which show decreasing 
tendencies. Funds received from international cooperation will 
be used mostly to pay $250 million in foreign debt. Of the $250 
million liquid funds to be received as part of the international 
assistance package, only $70 million has been contracted as 
loans while $150 million is coming from the Enhanced Structural 
Adjustment Facility (ESAF) program. In the meantime, unions 
continue to protest government plans to privatize several state 
enterprises, including utility companies such as the Nicaraguan 
Institute of Energy and the Nicaraguan Telecommunications and 
Postal Services Institute. (Managua EL SEMANARIO in Spanish 20 
Jan 94 p 3) 
  Social Action Minister William Baez, Carlos Noguera, 
director 
of the Social Emergency Investment Fund, and Maria Hurtado, 
director of Small Business Support, announced plans to create 
approximately 28,000 provisional and permanent jobs this year. 
The three officials agreed that one of the biggest causes of 
unemployment in Nicaragua is the government's structural 
adjustment program. The same sources said that unemployment in 
Nicaragua is expected to reach 60 percent of the economically 
active population. (Managua EL NUEVO DIARIO in Spanish 20 Jan 
94 p 6)

<F P=106> [Part two of two-part article by Danilo Aguirre Solis] </F>
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] 
<H5>  Confrontation, Violence, War </H5>
  In the preceding article we said that the message the voters 
sent to Sandinism in April 1990 had two parts: their fatigue 
with war, and the siren song of economic abundance. 
  We have already discussed the latter; now let us look at the 
first point. 
  War of the magnitude it had reached at the end of the 1980's 
has disappeared, but the government can take more credit for 
this than the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front]. In 
fact, it was when the new government took office that the 
imperialist sponsorship of armed counterrevolution ceased, and 
it is the new government that is spearheading the dismantling of 
the army of resistance. 
  In this phase, Sandinism bears the responsibility for 
reducing the Army and its ensuing disputes, and it must stand 
firm in professionalizing the EPS [Sandinist People's Army] and 
the police. 
  However, it has not been possible to dispel fully the idea 
of 
some underground sponsorship of new episodes of violence, 
particularly as a good part of those outbreaks are to some 
extent legitimized by the justice of the demands. 
  So we must still go further in converting the Army and the 
police, in the eyes of the citizens--both Sandinists and 
non-Sandinists--into models of professionalism, thus erasing any 
doubt about dual loyalties and, through this process, firmly 
preventing this government from converting them into pretorian 
guards that will back arbitrary actions and revanchism, 
particularly in the case of the Ministry of Government and the 
police. 
  Finally, there is the behavior of popular organizations and 
their methods, an area where we sincerely believe we have not 
managed to eliminate some of the stigmas attached to us, stigmas 
that contributed to the 1990 defeat. 
  We have not yet learned to distinguish between the use of 
violence to stop revanchist violence and the socio-economic 
crushing of the people. Taking these methods to extremes will 
culminate in destruction or unnecessary troubles that are 
frowned upon by those whom we wish to attract to our cause, and 
even worse, will lead the government to wash its hands and claim 
to be victims of Sandinism, which does not allow it to govern. 
Despite the falsity of that charge, it cannot be denied that we 
are still viewed as combative and violent by the ordinary 
citizen, who subconsciously expects even worse clashes if we get 
back in the government. 
  We need to remember the resources that we control so that in 
any conflict, without renouncing our principles and our demands, 
we can make use of these resources, and so make our claims 
stronger and bring together the majority of the Nicaraguan 
population. 
  We know that improving our methods of struggle is a serious 
challenge in today's grave situation, but facing such challenges 
is part of the integral vision that a good politician needs to 
have. 
  Let us leave for a third part the FSLN's political work and 
its repercussions on the Sandinist grass roots and the people in 
general. That is perhaps where we have made the most progress, 
even though we continue to read articles about the so-called 
co-government, articles which contain the same amount of 
disinformation as in the beginning, and the same line that 
unconsciously blocks the harmony that must exist between 
political action and popular struggle. 
  In summary, perhaps we may also include in this next part 
other elements that affect this entire situation: the lack of an 
alternative, essentially Sandinist program; the issue of 
personalities in the leadership; and electoral expectations of 
combining those personalities with future presidential 
candidacies.

  [Text] Energy Minister Francisco Acosta today reported that 
the Ecuadoran Government and indigenous organizations have 
reached some agreements that will reduce the tension caused by 
the opening of the seventh round of oil exploration bidding. 
  Minister Acosta said a commission was created with the 
participation of representatives from indigenous groups, 
environmental organizations, Petroecuador [Ecuadoran State 
Petroleum Enterprise], and the Energy Ministry to monitor the 
development of the seventh round of bidding. 
  [Meanwhile, Paris AFP in Spanish at 0306 GMT on 26 January 
transmits a 380-word, Quito-datelined report that adds: 
"Delegations from several Ecuadoran Indian groups occupied the 
Energy and Mines Ministry in Quito on 25 January to demand that 
the government suspend the oil bidding process." The report 
adds: "In Quito in the afternoon of 25 January, there were 
clashes between the police and students supporting the Indian 
demands. Authorities, however, claimed there were no arrests or 
serious incidents during the protest."]

  The Ecuadoran Central Bank has announced that Ecuador closed 
1993 with $1.253 billion in international reserves, the highest 
level reported in the country's history. In a press communique 
the Central Bank said these figures prove the effectiveness of 
the government's economic policy because it reduced inflation 
and strengthened the economy's position abroad. (Quito Voz de

  [Text] A PRC trade delegation, comprising 10 businessmen, 
has been in Paraguay since 22 January. They are seeking to 
begin a more interesting trade exchange with Paraguay. Nearly 
30 Paraguayan businessmen are participating in the round of 
talks that began yesterday and will conclude tomorrow. 
  The PRC delegation is visiting several South American 
countries. They have been invited by the Paraguayan Stock 
Exchange and Business Chamber. 
  Xie Jianqun, chief of this delegation and vice chairman of 
the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, said 
they wish to acquire greater knowledge and increase the 
incipient existing trade exchange. During 1992, China purchased 
$20 million worth of Paraguayan cotton. 
  The PRC has 1.170 billion inhabitants and is a potential 
market for our products whose competitiveness will nonetheless 
depend on comparative advantages, mainly in the field of 
transportation. 
  Jianqun said his country has experienced rapid economic 
growth in the past few years following the flexibilization of 
its economic policy. The PRC has changed from a planned to a 
free market economic policy. 
  The delegation chief said the PRC last year exported goods 
worth $195.7 billion and is 11th among the most important world 
economies. The PRC imports a broad range of products from the 
world, especially food products. 
  He said the PRC's greatest South American trade partner is 
Brazil, from where it imports fertilizers, agrochemicals, and 
alloys. He said that they can buy anything that is offered to 
them, as long as the price conditions and other factors are 
reasonable. 
  Paraguay is the only country [as published] that has so far 
not established diplomatic relations with the PRC, which must be 
considered an important market for our products.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar today joined the 
entire Free Bolivia Movement [MBL] leadership in a news 
conference. The MBL top leaders met during the past weekend to 
confirm various points, of which the main decision is that they 
will stay in the government coalition. 
  [Begin MBL Deputy Miguel Urioste recording] First, to 
confirm 
the validity and correctness of the government's strategy and 
shared power decided at the First MBL National Congress of July 
1991, to promote a head-on struggle against poverty and 
corruption, and to implement profound state reforms. 
  Second, to reaffirm, after six months of governmental 
endeavor, the appropriateness, historic opportunity, and 
necessity to fully comply with the pact for change that we 
signed with the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] on 4 
July 1993, correcting our mistakes and those of our allies, and 
seeking to enhance the performance of the government coalition 
for the benefit of Bolivian society. [end recording] 
  The Bolivian foreign minister explained the MBL's belief on 
the type of country that we have. 
  [Begin Aranibar recording] This country has all the 
strength, 
tradition, and prospects required to progress. It is a country 
with tremendous difficulties, serious deficiencies, and 
insufficiencies. Nevertheless, with a government like the 
current one, with a president like the current one, with a 
coalition like the current one, and with a party like the MBL, 
we will progress. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Pedro Cardenas Pinto, 63 years of age, who is 
the father of Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas, is being held 
under arrest in the San Pedro jail for killing his wife Teudosia 
Alarcon de Cardenas. 
  Regarding the circumstances of this crime we have a report 
from the prosecutor, Victor Hugo Serrano: 
  [Begin recording] According to the police investigation 
Pedro 
Cardenas testified that on 23 January at about 0900, while he 
and his wife were on their way to Pocollita, they got involved 
in a heated argument. Unfortunately they appear to have hit one 
another and at some point, blinded by anger, he killed his wife. 
[passage omitted] [end recording] 
  Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas, who was noticeably 
affected by this event, had to face the media. He read a brief 
communique: 
  [Begin recording] There has been a tragedy involving my 
father, who killed his wife, Teodosia Alarcon de Cardenas. As a 
son I feel a great pain. This is a tragedy for both the 
Cardenas and Alarcon families. Along with my brothers and 
sisters, deeply grieved, I pray the Lord for the soul of my 
stepmother. Above my condition as son there is my duty as a 
citizen and official who respects the law and seeks justice. I 
leave in the hands of the appropriate officials the 
clarification of this event and the determination of the 
appropriate responsibilities, being aware that in my position as 
an official I will never allow this position of authority to 
prevail over or interfere with in the strict fulfillment of the 
law. [end recording]

Tancheita, Fidel Mendoza Paredes and Roberto Sanchez Sanchez, 
drivers of three Conasupo vehicles, were attacked by a group of 
armed individuals who took their money. 
  Likewise, employees of the National Immigration Institute 
announced that in that same area and on the same day Fernando 
Sandoval Flores, Marcos Espinoza Aguilar, and Martin Au Rivera 
were attacked by approximately 30 armed individuals who were 
dressed in gray tops and dark pants and had their faces covered. 
Their assailants robbed them of 850 new pesos. 
  Meanwhile, Jose Transito Burguete Najera reported on 22 
January that on 30 December he left 80 head of cattle at his El 
Jordan ranch in the municipality of Ocosingo and when he 
returned for them on 18 January he was attacked in La Nueva 
Estrella, a town in the same municipality, by 40 individuals who 
had rifles and were dressed in brown uniforms with large 
handkerchiefs around their necks. These men held Burguete 
Najera for 24 hours, demanding payment of 5,000 new pesos and 
four head of cattle. Since Burguete did not have the money they 
took four heads of cattle and a 3-ton pick-up. 
  On that same day Armando Aguilar Castellanos, owner of the 
El 
Porvenir ranch in Ocosingo Municipality, reported that on 20 
January approximately 40 armed transgressors appeared at his 
home and stole his pick-up. 
  The perpetration of these types of crimes is becoming quite 
frequent; this has been confirmed by Mr. Antonio Robelo, a 
representative of the state cattle breeders' association, who 
disclosed that up until yesterday in Las Margaritas Municipality 
alone, over 1,500 head of cattle have been lost. 
  Robelo also disclosed that the transgressors have [shot] 
several peasants in their backs for attempting to desert from 
the armed groups. 
  The NDS has received a copy of communique No. 007/94 with 
today's date, addressed to the president of the republic, signed 
by the municipal president of Oxchuc, Chiapas and by the 
following municipal representatives: secretary general of the 
municipal committee of the National Peasant Confederation, 
president of the Community Property Commission, and municipal 
agents and education committees of the 48 communities that 
comprise Oxchuc Municipality. The document requests that the 
Mexican Army remain in Oxchuc to maintain its residents' peace 
of mind and it denies the accusations leveled against our 
Mexican Army, which has proven its loyalty by restoring social 
order.

  [Text] Indians and peasants of Chiapas have converged on 
San Cristobal de las Casas for the Second Meeting of the State 
Council of Indian and Peasant Organizations [Consejo Estatal de 
Organizaciones Indigenas y Campesinas]. On behalf of dozens of 
Indian and peasant organizations in Chiapas State, Marcelino 
Gomez Nunez, a leader of the National Coordinating Board of the 
Ayala Plan, invited President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to visit 
Ocosingo or San Cristobal de Las Casas as soon as possible. The 
visit would allow the president to get first-hand knowledge of 
the situation from those affected and offer him the opportunity 
to encourage the people to find a solution to the problems 
facing them after the New Year's conflict. 
  The meeting between Indians and peasants and Social 
Development Secretary Carlos Rojas took place at a warehouse 
complex known as El Pajal on the outskirts of San Cristobal, on 
the road to Rancho Nuevo. Eraclio Zepeda and Andres Fabrega, 
members of the National Commission for the Overall Development 
and Social Justice for Indian People were present, as well as 
Rigoberta Menchu, Beatriz Paredes, and Jose Narro Robles. All 
Indian and peasant leaders and representatives repeatedly 
expressed their desire for progress through dialogue. The 
leaders asked Secretary Carlos Rojas to set up a meeting between 
the Indian and peasant organizations and Peace Commissioner 
Manuel Camacho Solis in an attempt to reach agreements that will 
guarantee justice in Chiapas. One of the more important 
proposals made during the meeting was the establishment of a 
produce wholesale program for the conflict area.

  [Text] Mexico, 25 Jan (AFP) -- The Zapatist National 
Liberation Army (EZLN) condemned former Chiapas governor Absalon 
Castellanos to life in prison but has decided to "give him 
physical freedom and, instead, sentence him to live to the last 
day of his life with the shame and embarrassment of having 
received the forgiveness and kindness of people who for so long 
a time he humiliated, kidnapped, dispossessed, robbed, and 
murdered." 
  In a communique released today to the media, the EZLN, which 
kidnapped Castellanos on 1 January, its first day of operations, 
announced that the "court" had sentenced the former governor "to 
life in prison, doing manual labor in an Indian community in 
Chiapas, and thus earning his food and necessary means of 
subsistence." 
  Castellanos, a retired Army general, was accused of "having 
repressed, kidnapped, jailed, tortured, violated, and murdered 
members of Indian towns in Chiapas who were struggling legally 
and peacefully for their just rights. He was also accused of 
having dispossessed the Indians of their lands "in complicity 
with the federal government in office at the time" and of 
"having become one of the most powerful landowners in Chiapas 
State." 
  The commutation of his sentence and his pending release -- 
the communique is dated 20 January -- was presented as "a 
message to the Mexican people and the peoples and governments of 
the world." 
  In the city of San Cristobal de las Casas in Chiapas it was 
announced today that Castellanos may "appear" at any time during 
the course of this day in good physical condition.

  [Text] Mexico City, 25 Jan (AFP) -- The guerrillas of the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) "will not prevent the 
upcoming electoral process," Sub-Commander Marcos stated in a 
communique released Tuesday in Mexico. "We neither want nor can 
impose our ideas on Mexican civil society through the use of 
force, as does the current government when it imposes its 
programs on the country by force," he added. Presidential, 
legislative, and municipal elections are scheduled for 21 August. 
  In this pronouncement, Sub-Commander Marcos stated that 
"when 
a political and military force (such as the Mexican Federal 
Government) asks another political and military force (such as 
the EZLN) to hand over its weapons, that means in political and 
military terms that it is asking for an unconditional surrender. 
In exchange for unconditional surrender, the federal government 
is promising what it always does: an internal settling of 
accounts, a package of statements, promises, and more 
bureaucratic entities," he regretted. 
  The guerrilla leader added that the call to lay down their 
weapons "prompts the most suspicions. The historical lesson in 
Mexico and Latin America is that those who surrender their 
weapons trusting in the `pardon' of their pursuers winds up shot 
dead somewhere by the weapons of any death squad of any 
political or ruling faction." 
  In another communique, the EZLN command called on Mexicans 
"to rally" around "the cause of a national revolutionary 
movement where there is room for the broadest trends, the most 
varied thinking, and different forms of struggle, yet there is 
only one aspiration and goal: freedom, democracy, and justice." 
"The EZLN calls on Mexicans to take up this cause, not the EZLN 
cause, not the cause of an armed struggle, but the cause of what 
is the right of every thinking being, the reason of our nation 
and understanding of our people: freedom democracy, and 
justice," it added. 
  In its analysis of the current situation, the EZLN command 
attributes to civilian society more than to its own actions that 
the possibility of dialogue on the problems in Chiapas State has 
been achieved with the government. Military actions have not 
"been as decisive for this shift in the conflict as have been 
the different public demonstrations in the streets, the 
mountains, and the news media by the most varied organizations 
and honest and independent people who are part of what is called 
civilian Mexican society." 
  The guerrillas affirmed that the uprising was the only path 
"left to us," but admitted that "other modes of struggle exist 
and are of great value," adding that the steps of all who are 
marching with the truth must follow a single path: the one that 
leads to freedom, democracy, and justice."

<F P=106> [Speech by Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in </F>
Chiapas State on 25 January -- recorded] 
  [Text] Compatriots in Chiapas: I have been following events 
closely since the conflict in Chiapas began, and it has been the 
main concern of the president of the Republic. I have always 
tried to make decisions that would guarantee security for the 
population. With determination, I opened the path for a peaceful 
solution of the conflict. 
  The Mexican Army's role prevented the conflict from 
extending 
to other parts of Chiapas State. The Army fulfilled its 
constitutional duty with loyalty and will continue protecting 
the towns. 
  Today's main task is to seek peace by every means. You have 
witnessed all the efforts made to attain peace and the results 
obtained so far. Recent developments call for serious meditation 
from all of us to change old procedures and methods that did not 
work. 
  I have come to Chiapas to offer my steadfast support to the 
state in promoting peace, development, and justice. The most 
important factor will be a change in state relations. Projects 
and assistance will be defined by the municipalities, social 
organizations, and the state's congress, with political guidance 
from Governor Lopez Moreno. Your plans and most urgent projects 
will be supported by federal government institutions. Along with 
meeting your most urgent needs, we will redouble efforts to find 
in-depth solutions for the state's problems. 
  Our most urgent task is to work together toward 
reconciliation. We know that when there are major differences, 
this is not easy, and therefore, we must try again and again. 
The task we have ahead of us is everyone's responsibility and 
everyone must share it, including government employees, from the 
most simple service to the highest responsibility. It is also a 
task for the people of Chiapas and all of the communities. All 
of us, with the people of Chiapas united for security, justice, 
peace, and democracy, will have to establish better relations 
with Indian communities by modifying priorities and accepting 
their decisions. The task we have ahead will not be easy. In 
facing divisions and rancor, humanitarian feelings and new 
actions of justice must prevail. 
  To each family in Chiapas, I want to express my concern and 
also my sadness over the recent incidents. At the same time, I 
assure you we have been and will always be attentive to your 
needs. We will do whatever we can to guarantee your safety and 
promote justice, which are the bases for the tranquillity of 
every family and community. 
  Here we are. I have just held another meeting with the 
social 
organizations. We will continue to center our efforts on 
consolidating peace, justice, and promoting a better climate of 
coexistence in Chiapas. Together, united, I am sure we can make 
it. Thank you very much.

  [Text] Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and 
reconciliation in Chiapas, this afternoon sent a communique to 
the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN]. Camacho Solis' 
latest communique was sent in response to the communiques 
released 25 January by the EZLN's Indigenous Revolutionary 
Committee -- communiques in which Commander Marcos demanded that 
the government clearly state the degree to which it recognizes 
the EZLN. Commander Marcos made the demand in an effort to 
assess the value of any guarantees he might receive from the 
government during the dialogue process. 
  In his communique, Camacho Solis says a proposal that will 
be 
released on Thursday will formalize the terms for an honest, 
serious, and responsible meeting. Camacho Solis says the 
groundwork is being laid for a cease-fire, and he assured the 
EZLN that the government is giving humanitarian assistance to 
the communities that require food and health care. Finally, he 
said the communities, society, political parties, and 
institutions are all working to find more respectful ways of 
achieving the pacification demanded in Chiapas by way of a 
national commitment toward democracy, justice, and freedom.

  [Text] Mexico City, 25 Jan (EFE) -- Former Nicaraguan 
President Daniel Ortega today denied any links between the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) and guerrillas in 
Central America. 
  However, he added, it would not be surprising to find Latin 
Americans among the Zapatists, "because Latin America has always 
been present in the region's revolutionary movements, although 
violence is something that cannot be imported." 
  Ortega, who made a brief stopover in Mexico on his way to 
Cuba, said the armed conflict in Chiapas is a warning that 
proves the neoliberal policies imposed by the United States on 
Latin America are a social failure. 
  Ortega, who will attend a Cuban solidarity meeting on the 
Caribbean island, said the rebellion in southeastern Mexico 
should not only shake up the conscience of the Mexican people, 
but of the entire region. 
  "Until misery and social injustice disappear, violent 
movements will continue in Latin America," he added. Ortega 
also said the insurrection is a warning to goverments, which 
"should not rest on their laurels," believing that the fall of 
socialism in Eastern Europe means we are now living in "the 
kingdom of capitalism." 
  Governments "should realize that misery and unemployment are 
there, before their eyes, and that as long as there is misery 
and unemployment, there will be uprisings and social violence," 
he stressed.

<F P=106> [Telephone report by Jose Eduardo Campos from San Cristobal </F>
de las Casas, Chiapas State, from the "24 Hours" newscast -- 
live] 
  [Text] The Chiapas State Congress has approved the amnesty 
bill proposed by Governor Javier Lopez. The state amnesty law 
includes only common crimes punished by the Chiapas State Penal 
Code and committed strictly in connection with the violence that 
has occurred starting on 1 January. 
  The amnesty law is made up of seven articles, the first of 
which states that amnesty will be decreed in favor of all 
persons against whom penal actions have been taken or may be 
taken in Chiapas civilian courts for crimes perpetrated in 
connection with the events that occurred in several Chiapas 
State municipalities starting on 1 January. The implementation 
of these provisions will be handled by a special commission to 
be appointed by the Chiapas governor. 
  The second article states that individuals will benefit from 
the amnesty law provided that they turn in their weapons and 
hostages. 
  The third article deals with the suspension of all penal 
actions and sanctions decreed for crimes described in the law. 
  The fourth article involves the cancellation of arrest 
warrants that have already been issued, thus releasing people 
already sent to trial or sentenced to prison. 
  Article five states that the recently approved amnesty law 
will only be effective when the commission appointed by the 
governor issues a cease-fire declaration. The amnesty law 
cannot be implemented if the commission does not announce a 
cease-fire. 
  The sixth article states that persons who opt for the 
amnesty 
law cannot be arrested for previously committed crimes from now 
on. 
  The seventh and last article of this amnesty law states that 
the benefits will also apply to minors. 
  There is a provisional article in the amnesty law which 
specifically states that the law will become effective tomorrow 
when it is published by the official newspaper in Chiapas.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Mexican economic developments monitored through 25 
January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item. 
  Mexican Petroleum, Pemex, reported on 18 January that the 
United States purchased 66 percent of the Mexican petroleum 
exports for 1993, Spain got 14.9 percent, and Japan 6 percent. 
Pemex reported a slight decline in petroleum prices last 
December both on the American continent and in Europe. Company 
sources concluded that the annual daily average of petroleum 
exports for 1993 totaled 1,337,400 barrels. (Paris AFP in 
Spanish 0035 GMT 19 Jan 94) 
  During the present administration, the Mexican Stock Market 
has become the ninth largest in the world. The National 
Securities Commission explained that the Mexican Stock Market 
grew by 705 percent in 1993 with respect to 1988. The 
Commission added that the capitalization value of the stock 
market in 1993 totaled 624 billion new pesos. Regarding the 
flow of foreign investments in the stock market, they totaled 
over $10 billion last year. So far the Mexican Stock Market has 
accumulated $23.5 billion in foreign investments. (Mexico City 
Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 19 Jan 94) 
  The secretary of communications and transportation on 18 
January presented the balance of an intense work plan for 1994. 
He reported the communication and transportation modernization 
program for 1994. The official said consolidated spending for 
this sector will total 50 billion new pesos, of which 34 billion 
will be supplied by private businesses. The government 
earmarked approximately 16 billion new pesos for the 
communications and transportation sector. The official concluded 
2,476 km of highways will be built in 1994, adding that public 
investment in national railroads will total 1 billion new pesos, 
while private investments will equal 200 million new pesos. 
(Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 19 Jan 
94) 
  The Mexican Government has received a $300-million loan from 
the Inter-American Development Bank, IDB, for 
scientific-technological areas and the development of the 
tourism infrastructure. Finance Secretary Pedro Aspe Armella 
and the IDB vice president signed the loan document at the 
Finance Secretariat offices. Of the $300 million, $230 million 
is destined for the scientific and technological area to finance 
projects. The remaining $70 million will be earmarked for the 
Tourism Fund to promote Mexico's participation in the world 
tourism market. (Mexico City XEW Television in Spanish 0430 GMT 
20 Jan 94) 
  The Secretariat of Communication and Transportation has 
authorized the participation of foreign companies in the fax and 
electronic mail services market. In a bulletin issued on 19 
January, the Secretariat said this provision went into effect in 
January to promote the development of telecommunication service 
infrastructure in Mexico. This measure, however, does not 
include the service of videotext and telepac, which will open to 
the international market in 1995. (Paris AFP in Spanish 0005 GMT 
21 Jan 94) 
  Banco de Comercio Exterior has issued $1 billion worth of 
bonds at a 10-year term. The bonds were successfully sold in 
European, Asian, and U.S. markets. The institution said that 
given world competition to attract capital, the global bonds 
[bonos globales] represent a new alternative for attracting 
foreign capital. Bank sources said the resources obtained from 
the issue of bonds will be earmarked for investment projects 
connected to exports. (Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca 
Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 24 Jan 94) 
  Inflation rose by 0.4 during the first 15 days of January. 
It should be pointed out that for the same period in 1993 
inflation totaled 0.8 percent, namely twice as much as this 
year. According to the Bank of Mexico, the products and 
services whose prices rose in the first days of January were 
rent, domestic gas, fruits and vegetables, urban transportation, 
and soft drinks. During the first 15 days of January, the 
Consumer Price Index of the basic market basket rose by 0.7 
percent with regard to the previous 15 days. (Mexico City Canal

  [Text] Brasilia, 24 Jan (EFE) -- The Cuban Embassy in 
Brazil has categorically denied that President Fidel Castro 
officially invited his fired former colleague, Fernando Collor 
de Melo, who travelled with his wife Rosane over the weekend to 
vacation on the island. 
  Cuban Ambassador Jorge Alberto Bolanos assured Foreign 
Minister Celso Amorim that the alleged invitation does not 
exist, to the extent that the Collors will not be lodged in any 
of the official or special guest houses that the government owns 
on the island. 
  A source close to Collor has admitted in a round about way 
that an adviser of the former president was the origin of the 
rumors. The former president will also visit France, but he will 
not be given any exceptional honor. 
  The rumor that Collor was going to be treated as a chief of 
state in Cuba caused a lot of concern in Havana, so much so that 
the consul in Sao Paulo, Rafael Hidalgo, was asked to visit the 
leaders of the Workers Party (PT, leftist) to express an 
energetic denial. 
  The visit took place while a letter was on its way to Fidel 
Castro from Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, the PT's leader and 
presidential candidate, in which he expresses surprise and 
regret over any special reception for the former president, 
although he also admitted the possibility that the rumor 
originated within Collor's advisers, who are very active in 
their campaign to reinstate him.

<F P=106> [Article by Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho, </F>
Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, PMDB] 
  [Text] The way the CPI [Congressional Investigating 
Committee] unfolded is the most conclusive proof of a change in 
Brazilian political practice. In former times, the CPI would 
not have even been instituted or, had it been instituted it 
would have come to nothing. Had it not fizzled out, it would 
have been suspended or killed on this and that pretext. In the 
end, it would have fallen into oblivion before the culprits were 
identified, much less punished. 
  Let us now compare this gloomy scenario with the reality of 
openness, clarity, correction, and balance that has 
characterized the work of the CPI. Which leads us to just one 
conclusion: The CPI is not the cause, but rather the consequence 
of the change in Brazilian political habits. 
  Moreover, this case is not the only one. The CPI on [Former 
President Fernando] Collor's government served as precedent for 
the Budget CPI. Optimists were then outnumbered by skeptics 
but, in the end, the reverberations of the outcome surprised 
everybody. It goes without saying that such a deep change 
entails a fair dose of suffering. The reports on the CPI 
contained attempts to explain -- which convinced no one -- 
examples of powerful men being publicly humiliated, and details 
of voters' disappointment. Some even considered the CPI a 
threat to politicians. It was argued that a tidal wave of 
charges could prompt an over-generalization, branding all 
politicians -- guilty and innocent -- alike. 
  If such a risk existed, it was averted. The CPI exalted 
Brazilian politicians. A few were exposed, but many grew in 
stature, beginning with CPI chairman Senator Jarbas Passarinho 
and CPI rapporteur Deputy Roberto Magalhaes. The most 
praiseworthy achievement of these outstanding Brazilians was 
their presence of mind and balance. They ensured that everybody 
had the right to a defense. They never allowed the CPI to 
become a witch hunt. If there were injustices, they arose from 
the natural imperfection of human judgment. 
  Political parties also stood to gain from the CPI, starting 
with the PMDB. From the very beginning, its representatives in 
the Chamber of Deputies staked their good reputation, and the 
invariably decisive number of their votes, on the CPI. An 
example, among many, of impeccable behavior was that of Roberto 
Rollemberg, chairman of the PMDB in Sao Paulo. If a negligible 
minority of congressmen have been found guilty in the final CPI 
report, the only line to take is to accept the verdict and expel 
them from the party. There is no alternative. There has been a 
shift in political habits in Brazil. As a final lesson, the CPI 
showed us that the most vulnerable points of Brazilian 
legislation must be urgently corrected. 
  Now is the time to do so. The constitutional reform enables 
us to implement mechanisms that will prevent (or at least make 
more difficult) a repetition of such events. Changing the rules 
that govern parliamentary immunity, raising bank confidentiality 
for all those who hold an elective post, implementing a new 
strategy for drafting the budget, incorporating the mixed 
district system [changing the election system to base 
representation on units of local government, i.e. counties], and 
creating a vote system to enable the dismissal from office, 
among other measures, will enhance the management of public 
money. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. May 
corruption be forever banished from the national budget.

  [Text] According to a poll made by Datafolha on 19 and 20 
January, most people in the electoral strongholds of four of the 
18 lawmakers on the black list of the budget CPI [Congressional 
Investigating Committee] agree with their dismissal. The poll 
requested opinions on PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] 
deputy for Sao Paulo Manoel Moreira, independent deputy for 
Bahia Joao Alves, PFL [Liberal Front Party] deputy for 
Pernambuco Ricardo Fiuza, and PMDB deputy for Maranhao Cid 
Carvalho. 
  Manoel Moreira obtained the highest number of opinions in 
favor of his dismissal (78 percent). He is known to 92 percent 
of Campinas (Sao Paulo) voters, which is his main electoral 
stronghold. Among those polled, 58 percent believed they were 
well informed on his involvement in the charges of budget 
corruption, while 55 percent said his work in Congress had 
brought no benefit to the city. 
  Deputy Joao Alves, against whom the main charges of 
involvement in the scandal have been pressed, obtained 68 
percent of opinions in favor of his dismissal. The poll was 
made in Itarantim (Bahia), one of the various cities in which he 
obtained a significant number of votes in the last elections. 
  Also in the case of Alves, the majority of those polled (35 
percent) believe that his work as lawmaker has not produced any 
benefits for the city, where 99 percent of those polled know 
him. However, he obtained the highest percentage of opinions 
that his work produced much benefit to the city (26 percent). 
None of the others surpassed the 10 percent mark. 
  In Recife, 74 percent of voters believe that former minister 
Ricardo Fiuza must be dismissed. Among those polled, 49 percent 
said that his work had not produced any benefit for the city, 
where he is known by 81 percent of the people polled. 
  Voters were more benevolent with Cid Carvalho, whose resume 
registers a dismissal under the terms of the AI-5 [Institutional 
Act No. 5]. He obtained the lowest number of opinions in favor 
of his dismissal. 
  The poll was made in Imperatriz (Maranhao), where he was 
known by 93 percent of those polled. The majority (54 percent) 
have learned about the charges against him, but only 17 percent 
consider themselves well informed.

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Helena Tachinardi] </F>
  [Text] The government is waiting for Congress to approve a 
bill to establish controls on the export and import of 
dual-purpose military goods (for civilian and military purposes 
and directly linked services) prior to negotiating our entry 
into the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), an 
organization created by a group of countries in 1987 to control 
the export of technologies and systems that can contribute to 
the proliferation of missiles capable of carrying nuclear 
warheads. 
  Draft bill 2530/92, which is included in the executive 
branch 
message 36/92, has already been approved by the Chamber of 
Deputies Economy Committee and has a preliminary favorable 
opinion of coordinator Fabio Feldmann, of the Consumer Defense, 
Environment, and Minorities Committee. His advisers state that 
the report will be finished by the end of the month and will be 
included the amendments proposed by the Navy Ministry last week. 
The draft was also sent to the National Defense, Science and 
Technology, and Constitution and Justice Committees. 
  Having been approved by two committees -- because the 
Foreign 
Ministry already has the approval of the Environment Committee 
-- the government will now ask for very urgent discussion of the 
bill using a procedure that sends the bill directly to the 
plenum without passing through other committees. 
  Diplomatic sources have stated that the government wants to 
increase Brazilian credibility before the international 
community. To become a member of the MTCR, Congress must first 
approve the bill controlling the export of dual-purpose 
materiel. Congress must also ratify the quadripartite nuclear 
safeguards agreement among Brazil, Argentina, the 
Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control (ABACC), 
and the amendments to the Tlatelolco Treaty that ban nuclear 
weapons in Latin America. The Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee postponed voting on both items last week. 
  A diplomatic source commented: "Brazil's participation in 
the 
MTCR comes under the nonproliferation policy." By approving the 
bill, Brazil will be prohibited from passing technologies 
received from industrialized countries to countries considered 
untrustworthy, such as Iraq, North Korea, and Libya. 
  The bill sent to the Chamber of Deputies in August 1992 
provides for the creation of an international importation 
certificate by which importers commit themselves to refrain from 
exporting certain goods without previous authorization of the 
appropriate Brazilian authorities. The bill also creates a 
delivery verification certificate to confirm the entry of the 
product into the importing country. The bill anticipates -- 
under the jurisdiction of the president of the Republic -- the 
creation of a permanent interministerial commission comprising 
representatives of various ministries. 
  The position of executive secretary will be filled by the 
Strategic Affairs Secretariat (SAE). 
  In his preliminary report, Fabio Feldmann (PSDB-SP) 
[Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Sao Paulo] says: "Military 
materiels, such as ammunition and explosives in any of their 
diverse forms, require strict controls on their handling, 
transport, and storage. [no closing quotation marks as published]

<F P=106> [Article by Carlos MacArthur: "DPF Beats Records in Drug </F>
Seizures"] 
  [Text] For the Federal Police Department [DPF], 1993 was 
the year of drugs. The volume of drugs seized between January 
and November was three times higher than in all of 1992. And the 
big champion was cocaine at 8,000 kg. The biggest cocaine 
seizure occurred in Rio Grande do Sul when a single operation by 
the Drug Enforcement Division (DRE) took two metric tons of the 
drug out of circulation. 
  According to the DRE's director, Sergio Sakon, the increase 
in drug seizures results from the fact that Brazil has become 
the main exit route for cocaine produced by the Colombian and 
Bolivian cartels. Sakon points out that Brazil has a very wide 
range of ports through which 95 percent of Brazil's exports 
pass. The traffickers take advantage of that to conceal the drug 
in logs and even in electrical transformers. Moreover, many 
ships wait outside Brazil's territorial waters for small boats 
or helicopters to bring them the merchandise, which will then be 
sold on the U.S. or European market. 
  Brazil's neighbors in South America are Peru, the largest 
producer of coca base; Colombia, the biggest refiner; and 
Bolivia, a big producer. All of them take advantage of the lack 
of surveillance and of border posts, especially in the Amazon 
Region, to transport the coca base. 
  In 1993, the DRE intensified its cooperation with 
international organizations and foreign governments for the 
purpose of controlling drugs. Thanks to exchanges with Germany, 
Great Britain, and the United States, Federal Police agents have 
been attending advanced training courses abroad, and foreign 
experts have visited our country. In Sergio Sakon's opinion, the 
results are visible in the considerable number of 
"mules"--independent couriers--arrested in 1993 before they 
boarded aircraft at the international airports in Rio de Janeiro 
and Sao Paulo. 
<H5>  Operations Cover Entire Country </H5>
  Inroads into gangs of drug traffickers in 1993 were not 
restricted to just one region. The various operations resulted 
in the seizure of coca base and cocaine from north to south: two 
metric tons in Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul), 90 kg in Mato 
Grosso, 1,100 kg in Belem (Para), 220 kg in Fortaleza, 550 in 
Manaus, and 200 kg in the Mato Grosso town of Nova Olimpia. 
  And in Amazonas, Federal Police destroyed 80,000 epadu 
(Brazilian coca) plants growing on four plantations. The choice 
of Amazonas for planting Brazilian coca is explained by the 
region's climatic conditions and the area's large expanse, which 
makes access and policing difficult. 
  The various operations taking place in 1993 included the 
destruction of 2,139,000 marijuana plants in the Sao Francisco 
Valley and the Pernambuco back country--the equivalent of a 
little over two metric tons of the drug. Those operations, known 
as "Monte Santo," "Ouricuri," and "Independence," took place 
with the cooperation of the Army, whose troops helped eradicate 
the plantings discovered in the Northeast Region. 
<H5>  Amphetamines Gaining Ground </H5>
  A growing concern among authorities in 1993 was the 
appearance of large amounts of amphetamines in the drug market. 
Although centers of use were detected in most regions of the 
country, the southern states seem to have the largest number of 
laboratories. Following an exhaustive investigation lasting more 
than three months, the Federal Police succeeded in closing two 
illegal laboratories, one in Campinas in Sao Paulo State and the 
other in Florianopolis. 
  The largest seizure of amphetamines involved 300 kg of MDA, 
whose effects are not well known but which can be manufactured 
on a large scale at a reasonably low cost. Closing down the 
laboratory in the capital of Santa Catarina put an end to a gang 
with branches in the states of Mato Grosso, Para, and Rio Grande 
do Sul and left hanging the suspicion that there has been a new 
escalation of drugs in our country. 
<H5>  Battle Against Illegal Prospecting </H5>
  The Operations Department of the Federal Police took action 
in the Amazon Region in 1993 to combat more than the drug 
traffic. At the very start of the year, Operation "Catrimani" 
arrived in the Ianomami area to evict prospectors and conduct a 
survey for the purpose of beginning Operation "Free Forest," 
which removed more than 4,000 prospectors from the reservations 
beginning in February. The result was the seizure of three 
aircraft and a large quantity of fuel. 
  The work continued when the Mato Grosso superintendency 
stepped in to evict lumbermen and prospectors from Nambiquara 
Indian reservations. The greatest destruction there was in the 
protected areas of valuable timber species such as mahogany and 
cherry wood. Many weapons and large amounts of ammunition were 
seized. 
  In southern Para, two operations took up a good part of the 
year as agents looked for clandestine radio stations used in the 
drug traffic and investigated slavery, chiefly involving 
underage girls forced into prostitution.

<F P=106> ["Summary" of interview with Uruguayan Vice President </F>
Gonzalo Aguirre; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [BUSQUEDA] How would you evaluate the National 
Party's situation 10 months before the elections? 
  [Aguirre] I see it as being unconcerned with its future. 
There is currently a struggle going on for the prevalence of 
each sector's interests within the party itself. There are many 
leaders who are worried over their personal situation and their 
political survival, waiting to see which faction leader can give 
them relative security or an election guarantee. The 
Herreraist, Lacalle's, faction is worried about its candidate 
and the need to constitute a majority within the party. The 
National Rocha Movement (MNR) is concerned with the same thing. 
Many leaders from the now dissolved movement For The Fatherland 
seem to be concerned with finding a place that will guarantee 
them a political future after 1995. I do not observe a general 
concern, as it should be, for the electoral triumph of the 
National Party. 
  [BUSQUEDA] There are at least six sectors led by important 
National Party members (Lacalle, Pereyra, Aguirre, Zumaran, 
Abreu, Ramos) but it is not known how they will vote. Isn't the 
National Party's supply of candidates too confusing? 
  [Aguirre] The party has three movements represented at a 
national level: the Herreraist faction, the MNR, and the Renewal 
and Victory Movement [MRV]. There are other new groups formed 
around some leaders who still do not have a national presence. 
Their intention is form alliances or reach agreements with the 
existing organized factions. Last 14 December at the Cambadu 
[Association of Uruguayan Retail Merchants, Bar Owners, and 
Related Businessman], before 3,000 party members, I said that 
there are many party members who do not belong to the MNR or to 
Lacalle's faction, and who would be attracted by a force 
grouping together those with a common party origin and with a 
similar vision about the future of the country. I am willing to 
lead this group. I will not act as a spare tire for anyone, and 
I am not willing to place everything that I built up from 
scratch, with a lot of effort between 1987 and 1989, at the 
service of others. 
  [BUSQUEDA] Then will you be a presidential candidate? 
  [Aguirre] I am willing to be a candidate if my political 
friends so desire. 
  [BUSQUEDA] With how many candidates will the National Party 
run? 
  [Aguirre] At least three. Some citizens will never vote for 
Carlos Julio Pereyra or for Lacalle's candidate. To force them 
to vote for one of them would be a bad electoral strategy for 
the National Party. 
  [BUSQUEDA] The Herreraist faction estimates that the best 
electoral advantage for the National Party will be the results 
of the economic policy. Do you agree with this? 
  [Aguirre] The best proposal will be that which adopts the 
wisest approach to the national problems. Candidates must speak 
not of what has happened, but of what is to come. It is true 
that the good results from the economic policy will be important 
for the success of the party. But this success will not come 
about just because the president or the economy minister keep 
telling the people that the economic situation is very good. If 
the people feel that the situation is good, they will recognize 
this without needing anyone to tell them so, and they will vote 
accordingly. I nonetheless think that the people, unfairly, 
continue to perceive the economic situation as bad, even though 
the great majority of the people are better off at present. 
  [BUSQUEDA] Why do you think this is so? 
  [Aguirre] There is a problem with the government spokesmen. 
They tend not to announce the good news and to stress the 
unpopular measures. For example, instead of telling the retired 
workers how good it is that they are better off now than in the 
past, they are told that they constitute a serious problem for 
the country. People get mad when they are blamed by their 
governors of something for which they are not responsible. 
  [BUSQUEDA] What do you think of President Lacalle's active 
participation in public acts during an election year? 
  [Aguirre] The president of the Republic is making an 
enormous 
effort, carrying out very intense activity, according to his 
personality, and perhaps this will help improve the government's 
image and the party's possibilities. However, in the final 
stages of the campaign, in the last three or four months, this 
will not either help or hinder us. The protagonist cannot be 
someone who cannot be a candidate according to the Constitution. 
The protagonists must be the candidates. Those who will 
compete in the race will be those who sign up to run, and 
Lacalle is prohibited from signing up to run for this race. 
  [BUSQUEDA] What is the situation of the MRV after former 
Ministers Ramos and Abreu, and some deputies and other leaders, 
left the faction? 
  [Aguirre] From the electoral point of view their 
estrangement 
was not important. They brought prestige to the MRV when they 
held public posts, but they are not backed by any national 
political current. If not, they should demonstrate it in the 
elections. In 1989 the people voted for Gonzalo Aguirre. 
Besides, even though those citizens left, others are coming in. 
During the rally at Cambadu I had the honor of having Professor 
Juan Pivel Devoto sitting by my side, as well as Paysandu Mayor 
Jorge Larranaga, Carlos Rodriguez Labruna [former education 
under secretary], former Deputy Elias Porras Larralde, and Jose 
Radiccioni.

  [Text] The Air Force invested 3 million soles in 1993 to 
control the 17 airstrips and airports in Upper Huallaga, and in 
infrastructure and equipment for the various groups deployed in 
the area. 
  This figure does not include the allocations for flight 
hours 
and fuel used by the Air Force for interdiction operations. 
  Among the Upper Huallaga airports that the Air Force began 
to 
control in July 1992 are those in Santa Lucia, Tocache, Uchiza, 
Saposoa, Bellavista, Juanjui, Tarapoto, Yurimaguas, Sion, 
Palmapampa (Ayacucho), Izcosazin, and Caballococha (Amazonian 
Trapeze), Puerto Bermudez, and Pucallpa. 
  Concerning the Palmapampa airport, which is located in La 
Mar 
Province (Ayacucho), the Air Force has controlled it since 1 
November 1993. 
  This airport was very important for drug trafficking in the 
area, because that area had become a drug trafficking storage 
center. 
  The drugs were taken from Upper Huallaga to this area, to be 
loaded in small Colombian planes that took off in Colombia, 
crossed Brazilian airspace (Cruzeirodo Brasil zone), and arrived 
in Palmapampa.

  [Text] The Shining Path does not intend to seek 
reconciliation in the country, has disarmed itself neither 
militarily nor ideologically, and is instead trying to become a 
semi-legal party operating as a shock force against the 
opposition, subversion specialist Carlos Tapia has said. 
  Tapia emphasized that the Shining Path faction led by 
Abimael 
Guzman Reinoso enjoys government favor, and among other things 
has been given assistance in organizing a second party congress. 
  He said that imprisoned Shining Path members of the 
Guzman-led faction, such as Edmundo Cox Beuzeville, have been 
allowed to tour several prisons and to promote debates to 
support the proposal of so-called President Gonzalo. 
  Tapia said: "The Shining Path was defeated, but it seems 
that after the beginning of negotiations, Abimael Guzman's 
leadership has been consolidated, tied to the commitment to 
organize a second party congress." 
  "The documents of this second congress are being prepared to 
make the Shining Path stop engaging in armed actions. It is 
true that armed actions will end, but no one knows when. A new, 
stronger Shining Path could reemerge later for a second 
beginning, and as a weapon for fighting popular movements...," 
Tapia said. 
  He added that peace negotiations between the Shining Path 
and 
the government are being held behind the country's back. 
  Tapia believes the government is seeking to strengthen 
Abimael Guzman's leadership within Shining Path, countering the 
hardline faction led by Alberto Ramirez Durand, aka "Feliciano." 
  Guzman's faction, Tapia said, represents the imprisoned 
Shining Path, while the one led by "Feliciano" is made up of the 
terrorists who are still free. "They are the ones who plant the 
bombs," he said. For his part, ex-leftist Senator Enrique 
Bernales has said that the Guzman group is trying to sell itself 
in order to eventually gain its freedom and later regroup. 
  Tapia and Bernales made these statements during an interview 
on the "En Directo" program hosted by Alfredo Barnechea on 
Channel 9. 
  The statements were made in the wake of a letter that 
Shining 
Path member Edmundo Cox addressed to Colonel Gabino Cajahuanca, 
the director of the Miguel Castro Castro prison, asking him for 
an audience "to inform you about what we have done." 
  Cox was referring to the meetings he held with imprisoned 
Shining Path members in other prisons of the country to support 
the peace proposal by Guzman Reinoso, against the faction led by 
"Feliciano." 
  Carlos Tapia, who is a careful observer of the subversion 
phenomenon, believes that the Shining Path does not seek 
national reconciliation, and that it maintains its ideological 
positions, such as "hatred of classes" and its stand against the 
"legal leftist sector, human rights organizations, popular 
unions, and nongovernmental organizations."
