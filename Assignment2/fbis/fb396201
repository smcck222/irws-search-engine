<F P=106> [Article by Alberto Adrianzen M.: "Trapped With No Way </F>
Out?"] 
  [Text] This Christmas may not be President Fujimori's best 
one. The engineer's presents--and oh, what Christmas 
presents!--will be the task of solving several problems that he 
surely never thought would come up. 
  First of all, the results of the 31 October referendum, 
which 
were a real surprise. The government was expecting a result of 
more than 65 percent, which would enable it to guarantee the 
future reelection of President Fujimori and finish out the cycle 
begun on 5 April. In other words, to legitimize and legalize the 
Fujimori regime itself in a single act. That has not been 
possible. The new constitution is practically stillborn. In this 
context, the weakness of the new constitution as a legal basis 
for Fujimorism is a fact of life. 
  Secondly, what was going to be the political basis of 
Fujimorism, an indisputable electoral-legal majority, is also in 
doubt. The near stalemate and the triumph of the "no" vote in 
more than a dozen departments have shattered the dream of an 
overwhelming, undeniable political majority that would be loyal 
to the president personally. Moreover, there is the uncertainty 
of foreign and national investors in the face of the election 
results and the political scandals that will certainly come to 
light in connection with the handling of the debt papers. 
  These developments have a variety of consequences. The most 
important one is the beginning of the presidential campaign for 
1995, which shows how fragile President Fujimori's future 
prospects are. Some sectors are already seeking to build a 
Fujimorism without Fujimori. Meanwhile, others (such as Daniel 
Estrada, Ricardo Belmont, and Luis Caceres) are practically in 
full swing in their presidential campaigns. 
  The other major consequence is that the opposition and other 
social sectors have managed to open up new opportunities and 
place themselves in an expectant situation. This fact is so 
obvious that even the extraparliamentary opposition, sidelined 
until very recently, has managed to raise its head, as evidenced 
by Belaunde's presence at a rally held not too long ago in the 
city of Iquitos. 
  Evidently, President Fujimori's legitimacy and the legality 
of the political regime inaugurated on 5 April are now being 
called into question. One indication of this weakness, for 
example, is the way the La Cantuta case has been unfolding. 
  Another manifestation is the president's appeal for a 
national accord. It shows a desire to bring order to a political 
situation that got out of the government's control on 31 
October. The goal is to shift the government's political 
position with respect to public opinion, which wants consensus 
and is sick of confrontations,[.sup]1[/] and at the same time 
to head off the avalanche of constitutional amendments that the 
opposition and other social sectors are proposing. 
<H5>  La Cantuta: A Political Test </H5>
  The people who committed the atrocity of La Cantuta 
certainly 
never imagined that their actions would unleash a political 
scandal or give rise to an investigation, much less that the 
incident would become one of the most disturbing developments 
for this government. The same group had probably been involved 
in other actions that were never investigated. One of them, in 
fact, the disappearance of almost an entire family in Huacho, is 
quite similar to the La Cantuta case. 
  Nevertheless, the La Cantuta affair, bravely revealed by the 
magazine SI, has placed the government on the horns of a 
dilemma: Either it knuckles under to pressure from the military 
not to allow a serious investigation of this atrocity, punishing 
only those who directly participated in the operation, or it 
decides to face the issue head-on, jeopardizing the so-called 
military hierarchy and the Armed Forces' perception of Fujimori 
as their leader. 
  It should be noted that after the accusations made by 
Congressman Henry Pease in April of last year, the military, 
without even consulting the president, decided to take the tanks 
out into the streets. 
  Furthermore, the problem of La Cantuta has ceased to be 
simply a matter of human rights violations; it has also become a 
kind of political test that will measure institutional and group 
responses and relationships that are important to this 
government. 
  Several institutions are involved in La Cantuta. The first 
one is the Democratic Constituent Congress (CCD) itself, which, 
having changed its earlier position in view of the overwhelming 
evidence, has now demanded that the matter be handled by 
civilian courts rather than military ones. 
  Another institution involved is the judiciary, which will 
have to determine soon, when the prosecutor decides to file 
charges, whether the La Cantuta affair is a matter of common or 
military jurisdiction. The military courts' objections to 
prosecutors' questioning the military personnel allegedly 
involved in this multiple crime, and their refusal to turn over 
information to the CCD on the grounds that the matter is outside 
its jurisdiction, show just how far the stonewallers can go. 
  The Armed Forces themselves are involved as an institution, 
and to be perfectly honest, the political survival of the Army's 
top echelon is at stake, in view of the accusations by General 
Robles from his asylum in Argentina that they were accomplices 
in this criminal incident. 
  There is something more, as well. The solution to the La 
Cantuta case will also serve to assess the relationship between 
President Fujimori's government and that of the United States. 
It is well known that the Clinton administration, ambiguities 
aside, is anxious for this case to be resolved on the best 
possible terms as a first step toward changing the command 
structure of the Armed Forces. 
  And finally, the relationship between President Fujimori and 
the military hierarchy, one of the pillars of the regime 
inaugurated on 5 April, is at stake. President Fujimori's recent 
confirmation of the commanders-in-chief of the various branches 
of the military, including the police, and the scandalous 
exclusion of Parliament from the process of promoting the 
highest-ranking officers[.sup]2[/] show not only that he has 
already made one decision--to protect the senior military 
commanders--but also that there is some instability in the 
relationship between the military leadership and the president 
that could result in a coup d'etat or in a change of personnel 
in that leadership. 
  For this reason, as we have stated, the La Cantuta case is a 
true political test. At risk is the autonomy of the 
aforementioned institutions, as well as the ability of the key 
players to exert pressure. There is, then, a direct relationship 
between the institutions' independence and the political power 
they theoretically wield. The latter is important, given that 
one of the variables for measuring the authoritarianism of a 
regime is precisely the degree of autonomy--and therefore 
power--exercised by these institutions. 
  If the judiciary decides to stay out of the La Cantuta case 
or to defer to the military courts, we can conclude, once again, 
that this institution is not autonomous and, therefore, that 
either it is a mere appendage of the government or it has no 
power. The same can be said of the CCD. 
  This would confirm the notion that the objectives of the 
self-coup of 5 April were not to reform the judiciary or the 
political system. Rather, these objectives can be found in the 
logic of the neoliberal economic model, the antisubversion 
strategy itself, and the role of the military, as shown in the 
documents published by the magazine OIGA.[.sup]3[/] 
  For this reason, the danger of this kind of political 
development, and of La Cantuta, is that they reveal the real 
intensions of power, and therefore, they always end up imposing 
a "zero sum" logic in which the gains of the victorious are 
based on the total losses of the defeated. 
  To put it another way, if the triumph of Fujimori and the 
military hierarchy in the La Cantuta affair is based on the 
unconditional defeat of the opposition and greater political 
control over the institutions of the regime, it entails greater 
involvement by the military in the government, since it is the 
military that has actually won the game. Consequently, now the 
groundwork has really been laid for a transition toward a 
civilian-military government that could, in the short term, as 
more incidents such as La Cantuta are revealed,[.sup]4[/] 
turn into a military government. 
  That is why, if the results of 31 October represent a severe 
blow to the future of President Fujimori and his government, La 
Cantuta reveals a president walking into a blind alley. Mr. 
Fujimori has ended up entangled in his own alliances. 
  The question is whether he is trapped for good, in which 
case 
he could become an irrelevancy, depending on how things unfold, 
or whether he will decide to put on a military uniform. The 
tragedy in all this is that it would not be the uniform of 
Francisco Bolognesi or Miguel Grau, but that of Martin Rivas or 
Nicolas de Bari Hermoza. This uniform could quickly take on a 
black hue. There is, however, another option: changing the 
military leadership. 
Footnotes 
  1. The surveys conducted by the agency IMASEN immediately 
after 31 October yielded the following results: About 80 percent 
thought the Constitution should be amended before being 
promulgated; 73 percent thought there should be a political 
accord between the government and the opposition. It should be 
mentioned that the IMASEN survey was conducted in Lima, one of 
the government's most important political bastions. 
  2. Actually, rather than assuage the Army's fears about La 
Cantuta, the promotions have caused greater consternation. For 
example, as some news media, including the magazine SI, have 
pointed out, no one from the artillery, to which Gen. Valdivia 
belongs, has been promoted to major general. 
  3. We are referring to the documents published by that 
magazine several months ago. According to the magazine, the 
documents, of military origin, mention a political plan to 
govern this country for at least 15 years, through either a 
civilian government or a military regime. 
  4. As we finished writing this article, Channel 9, ATV, 
reported the disappearance of nine people in Chimbote in May of 
last year. The operation followed a pattern quite similar to 
that of La Cantuta. There was an attack in the area, and a few 
days later nine people suspected of being Shining Path members 
disappeared. This time the accusations have focused on the Navy, 
so it is not just the Army that is involved in this kind of 
action, but another branch of the military as well.

<F P=106> [Report by Ibeth Vega G.] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, after the government alliance broke up, 
President Guillermo Endara proceeded to dismiss several Molirena 
[Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement] members from his 
government. He fired the San Miguelito mayor as well as the 
governors of Panama and Cocle. 
  Yesterday afternoon, Endara himself confirmed the 
appointment 
of John Hoger as San Miguelito mayor replacing Ruben Dario 
Campos. Daphne Guinard de Clement replaces Irlena Brown as 
Panama governor and Lindberg Ramos replaces Generoso Carles as 
Cocle governor. The former Cocle governor is nephew to Molirena 
presidential candidate Ruben Dario Carles. 
  The first changes in the Endara administration took place 
two 
days after the government alliance broke up as a result of not 
reaching an agreement aimed at forming a presidential slate 
during negotiations. 
  Endara stated the changes in his government are positive, 
but 
more than anything else, these changes are aimed at providing 
more benefits to the needy. 
  Yesterday afternoon, former Governor Irlina Brown was 
interviewed by LA PRENSA over the telephone and she indicated 
she had not yet received any calls notifying her of the 
presidencial decision. Brown added: "I think it is totally 
ridiculous that I found out from the media. I have been here all 
day and I have not received any direct or official notification 
yet." 
  According to Brown, party leaders have instructed Molirena 
members to remain in their positions until told to do otherwise; 
"however, it is unfortunate we are returning to former times, 
especially after we fought so hard." 
  On the other hand, Solidarity Party President Samuel Lewis 
Galindo sent Endara a letter yesterday calling on him to prevent 
the vacancies resulting from Molirena resignations from becoming 
political booty. "We urge you to appoint people to those 
positions who are not involved in politics or who will guarantee 
respect for the public employees' stability so the sad practice 
of distributing political quotas to satisfy the insatiable does 
not continue," the note added. 
  Meanwhile, Endara said he has been conducting consultations 
and thinking about possible cabinet changes. He added the 
government crisis resulting from the dismissal of Molirena 
members "will not weaken my government, although I will have to 
make some adjustments because it will have internal 
repercussions. I am thinking about possible changes. They will 
be announced once I make a decision." 
  Endara deplored the break up of the government alliance, 
adding that Molirena's decision to break off the negotiations 
was "silly."

<F P=106> [From the "Telemetro Reports" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, Arnulfist Party [PA] 
presidential candidate, said that if Molirena [Nationalist 
Liberal Republican Movement] members wish to remain in the 
government, it will be up to Molirena leaders. De Gruber 
reiterated that an alliance with the friendly parties could not 
be made in response to personal interests. 
  [Begin recording] [De Gruber] On Sunday we nominated a 
presidential slate of three candidates. We said PA was a 
serious party and that the three candidates on the slate were to 
go to the campaign. In any case, convention delegates agreed to 
form alliances with other parties after 23 January, provided 
that those parties wished to join the alliance. They left that 
possibility open. 
  [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] with Molirena, 
then? 
  [De Gruber] Yes. 
  [Reporter] Do you wish to meet with Professor Carles? 
  [De Gruber] If he wants to meet with me, I would be pleased 
to meet with him. 
  [Reporter] Will the PA presidential ticket change? 
  [De Gruber] No. 
  [Reporter] Are you aware of the fact that this division is 
making it possible for the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] 
to win? 
  [De Gruber] Listen, we -- and I personally -- did all we 
could to form an alliance. I said this a month ago in David. 
We believe there must be an alliance of all parties. However, 
here the interests of some prevailed over those of the country. 
  [Reporter] Some people have said that the president has 
talked too much about politics and may be violating some 
electoral provisions. Do you agree? 
  [De Gruber] The president said at all times that there will 
be free, clean, and democratic elections in this country. No 
matter who wins, the president will surrender the Presidency to 
that person. Nobody can prevent him from making any statements 
he may have made as a member of his party after working hours. 
  [Reporter] Do you fear a possible trial of the president? 
[Legislative Assembly President] Arturo Vallarino said it was 
possible. 
  [De Gruber] Listen, I understand Arturo Vallarino said that 
if the Molirena members were expelled from the government, they 
would try the president. I ask him: Why didn't the Christian 
Democratic Party think that way when they left the government? 
The president has the power to dismiss or appoint whomever he 
chooses. 
  [Reporter] Mrs. Mireya, you said interests have prevailed 
within Molirena, but they say the Arnulfists.... 
  [De Gruber, interrupting] I must warn you that I did not say 
the interests of Molirena as a party have prevailed over those 
of the nation. 
  [Reporter] Under what circumstances would you negotiate with 
Professor Carles? 
  [De Gruber] We are ready to talk to all parties that want to 
come and talk to us. We are ready to talk to all parties except 
one. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Ruben Dario Carles, Change 94 Alliance </F>
presidential candidate, by Radio Soberana owner Alonso Pinzon 
and reporters Blas Julio and Juan Ramon Martinez at the studio 
in Panama City; from the "Crossfire" program; monitored in 
progress -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Pinzon] There is a question 
people are waiting for you to answer, and which we cannot avoid, 
and it has to do with the bases. Panama now must face the fact 
that the treaties will expire on the year 2000. No one has had 
the courage to speak up as Professor Carles has with regard to 
the bases, which are assets. We would like Prof. Carles to tell 
us what he will do with regard to the bases, what will be his 
government's initiative should he become president. 
  [Carles] Definitely, I believe the next government will face 
a very important period, perhaps the most important in the 
country's history. One of its main issues will be the operation 
and functioning of the Canal, the appropriate use of the 
reverted areas, and the decision on possible negotiations with 
the United States for leasing some of the sites the U.S. Army 
has occupied until now, and which must be vacated, according to 
the treaties. 
  I think we must stop talking nonsense. The United States has 
rights according to the neutrality treaty signed by Omar 
Torrijos -- and the Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD -- with 
the Carter administration. The U.S. Government has the 
following privileges according to the Nunn and DeConcini 
amendments: expeditious transit, which according to them means 
to be at the head of the line, and second, it has a right to 
intervene and return to Panama whenever it feels there is a 
justified reason, which it can easily interpret its own way. 
  I believe if someone occupying the basement or the attic my 
house must leave because his contract expires, but at the same 
time he can enter my house any time he wants because I 
authorized it, then it would be better for me to offer him a 
corner of my patio, but demanding certain concessions. You see, 
the Americans.... [pauses] please, gentlemen, let's face it: 
Omar Torrijos himself said so, he placed us under the 
Pentagon's umbrella. Why? Because he did not dare speak the 
truth. He gave the Americans the privilege of entering Panama 
whenever they fell like -- because they are the ones who will 
determine the circumstances -- in perpetuity, from here to 
eternity. 
  So, what's the problem? What we could do is tell them: We 
will lease you a piece of land at Howard airfield, or part of 
Kobbe. In exchange for that, you will authorize the entrance of 
Panamanian products, of thousands of tons of sugar, which will 
create jobs for so many people in the central provinces; 
thousands of tons of beef, which will benefit so many cattlemen 
in the interior of the country; more coffee, fruits, tobacco; 
guarantee the placement of banana shipments. We could also open 
markets for the Panamanian textile industry, which would help 
thousands of female operators who can sew top quality garments. 
We could sell guayaberas, shirts, underwear, pajamas in the 
United States if we have the quotas. What we could do is 
exchange a lease contract to operate Howard, for example, for a 
concession that would permit the hiring of 25,000 to 30,000 
Panamanians in textile factories currently not being used at 
full-capacity. That is what we must look for, gentlemen. 
Employment for our youths and opportunities for investment and 
production. 
  We must say this frankly. We want to negotiate with the 
Americans. Why talk about nationalism and sovereignty? 
Torrijos, the Panamanian officers and the PRD were always 
talking about nationalism and sovereignty, when in fact one of 
them was a CIA employee, and the other one negotiated a treaty 
that placed us under the Pentagon's umbrella. 
  [Pinzon] Would you immediately appoint a commission to take 
the initiative, to seek a formula, instead of waiting for them 
to act? 
  [Carles] Definitely. I already have chosen the three persons 
who would go to the United States to make contact with U.S. 
authorities. Don't listen to those who are saying that the 
gringos are not interested. They say.... [pauses] it is true 
that some diplomatic officials have said they are not 
interested, but what do the military forces have to say after 
all? Who decides? Torrijos already placed us under the 
Pentagon's umbrella. That treaty was signed by Carter and 
Torrijos. 
  [Pinzon] I believe that treaty also allowed them to 
intervene 
in 1989, in addition to the blunder committed by the drug 
trafficker. 
  [Carles] Of course. 
  [Julio] There is another interesting topic after the U.S. 
bases, which the thesis presented by Prof. Carles undoubtedly 
creates and fosters new hopes in the people that there will be 
new job opportunities. Prof. Carles, I have witnessed several 
meetings you have held with Indian leaders. The current 
problems faced by the Indian communities have turned chaotic, 
critical, disastrous. The Panamanian Indians claim they have 
been neglected. You have met with the main leaders of the 
various Indian communities. What can you tell us about those 
meetings? 
  [Carles] Indians are as Panamanian as we are. They have 
acquired representativeness, and they are very proud of their 
customs, traditions, and language, which we must respect and 
promote. They must feel that they are Panamanians, with their 
own characteristics. That occurs everywhere in the world. 
Families, even among us, maintain certain traditions, customs, 
and speak their native language. Once they join the country, 
respect the laws, and feel that they are Panamanian citizens, we 
must help them, especially with public services. The government 
must take care of their needs in education, health, housing, 
transportation, security, and protect them from vices, drugs, 
abuses, and criminals. That occurs in Indian communities in San 
Blas, Darien, Bocas del Toro, Chiriqui, and parts of Veraguas. 
We must respect them, support them, and help them join society. 
  The Panamanian Government -- not now, but during the past 
few 
years -- has sketched programs with other countries and 
international indigenous organizations. The funds, however, are 
not properly used. Those groups of Panamanians are deceived, as 
their needs for public services are not met. Millions of 
dollars were squandered under the military governments to make 
Indian communities believe they were receiving help. This 
happened in Veraguas, Chiriqui, and San Blas. We must tell 
those Panamanians: We have a plan for you, in which you can 
participate, and we will do it the right way. Forget it, 
politics is not eternal. Political campaigns are one thing, and 
another is working to find permanent solutions to the problems. 
  I have told those Panamanians in the indigenous groups that 
I 
will struggle on their side, respecting their Indian identity. 
I will help them, not doing what they themselves must do, but 
support them. It is better not to adopt paternalism, which 
creates dependency and in the long run does more harm than good, 
because it corrupts. The Indians and the state.... [pauses] in 
this case I could get funds from many international 
organizations, but they must start preparing to work in 
reforestation activities, environmental protection, ecology. 
They are a valuable resource, their living conditions are 
important from the standpoint of ecotourism and tourist 
attraction. They must participate, and not think that others 
will do the work for them. 
  There is a very interesting and important group residing 
here, which includes doctors, lawyers, sociologists, economists 
-- people who know. But they must start thinking in terms of 
Panamanians who are going to help their ethnic fellow men. The 
state must work together with the most capable and well-trained 
Indians; with those that deserve official support. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Alvaro Alvarado from the "The RPC Television </F>
News" newscast] 
  [Text] According to preliminary figures from the Statistics 
and Census Office of the Comptroller General's Office, 
unemployment dropped in 1993. President Guillermo Endara and 
Comptroller General Jose de los Santos Chen Barria unveiled the 
report today. The unemployment rate in 1988 was 16.3 percent. 
Five years later it is 12.5 percent, reflecting a downward 
trend. 
  [Begin Endara recording; in progress] ...a reduction in the 
unemployment rate. That means more Panamanians are employed. 
The fact that wages are going up is also very important to the 
people. The figure that I gave you on per capita income tells 
you what is happening. Panamanians are earning higher wages. 
[end recording] 
  The per capita GDP in 1988 was 755 balboas, whereas this 
year 
it 925 balboas, which is a 23 percent increase. Another 
important aspect is the relationship between wages and the labor 
sector. 
  [Begin Endara recording] The increase in wages in each of 
these segments has been greater than the increase in personnel. 
The number of personnel has risen as well as wages. [end 
recording] 
  The report concluded that areas such as construction, 
financial establishments, insurance, electricity, gas, and 
import rights experienced the greatest economic growth.

<F P=106> [Speech by Venezuelan President Ramon J. Velasquez to </F>
representatives of the Chambers of Deputies and Senate following 
the announcement of the start of a new period of Venezuelan 
National Congress regular sessions at the Sol del Peru Room of 
the Miraflores Presidential Palace in Caracas -- live] 
  [Text] Mr. Senate President and President of the National 
Congress; Mr. President of the Chamber of Deputies and Vice 
President of the National Congress; Dr. Felipe Montilla, 
president of the Senate Commission; Messrs. Senators; Dr. Pedro 
Tabata Guzman, president of the Chamber of Deputies Commission; 
Messrs. Deputies; Messrs. Ministers: 
  I would be lying if I denied the deep emotion I felt when 
listening to this morning's television debate. I saw in the 
debate that a new chapter in Venezuelan democracy was opening. 
All this time I have focused my efforts on fulfilling my duty 
to democracy, Venezuela, and the National Congress, which has 
given me enormous responsibility. 
  With his usual extraordinary voice, Dr. Felipe Montilla 
reminded me of the origin of that mandate and described the 
historic national climate of those hours. When I was sworn in I 
told my fellow members of parliament -- where I have spent most 
of my life as a politician during this democratic stage -- that 
a political storm had led me here and that at any moment the 
crisis could oust me, but my personal and political ethics would 
not be discredited. I wanted to fulfill the mandate and I 
wanted to avoid an interruption in the country's democracy, a 
process to which the country was committed. I was sure that more 
important than the painful conflict that brought us together was 
the Venezuelan willingness to live in freedom. I was also sure 
of the powers of the democratic process of perfection and 
correction. 
  A dictatorship would have been unable to face the crises 
that 
the Venezuelan democratic system faced throughout 1992-93. It 
was a series of political, military, and social factors and it 
was within a climate of exacerbation, and for many, a climate of 
defeat and disorientation. 
  However, above that atmosphere stood Venezuelan society's 
resolve, which had been tested during that process and is open 
to the admission of new political and social forces which are 
gradually appearing in an increasingly developing Venezuela. 
  Contrary to other Latin American countries, where 
traditional 
parties have attempted to close ranks and exclude the new forces 
emerging from development itself from political debate and 
democratic and legal participation, Venezuelan democracy has 
opened up this participation, allowing new challenges for the 
country to be stated from their platforms. 
  In a process currently criticized by many as frustrating, 
this democracy has accomplished that which certain people were 
determined to achieve since 1936. From exile, the founding 
leaders of the democratic process pointed out the need to have a 
school in each village, a high school in each town, and a 
university in every state capital, so that through learning we 
could change the traditional education system and, therefore, 
change the system whereby the country was ruled by a very small 
group. 
  Democracy has allowed this magnificent opening whereby each 
region designates its governor and every community its mayor. 
Democracy has gradually led to the growing participation of 
civilian society. There have been mistakes, failings, 
corruption and influence peddling, but complaints, lawsuits and 
democratic society's watchfulness have corrected those defects 
and created a critical awareness among Venezuelans in response 
to those negative attitudes. This had to be protected; the 
democratic process could not be interrupted because to do so 
would hinder Venezuelan society's end-of-century plans. 
  If my administration was hesitant and weak, it is because 
democracy is hesitant and weak. It is hesitant because to make 
a decision it must consult with all of the sectors; it is weak 
because it must accept [the will of those sectors], but its 
weakness is ironclad; it does not break. Only authoritarian 
regimes can boast a strength that translates into arbitrariness 
and the will of one person against the community. 
  When I see the accusations that have been leveled against 
Congress and against political activity in Venezuela, perhaps 
because I am a researcher of history and have participated in 
lengthy episodes, I can only look back at the political activity 
of this century to see how the political strength of congress, 
the political parties, the news media, and the opposition have 
gradually undermined the bad habits, cunning, and hindrances 
that blocked the development of Venezuelan society for almost 
two centuries. 
  This is a society on the move because it has the 
watchfulness of democracy through the parliament, through the 
constant denunciations and complaints by the media. It is 
preferable to have exaggerations than silence. 
  Venezuelan democracy is the fruit of a painful experience 
because what was attained in the end was what successive 
generations since the 19th century and until the sixties of this 
century wanted to have, to live with liberty and dignity. 
  Messrs. Senators and Deputies, you will start legislative 
sessions at a very difficult time in national life, because the 
threats facing the country are not traditional conspiracies or 
attempts to frustrate the process but problems such as the 
country's fiscal situation. 
  To fulfill the mandate of the Congress of the Special Powers 
Law, I, together with the Council of Minister and with the 
attendance of the most renown lawyers of the country, assumed 
the responsibility of promulgating the laws that the Congress 
pointed out to me, including tax laws, because it is necessary 
to say that in light of the demands of development, social 
demands, the state's commitments, the income from petroleum 
today is not capable, as it was in the recent past, of 
fulfilling those demands. Those demands are now on the 
government's table. 
  Tax collection is necessary. It will not be done through the 
taxes we promulgated with the Special Powers Law but, as one of 
the new parliament's immediate tasks, it must undertake a study 
of the fiscal paths that would allow the state to immediately 
tend to the problems, its own administrative problems as well as 
the social problems that have been pointed out; the problems 
related to the salaries and the cost of living. 
  On the other hand, it is indispensable -- I confirmed this 
need in its real dimensions -- to deal with the social problem, 
the poverty problem, because there can be no perfect political 
democracy if the wood worm of social disaster, which is created 
by poverty, is at the base of that democracy. As far as I am 
concerned, this has been an extraordinary watch tower, an 
observatory, as well as an information bureau. This is the case 
because just as I was able to establish a dialogue here with the 
political parties, I have also been able to meet with the 
economic sectors, other sectors of the population and other 
social sectors that allowed me to have a good idea of the 
Venezuelan social crisis. 
  The best way to reaffirm democracy, ensure that it can 
extend 
to the next century and ensure sustained growth is by finding 
solutions to the fiscal, social, and poverty problems in 
Venezuela. I truthfully say.... [pauses] I am aware that it is 
inappropriate to use certain words especially during addresses 
such as this one, but I am going to do it anyway because I am 
addressing persons who were my parliamentary companions for so 
many years. I want to say that I am ending my term quite 
content. I am content because I have been able to witness the 
arrival here at the Sol del Peru Room, of those legitimate 
representatives of the new political and national country that 
you represent. This means that Venezuelan democracy has been 
able to pass through a dark tunnel which opened the way to all 
sorts of sneak attacks, and every dishonest conduct imaginable 
aimed at preventing the country from progressing. 
  Your presence here on this 23 January 1994 is evidence of 
democracy's strength. Your presence here and the incorporation 
of the new political organizations, the presence of new 
parliamentarians and the parliamentary youths, is the best 
evidence of a new year. Venezuela's destiny is in your hands 
because, as has already been said by the presidents of the great 
commissions, we have arrived at a moment of understanding. I 
was telling the president-elect that when he is preparing to 
announce his programs, he should first ensure a national 
agreement. It is indispensable that we reach a national 
agreement in Venezuela. Problems are so serious and there is so 
little time, that truce and understanding are indispensable. 
  It is not a matter of distributing public posts, ministries 
or embassies. That makes no sense whatsoever. I am referring 
to an agreement about the country's fundamental problems, the 
solution of which can wait no longer. The voice of every sector 
must be heard. As legitimate representatives of the country's 
regions and opinions, the national agreement must find in each 
of you its champions and guarantors. 
  In concluding this address, I would like to deeply thank 
Senator Montilla for his generous words and offer that I will be 
able to return as always, as if it were my home. Thank you. 
Good evening.

  [Text] Barquesimeto -- Approximately 80,000 transportation 
workers in 11 states will initiate an indefinite transportation 
strike tomorrow on city and inter-city routes to protest the 
government's delay in resolving the problems they have been 
facing for so long. 
  Erik Zuleta, general secretary of the Lara Automotive Union, 
reported that at the meeting held by the Bloc of Transportation 
Unions of the Central and Central-Eastern States, it was agreed 
to initiate the strike as of Tuesday. This move will leave the 
following states without public transportation along city and 
inter-city routes: Tachira, Merida, Trujillo, Falcon, Zulia, 
Barinas, Portuguesa, Yaracuy, Apure, Cojedes, and Lara, as well 
as part of Carabobo. 
  Zuleta said the transportation strike will hit the nation's 
central area, the central-western region, the Andes, and the 
western flatlands. The strike will be staged indefinitely until 
the Transportation and Communications Ministry responds to a 
document turned over by Fedetransporte [expansion unknown] in 
October in which the problems of more than 80,000 transportation 
sector workers are spelled out. The demands include an increase 
in the minimum wage, the elimination of the VAT [value-added 
tax], and that the state absorb the cost of the student tariff. 
Zuleta indicated that the transportation workers are not 
willing to continue subsidizing this service that should be 
assumed by the government. 
  In addition, the secretary general of the Lara Automotive 
Union said that one of the main points for resolving the tariff 
problem is the need for the government to establish official 
tariffs for urban, suburban, metropolitan, and countryside 
transportation. The decision made by the Bloc of Transportation 
Unions has already been made. The strike will be initiated on 
Tuesday for an indefinite period until the bloc receives a 
satisfactory reply from the government. The workers have been 
waiting for this reply for three months.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 25 
January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item: 
  Lagoven, a subsidiary of Petroven, announced that output at 
the Bachaquero Sur-Oeste oil field increased to 3,100 barrels 
per day after four new wells were opened in the Lake Maracaibo 
area, Zulia Department. The Lagoven engineering department 
disclosed that the new wells had increased production by 2,300 
barrels per day in 1993. In 1992, Lagoven discovered crude oil 
that rated 45 API, which in its test phase incorporated 18 
million barrels of reserve petroleum. The company intends to 
drill seven new wells this year. (Caracas EL GLOBO in Spanish 
23 Jan 94 p 11) 
  Petroven announced a $0.50-per barrel increase in export 
crude as well as other products, thus raising the price of 
export crude to $12.20 per barrel. Petroven management 
explained that the price increase was due to an increase in 
demand brought about by colder weather in the United States and 
Europe. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 18 Jan 94 p E-5) 
  The Finance Ministry Public Finances Department reported 
that 
Venezuela canceled $2.685 billion in foreign debt service during 
fiscal year 1993. Of the total amount paid as part of the 
country's foreign debt services, $2.11130 billion, or 78.62 
percent, corresponds to unstructured debt, while $1.05868 
billion, or 39.42 percent, corresponds to restructured debt. 
The report also discloses that capital payments totalled $1.176 
billion, while interest payments amounted to $1.508 billion. 
Foreign debt balances during 1993 totaled $27.296 billion as 
opposed to $27.08290 billion during 1992. (Caracas EL GLOBO in 
Spanish 17 Jan 94 p 13) 
  Lagoven announced that crude oil and by-product exports 
increased to 797,000 barrels per day in 1993. According to 
Daniel Ramirez, manager of Lagoven Commerce and Supply 
Department, the company was able to increase its exports by 
37,000 barrels per day compared to 1992 exports. On the other 
hand, export revenues fell during 1993 due to excess supply as a 
result of OPEC and North Sea overproduction and greater than 
expected exports to Russia. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 0029 GMT 18

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] The first hint of the political cataclysm brought on 
by these elections comes from an examination of the accompanying 
table. It highlights the differences between the 1989-94 
legislature and the one that will sit from 1994 to 1999. 
Although a few details remain to be worked out concerning 
proportional representation and the inclusion of other 
minigroups or personalities, the character of the new congress 
can now be discerned. A reader offended by the way the table 
treats one group or another may safely change some names. This, 
it seems to me, will do little harm since, from a structural 
standpoint, the results will remain the same. The congress will 
still be made up of four major blocks. The largest will hold 30 
percent of the seats and the others around 20 percent each. 
  This means that for the time being it will take an agreement 
among at least three blocks to get a quorum in the Chamber of 
Deputies. The MAS [Movement Toward Socialism] block becomes 
decisive. To gain a quorum or develop any sort of legislative 
program, the other two coalitions will have to court MAS and win 
it over. This situation resembles the previous session in both 
the Chamber and the Senate with one very important exception. 
Before, only one group needed the socialists, and the 
socialists, for their part, were in competition with New 
Democratic Generation [NGD]. In practice this resulted in a 
dominant coalition made up of AD and the group led by Wladimir 
Gessen, who has now retired to the practice of psychology. For 
its part, COPEI's [Social Christian Party] alliance with MAS 
could not proceed on its own. COPEI had to seek more support 
elsewhere, and help was hard to come by. This meant the congress 
tended to follow the lead of AD with support from NGD. 
  By contrast, in the new Senate, if the two largest groups 
act 
as a block, they will not have to look to a third group for 
support. If this happens, then the block composed of the next 
two largest groups will be obliged to seek support from a third 
group. In addition, as the table shows, a three-way accord among 
Convergence, Causa R, and MAS will not produce a majority. It is 
possible to speculate about other combinations, too, but the 
point remains that agreements will be hard to reach and 
maintaining a smooth flow of legislative business in the new 
session will not be easy. 
  This outlook, although it may seem a bit alarming, is also 
rather static. We are assuming there will be no breaking of 
ranks within the parties that have won seats. However, there are 
reasons to believe this is not very likely. Take COPEI, for 
example. It will be under pressure from Convergence, and some of 
its followers may decide to leave the fold rather than oppose a 
"social christian" government headed by the founder of their own 
party. However, this is a two-way street. In the long run, COPEI 
could pick up defectors from Convergence as some lawmakers grow 
disenchanted with the government or find other reasons to shift 
allegiances. Causa R has undergone explosive growth, and it 
remains to be seen if new members assimilate and toe the line. 
Experience indicates that this sort of movement that sweeps into 
existence with no clear ideology is prone to division. Given the 
likelihood of a fluid situation, the party with the most to gain 
is clearly AD since it is less susceptible to erosion either 
from within or without. Stability gives AD lots of resources and 
plenty of bargaining chips. 
  But that is not all. A new factor that must be considered is 
that half the members of the new Chamber represent single-member 
districts, and this poses a threat to parliamentary cohesion. 
Representatives of single-member districts regard themselves as 
first-class lawmakers who won office on their own merits and by 
forging personal ties to those who elected them. This gives them 
a great deal of liberty in the face of pressure to toe the party 
line. 
  All these factors presage a Congress that is highly 
unpredictable and hard to rule. Paradoxically, however, this 
could offer a way out of some of the problems of governing and 
legislative relations that are bound to arise in the coming 
year. Despite the prospect of some ugly spectacles, there is 
reason to hope that defection, restructuring, and realignment 
will combine to produce a pro-government alliance or an 
opposition open to constructive agreement on certain basic 
issues. There is, however, another scenario to be considered. 
The president-elect has reserves of prestige, ability, and 
tenacity that transcend the election results. Intensive use of 
this political capital could put Congress on the defensive in 
the eyes of public opinion and force the creation of blocks and 
coalitions that seem unimaginable at present. Or the president 
could use his political capital to promote constitutional 
reforms and press for the innovations of which he seems fondest. 
These include referendums and the possibility of being able to 
dissolve legislatures. Changes such as these would alter 
completely the picture painted here. For a task of such 
magnitude, the first months of the new administration will be 
decisive. 
  For any of these developments to take place, there will have 
to be an arduous process of negotiations of all sorts. The costs 
of these transactions will, as the economists say, be enormous. 
It would be nice if the president had at his side someone like 
Richelieu to keep him from being consumed by such an engrossing 
task. The president badly needs someone who would let him 
concentrate on problem-solving and substantive matters of 
policy. However, he has no such partner anywhere in sight.

<F P=106> [Article by Rosita Regalado] </F>
  [Text] Antonio Rios was ready to modernize upon returning 
to his job as CTV [Venezuelan Workers Confederation] president. 
He was prepared to take part in a great debate with business 
aimed at solving the problem of retroactive entitlements. This 
is the foundation for the national consensus urged by 
President-elect Rafael Caldera. In exchange, Rios promises the 
country an end to labor and social strife. 
  Yesterday morning the executive committee room at CTV 
headquarters was the scene of an emotional event. Angel Zerpa 
Mirabal, the confederation's acting president, handed over his 
post to Antonio Rios, the man who served 14 months in jail on an 
influence peddling conviction. Upon his arrival, Rio got a warm 
reception from fellow committee members and others close to the 
Venezuelan labor movement. The one exception was Carlos 
Magdaleno, the executive committee's foremost member. Holding a 
copy of the body's statutes, he insisted that Rios could not 
assume its presidency. As a sign of protest, Magdaleno walked 
out of the press conference given by Rios. 
  The labor leader reiterated what he said to his labor 
colleagues minutes earlier. He repeated his belief that he was 
the victim of a national and international conspiracy to weaken 
the CTV. He denied that the attack could have been aimed at him 
personally because he had committed no offense. 
  "Since the case remains open and my prosecutors, rather than 
act on good faith, have conducted themselves as accusers, I will 
continue to demonstrate that I have committed no offense. There 
are many facts that deserve prompt prosecutorial attention. They 
include the disclosures of Dr. Esperanza Martino concerning the 
three financial groups that embezzled over a billion bolivars 
without a single arrest. 
  "Today," Rios said, "I assume my duties, not with any sense 
of arrogance, but in the same spirit of service and teamwork 
that I have always had when seeking to improve the plight of 
labor. Venezuela is in a period that demands commitment and 
responsibility from the CTV. It must be ready to talk with the 
president-elect, his administration, and all other sectors about 
the accord that will show the way though the serious crisis now 
afflicting the country. I am convinced of the need for a broad 
national agreement on how to overcome these difficulties." 
  Rios also emphasized his belief that labor has a pressing 
need for modernization in order to meet workers' current needs. 
These needs are different from those of the past, he said, and 
they require reforms that give labor the power to negotiate new 
working conditions. 
  "The time has come to warn public employees that they are in 
danger of falling victim to the sort of crime that I have been 
accused of. This is why the best that can come of what happened 
to me is for solidarity to become synonymous with the Venezuelan 
labor movement. I must tell you of my reflections during my 14 
months in prison. I submit that the CTV and all unions must 
become independent of political parties and their economic 
resources without delay. This is the way to eliminate once and 
for all any reliance on partisan politics in the making of 
decisions that are strictly labor-related." 
  In handing over the CTV presidency, Angel Zerpa Mirabal 
noted 
that the International Labor Organization sees the Rios case as 
a clear human rights violation and will take up the matter at 
its December meeting. 
  [Regalado] Would you be willing to discuss retroactivity and 
lower demands for wage hikes as part of a national accord while 
the country solves its fiscal deficit? 
  [Rios] That is possible and necessary, but it must be done 
as 
part of a broad agreement with both wages and prices on the same 
table. It is not fair to freeze wages and let prices go free. 
The need is for a broad agreement covering an ample basket of 
goods and agreed-upon wages. This gives wages room to move if 
prices rise so long as the country remains in crisis. Willpower 
on the part of government and business is the key. 
  [Regalado] What do you think of the position MAS [Movement 
Toward Socialism] has taken on the executive committee against 
your taking over the CTV presidency? 
  [Rios] I have no knowledge of this. I would ask them to 
modify their position since everyone knows I am innocent. I 
would refer them to Eloy Torres, who is sure of my innocence. 
  [Regalado] Would the national accord include elimination of 
retroactive entitlements? 
  [Rios] I have always said that laws are made to be improved 
through revision except in the area of social entitlements. Talk 
of their elimination came up when I was under attack, and I took 
it as a maneuver against me. But I still regard the entitlement 
law as no different from others that are susceptible to 
modification. This is something that can be debated. The fact is 
that entitlements are all workers have. This is why there is so 
much resistance to changing them. 
  But I do understand that modifications are necessary because 
today retroactivity is a drain on public and private resources 
that could lead to insolvency. Big business has something set 
aside for such a contingency. This is what makes modification 
necessary. But it cannot be just a way to meet needs or solve 
problems for business. It must also improve the lot of workers. 
I am sure my colleagues on the CTV executive committee would be 
open to discussion.

<F P=106> [Article by Alfredo Carquez Saavedra] </F>
  [Text] Only 5 percent of Venezuela's corporations pay what 
they really owe in income taxes. 
  This is because most companies declare losses every year. If 
they admit to making money, they report earnings in the bracket 
with a top rate of 20 percent. 
  This profile, which better resembles a nation in Africa, is 
unreal. In Venezuela, it is simply a matter of not paying taxes 
because of loopholes in the law and because the agency that does 
the collecting has also fallen victim to the crisis. 
  These are the conclusions of Gustavo Garcia, who teaches at 
the Institute of Higher Administrative Studies (IESA). Garcia 
recently completed an investigation of the Venezuelan tax system 
for the World Bank. 
  "Corporations pose a very serious problem," he said. "Tax 
evasion rates are extremely high. Some 23 percent of the 
businesses that file returns claim losses. This is happening in 
a business world of some 250,000 corporate entities." 
  "In addition, almost 60 percent report earnings of between 
one and 500,000 bolivars. In all, 83 percent of the businesses 
that file returns are reporting either losses or earnings of 
under 500,000 bolivars a year. A scant 4.8 percent claim annual 
earnings of between a million and two million bolivars." 
  Garcia noted that the latest version of the income tax dates 
from 1991. Under 1991 rules, the rate for businesses that earn 
under two million bolivars is 20 percent, not the maximum rate 
of 30 percent. 
  "And if you count how many claim profits of between one 
bolivar and two million bolivars," he said, "it turns out that 
73 percent of the firms filing returns pay at the 20 percent 
rate. 
  [Carquez] Does this mean that only 5 percent of corporations 
are paying what they really owe? 
  [Garcia] Precisely. This is the 5 percent that reports 
earnings of over 2 million bolivars. 
  [Carquez] But that is unreal. It makes Venezuela look like 
some country in Africa. 
  [Garcia] If it were true, the nation would be bankrupt. The 
average corporation pays 281,343 bolivars in income tax, a 
figure comparable to the most backwards countries in Africa. 
  This comes to $3,517 at the 1992 exchange rate. If company 
earnings average this little for a whole year, then they are all 
broke. In constant 1984 prices, it works out to 29,826 bolivars, 
which at that year's exchange rate is $2,983. However, there are 
also companies that pay high taxes due to the political and 
economic fallout that comes from looking like tax dodgers. 
  This shows that the margin for avoiding and eluding taxes is 
enormous. Many taxpayers do not just break the law. They also 
take advantage of all its shortcomings to lower their tax burden. 
  [Carquez] What must be done about taxes? 
  [Garcia] Except for oil companies, what you see in the 
Venezuelan tax system is a persistent drop in collections from 
both individuals and corporations since 1986. This reflects the 
extremely high rate of tax evasion in Venezuela. 
  Evasion slashes potential revenues from corporate taxes by 
about two thirds. The rate is lower for individuals, but 
figuring out how much lower is far more complicated. 
  The reasons Garcia gives for tax evasion include: weak laws; 
poor administration; and limitations in the tax code itself. 
These, he said, "have been building up over time and got even 
worse during the latest overhaul." 
  Garcia called the value added tax and the corporate assets 
tax fundamental to the modernization process. But he warned that 
major shortcomings remain. They make tax collection more 
difficult because the political will is missing to beef up the 
agencies that run the Venezuelan tax system. 
  To make up for lost income tax collections, the government 
has resorted to other taxes, and this has led to huge economic 
distortions. 
  "With income tax revenues on the slide, payroll taxes have 
gone up significantly. This partly explains the erosion of real 
wages in Venezuela and social unrest. Moreover," Garcia said, 
"the taxes have not been offset by improvements in the services 
for which they were collected." 
  Payroll taxes have gone up even faster then the rate of 
inflation, he noted. The 1989 cap of 3,000 bolivars on social 
security deductions first climbed to 15,000 and last year 
reached 45,000. 
  "And even though tax hikes were necessary," he said, "the 
problem is that payroll taxes were the only ones that rose. 
  "The problem is that there is a direct tax on work. This 
combined with the system of social benefits makes jobs more 
expensive in Venezuela. So companies tend not to raise wages 
because it also raises their liabilities. Every increase 
triggers a jump of 18 percent in the payroll tax." 
  Adding payroll and income taxes together shows how much 
individuals are paying. "Only those with incomes above 2,000,500 
bolivars a year pay taxes comparable to the deductions from the 
wages of workers making less than 45,000 bolivars a month. 
  "Instead of direct taxes on those with higher earnings, they 
are imposing more direct taxes on workers. The Venezuelan tax 
system has strongly contributed to lower wages by overtaxing 
work while losing its ability to collect from individuals." 
  Once the value added tax and the tax on corporate assets are 
approved, Garcia expects they will help ease the tax situation 
in Venezuela. That will leave the income tax in need of three 
major reforms. 
  Drastic measures are needed to eliminate exemptions, such as 
the one for agriculture, that are still on the books. Slashes 
are also needed in the deductions allowed as investment 
incentives and in many personal tax deductions. 
  When the income tax reform took effect, he recalled, the 
number of individual taxpayers dropped from 1.3 million in 1991 
to only 350,000 in 1992. 
  "We tax 1.75 percent of a population of 20 million and 5.4 
percent of the work force," he pointed out. 
  Garcia thinks the cap on payroll taxes must go. He wants 
this 
done in order to benefit workers, not companies, and he wants 
tax delinquency to be punished. 
  "The problem here is that the only sanction with a jail term 
is the one against tax collectors who keep the money. It is 
curious that in Venezuela violations of the tax laws are not 
regarded as crimes," he said. 
  Likewise, he added, the agency that collects the taxes has 
to 
be fully autonomous. It must be autonomous administratively, and 
it must have its own budget. The way to achieve this is to give 
the agency a budget equal to a percentage of "between 2 and 3 
percent" of revenues from nonpetroleum taxes.

<F P=106> [Interview with Zulia State Governor Lolita Aniyar by Felipe </F>
Saldivia; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Saldivia] You had not planned to devote yourself to 
politics, but you now find yourself the governor-elect. Was all 
of this an accident? 
  [Aniyar] Yes, these are the pitfalls of life. It was not in 
my plans for it to end this way. I did indeed engage in politics 
when I was very young. At the end of the dictatorship, I served 
for three years in the Legislative Assembly of the State of 
Zulia, but this was so many years ago that, practically 
speaking, it is no longer a part of my life--just a memory. I 
have devoted all of my time to the university. Almost without 
realizing it, I found myself involved in the world of politics, 
because if one feels one is in direct contact with the problems 
of the country, as one should be, the time comes when one cannot 
abstain from setting his hand to the possible solution of those 
problems. And one day, I realized that, almost without knowing 
how, I had accepted the government candidacy, and now I find 
myself the governor-elect. All of these things continue to 
surprise me, because in my political life, I have always been a 
spectator. I watched myself and what was happening to me as if I 
were observing it all from the outside. 
  [Saldivia] You still do not see from within? 
  [Aniyar] I know that I am on the inside, but I have a 
strange 
ability to see myself from the outside. 
  [Saldivia] And how do you see yourself? 
  [Aniyar] As an individual attempting to battle for the 
things 
in which she believes, in a political world in which almost no 
one believes in these things. The proof that this is so is that 
despite the fact that there have been very clear victories in 
these elections, and the people have indicated that they still 
see a potential in democracy, I am currently witnessing actions 
by the traditional old politicians who do not know how to lose, 
and who are trying to muddy a process that was clear and honest. 
And thus one wonders if there are still participants in this old 
political story who are finding it hard to accept defeat, who 
are clinging to the old procedures, and who do not see what is 
happening in the country. 
  [Saldivia] What is happening in Zulia? 
  [Aniyar] The same thing that is happening all over the 
country. There is a great sense of weariness with the 
corruption, the omnipotence, and the imported macroeconomic 
schemes that have nothing to do with the reality here, as well 
as rage at the total crisis. 
  [Saldivia] Why did the COPEI [Social Christian Party] lose, 
while a year ago, it won yet again? Was Oswaldo Alvarez Paz 
simply the winner? 
  [Aniyar] Zulia is a state that has always pursued a search 
for alternative leaderships, which were not always available to 
it. An opportunity came when Luis Homez ran as a candidate for 
government office, but it died at the end of the electoral 
campaign. From that time on, no alternative leadership was 
available until mine emerged. 
  [Saldivia] Who was the last MAS [Movement Toward Socialism] 
candidate? 
  [Aniyar] Juvencio Pulgar, of course, together with Oswaldo 
Alvarez Paz today. And I have the impression that he won the 
votes that Oswaldo Alvarez Paz still had away from him. 
  [Saldivia] What are the specific problems pertaining to your 
election today? 
  [Aniyar] The election results have been recognized by all 
the 
parties except the COPEI. The obstacle is the fact that Leonardo 
Ferrer does not want to admit he lost and came in third. He went 
to the CSE [Supreme Electoral Council] to demand that it impugn 
400 election certificates. This is very funny, because those who 
are challenging these documents are alleging electoral crimes 
committed by people in their own party. It was they who were the 
presidents and secretaries of the election boards--those who 
doubtless gave the orders to affix one more signature, or one 
less seal. This plot was organized well in advance, because they 
knew four months ago when I entered the contest that I was 
leading in the polls. Do you want me to tell you the truth? What 
is happening is that they are trying to put matters in order 
before I take government office. There is great concern because 
I have said that I am going to ask for an audit. I have had no 
input in the 1994 budget, which will cover a half of my term of 
office. It is made up of current and payroll expenditures, with 
a minimum amount for investment--and that, by the way, is being 
seriously threatened. This is very serious, because if I cannot 
express my views about the budget that is going to govern my 
administration, this will prevent me from resolving any of the 
problems of the state. They are working to ruin my 
administration. What we are seeing is a delaying maneuver. 
  [Saldivia] What do you mean by the phrase "putting matters 
in 
order"? Do you believe, then, that Oswaldo Alvarez Paz has 
embarked upon some peculiar manipulation process? 
  [Aniyar] Yes. This government in Zulia is known as the 
10-percent government. It turned into the 20-percent government 
as the campaign approached, thanks to the tribute exacted from 
the public works contractors. Incidentally, one of the elements 
in my electoral campaign, which was of course oriented toward 
explaining that it is possible to govern without corruption, was 
precisely a specific offer to resolve the problem of harassment 
and commissions on public projects. That, among other things. 
The payrolls here have been artificially inflated. The names of 
individuals who are not experts in their sectors have been 
added. For example, there are individuals on the orchestra 
payroll who are not musicians. They have just nervously sworn in 
more than 500 individuals who were allegedly hired some time 
ago. It must be presumed that the accounting processes were 
backdated. Officials are giving jobs to their friends, to their 
little party comrades. This is extremely serious. This 
phenomenon can be seen in other state governments as well, and 
it is very difficult to change because of this evil tradition of 
inflating the payrolls. Each governor brings in his own team and 
then, when he departs, leaves it behind. 
  [Saldivia] And with what team will you be working? That left 
behind by Oswaldo Alvarez Paz? 
  [Aniyar] With the decent team Oswaldo left behind and 
staffers other governors left in place. With the exception of 
the top segment of the payroll, which will be made up of my 
trusted advisers. But I will not allow anyone to be included on 
the official payroll who has been put there fraudulently, or who 
is not actually working. 
  [Saldivia] Do you plan to maintain some distance from the 
MAS 
in your work in the government, as Governor Tablante did? 
  [Aniyar] No, I have a staff already selected, and it is 
basically independent. There is one MAS member and one from the 
Convergence, while the others are independents. They are all 
people whose orientation in politics is similar to mine and to 
that of the MAS. Because it must be realized that they all have 
the same point of view about an alternative in politics. They 
are all individuals with a 21st-century mentality. I am an 
independent, but this does not mean that I will turn my back on 
the MAS in governing, because it has provided me with good 
support and an excellent apprenticeship in honesty and political 
commitment. All I have learned I learned in the MAS faction as a 
senator. Therefore, the counsel of the MAS continues to be 
welcomed, but my independence is not to be challenged. 
  [Saldivia] What mistakes that the MAS governors made do you 
plan to avoid repeating? 
  [Aniyar] I do not think there were errors. Each governor has 
his own way of doing things. I am not like Tablante, but I have 
seen that he developed a government with very effective social 
policies that I would like to understand fully so as to use them 
if they are suitable for Zulia. In the same way, the policies 
implemented by Andres Velasquez in Bolivar were effective. And I 
can also learn about some things done in the health sector in 
the states of Anzoategui and Carabobo, and about what has been 
done in education in Bolivar and Merida. 
  [Saldivia] Could it be said that you owe your place in 
government to Jaime Lusinchi, because of the role you played 
with regard to the accusations made? 
  [Aniyar] No, because this is not the only thing I have done 
in my political life. I did extraordinary work (and I do not 
feel immodest in saying so) in the health sector when I served 
as president of the Senate Health Commission for two years. We 
faced up to the need for a complete package in the health 
sector, a life-and-death issue. And that is the proper term for 
it. In this connection, I was able to make contact with the most 
dramatic reality--the life and death of the individual citizen. 
I believe that it was this--the possibility of having some 
impact in this sector--that led me to accept, deep within 
myself, the candidacy for government office. In addition, I have 
a long history as a university professor in the state of Zulia, 
and a 10-year career as a writer for the local daily newspapers. 
This has created for me a host of invisible friends, as Uslar 
Pietri has said. 
  [Saldivia] Are you the moral conscience of Zulia? 
  [Aniyar] I do not know. That seems a bit of an exaggeration. 
I am indeed seen as occupying a different position, from the 
point of view of stating and interpreting matters, and as a 
result I have succeeded in identifying with many citizens. 
  [Saldivia] Didn't Alvarez Paz do more good for Zulia than 
the 
personally appointed governors? 
  [Aniyar] Absolutely not. 
  [Saldivia] Do you mean that the process of direct election 
is 
only beginning to serve Zulia now? 
  [Aniyar] No. The situation in Zulia is very special. I say 
that Zulia is like a country. 
  [Saldivia] The people will think you are a separatist. 
  [Aniyar] Zulia has declared itself an independent republic 
three times in history. 
  [Saldivia] And do you advocate this? 
  [Aniyar] No, but that is what the history of Zulia shows, 
and 
the citizens of Zulia have always wanted to be different from 
the citizens of the rest of the country. Oswaldo discovered that 
this was an important thing for Zulia, and he greatly encouraged 
this state feeling. He exploited the sense of loyalty to Zulia, 
the feeling that Zulia has given everything and received 
nothing, because the country lives off the production of Zulia, 
its oil and farm output, while it only receives the same as any 
other sad state in the country. That is the truth, and at the 
present time, Zulia is one of the 10 poorest states in 
Venezuela. Oswaldo speculated with this situation, and said that 
he would make Zulia "the seat of Venezuela." However, what he 
did was to make it the poorest place in Venezuela, because the 
figures now reveal a catastrophic situation. He described 
himself as the first citizen of Zulia, which was quite offensive 
to the people of Zulia. He promulgated some ostentatious 
measures, for example his decree that the history and geography 
of Zulia would be studied in the schools. This was a plan, by 
the way, that was never realized. He created a state flag, and 
in the last electoral campaign, everything was based on the fact 
that Zulia would have a president. He speculated with this 
situation, and neglected the concrete real situation being 
experienced by the Zulian citizen, who saw that everything was 
catastrophic. The citizen of Zulia is a very emotional 
individual, and this was the reason for the voting support I had 
in Zulia. 
  [Saldivia] Are you planning on an administration of two or 
five years? 
  [Aniyar] My hope is for five, to parallel the five years of 
President Caldera's constitutional mandate. A two-year 
administration makes no sense, for one can only begin to work in 
that time. And so I hope that this confidence in me will last, 
despite the obstacles being placed in my way. I believe that it 
will last, because the vote of the Zulian citizen is very 
emotional, and those who voted for me were emotional as well. In 
fact, there were a number of Oswaldo-Lolita votes. The people do 
not vote a straight ticket. That has come to an end in 
Venezuela. There were also Claudio-Lolita and Andres 
Velasquez-Lolita votes, because Causa R instructed its 
supporters to vote for me. And, of course, there were many 
Caldera-Lolita votes.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Teodoro Petkoff: "Caldera and the MAS Now"] </F>
  [Text] During the electoral campaign, there was an effort 
to discredit the participation of the MAS [Movement Toward 
Socialism] in the game by noting the similarities to the 
operations, seen so often in Venezuelan politics, carried out by 
certain political forces that have leaned against the strongest 
tree solely in the hope of surviving. In this connection, it 
would be well to remember that the closer relations between the 
MAS and Caldera began in 1989. It was then that the idea was 
gaining ground among us that a break between Caldera and his 
party--barely perceptible at that time--would inevitably mean a 
significant change in the Venezuelan political-party picture, 
creating the conditions for the development of a wide breach in 
the bipartisan wall. This strategic option took on an additional 
dimension after the events of 4 February, when it became clear 
that the bar could be set even higher. Caldera's candidacy could 
serve as the focus of a confluence of forces capable of 
defeating bipartisanism, rather than simply breaching it. And so 
then, as of 1990, the country began to see movement toward 
creating an alliance. There were sporadic and calculated 
statements by some MAS leaders, as well as Caldera himself, 
indicating willingness to attend a meeting. There was the noisy 
presence of Caldera at the MAS convention in Los Caracas in July 
of 1990 (when the group of leaders gathered there 
enthusiastically made it clear how far their preferences went, 
and Caldera made a point of his conviction that an agreement 
with the MAS would not by any means displease him). And there 
was even the folkloric detail, in the best sense of the word, of 
the domino game with Caldera, which said more than 100 articles 
ever could have. 
  It is clear, then, that Caldera's victory constituted a 
political success of no small importance for the MAS--perhaps 
the greatest in its history, along with the achievement of its 
own birth. Prejudices, misunderstandings, and a certain leftist 
inertia had to be overcome both within and outside the MAS to 
make possible the crystallization of that strategic achievement 
represented by the perception of the tremendous potential in the 
"non-COPEI [Social Christian Party]" candidacy of Caldera. But 
it should be noted that the veteran leader also had to face 
prejudices, misunderstandings, and a certain conservative 
inertia in order to facilitate a convergence with the MAS, and 
then with other lesser forces, without which he knew perfectly 
well he could not win. In this connection, Caldera's vision of 
the breadth of the alliance and his courage in maintaining his 
standards, although he knew that his adversaries would attempt 
to exploit his alliance with "the communists" to discredit him 
with his traditional supporters, provide the measure of the 
courage of this leader and statesman. 
  In all of his speeches and televised appearances, Caldera 
took pains to emphasize the presence of each of his supporters. 
He began with the MAS, and always ended with a respectful and 
very courageous reference to the PCV [Communist Party of 
Venezuela]. This provided a lesson not only for a country that 
urgently needed to put sectarianism and subordinate quarrels 
behind it, but also, most certainly, for those who were not 
clear in their own minds that his victory would only be possible 
if the votes of every little faction, however modest, were added 
together. The result could not have spoken more eloquently. Of 
all the votes for Caldera, 35 percent were "orange" and nine 
percent represented the other groups and parties in the 
alliance. Without that 44 percent of the total, Caldera could 
not have become president. The veteran leader made no mistake, 
then, when, despite the efforts made to ridicule his 
undertaking, he tried to avoid excluding anyone, however 
unimportant he might be. 
  The MAS participated in this alliance without imposing any 
type of bureaucratic conditions, so traditional in the rigid 
structure of Venezuelan politics. We drafted a strategy and we 
implemented it. The important thing was to triumph over 
bipartisanship, to release the country from the paralyzing AD 
[Democratic Action]-COPEI straitjacket, to adapt the political 
structure, and to encourage the implementation of policies 
different from those that at the end of a 35-year period had 
plunged the country into its deepest crisis. The measure of our 
success was Caldera's victory, and not the size of a certain 
bureaucratic quota to which we might have aspired on the basis 
of the political traditions imposed by the AD and the COPEI. In 
fact, the MAS does not have the slightest intention of involving 
itself in those ignoble bureaucratic tangles that have 
contributed so much to discrediting the Venezuelan political 
system. 
  However, that having been said, it is not hard to understand 
that the MAS presence in the government is necessary. It is 
required in order to face up to the tremendous demand for 
political change expressed by the combined votes of the Caldera 
alliance and La Causa R. The country voted against the AD and 
the COPEI. The country gave new protagonists a mandate. The 
country would lose confidence in a government that failed to 
express, in a realistic and cautious measure, the collective 
desire that other people assume leadership responsibilities. 
Fortunately, Caldera understands this perfectly, as was the case 
with the alliance to the creation of which he contributed in 
order to win. The futile effort to blackmail him with the 
presence of the MAS in the alliance, which, had it been 
successful, would have led to his defeat, will not sit well now 
either. Where the MAS is concerned, just as it knew how and was 
able to participate in the campaign without trying to steal the 
show, aware that in the final analysis, it was certainly a 
relatively weak faction, it will also know how and will be able 
to make its presence felt in the government without creating 
unnecessary vulnerabilities. As for the rest, God will provide.

<F P=106> [Article by Alonso Zambrano] </F>
  [Text] Maracaibo--It is clear to Angel Vera, the president 
of the Chamber of Deputies Defense Commission subcommission on 
frontiers, that in the frontier zone located on the right bank 
of the Machiques-Colon, in the state of Zulia, which includes 
the southern part of the lake, there is a perverse alliance of 
drug traffickers, Colombian guerrillas, and common criminals. 
  He has warned that this phenomenon has been on the increase 
recently as a result of two separate circumstances. They are the 
powerlessness of the Venezuelan government to deal with the lack 
of security on the one hand, and on the second, the indifference 
of the Colombian government. 
  In view of this situation, he believes not only that the 
Venezuelan Government is incapable of resolving this problem, 
but that there is also a need for the cooperation of the 
Colombian Government for the purpose of developing a 
coordinated plan for military and police intelligence strategy 
in these areas, along with a socio-economic program. This is 
because one of the reasons irregular forces have penetrated the 
zone and the peasant population living there, including the 
Yukpa and Bari Indians, is the inhospitable conditions to be 
found in that environment. This is true in the sectors of health 
care, roadways, and disease. The Venezuelan children there are 
even attending classes outdoors, under the trees. They are being 
instructed in the history of Colombia and are singing its 
national anthem. 
  "According to information we in the Defense Commission have 
obtained," Vera said, "there are 50,000 residents who have no 
country in this frontier area. They are the children of 
Venezuelans and undocumented Colombians who were born in a 
no-man's-land where they are recognized neither as Colombians 
nor Venezuelans. They have become a potential army that could in 
the short run plunge the peace and labor and productive 
tranquillity in this region into chaos. 
  "It is for this reason that the kidnappings that previously 
occurred on the ranches and deep in the mountain areas are now 
occurring only a few kilometers from urban centers. And the 
public can be sure that within a very short time, such 
kidnappings will be happening in the cities as well, with 
politicians, industrialists, bankers, and other leading 
personalities as their targets," he warned. 
  For these reasons, he believes that Venezuela should 
seriously review its process of integration with Colombia, 
because in connection with the binational agreements, and in the 
specific matter of the stolen cars, Colombia has in many cases 
failed to honor its commitment to return assets to the 
Venezuelan Government. 
  Vera warned that in the specific case of the kidnappings in 
this frontier area, there is one factor that is a cause of great 
concern. He painted the following picture for us. "In the course 
of the peace talks between the government and the Colombian 
guerrillas in Bogota, there was agreement on certain zones to be 
spared--areas in which the irregular forces and the authorities 
agreed that the army will not engage in action. 
  "One of these `neutral' zones," he said, "is on the right 
bank of the Machiques-Colon. And, naturally, as a result of 
these negotiations, the Colombian Government is not interested 
in reactivating its attacks on the guerrilla forces there." 
  According to Deputy Angel Vera, the interests of Bogota will 
be served, from the strategic and tactical points of view, if 
the problem in this frontier area continues, instead of having 
it prevail in the urban zones of its main cities. 
  In the opinion of this parliamentarian, integration with 
Colombia, seen from this realistic approach, has become a 
matter of the export of an instability problem to Venezuela.

  [Text] Central Reserve Bank [BCR] President Roberto 
Orellana Milla has said, "The main goal of the 1994 monetary and 
financial program is to achieve economic growth and to create 
job stability." 
  The goals established in the program for 1994 include 
reducing inflation to 8-10 percent, achieving a production 
increase (real GNP) of between 5 and 6 percent, increasing 
employment, increasing savings and investments, increasing 
exports, consolidating fiscal reforms, and increasing 
competitiveness among banks. 
  During a lecture to the members of the Salvadoran 
Association 
of Business Administration Professionals, Orellana Milla said 
social conditions were beginning to improve, per capita income 
was on the rise, family income and job opportunities had 
increased, and inflation was being reduced. 
  Orellana said: "Substantial progress has been achieved in 
the 
new economic system -- the social market economy. Thanks to 
this new system, the economy is growing steadily and a reduction 
in the fiscal deficit has been achieved." He also termed as 
successful the financial reforms of recent years, adding that 
the privatization of banks has engendered financial transactions 
that are much more effecient than in the past. Moreover, he 
said the stock market was rapidly growing and had great 
potential, adding that greater access to international credit 
has allowed businessmen a greater availability of funds for 
mid-term investments. 
  According to the BCR President, the outlook for 1994 is very 
encouraging, both for the financial system and the economy in 
general. Nevertheless, he said there are major mid-term 
challenges. He defined the challenges for the next five years as 
follows: Reducing extreme poverty, broadening and consolidating 
social policy, consolidating the social market economic system, 
continuing to encourage high and sustained growth with its 
corresponding creation of jobs, consolidating macroeconomic 
stability, eliminating the fiscal deficit, effectively 
integrating with the world economy, and reforming the state. 
  The BCR president concluded by saying, "The economy now 
presents many opportunities for businessmen seeking new markets 
and new business."

  [Text] Los Teques, Venezuela, 26 Jan (AFP) -- Journalists 
who were eyewitnesses report that today at about 2000 GMT (1600 
local time) the militarized National Guard seized control of the 
streets and avenues of this sleepy community located 20 km 
southwest of Caracas. 
  Los Teques became the stage of violent student 
demonstrations 
during the funeral of a high school student killed last night by 
a teargas grenade. According to related reports, demonstrators 
hurled rocks at regional and municipal government installations 
(of Miranda State, which extends to the east and southwest of 
Caracas). Demonstrators also set two vehicles on fire. 
  Jessica Diaz, a 16-year-old high school student, died last 
night during a student protest, when she was struck in the head 
by a teargas grenade. In the morning, tense calm was reported 
in Los Teques as a vigil for Diaz concluded amid expressions of 
sorrow by her classmates, who gathered under strong police 
surveillance. Under the watchful eyes of the militarized 
National Guard, violence erupted when the funeral procession 
began marching toward the local cemetery to bury Diaz. 
  [Paris AFP in Spanish at 2119 GMT on 26 January transmits a 
related 150-word, Puerto La Cruz-datelined report that adds: 
"Witnesses today said that student demonstrations, which have 
been shaking Venezuela for two weeks so far, have again spread 
to the tourist city of Puerto La Cruz, where a truck driver was 
injured and 11 students were arrested."]

  [Text] Guatemala City, Jan 26 (AFP) -- About 1,500 Indian 
peasants from the southern coast of Guatemala protested today 
outside the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala City. They are asking that 
their debt with International Development Agency [AID] be 
forgiven. 
  The peasants were received at the embassy by U.S. adviser 
Marilyn McAffe, who refused to speak with the press. The 
demonstration blocked part of La Reforma Avenue, one of the most 
important highways in the southern part of the city, causing an 
enormous traffic jam. 
  The leaders of the movement explained that AID granted an 
$11 
million loan to the Penny Foundation, which in turn purchased 
land to sell to the peasants under very flexible payment terms. 
The drop in coffee prices and other agricultural products, 
however, has forced the peasants to fall behind in payments. 
That is why they are asking AID to forgive the debt. The farmers 
said they would continue to picket until their demands are met.

  Appeal from the URNG: 
  Given the crisis in Guatemala, as evidenced by former 
President Jorge Serrano Elias' coup, the roles of the 
Legislative, Executive, and Judicial Branches have been totally 
discredited. 
  Guatemalan society rejects corruption, deceit, schemes, and 
fraud, and it refuses to continue to live with the impunity with 
which those state organizations act. 
  The 30 January referendum plans to legitimize the despicable 
political and moral conduct that has prevailed in the state 
branches for years. 
  The announced constitutional reforms are not the ones 
Guatemala needs and demands; they are schemes hatched behind 
civilian society's back that deliberately intend to worsen the 
national crisis. 
  The causes that led to the May 1993 coup d'etat remain 
unsolved. In-depth reforms, based on a different project for the 
construction of a new nation, are necessary to solve the 
institutional crisis.

  [Text] Solidarity Party [PS] President Samuel Lewis has 
announced his political organization will face the election 
process alone without alliances to save the party's honor and 
ethical principles. Taking advantage of a news conference held 
yesterday at PS headquarters, Lewis read a communique explaining 
the official PS position on the 8 May presidential elections. 
  The PS unsuccessfully tried to forge electoral alliances 
with 
the Nationalist Liberal Republican Alliance [Molirena], the 
Christian Democratic Party [PDC], and the Arnulfista Party, 
which already have their three-member presidential tickets. 
Lewis said the party's conciliatory efforts to reach agreements 
that would serve as a basis for unity and constructive work have 
been fruitless. According to the Electoral Tribunal, 8 February 
is the deadline for the political parties to officially announce 
their candidates. 
  The PS president said that with rare exceptions, resentment, 
personality conflicts, and the repulsive practice of seeking and 
proposing alliances to obtain political privileges still prevail 
in the political parties. 
  The PS announced its proposal "to run independently in the 
upcoming elections and to appeal to the people and uncommitted 
political parties to form a grand dignity front to secure an 
elections victory" to its political organizations. 
  The PS president has not discarded the possibility of an 
alliance with the National Unity Mission, which is also planning 
to run alone in the upcoming elections. 
  Solidarity will hold its party convention on 30 January and 
conventioneers are expected to ratify the presidential ticket 
proposed by the party's political committee, composed of Lewis, 
who heads it; Carlos Clement, first vice president; and Marisin 
Villalaz, second vice president.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 26 Jan (NA) -- Foreign Ministry 
Secretary General Andres Cisneros said that "having the 
justification is not enough" when he referred to the Malvinas 
Islands, and he explained that the current policy on this matter 
is centered on negotiations with Great Britain. 
  Thus, Cisneros answered a series of criticisms by expert 
Federico Ruiz Guinazu, who maintained that "the Foreign Ministry 
is mistaken regarding the Malvinas" because it does not center 
its demands on the basis of "sound rights that must be 
reiterated repeatedly." 
  Cisneros stresses: "Isolation alienated the country from the 
world's centers of power, it caused a confrontation with the 
United States at an immense cost, and it systematically 
alienated it from the rest of Latin America; although the 
country tried to establish a minimum of ties with the 
continent's countries, in the end we ended up clearly being the 
unpopular party." 
  He defended the current policy when he indicated that Brazil 
and Chile had never been "potential partners because they had 
always been two of our hypothetical military opponents." 
  The Malvinas was the third hypothesis, "which ended up with 
the country embarking on a war with the country that is the 
owner of the world's third-largest navy, an ally of the planet's 
most powerful nation, a policy-making partner in NATO [acronym 
given in English], and a permanent member of the UN Security 
Council." 
  The official highlighted the fact that currently trade with 
Chile has tripled in view of reciprocal investment amounting to 
several million dollars, and that Brazil "is the main purchaser, 
the second- largest supplier, and it is a partner in a common 
market [Common Market of the South], together with two other 
members, that will change the region's history." 
  Regarding the Malvinas, Cisneros maintains that in this 
matter "a community of interests and the joint exploitation of 
resources that will, in time, provide the basis of coexistence 
that one day will help in agreeing to a non-traumatic transfer 
of sovereignty" is currently being sought. 
  "The negotiating alternative evolves, not from the 
replacement of the law, but as a second stage that is logically 
the continuation of the basically legitimate alternative, which 
for 50 years has demonstrated that it is capable of obtaining 
the justification for us, but not the islands." Cisneros said in

  [Excerpts] La Paz, 26 Jan (EFE) -- The newspaper LA RAZON 
reported today that alleged Bolivian drug "kingpin" Isaac 
Chavarria was arrested by the Special Antinarcotics Force 
(FELCN) during a vast operation that included the arrests of 
another 43 "important" drug traffickers. 
  According to LA RAZON, Chavarria's arrest was announced by a 
"source close to the U.S. Embassy in La Paz." 
  The Interior Ministry announced that it will summon a news 
conference within the next few hours to provide details about 
the antidrug operation that led to Chavarria's arrest. 
  The Santa Cruz police department has reported that 18 
persons 
have been arrested over the last few hours in antidrug 
operations conducted in Cochabamba and Santa Cruz Departments. 
  During these operations the police confiscated several of 
Chavarria's properties in Okinawa, a town settled by Japanese 
immigrants located 40 km from Cochabamba. 
  Chavarria, a private pilot who is around 45 years old, was 
involved in the "narcopictures" and "narcovideos" political 
scandal that occurred at the end of the 1980's, which compelled 
political parties to achieve agreements and bury investigations 
on the alleged connections between political leaders and drug 
traffickers. [passage omitted] 
  According to U.S. Embassy sources in La Paz cited by LA 
RAZON, Chavarria became one of the largest drug traffickers 
after Carmelo "Meco" Dominguez was arrested, and is presumably 
one of the main suppliers of cocaine to the Colombian cartels.

<F P=106> [Report by Francisco Roque Bacarreza] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 26 Jan (EFE) -- The Latin American and 
Caribbean diplomatic communities in Washington today were 
somewhat disappointed by U.S. President Bill Clinton's speech 
because he dedicated only three lines to them. 
  "We have summoned a summit of continental leaders from 
Canada 
to South America. And we will continue to exert pressure to 
restore democracy in Haiti," Clinton plainly said in his State 
of the Union address on the evening of 25 January before 
Congress. 
  Nevertheless, as certain Chilean and Mexican diplomats 
noted, 
Clinton's constant references to efforts already made to 
liberalize international trade also pertain to Latin American 
nations. An Andean diplomat said, "If we fail to do our homework 
-- adjust and modernize structures -- it will be very difficult 
to heighten the interest of the United States and its 
corporations." His opinion was shared by a Brazilian diplomat 
and a third person from Central America, who discussed Clinton's 
message in private. 
  Meanwhile, Isaac Cohen, director of the Economic Commission 
for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLA), told EFE: "It is up 
to us, the Latin Americans, to turn those three lines into a 
large door." 
  Cohen described the meeting confirmed by Clinton as a "very 
important" opportunity for the heads of state of the entire 
continent and the Caribbean. 
  The effort, to which Cohen and the diplomats who were 
consulted referred, pertains to negotiations between Latin 
American and Caribbean nations and the United States on the 
basis of the results and progress made in structural adjustment 
and modernization plans to achieve an adequate level of 
competitiveness abroad. 
  Several of the presidents who visited President Clinton in 
the past year, such as Argentina's Carlos Menem, and the heads 
of state of Central America and the Caribbean pointed out the 
need to change the terms of relations with the United States. In 
this regard, they agreed on the need to expand trade 
opportunities in the U.S. market, to offer facilities for the 
investment of capital, and to support technological cooperation. 
  According to certain State Department diplomats, the 
hemispheric summit, whose date and site have not yet been 
determined, could take place during the second half of 1994. 
Diplomatic sources predict the meeting will take place in Miami 
(Florida) prior to the election of certain governors and the 
partial renewal of the U.S. Congress in November. The heads of 
state of the nations of the inter-American system have not met 
since 1967. The last "summit" was held at the Punta del Este 
(Uruguay) beach resort. 
  Diplomats consulted by EFE, who were somewhat disappointed, 
said they were not surprised by the content of Clinton's speech, 
which focused on domestic matters and left foreign policy on a 
secondary level. The hemispheric "summit" could focus on trade, 
democracy, poverty, and social politics, according to sources 
close to the initial preparations. In a message read on 25 
January before a solemn session of Congress, Clinton made 
constant references to U.S. interest in expanding free trade 
borders to improve the people's living standards. The drug 
trafficking issue was not singled out, but Clinton included it 
in a new battle front opened by his government to combat a wave 
of violence, which is among the major concerns of this country.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Thai Foreign Affairs Minister Prasong 
Sunsiri has told this newspaper that Brazil is the Latin 
American country with the greatest potential for receiving Thai 
investment. During a working meeting with his Brazilian 
counterpart Celso Amorim at the Foreign Ministry yesterday, 
Sunsiri decided to postpone the opening of a Thai commercial 
bureau in Brazil. The minister decided rather to begin by 
seeking to promote commercial and economic ties with Brazil, and 
by sponsoring a seminar in 1994 for entrepreneurs to exchange 
views and become acquainted with the economic situations in the 
two countries. 
  For Sunsiri the main problem is distance, for which reason 
Brazil "does not import products like jewels, electronics, and 
textiles" from his country. In 1992 the bilateral exchange 
stood at $367 million, of which $13.3 million are accounted for 
by Thai exports. Brazilian sales on the Thai market amounted to 
$353.7 million. 
  The Thai minister added that the two countries do not have 
the same economic potential. In the technological field, he 
said, Brazil is ahead in some areas, while Thailand is ahead in 
others. "We must use this in joint investments, `joint 
ventures,' and in cooperation with other markets," he said. 
"Within the foreseeable future I see the economies of Europe 
and the United States going through a period of recession, while 
the economies of Asian and Pacific countries will grow." 
Sunsiri said that in the 21st century Brazil will have to look 
toward the Pacific in a different manner, as an alternative to 
dependence on European and U.S. markets. 
  The minister is accompanied by three entrepreneurs: Kanchana 
Thaichon, of Thailand's Chamber of Commerce; Prasert 
Poongkumarn, senior vice president of C.P. Trading Company, and 
Suphat Wibulseth, of the same enterprise. The C.P. Trading 
Company is Thailand's biggest group, with investment in various 
sectors such as farm industries and telecommunications. The 
entrepreneurs will afterwards visit Santiago de Chile and Buenos 
Aires. 
  The objective of the tour of Chile and Argentina is to sound 
out opportunities for investment. Chile, the minister said, 
will become a full APEC -- Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation -- 
member in 1995. 
  Brazilian imports from Thailand include natural rubber 
products, motorcycle accessories, cameras, watches, and 
teleprinters.

  [Text] The Health Ministry and the PRC Pharmaceutical State 
Administration yesterday signed a protocol of intention with a 
view to promoting technical exchange in the pharmaceutical area. 
The Brazil news agency has reported that the document provides 
for, among other things, exchange of information in the areas of 
of raw material purchasing, final products, and the provision of 
technology. 
  Health Minister Henrique Santillo said that the government 
has great expectations over the expansion of bilateral 
cooperation with the PRC. The protocol provides for training 
and consultation services by professionals of the two countries, 
and for the possibility of creating joint medical and 
pharmaceutical facilities in Brazil and in the PRC. 
  The PRC mission, which is headed by PRC Pharmaceutical State 
Administration Director Huang Jive -- who signed the protocol on 
behalf of his country -- will stay in Brazil until tomorrow. A 
Brazilian mission made up of state laboratory directors and 
technicians from the National Health Control Secretariat will 
visit the PRC in April to observe the facilities of the PRC 
state company and to discuss the strengthening of the protocol 
terms.

<F P=106> [Article by Nilton Horita] </F>
  [Text] A new and thrilling Brazilian adventure is under 
way. Following the vogue for stock exchanges and Eurobonds, the 
purchase of companies and real estate has become the fashion 
among foreign investors. Citibank, for example, is investing $1 
billion in the privatization of Brazilian state-owned 
enterprises and in launching a $100-million fund to purchase 
shares in Brazilian companies. 
  The Chemical Bank has followed suit. It is analyzing 
Brazilian companies with growth potential. Funds like these are 
also open to Brazilians, but their financial resources must be 
huge -- anybody with $5 million at his disposal may consider 
himself a candidate. 
  This is the reason why investors are companies and 
capitalists at the top of the tree in the financial world. 
Garantia, one of the forerunners of this new market in Brazil, 
is successfully managing an investment fund that has already 
invested $30 million. 
  The purchase of Artex by Garantia was, in fact, that sort of 
business deal. The new owners of Artex are the shareholders -- 
both Brazilians and foreigners -- in Garantia Partners (GP) -- a 
fund especially established for this business transaction. 
  Claudio Haddad, a Garantia manager, stated that this market 
deals with companies that do not negotiate shares on the stock 
exchange and that have some special characteristics. "We also 
have a special fund for medium-sized companies," he said. 
  Pactual and Icatu Bank have also followed suit. The largest 
fund is that of Icatu, with assets totalling $100 million. The 
much-publicized DM-9 advertising agency only exists because of 
investments by Icatu. Once Nizan Guanaes became a successful, 
international advertising man, Icatu sold its shares in DM-9 to 
the owners of the company. 
  This market looks as if it will be the fashion in the 
financial world this year. JP Morgan recently bought 15 percent 
of Latasa stocks and 10 percent of Mappin stocks. This is a 
strategy followed by JP Morgan worldwide -- it buys shares in 
companies with good possibilities and then sell them at a profit. 
  As Citibank Vice President Jose Monforte explains: "We are 
beginning a new round [preceding word in English] of company 
ownership changes. The generalized feeling is that the country 
will achieve stability, because of time considerations, and 
resume growth. This situation creates a good opportunity to 
make money." 
  If everything turns out all right, the value of assets will 
increase. Monforte believes many companies will be unable to 
keep up with the new stage of growth due to the lack of capital. 
  "Once they become aware of that, they will inevitably have 
to 
start selling," he says, adding that "every foreign investor 
with whom I talk remarks on this trend." 
  Icatu Bank President Daniel Dantas explains that investment 
funds may also participate in new endeavors that spring from 
brilliant ideas -- like what happened in the United States with 
Apple, one of the great successes in computer science that 
started in a garage. 
  Dantas notes: "We invested, for example, in Nilton Molina, a 
former insurance broker. It is a pleasure to see how successful 
he is. If any businessman, regardless of the size of his 
business, wishes to talk to us, he need only look for us. Money 
is no problem." 
  This aggressiveness in the Brazilian market has led the 
Chemical Bank to bring specialists to Brazil. "Capital flows 
wherever there are good business opportunities," says Chemical 
Bank Investment Director Wayne Perkins, adding that "we must 
enter now, otherwise our competitors will outstrip us."

  [Text] Brasilia -- Deputy Luiz Henrique, president of the 
PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], has started a debate 
on an alternative presidential candidacy to that of PT [Workers 
Party] leader Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. He has already talked 
with Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso (PSDB) 
[Brazilian Social Democracy Party], and has arranged meetings 
with Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho (PMDB), Rio de 
Janeiro Governor Leonel Brizola (PDT) [Democratic Labor Party], 
and former Sao Paulo Governor Orestes Quercia (PMDB). Luiz 
Henrique is formulating a proposal for an alliance of the PMDB, 
PSDB, PDT, and PTB for the successor to Itamar Franco, based on 
suggestions made by the presidents of regional party branches 
and by government leader Pedro Simon. 
  "We must find a name with popularity on the streets," Luiz 
Henrique said. 
  MDB Deputy for Rio Grande do Sul Antonio Britto, who will 
run 
for governor in his state, said he is striving for the alliance, 
because he believes that "the alliance will have to be made, 
either today as a gesture of greatness, or tomorrow from 
necessity." 
  "May God permit that the alliance be made through 
greatness." 
  Recife Mayor Jarbas Vasconcellos (PMDB) said that for 15 
days 
Simon has debated his proposal with the main PMDB leaders. 
Vasconcelos, who according to Simon is one of those who should 
participate in the debates, said he has already adopted a 
position on the subject: The candidate must enjoy popularity on 
the streets, and in this regard PSDB Senator Mario Covas is 
currently a good option, despite the fact that he has declared 
himself a candidate for the governorship of Sao Paulo. 
  Despite his continuing work for an alternative candidacy to 
that of Lula, PMDB Senator for Rio Grande do Sul Pedro Simon, 
the government leader in the Senate, yesterday said at Planalto 
Palace that a ticket made up of the president of the PT and of 
PSDB President Tasso Jereissati would be the favorite for the 
election. 
  Simon said: "I am not against the PT, and I believe Tasso as 
Lula's vice president would make a good ticket." 
  Simon advocated the Lula-Tasso ticket while denying that he 
has proposed the creation of an alliance between the PMDB, PSDB, 
PDT, and PTB. According to Simon, the only objective of his 
proposal for the formation of a coalition of social democratic 
parties is to prevent "the appearance of a new Collor."

<F P=106> [Article by Vera Saavedra Durao: "Number of Unemployed in </F>
Country Drops"] 
  [Text] Rio de Janeiro--The rate of open unemployment in the 
country's six metropolitan areas (Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, 
Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Recife, and Porto Alegre) in November 
was 4.57 percent, down from 4.89 percent in October and 5.82 
percent in November 1992, it was reported yesterday by the 
Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). 
  Of the six metropolitan areas surveyed by the institute, 
Recife was the only one showing an increase: unemployment there 
was 8.28 percent in November, compared to 7.93 percent in 
October, and 8.77 percent in November 1992. Unemployment dropped 
in the other areas: to 5.30 percent in Salvador (5.42 percent in 
October), 3.40 percent in Belo Horizonte (3.84 percent in 
October), 3.56 percent in Rio de Janeiro (3.90 percent in 
October), 5.08 percent in Sao Paulo (5.45 percent in October), 
and 2.82 percent in Porto Alegre (3.56 percent in October). 
  That almost general trend toward a lower rate of open 
unemployment in the six metropolitan areas was accompanied by a 
rise in the average rate of activity in those regions--to 61.09 
percent, compared to 60.29 percent in October--meaning that more 
jobs were available. 
  All sectors of economic activity experienced less 
unemployment in November, examples being the processing industry 
(5.97 percent compared to 6.11 percent), construction (5.25 
percent compared to 5.86 percent), commerce (4.61 percent 
compared to 5.10 percent), and services (3.51 percent compared 
to 3.64 percent). 
  The IBGE also announced an increase in the employed 
population in the six metropolitan areas (15,474,639, compared 
to 15,428,279 in October), meaning that 46,360 people entered 
the labor market. 
  Despite that, the number of employees with work cards fell 
by 
2 percent in the labor market, while the number of "cardless" 
workers grew by 5 percent, thus confirming the growth of the 
informal labor market. 
<H5>  Average Real Incomes </H5>
  The average real income of employed individuals last October 
was up 14 percent over October 1992. The outstanding increases 
were in commerce (average real wages up 22 percent), the 
processing industry (16 percent), and services (14 percent). 
Self-employed workers experienced the largest increase in real 
income in October 1993: up 27 percent over the same month in 
1992.

<F P=106> [Article by Fatima Belchior: "Petrobras Forecasts 7.5 </F>
Percent Rise in Brazilian Production This Year"] 
  [Text] Rio de Janeiro--After producing an average of 
669,000 barrels per day throughout 1993, the oil fields 
scattered around the country are expected to increase their 
output by 7.5 percent in 1994: to 719,000 barrels per day. The 
jump in gas production will be even greater: from 20.2 million 
cubic meters per day to 24.6 million cubic meters per day--a 
rise of 22 percent. 
  It happens that 1993 was not one of the most promising years 
for investment in Petrobras, which was working with a limited 
budget. Investments by the end of the year totaled about $2 
billion, of which something like $980 million was spent to 
develop the production of petroleum and natural gas. 
  But results were better than the company expected, according 
to the assistant superintendent of the Production Department, 
Bergson Antonio Cajueiro. The company extracted 669,000 barrels 
per day, or 6,000 barrels per day more than had been expected 
initially. 
  By the end of the year, the country had produced about 2 
million barrels more than expected, with the result that it did 
not have to import the equivalent of $32 million worth. Compared 
to 1992, petroleum production was up 2.4 percent, and gas 
production was up 6 percent. 
  That performance was due in particular to the fact that the 
Bijupira-Salema (Campos Basin) and Caravela (Santos Basin) 
fields produced more than expected in Petrobras' initial 
calculations. There was also increased operational productivity, 
according to Cajueiro. 
  The stars in petroleum production in 1993 were the Campos 
Basin off the Rio de Janeiro coast and the Santos Basin, which 
extends from Cabo Frio in Rio de Janeiro to Santa Catarina. They 
played an important part in the increase in production and in 
reserves, which, according to preliminary Petrobras 
calculations, ended the year at 4 billion barrels, or 8.1 
percent more than the total of 3.7 billion barrels in 1992. 
  All indications are that the Campos and Santos Basins will 
continue to perform outstandingly in 1994, when Petrobras plans 
to invest $1.1 billion to develop our country's petroleum and 
natural gas production. The amount scheduled for all Petrobras 
deals is $3.4 billion, according to Orlando Galvao, the 
company's financial director. Two-thirds of that will be spent 
on petroleum exploration and production. 
<H5>  Challenge </H5>
  Increasing petroleum production from 669,000 barrels per day 
to 719,000 is being considered a challenge at Petrobras. After 
all, as Cajueiro explained, that will come to 50,000 more 
barrels per day, a quite significant amount. Moreover, there 
will be the natural decline in production by producing wells. If 
nothing is spent to expand production, production will fall from 
669,000 barrels per day to 629,000 barrels per day--a drop of 
40,000 barrels per day. So in fact, according to Cajueiro's 
calculations, Petrobras will have to produce an additional 
90,000 barrels per day to achieve 719,000 barrels per day 
(40,000 to make up for the natural decline in production plus 
the additional 50,000). By the end of the year, assuming an 
average price of $16 per barrel (based on 1993 prices through 
November), the state firm will have saved $520 million that it 
otherwise would have had to spend on petroleum imports. The 
major contributors to increased production will be the giant 
Marlim and Albacora fields (in the Campos Basin), Caravela 
(Santos Basin), and Urucu (Amazon Basin). 
  If petroleum production of 719,000 barrels per day (on 
average) is confirmed by the end of 1994 and if consumption is 
on the order of 1.3 billion barrels per day (a conservative 
estimate), our country's oil fields will be supplying 55 percent 
of our domestic requirements, while the remaining 45 percent 
will have to be imported.

  [Text] Mexico, 25 Jan (AFP) -- The Simon Bolivar National 
Guerrilla Coordinating Board [CNG] issued a communique on 25 
January in Mexico City denying any responsibility for the 
killings in Uraba, northeast Colombia, and blaming the 
"(regular) Army and its offspring, the paramilitary." 
  The guerrillas accused the Colombian Government of 
"irresponsibly and deceitfully" blaming the Revolutionary Armed 
Forces of Colombia, a member of the CNG, for the 35 deaths on 23 
January. 
  In a text entitled "Infamy or Cynicism?", the CNG said this 
is not the first time there has been killing in that area, 
"which has become the center of a dirty war and state-sponsored 
terrorism." 
  The CNG adds: "It has been proven that violence is being 
promoted by the Army and paramilitary groups working for Fidel 
Castano, a drug trafficker who donates land for military bases 
and the founder of the deadly `Persecuted by Pablo Escobar.'" 
  The guerrillas noted that the Colombian Government's 
expressed goal is "to isolate the guerrillas politically through 
lies and slander and by blaming them for actions linked to the 
dirty war." 
  The CNG concluded: "We know the people of Uraba will 
overcome this night of terror caused by the government through 
the Army and its offspring, the paramilitary. The people will 
punish the culprits for the blood shed by their children."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Polls"] </F>
  [Text] The polls have turned into a source of confusion 
rather than clarity, particularly during the pre-election 
period. We believe that when well-conducted, they are a 
good--and necessary--tool for measuring public opinion trends 
and preferences with respect to a given candidate, product, 
issue, or current event. However, what has been happening with 
the latest surveys of voting intentions in terms of presidential 
candidates could undermine the indispensable credibility that 
pollsters must have in order to perform their task with all due 
responsibility. 
  Last week, we Colombians learned of two opinion polls 
concerning the presidential race, polls conducted by the same 
firm (although one of them had been subcontracted) that yielded 
very different results. In the poll ordered by precandidate 
Andres Pastrana, Pastrana led, while the other one, contracted 
by this daily newspaper, showed Ernesto Samper in the lead. A 
few days later, the polling experts said that while the results 
were apparently contradictory, they actually reflected similar 
trends and that, with respect to most of the figures obtained, 
the disparity could be explained by the margin of error. 
Whatever the case, the campaigns of presidential candidates very 
frequently include polls in which the person ordering them 
generally fares very well. Inversely, when such polls are not 
favorable to them, there is an attempt to conceal them, an 
attitude that could be considered legitimate from a propaganda 
viewpoint, but one that is not very honest to a public assaulted 
and confused by this war of disinformation. 
  It is important to dispel any doubt about what some of our 
fellow citizens generally think of the polls: that they are 
manipulated in favor of those ordering them. That is why we 
applaud the decision of the National Election Council (CNE) to 
require the various polling companies, domestic or foreign, to 
register with it and abide by certain minimum rules before the 
media may divulge their work on the political preferences of 
potential voters. The CNE also prohibits the publication of 
polls conducted directly by the media without complying with 
such requirements as total disclosure of the poll, the sources 
of funding, type and scope of sampling, estimated margin of 
error, and other factors. 
  We are sure that the CNE's decision to intervene in these 
matters results from the necessary transparency that polls and 
surveys must have, particularly when they concern such delicate 
issues as stating which presidential candidate has the greatest 
chance of winning that office. We hope that the technical 
commission that is to be appointed to oversee compliance with 
the provisions contained in the CNE's resolution will not become 
a shelter from the citizens' right to be well-informed and that 
it will begin, as we once tried to do, to filter the 
questionnaires and content of the polls. 
  As we approach the final stretch of the presidential 
campaign, it is important to set clear rules of play that must 
be followed by the different polling firms in order to prevent 
public opinion from being disoriented by the election 
preferences of the Colombian people. Polls are unquestionably 
beginning to be a fundamental part of our political culture, but 
we must take great care to prevent them--rather than ideas and 
proposals--from becoming the center of the debate that will 
occur this year. It is a debate that will enable us to select 
the man best prepared to govern our country's destiny rather 
than simply the man found to be most attractive, as if it were 
merely a beauty contest rather than an election for the highest 
office in the land.

  [Text] It will not be easy for the industrial sector to 
adjust to the integration program of the Group of Three (G-3), 
and it has just five years to change its production structure so 
that it can compete with the Mexicans. 
  This was stated by the president of the National Association 
of Industrialists (ANDI), Carlos Arturo Angel Arango, in a 
message to the members of the association. 
  According to Angel Arango, it was not easy to get good 
results in negotiations in which the trade commitments had been 
defined beforehand and the political circumstances, with the 
imminent change of government in Venezuela, required immediate 
decisions. 
  The leader of the business association said that in view of 
these circumstances, an overall evaluation leads to the 
conclusion that the negotiations were handled well by the 
Foreign Trade Ministry. 
  In his view, the Colombian industrial sector "will not find 
it easy" to adjust to the new system. He explained that the 
country-of-origin standards will be more stringent for Colombian 
companies and for other sectors because their production 
conditions are less favorable than those of Mexico, and the new 
developments will provide little or no protection from that 
country's goods. 
  "Nevertheless," added Angel, "we are not interested in 
discussing the mechanisms contained in the agreement right now; 
the ANDI will do that later, and the necessary analyses are 
being prepared for that purpose." 
  Angel indicated that the trade agreement with Mexico goes 
much further than this type of pact usually does. The commitment 
will be a key factor in the country's future tariff situation, 
making the economic liberalization irreversible and its 
expansion inevitable. 
  The president of the ANDI reiterated that the Colombian 
industrial sector is preparing to compete with an economy like 
Mexico's, which, in turn, must face the challenge of competing 
on an equal footing with the United States. 
<H5>  The Agreement </H5>
  Angel suggested that we join the Free Trade Agreement 
quickly; otherwise, we will be at a disadvantage in competing 
with Mexico, especially with regard to raw materials and capital 
goods, "since our partner will have the benefit of having the 
United States as a supplier in the next few years." 
  As the agreement stands now, Colombia may export 62 percent 
of its industrial goods tariff-free, while Mexico may sell only 
16 percent of its goods tariff-free. 
  Mexico, on the other hand, will have to wait five years 
before the products that were on the semi-slow list can enter 
the Colombian market free of tariff. 
  Other sectors' goods will see annual tariff decreases of 10 
percent for the next 10 years. 
  The tariff protection of vehicles will be dismantled in two 
years. In addition, the agreement calls for the creation of an 
automotive committee that is to establish a barter program 
within two years. This instrument obliges Mexico to import from 
Colombia a greater value of vehicles than it exports. 
  In agriculture, it was decided to exclude from the 
liberalization program farm products that are subject to price 
bands or receive some type of subsidy in Mexico. 
  The pact brings the Colombian economy into an expanded 
market 
with 145 million consumers, in a region producing $373 billion 
worth of goods and services (gross domestic product).

  [Text] Imports are coming into the country at a slower 
rate, but foreign buying is still at a high level. 
  Between January and August, imports totaled $6.435 billion, 
an increase of 55.7 percent over the same period of the previous 
year. 
  According to the director of the National Administrative 
Department of Statistics (DANE), Rodolfo Uribe, this growth rate 
means that external purchases are stabilizing, especially 
considering that in the first half of the year, the increase was 
77.9 percent. 
  In the first eight months of the year, Colombia's exports 
totaled $4.662 billion, 2.5 percent higher than the figure for 
the same period in 1992. 
  This means that imports were $1.773 billion higher than 
exports, resulting in a deficit in the balance of trade. 
  Last year, the shortfall was just $414 million. In other 
words, in a year, the trade deficit (spending on imports 
exceeding earnings from exports) quadrupled. 
  The trade gap can be explained by the increase in domestic 
demand for foreign goods, the recession in developed countries, 
the decline in international prices for Colombia's main exports, 
and the coffee crisis. 
  If the government's predictions hold true, by the end of 
1993 
the trade deficit should fall to $1.297 billion. 
  In other words, the country will have to curb the rate of 
imports even further and add more dynamism to exports. 
  The government expects external sales to rise by 5.6 percent 
by the end of the year, while imports are slated to grow by 
"only" 48.5 percent. 
<H5>  By Sector </H5>
  When imports are broken down by sector, it can be seen that 
the greatest increase is in capital goods and construction 
materials. 
  Foreign purchases in this sector totaled $2.508 billion, a 
jump of 91.20 percent over the figure for the first eight months 
of 1992. 
  The greatest dynamism can be seen in construction materials, 
with a growth of 110 percent. Capital goods for industry rose 53 
percent, to a total of $1.452 billion. 
  Colombians bought foreign consumer goods amounting to $1.125 
billion, an increase of 70.69 percent over the previous period. 
  Colombia's main supplier continues to be the United States, 
whence 34 percent of its imports came during the period in 
question. 
  Purchases made in the United States were less dynamic, 
however, than those made in Japan and Venezuela, Colombia's two 
other major partners. 
  Whereas U.S. imports rose by 47.7 percent, imports from 
Japan 
and Venezuela doubled. 
  Customs revenues (from tariffs and the value-added tax) 
doubled as of August, climbing from 441.406 billion pesos to 
937.956 billion pesos. 
  The greater increase, 95 percent, was seen in value-added 
tax 
(IVA) collections. 
  The DANE explained that the import figures are subject to 
change as a result of corrections or revisions in payments made 
by the Directorate of National Taxes and Customs (DIAN).

<F P=106> [Commentary by Antonio Urdinola: "The Wealth of the </F>
Colombian Mafia"] 
  [Text] Nearly all the studies made regarding the drug 
traffic's economic impact on Colombia have been focused on the 
issue of the foreign currency entering the country through that 
activity, and its effects on monetary management and the balance 
of payments. Nevertheless, these criteria are insufficient for 
assessing the real dimensions of the business and, hence, its 
social and economic implications. 
  Last week, it was stated in this column that drug 
traffickers 
are currently accumulating assets in Colombia at an annual rate 
of approximately $2.5 billion. This figure was reached through a 
series of rather elementary considerations. In the first place, 
it is well known that most of the contraband entering the 
country is financed with Mafia dollars. It is paid for in pesos 
once the merchandise has been sold. The same device is used in 
the case of underbilling imports, especially consumer goods. 
  It has been estimated very conservatively that, for every 
$4.00 worth of legal imports, another dollar is now entering 
through contraband or underbilling, taking advantage of the 
indiscriminate commercial openness practiced by this 
administration. This means that, through such expedients, drug 
traffickers are accruing income in the country that could be 
estimated at $1.5 billion per year. 
  To be added to this are the dollars of illegal origin 
arriving as direct transfers from abroad, in banknotes from 
dealings such as fictitious tourism, or from overbilling of 
exports, which could amount to another $600 million annually. 
  Finally, we should remember that much of the acquisition of 
assets in the country is being done by drug traffickers through 
the purchase of properties paid for abroad. Through this device, 
large sums of illegal origin have been accumulated, and are in 
the hands of Colombian citizens completely dissociated from the 
drug business. 
  If we assume that the total value of the nation's material 
wealth (natural resources, including land, construction, and 
equipment) is four times the value of the GDP [gross domestic 
product], estimated at nearly $60 billion for 1993, we would 
find that, at the current rate, drug traffickers are acquiring 
one percent of that material wealth annually. Recalling that we 
have had 20 years of that business in Colombia, it does not seem 
absurd to think that the Mafia probably now owns 10 percent of 
the country's goods, as well as a similar volume abroad. The 
latter is disguised in a thousand different ways, through the 52 
notorious tax havens. 
  Fortunately for Colombia, that 10 percent of the national 
wealth is distributed among the 10 or 15 drug cartels, with 
their several thousand members. This causes the political power 
generated by that wealth to be established primarily on the 
regional level. 
  So long as drug consumption and trafficking continue to be 
illegal internationally, the Colombian drug traffickers will 
inevitably keep on accruing enormous earnings abroad. They will 
be brought into the country on a large scale if future 
governments do not change the extremely lax and indiscriminate 
commercial and exchange policies existing at present, and if tax 
amnesties as extensive as the previous ones continue to be 
enacted.

  [Text] Quito, 26 Jan (AFP) -- The Confederation of Indian 
Nationalities of Ecuador (Conaie) today asked for UN mediation 
to put an end to "the abuses committed against the brother 
peoples of Mexico." 
  In a letter sent to UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali, 
Conaie, which comprises the Indian communities of Ecuador, 
indicated that the uprising in Chiapas "is not an isolated 
incident but, rather, a social response to the prevailing 
conditions of poverty" extant in Latin America. Conaie said it 
is calling on the high-ranking international official to "in 
human terms" intervene in Mexico to help put an end to the 
abuses committed by against Indians in Ecuador. 
  The communique adds that it is the UN's "moral and political 
obligation" to guarantee the lives of the Indians in some way, 
because they are the "victims of the ferocious genocidal war 
waged by the Mexican Army." 
  It adds: "It cannot be possible that instead of providing 
human solutions to centuries of suffering, entire communities 
are being bombed." 
  The communique also says: "Measures such as declaring an 
amnesty or calling for a dialogue are insignificant in the 
solution of this dramatic situation if the economic interests of 
the dominant classes are not set aside." 
  According to Conaie, the events in Chiapas "are not promoted 
by a guerrilla group," but are "social reactions that should 
make all governments on the continent reflect about the need to 
review and change their neoliberal models."

  [Text] A PRC business delegation held a meeting with their 
Paraguayan colleagues at the Business Chamber of Commerce and 
Stock Exchange building during which they expressed their desire 
to increase bilateral trade with the objective of improving the 
well-being of Chinese and Paraguayans. 
  Nicolas Gonzalez Oddone, chiarman of the Paraguayan Business 
Chamber of Commerce and Stock Exchange, said: "This is the 
first time such a high-ranking delegation of PRC businessmen has 
visited Paraguay. We are very happy because the Business 
Chamber of Commerce and Stock Exchange seeks to establish ties 
between Paraguayan and foreign businessmen to promote trade. We 
have welcomed the Chinese delegation and organized a round of 
very encouraging negotiations. Many Paraguayan businessmen 
attended these negotiations, and contacts were made." 
  The Chinese businessmen showed interest in increasing 
commercial ties with Paraguay. In 1992, Paraguayan cotton 
exports to China totaled 25 million guaranies. 
  Gonzalez Oddeone said that China is a huge market with over 
1 
billion consumers, and that Paraguay can learn a lot from it. 
He explained that China is the country experiencing the 
greatest economic development among Pacific Rim countries, which 
have deregulated and opened their economies resulting in a 
massive inflow of capital. 
  He added: "This meeting is of fundamental importance because 
these are the first negotiations being held with the Chinese, 
who are from a country with which Paraguay has no diplomatic 
ties." 
  Moreover, Gonzalez said that Paraguay cannot ignore a market 
of over 1 billion inhabitants with a more advanced economic 
development. He added that Parguay will obtain great benefits 
from establishing economic ties with China. 
  The Chinese delegation was headed by the chairman of the 
Chinese Business Chamber of Commerce, seated in Beijing; and Xie 
Jianqun, current vice chairman of the China Council for the 
Promotion of International Trade. Xie Jianqun said said China 
is interested in both exporting and importing several products 
with the objective of improving the well-being of Paraguayan and 
Chinese consumers. He also noted the importance of the 
negotiations in stating that this is the first time all members 
of the council have visited Paraguay. 
  He added: "In the past we engaged in indirect bilateral 
trade transactions, and even some direct transactions on a small 
scale. We hope that by expanding our contacts with Paraguayan 
businessmen and through a better knowledge of each other 
bilateral trade will develop in the future."

  [Text] General Ramon Rosa Rodriguez, retired, the new 
executive secretary of the National Antinarcotics Secretariat 
(Senad), has said the resources available to the agency for 
repressing drug trafficking are "infinitely less" than the 
resources available to traffickers. Rodriguez said if he finds 
any military officer or influential person involved in the 
illegal trade he will arrest him or resign from his post. 
  "We have a limited amount of money available, while drug 
traffickers have large amounts. For this reason we have 
infinitely less resources than those available to traffickers. 
It is very difficult to be even in this respect," Rodriguez 
said. 
  Gen. Rodriguez was appointed to the post in a surprise move. 
His name was not mentioned as a candidate for the post and his 
designation was therefore a surprise. 
  Gen. Rodriguez told us that he was first in his class at the 
Military School promotion of 1955. He then entered the Military 
College. He went to Panama where he took infantry training 
courses at an U.S. instruction center. He then travelled to the 
United States to take general staff training courses. 
  He retired in December 1992 when he was 3d Corps general 
staff chief. He confirmed that he worked for the candidacy of 
the present head of state in the Colorado Party primaries and 
the presidential race. 
  As an example of the need to have the means to fight drug 
trafficking, Rodriguez said: "If I am the cook and someone wants 
to eat a steak, I have to get meat. If that person wants a 
steak and I only have rice and noodles, he will not get a steak 
from me." 
  What Rodriguez means is that in his short time as Senad 
secretary he was able to see the need for improvements knowing 
that the resources are limited. He talked about the lack of 
radar and interceptor planes to fight trafficking by air in the 
Chaco. 
  He indicated that trafficking by land in the Chaco is 
controlled by the military units in that zone, but even so more 
personnel are required. 
  Asked about the possibility that a high-ranking military man 
or an influential individual in the government try to get his 
complicity, Gen. Rodriguez said he will have two options. 
First, resort to the president to implement sanctions, and 
second resign. 
  "I am the boss" said Rodriguez, who pointed out that he will 
not allow another individual to run the institution at his will. 
He reiterated the support he received from the president. 
  Previous Senad administrators said they were seriously 
investigating money laundering in our country. Rodriguez said 
the work started by the previous team continues. He was not 
able, however, to give details of the investigation because he 
did not have the information. 
  He emphasized that for the time being he will not replace 
the 
men working with him. He indicated there may be changes in the 
future. 
  Regarding drug addiction in our country, Rodriguez said this 
problem is not yet that serious but it could get worse if 
corrective measures are not taken on time.

  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton has just identified the 
top goals of his administration and Congress for 1994: To reform 
the health care system and reclaim the streets from crime and 
drugs. In his first State of the Union address given on 25 
January before a joint session of Congress and televised 
nationwide, the President emphasized domestic issues. However, 
he stressed that the change in the former socialist bloc into a 
market economy is a guarantee for Washington. Clinton urged 
Congress to approve this year his health reform bill, 
threatening to veto any legislation that does not guarantee 
private health insurance for every American that can never be 
taken away. 
  Clinton praised the participation of U.S. troops in missions 
such as Somalia, although he made no reference to the military 
failure endured in that country. 
  President Clinton's address to the Congress made use of an 
over-confident language which with he praised his program to 
reduce the budget deficit and the approval of NAFTA. In 
reference to the nationwide problem of crime, he solidly 
supported legislation to put another 100,000 policemen in the 
streets, permanently jail criminals after their third felony, 
and ban assault weapons. Clinton also turned down reducing the 
U.S. military budget despite the fact that many people had asked 
him to reduce it in order to pay for other government programs. 
In his address Clinton did not give figures for military 
expenses next year, although he stressed that the current budget 
guarantees the capabilities of the Armed Forces.

  [Text] Politburo member Carlos Lage has called for the 
eradication of profiteers who are illegally filling their 
pockets in the black market. In a meeting with 102 presidents of 
the Havana People's Councils, Lage, also the secretary of the 
Council of Ministers, suggested that no more licenses be granted 
or that they be suspended for craftsmen whose products are made 
with raw materials of a dubious origin. 
  The participants in the meeting advocated the need to 
increase taxes on surplus profits and price regulations. 
Likewise, the presidents of the Havana People's Councils, 
stressed that domestic messengers ought to pay taxes since they 
are earning much more than what Interior Commerce established. 
Other issues discussed in the meeting were Havana's garbage 
removal system and the delivery of the winter campaign products 
to the people. 
  Pedro Chavez, president of the people's government in Havana 
and member of the Central Committee, was also present at the 
meeting.

  ["Straight Talk" program with host Juan Carlos Roque Garcia 
and guest Osvaldo Rodriguez of JUVENTUD REVELDE magazine -- live] 
  [Text] [Roque] The people's call to eradicate the wealthy 
[macetas] is today's subject. I believe we must first properly 
define why the people are asking for this, so that everyone can 
understand. Many people still do not understand the situation 
with the wealthy. 
  [Rodriguez] I believe it is offensive that there are those 
in 
our society who live well above the means of the people, in what 
amounts to sneering at the people, particularly humble workers. 
They do this contemptuously. They live off crime, have made it 
their lifestyle. They can therefore buy even the volition of 
weak people who are willing to sell out for money. 
  [Roque] Following your thought, we can define two types of 
wealthy people. There is a difference between the wealthy you 
have just mentioned and the other kind, no less wealthy -- 
pardon the redundancy -- who have earned their money through 
hard work. 
  [Rodriguez] Yes, I believe we must stress the difference. We 
recently spoke about this matter on this program. We asked 
ourselves if there were honest wealthy people, and became 
entangled in irrelevant issues. 
  It is important to explain this. We use the term maceta to 
define anyone who has a little money. We need to clarify that 
not everyone who has money has attained it dishonestly or 
illegally. There are people who may have inherited money from 
relatives. Some, through work, have attained certain levels of 
wealth, particularly as a result of certain policies -- some say 
erroneous economic policies. I truly believe that some people 
have taken advantage of specific situations. In this regard, I 
wish to mention the highly deserved money of farmers. Not all 
farmers engage in the black market. I believe this is quite 
clear. I know of farmers who plant tobacco, particularly in 
Pinar del Rio where the prices are much higher due to the 
quality of the leaf, and farmers in Havana who plant crops such 
as garlic. In both cases, I have seen that without needing to 
engage in the black market, they make a good profit selling 
their crops. This is deserved in view of their immense efforts. 
  [Roque] Now that we have clarified this, we are ready to 
discuss the people's call for eradicating the wealthy. I would 
like it to be clearly understood the type of wealth we are going 
to speak about. 
  [Rodriguez] I believe we need to reflect the calls from 
certain workers assemblies to confiscate the money of those who 
have attained it illegally, specifically referring to those 
people we mentioned. I believe that there are inequalities in 
today's society that we need to accept even though they are 
unfair. These inequalities are created by such factors as the 
fact that there are people entitled to receive help from 
relatives abroad. There are other inequalities created by the 
fact that certain people have access to hard currency income, 
such as tourism workers who receive tips in foreign currencies. 
This currency helps them, to a certain degree, satisfy some 
essential needs. 
  [Roque] There are other inequalities that have taken place 
for years, such as the case of these wealthy people. I believe 
this should be the focus of today's program. 
  [Rodriguez] At the beginning, I mentioned criminals 
specifically. I believe that the word wealthy is not the 
appropriate term. We are talking about criminals, those who have 
illegally amassed money and who today anger our workers, those 
of us who earn an honest living. There is a general call within 
these assemblies. Everyone is wondering: How? How are we going 
to confiscate the money of the wealthy? 
  [Roque] How do you determine who they are? 
  [Rodriguez] How are we going to determine whether someone's 
money was amassed legally or illegally? I have been thinking 
about these issues and have discussed them with numerous 
comrades. In every neighborhood, we know who is who. I believe 
the most trustworthy information on the activities of any 
citizen comes from his neighbors. As a matter of fact, we have 
the Unified Vigilance and Protection System [SUVP]. The 
Committees for the Defense of the Revolution are one of the most 
important components of the SUVP. They can contribute much of 
this information. We also have the recourse of police 
investigations. There is also the option of bringing that 
citizen to court to prove that his wealth was amassed illegally. 
  I believe that these are the plausible means of not only 
confiscating the money... [changes thought] We are also going to 
discuss how these people live today. We could confiscate money 
and goods, which would be the legal means of appropriating the 
highly arrogant lifestyles of these people. 
  [Roque] Undoubtedly, the implementation of this measure is 
extremely difficult. You just explained that it will not be easy 
to establish this differentiation. 
  [Rodriguez] There is also a margin of error. Errors might be 
made. There are people who might make it look like everything 
was amassed legally. Only an in-depth investigation might 
indicate otherwise. Inversely, there are those one might suspect 
of being involved in criminal activities, but who can prove that 
everything is legal. 
  [Roque] What we can be sure of is that the investigation 
will 
always be fair and that the margin of error will not produce 
injustice. Errors might occur, but they will be in terms of the 
impunity of some people. 
  [Rodriguez] Of course, at least for a while. I do not 
believe 
that impunity in this type of action can last long; at the 
beginning perhaps, in a first offensive. But this type of 
offensive needs to be permanent in nature. It cannot be like 
those campaigns in the past, when a large number of people were 
arrested, practically guilty, but since there was no evidence, 
many were freed, or were able to demonstrate where their money 
came from. I also think that... [changes thought] 
  Later on we will talk about goods. It is being said that 
since there are already rumors, and that since the people are 
demanding eradication of the wealthy, this social ballast is 
infecting certain neighborhoods. They have, of course, reacted; 
they know who they are. They know who the people are talking 
about. They are trying to find a escape. I wish to use this 
nationwide program to tell them that escape is going to be very 
difficult once the people's watchful eyes enter the picture. 
  [Roque] Many believe that since we are talking so openly on 
the radio, and the wealthy know that measures against them are 
going to be taken, this gives them a chance to seek solutions to 
their problem. However, you mentioned that the people are aware 
of all of this. Since the people are the ones calling for the 
eradication of the wealthy, are asking the authorities to please 
eliminate this social scum, the people need to support the 
authorities -- police and courts -- in order to eradicate them. 
We must have witnesses. In order to sentence someone in court, 
we need witnesses. 
  [Rodriguez] Undoubtedly, these people are preparing. The 
people are surely aware of this, and need to be on alert so they 
can provide the required information. It is obvious that these 
people will try to get rid of their Cuban money, probably in 
large amounts, by converting it into goods. It is known that 
many of them have done this on other occasions when they felt 
threatened by a change in the currency. Now, there is much talk 
about a change of currency. I do not know if this will happen or 
not. However, there is much talk about it. I am convinced that 
they have tried to mend their finances -- to put it in 
economists' technical terms. There are also those who have 
changed their Cuban currency into foreign currencies to protect 
themselves from a change. 
  [Roque] It is being said that foreign currency exchange 
rates 
have increased recently in the black market precisely because of 
this. 
  [Rodriguez] That is not all. I remember that it used to be 
said --- before the unions implemented the new system -- that in 
order to get a table in a restaurant you need to generously 
bribe the maitre'd. Who can afford a 200, 300, 400, 500-peso 
bribe to get a table but those who have made that money easily? 
No one who works for his money can afford to do this. These 
people corrupt anyone they come in contact with. They corrupt 
their families, and even their neighbors. 
  [Roque] We need to remain alert. 
  [Rodriguez] Yes. I believe we need to be very alert, need to 
keep our eyes wide open. The Cuban people should be on the 
lookout for this type of criminal who nowadays hurts us the 
most. I believe that all criminals hurt us. However, the wealthy 
do the most material and moral damage.

  [Text] Public Health Minister Julio Teja has reaffirmed in 
Havana that implementing a system of cost controls by illnesses 
and areas should be the goal of all hospitals in Cuba in 
addition to efforts to improve the quality of services. Pedro 
Ross, member of the Politburo and secretary general of the Cuban 
Workers Federation, also attended the workers' assembly at 
Enrique Cabrera Teaching Hospital where doctors, specialists, 
nurses, and paramedics analyzed significant problems of the 
sector and national economy. 
  Teja described the hospital as a national vanguard in the 
implementation of the cost control system by pathologies and 
areas which permits, for example, knowing how much it costs to 
treat a myocardial case or for surgery for specific illnesses. 
During the meeting, several hospital workers stressed the need 
to know and discuss the material costs incurred by the hospital 
and a medical sciences teacher asked the cost of training 
medical personnel, stressing that as long as this is not known 
our economic awareness will be lacking. 
  In the closing of the first health workers assembly in 
Havana, Pedro Ross stressed that this process of consultation 
with the people seeks to find intelligent and effective 
measures, not only in financial terms, but also organizational 
in order to increase economic efficiency above all.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Jose Marrero Camacho, member of </F>
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba and 
president of the Provincial Assembly of the People's Government 
in Vuelta Abajo, Pinar del Rio Province, by Guillermo Cabrera in 
Pinar del Rio -- live] 
  [Text] [Cabrera] The country is seriously trying to 
streamline internal finances and especially to make the economic 
policy more effective. What is Pinar del Rio doing in this 
regard? 
  [Marrero] Well, as you said, what Pinar del Rio is doing, 
and 
what we did initially, is to try to be more effective in our 
production, especially taking into account the fact that we have 
lost millions in our agriculture, in our Sugar Industry Ministry 
[Minaz], in our production. The first measure to adopt, and 
which we are doing, is discussing in each workers' meeting the 
process being carried out jointly with the Cuban Workers 
Federation, the workers' parliament in the workplace, discussing 
the things that can be done there to reduce production costs, to 
be more effective in our activities. These are the main measures. 
  [Cabrera] Excuse me, Marrero, how much did Pinar del Rio 
lose 
last year? 
  [Marrero] Some 400 million [currency not specified] taking 
into account the losses in the agriculture and construction 
sectors, the Minaz, and even the expenses incurred by the 
people's government. According to the latest figures we have 
been assessing, the loss totals approximately 389 million 
[currency not specified]. We must also mention other measures, 
as you said, which are being adopted. But the essential ones 
are: how to produce more and how to produce more effectively. 
And at what level are we taking these measures? We are taking 
them at the level of the people's council. This a subject being 
discussed at the people's council. We can see how our president, 
the members of our council are participating in each of these 
centers, evaluating suggestions, seeing what can be done, and 
where are our failures, seeking to solve these problems. If we 
manage to reduce our loss by 50 percent this year, it will be 
200 million [currency not specified], and 200 million with other 
measures. But this is not easy to achieve. However, we see that 
50 percent is due to inefficiency in production. We are seeing 
this in an essential sector. We are seeing this in the 
agricultural area, especially that having to do with tobacco. We 
are getting ready for a historical harvest. The climate is good, 
but we can see that salary cost in the tobacco field is 50 
percent of our salary costs in other places. We can better 
employ our labor force, we can reduce the daily movements of 
workers; we can better organize our battalions, and the Basic 
Cooperative Production Units [UBPC] will work more efficiently. 
So, there is an economic awareness which is leading people to 
see where they are spending each centavo, where are our 
resources are invested to make our production more efficient. 
  [Cabrera] How is the government working to.... 
  [Station announcer] Well, we have lost our communications 
with Pinar del Rio Province. We are going to try a new contact 
later through Radio Guama.

  [Text] The installation of a modern 10-kilowatt radio 
transmitter for the Villa Clara CMHW provincial network will be 
concluded shortly. This new transmitter will allow optimum 
signal quality on 840 khz and it will cover a transmitting range 
which is almost three times the current range. In other words, 
it is three times superior to the current equipment. This is 
the first 10-kilowatt Canadian-made transmitter installed in the 
country. The work was begun last week by a group of 
Communications Ministry engineers and technicians. 
  In addition to the Villa Clara CMHW transmitter, a similar 
one is being installed for Radio Rebelde on 1180 khz. This will 
improve the signal of this national radio station in our 
territory [no specific location given].

<F P=106> [Station commentary by Jose Armas] </F>
  [Text] A few days ago, Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd 
Niehaus said that if he is elected OAS Secretary General, he 
will work hard to ensure that Cuba will again become an active 
member of the regional organization. This is not the first time 
statements on this topic have been made by politicians, 
governments, or unity-seeking groups; however, the United States 
has always used various excuses to reject the idea of Cuba 
rejoining the organization. This time the rejection has been 
expressed by Alexander Watson, assistant secretary for 
Inter-American Affairs. When asked to comment on Bernd Niehaus' 
statement, Mr. Watson said that it was premature to consider 
Cuba's reinstatement in the OAS because, according to him, the 
factors that determined Cuba's exclusion from the OAS in 1962 
continue to prevail. 
  Let us stop here for a minute and add: At no time has Cuba 
requested reinstatement as a member of the OAS. Our country's 
position regarding this matter is as follows: If the regional 
organization believes it would be useful and convenient for 
Latin American unity, and should it request Cuba's reinstatement 
in the organization, then our country would have no reason to 
deny the request, despite the presence of the United States. 
Second, those excluding factors Mr. Watson has mentioned are 
none other than the socialist nature of the Cuban Revolution and 
Cuba's categorical refusal to assume the role of subordinate to 
U.S. policy. Since this is what Mr. Watson is referring to, then 
the factors continue to prevail. Third, Cuba, as a Latin 
American and Caribbean country, has worked as hard as any other 
country to ensure well-being and security for the peoples of the 
continent. It has worked hard to ensure unity and integration of 
the peoples of the continent, based on absolute respect for the 
rights of sovereignty and self-determination. 
  We wish to remind Mr. Watson that: Cuba is willing to be a 
part of a united and integrated Latin American and to sit down 
and broach any issue. President Fidel Castro, at the First 
Ibero-American Summit in Guadalajara, Mexico in 1991, said: The 
important thing is to unite our wills and efforts to ensure not 
only economic, but also political integration and unity. 
  There can be no greater commitment to a neighbor than this, 
whether or not we are members of the OAS. Mr. Watson must not 
forget this.

  [Excerpt] The deputies finally met in assembly. About 58 of 
them participated in the 25 January session. This time, all 
leanings were represented at the session. A true debate took 
place under the presidency of Deputy Frantz Robert Monde. 
Several issues were tackled. The president of the assembly took 
the opportunity to deny allegations by the Committee of Actions 
for National Reconciliation [CARENA] spokesman Adyjeangardy 
relating to possible participation by the Chamber of Deputies in 
the national conference on 6 February. It is simply false, he 
uttered. I have given my support to the principle, but the 
Chamber cannot send an official delegation to this conference, 
he explained. 
  What most attracted attention at this session was the 
resolution project presented by a group of parliamentarians of 
the south who have enjoined President Aristide to designate a 
new prime minister within the next 48 hours. This resolution 
caused much ink to flow in the Haitian parliament. It is a true 
ultimatum. An ultimatum cannot be issued to the president of a 
republic, one deputy objected. 
  It was a very animated, passionate debate during which 
partisans and opponents changed their viewpoints. Finally, the 
Assembly gave its sanction. Thanks to votes by the Alliance for 
Parliamentary Cohesion and the socialists, the principle of 
urgency was adopted by the Chamber. A special committee was 
constituted to give a ruling on the matter. 
  Urgency or ultimatum? The question remains unanswered. 
Behind 
the scenes of the Chamber, a resolution project aimed at 
dismissing President Aristide for serious violations of the 
Constitution is being discussed. On the side of the ACP, steps 
are being taken: they are reportedly finishing up this 
resolution project. But at yesterday's session, they were 
concerned instead with the justification or nonjustification of 
a resolution summoning the head of state to designate a new head 
of government. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Commercial enterprises will discontinue 
activities at noon on Friday, 28 January, and will resume them 
at noon on Wednesday, 9 February, to compel the parties involved 
in the Haitian crisis to submit themselves to the interests of 
the nation, forcing the sanctions against the country to be 
lifted. 
  This is the resolution adopted by the 15 employers' 
associations who gathered yesterday at the Villa Creole Hotel. 
Our colleague Jean Luckenson attended this session. Let us 
listen to his report. 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] All commercial and industrial 
enterprises and services will discontinue operations as of 
Friday, 28 January at noon, until Wednesday, 9 February 
inclusive, to force all concerned parties to submit themselves 
to the superior interests of the nation and to obtain the 
lifting of the embargo against Haiti. This is the resolution 
that emerged from the meeting held by 15 of the 16 employers' 
associations on Tuesday, 25 January, at the Villa Creole Hotel 
on the economic crisis the country has been experiencing for 
over 28 months, and which has become increasingly more alarming 
as a result of the fuel problem, and which has already caused 
much ink to flow. [passage omitted] 
  The decision resulting from this meeting does not concern 
the 
health sector. All of the employers agree to create a crisis 
committee, which will have the mission of ensuring follow-up of 
the resolutions that resulted from the 25 January meeting. A 
report will be sent to the employers' associations, which will 
meet again to adopt whatever additional measures might be 
necessary. 
  By the way, the employers' sector recommended that insofar 
as 
possible, its members take the interests of the workers into 
account. We should tell you that this meeting began at 0930 and 
ended at 1800, and was held at the initiative of the Haitian 
Chamber of Commerce [and Industry], which had several times 
requested the lifting of the embargo against Haiti.

  [Excerpts] President Aristide continues his tour of Canada. 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was due to meet with Canadian 
Prime Minister Jean Chretien on 25 January. 
  Following an initial meeting with Canadian Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Andre Ouellet, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, on 25 
January, also met with a Canadian delegation led by Mr. Ouellet. 
The two delegations, Haitian and Canadian, discussed a number of 
subjects, agreeing on the following points: 
  The imposition of a total embargo to relieve the situation 
in 
Haiti as soon as possible. 
  The training of a police force, outside of Haiti, with the 
collaboration of the United Nations or with the participation of 
several friendly countries. According to the agreement concluded 
by the two governments, this force will be trained not only in 
maintaining order and security, but also in respect for the laws 
and Constitution. [passage omitted] 
  During the talks, the two delegations also reviewed several 
areas of activity in which Haitian-Canadian cooperation would be 
broadened, including education, literacy, cooperatives, 
communication, and energy, following the return of democracy to 
Haiti. 
  It should also be noted that the possibility of a radio 
station broadcasting to Haiti has also been discussed.

  [Text] The Group of Citizens of the Southeast met with the 
press on 24 January regarding the resolution of the Congress for 
National Salvation, which was held on 18 to 20 January in 
Port-au-Prince and which formed a government of three members. 
Our correspondent in Jacmel, Pierre Nazon Beauliere, reports: 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] [Beauliere] The representatives 
of the Group of Citizens of the Southeast met with the press on 
25 January to explain to the population what they discussed and 
adopted in the 18 to 20 January congress in Port-au-Prince. The 
group called for a mobilization of Southeast citizens to support 
the resolution that emerged from the congress. For Mr. Ducles 
Louis, member of the Group of Citizens of the Southeast, the 
resolution of the congress will allow a solution to the crisis 
that the country has been facing for 28 months. The committee of 
the Group of Citizens of the Southeast is sending invitations 
throughout the region for people to participate in the 
installation of the Government of Public Security. 
  [Louis] [Words indistinct] most likely that we will have to 
install within the next 48 hours. Thus, our tasks right now in 
the Southeast... [changes thought] We left Port-au-Prince with 
the project of coordinating the bureau there, and we returned 
home to call for mobilization to Port-au-Prince for the 
installation of the Government of Public Security. [end 
recording] 
  [Beauliere] The resolution of the Congress for National 
Salvation did not get the approval of all political sectors in 
Jacmel. Some groups do not agree because not all the sectors are 
represented within that government. Others stated that they did 
not have enough information on the decision: Will it allow the 
embargo to be lifted and national reconciliation to take place? 
  The formation of the Group of Citizens of the Southeast and 
formation of the delegation representing the Southeast in the 18 
to 20 January congress in Port-au-Prince created great division 
within the sector always opposed to Father Aristide. They 
criticize one another over the people chosen to represent Jacmel 
in this congress. They think those choices were made in camera 
for personal interests. 
  This has been Pierre Nazon Beauliere in Jacmel for Radio 
Metropole. [end recording]

He also called for action to reduce crime and urged a ban on

Americans liked the president's speech. The oposition leader in 
the Senate, Bob Dole, used charts to suggest that Mr. Clinton's 
healthcare reform plan means more governmental control.

  [Text] Basseterre, St. Kitts, 26 Jan, CANA -- A new session 
of the St. Kitts and Nevis Parliament opened Wednesday to noisy 
opposition protests. 
  Several supporters of the opposition St. Kitts-Nevis Labour 
Party demonstrated outside parliament as Governor General Sir 
Clement Arrindell read the traditional throne speech. 
  The Labour Party is pressing for fresh general elections, 
saying the minority coalition People's Action Movement/Nevis 
Reformation Party government had no moral authority to run the 
twin-island state. 
  The last general election here, in November 1993, produced 
no 
clear winner. PAM and the Labour Party each took four of the 11 
seats at stake. 
  The Nevis Reformation Party picked up just one seat and the 
Concerned Citizen's Movement two. 
  The coalition controls just five of the 11 parliamentary 
seats. 
  Prime Minister Kennedy Simmonds this week appealed for the 
maintenance of law and order ahead of the demonstration. 
  He said the police had given no permission for the 
demonstration and warned: "Those who break the law will be dealt 
with appropriately." 
  On Wednesday, there was a strong police presence outside the 
parliament building.

  [Text] Basseterre, St. Kitts, 26 Jan, CANA -- At least two 
persons were reported to have been injured here Wednesday after 
police moved to disperse a crowd of opposition St Kitts-Nevis 
Labour Party (SKNLP) supporters calling for fresh general 
elections. 
  The protest outside government headquarters coincided with 
the start of a new parliamentary session at which members of the 
National Assembly, chosen in inconclusive general elections last 
November 29, took their oaths of office. 
  Eyewitnesses said there were loud explosions as police fired 
stun grenades to keep back the crowd and clear the way after the 
ceremony for the exit of Governor-general Sir Clement Arrindell, 
Prime Minister Dr Kennedy Simmonds and other officials. 
  One of the two persons taken to hospital for treatment, had 
head wounds after reportedly being struck with a baton by a 
police officer.

  [Excerpts] Basseterre, St. Kitts, 26 Jan, CANA -- St 
Kitts-Nevis' ruling minority coalition which is under increasing 
pressure from the opposition to resign, on Wednesday outlined 
its agenda for the new five year term. 
  Governor-general Sir Clement Arrindell, delivering the 
traditional throne speech at the opening of a new session of 
parliament, said particular attention would be paid to the 
special needs of low wage earners, the unemployed, senior 
citizens, women and young people. 
  "We will strengthen mechanisms aimed at ensuring that the 
fruits of economic expansion are equitably shared and enjoyed by 
all categories of persons in the society," Sir Clement told the 
National Assembly. 
  "We will also continue to implement a variety of programmes 
.... To provide a social safety net for the protection of lower 
income groups," the head of state added. 
  As Sir Clement spoke, loud explosions could be heard outside 
as the police fired stun grenades to keep back a crowd of 
opposition supporters calling for new elections. 
  The four elected St Kitts-Nevis Labour Party MPs boycotted 
the ceremony. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Linda Hutchinson] </F>
  [Text] Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, 25 Jan, CANA -- The 
Trinidad and Tobago Government will accelerate its efforts to 
recover money owed to it by at least six Caribbean Community 
(Caricom) countries, a government minister reported Tuesday. 
  "This process was started by the Ministry of Finance in 
1993. In 1994, the minister of finance will attempt to 
accelerate the process through direct contact with his 
counterparts in the defaulting countries," Junior Finance 
Minister Ken Valley said in the Senate. 
  "These efforts are expected to culminate in 1994 with the 
full regularisation of the arrears." He named Antigua and 
Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent 
and the Grenadines as countries not currently servicing all of 
their liabilities to Trinidad and Tobago. 
  "In some instances, no terms and conditions were determined 
for the repayment of the advances," he reported. "It is also the 
case in many instances that the countries defaulted several 
years ago. At this point, therefore, it has become necessary to 
verify the outstanding balances before the full recovery can be 
negotiated." At the end of December last year, U.S.517 million 
dollars was due to Trinidad and Tobago by its Caricom partners. 
The money represents only the bilateral portion of Trinidad and 
Tobago's debt portfolio. The multilateral arrears under the 
collapsed Caricom multilateral clearing facility amounted to 
almost 33 million dollars at the end of last year. 
  Out of the indebted countries, only Belize and St. Kitts are 
fully current and to-date they have repaid principal sums of TT 
65,620 dollars and 1,555,914 dollars (one TT dollar = 17.5 U.S. 
cents) respectively on the original loan balances, the minister 
said. Antigua and Barbuda owed U.S.2.5 million dollars; Dominica 
1.3 million dollars; Grenada over 600,000 dollars; Jamaica 
97,000 dollars; St. Lucia 388,000 dollars; and St. Vincent and 
the Grenadines 100,000 dollars. The Trinidad and Tobago 
Government was expected to sign, early this year, a bilateral 
agreement with the Government of Guyana, whose bilateral 
liability to the government here and the central bank was 
U.S.487 million dollars or 94 percent of the total debt. The 
Guyana debt was restructured in 1989 but subsequently fell into 
arrears. In August last year, a team of government officials 
from Trinidad met with Guyanese counterparts to negotiate a 
memorandum of understanding for the consolidation of the debt. A 
memorandum was signed by both governments and forms the basis of 
a bilateral agreement between both countries. 
  The agreement provides for the liquidation of the arrears of 
34.5 million dollars which was due from August 1990 to July 
1993. The agreement provides for a rescheduling of these arrears 
over a twelve-year period with a six-month moratorium on 
principal repayment. The 1993 agreement also provides for two 
semi-annual payments of 10.5 million dollars in 1994 and similar 
amounts in 1995 and 1996. 
  "Payments falling due under this agreement may be reduced by 
a range of debt conversion techniques including debt-equity 
swaps," said Valley. In pursuit of debt-equity swap 
opportunities, in March this year, the government is mounting an 
investment and trade mission to Guyana. The aim of the mission 
is to identify businesses in Guyana in which the participants, 
both from the private and state enterprises sectors, will be 
prepared to make equity investments." 
  With regard to the recovery of the amounts due to the 
Trinidad and Tobago Government and central bank by the 
government and Central Bank of Barbados, both governments last 
December signed a memorandum of understanding. The memorandum 
provides for the set-off of the government of Trinidad and 
Tobago's share of the liability of the cargo airline Caricargo 
to the Barbados National Bank against the debt of the Government 
of Barbados and the Central Bank of Barbados to Trinidad and 
Tobago. 
  Caricargo's debt to the Bank of Barbados is Bds59 million 
dollars (one Bds dollar = 50 U.S. cents) with Trinidad and 
Tobago's share being 29.5 million dollars. 
  The debt set-off will result in Barbados' U.S.25 million 
dollar liability being reduced by U.S.15.3 million dollars.

<F P=106> [From the "National" newscast] </F>
  [Text] In an exclusive interview granted to the "National" 
newscast, Regiment Commander Fernando Caldera [National Police 
commander] said the population should rest assured that the 
Police will guarantee public order and security during the 
current transportation strike, which Caldera described as 
generally peaceful with no regrettable violence. 
  Commander Fernando Caldera asserted that the transportation 
workers' strike has not exceeded the limits of peace and 
tranquility. To contribute to that atmosphere, the Police have 
allowed vehicles to be parked on the streets so long as they are 
not blocking traffic. 
  Caldera also listed the incidents that have taken place, 
including the arrest of two armed persons and some broken 
windows on vehicles belonging to those who support the strike as 
well as to those who continue to provide service to the 
population. 
  Caldera denied that there have been traffic jams in Managua 
or in any other part of the country. 
  [Begin Caldera recording] The only incident that has taken 
place was this morning in Ciudad Sandino, where a group of 
transportation workers blocked the road. We went there and were 
able to persuade them to unblock the road, then we left a 
stronger Police contingent in the area. 
  There was another small incident. Some young children -- 13 
or 14 years old -- threw some stones, but it was not important. 
They didn't do any damage. 
  Some have said there was a traffic jam on 4th Avenue, but 
that is not true. We also received reports of a traffic jam in 
a place called El Capulina in Granada, but that was not true, 
either. There were buses on the sides of the street, but no 
traffic jam. 
  Generally speaking, the atmosphere has been tranquil in the 
rest of the country. [end recording] 
  Caldera denied the statements made by Gustavo Aguiluz, a 
member of the National Transportation Commission, who asserted 
that 20 taxi drivers had been arrested. 
  [Begin Caldera recording; in progress] ... saying we had 
arrested 20 taxi drivers in the (Repotola) 15. We were very 
annoyed by that, because if, as a union leader, he wants to heat 
up the strike, he has every right. However, we do not agree 
that he should do it at the expense of the Police, that is to 
say, by causing a state of alert at the expense of the Police. 
There have been absolutely no incidents in (Repotola) 15. [end 
recording] 
  The Police will continue to take the necessary measures to 
maintain public order, thus preventing the appearance of 
firearms and violence. 
  [Begin Caldera recording] People who have carried weapons 
during past events should indeed worry because we are keeping an 
eye on them. Those who have not carried weapons can feel calm. 
Simply put, everyone who we suspect of carrying weapons or 
anyone who we know was armed during past events should worry, 
because we are keeping an eye on them. It is true. Why? 
Because that person was carrying a weapon. 
  Everyone who has not been involved in violence can be calm 
because we have no problem with them. Let's put it that way. 
  However, it is definitely untrue that we have arrested or 
harassed anyone. I will say, however, that anyone who is going 
around armed should worry. That is our duty, and we are 
determine to banish violence and the use of violent methods. 
[end recording] 
  The Police's main concern is to keep the strike from 
creating 
a violent situation of which criminals could take advantage. 
  Caldera then emphasized the Police's continuous surveillance 
and willingness to use force if the situation warrants such 
actions.

<F P=106> [Report by Elizabeth Diaz Otero from Los Pinos Presidential </F>
Residence in Mexico City; from the "Vector 21" newscast] 
  [Excerpts] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari traveled 
this morning to Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital of Chiapas State, 
to give his full attention and time to efforts for promoting 
peace, justice, and democracy, as well as to efforts to support 
the human rights of the people of Chiapas State. At the 
Government Palace, the president met with 42 representatives of 
280 peasant and Indian organizations. For one and one-half 
hours, he listened to the demands of the various 
representatives, all of whom spoke with great sincerity, and he 
had answers for each one of them. He told them that, first, the 
emergency would be addressed, but he added that measures also 
would be taken to combat and resolve long-term problems. 
  President Salinas listed the specific plans to assist those 
people who have been affected by the violence that has been 
unleashed since 1 January. He said: 
  1. In terms of supplies, Conasupo [National Company for 
Basic 
Commodities] Director Javier Bonilla Garcia will remain in 
Chiapas to ensure regular food supplies to the conflict zone 
without overlooking other areas. 
  2. In terms of medical services, the Health Secretariat and 
the Mexican Social Security Institute will establish aid 
centers, especially for families within the conflict zone. 
  3. Widows and orphans will receive aid through a trust that 
must begin operating before the end of the week. It will give 
government assistance to widows, as well as scholarships to 
orphans of the conflict. 
  4. The authorities will offer facilities that will enable 
families to return. 
  5. Facilities will be offered to the State Council of 
Indigenous and Peasant Organizations of Chiapas. 
  6. The president said that human rights will be respected, 
and he gave assurances that the commission headed by Dr. Jorge 
Madrazo will not conceal anything and will review with 
impartiality and resolve all reports from and charges made by 
the people. 
  7. Regarding Agrarian topics, Agrarian Reform Secretary 
Victor Cervera will open an office in Chiapas to help in 
whatever way it can and to offer alternatives to land demands 
that cannot be met. 
  8. To benefit conflict participants under the Amnesty Law, 
Dr. Jose Naro Robles, technical secretary for the Amnesty Law 
Commission, is also in Chiapas State. The president explained 
that in terms of crimes committed prior to the enforcement of 
the Amnesty Law, the state government, together with the 
National Indian Institute, will study how to implement a 
comprehensive system of justice, which will include reforms to 
the Penal Code. 
  9. The president also dealt with the issue of peace -- the 
great goal being sought at this moment in Chiapas State. Let us 
listen to what the president said: 
  [Begin Salinas recording] We want peace, and not merely to 
return to the old situation. We want peace, but we want to 
begin on a new footing. I quote [words indistinct] said: A new 
stage in Chiapas State of solidarity, respect, support, and 
construction. This is the promise all of us are making in favor 
of Chiapas, and I want to tell you [words indistinct]. I am 
convinced that this will allow us to move ahead in the projects, 
as was explained here, not only has prevented the solution of 
urgent problems, but also in- depth problems. [sentence as 
heard] This is what it is all about, and this will prevent a 
return to the previous situation. We will confront this 
situation with the agenda that several of you have outlined, and 
this will enable us to jointly enter this new stage. [end 
recording] 
  President Carlos de Gortari's trip was doubtless unexpected, 
but it was carried out after peasant and Indian organizations 
last night invited him to travel as soon as possible to Ocosingo 
or to San Cristobal de las Casas to listen first-hand to those 
affected by the violence there. 
  On Tuesday, 25 days after the conflict began, the president 
began his trip at approximately 0800. He arrived at Military 
Base No. 6 in Tuxtla Gutierrez accompanied by his private 
secretary (Justo Ceja) and General Arturo Cardona, chief of the 
presidential general staff. The meeting with the Indians and 
peasants was held at the Government Palace. After listening to 
all of the participants -- 20 in all -- the president stressed 
that the government will comply with all that was promised, 
adding that it will continue to nurture the project he called 
Life Through Dialogue, Reason, and Respect for Human Life [para 
la vida, por la via del dialogo, la razon el respeto a la vida 
humana]. 
  The president left a message for the people of Chiapas. This 
message was broadcast over the local radio and television 
stations. The message justifies the Army's work in Chiapas 
State. [passage omitted] 
  At about 1500, the president returned to the official Los 
Pinos residence. Before entering, he was interviewed by 
reporters. He was asked about the work of Manuel Camacho Solis, 
commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas. The 
president responded by saying Manuel Camacho has fulfilled the 
responsibilities he assumed, adding that Camacho Solis has 
exhibited loyalty to the institutions, the president of the 
Republic, and the entire Mexican nation. 
  In addition, when asked whether the national solidarity 
program would remain in effect, the president said solidarity 
has proven it can produce specific results for the benefit of 
the poor, and this is why the program will continue to be 
strengthened, because this has been requested by those who have 
been helped by the program.

<F P=106> [News conference by Pablo Vigil, construction and </F>
transportation minister, and Government Minister Alfredo 
Mendieta with unidentified reporters on 25 January in Managua; 
from the "This Morning" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Reporter] Does this mean you 
will not continue the talks with the transportation commission 
[words indistinct] Engineer Vigil? 
  [Vigil] Absolutely not. We will continue to talk with all 
groups. We will always be willing to debate, discuss, and hear 
their opinion on the communique. We are always willing to 
participate in discussions. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] stop the strike decreed by the 
transportation commissions [words indistinct] since Monday? 
  [Vigil] We believe the measures are quite beneficial for the 
transportation sector and the general public. That includes the 
production sector, which will also enjoy the benefits. We do 
not think there is any reason to continue the stoppage. We are 
giving an overall solution, a clear and positive solution, to 
members of the transportation sector, the people in general, and 
all groups that have not supported the stoppage to achieve peace 
and help the economic reactivation. Thus the growth process we 
began in January will not be obstructed by a situation that 
might be extremely dangerous. That is why we have decided to 
solve many of the problems discussed during the preliminary 
meetings, and the solutions are included in this document. 
  [Reporter] The communique and the talks you held have [words 
indistinct] official communique. 
  [Vigil] In most cases, yes. 
  [Reporter] When will the [words indistinct]? 
  [Vigil] The measures taken by the Nicaraguan Government are 
intended to guarantee peace for the citizens and to overcome the 
impasse once and for, because it has cost the government between 
7 and 8 million cordobas. We will recover the sum with better 
tax collection, meaning by increasing the efficiency of the 
administration. There will not be any new taxes. This must be 
quite clear from the beginning. We will make tax collection 
more efficient to create the revenues outlined in the budget, 
which was submitted to the National Assembly. 
  [Reporter] [Question indistinct] 
  [Vigil] We can try. The next agreement will be based on 
established policies and current prices at the international 
level. 
  [Reporter] What happens [words indistinct] if the strike 
continues and the [words indistinct]. What will the government 
do tomorrow? 
  [Vigil] Minister Mendieta will answer that question. 
  [Mendieta] First it is important to emphasize the 
government's efforts to find a negotiated solution to the 
transportation sector's problems. As the communique stated, it 
has been practically impossible to get these organizations 
together and find a joint solution. We believe the Government 
Ministry is capable of guaranteeing, through the National 
Police, the free circulation of people and vehicles throughout 
the national territory. We have deployed Police, Special 
Disarmament Brigades, and Special Riot Police forces to 
guarantee this free circulation. We have also deployed special 
units to clear areas where people have tried to close the 
streets. This has already been done. You can confirm that this 
has been permanently guaranteed throughout Managua despite 
threats that traffic would be obstructed. 
  Moreover, we want to point out that anyone who endorses a 
strike or an illegal stoppage will be punished according to the 
law. We want to state that all vehicles used to obstruct 
traffic and free circulation will be fined. Consequently, we 
think the measures taken today by the government should be 
sufficient to encourage people to set aside their current 
attitude. Nevertheless, we believe some people may still be 
trying to find pretexts for continuing their actions, but they 
will no longer be considered a result of the transportation 
sector problem. We would have to investigate those persons' 
plans. 
  We believe these measures are a clear answer to the 
proposals 
presented by the transportation sector. They will solve most of 
the problems we have discussed, and above all, they will 
guarantee peace for the citizens, as Minister Vigil said. We 
hope there are no more situations of this kind. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] would you explain how will 
you manage to [words indistinct]? 
  [Vigil] We created the Temporary Transportation Council 
[Consejo Temporal del Transporte], but because some of the 
federations objected to the legal formation of this council, we 
decided to form a commission made up of all sectors that wish to 
participate so they, the sector representatives, can work with 
us to draft the new law that will be presented to the National 
Assembly. We do not want to draft that bill unilaterally. In 
fact, there is a pledge for an agreement, and the National 
Assembly president thinks it is very important for the Assembly 
transportation, energy, and communication commission to 
participate in drafting this new law. 
  [Reporter] There has been some discontent with bonds [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Vigil] The bond process went very smoothly. In some minor 
cases the cooperatives did not provide the proper cooperation, 
and the lists needed to clearly define the number of members 
were not received on time. We must remember that many times 
there is a certain fluidity within the transportation 
cooperatives, with members moving from one cooperative to 
another, or one person resigning and another one joining. In 
December we established an effective system with the Finance 
Ministry to deal with this. We think we can improve it even 
further, with help from the cooperatives, to ensure that each 
member receives his corresponding coupons. 
  [Reporter] The organizations have said that they will meet 
with you again tomorrow. Will you accept? 
  [Vigil] The organizations that were here and that left late 
without reaching any agreement have been informed of this 
document. They are studying it, and we will meet with them 
tomorrow.

  [Text] Managua, 26 Jan (AFP) -- Protest organizers assert 
that over 100 people have been arrested and 10 injured in the 
repression unleashed this morning by Nicaraguan policemen 
against transportation workers, who for the third consecutive 
day have been on an indefinite national strike. 
  The police repression came on the heels of a government 
announcement at midnight on Tuesday of a package of measures to 
benefit the transportation workers. The workers rejected the 
offer as insufficient and threatened to strengthen their 
protests against fuel prices. 
  Roberto Gonzalez, leader of the National Transportation 
Commission (CNT), denounced the arrest of "more than 100 
companeros," while the Sandinist Radio Ya reported 299 arrests. 
Government and police authorities have yet to confirm the 
figures. 
  Bus transportation was at a total standstill in the capital 
and various other locations around the country today. Some 
people erected barricades with bricks removed from the streets 
in parts of the city, reporters have confirmed. 
  The largest barricades were erected in the eastern part of 
the capital opposite the Parrales Vallejos Bus Cooperative, 
whose members are wearing masks to avoid being identified by the 
authorities. The cooperative members are apparently unarmed. 
  Riot police have been discreetly deployed in different parts 
of the capital to keep the peace. 
  Despite the blockades erected in three parts of the capital, 
the flow of private vehicles is normal. Supermarkets, banks, 
and businesses have kept doors open, but few people are on the 
streets. 
  Finance Minister Emilio Pereira asked that order be 
reestablished and said that "a country cannot be held hostage." 
He accused transportation workers of wanting to "stop the 
vehicle called Nicaragua," thus preventing the nation from 
overcoming its current serious economic stagnation. 
  Pereira reiterated the government's decision -- announced 
last night -- to freeze the price of gasoline, currently at 
$2.35 per gallon ($3.78 liter), until April. 
  However, transportation owners demand that the price of fuel 
be reduced to the level of Central American prices, which are 
below $2.00 per gallon. 
  The government also froze the price of kerosene and butane 
gas until April and decided to reduce the price of diesel to the 
price that existed in June 1993. 
  The finance minister also announced the delivery of coupons 
to taxi drivers and the elimination of the tax on license plates 
and traffic permits. 
  Government authorities called on transportation workers to 
form a transportation commission so a transportation law can be 
drafted quickly, as is demanded by the CNT, which is promoting 
the strike. 
  With these provisions, according to Transportation Minister 
Pablo Vigil, "there is no reason to prolong the strike," 
although it seems to be getting worse, according to the strike 
leaders. 
  Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta warned last night that 
the Riot Police, Special Disarmament Brigades (BED), and other 
security corps have been deployed to safeguard order.

<F P=106> [Report by Ernesto Garcia from "The Nation Radio Newspaper" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] The National Police [PN] confirmed this afternoon 
that two people have died and two others were seriously injured, 
all Hondurans. A police report states the dead as Carlos Mejia 
and an unidentified Honduran woman, and the injured as Hondurans 
Abel and Lorena Dubon Pazos. 
  The tragic accident occurred 7 km on the Northern Highway, 
which was blocked by a bus belonging to the Unidos 
Transportation Cooperative, license plate GB-0109. The bus was 
participating in a three-day-old strike called by transportation 
personnel against the Chamorro administration. The name of the 
bus' owner that caused the fatal accident is still unknown. 
  Commander Franco Montealegre, PN inspector general, 
presented 
a final count of those arrested in the wake of violent 
disturbances involving transportation carriers, which started 
early today and lasted until noon today at the PN Station No. 6, 
when the relatives of those arrested opposed their transfer to 
police installations. The police leader reported 206 arrested so 
far. He added that 19 minors, between the ages of 13 and 14 
years old, were released. 
  The cooperatives with the largest number of arrested members 
are: the 2 August Cooperative with 12; Jorge Salazar 
Cooperative, 22; Ricardo Morales Cooperative, 31; (Arlensiu) 
Cooperative, 36; and Democratic Efforts Cooperative, 20. The 
police report states that 12 of those arrested do not belong to 
a cooperative. 
  Commander Montealegre categorically denied that the police 
fired on the relatives of those arrested at noon today at the PN 
Station No. 6. He also denied the police attacked media 
representatives: 
  [Begin Montealegre recording] [Words indistinct] it is said 
they used excessive force. Quite the contrary, they faced heavy 
resistance during the operation [words indistinct] there are no 
injures, as they claim. That is, the police acted prudently. The 
police acted in a legitimate fashion. The transportation 
carriers' actions [words indistinct] they violate the rights of 
others. [end recording] 
  There are still roadblocks in front of the Sandinist 
Barrales-Vallejo Cooperative headquarters at this time. A police 
cordon, which was established about 100 meters from the 
roadblock erected by the Sandinist cooperative, is still in 
place. The military controls the main roads. Police checkpoints 
are still in place, and groups of transportation strikers are 
still picketing the area.

  [Excerpt] Managua, 26 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- Dozens of taxi 
drivers have parked their vehicles in front of the Government 
Ministry building in this capital to demand the release of 225 
strikers who were arrested during the third day of an indefinite 
transportation strike. 
  The official radio station reported that the number of taxis 
participating in the protest could reach 200 vehicles and that 
police have intervened to guarantee the free movement of 
vehicles and pedestrians in the area. 
  Meanwhile, Sandinist Deputy William Ramirez told the media 
that police have stopped transferring 65 of the 225 arrested 
strikers to the Police Processing Unit out of fear of strikers 
staging a "rescue attempt." Police have charged the strikers 
with meeting with criminal intent and disrupting public order. 
The strikers were arrested after they set up the first 
barricades and "blockaded" streets with buses and taxis. 
  After reports by relatives of police beatings, Nicaraguan 
Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta authorized representatives 
of Human Rights Commissions to visit the prisoners to verify 
their situation. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [News conference by Finance Minister Emilio Pereira and </F>
Construction and Transportation Minister Pablo Vigil with 
unidentifed reporters; place not given; from the "News and a 
Little Bit More" newscast -- live] 
  [Excerpts][Pereira] Good evening, Radio Nicaragua, and good 
evening to all Nicaraguans who are listening to us at this time. 
We would like to share with you our assessment of today's events 
in response to the measures the government took last night 
concerning fuel prices and the decision to instruct the 
Government Ministry on the preservation of public order. 
  The response has definitely been positive and the situation 
is returning to normal. We see the people are starting to return 
to work and their other activities little by little. [passage 
omitted] 
  I am going to allow Construction and Transportation Minister 
Pablo Vigil to speak because he has been monitoring the 
transportation situation throughout the day. He will now speak 
to you. 
  [Vigil] Good evening, Radio Nicaragua listeners. As Dr. 
Pereira noted, we assessed the development of the transportation 
situation nationwide. At this time we can confirm, from touring 
Managua and based on reports we have received from the regions 
of the country, that the police have guaranteed unobstructed 
transit on all our roads and highways in a very normal way, 
except for a few points in Managua, near the facilities of the 
Parrales-Vallejo Cooperative. 
  We have observed that citizens have been able to freely move 
about and drive the streets of Managua and the highways today. 
The police have maintained constant patrols. We noticed great 
calm. Certain routes of urban and interurban bus lines have 
started to operate. There was greater activity in the afternoon. 
We noticed a normalization in activities. We think this is a 
positive response by citizens to the measures the government 
announced on 25 January. 
  We urge carriers who have not yet returned to work to do so 
tomorrow because we think that to increase production and 
progress we must show support and solidarity with those who have 
made great efforts to reach their workplaces. 
  Fortunately, people have found solutions to their 
transportation problems. This has prevented an interruption of 
most economic activities in the country. Therefore, I urge the 
people in general, those who have not yet returned to work, 
especially the drivers, to do so on 27 January. 
  Of course, as the government, we are always willing to talk 
with all sectors. As representatives of the transportation 
sector, we are always willing to negotiate and talk with the 
various members of a sector as important as this one. 
  We must clarify that the fuel problem is not the only one 
facing the transportation sector. It is essential we maintain a 
dialogue, and an attitude that will allow us to find 
alternatives to ensure the citizens have adequate transportation. 
  Radio Nicaragua, thank you very much. To the Nicaraguan 
people, we say the government is very determined to find 
solutions to all problems to ensure we will have a better 
Nicaragua in the future. Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Article by Alejandro Martinez Cuenca] </F>
  [Text] The year 1993 is about to end. Taking a look 
backward is always a good exercise. If we do so with an open and 
constructive attitude, we may find out where the problems were 
and where we can refocus our actions to help improve future 
prospects. 
  Many international, political, economic, and social factors 
were present in 1993. They all had an impact on the year now 
ending, one of the worst of the last 14 years for Nicaragua. 
  The living conditions of large parts of society 
deteriorated; 
a considerable number of agricultural, industrial, commercial, 
and service enterprises had to close their doors or are now on 
the verge of bankruptcy. The unemployed population has continued 
to grow; frustration levels have soared; there has been a surge 
in crime; and the insecurity felt by citizens all over the 
nation has increased. 
  Delays in the arrival of foreign aid and the strings 
attached 
to it have served as an economic disincentive and have had 
psychological repercussions on important sectors of our national 
life. In addition, the continuing infighting of Nicaragua's 
political class has fostered a climate of constant anxiety. 
Moreover, the rigid application of erratic and contradictory 
economic policies has deteriorated still further the social 
conditions of the majority of the population. 
<H5>  Economics </H5>
  Despite all this, particularly the erroneous economic 
policies of the year that is ending, and thanks to the good luck 
of abundant rainfalls all over Nicaragua, some encouraging 
signals for agricultural prospects in 1994 have appeared. 
Agriculture is the backbone of Nicaragua's economic and social 
life. 
  There is no doubt that the transition process Nicaragua is 
going through is complex and difficult. Inconsistency in the 
application of economic instruments and a highly 
compartmentalized view of economic, political, and social 
processes, combined with the difficulties imposed by the 
international context, meant that the economic recovery and 
social stability goals for 1993 were not achieved. 
  The economy is still seen by government policymakers as part 
of an accounting system, in which all the effort is concentrated 
on making sure that the various accounts close out, without 
thinking that the economy is more than simple addition and 
subtraction. Economics involves social and productive relations 
that must be taken into account, but 1993 was marked by a deep 
recession that will produce a new decline in the GDP [gross 
domestic product] of 0.7 percent and a further erosion of per 
capita income. 
<H5>  Policies and Undesired Effects </H5>
  Unemployment and underemployment rose to over 50 percent of 
the economically active population; a third of the nation's 
households are living in extreme poverty. 
  Deregulation and privatization of the economy, intended to 
reduce state intervention and shift more responsibility to the 
private sector, have not helped to stimulate the economic and 
productive process. 
  On the contrary, the state has been reduced, but its 
regulatory capacity has not grown stronger; instead, this 
process has created greater disruption in the production and 
circulation of goods and services, with negative effects on the 
population. 
  The existence of a certain overvaluation of the cordoba in 
relation to the dollar, the high degree of indexing of the 
economy, and the rapid tariff-lowering process were factors 
which, rather than helping to develop markets, have distorted 
markets. These policies have deepened the economic recession and 
produced a greater concentration of income. 
  As production has continued to fall, the economy has grown 
more vulnerable to the vagaries of foreign aid. Therefore, 
uncertainty and difficulties related to the availability of 
foreign resources may influence changes in economic policy; 
these factors fed the inflationary spiral and people's 
expectations. 
  The major policies of 1993 that shored up the stabilization 
program produced undesired effects. Among those are: 

  -  a) Credit policy. Keeping interest rates high was a 
stimulus to attract resources for the financial system, although 
they do not support a real credit expansion that will promote 
production. High interest rates combined with the loan 
guarantees demanded by commercial banks have barred access to 
credit for a large number of small producers. 
  -  b) Exchange 
policy. The strong indexing of the economy has kept the exchange 
rate from serving as a stimulus for export production. 
Maintaining an overvalued exchange rate in the absence of other 
complementary policies has slashed gross international reserves, 
making economic stability even more vulnerable. 

<H5>    The Rainy Season, a Positive Factor </H5>

  -  c) Fiscal policy. The monetary policy of 1993, which 
continued to impact on domestic demand, brought about a 
reduction in real income, leading to a highly restrictive 
spending policy. This had the effect of worsening the economy in 
general, causing a deterioration in basic services and higher 
unemployment. 
  -  d) Fixed investment, estimated at 13 percent of 
the GDP, remained depressed. Public investment, which represents 
about 60 percent of the total, was less strong than originally 
projected because of problems with formulation, execution, and 
follow-up, among others. Private investment experienced a very 
slight and insufficient growth as if to compensate for cuts in 
the originally programmed investment. This was due to a lack of 
clear policies and signals to economic agents, combined with 
political instability. 
  -  e) Despite the factors mentioned above 
and the recessive character of the economy during 1993, the good 
rainy season will permit an increase in agricultural production 
in the 1993-94 season, which could generate moderate economic 
growth next year. 
  A rapid economic recovery supported by new stimulus policies 
that should be introduced in 1994 could allow us to turn the 
1993 experience around and move to a position of hope and 
greater optimism. Then we may be able to say that 1993 was the 
year when we hit the bottom of the barrel, and now the only way 
we can go is up, as we try not to sink still further in a search 
for new "false bottoms."

<F P=106> [Article by Aldo Diaz Lacayo] </F>
  [Excerpts] Nicaragua's political physiognomy has radically 
changed in the past six months. Five different but ultimately 
interrelated events that occurred in this period have 
exacerbated and, at the same time, clarified the profound 
political crisis in Nicaragua: the Esteli massacre; the dual 
Quilali-Managua kidnapping; the presidential announcement of the 
removal of General Humberto Ortega Saavedra from the Army 
leadership; the transport workers' strike; and the dispute 
between the National Assembly, through the Sandinist bench, and 
Comandante Daniel Ortega Saavedra, secretary general of the FSLN 
[Sandinist National Liberation Front]. The direct consequences 
of each of these events are undeniable and obvious: the Army's 
loss of prestige; the consolidation of UNO [National Opposition 
Union] as a valid participant in resolving the political crisis; 
the new dispute between the executive and the EPS [Sandinist 
People's Army]; the evidence that the government's economic 
problem is limited to controlling inflation and reducing the 
fiscal deficit; and the great importance to the public of the 
Sandinist leadership's internal crisis. On the margins of all 
this, the overall consequences of the intensification of the 
crisis possess a terminal seriousness; they necessarily imply a 
qualitative change. 
  To start with, for the first time since she became 
president--over three years ago--the president is generally 
perceived as directly responsible for three of the five events 
listed above; this means that also for the first time the people 
identify her as in charge of the government. In other words, the 
intensification of the crisis has apparently obliterated the 
president's image as chief of state, changing it from 
that of a naive but manipulated governor, outside the loop of 
administrative blunders and widespread official corruption, to 
that of a person who shares responsibility for this 
mismanagement. This change in image has many political 
implications. In the first place, the political establishment 
will direct its batteries against her, more and more ignoring 
Antonio Lacayo; the same thing is going to happen--or perhaps is 
already happening--in the government-Washington relationship. 
Secondly, in these conditions, the only option the president has 
is a national accord to complete her government with the seal of 
its only moderately successful policy: reconciliation and 
peace. If she is not able to do this, she will be forced to 
seek alliances with forces on the far right, to the detriment of 
the precarious political stability achieved so far, and also to 
the detriment--in the third place--of her alliance with the 
Sandinist leadership. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  The Crisis in the Sandinist Top Leadership </H5>
  Moreover, the impact of this intensification of the crisis 
on 
the Sandinist leadership has also been brutal, so much so that 
it can be said that the Sandinist leadership has been the 
hardest hit of all. In this regard, the first thing this 
analysis reveals is that the Sandinist Front's national 
leadership has been forced to recognize as full participants not 
only UNO--which in the past it ignored--but also several of the 
small groups that make it up, some of them as leadership groups. 
Consequently, the Sandinist leadership has not been able to 
elude--much less neutralize--the UNO tactic of creating several 
fronts for fighting the Sandinist Front, no matter whether some 
of these fronts are presented as quasi-allied and others as open 
enemies. In negotiating with the government, the Sandinist Front 
has been weakened. The greatest expression of this weakness is 
the complexity that the mechanics of the national dialogue has 
taken on: interminable bilateral discussions prior to a 
constantly more remote general dialogue among all the parties. 
  This weakening of the Sandinist Front, though, is not the 
result of a sudden strengthening of UNO or the government; it is 
the result of the internal crisis of Sandinism itself that has 
reached its highest level, first in the public confrontation 
with the president on the occasion of the announcement, also 
public, that she made at the anniversary celebration of the EPS, 
and later in the open clash between the secretary general of the 
Sandinist Front and the head of the Sandinist bench in the 
National Assembly (parliament). The first demonstrated 
Sandinism's lack of real weight in its relations with the 
government, so painstakingly and at such great cost worked out 
by the national leadership, using the argument--denied by 
reality--of preserving to the utmost the gains of the 
revolution; and the second is the new balance of power inside 
the Sandinist leadership, which also stems from its own 
weakness. Comandante Daniel Ortega has in essence lost the 
activist support of the FNT [National Workers Front], as it has 
virtually ceased to exist as a consequence of privatization and 
more specifically of the newly created APT [Workers' Ownership 
Sector]; that is, as a consequence of the party 
leader-worker/businessman dispute; nor has Dr. [Sergio] Ramirez 
managed to develop partisan support through the centrist trend 
that has faded away. 
<H5>  The High Price of the Head of Rene Vivas </H5>
  In addition, if the Sandinist leadership had placed any 
hopes 
on the Army, it is clear that those expectations are about to 
become or have already become another chimera: with its own 
internal crisis, the Army cannot now realistically help the 
Sandinist Front. Nor can anything be said about the police. It 
is as if the police did not even exist, so great was the price 
of the head of Comandante Rene Vivas, a concession made more in 
the context of the Sandinist Front's internal struggles than as 
a strategic decision. The concession of the police to these 
imperial demands, as some well-known members with a long history 
in the party had pointed out earlier, anticipated the new 
situation of the EPS, but those who are deaf and blind refuse to 
hear and to see. 
  As a result, the Sandinist leadership will no longer be able 
to ignore the demands of the party's grass roots for the accord 
that without any doubt will have to be reached in the first 
Extraordinary Congress: that no member of the national 
leadership may run as a presidential candidate in the 1996 
general elections, and that the party must immediately begin to 
promote a number of other party members for that purpose. This 
gives new importance to the Extraordinary Congress and a new 
reason for the Sandinist grassroots to fight for a precise 
statement of their objectives. The national leadership 
apparently got itself into trouble without any hope of escape 
when it gave up the Sandinist Front's political program, which 
has never lost its force, in a vain search for an alternative to 
neoliberalism. In addition to being the best alternative, that 
political program is the best weapon to combat the neoliberal 
project; so much so that a great price was paid to convince the 
world that the Sandinist political program was strategic and not 
tactical in nature. 
<H5>  FSLN Leadership Weak, Grass Roots Huge </H5>
  Of course, in terms of leadership the Sandinist Front is a 
very weakened party, but at its grass-roots level it remains a 
huge, strong, combative...and disorganized party. It is weakened 
because of the daily struggle for survival amid unemployment and 
discrimination--even of the Sandinist brothers 
themselves--because of the organic dispersion brought about by 
the real split in the leadership and because of the lack of 
clear objectives and of a consistent organic structure. So, once 
again bringing together the party's grass roots is a problem of 
consequence between partisan objectives and political action, 
between principles and discourse, between theory and practice. 
That is why it is useless to talk about organic reorganization 
without attacking the in-depth problem, the problem of the 
party's true nature. That is something that only the 
Extraordinary Congress can resolve, so long as it acts in 
accordance with the demands of the grass roots; this is another 
argument in favor of the Sandinist Front's First Extraordinary 
Congress. 
<H5>  Government More Isolated Than Ever </H5>
  The government is obviously not in very good shape. On the 
contrary, it is now more isolated than ever, with the entire 
national political spectrum arrayed against it, and it has only 
a promise of aid, with strings attached, from Washington. The 
government is so isolated that the national consensus is that it 
should end its term whenever it can. The advantage of this is 
that it requires a greater consensus concerning a minimum 
national accord enabling all the participants to prepare for the 
1996 general elections in a climate of reasonable political 
stability. The struggle, then, is taking place around the 
national dialogue, where political stability is more a means 
than an end, a means for the great electoral contest of 1996. 
The disadvantage is that this struggle may once again alter the 
national political physiognomy, both because of the balance of 
power that may result from the national dialogue and because of 
the definitive frustration arising from this dialogue that could 
reach the groups on the far right. Although in terms of numbers 
these groups are minuscule, they have a great reproductive 
capacity through the media, including the Sandinist media. 
  In reality, during the past six months, Nicaragua has become 
another country.

<F P=106> [Interview with Eduardo Ishii Ito, executive secretary of </F>
the Ministry of the Presidency's International Technical 
Cooperation, CTI, agency, by unidentified EL PERUANO reporter; 
place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [EL PERUANO] What is CTI's 
situation in Peru now that conversations with the U.S. 
Government have resumed? 
  [Ishii] Our International Technical Cooperation is going 
through a process of growth and clear evolution at a time when 
we are resuming full diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial 
level. 
  [EL PERUANO] Regarding the national drug prevention and 
control plan, what agreements have been reached with U.S. 
Ambassador Alvin Adams? What is the implementation schedule? 
  [Ishii] The U.S. ambassador met the president of the 
commission responsible for drawing up the drug control and 
prevention master plan. He offered his cooperation, in the 
methodological aspect, for writing the draft of the document 
that will be presented at the end of February in accordance with 
deadlines established by law. [passage omitted] 
  [EL PERUANO] What agreements are being implemented and what 
ones are in a process of approval by the CTI in Peru? 
  [Ishii] During 1933 we created joint commissions to 
negotiate 
and program important projects for the country's development. We 
arranged intergovernmental meetings with Germany, Spain, the 
Netherlands, and the EEC. We also arranged other preparatory 
meetings for negotiating diverse projects. This year we will 
have joint commissions with Switzerland, Great Britain, Spain, 
the Netherlands, and other countries. [passage omitted] 
  [EL PERUANO] Is there a certain method or system developed 
by 
the CTI in Peru that is being copied by other countries? How 
does that system operate? 
  [Ishii] Technical cooperation in Peru has developed and 
implemented diverse ways of implementing projects, particularly 
in emergency zones. The implementation of small social interest 
projects (Pepicos) and the creation of cooperation funds, which 
gather and convert donations of food, equipment, and machinery 
into cash, are important. We have used those funds to implement 
sustainable development projects in areas where the government 
has very little influence. We also must stress that project 
implementation is direct, that is, it is carried out by those 
will benefit from the program. 
  [EL PERUANO] How large is U.S. participation in the fight 
against drugs? 
  [Ishii] There are U.S. personnel in the country. They are 
deployed in the Upper Huallaga region. This support is in answer 
to bilateral agreements between the United States and Peru. 
  [EL PERUANO] Are there any suggestions for Peru and other 
countries to form a common strategy at the world or hemispheric 
level within the new guidelines established by the United States 
to fight drug trafficking? 
  [Ishii] The Peruvian Government has a defined position 
regarding the fight on drugs because it is a problem affecting 
all countries, consumers and producers alike, one way or 
another. This means that we must form a common strategy to fight 
drug trafficking. 
  [EL PERUANO] How much did the CTI receive during 1993? How 
much does it expect to receive during 1994? 
  [Ishii] During 1993 the CTI received nearly $400 million. 
This year we expect to receive approximately $500 million.

<F P=106> [DESCO SPECIAL REPORT No. 31: "Political Violence in Peru </F>
Today," issued by Peru's Center for Development Studies and 
Promotion (DESCO)] 
  [Text] November has seen less political violence than 
almost any other time during the 13 years of war. During this 
month, there were 36 subversive actions, resulting in 42 deaths: 
six military personnel, one police officer, 11 civilians, and 18 
alleged subversives [as published]. 
  In a way, it was predictable that Shining Path [SL], 
especially, would pull back in November, after launching a 
larger number of actions for two months in a row in September 
and October. 
  This month's actions occurred primarily in Lima, which is 
still in first place with 20 attacks (56 percent). SL focused 
most of its bombings on private businesses. There were three car 
bombings during the month, two of them in commercial areas in 
Miraflores and Camacho, while the third one went off near an 
Army barracks. 
  The second-largest number of assaults took place in the 
jungle region, with eight actions (22 percent). In the province 
of Leoncio Prado, there were six clashes, two of them open 
confrontations between subversives and security forces. The 
other four battles arose out of countersubversion actions by the 
Army. And in Leoncio Prado and Huanuco, subversives carried out 
annihilation attacks against civilians. 
  The central region was in third place out of four, with five 
assaults (14 percent). Two of these actions were successive 
confrontations involving the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement 
(MRTA) and the Army in Chanchamayo Province. The other two were 
SL bombings in Huancayo Province. 
  Last place in terms of subversive actions was taken by the 
northern region, with three assaults (8 percent). Two of the 
incidents involved the MRTA; in one they jammed the radios of 
the Chimbote National Police and in the other they rescued two 
of their members as they left the Chimbote courthouse. 
<H5>  Terrorist Attacks by Region: November </H5>

  -  1. Lima 56% 
  -  2. Jungle 22% 
  -  3. Central 14% 
  -  4. Northern 
8% 

    As for the number of casualties, the central region occupied 
first place with 24 (57 percent). All were members of the MRTA, 
killed in clashes with Army troops in the province of 
Chanchamayo. 
  In second place was the jungle region, with 14 casualties 
(33 
percent). Six were Army soldiers who died in two battles with SL 
in Leoncio Prado Province. In addition, eight civilians were 
killed in SL incursions in the provinces of Huanuco and Leoncio 
Prado. 
  In third and last place were the northern and Lima regions, 
which tied at two deaths (5 percent) each. In the northern 
region, an incursion by Shining Path in the village of 
Huayllapampa in Recuay Province resulted in the death of a 
lieutenant governor and a teacher. 
  In Lima, a petty officer in the National Police was gunned 
down from a car in the Cercado district, and a woman was killed 
when an explosive device went off in a bank office in San Juan 
de Lurigancho. 
<H5>  Victims by Region: November 1993 </H5>

  -  1. Central 57% 
  -  2. Jungle 33% 
  -  3. Lima 5% 
  -  4. Northern 
5% 

    There were no subversive actions in the principal region. 
The 
National Police exhibited 10 alleged members of SL in Huamanga 
and another nine in Huancavelica. 
  Finally, in the mid-northern region, another eight alleged 
SL's were exhibited.

  [Text] Thousands of employees of the Public Works Ministry 
decreed a work stoppage on Wednesday to demand payment of 
salaries and overtime. At least 15,000 public works employees 
throughout the country participated in the stoppage to demand 
payment of salaries and overtime, as well as a reclassification 
of personnel based on an agreement reached last year. 
  Salvador Acuna, secretary general of the ATMOP [Public Works 
Ministry Workers Association], said other public works 
departments will join the stoppage if the demands are not met. 
  [Begin Acuna recording] For the time being we can count on 
15,000 employees honoring the stoppage. We can add new workers 
every day with the new departments that have joined us. The Air 
Transportation Directorate could join us tomorrow, because we 
have ATMOP directorate board members there. The same goes for 
the National Land Transportation Directorate, which will join 
the stoppage today, and the Maritime Transportation Directorate, 
which could join on Friday. We do not want to inflict major 
damage, but our demands must be met or we will continue the 
stoppage indefinitely. [end recording] 
  We have reports from all over the country that employees of 
public works' branches in all department capitals will implement 
the measure to support the demands.

<F P=106> [Inaugural speech by Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina </F>
at the National Stadium in Tegucigalpa--live] 
  [Text] Mr. President of the sovereign National Congress and 
Messrs. Deputies; Mr. President of the Honorable Supreme Court 
of Justice and Messrs. Magistrates; Your Excellencies heads of 
state and government and Vice Presidents; Your Excellencies and 
honorable heads of special missions; national, civilian, and 
military authorities; Mr. Archbishop of Tegucigalpa and bishop 
of Honduras; Messrs. Representatives of the country's organized 
groups; special guests; Messrs. Representatives of the local and 
foreign media; Honduran people: [shouts, applause] 
  This prelude to the third millennium is a unique time in 
man's history; it is his time of freedom, freedom before nature, 
because a formidable breakthrough in the development of science 
has unleashed a spiral of technological miracles that constantly 
revolutionize our methods of production, life, and thought; 
freedom so that every nation may seek a better future, because 
not only have the markets reached world proportions, but, above 
all, hopes have reached world proportions; freedom for every man 
and woman to seek their own destiny, because all of the old 
dogmas have capsized, and the irrepressible tide of freedom has 
defeated totalitarianism and authoritarianism throughout the 
world. 
  To state it is a time of freedom is tantamount to saying it 
is time for great moral decisions; hence, at this very moment 
mankind has again chosen between civilization and barbarism, 
between a rational dialogue, as in Central America, the Middle 
East, and South Africa, and the demential option of a new age of 
violence, as in Bosnia, Somalia, and Georgia; between the 
suicide of continuing to extinguish and poison our planet and 
the clear awareness that either we all survive or no one 
survives; between the myopic lack of solidarity among nations, 
such as the myopic decision to drown poor countries with the 
burden of foreign debt, or to deny them access to the markets of 
the rich countries, and the lucidity [applause, shouts] the 
lucidity [repeats himself] of knowing that the poor people of 
the world will respect no borders pretty soon; between the 
rarefied air of the government's corruption and the fresh breeze 
resulting from the moral anger of a citizenry that is ousting, 
in one country after another, ministers, heads of state, and 
political regimes. [shouts, applause] 
  It is time for man's freedom, time for great moral options. 
That is why the moral revolution begins today in Honduras for 
all our people! [applause, cheers; crowd chants "Reina! Reina! 
Reina!"] Ladies and gentlemen, the moral revolution is much 
more than a campaign slogan. It is the foundation and keystone 
for building a new Honduras. The moral revolution means values 
will again be more important than interests and that the 
people's desires will always prevail over personal interests. 
The moral revolution means that Honduras is declaring itself of 
legal age, and its people have chosen to play a leading rather 
than a supporting role in their own history. The 
majority--underprivileged until yesterday--has decided to take 
control of their destiny. [cheers, applause] 
  The moral revolution is a daily, constant effort that should 
be exerted not only at the government level but also in all of 
the actions of our public and private life. The moral 
revolution means all state officials--from the president to the 
most modest official--will dedicate their efforts to serving the 
people rather than using their position to get richer and 
helping their closest friends get richer. [shouts, cheers, 
applause] The moral revolution means Honduras will truly be a 
legal state, where the law is the only arbitrator of the 
people's actions and where the authorities are never able to 
abuse their power to violate citizens' rights. [shouts, 
applause, cheers] 
  The moral revolution means placing once again the Honduran 
woman and man in a prominent position. It means recovering our 
fellow citizens' personal values and self-esteem. It means all 
the authorities' actions will be at the service of human 
development, and that our country's riches and potential are 
based on the talent, tenacity, and honesty of its people rather 
than in the abundance of its natural resources. It means 
recognizing that Honduras is not so much a poor country but a 
country that has been poorly managed. It means [cheers, shouts] 
in sum, we are not interested in economic development per se. 
We are interested in the development of our people, by our 
people, and for our people. [cheers, applause] 
  Ladies and gentlemen, the moral revolution means a new pact 
between the Honduran people and their government, a pact to 
rationalize the size of its administration and simplify its 
procedures to have honesty instead of corruption, encouragements 
instead of obstacles to private initiative. [cheers] We will not 
continue to confuse the state with bureaucracy. Above all, the 
state will be the expression and guarantee that Honduras has a 
national unity. Honduras has a national identity, and Honduras 
has a national purpose. The state is the Honduran essence in 
action; it is the future about which we all have dreamed and the 
future we will all build. 
  Furthermore, the state is the sovereign rule of the law. 
Therefore, with the authority I have as a lifetime jurist and 
invariable democrat, today I assert before the world: There 
will be no more impunity for human rights violations in 
Honduras! [applause, shouts] 
  My government will not allow personal interests to prevail 
to benefit the upper class, nor will it allow discrimination to 
exclude the lower class. The state guarantees a free and just 
existence for each and everyone. It does not signify choosing 
between a neoliberalism without soul and interventionism without 
a future. It involves an effort to merge all the possible 
markets with all the state that is necessary. It signifies 
trying to respect and stimulate the free initiative of our 
businessmen and our workers, so that our agriculture and 
industry will compete openly but on an equal and effective 
footing with the other nations. 
  It involves having the state, enterprise, and unions become 
partners in achieving a new place for Honduras, within the world 
economy. This was done by countries which, as the so-called 
Dragons of Asia, did not have more wealth than we do up until a 
few years ago. We will do so to defend our agriculture up to 
the phase of processing and commercialization, where the largest 
part of the aggregate value is generated. We will do so, to 
diversify farming and artisan exports, to reconvert industry or 
to consolidate ecotourism. It means, above all, an effort to 
progress from formal democracy to real democracy. Hondurans 
will not only be equal before the law but equal in life, to 
break that infamous encirclement in which hunger, poor health, 
and ignorance have so many of our fellow citizens trapped 
[applause] so that we may look into the eyes of our children and 
tell them there is an opportunity for everybody on earth. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, I have never been a salesman of 
dreams. 
I am not unaware of the tenacity, complexity, or the extent of 
the problems of our Honduras, nor have I been a collector of 
recriminations. The people already had their say in the 
administration of my distinguished predecessor, whom I warmly 
embrace on this symbolic day of our republican life. [applause] 
  The people know how difficult the economic, social, 
financial, and foreign exchange problems the new administration 
will have to face. I did not promise rivers of milk and honey. 
I offered to change the shamed face of our fatherland. I 
offered the dignified austerity of a government that will work 
with as much tenacity and honesty as do the peoples of the 
Republic of Honduras. [applause] 
  I promised not to take into consideration how state 
decisions would affect or not affect my personal interests and 
those of my relatives and friends. I promised to govern for all 
Honduras, and I will govern for all Honduras. [applause] It is 
the only thing I can do after being in love for such a long 
time, always in love with my Honduras, my fatherland. 
  I give you my word of honor before God, the people and 
history that I will succeed in the plan that I have undertaken. 
I am going to defeat corruption in Honduras. [applause, cheers] 
I am going to implement social liberalism. I am going to carry 
out a moral revolution for all our people. 
  I pledged to do this and the time has come to begin 
fulfilling my solemn promises to the people. The administration 
of all properties I own will be crystal clear. The president of 
the Republic will not be directly or indirectly involved in 
private businesses or companies. [applause, cheers] 
  The members of my government cabinet must present sworn 
statements of their current assets and liabilities, and they 
will refrain from conducting business deals with any state 
institutions. [applause] In the next few hours I will appoint a 
special auditor for each public institution. [applause] I will 
end the confidentiality with which certain budget entries have 
been handled for some time. [applause, cheers] I will impart 
precise instructions to the state's comptrolling and inspection 
bodies. I will not hesitate to report any attempt to shelter 
the corrupt with the blanket of impunity. [applause, cheers] I 
will send to Congress a bill for a code of ethics for government 
employees. 
  I have nominated individuals of undisputed moral integrity, 
as well as of the highest intellectual qualifications and the 
most recognized professional backgrounds, for the Supreme Court 
of Justice. 
  I will convoke the Higher Council of Economic Planning to 
begin the great process of national dialogue. 
  We will immediately and drastically begin cutting all 
superfluous spending by the Honduran state. [applause] 
  With the patriotic participation of the Armed Forces, we 
will 
define its role in the new scenario of peace, democracy, and 
development. I respectfully greet the chief of the Armed Forces 
of the Republic of Honduras. [applause] 
  We have already initiated the dialogue with multilateral 
credit organizations to clear the horizon in matters pertaining 
to currency exchange and to prevent the need to service the debt 
from suffocating urgent social problems. Under the personal 
direction of the president of the Republic, ministers for 
economic and social issues will form a special council with new 
methods to coordinate social and economic issues into a single 
policy. 
  We will increase social spending until we bring it to 35 
percent of the state's budget. [applause] The savings derived 
from the austerity program and the cuts in superfluous spending, 
as well as the funds received from international cooperation, 
will be earmarked for priority programs of human development, 
food security, basic health, basic education, productive 
employment, and housing. 
  Distinguished delegations from friendly countries and 
international organizations, you are cordially welcome in this 
land of liberty and tolerance called Honduras. [applause] It is 
true that in the struggle that brought mourning to our neighbors 
during that suicidial decade of the Cold War, Hondurans were 
forced to assume leading roles that we did not seek and did not 
want. But the wounds from that episode have already healed. 
Democrats throughout the world have a fatherland here in 
Honduras. I hope that Hondurans will continue to count on 
international solidarity to make this fatherland a pillar of 
democracy and development. 
  Once more we can walk together with our Central American 
friends to consolidate our democratic accomplishments, to 
eliminate extreme poverty, to foster the economies, to protect 
the environment, and to adopt an emergency program that avoids 
any setback for the peace for which we worked so hard. We can 
now walk together to deepen economic, political, and social 
integration with greater participation by civilian society and a 
better articulation of regional institutions. 
  We can be present for the processes of continental 
integration and inter-American forums and those of the 
international community without being haunted by the specter of 
old suspicions. Honduras has chosen to be genuinely free, 
socially just, and politically sovereign. Honduras has chosen 
to come of age. 
  Fellow countrymen: Today we bid paternalism farewell. The 
tasks ahead are too beautiful for any Honduran to renounce the 
adventure of participating in their implementation. These tasks 
are too great for the shoulders of Carlos Roberto Reina alone. 
They are too great for a government team. These are tasks that 
can have but one size, the enormous size of Honduras, a Honduras 
that will keep its appointment with destiny and at long last 
cease to be the hesitant and uncertain fatherland that used to 
pain Francisco Morazan so deeply. [cheers] 
  That is the reason for the great national agreement I 
proposed as a candidate and that I begin to promote today as the 
president of all Hondurans. [cheers, applause] Being a Liberal 
is a way, my own way of loving Honduras, but there are other 
ways to love it. There is the Nationalist way, and there are 
other ways of expressing the same love for the fatherland. Let 
us work together, said a wiseman in ancient China on the 
threshold of the first millenium. A people that remains 
together for year will be strong for five years. A people that 
remains together for five years will be strong for a century. 
But a people that remains united for a century will be strong 
forever! That is the new Honduras I am proposing in this solemn 
ceremony. [applause] 
  Honduran brothers, let us begin now, with God as our 
witness. 
Let us begin! Good health to you, Honduran brothers. Good 
health to you, visitors to Honduras. [applause]

<F P=106> [Report by J.C.] </F>
  [Text] Although a code of ethics, which every member of the 
next government will be asked to sign, has not yet been drafted, 
President-elect Carlos Roberto Reina announced the names of his 
cabinet members yesterday and confirmed that two ministries will 
be occupied by members of the National Party of Honduras [PNH]. 
  It became clear that the new public administration is 
willing 
to implement a moral revolution and that crimes will not go 
unpunished, and thus, many people could be investigated after 
the current government completes its term. 
  President Reina presented seven ministers in the company of 
National Congress President Carlos Flores, former President Jose 
Azcona, and banker Jorge Bueso Arias. 
  The new cabinet consists of Efrain Moncada Silvia, 
government 
and justice minister; General Reynaldo Andino Flores, national 
defense and public security minister; Cecilio Zavala Mendez, 
labor and social welfare minister; Zenobia Rodas de Leon Gomez, 
public education minister; German Aparicio, communications and 
public works minister; and Rodolfo Pastor Fasquelle, culture and 
tourism minister. Reina announced that PNH member Carlos 
Medina, minister of the recently created Environment Ministry, 
will stay in that post. 
  The president also announced the following will serve as 
ministers without portfolio: Guillermo Bueso as coordinator of 
the economic cabinet; Dante Ramirez as coordinator of Central 
American integration issues; and Jorge Bueso Arias as 
coordinator of advisory issues. 
  To complete his team, Reina confirmed the following 
nominees: 
Ernesto Paz Aguilar, foreign minister; Delmer Urbizo Panting, 
economy and commerce minister; Juan Ferrera, finance and public 
credit minister; Guillermo Molina Chocano, coordination, budget, 
and planning (Secplan) minister; Enrique Samayoa, public health 
minister; and Ramon Villeda Bermudez, natural resources minister. 
  As for the decentralized institutions, he only presented 
Ubodoro Arriaga Ireheta, Hugo Noe Pino, who was ratified as 
president of the Central Bank of Honduras (BCH), and Lucio 
Izaguirre, as his private secretary. [sentence as published] 
<H5>  The Day Is Not Far Away </H5>
  Reina said he fulfilled his promise to establish an 
integration government by appointing Juan Ferrera as finance 
minister and Carlos Medina as environment minister. The two are 
PNH members. 
  When asked about the nomination of Andino Flores as defense 
minister, the president said that in the future a civilian will 
occupy that post, "and I have already discussed this with the 
Army High Command, which will soon be under my leadership as 
commander of the Armed Forces." 
  "The day is not far away for the appointment of a civilian 
in 
that post," Reina said. 
  Two days before his installation, the president said other 
positions at decentralized institutions will be announced in due 
time. 
  Reina also explained that later on he will be providing 
details concerning the press minister and that there will be no 
presidency minister. These are the only two ministries that 
have not been presented. He explained that his brother, Mario 
Reina Idiaquez, will be in the Presidency Office, but he will 
not bear the title of presidency minister. 
  Reina said upon return from the United States that he has 
tried to spread the idea that America and the world are headed 
for a convergence and that the most important issue at the turn 
of the century will be the agenda shared throughout the 
continent by democrats. 
  Reina stressed the "huge responsibility" of fulfilling the 
campaign promise of a moral revolution, which will be faced by 
himself and the people who will join him in the new government. 
  Reina explained during a news conference that as 
president-elect, as the head of the Central Executive Council 
[Consejo Central Ejecutivo] and as a citizen, he had suggested 
the names of possible Supreme Court justices to the deputies, 
whose duty it is to elect that body. 
  Although he made it clear that he knows the deputies alone 
have the final word, he said: "I urge my friends to support 
these candidates. I presented the names to them at a meeting, 
and I cannot disclose them, because I do not want any 
interference regarding the respect the executive branch should 
maintain for the legislative and judicial branches." 
  "What I would never tolerate is a Supreme Court that does 
not 
meet the requirements for a moral revolution. I would never 
tolerate that," he said. 
  Concerning economic measures, Reina said he will stick to 
his 
decision against additional taxes, which, he said, is a decision 
only he can make and which must not be based on suggestions or 
outside pressures from anyone. Thus, he expects to maintain 
safe and sound his desire to carry out a moral revolution. 
  Reina confirmed that one of the problems with which his 
government must deal is the fact that the international 
organizations have declared the country ineligible for loans, 
but Hondurans "will face these difficulties united, with a 
united party and a united people." 
  Although flattering figures have been mentioned during 
Rafael 
Leonardo Callejas' government, Reina said "surprising figures 
are gradually emerging, but I have entrusted the economic 
cabinet to the best people I could find, and it is up to them 
and to all of us to deal with the crisis." 
  One of Reina's strongest campaign promises was the guarantee 
that he would combat corruption, which he said "would not be 
easy." In view of this, he has asked every Honduran to get a 
full understanding of the Ethics Code which will be published, 
"because if these challenges are not met, it will be impossible 
to help the people." 
  Reina added that he invited the former presidential 
precandidates to yesterday's meeting so that they could express 
their views regarding the resolution, although that is the 
president's duty. 
  Asked why he only appointed one woman to a key position, 
Reina said women will be appointed to other important posts and 
that proof of this is that there are many female mayors, 
although there will be no battle between the sexes. 
  A cabinet is not for four years, Reina said, and women may 
be 
appointed if any of the current nominees fail; therefore, there 
is not a shred of prejudice in the appointments.

<F P=106> [Speech by Honduran President Rafael Leonardo Callejas at </F>
the National Congress for the inauguration of the congressional 
period on 25 January -- live] 
  [Text] Engineer Carlos Roberto Flores Facusse, honorable 
president of the National Congress of the Republic; Orlando 
Rosendo Lozano Martinez, honorable president of the Supreme 
Court of Justice; General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, commander in 
chief of the Armed Forces of Honduras; Messrs. magistrates of 
the Supreme Court of Justice; ministers of State; presidential 
designates; Your Excellencies members of the Diplomatic Corps; 
Messrs. presidents, managers, and directors of autonomous 
institutions; honorable members of the Board of Directors of the 
sovereign National Congress; ladies and gentlemen; beloved 
countrymen: 
  Allow me to first state my most sincere congratulations to 
the women of Honduras, and especially those who are part of this 
legislative assembly today. [applause] 
  I come before this august hall for the last time, in 
accordance with the precepts established in the Constitution of 
the Republic, before the honorable representation of the people 
in my condition as constitutional president to render my report 
on my activities as ruler of Honduras. 
  In the next few hours, I will relinquish power over the 
nation to my legitimate successor, who was chosen by the people 
through the democratic system, which Hondurans have respected 
since 1980 -- free suffrage, whereby the will is reflected as 
the sovereign expression of the people. 
  As ruler, as an Honduran, I am pleased to hand over the 
power 
in a peaceful and tranquil atmosphere, which is the result of a 
harmonic policy we applied on all the national sectors, seeking 
concerted agreements to all the national problems to find the 
proper solutions which would allow us to create plans that would 
prove to be consequent with the Honduran reality. 
  Recently, in a ceremony in my honor, hosted by the previous 
assembly -- and I again acknowledge Rodolfo Irias Navas, former 
president of the Congress of the Republic -- I said: Ruling is 
not an easy task. Managing public businesses can be difficult as 
is satisfying the people's different aspirations because the 
nation's resources are not sufficient to fulfill everyone's 
desires, thereby making it necessary to establish priorities 
that serve as a framework to attain, mid- or long-term, the 
objectives aimed at benefiting the people. 
  In the government report I will give to the secretariat of 
the sovereign National Congress, you honorable deputies will 
find details of the work undertaken during the first trimester 
of 1990 and their effects, which really interest us as they 
contribute to the national development in all of its aspects. 
  I am pleased, and I say it honestly, to have placed Honduras 
on the promising path to a free economy, freeing us from the 
chains of paternalism and protectionism that hindered Hondurans' 
creativity, overburdened the State, and paralyzed particular 
initiatives for production and competition. 
  It was also an honor for my government to have made gigantic 
steps in modernizing the highway system, technology, expanding 
telecommunications, and making accessible the extraordinary 
world of computers to our children. They are now available in 
the schoolrooms of our beloved Honduras. 
  I can say with deep emotion and pride that I have laid a 
groundwork for the future, when new leaders and generations will 
expand on our efforts regarding environmental protection, human 
rights, which are respected now more than during any other time 
in our history, and Honduras' reconciliation through ideological 
tolerance, which we have established, and the initiatives that 
we have sponsored with the determination to deal seriously with 
corruption. 
  In the field of education, which I want to emphasize, we 
have 
built a number of primary school classrooms throughout the 
country. This reveals my government's firm support for 
education, because we have built schools for thousands of 
children who lacked school facilities in their communities; in 
addition, thousands of desks were donated through the Honduran 
Social Investment Fund. These desks have alleviated the 
discomfort of the many young Hondurans who had to sit on the 
floor. On handing over the administration, I can say that no 
child will have to be ashamed and sit on the hard floor. Our 
determination to stimulate education in Honduras is indicated by 
our help in refurbishing primary and secondary schools and 
constructing new centers, particularly trade schools, which give 
thousands of young people an opportunity to learn working skills 
to the benefit of the area in which they live. 
  In the health sector, hospitals were repaired, and hundreds 
of health centers were built during my administration. They 
were equipped with everything necessary to serve the people. In 
many instances, semidilapidated buildings were all that remained 
of previous administrations. People often despaired of never 
having an adequate place to which to go for treatment of their 
most pressing health needs. An organized health sector work 
structure will be handed over to the new government, which will 
assume office on 27 January. Diseases which have ravaged the 
child population were put under control. We have tackled the 
terrible cholera with determination via prevention drives, the 
speeding up of construction of latrines, and by making the 
people aware of the need to take sanitary measures to defeat the 
epidemics that crossed our border to obliterate the lives of 
hundreds of Hondurans. 
  In the social area we have sympathized with sectors that for 
a long time have been relegated or excluded as the result of 
neglect. For this reason, we have established a bonus for unwed 
mothers, an economic aid instrument to help them take care of 
the basic problems of their children, children whose extreme 
poverty has barred access to food and education. In addition, 
school bags and footwear were given out to the children of many 
schools in municipalities, villages, and hamlets via the family 
assistance program. My administration's relationship with rural 
and urban workers has been consistent with a policy of 
understanding, within the patriotic purpose of maintaining a 
climate of harmony, which translates into national well-being. 
  Fellow countrymen, ladies and gentlemen, deputies, before I 
hand over the presidential office, I would like to express my 
deep satisfaction over the fact that, with the cooperation of 
worthy and distinguished Hondurans and well-known international 
jurists, it fell on me to end the old territorial dispute with 
our neighbor, El Salvador. The century-old controversy, which 
weighed down on the two countries like a dissociating factor of 
the regional peace, ended with a fair ruling, which confirmed 
our sovereign rights on the sacred national territory. I will 
keep this achievement, which we Hondurans share proudly, as a 
reminder of what we can do when we join forces. At all times, 
and regardless of political inclinations, we contributed as 
Hondurans to a common cause, which in time had alienated us from 
the unionist principles envisioned by the immortal hero of La 
Trinidad. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, deputies, today, during my last 
official intervention as Honduran president and in the presence 
of a new Congress elected by the people, I would like to 
recognize the entire nation, because we have demonstrated again 
our people's political maturity and deep-rooted reliance on 
democracy. I am leaving my performance as president printed on 
history's pages so that what I wanted to do for my homeland can 
be assessed in the future. To point out achievements or 
mistakes should not be the part of sectarian inclinations, 
rather, of a position that will make it possible to review in 
the future what we did to reinforce Honduras preserving its name 
and prestige as a result of our democratic training. 
  History is wise, because when Marco Aurelio Soto decided to 
reform Honduras, the critics of his time shot poisoned arrows at 
his honorable person, not realizing that those changes would 
allow us to begin a new century of hope. Such was the case of 
late illustrious President Juan Manuel Galvez who founded the 
national banking system, modernized education, allowed all 
Hondurans to participate in the matters of state, and spoke on 
behalf of free expression in every possible way. History was 
also late in recognizing the social contribution of Jose Ramon 
Villeda Morales, another illustrious Honduran who [applause] as 
president gave the people social security, labor law, and land 
reform. 
  Deputies, with devotion for Honduras I would like to say 
that, in setting aside by political feelings, I feel proud to 
reach such a significant moment in my public life, when I can 
pass on the presidential sash in an atmosphere of peace and 
harmony to the citizen who captured the people's approval, Mr. 
Carlos Roberto Reina. [applause] 
  Honorable representatives of the people, my mission as the 
leader of Honduras' destiny is about to conclude. I encourage 
you to make a united supreme effort, from your high posts, as 
vested upon you by the people and only by the people, to 
continue living in democracy, maintaining the highest national 
interest first and foremost. I thank you one and all, and I 
especially thank the Honduran people for the highest honor ever 
granted to my family, my wife Norma, and myself, of serving this 
beloved country, Honduras. Thank you.

  [Text] Managua, 27 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- The Nicaraguan 
Government today deemed it has concluded all negotiations with 
transportation organizations on the topic of fuel prices -- the 
main reason behind a strike that has halted nearly all passenger 
and freight service. 
  Meanwhile, five of these organizations issued an ultimatum 
that negotiations should resume today by 1800 local (1200 GMT) 
[times as received] after the dialogue reached an impasse on 
Wednesday night. 
  In a communique, the organizations called on their "allied 
forces" in seaports and at the international airport in this 
capital to join the strike to support the protest staged by 
members of the transportation sector over the past four days. 
  The Federation of Nicaraguan Passenger Carriers 
(Fetracolnic), the Federation of Nicaraguan Cargo Carriers 
(Fetracanic), the Nicaraguan Transportation Council, the 
National Transportation Commission (CNT), and the National 
Transportation Association (Anatra) signed the communique. The 
communique, which was read by a transportation sector leader 
over a local radio station, warned the transportation unions 
would paralyze all traffic nationwide, as well as international 
freight transportation, if a satisfactory agreement is not 
reached tonight. 
  Meanwhile, Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo reiterated the 
government's decision to continue talking with all groups on 
strike. The official ruled out a bilateral meeting with the CNT, 
the organization that promoted the strike which began at 0000 
local on 24 January. 
  "We will meet with everyone, not just with one group," 
Lacayo 
said in a meeting with journalists in front of the National 
Assembly building. 
  The members of the transportation sector called on the 
Catholic Church to ask the Nicaraguan Government to lay aside 
its "hard-line" position on fuel prices in an effort to resolve 
the costly crisis. 
  Construction and Transportation Minister Pablo Vigil, in 
statements to LA PRENSA newspaper, ruled out the possibility of 
negotiating fuel prices after the government released a 
communique on Tuesday night, in which it announced the freezing 
of gasoline prices, a slight decrease in diesel prices, and a 
subsidy for the freight and passenger transportation sector. 
Nevertheless, this moved failed to meet the strikers' demands. 
  In related news, the National Police have released 61 of 277 
people who were arrested on Wednesday and Thursday during 
operations conducted along the Northern Highway and in Ciudad 
Sandino in Managua, according to CNT sources.

<F P=106> [From the "This Morning" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta Artola has 
confirmed that during the disturbances early 26 January on the 
northern highway and in other areas of the capital, 206 people, 
who will be placed under the disposal of common courts, were 
arrested for disrupting public order and committing other crimes 
as identified in the current Penal Code. He also said several 
minors who were arrested as they attempted to remove 
cobblestones from the streets were released later. 
  Mendieta Artola has explained that no disturbances will be 
tolerated, adding that police authorities will act in accordance 
with the law. 
  [Begin recording] [Mendieta] The National Police has 
sustained some attacks. Later, a cleanup operation during the 
predawn hours of 26 January, starting at 0500, resulted in 220 
people being arrested; of these, we have released those who are 
minors and we are still holding 206 individuals in prison, 
individuals who have been placed under the disposal of 
authorities; they are now being processed by authorities. 
  In this regard, the gentlemen of the National Transportation 
Commission [CNT] have called for a meeting to discuss the 
release of these people. We have met with CNT representatives 
and they demanded the release of these people, but they did not 
make any commitments that would permit us to guarantee the fact 
that these people may indeed be waging a civic and peaceful 
strike. 
  We noted the need for CNT representatives and the Government 
Ministry to sign a commitment ensuring they would only conduct 
peaceful actions. This was not possible, because they refused 
to sign this document. Later, when we learned of the National 
Assembly document, we discussed it with CNT representatives and 
explained that the solution to the transportation problem lied, 
as the National Assembly Manifesto stated, in the possibility of 
meeting with all transportation sectors. 
  In this regard, we also noted the need for the CNT leaders 
to 
display a more serious attitude, because they have given false 
statements to the media. The statements by CNT representatives 
are aimed at promoting an atmosphere of violence at this time. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What is the juridical and legal 
situation of the 200 people who were arrested? Are they all 
members of the transportation sector? 
  [Mendieta] Yes. Those who were arrested have violated 
constitutional articles, particularly Article 31, which 
establishes the right of all Nicaraguans to transit freely 
throughout the nation. They have also violated Article 325 of 
the Penal Code, which says that those individuals who damage or 
destroy communication roadways and who may endanger the security 
of transportation vehicles commit an offense. They have also 
violated Article 346 of the Penal Code, which establishes that 
those who attack authorities are subject to imprisonment ranging 
from one to three years. [end recording]

newscast] 
  [Text] The focus of conversations held this afternoon 
between the Colombian and Panamanian presidents was bilateral 
ties. 
  Today, Colombian President Cesar Gaviria made a technical 
stopover at the National Air Service terminal in Tocumen, during 
which he met with his Panamanian counterpart Guillermo Endara. 
Cesar Gaviria declared his meeting with Endara at the airport 
had nothing to do with his possible participation in the bid for 
the post of OAS secretary general, nor was it intended to 
pressure the Endara government to support him. 
  [Begin Gaviria recording] We are working on all fronts. We 
want to have better control of our borders, but we are also 
working on commercial aspects. The Grancolombiana Merchant Fleet 
is working on an interesting project to begin ferry 
transportation on a daily basis between Cartagena, Colon, and 
Panama City. This is a very interesting project that for the 
time being will resolve the Darien gap problem and will allow us 
to have permanent transit not only between Panama and Colombia, 
but also between Central and South America. [end recording] 
  Gaviria stressed he came to strengthen bilateral ties. He 
then left the National Air Service terminal in Tocumen to attend 
the inauguration of new Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina. 
  Meanwhile, Panamanian President Guillermo Endara called his 
brief meeting with Gaviria as positive. He also explained that 
his decision to not attend the inauguration of the new president 
of Honduras was because he prefers to stay in the country to 
think about possible changes he will make in his government 
cabinet.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Chile monitored through 27 
January. Source is listed in parentheses following each item: 
  The U.S. company CDE Chilean Mining Corporation, a 
subsidiary 
of Coeur d'Alene Mines, signed a contract with the Chilean 
Government for the investment of $52 million in a project to tap 
gold and silver deposits in Fachinal, a village in the 11th 
Region. Commercial production is expected to begin during the 
first half of 1995. It is estimated that daily production will 
be 1,500 metric tons. (Santiago ESTRATEGIA in Spanish 13 Jan 94 
p 6) 
  The National State Railroad Company announced that it will 
put its freight subsidiary up for bids. Ignacio Echavarria, 
chairman of the National State Railroad Company, explained that 
the objective is to decentralize the national railroad system, 
improve its facilities, and expedite operations. The subsidiary 
was created in 1993 to handle freight in central and southern 
Chile. Echavarria stated that both Chilean and foreign 
investors will be able to bid for 51 percent of the subsidiary's 
shares, adding that this is the first and probably the only 
privatization of a sound and operational company that will be 
carried out under the current administration. The bidding terms 
will be available on 31 January. (Santiago Radio Cooperativa 
Network in Spanish 1000 GMT 22 Jan 94)

  [Text] Medellin, Colombia, 26 Jan (AFP) -- A poll conducted 
for the morning paper EL COLOMBIANO of Medellin and the private 
Caracol radio station today revealed that a large segment of the 
Colombian population mistrusts the presence of some 150 U.S. 
soldiers along Colombia's Pacific coastline. 
  The poll, which was conducted by the National Advisory 
Center 
[Centro Nacional de Consultoria -- CNC] in Medellin, the second 
largest city in the country, invited opinions on the presence of 
U.S. soldiers in Colombia. 
  It showed that 73 percent of those polled flatly rejected 
the 
foreign presence, 18 percent favored it, and 9 percent did not 
reply. 
  The rejection emerged in late December when a contingent of 
U.S. Marines arrived in the Pacific region to carry out charity 
works, according to the government's official report. According 
to the report, these foreigners are building a school, a health 
center, and a stretch of a road. Their arrival, however, 
sparked very angry comments, and several politicians even 
dismissed their tasks, claiming that Colombian soldiers could 
carry them out without foreign aid. 
  EL COLOMBIANO reported that those polled pointed out that 
"they do not accept the presence of U.S. Marines along the 
Colombian coast. Likewise, they mistrust the government's 
explanations about the works that are being carried out there." 
  When asked whether the presence of U.S. soldiers violates 
sovereignty, 69 percent replied yes, 20 percent replied no, and 
11 percent replied they did not know. When asked whether they 
believe the soldiers are building schools and roads, 66 percent 
of those polled replied no, 10 percent replied yes, and 24 
percent did not answer.

<F P=106> [Video report by Miriam Ortiz in the Uraba region; from the </F>
"24 Hours" newscast -- passages within quotation marks recorded] 
  [Text] The truth is that no one knows who committed the 
dozens of slayings that have brought mourning to the Uraba 
region. Some believe political groups confronting one another 
in an internal power struggle are responsible. Others believe 
it is the guerrillas, while others blame paramilitary groups. 
Each and every one of these parties, however, has washed its 
hands of the affair. 
  Following the massacre of 34 Hope, Peace, and Liberty -- EPL 
-- militants in Apartado in the Uraba region, the authorities 
directly accused the rebels of committing the crime. 
  [Army Commander General Hernan Jose Guzman, identified by 
caption] "The National Guerrilla Coordinating Board [CNG], and 
specifically the 5th Front of the FARC [Revolutionary Armed 
Forces of Colombia] and its Bolivarian Militias, are the ones 
that are instigating bloodshed in Uraba." 
  Meanwhile, the different political forces struggling for 
power in the region, aside from accusing one another, denounce 
the presence of paramilitary groups. The CNG, via a communique, 
has blamed the National Army and the paramilitary led by Fidel 
Castano for the events that have taken place in the Uraba 
region. Spokesmen for the Socialist Renewal Movement [CRS] 
assert the same. 
  [CRS spokesman Luis Alberto Cabeza, identified by caption] 
"The violent situation is being created from all sides. Not 
only -- as the media has reported -- are insurgents involved, 
but also the paramilitary groups, as well as the Army itself." 
  On the other hand, EPL reinsertados [guerrillas reintroduced 
into civilian life] believe those responsible for the violence 
unleashed in the Uraba region are members of the Patriotic Union 
[UP] and the Communist Party of Colombia, who -- according to 
the EPL reinsertados -- are bidding to maintain political 
hegemony over the region, no matter how high the cost. 
  [EPL spokesman Alvaro Caceres, identified by caption] "At 
this moment, the four mayors of the Uraba region in Antioquia 
Department -- Apartado, Chigorodo, Carepa, and Turbo -- are UP 
members who refuse to guarantee free elections in the Uraba 
region of Antioquia Department." 
  The UP, however, says this charge lacks political logic. UP 
representatives content paramilitary groups are responsible for 
the killings, and they question the Army's mission in the Uraba 
region. They assert that as more soldiers arrive, massacres will 
increase and impunity will abound.

  [Text] A FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] 
front blamed for killing 35 people in Apartado over the weekend 
has denied its participation in the massacre by claiming the 
culprits are the same people responsible for the killings at 
Honduras, La Negra, and Pueblo Bello haciendas. 
  Today, the Hope, Peace, and Liberty Movement said it will 
not 
withdraw from the Uraba political pact. The movement's topmost 
leader, Senator Anibal Palacios, however, has said that FARC's 
Bolivarian Militias are the ones that massacred 35 people in La 
Chinita, Apartado, neighborhood. This is Palacios' reaction to a 
letter FARC addressed to Antioquia Governor Juan Gomez Martinez 
denying FARC participation in the massacre. 
  [Begin Gomez Martinez recording] We did not say that 
Patriotic Unity is responsible, but rather that the Guerrilla 
Coordinating Board and the Bolivarian Militias had a hand in the 
La Chinita massacre. [end recording] 
  This afternoon, the movement leaders met with Government 
Minister Fabio Villegas Ramirez, whom they have asked to be an 
international observer for Uraba. 
  [Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish on 26 January 
publishes a 400-word article on page 6-A reporting: "The Hope, 
Peace, and Liberty Movement's decision to withdraw from the 
follow-up table [mesa de seguimiento], which guarantees the 
existence of the political pact signed in Uraba on 23 November, 
produced an avalanche of reactions." The article also reports: 
"Government Minister Fabio Villegas said the commitment has not 
been broken" and he adds that the Hope, Peace, and Liberty 
Movement still recognizes the validity of the political pact 
that was signed."]

<F P=106> [First paragraph is EL TIEMPO introduction] </F>
  [Text] According to the association's crystal ball, prices 
of state-provided goods and services continue to rise sharply. 
The same thing is happening with money in circulation, which is 
increasing by more than 35 percent. 
  Fenalco [National Federation of Businessmen] warned of the 
serious risk of a new heating up of inflation during the coming 
months as a consequence of the increase in the amount of money 
in circulation, the rates charged for services provided by the 
state, and the obligations imposed by the social security reform. 
  "Realistically, it seems likely that in 1994 the IPC 
[Consumer Price Index] will have a higher rate of increase 
because of a number of factors," said a Fenalco statement. 
  In its end-of-the-year report, Fenalco maintains that 
inflation's downward trend is still far from certain. "If foods 
are excluded, the annualized inflation rate remains at 27 
percent." 
  According to Fenalco, the prices of goods and services 
provided by the state continue to rise sharply. In addition, 
money in circulation is increasing by over 35 percent. 
  The business association also cites the fiscal deficit and 
the rise in public spending as causes of inflation, along with 
labor costs created by the social security reform, which 
readjusts the payments that businesses and users must make to 
the ISS [Social Security Institute]. 
  "Fenalco cannot be as optimistic about inflation in 1994 as 
the government is." 
<H5>  No Slowdown in Trade Liberalization </H5>
  Fenalco said that a too great delay of trade liberalization 
would be a historic error on the part of the next president of 
Colombia. This process has become essential for the nation's 
progress in the next century, if it wants to move ahead of the 
group of medium- and lower-income countries. 
  Another immediate challenge, says Fenalco, is stabilizing 
the 
economy to bring the annual inflation rate down to one-digit 
levels within a maximum of three or four years. 
  According to the business group, the next government cannot 
continue the policy of excessive, deficit-based public spending, 
nor can it slacken in the area of monetary discipline. 
  The report adds that accelerating devaluation to stimulate 
exports "is not a consistent and serious policy." 
  Concerning foreign investment in Colombia, Fenalco's 
president, Sabas Pretel de la Vega, said that although Pablo 
Escobar's death has created a better environment, Colombia still 
has many weaknesses and risks that deter foreign investment. 
  The association report includes numbers on business growth. 
According to these statistics, during the first eight months of 
1993 retail sales rose 3.8 percent. 
  Although automotive sales have increased, sales of imported 
vehicles declined during the last two months of 1993, as the 
dealers waited for next year's new models.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Antonio Urdinola: "Prospects for 1994"] </F>
  [Text] In 1993 Colombia's economy continued to behave much 
as it did in 1992. Growth was based on sectors not affected by 
international trade: construction, transportation, commerce, 
finance, and other public and private services. Sectors involved 
in international trade, essentially manufacturing and 
agriculture, are becoming less profitable as a result of the 
trade liberalization and revaluation of the last two years, plus 
the low international prices of basic commodities. 
  The economy is actually operating on two different tracks. 
Sectors not involved in international trade are growing at over 
five percent a year, with prices increasing at about 28 percent, 
and with high profits. Sectors involved in international trade, 
on the contrary, are growing much more slowly; prices are rising 
at less than 15 percent a year, while their average costs, 
especially wages, are rising more rapidly, driving profits down. 
  It seems rather unlikely that in 1994 the world economy will 
experience an expansion strong enough to significantly improve 
international prices of the basic commodities we export or that 
compete with our domestic production. So the only hope of 
slowing down the gradual deterioration of businesses affected by 
international trade lies in modifying the devaluation policy of 
the board of directors of the Bank of the Republic, and 
achieving more effective control of contraband and dumping. 
  Without such changes, the growth of the economy and jobs 
will 
remain dependent, as they are now, on a boom in construction and 
services, especially public services because of the surge in 
government spending. Personally, I do not believe in the 
long-term solidity of an economy where the vitality of its 
industry and agriculture is gradually decreasing. Construction, 
financed partly by foreign capital drawn by attractive dollar 
profits generated by revaluation, has demonstrated over and over 
its cyclical character, and it continues to do. Nor is it 
possible to indefinitely continue increasing public spending or 
the tax burden to finance this spending.

  [Text] Washington DC, 27 Jan, CANA -- The Organization of 
American States plans a special general assembly devoted to 
inter-American co-operation for development February 17-19 in 
Mexico. 
  Assistant Secretary General of the OAS, Christopher R. 
Thomas, said a major objective of the assembly "is to look at 
ways of boosting and promoting development in the context of 
consolidating democracy in the hemisphere". 
  Development, he added, "is at the core of the stability of 
democracy and progress of most of the countries of the 
hemisphere and so we must pay special attention to issues such 
as critical poverty which threatens stability and democracy". 
  According to Thomas, the special general assembly will also 
examine the mechanisms through which OAS technical assistance is 
provided so as to make such assistance more effective. 
  He said the assembly will consider a recommendation that two 
instruments within the OAS responsible for the provision of 
technical assistance - the Inter-American Council for Economic 
and Social Affairs and the Council for Education, Science and 
Cultural Affairs - be merged into a single council for integral 
development. 
  The establishment of a single council, he said, will provide 
for better coordination and serve to make OAS technical 
assistance more effective and efficient. 
  "I know there is some concern in the Caribbean that this new 
development because of the emphasis it places on the 
multilateral approach to providing technical assistance could 
result in a reduction of such asssistance to our Caribbean 
member-nations, but there is no tangible indication of this," he 
said. 
  Mexico's permanent representative to the OAS, Ambassador 
Alejandro Carrillo Castro, said the assembly was being convened 
"so that we can focus on the issue of critical poverty and take 
advantage of this new mechanism to ensure the best use for all 
of us of the resources at our disposal." 
  Canada's permanent representative to the OAS, Brian Dickson, 
chairs one of two sub-committees preparing for the special 
general assembly. 
  He said in an interview that the establishment of a single 
council for integral development within the OAS "will help to 
alleviate problems such as duplicaton and 
over-bureaucratization" which impede the effectiveness of 
technical asssitance. 
  "The OAS has made, we think, some very important efforts to 
reform and to adapt itself to the beginning of a new century and 
to respond to the new challenges which are before us. 
  "We believe that the efforts it is making in the area of 
technical assistance are very important in analyzing what the 
OAS is doing now, how it could do things better and how it could 
be more responsive to the needs of the hemisphere," Dixon said.

  [Excerpts] Nassau, Bahamas, 26 Jan, Cana -- Twenty per 
cent of shareholding in the state-owned Bank of Bahamas will be 
offered to the public later this year, Prime Minister Hubert 
Ingraham has announced. 
  He said the government's ownership of a commercial bank is 
against the policy of the ruling Free National Movement 
administration. 
  Ingraham, in a recent address to the Bankers Association of 
the Bahamas, also warned of the United States' efforts to try to 
"close down" and put pressure on international banking 
businesses in small countries. 
  He said the Bahamas must continue to maintain a good banking 
reputation so "we can look at them (United States) and say we 
are operating a clean banking system". 
  The Bahamas must also continue to be able to say that it 
does 
not facilitate drug trafficking and criminal money, and that the 
banks in the Bahamas have a code of conduct that is enforced, 
said Ingraham. 
  He said government will undertake a close examination of the 
banking sector to determine ways of improving its 
competitiveness. [passage omitted] 
  The Bank of the Bahamas, a 100 per cent government-owned 
entity, is being operated without government involvement in its 
management and is competing effectively in the private sector, 
he said. 
  Ingraham said government's continuing ownership of a 
commercial bank is consistent with its policy - leave business 
to business persons. 
  "Later in the year, we will begin the government's 
divestment 
programme by offering to the Bahamian public 20 per cent of the 
shares of the Bank of the Bahamas. 
  "The state's disengagement, however, will take due account 
of 
relevant factors including employment," said Ingraham. 
  The importance of the banking sector to the Bahamian economy 
is underscored by its estimated contribution to gross national 
product and employment opportunities. 
  In 1992, the banking industry employed almost 3 400 persons 
and had direct expenditure of almost 200 million dollars. 
  Ingraham said government was keen, not simply to maintain 
the 
Bahamas' position as the leader in the offshore banking 
community, but on regaining any of the ground lost to 
competitors. 
  As technology changes and as other financial centres improve 
their products and financial markets, the Bahamas will continue 
to improve efficiency and cost effectiveness in banking in the 
Bahamas, he said. 
  "We are making additional investment to ensure that we have 
the most sophisticated, state of the art telecommunications 
systems and that our regulatory framework remains appropriate to 
the business we are doing," said Ingraham. 
  As a result, the Bahamas is reviewing its telecommunication 
charges in comparision with other international financial 
centres so that it might ensure that it is technologically cost 
competitive and attractive to international business. 
  "The role played by human resource development in promoting 
the efficiency of our offshore centre, and in ensuring a more 
balanced distribution of economic and social progress cannot be 
over emphasised," Ingraham said. 
  "The government will place even greater emphasis on 
upgrading 
the skills of our work force through well defined training and 
retraining programmes which will take account of the dynamics of 
the marketplace," he said.

  [Text] A street demonstration is planned to support the 
resolutions of the popular congress. A rally is planned for 
today in Port-au-Prince to prompt the Haitian legislators to 
adopt the resolutions of the congress held in the National 
Theater from 18 to 20 January. The congress had asked for the 
formation of a consensus government to solve the crisis. Let us 
listen to a spokesman for the popular congress: 
  [Begin unidentified spokesman recording, in Creole] We are 
asking all citizens who are aware, as we are, of the seriousness 
of the situation to express solidarity with the Government of 
Public Security as an attempt to solve the crisis that we have 
been facing for too long. It is to undermine the bases of [word 
indistinct]. [end recording] 
  That was the assistant secretary general of the popular 
congress held on 18, 19 and 20 January by the Group of the Great 
North. 
  Another demonstration is due to be held this morning in 
Port-au-Prince in front of the parliament building to demand the 
lifting of the international sanctions and the embargo.

  [Text] A demonstration of support for the resolution of the 
popular congress held at the National Theater from 18 to 20 
January in Port-au-Prince, is being held today in front of the 
parliament. The delegates had decided, among other things, on 
the formation of a three-member government and demanded from 
parliament the ratification of the voted resolutions. 
  Today they are holding a demonstration in front of the 
Legislative Palace from which Rothschild Francois reports live: 
  [Francois] Indeed, the demonstrators are gathered before the 
Legislative Palace. They are severely criticizing the 
legislators -- deputies, and senators. They are demanding the 
dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies and of the Senate of the 
Republic. The demonstrators are also chanting words hostile to 
the embargo, to Aristide, and to the international community. 
  It should be noted that these demonstrators are not from 
Port-au-Prince, but from the Plateau Central and from the North. 
They came in response to a call by the Committee of Public 
Security, which is determined to install a new government in 
Haiti. So they came to Port-au-Prince this morning to 
demonstrate. Let us listen to Mobile 18, who met Leveille, in 
charge of the committee. 
  [Mobile 18] I am with Mr. Herve Leveille who is a member of 
the Group of the Great North and of the national congress. Mr. 
Leveille, did the mobilization begin today? 
  [Leveille] The mobilization has begun. Only the Plateau 
Central is represented in this demonstration. The other 
delegations will arrive later. There is a problem on the 
northern road, so we might not have the delegation from the 
North. Thus Plateau Central, the West, the Southeast, and the 
South delegations are due to arrive during the week. I am taking 
this opportunity to invite all the people in Port-au-Prince and 
the people from Cap-Haitian living in Port-au-Prince to come 
demonstrate with us their total rejection of the embargo and to 
demand the immediate formation of the Government of Public 
Security. 
  [Mobile 18] Mr. Leveille, we notice that you have gone to 
great effort. We especially notice that you have used a state 
bus to carry the people. Is this not prohibited by law? 
  [Leveille] If it is only this state bus that is available in 
a faraway zone, where these demonstrators live, how could they 
not use it? It is normal. Here, you have more options. But with 
the embargo, there is almost no car running in the provinces. 
And you should, instead of dwelling on these minute details, 
note the effort behind bringing 500 people to the capital now. 
You should understand what that means, with fuel at $20 a gallon 
now. Even if a truck driver is willing to help us, his car gets 
worn out. It is normal to use what is at hand.

  [Text] In accordance with a Democratic Action [AD] National 
Executive Committee decision made during a Monday morning 
meeting, more than 2,000 members will be expelled from the party. 
  The expulsion will include members who supported other 
political organizations during the recent campaign and those who 
were candidates of political parties with which AD had no 
alliances. The National Executive Committee also appointed a 
commission to conduct a political analysis of the departments to 
prepare for the national convention. 
  As for the new government, AD Organization Secretary Lewis 
Perez reiterated that his party will support all things deemed 
positive for the country, even though National Convergence and 
Movement Toward Socialism voted against AD leader Carmelo Lauria 
in the Chamber of Deputies. 
  [Begin Perez recording] The AD will support any action or 
decision made by President Rafael Caldera that will benefit the 
country. We are going to remain critical of and follow closely 
the implementation of the government program proposed by Caldera 
during the recent campaign. [end recording] 
  It was also revealed that the National Executive Committee 
will hold a special meeting this week for members to review the 
country's fiscal and economic situation and establish a solid 
position on the measures to be implemented by Dr. Rafael Caldera.

  [Text] At the Miraflores Palace, Venezuelan Petroleum 
[Petroven] President Gustavo Roosen has said he is fairly 
optimistic about the achievements of the negotiations between 
Venezuela and the United States on measures restricting national 
fuels. 
  [Begin recording] [Pachano] Gustavo Roosen also said 
President-elect Rafael Caldera's team of advisers has advised 
him of Petroven's budget for next year and its guidelines. 
Roosen pointed out that he fully approves of the plans our main 
oil company will execute. 
  [Roosen] In fact, Caldera's adviser Julio Cesar Rodriguez 
attended the 30 December meeting, and we have met several times 
since that meeting. He fully approves of the budget guidelines. 
He also told me he approves of the 10-year plan, which 
encompasses all the objectives to significantly increase the 
supply of oil products. 
  In fact, as a multifaceted company, about 75 percent of our 
total sales, including cyclical sales, consist of oil products, 
and only 25 percent consist of crude oil sales. Since 1982, 
Petroven has been replacing crude oil exports for oil product 
exports in international markets. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Alonso Zambrano and Miguel Angel Liendo] </F>
  [Text] Maracaibo -- Manuel Finol, president of Maracaibo's 
Municipal Institute of Urban Collective Transportation 
[Instituto Municipal de Transporte Colectivo Urbano de Maracaibo 
-- IMTCUMA], conceded that despite his government's position, 
the drivers' strike in the capital municipality of Zulia State 
was a success, with its most obvious effects being the burning 
of 11 taxis and the high absentee rate. 
  No vehicles were available at the station. 
  Finol said the situation was due in part to a lack of police 
support from state authorities, because if the Mayoralty's buses 
had begun operating in the early morning hours, "we could have 
broken the transportation strike in the city." 
  However, Finol confirmed that seven routes were covered by 
Consolidated Transportation buses, which began offering their 
services after noon, and by 50 vans belonging to various 
municipal institutes. 
  Jose Sarmiento, president of the Single Transportation 
Workers' Union and representative of the Central-Western 
Transportation Association, who drove through the city in a 
brand-new private vehicle with a cellular phone to assess the 
strike, concluded that it was a success in 17 municipalities of 
Zulia State. Upon the conclusion of the transportation strike, 
Manuel Finol denounced the destruction of 11 vehicles on Aticos 
Avenue, south of the city. The vehicles belonged to the 
Maracaibo mayor's office. A driver identified as Alvin Pirela 
was injured in the incident, which prompted IMTCUMA to suspend 
its contingency plan for providing transportation to the 
population through special means. 
  Barquisimeto -- The Lara Drivers' Union decided to suspend 
mass transit to Lara and other cities in the remaining eight 
autonomous municipalities, thus forcing residents to cope with 
the situation in order to get to their homes, schools, and 
places of employment. 
  Driver's Union President Deputy Erik Zuleta said the measure 
was implemented in accordance with instructions issued by the 
Transportation Federation as an action against the 
Transportation and Communications Ministry for not resolving the 
proposals made by that organization in October 1993. The 
Transportation Federation made proposals regarding increases in 
urban and rural fares in the countryside and the effects of the 
half-fare paid by students, which drivers hope the government 
will cancel. 
  The measure, which proved wholly successful in paralyzing 
the 
transportation sector in 11 states on 25 January, was also to 
protest the implementation of the value-added tax, which the 
Transportation Federation believes should be definitively 
eliminated. 
  Hundreds of people formed long lines to wait hopelessly for 
buses. Meanwhile, the Mayoralty and the Council made desperate 
attempts to contact private vehicle owners to authorize them to 
cover the various routes. In addition, cooperation from the 
National Guard and Army was being demanded to get the buses out 
on the streets. The lack of transportation prevented workers 
and students from getting anywhere all day yesterday. 
  Merida -- The driver's union strike virtually paralyzed the 
principal cities in the Andean region yesterday despite efforts 
by the authorities to help people reach their various workplaces. 
  There were no reports of violent incidents.

attain higher levels of efficiency and productivity in the 
factory, and also proposed measures to confront the difficult 
economic situation in the nation.

  [Text] Pedro Ross Leal, member of the Politburo and 
secretary general of the Cuban Workers Federation [CTC], has 
stressed that the 55th anniversary of the CTC is a patriotic 
celebration which ought to contribute to consummate the workers' 
commitment to defend the Revolution and the accomplishments of 
socialism. Ross added that the unity of the labor movement 
anticipated by the founders of the CTC during the period of the 
pseudo-republic, inspires today's workers to confront the 
criminal U.S. blockade. Likewise, Ross pointed out that in this 
new anniversary of the CTC, Cuban workers are seeking new ways 
to attain higher economic efficiency and alternatives to 
streamline the national finances. 
  Pedro Ross also announced that the 55th CTC Anniversary pin 
will be given, for the first time, to 66 founder members and 
union leaders on 28 January in recognition of their work in the 
labor movement.

  [Text] Tomorrow, engrossed in the assembly process known as 
the workers parliament, the Cuban Workers Federation [CTC] 
celebrates its 55th anniversary. Reporter Jose Luis Rumbao 
discussed this topic with CTC Secretary General Pedro Ross. 
  [Begin recording] [Ross] At the moment, the efforts being 
made by Cuban workers are the highest expression of patriotism. 
We are in the trenches, where we should be, and without 
expecting immediate material benefits. To those workers, 
especially the women, who get up early in the morning to take 
their children to the infant circle by bicycle, then go to work, 
to return home later and employ magic in preparing the family's 
food -- to those workers we express our deepest recognition. 
  [Rumbao] The 55th anniversary of the CTC will be marked by 
the labor union assemblies known as the workers parliaments: an 
example of what the workers democracy can do when united to save 
the achievements of the Revolution. 
  [Ross] This is a great process. In fact, I can say that I am 
very satisfied with the assemblies I have attended. So far I 
have participated in ten assemblies since the process began. I 
believe they have all been the quintessence of what we expected. 
  [Rumbao] Ross pointed out that more than 3 million workers 
and 1 million retired workers have been invited for February and 
half of March to participate, with their ideas and actions, in 
the solution our parliament will establish during its next 
session.

  [Text] Tomorrow is the 55th anniversary of the founding of 
the Cuban Workers Federation [CTC], which falls on the 141st 
anniversary of the birth of Jose Marti. What an honor for the 
Cuban working class such a marvelous coincidence is, precisely 
when Marti's call to unity is being heard today more than ever 
in the hearts of Cubans. For that reason, this newscast 
broadcasts exclusively to Cuba's workers the greeting from CTC 
Secretary General Pedro Ross. 
  [Begin recording] To these workers, [repeats] to these 
workers who with such great interest, such a tremendous sense of 
responsibility, have taken up this process of the parliament in 
the workplace, we send our warmest greetings. This is what we 
are paying homage to on this 55th anniversary of the founding of 
the CTC. [end recording]

  [Text] New cases of hog cholera has been detected in the 
provinces of Pinar del Rio, La Havana, Havana City, and part of 
Matanzas. 
  As the first signs were detected a few months ago, the 
Veterinarian Institute warned about the dangers of transferring 
pigs or pork within those affected areas. This institute has 
also banned the unauthorized transfer of pigs from those 
provinces to the rest of the country. The control must be 
strengthened to quickly detect possible new cases and to 
facilitate the vaccination of pigs in each zone, municipality, 
or province, according to the planned program of priorities.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on 
Havana radio and television in Spanish between 24 and 26 
January. Source is listed in parentheses following each item: 
  Radio Reloj at 2040 GMT on 24 January reports that 
accelerated repairs are being made at the Republica Dominican 
Mill in Carlos Manuel de Cespedes municipality, Camaguey 
Province. Originally, the Rebublica Dominicana Mill was not 
scheduled to participate in the grinding in Camaguey this 
harvest. It was later decided that the mill would participate 
"because of the importance to the nation to produce as much 
sugar as possible." 
  Radio Reloj at 2042 GMT on 24 January notes that production 
in Matanzas Province has decreased. According to a statistical 
study, the province produced 777 million pesos' worth of goods 
in 1993, which was 71 percent of the amount that had been 
projected. "In comparison with a similar earlier period, 
Matanza's economy showed a decline of almost 21 points, felt 
most strongly in the sugar industry." 
  Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 25 January reports that 400 
caballerias of tobacco have been planted in Pinar del Rio. Some 
4,000 students are participating in the planting. 
  Radio Reloj Network at 2030 GMT on 25 January reports in its 
30-minute newscast that: 
  The plant at the Ignacio Agramonte Sugar Mill that produces 
the product called "sorbitol," a sugarcane by-product, produced 
over 300 tons of the product in 1993. "Sorbitol" is used in 
making toothpaste, diet foods, pharmaceuticals, and other 
things. The plant has the capacity to produce 10,000 tons a year 
in the Villa Clara and Camaguey plants. Also obtained were 217 
tons of glucose. 
  The local industries of Contramaestre municipality, Santiago 
de Cuba Province, brought in 5 million pesos for the state in 
1993. "Esteban Lazo, secretary general of the Communist Party of 
Cuba for the province, urged local industries to improve quality 
and design, and to increase prodcution of certain very important 
products, such as shoes for school children, workers, and the 
population in general." 
  "Over 13 million passengers were transported within Matanzas 
in 1993 thanks to the efforts of the state inspectors, who also 
created a favorable atmosphere for moving some 1,000 metric tons 
of various types of merchandise. During that period, the more 
than 230 men and women commonly known as `yellows' [because of 
the color of their uniforms] collected slightly more than 1 
million pesos and made use of over 1 million vehicles belonging 
to enterprises and organizations." They were assisted by around 
70 volunteers. 
  There have been 42 Basic Cooperative Production Units 
[UBPC's] formed in Havana Province to-date: 29 in miscellaneous 
crops; 10 in tobacco, and 3 in citrus. Four remain to be formed: 
one in Artemisa, two in Alquizar, and one in Batabano. At 
present, the Havana Province UBPC's consist of almost 6,600 
workers, not a final figure. 
  There are at present five bicycle factories in Cuba. The 
overall goal is to manufacture 300,000 bicycles in 1994. In 
1993, 174,700 bicyles were produced by all these plants 
together, a figure significantly higher than the 1993 figure of 
86,000. Each plant works on its own design, which leads to 
competition in making the bicycles and motivates the workers to 
do better work. All facilities are trying to improve post-sale 
services. 
  The Tropical Travel Agency in Havana sold over 10.5 percent 
more optional activities in 1993 than in 1992. In 1993, this 
brought half a million dollars more than in 1992 to the national 
economy -- said Juan Emilio Santana, director of the Tropical 
Travel Agency. Santana said that the optional activities and 
proposals targeting international tourism at the diverse tourist 
hubs also increased in 1993, with a view to increasing the 
amount of hard currency brought in. The task of the Tropical 
Travel Agency is to provide international tourists with all 
types of services and information, thus occupying the free time 
of travelers while in Cuba. 
  Cuba Vision Network at 2310 GMT on 25 January reports that 
in 
Granma Province, workers of the Manzanillo shoe enterprise 
produced more than 250,000 pairs of shoes in 1993. They are 
increasing efforts to meet the demand of sugar industry workers. 
  Radio Reloj Network at 1506 GMT on 26 January reports that 
the Havana Convention Center obtained more than $3 million in 
1993 as compared to the previous year. Adding national and 
convertible currency, its income amounts to some 6 million of an 
unspecified currency from the various activities in this center 
over the past year. More than 12,000 foreign delegates 
participated in congresses, fairs, meetings, and other forums in 
that center last year. 
  Radio Reloj Network at 1509 GMT on 26 January adds that the 
Cuban Ministry of the Steelworking Industry, the Sime, is 
working hard to become self-suffient. Sime's main objectives for 
this year are to become an exporting organization capable of 
guaranteeing its self- sufficiency, providing financial 
resources, and meeting the special demands of the national 
economy. 
  Radio Reloj at 2030 GMT on 26 January reports that an 
Asturian solidarity group donated office equipment worth $11,500 
to the accounting department of the University of Havana.

<F P=106> [Interview with Esteban Morales, Director of the Center for </F>
U.S. Studies, by Zenaida Costales; place not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Morales] The characteristics of the current 
international relations situation -- with the world going 
through a transition process, et cetera -- pose certain 
challenges for the United States: that they pay more attention 
to refurbishing U.S. foreign policy, to problems affecting the 
role of the Armed Forces, the function of the U.S. security 
policy, the importance of economic factors in future U.S. 
security policy, the strategic role the United States will play 
in important global problems, which will be related to U.S. 
foreign political leadership in future years. 
  [Costales] How do you think the Cuban issue will be treated? 
  [Morales] Well, we must say that the fundamental 
characteristics of U.S. foreign policy concerning Cuba 
essentially reflect the continuation of Bush Administration 
policy. However, I do not believe that the current 
Administration's political language is as aggressive as that of 
the Bush Administration. 
  Only superficial changes have been made. These changes 
relate 
to talks that are not negotiations as such, but discussion of 
issues. Basically, I think the Bush policy is being maintained 
because this policy on Cuba has much to do with the U.S. 
attitude of waiting for the development of internal processes in 
Cuba and how the Cuban economic reinstatement will be 
established within the new international relations process.

<F P=106> [Report by (Roberto Cavala) from the Havana Convention </F>
Center -- live] 
  [Text] This is a last-minute report. I am speaking to the 
Cuban listeners of this station's live radio news program from 
the Convention Center where the Board of the Central American 
Commission for the Defense of Human Rights [Codehuca], a 
nongovernmental organization [ngo] with consultant status at the 
United Nations, is addressing the issue of human rights in Cuba. 
The chairperson of this commission read a document to reporters 
accredited to this Fourth Latin American and Caribbean Meeting 
for Solidarity, Sovereignty, Self-Determination, and the Lives 
of our Peoples. 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] 1. The commission 
strongly and categorically condemns and repudiates the U.S. 
blockade against Cuba as unjust, cruel, and inhumane, and 
because it represents an inexcusable violation of international 
law -- the international human rights law and the established 
precepts and rules for coexistence among nations. 
  2. It urges the U.S. Government to immediately comply with 
the resolutions of the UN General Assembly to end the economic, 
commercial, and financial blockade against Cuba. 
  3. It urges the United Nations to demand that the U.S. 
Government comply with its resolutions through established 
mechanisms, as it has done with resolutions affecting other 
nations. 
  4. It lauds the Cuban Government and people for their 
important achievements, successes, and transformations in spite 
of the suffering caused by the nefarious, protracted blockade. 
  5. It supports the worthy, exalted, patriotic struggle by 
the 
Cuban people and Government against the U.S. blockade, and its 
respect for international law. 
  6. It respectfully but strongly urges the nations and the 
people participating in this meeting to adopt vigorous measures 
and initiatives intended to strengthen solidarity their sister 
nation, Cuba, in its struggles and its dreams to build a more 
just, more humane, and more democratic society. The people of 
Jose Marti need and demand it. Their unfaltering struggle, their 
poignant sacrifice of so many years, and their unrenounceable 
hope deserve it. 
  Respect for human rights means peace. 
  [Signed] The Central American Commission for the Defense of 
Human Rights, Codehuca. Havana, 27 January 1994. [end recording]

  [Text] A PRENSA LATINA news report says Ambassador Fernando 
Remirez Estenoz, Cuba's permanent representative to the United 
Nations, was today elected vice chairman of the special 
committee for the restoration of the legitimate rights of the 
Palestinian people. The Cuban diplomat, chosen by acclamation, 
was proposed by the Tunisian delegation and supported by Mali. 
  Upon addressing this UN committee, Remirez Estenoz 
highlighted the efforts to be made at a moment when the 
committee is entering a qualitatively different phase of its 
work following endorsement of the declaration of principles 
between Israel and Palestine. Remirez highlighted the duties to 
be assumed in order to contribute to monitoring the agreed-upon 
measures and to determine what assistance the United Nations 
must provide so the process can continue until restitution of 
the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people -- including 
that of the creation of their own state -- has been achieved.

  [Text] Alleged URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary 
Unity] cells downed and destroyed three power transmission 
towers last night. This happened in Las Ilusiones, Zone 18, 
Villa del Dorado, Zone 8, and the Ulises Rojas neighborhood at 
the 21-km marker on the Pacific highway, Villa Nueva 
Jurisdiction. Powerful charges downed the towers, causing a 
blackout in Guatemala City and the interior of the country. The 
blast hit Lirio Bolanos Rosas, a National Police employee of the 
National Police, on Zone 18, and had to be hospitalized. Last 
night and early this morning, technicians of the electricity 
company and INDE [National Institute of Electrification] 
estimated the damage caused at 500,000 quetzales. They did not 
make estimates on the serious damage the blackout caused to 
homes, hospitals, clinics, and computer centers, as well as to 
citizens who were the victims of crimes perpetrated under cover 
of the hour-long blackout in Guatemala City. The bomb squad 
defused a powerful device in the Ulises Rojas Neighborhood.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 28 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- Part of 
downtown Guatemala City was blacked out at about 2130 on 27 
January following an explosion of unknown origin, which was 
heard by the population. It is not known whether there were any 
casualties. 
  The blackout affected areas near the Presidency of the 
Republic, the National Congress, the Archdiocese Palace, the 
Army Information Office, the headquarters of unions and popular 
organizations, the shopping center, and several foreign press 
agencies. 
  Guatemalan firemen told ACAN-EFE they are investigating the 
cause of the blackout and the reason behind the explosion. There 
is little traffic on the streets. 
  Guatemala has lived through a wave of terrorist attacks in 
the past few weeks, which the Army blames on the guerrillas who 
are trying to discourage the population from participating in 
the referendum next Sunday to approve or reject constitutional 
reforms that would move back elections for deputies and change 
the Supreme Court. The attacks have resulted in the death of one 
person.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 27 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- A powerful 
dynamite charge exploded at an electric power pylon at 2125 
tonight, which left Guatemala City as well as the departments of 
Chimaltenango and Escuintla without power. The National Police 
report the explosion inflicted damage at the Guatemala-Norte 
station, east of Guatemala City, which distributes electricity 
from the Chixoy hydroelectric plant. 
  The terrorist act caused traffic jams in various parts of 
the 
city with traffic lights going out. Meanwhile, authorities from 
the National Electric Institute are working to restore power. 
The incident occurred 72 hours prior to the vote on a referendum 
to approve or reject 37 constitutional reforms. 
  In addition, military sources reported that Guatemalan Army 
troops sustained five casualties when they clashed with a column 
of the Revolutionary Organization of the Peoples in Arms (ORPA) 
at La Igualdad farm in La Reforma. 
  Soldier Julio Lopez Chavez told NOTIMEX that at 1300 the 1st 
and 3d Companies of the San Marcos Detachment searched La 
Igualdad farm, 280 km to the west of Guatemala City, where the 
guerrillas mined the field. The two Army companies detected the 
presence of the 15 ORPA rebels, who retreated to a very deep and 
rocky area when they noticed they had been discovered. 
  The soldiers proceeded to comb the area in search of the 
rebels. Two soldiers, Mauricio Hernandez Chun and Jose Pacual 
Merlo, died when they activated a claymore mine. Three soldiers 
were also injured by shrapnel from the mines. The soldiers' 
bodies and the injured soldiers were transferred to Coatepeque 
on the San Marcos Department border.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 27 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- Firemen have 
reported that unidentified persons have downed a power pylon, 
the third to experience this fate in the past two hours, thus 
creating a blackout in Guatemala, the second today in this 
country. 
  According to municipal firemen, an earlier explosion of a 
dynamite charge injured three persons and destroyed a tower 
northeast of this capital, which has a population of more than 1 
million. 
  Another tower in the town of San Cristobal, south of the 
capital, was damaged by a bomb that exploded at approximately 
2130 (0330 GMT). 
  The firemen have said that there is no confirmation of 
whether the first reported explosion was produced by a dynamite 
attack. 
  The downing of the power pylons produced blackouts in the 
capital and in Solola and Chimaltenango Departments in the west 
and in Jutiapa and Santa Rosa Departments in the southeast of 
this Central American country, the only country in the area 
where guerrilla violence continues. 
  The attacks are taking place on the eve of a strike by 
200,000 state employees; in the absence of Guatemalan President 
Ramiro De Leon Carpio, who is staying overnight in Honduras; and 
only 48 hours prior to a referendum to reform the Constitution 
to advance the legislative elections.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 28 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- A group of 
unidentified individuals fired at the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala 
City on Thursday shortly before midnight while almost the entire 
city was without electricity because three high tension towers 
were blown up, the Guatemalan police reported today. 
  A spokesman for the security forces told ACAN-EFE that 
unidentified persons inside a vehicle fired at the diplomatic 
mission as they drove by. No one was injured, and there was no 
property damage. 
  Embassy guards did not repel the attack, which took place at 
around 2330 (0530 GMT Friday), when the city was still without 
power as a result of three downed high tension towers in 
different areas of the outskirts of the city. No organization 
has claimed responsibility for the attack.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 28 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- Unidentified men 
in a moving vehicle last night fired into the air in front of 
the U.S. Embassy, where approximately 600 peasants are 
demonstrating to demand the U.S. mission's intervention in the 
solution of a land conflict. 
  Eyewitnesses and security guards at the U.S. Embassy 
confirmed that at 2345 (0545 GMT), several individuals in a blue 
car fired several shots. 
  The peasants, who are members of the Federation of Workers 
and Laborers [Federacion de Trabajadores y Obreros], early this 
morning are patrolling the area with sticks and machetes to ward 
off attacks. The Indians have been in front of the embassy for 
three days to request the mission's mediation with the "Penny 
Foundation" [Fundacion del Centavo], which charges them 
excessive interest rates on loans made to families to buy land 
and build houses. 
  The attack is part of the wave of violence prevailing in the 
Guatemalan capital, where in the last four hours unidentified 
individuals set off explosive charges at electricity pylons. 
There is unease among the Guatemalan people 48 hours before a 
referendum is held to reform the Legislative and Judicial 
Branches and shorten the presidential term from five to four 
years.

<F P=106> [Statement by the URNG (Guatemalan National Revolutionary </F>
Unity) General Command on the resumption of peace negotiations, 
dated 20 January 1994] 
  [Text] With the signing of the Framework Agreement on 10 
January in Mexico City, the negotiations process, which was 
impeded by the obstacles placed by recalcitrant sectors of the 
Army and private sector, is resumed. 
  This agreement to resume the negotiations is a step that 
must 
be duly assessed; at the same time, its essence and scope must 
be defined. 
  The signed document is an instrument and sets a stage that 
entails permanent and growing application. This is the renewal 
of a process that opens the doors to difficult and complex 
phases of dialogue and negotiations. This cannot be downplayed 
or overestimated. We have a great deal before us; we can 
achieve a great deal. 
  This framework, as a whole and given its specifications, 
guarantees the contents of the negotiations. 
  A necessary and essential starting point for the solution to 
an armed conflict with the characteristics of the Guatemalan 
conflict is the recovery, as a basis and foundation, of all that 
is positive from the process that began with the signing of the 
Oslo Agreement. Above all, the agreed upon agenda in Mexico 
should be maintained at the negotiations table. The essential 
political, economic, and social topics, which are called 
substantive, must not be excluded. 
  The fact that the participation of civilian sectors in the 
negotiations was agreed upon through an assembly, which will 
discuss and decide the substantive issues, and that the result 
of this opinion will be one of the most important for the 
negotiations between the Government-Army and the URNG represents 
progress. It carries undeniable political and social weight 
which undoubtedly neither of the parties can ignore. 
  The civilian sectors, summoned by the Legislative Assembly 
president, appointed by the Episcopal Conference, will 
sovereignly decide on the assembly's name, operation, internal 
policies, and mechanisms. 
  The terms of agreed upon legality and representation do not 
mean any limitation due to legal reasons; the parties have 
explicitly agreed upon this. It has also been made very clear 
and agreed upon to engage in a clean process, not to manipulate 
or hamper the assembly's work. The term "nongovernment" means 
those organizations that do not belong to or are not linked 
directly or indirectly to state structures. 
  The civilian sectors, led by the Legislative Assembly 
president, whom both parties hope will be Monsignor Rodolfo 
Quezada Toruno, have a constructive stage that its 
representatives can take advantage of to foster and express 
their aspirations. [sentence as published] 
  The negotiations must be open and trustworthy for the 
parties. Through the Legislative Assembly president, mechanisms 
will be created so that the civilian sectors can have the 
necessary information. So that certain aspects of the 
negotiations will not be manipulated, the reserve required by 
the international organizations is necessary, something we 
accept. This is not an attempt to hide the issues and results 
of the negotiations, nor does it constitute any limitation on 
the civilian sectors to freely express themselves on the issues 
they broach. 
  The United Nation's nature of moderation, with its powers to 
convene, as promoter of initiatives and as an adviser, is the 
most adequate, given the characteristics of our negotiations 
process to resolve the armed conflict in our nation. The United 
Nation's moral weight and guaranty of verification of all the 
agreements, substantive as well as operative, make it essential 
for the feasibility of the process. 
  An agreement on fulfilling human rights is not excluded from 
the negotiations. This issue, which should be immediately 
implemented and verified internationally, is the initial and 
irreplaceable point of the first negotiation session. It is the 
first test of political willingness, but, above all, it is a 
fundamental condition and guarantee for the agreed upon 
negotiations. 
  An overall agreement is only possible if all of the points 
on 
the agenda are satisfactorily resolved. This year's goal, as 
indicated in the agreement, is to make all of the necessary 
efforts to attain the signing of a firm and lasting peace 
agreement. The temporary framework does not present nor 
condition the contents and development of the negotiations, nor 
does it mean the negotiation is concluded beforehand. 
  The URNG Command affirms its willingness to continue 
fighting 
for all of the people's aspirations. It trusts that within the 
framework of this agreement, with the guarantees that the 
various sectors of Guatemalan society should give, these will 
provide their decisive contribution for the construction of a 
just and democratic peace. 
  [Signed] URNG Command 
  [Dated] 20 January 1994

  [Text] The guerrillas issued a communique to the media 
yesterday denying any involvement in the recent terrorist 
attacks and stating that "such acts are carried out by death 
squads trained and organized by the Army Staff." 
  The URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] 
Political- 
Diplomatic Commission stated that neither the EGP [Poor People's 
Guerrilla Army] nor any other guerrilla group is responsible for 
the grenade attack on 18th Street and 6th Avenue A, Zone 1, on 
17 January. One person was killed and 17 were injured in that 
attack. 
  The communique also denied any rebel involvement in the 
attacks that destroyed judicial files in Quiche, blasted the 
front of the Legislative Palace, and destroyed GUATEL radio and 
television repeater towers in Tecpan Guatemala, Chimaltenango. 
  In addition, a spokesman for the URNG Political-Diplomatic 
Commission explained via telephone that "the URNG's actions have 
not gone beyond exploding pamphlet bombs in various parts of the 
capital to mark the EGP's anniversary and to extol the struggle 
of popular organizations. " 
  The source added that the URNG attacks have not been 
designed 
to threaten human lives or damage private property because only 
light charges placed have been used. That is why, the spokesman 
reiterated, the URNG rejects the government accusations, above 
all those made by the military commander in Quiche, who accused 
the EGP of burning judicial files. 
  "The URNG General Command stresses that the terrorist 
actions 
can be attributed to sectors that oppose a political and 
negotiated solution to the internal armed conflict and to the 
death squads, which, under the direction of the Army Staff, have 
been functioning since last 28 November," the URNG spokesman 
concluded.

  [Editorial Report] Guatemala City Radio-Television 
Guatemala in Spanish at 0400 GMT on 26 January broadcasts a one 
hour interview with Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio 
by Dionisio Gutierrez as part of the regularly scheduled "Free 
Encounter" program. The discussion centers on 30 January 
constitutional referendum and begins with Gutierrez recapping 
President de Leon's previous efforts to get lawmakers and 
Supreme Court justices, who were accused of corruption, to 
resign. Gutierrez asks if constitutional reform, "which the 
people will vote on this Sunday, was the only alternative left?". 
  The president replies: "Yes, I think so within the framework 
of democracy and circumstances that have prevailed since I took 
office." He adds that the Guatemalan people have called for the 
resignation and purge of the judicial and legislative branches, 
and other alternatives to achieving this were exhausted when the 
members of these branches refused to resign, and later, when the 
Constitutionality Court suspended the referendum to allow the 
people to express their views on the issue. 
  He said: "Although the ruling was unbelievable, I had to 
abide by it. Given this situation and the political crisis that 
was brewing, the only thing left was to use a third alternative, 
which was always democratic." De Leon noted that on 30 January, 
the people will have the opportunity to vote on constitutional 
reforms so they can "say yes, the deputies should go and a new 
congress should be elected; yes, the justices should leave and 
we should have a new Supreme Court of Justice, or no, let things 
remain unchanged with the same people." 
  He also notes the people are leery of the constitutional 
reforms because Congress drafted and approved them, but "in 
politics, what counts are the results." Gutierrez adds that the 
fact that some deputies, mistrusted by the people, are 
supporting the reforms compounds the people's feeling of 
weariness. Regardless of this situation, according to De Leon, 
the democratic system will be strengthened by the reforms. 
  In response to a question regarding the political cost De 
Leon had to pay for what is referred to as "holy wheeling and 
dealing" ("santa componenda") with Congress, De Leon states he 
studied it and "was always aware of the political cost" it 
entailed, but made the decision anyway because it brought a 
degree of political stability, which was lacking "at that time" 
to the democratic system. 
  Gutierrez points out to De Leon that he chose the hardest 
and 
most loyal path because he could have called a referendum within 
a week of taking office, and he asks "why did you choose the 
most difficult course?" The president acknowledges this may be 
the most difficult course, "but if we reach the end or goal, it 
will be the most satisfying "because the Guatemalan people are 
indicating they are beginning to love and defend their 
democratic system. He notes the third option may lead to the 
results the people wanted. "If the people wanted a purge, they 
can have it by voting yes on 30 January. If the people want the 
deputies to go, they will achieve that by voting yes on the 
referendum." 
  Referring to this point, Gutierrez says this may set a 
precedent for changing the Constitution in a peaceful manner. De 
Leon feels this "may be something historic and worth noting. 
This is the first time a Constitution will be amended in 
Guatemala without a coup d'etat, to be perfectly honest, or 
without the need to use force or break established order. This 
will be the first time the constitutional mandate of two state 
branches is being broken without the use of force or ending 
institutional order." 
  As for the question of who is paying for the "yes vote" 
campaign, the president refers to the work young volunteers are 
doing and adds: "What I can assure you is that the government is 
not paying for it." He goes on to deny money from the 
confidential fund is being used in the campaign because that 
fund "no longer exists." The constitutional amendments, he says, 
will eliminate confidential expenses, thereby "ensuring, from a 
constitutional standpoint, there will not be confidential funds, 
which have allowed so much corruption to exist, not just in the 
Presidency but in all the state agencies." 
  Gutierrez asks De Leon, "What will happen if voter 
abstentionism is high in the upcoming referendum?" De Leon says 
that many things can contribute to voter abstentionism "here and 
anywhere in the world. It is unusual for any country to have a 
voter turnout rate of more than 50 percent." Voter turnout may 
not be high on Sunday because a referendum is something new in 
the country, and although regrettable, it "would not change 
things," De Leon states. He then adds, "If the yes vote won by a 
slim margin, the amendments would enter into effect." To be 
sure, he hopes a large number of people will vote and make the 
event into a "civic holiday," as there will not be losers, since 
all Guatemalan people will be the "winners." 
  When asked to consider the possibility of a "no" vote 
victory, De Leon comments that this is most unlikely, but 
"should it happen, I would have to make decisions based on 
strategies, which I will not mention here because they would no 
longer be strategies. They would be public knowledge. It would 
be regrettable, more than regrettable because it would create a 
situation of unforeseen consequences. The people would not stand 
by idly. Even very small extremist radical groups would try to 
profit from this situation." He also notes that groups like the 
Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) would be 
"delighted" by this outcome because they are hoping "there will 
be social turmoil," and a crisis will ensue. In any crisis, the 
president has to be ready for certain decisions and strategies 
to be implemented, he affirms. 
  Gutierrez asks him to explain what aspects of the 
constitutional amendments he does not like. "I dare say," the 
president replies, "all the amendments are positive." Continuing 
on the same vein, Gutierrez asks the president to list five 
major advantages of the amendments. Besides the fact "the 
deputies will have to go, which is what the people want, and the 
people will elect a new congress, that the chief justices will 
have to go, and there will be a new Supreme Court of Justice, 
the first thing is that the confidential fund will no longer 
exist. This is a major step against corruption," according to De 
Leon. 
  Second, power abuse will be prevented because Congress will 
no longer be in charge of trying deputies accused of wrongdoing. 
Another government branch will handle these cases. 
  Third, the budget will be public for the first time, thanks 
to the amendments. De Leon says, "This means honesty and better 
control over public spending." 
  According to De Leon, the fourth advantage is that they 
strengthen and provide real autonomy to the Comptroller's 
General Office. "This means controlling public spending, so that 
officials from the president on down do not -- simply put -- 
steal, enrich themselves illegally, or steal the Guatemalan 
people's money. 
  Fifth, the Attorney General's Office is strengthened to 
prosecute illegal actions and prevent political impunity. 
Besides these five advantages, De Leon talks about another 
amendment that prevents the Bank of Guatemala from making loans 
to the government. Although he vows never to act recklessly in 
issuing money without backing, "we must guarantee, that in the 
future, governments will not do as past governments have done." 
  In De Leon's opinion, other advantages are that 
municipalities will receive 10 percent of the national budget, 
which is to be spent on programs to help the most needy; the 
mandate of the president and deputies is reduced to four years; 
there will no longer be alternate deputies; and the Supreme 
Court will be depoliticized. 
  The host tells De Leon he has read the amendments and he 
finds it odd that opposition to them is so strong. Some people 
in the country have said there has been little time to study 
them and would have wanted them to cover more areas. Gutierrez 
states that if approved, the Constitution will be much better 
than it was. De Leon acknowledges the people have not been told 
this is "merely a first step, the beginning, in restructuring 
and modernizing the state," something that is achieved by 
purging and restructuring the state branches, and, most of all, 
by setting a precedent. The new deputies will take office with 
fewer privileges and they will be aware the people are watching 
them, he states. 
  When asked if the deputies will be compensated for the 
months 
left in their term if the "yes" vote wins? De Leon flatly 
replies: "God forbid!" Gutierrez then asks De Leon when will 
Deputy Rodil and his team leave. De Leon replies that based on 
these amendments, deputies and their alternates will leave their 
seats 60 days following the referendum or on 31 March. Elections 
are to be held 120 days later. "In August, we could have a new 
Congress and Supreme Court," De Leon indicates. 
  On the topic of voter abstentionism, De Leon asks the people 
to ponder the matter because the "destiny of Guatemala lies in 
the hand of the yes or no vote. He thinks that "to urge people 
not to vote is irresponsible." He adds that the URNG is asking 
the people to vote no "because they would gain if we had chaos 
or a crisis."

  [Text] Bolivia and Brazil today signed a new bilateral 
agreement. Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim arrived in 
our country to sign it. 
  It should be recalled that Bolivia and Brazil signed a 
partial agreement in 1983. The new agreement not only grants 
preferential tariffs -- which involve reduced taxes on imports 
-- but also provides for business cooperation and the exchange 
of commercial information. 
  [Begin Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar recording] 
It proves the fruitful talks and exchange of viewpoints that we 
maintained during an active day with Foreign Minister Amorim. 
[end recording] 
  There are two very important points in the joint communique. 
For example, Bolivia and Brazil reaffirmed their predisposition 
to make efforts so that the agreements between Mercosur [Common 
Market of the South] countries and Bolivia -- aiming at allowing 
Bolivia's full participation -- will be given priority within 
the regional process. 
  As for Bolivian-Brazilian integration in the energy field, 
the two ministers reiterated the importance and priority that 
the governments of Brazil and Bolivia have attached to the 
natural gas purchase contract signed by Petrobras [Brazilian 
Petroleum Corporation] and Bolivian Government Oil Deposits. 
  [Begin Amorim recording] At this meeting I obviously could 
not discuss technical details because this must be done by the 
Petrobras people. But I believe the important thing is the 
political reaffirmation of our determination to develop this 
project, which is important for Bolivia and also very important 
for Brazil. [end recording] 
  This was the conclusion of the official visit paid by 
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, who thanked Bolivian 
Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar for the expressions of 
appreciation and friendship extended to him.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities monitored through 27 January. 
Source is listed in parentheses following each item: 
  Finance Minister Fernando Illanes signed a loan agreement 
for 
32 million German marks -- $18.6 million -- with the German 
Government. The funds will be used to supply electricity to 
Larecaja Province and La Paz Department and potable water to 
Oruro Department. (La Paz LA RAZON in Spanish 31 Dec 93 p B2) 
  Fedor Perez, deputy director general of the General Customs 
Directorate, DGA, reported that the DGA collected 946 million 
bolivianos in 1993, a 17.9 percent increase compared with 1993. 
But he said this was less than national budget estimates due to 
international agreements signed with Colombia, Ecuador, 
Venezuela, Peru, Argentina, and Chile that provide for the 
reduction or exemption of tariffs. (La Paz LA RAZON in Spanish

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Minister of Government German </F>
Quiroga Gomez during a working breakfast with the editors of LOS 
TIEMPOS in La Paz; date not given] 
  [Text] La Paz, 25 December (LOS TIEMPOS)--As the next 
general elections of 1997 approach, the Bolivian political 
situation shows no sign of political opponents with anywhere 
near the influence of the present government led by the 
Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (MNR). Above all, this 
situation is due to the fact that the opposition parties are 
fragmented and apparently have removed themselves to the 
sidelines of the process of change in which the whole country is 
involved. 
  These comments were made by Dr. German Quiroga Gomez, the 
minister of government, in an extended conversation which he had 
with the editors of LOS TIEMPOS during a working breakfast held 
in La Paz. In the course of the conversation the minister made 
several statements about the political panorama reflected in the 
present situation. On this basis he made several predictions 
about the prospects for the 1997 general elections, which will 
be held at the end of the constitutional term that began in 
August 1993. 
  Quiroga flatly denied that his party has any pretensions to 
long-term dominance in the exercise and projection of political 
power which the MNR now holds. He rejected accusations of that 
kind which are often made by opposition groups. He stated that 
the time for long term political dominance by a single party has 
passed and cannot be repeated, due to the political progress 
which the democratic process has made in the national community. 
  In that framework the minister of government pointed out 
that 
to keep democracy healthy and to make it possible to continue 
with the political and institutional development of the country, 
the country needs to have a strong, capable, and well-organized 
opposition with which it will be possible to reach effective, 
cooperative agreements. At the same time such an opposition will 
assure organized society of an effective role in checking on the 
performance of government bodies. 
  In that sense Quiroga stated that the government of 
President 
Sanchez de Lozada has observed with concern how the opposition 
parties, principally consisting of the Nationalist Democratic 
Action Party (ADN) and the MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary 
Left], presently appear to have "lost their way" in terms of 
their political position. They even appear to be markedly 
disorganized internally. In his view these are aspects which 
cannot in any way be considered positive developments for the 
development of the democratic system in the country. 
  Minister Quiroga said: "The conduct of the leaders of the 
ADN 
and the MIR, since Hugo Banzer Suarez and Jaime Paz Zamora, 
their respective leaders, abandoned them, following the last 
municipal elections, makes them look like the `tail end' of the 
CONDEPA [Conscience of the Fatherland party]. This is only a 
regional party, without any significance at the national level. 
It is not in a position, nor is it able to play the role of 
leader of the opposition." 
  He noted that, in this situation, the government coalition, 
with the MNR as its central axis, has gained control of 65 
percent of the municipal councils in the country following the 
most recent local elections. This shows that the alliance 
established in August 1993, with each one of its components 
retaining its own, ideological position and participating 
separately in the election campaign, has good prospects for 
continuing to control the national administration even beyond 
1997.

<F P=106> [Article by Eddy de la Quintana] </F>
  [Text] La Paz, 25 December (LOS TIEMPOS)--After the next 
administration assumes office, the Ministry of Government, in 
its program for acting as the principal, organizational 
mechanism between the Executive Branch of the government and 
civil society, will include within it an office charged with 
handling investigations of various complaints against corruption 
made throughout the country. 
  The announcement was made by Dr. German Quiroga Gomez, 
minister of government, in an exclusive interview with LOS 
TIEMPOS in La Paz. He said that the new role to be played by the 
new Ministry of Government (formerly the Ministry of the 
Interior) is essentially aimed at ensuring the effective and 
continuing defense of society as a whole. 
  In that sense he pointed out that the struggle against 
corruption is now of fundamental importance, not only for the 
government but for the Bolivian people as a whole. For this 
reason it has been decided to take appropriate action, in an 
organized and systematic way, to fight more effectively against 
this endemic evil of society. 
  Quiroga stated that the Ministry of Government will provide 
this new, anticorruption office with the whole structure and 
resources of the state intelligence and security organizations 
to undertake investigations of corruption in the different 
departments of government and in other areas of national life. 
  For this purpose he indicated that letter boxes will be set 
up in the most heavily populated places in the principal cities 
of the country so that citizens can deposit their complaints 
about corrupt actions. These complaints should contain basic 
information which might assist investigations and could make 
suggestions which would contribute to the success of this effort. 
  The minister explained that the anticorruption office will 
not in any way be turned into an organization dedicated to 
"witch hunts or a search for ghosts." He said that the work to 
be done will use advanced methods of investigation and will be 
handled in a responsible and serious way, so that it will 
generate confidence and credibility in the eyes of public 
opinion. 
  He stated that the work to be undertaken by this office will 
be essentially investigative in character. Once the appropriate 
investigations are completed and concrete evidence is available 
on clearly criminal cases of corruption, the evidence will be 
turned over to the appropriate courts for action in coordination 
with the Ministry of Justice.

  [Text] La Paz, 25 December (LOS TIEMPOS)--Another matter 
mentioned by Minister German Quiroga in the interview obtained 
by LOS TIEMPOS in La Paz was referred to in the forecast made in 
the program of "Popular Participation" which the government 
plans to implement during the next administration. 
  In this respect he pointed out that the democratic process 
reestablished in Bolivia in 1982, following a long period of 
military governments which came to power in successive coups 
d'etat, created an imperious need, which could not be postponed, 
for setting up new means of effectively channeling the will of 
the people at policymaking levels and in the institutional 
processes of leadership of the country. 
  The minister of government said that this objective of 
converting the present, democratic and representative system 
into a new, participative and dynamic system aimed at the basic 
institutions of Bolivian society should be clearly expressed in 
the first place in the structure of municipal governments and 
then in the forms of representation in Parliament, through the 
election of deputies on separate lists, as projected in the Law 
on the Need for Reform of the Political Constitution of the 
State. 
  He said that the recently promulgated Law on Majorities and 
Minorities as a standard for municipal elections has the same 
objective. In that way the rights of citizens will be legally 
guaranteed in the future, not only to vote but also to choose, 
preventing the possibility that their views, expressed through 
the ballot box, could be subject to later political 
negotiations, as has happened up to now. 
  He noted that this plan for participation by the people, 
which has been formulated as a fundamental part of the program 
of government proposed to the country by the MNR [Nationalist 
Revolutionary Movement], seeks to establish a system of 
political participation which "goes beyond the political 
parties." As a result, he repeated, "It would be madness to say 
that we are allegedly trying to set up a program for long-term 
control of the government, as some opposition groups charge."

  [Text] La Paz, 25 December (LOS TIEMPOS)--Minister of 
Government German Quiroga has stated that the performance of his 
ministry during the period up to 31 December has been positive. 
He pointed out that this office, which in the past was marked by 
its essentially repressive role, has been turned into an 
instrument through which cooperation is sought and promoted and 
which plays an important role in reaching viable solutions for 
the social conflicts which arise in the country. 
  He indicated that in political terms Bolivia has made 
progress of great significance, which has been recognized by the 
international community as a whole. He stated that the 
development of the political and democratic process in the 
country during the past 10 years has definitively left behind it 
the ups and downs of the military coups d'etat which 
characterized Bolivia in the past. 
  In the social field he emphasized that the Ministry of the 
Interior, initially, and the Ministry of Government, more 
recently, played a preponderant role in the solution of a series 
of social conflicts which came up in the country. This was done 
through negotiations and agreements reached with the Bolivian 
Labor Federation, as well as with organizations representing 
peasant farmers, particularly those which represented the 
producers of coca leaves. 
  At the same time he said that effective results have been 
achieved in the difficult and continuing struggle being carried 
out against narcotics trafficking. He indicated that the most 
important achievements in this regard included breaking up gangs 
of drug traffickers. He mentioned the cases of Wilson Ferrufino, 
who had resources of more than $4.0 million in Cochabamba, and 
later on that of "Nando" Gutierrez, whose property in Santa Cruz 
was evaluated as being worth more than $3.0 million. Their 
principal subordinates are under arrest and face trial. In the 
institutional sense he pointed out that the Ministry of 
Government is involved in the changes taking place on the basis 
of the restructuring approved by the executive branch. These 
changes are fundamentally directed toward the reorganization of 
the judicial system, in accordance with the objectives set forth 
in the political agreements signed on 9 July 1992 during the 
previous administration. 
<H5>  The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly </H5>
  In the evaluation made by Minister Quiroga of his actions in 
the Ministry of Government since 6 August 1993 he underlined the 
following, significant aspects: 
  The good was that he has undertaken an important process of 
institutional change in the Bolivian Police to turn it into a 
highly effective organization able to inspire confidence and to 
provide security in society as a whole. 
  The bad was that he was not able to set out in concrete form 
the objectives proposed for 1993, particularly regarding the 
order issued by the Supreme Court of Justice for the capture of 
criminals against whom sentences have already been handed down. 
This is the situation regarding Luis Garcia Meza, the former 
dictator who continues to be a fugitive from justice. 
  The ugly was that he has personally become involved in "the 
worst job" in the cabinet, holding a ministerial portfolio which 
is a "shock absorber" for all of the conflicts which come up in 
this country and is almost always the first to receive bad news.

<F P=106> [Article by Edwin Miranda V.; first paragraph is editorial </F>
introduction] 
  [Text] La Paz 25 December (LOS TIEMPOS)--The Clinton 
administration has promised to provide $180 million in 1994 for 
programs for the fight against narcotics trafficking in Bolivia. 
  Bolivia will be the only South American country which will 
not have significant reductions in the aid which it receives in 
the form of financial cooperation with the United States 
Government in the struggle against narcotics trafficking. This 
was officially announced by Minister of Government German 
Quiroga Gomez. 
  In the course of the exclusive interview he granted to the 
editors of LOS TIEMPOS in La Paz Quiroga stated that in the 
framework of "uninterrupted North American aid" Bolivia expects 
to receive about $180 million in 1994. These will be new 
resources earmarked for providing support for the struggle 
against drug trafficking, as well as for undertaking alternative 
development strategies through an effective program of 
substituting other crops for coca leaf production by peasant 
farmers. This assistance will be based on "promises made by the 
administration of President Bill Clinton to Bolivia during the 
visit by President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada to New York on 28 
September, during the most recent meeting of the United Nations 
General Assembly." 
<H5>  Growing External Aid </H5>
  According to the explanation provided, North American aid in 
the field of fighting against illicit drug trafficking is 
directed at the interdiction of the traffic, alternative 
development, crop eradication, and the implementation of 
integral development projects in the Chapare and Yungas areas, 
where coca leaves have been traditionally produced. 
  Quiroga said: "Bolivia has signed financial and technical 
cooperation agreements with the United States since 1990." At 
the same time he pointed out that North American financial 
cooperation is closely related to the help which it provides to 
the Bolivian balance of payments. He added: "For this purpose it 
has been spending between $40 and $60 million annually." 
However, at the same time he made clear that this significant 
amount of help has been conditioned on the eradication of a 
certain number of hectares of fields in the Chapare and Yungas 
areas which were planted to coca leaves. 
  On this point he emphasized that it is possible that in 1994 
the total amount of aid for this purpose "will decline because 
of the fact that Bolivia, as of this date, has not eradicated 
the number of hectares planted to coca leaves which it promised 
to complete by December 1993." 
  The second type of United States cooperation is related to 
the Ibta-Chapare Project, which essentially is aimed at the 
industrialization of a large part of the tropical area of the 
Department of Cochabamba. Quiroga explained that this technical 
aid is aimed at promoting alternatives, in terms of products and 
crops, in areas producing coca leaves. 
<H5>  New Projects </H5>
  During the meeting of the Consultative Group of the World 
Bank which took place a short time ago in Washington, Bolivia 
proposed to the international financial community the 
possibility of approving "greater economic support and better 
programs for the promotion of products other than coca leaves." 
Alternative development plans of this kind are presently being 
carried out in areas where coca leaves have traditionally been 
planted. 
  According to the minister of government, the Bolivian 
committee which visited Washington and was led by the minister 
of finance and economic development presented for the 
consideration of the international financial community a new 
proposal for alternative development for the areas which have 
traditionally produced coca leaves.

  [Text] Kingston, Jamaica, 27 Jan, CANA -- The Jamaica 
Government has tabled supplementary estimates in parliament 
seeking an additional three billion dollars to finance its 
1993/94 budget. 
  The revised estimates which are likely to be approved early 
next month will increase the budget for the financial year to 
43.392 billion dollars (one Jamaican dollar just over three US 
cents) from the original 40.371 billion dollars. 
  The additional money will go to recurrent or housekeeping 
expenses, which move up from 28.146 billion dollars to 31.758 
billion dollars while the capital side of the budget has been 
slashed by 591 million dollars from 12.225 billion dollars to 
11.634 billion dollars. 
  The greater portion of the increase will cover public debt 
payments and public sector salaries.

  [Text] Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, 26 Jan, CANA -- Trinidad 
and Tobago has mobilised its army in the fight against crime on 
the street. 
  National Security Minister Russell Huggins said 300 armed 
soldiers have been placed on foot patrol in crime-hit areas 
throughout the country. 
  They are in the eastern part of Port of Spain, the southern 
San Fernando City and in some rural eastern and southern 
villages. 
  The issue of putting soldiers on foot patrol was mentioned 
in 
a statement to the nation last Friday by Prime Minister Patrick 
Manning, who expressed concern over the increase in serious 
crimes. 
  Last year, almost 20,000 serious crimes were reported to the 
police. There were 108 murders, including drug-related killings 
and the execution of key state witnesses. For this year, the 
country has so far witnessed 17 murders. 
  Following Manning's statement to the nation, Huggins met 
with 
Commissioner of Police Jules Bernard and chief of defence force, 
Brigadier Ralph Brown, over the weekend to work out a plan to 
have the soldiers on foot patrol. 
  Previously, soldiers had joined policemen in joint-patrols 
but this came to an end when there were no working vehicles to 
accommodate the special crime-fighting initiative. 
  Huggins said that like ordinary citizens, the soldiers were 
allowed to make citizen's arrest. 
  He also said that the soldiers' presence would act as a 
deterrent to criminal activites while bringing comfort to 
citizens. 
  "Having soldiers unaccompanied by the police is designed to 
bring comfort to the citizens," he said. 
  "It is not envisaged that bandits, seeing armed soldiers 
would say they don't have powers of arrest and decide to pull 
out their guns and commit robberies. 
  "The comfort aspect is just as important."

  [Text] Sao Paulo -- Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf said 
yesterday that he might support Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos 
Magalhaes' presidential candidacy, but only after advising that 
he himself had not yet given up on his own candidacy. Maluf 
imposed a condition for his possible support for the governor's 
candidacy: that it result from a consensus between parties like 
Magalhaes' PFL [Liberal Front Party], Maluf's PPR [Progressive 
Renewal Party], and some other ticket. 
  He said: "Governor Antonio Carlos is a good candidate. I 
could support him if he were the consensus candidate for the 
PFL, the PPR, and the PP [Popular Party]. I am not a candidate 
myself, but I have not renounced my candidacy." 
  In his opinion the main point is that the candidate for 
president should be chosen by an alliance of several parties. 
Maluf disclosed that for more than 3 months he has been talking 
with leaders of several parties in an attempt to build such a 
union. In addition to his own candidacy and to that of the 
Bahia governor, Maluf includes the following leaders in the list 
of possible PFL presidential candidates: ex-Minister Jorge 
Bornhausen, Pernambuco Senator Marco Maciel, his fellow party 
member and Para Senator Jarbas Passarinho, and PP President 
Alvaro Dias. 
  He said: "If we can make a consensus decision in March, why 
should we make it in February? In politics, agreements are 
announced only after they have been reached." 
  Maluf said he liked the idea of PMDB [Brazilian Democratic 
Movement Party] Senator for Rio Grande do Sul Pedro Simon, the 
government leader in the Senate, making an alliance between the 
PMDB, PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], PDT [Democratic 
Labor Party], and PTB [Brazilian Labor Party]. He disagrees, 
however, that the objective of the coalition should be to find a 
candidate to oppose the candidacy of PT [Workers Party] 
President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. 
  "It should be an alliance for Brazil," he said. 
  As he usually does, however, Maluf did not lose the 
opportunity to criticize Lula. He reiterated that the PT 
candidate does not have enough experience to govern the country, 
noting that he, Maluf, "would not vote even for his own brother 
if he were to be a beginner at Planalto Palace." 
  Maluf did not spare criticism of Itamar Franco, either, 
saying that the president "has neither a liking for nor devotion 
to power," while complaining about the government's delay in 
designating the new cabinet: 
  "We have been without a government for 60 days and, worst of 
all, no one has realized this." 
  Maluf charged Itamar Franco with having no political will to 
enforce an economic plan that can curb inflation. He said the 
fiscal adjustment proposed by the government is not sufficient 
for reducing the cost of living, and that the government must 
cut spending. 
  "Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's main adversary 
is the government itself," he said.

  [Text] The PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] and 
the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] will vote together 
on the constitutional reform, but will sponsor separate 
presidential candidates. 
  In Brasilia today, the executive boards of the two parties 
held separate meetings. 
  The PMDB will adopt a single position for the vote on the 
constitutional reform. The decision was made by the party 
executive board. Party positions will be studied on a weekly 
basis. 
  As for the presidential succession, the majority believes 
there should be an internal survey to choose a candidate. The 
new party program will be submitted to the national party 
convention in March. 
  Deputy Luiz Henrique, the PMDB president, will lead the 
drive 
for unity within the party and for future alliances. He began 
by talking with members of the PSDB, whose executive board also 
met in Brasilia today. 
  The two parties consider it possible to form an alliance as 
early as in the first electoral round, will continue to 
negotiate, but will not give up the designation of their own 
candidates for president. 
  [Begin PSDB President Tasso Jereissati recording] During a

  [Text] The lack of a quorum has prevented the approval of 
three provisional measures from the government fiscal adjustment 
plan: provisional measures No. 404, which creates a control tax 
on the financial system; No. 407, which increases the income tax 
of large companies; and No. 401, which authorizes charging the 
IOF [Financial Operations Tax] on private funds and portfolios 
[fundos'e'carteiras livres]. 
  Luiz Carlos Santos, government leader in the Chamber of 
Deputies, believes that the result of the voting session today 
was not bad for the government, even though the mentioned 
provisional measures were not approved, because most of the 
other measures were approved. He said that provisional measures 
407 and 404 will not be presented again because of the annuity 
principle [principle by which a tax cannot be implemented on the 
same year it is approved by Congress]. 
  Some congressmen remarked that it was a contradiction that 
Congress did not approve a tax increase on large companies when 
yesterday it approved a tax increase on individuals. 
  Meanwhile, Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso has 
just said that the national Congress has acted against the 
people by approving a tax increase only for wage earners. 
  [Begin recording] [Cardoso] I think it was a very bad thing 
because they approved a tax increase for individuals, for the 
citizens, but why not for large companies? Why shouldn't banks 
pay a control tax? What are those who blocked the approval of 
these measures defending? I do not know. Certainly it is not 
in favor of the people. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Is it compromising for you? 
  [Cardoso] No, it is compromising for those who defended a 
wrong attitude. [end recording]

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Brazil monitored through 27 
January. Source is listed in parentheses following each item: 
  December 1993's $604 million trade surplus was the lowest in 
the past six years. However, compared with 1992, the year's 
surplus was positive, $13 billion. (Brasilia Radio Nacional da 
Amazonia Network in Portuguese 0900 GMT 21 Jan 94) 
  Brazil's foreign exchange reserves at the beginning of 1994 
hit a record of almost $33 billion in international liquidity. 
This is an increase of more than $2 billion compared with 
November 1993, when reserves stood at $31.01 billion. The surge 
is due to the favorable foreign exchange rate in December 1993 
resulting from the impressive flow of dollars into the country 
-- $3 billion -- attracted by high interest rates and good 
returns on the stock exchange. (Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO PAULO in 
Portuguese 22 Jan 94 Section 1 p 5) 
  According to statistics from Petrobras, Brazilian Petroleum 
Corporation, national consumption of oil by-products in 1993 was 
the highest in the last four years, amounting to an average 
1.278 million barrels daily -- a 3.5 percent increase compared 
with 1992. The highest increases were in the consumption of fuel 
oil, which was up 5.7 percent, and gasoline, which rose 4.8 
percent. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 24 Jan 94 p 
10)

<F P=106> [Article by Giselle Chassot: "Brizola Supporters Seek </F>
Alliance With Left Wing of PMDB"] 
  [Text] A surprising political alliance may be in the making 
for the upcoming general elections. On one side is Rio de 
Janeiro Governor Leonel Brizola's PDT [Democratic Labor Party], 
and on the other is at least a part--the so-called ethical 
wing--of the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]. The 
PDT's president, Deputy Neiva Moreira (Maranhao), is trying to 
conceal the fact by saying that "so far there is no localized 
effort in that direction," but the president of the PMDB, Deputy 
Luiz Henrique (Santa Catarina), says that the two parties "will 
sit down to talk before the end of the year [1993]." 
  What is most surprising about the deal is Brizola's 
willingness to give up an old precondition. According to 
reports, the governor of Rio de Janeiro is willing not to impose 
his own candidacy for president of the republic as the basis for 
any discussion. "The problem with these alliances is that they 
zero out all political aspirations," commented Senator Pedro 
Simon (PMDB, Rio Grande do Sul), the government's leader in the 
Senate. He admitted that his party was indeed going to talk to 
Brizola "before this year is out," but he feels that any 
political alliance that might result should unite all of "social 
democracy and also include the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy 
Party]." 
  Simon commented that the only party that could not be 
included would be the PT [Workers Party], since it already has a 
candidate (party president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva). "The PDT 
also had Brizola at one time, but now he is willing to talk," 
the senator continued. He emphasized that in order for any 
agreement to be possible, all parties would have to sit down at 
the negotiating table as equals or, in this case, without having 
already picked their candidates. 
  Courtship--Some PMDB and PDT congressmen say the courtship 
between the two parties was the idea of Neiva Moreira, the PDT's 
president; Luiz Salomao (Rio de Janeiro), party leader in the 
Chamber of Deputies; and Deputy Vivaldo Barbosa, all on the 
PDT's side. The cupid on the PMDB's side was reportedly Jarbas 
Vasconcellos, mayor of Recife. 
  In the PDT, both Neiva Moreira and Salomao deny having taken 
the first step toward the agreement. Moreira insists that 
Brizola is the party's candidate for president of the republic 
and that the governor is not even free to decide whether or not 
he will head the party list if there really is a political 
alliance of some kind. "That decision is made not by him but by 
the party," he emphasizes. Salomao says the idea is not his, but 
he adds enthusiastically that "in view of the crisis in the 
PMDB, if we do not try to attract the wing of the party that 
interests us, it will wind up in the arms of the PSDB." 
  Salomao feels that the problems facing the PMDB at the 
moment 
may lead to a rapprochement with the party's so-called ethical 
wing. Or, as the PDT leader prefers to put it: "We are not 
interested in the PMDB's Sarney wing or its Quercia wing; what 
interests us is the Simon wing." 
  Although no one is openly claiming responsibility for the 
flirtation between a rather significant wing of the PMDB and the 
PDT, there is consensus on at least one point: the initiative 
came from the PDT. The PMDB's president points out that such an 
agreement already exists in some states. "But for the time 
being, there is nothing that goes any further than that; I have 
simply received from Neiva Moreira, Vivaldo Barbosa, and Luiz 
Salomao a statement of their desire to hold official talks 
between the PMDB and the PDT," he says. 
  Luiz Henrique claims, however, that the possible 
rapprochement with the PDT is in no way related to the crisis 
being experienced by the PMDB. Targeted by accusations that 
several of its most prominent members are involved in the budget 
scandal and split into several wings, the PMDB cannot agree on a 
consensus candidate. Even so, the president feels that if part 
of his party is arousing the interest of the PDT, that is 
"because of the party's size and importance." 
  Luiz Henrique made it a point to emphasize that there is no 
agreement between the two parties. "They took the initiative of 
talking, and that is very good," he said. According to the 
president of the PMDB, the flirtation between the two parties 
began less than two weeks ago. 
<H5>  PDT Even Calls on Silvio Santos To Ensure Growth </H5>
  Sao Paulo--The PDT leadership in Sao Paulo is trying once 
again to resurrect the party in that state and trying to induce 
businessman and TV host Silvio Santos to join in order to run 
for governor in the upcoming elections. The PDT's new secretary 
general in Sao Paulo, former Deputy and former Osasco Mayor 
Francisco Rossi, says Governor Leonel Brizola has given him the 
job of conducting the talks with Silvio Santos in order to 
attract him to the party. 
  "We are working against time because Silvio still belongs to 
the PFL [Liberal Front Party], and the deadline for changing 
party membership is 8 January," Rossi points out. Silvio Santos 
will meet with his staff on 3 January to make a decision. 
  For its part, the PDT is already announcing the start of a 
campaign to attract 1 million new members in Sao Paulo. At the 
moment, the party cannot even say how many members it has in the 
state. It has only one federal deputy from Sao Paulo--its 
regional president, Liberato Caboclo--and one state deputy, 
Hilkias de Oliveira. "But the party will be different after the 
next elections," promises Rossi, who was a member of the PDS 
[Democratic Social Party] and the PTB [Brazilian Labor Party] 
before joining the PDT in September. 
  Rossi says he talked to Silvio Santos 20 days ago. "The 
talks 
are still under way, and the only difficulty is that deep down, 
he still has some hope of being the PFL's candidate for 
president," Rossi admits. "He says that politics is not part of 
his life at present, but he does not rule out the possibility 
that it might be in the future," the PDT leader says. 
  Parallel with that, the Sao Paulo PDT is talking to 
businessman Antonio Ermirio Votorantim, superintending director 
of the Votorantim Group. "Antonio Ermirio is also leaning toward 
being a candidate, but he had a bitter experience in the race 
for state governor in 1986," says Rossi. "In any case, people on 
the street are constantly calling on him to be a candidate, and 
as far as he is concerned, that is more important than any 
opinion poll. Besides, he has great admiration for Leonel 
Brizola," Rossi adds. 
  In its efforts to attract Silvio Santos and Antonio Ermirio, 
the PDT will have to match forces with the PFL. Both men are 
also being considered by the PFL as possible candidates for 
governor of Sao Paulo, according to the president of the PFL's 
executive board in Sao Paulo, former Minister Antonio Cabrera. 
  Elephants--This is not the PDT's first attempt to strengthen 
its position in Sao Paulo, where its share of the vote has 
historically been small. On several occasions it has invested in 
former politicians of declining prestige in the attempt to 
reorganize itself. Successive examples of this were former 
Deputy Roge Ferreira, his political heir Adhemar de Barros 
Filho, former Lieutenant Governor Almino Affonso, and former 
Deputy Airton Soares. None of them was able to put the party on 
solid ground or even to get anyone on the new slate elected. 
Brizola received less than 2 percent of Sao Paulo's vote for 
president of the republic.

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Foreign Affairs Celso Amorim by </F>
Luiz Recena, place and date not given: "A Good Partner Need not 
Be a Reflection"; introductory paragraphs in italics as 
published] 
  [Text] In international relations, the best partner 
is the country that is not a reflection of the other, stronger 
partner. Having points in common does not mean a lack of 
disagreements. It is along those basic lines, among others, that 
Brazilian foreign policy is being consolidated once again, under 
Itamar Franco's administration, in a clear, cooperative, and 
independent manner. 
  Ambassador Celso Amorim has been in the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs since June, first as secretary general and then 
as minister. He is the main architect of that consolidation--a 
task involving bilateral relations, regional efforts, and 
Brazil's participation in such wider forums as GATT or the UN 
Security Council. Here is a look back at the year as seen by 
Celso Amorim. 
  [Recena] Mr. Minister, what do you consider the chief events 
of this year? 
  [Amorim] I will begin by emphasizing the idea, first brought 
up by the president of the republic, of a free trade area in 
South America--an idea that we are exploring bilaterally and 
within Mercosur [Common Market of the South]--and I hope it will 
become stronger. There are no new developments to mention, but I 
hope that the idea will soon take on a more definite shape. 
  [Recena] What about Mercosur? 
  [Amorim] Well, the final evaluation will have to be made 
next 
year when the presidents meet in Uruguay on 17 January, but 
intense negotiations have continued within Mercosur, and it is 
expected that Brazil and Argentina will overcome the 
difficulties that have arisen, especially as regards the Common 
External Tariff. The negotiations are not easy, but they are 
continuing to make progress. As I have been saying, we are 
reaching the moment of truth on several points--in sensitive 
areas affecting not only us--where Brazil is not the only one 
with protectionist interests. All four countries have specific 
interests, and this is now becoming increasingly clear. That is 
why we are entering a period of intense negotiations that will 
extend beyond the meeting by the presidents, but the presidents 
may be able to use the progress to date to lay down clearer 
parameters. 
  [Recena] Do you want to single out anything particular on 
the 
subject of Argentina? 
  [Amorim] Concerning Argentina, I would like to single out 
the 
recent meeting in Sao Paulo between the ministers of finance and 
foreign affairs of both countries. Brazil was also represented 
by the minister of industry and commerce. It was a meeting at 
which we were able to get negotiations moving again. I also 
regard as very important the visit by Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Guido Di Tella to the INPE [National Institute of Space 
Research] and the CIA. It was important as a demonstration of 
our exclusively peaceful intentions. 
  [Recena] Beyond the regional realm, what was the most 
important event? 
  [Amorim] It was undoubtedly the conclusion of the Uruguay 
Round. That was the most important international event from the 
standpoint of economic and even political relations, which 
needed a balanced solution from that round. We are pleased that 
the Uruguay Round has been completed. Obviously, it was not 
ideal--it did not give us everything we wanted--but important 
progress was made as regards market access: the average 
reduction on the part of the developed countries was on the 
order of 38 percent, and that will mean greater access for 
Brazilian products. It also marks the start of a reduction in 
farm subsidies, and while modest, that reduction is sizable and 
will bring benefits. In addition, there is GATT's role in laying 
down rules, another area in which considerable progress was 
made. Establishment of the World Trade Organization was another 
very important advance, since that institution will be able to 
actually regulate international trade. Brazil participated 
actively in those negotiations. 
  [Recena] What did its participation consist of? 
  [Amorim] There were seven years of hard work, and we made a 
very big contribution. It is good for Brazil that the agreement 
in question was possible. It is important to emphasize that the 
Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs consistently conducted 
those negotiations in an efficient manner with the cooperation 
of the Ministries of Finance, Agriculture, and Industry and 
Commerce. I feel that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should be 
given credit for the coordination effort: the effort to conduct 
those negotiations, which were the most complex negotiations to 
date in the field of trade and economy. 
  [Recena] What were relations with the United States like in 
1993? 
  [Amorim] I have just returned from a visit to the United 
States. It was a short visit but one involving a lot of work. I 
met with many officials, among them Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher and the White House security adviser, Anthony Lake. 
I have heard many favorable comments about that visit. I took 
the opportunity it provided to present the Brazilian viewpoint 
with great frankness, stressing something that was not being 
sufficiently emphasized: the fact that our points of agreement 
are much greater than our disagreements. But public opinion in 
both countries and even some government circles focus more 
strongly on the disagreements. It may be natural to do so, but 
it is not right, because then the focus is on 5 percent of the 
issues at most and ignores the fact that we agree on the other 
95 percent. 
  [Recena] How did you approach that subject? 
  [Amorim] The message that I tried to convey, and I think it 
was well received, well understood, and accepted, was this: 
precisely because Brazil is a country with its own specific 
characteristics and the same basic principles as those guiding 
U.S. society--democracy, a market economy, and respect for human 
rights--well, at the same time that we have those things in 
common, we also hold different views on various subjects. And a 
good partner is not one that reflects the other. A good partner 
is the one that is in a position to disagree and engage in 
dialogue in the search for a joint solution. I cited a few 
examples of that: our profitable coordination in the Security 
Council, including the time during Ambassador Ronaldo 
Sardemberg's presidency, and our action at the Human Rights 
Conference, at which Brazil, precisely because of its special 
characteristics, played a fundamental role in ensuring the 
success of that conference and managed to conclude a negotiation 
that had seemed impossible of solution because of the 
disagreements among the Asian, African, and Western blocs. That 
message was very well received and very well understood, and 
during meetings at the White House, they asked for Brazilian 
suggestions regarding the hemispheric conference recently 
proposed by Vice President Al Gore. 
  [Recena] What is the greatest difficulty in those relations? 
  [Amorim] The issue of industrial property, which I also 
brought up during my visit. I explained that we expect to find a 
satisfactory solution. Brazil has been acting constructively 
while listening, of course, to the National Congress. They need 
to understand that--the fact that there are diverse sectors in 
Brazilian society, just as there are in U.S. society. It would 
be a political mistake jeopardizing the mature partnership we 
already have if some kind of unilateral measure were adopted 
this coming February. I have greater hopes following the Uruguay 
Round, whose agreement as approved also deals with the issue of 
intellectual property. 
  [Recena] What is your expectation? 
  [Amorim] It is very optimistic. And also because our 
relationship with the United States is symbolic of the 
integration we want to have with the other developed countries. 
I am scheduled to visit Germany and France, where I intend to 
talk along that same line: about cooperation while always 
respecting each country's special characteristics. 
  [Recena] Portugal: you were there recently. How was it? 
  [Amorim] It was an extremely productive visit. At the 
bilateral level, we had a frank discussion of the opportunities 
and problems, including the question of Brazilian members of the 
liberal professions practicing in Portugal. A task force will 
start dealing with that issue in January. At the start of 
February, we will be visited by Minister Durao Barroso. There is 
also the possibility of a bilateral presidential summit meeting 
during the first half of the year. Apart from bilateral matters, 
I want to mention Portugal's sincere support for the Brazilian 
idea of forming a Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries. I 
would very much like to hold meetings by the foreign ministers 
of those seven countries in Brasilia and Lisbon before this year 
is over, at which time we would lay the foundations for that 
community. 
  [Recena] In the domestic area, what subjects are of concern 
to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs? 
  [Amorim] We are assigning great importance to ratification 
by 
Congress of the various agreements we have in the nuclear area. 
Those agreements were approved by the Chamber of Deputies in 
September, and we are confident that it will be possible to get 
them approved by the Senate as well before the year is over or 
as soon after that as possible. This is important in order to 
show the world clearly that Brazil is pursuing exclusively 
peaceful objectives in its economic and technological 
development, and we will then be in a better position to play an 
active role as regards the supplying of advanced technologies. 
  [Recena] The president of Communist China was in Brazil. 
What 
has changed? 
  [Amorim] It was an extremely important visit and one that 
will be repaid by our president in the coming year [1994]. We 
intend to send missions to the Asian countries. Thailand's 
minister of foreign affairs will visit Brazil in the near 
future. We are going to open an embassy in Vietnam. We were also 
visited by the president of Guyana, and I have just made a visit 
to Colombia--proof in both cases that we are seeking complete 
integration in the region. 
  [Recena] What about East Europe and Russia? 
  [Amorim] There was the visit by Minister Andrade Vieira, who 
signed a very important protocol, and various sectors in the 
government and in private enterprise are thinking of that big 
market. These are visits which mobilize and bring about positive 
reactions. I would also like to emphasize the decision by the 
president of the republic to open an embassy in Kiev, Ukraine. 
  [Recena] In conclusion.... 
  [Amorim] In conclusion, I would like to announce that next 
year we are going to give a great deal of attention to making 
Brazilian culture known abroad. It is through culture that we 
will be able to present a good image of Brazil abroad. And a 
good image of Brazilian culture has very big effects. Our 
culture is very rich and attractive; it arouses the interest and 
attention of other countries naturally. It is a very important 
factor in promoting investments and trade. We will certainly be 
able to carry out important projects in this area in the new 
year.

<F P=106> [Unattribued article: "TSE Says Only 11 Parties Qualify for </F>
Presidential Race"] 
  [Text] Yesterday the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) 
published its list of parties meeting the legal requirements for 
nominating candidates for president of the republic in 1994. 
Eleven parties qualified: the PDT [Democratic Labor Party], PFL 
[Liberal Front Party], PL [Liberal Party], PMDB [Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party], PRN [National Reconstruction Party], 
PSD [Democratic Social Party], PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy 
Party], PT [Workers Party], PTB [Brazilian Labor Party], PP 
[Progressive Party or Popular Party], and PPR [Progressive 
Renewal Party]. Under the terms of Law No. 8,713, candidates can 
be nominated only by parties that received at least 5 percent of 
the votes counted in the 1990 elections for the Chamber of 
Deputies in at least one-third of the states, meaning, in 
practice, that they must have a minimum of 15 elected deputies. 
The same rule applies to parties wishing to run gubernatorial 
and senatorial candidates. 
  The reduction in the number of candidates is the result of 
the new Electoral Law (Law No. 8,713/93), which has been in 
effect since 1 October 1993, the date when it was published in 
the DIARIO OFICIAL. Although the PRN bloc had only 10 members on 
1 October, it meets the legal requirement because it did receive 
5 percent of the vote in the 1990 elections. The other seven 
parties with representatives in the Chamber of Deputies on 1 
October could run a single additional presidential candidate if 
they formed a coalition. 
  Alliances--It can therefore be expected that there will be a 
maximum of 11 candidates to succeed President Itamar Franco. But 
while that number is mathematically possible, it is not likely, 
seeing that political alliances lead to coalitions. In 1989, 20 
candidates vied to succeed former President Jose Sarney. The 11 
parties in question are also eligible to run candidates for 
governor in 27 states and for the 54 vacancies in the Senate. 
  Of the 20 parties expected to participate in the 1994 
elections, only two--the PMN [National Mobilization Party] and 
the PRP [Progressive Republican Party or Revolutionary Party of 
the Proletariat]--are not represented in the National Congress, 
but they have the permanent registration required by law. 
Nineteen have permanent registration, and one--the PSTU [United 
Social Workers Party]--has only temporary registration, but it 
does have one federal deputy, thus meeting another legal 
requirement. Two parties--the PTC [expansion not given] and the 
PT do B [Communist Party of Brazil]--are in the process of 
receiving permanent registration. The TSE is to decide by the 
day after tomorrow whether those two parties will also be 
allowed to nominate candidates. 
  Generally speaking, the new Electoral Law will benefit the 
voter, according to the TSE's presiding judge, Sepulveda 
Pertence. "The law tried to make things easy for the voter by 
adopting two ballots for the elections: one for candidates to be 
elected by majority vote and another for proportional voting. 
The only disadvantage is that it prevents us from holding two 
rounds of balloting and organizing parallel vote counting, since 
the two ballots will be deposited in a single ballot box." 
Although deploring the slow vote count that will result, 
Sepulveda admits that it is the only way to prevent fraud. 
  The following parties will be eligible to run candidates for 
president of the republic in 1994, for state governor, and for 
the Senate: the PMDB, PFL, PSDB, PDT, PT, PL, PP, PPR, PSD, PTB, 
and PRN. 
  The following will be able to run candidates in elections 
under the proportional system (that is, for the Chamber of 
Deputies and state legislative assemblies) in 1994: the PSB 
[Brazilian Socialist Party], PC do B [Communist Party of 
Brazil], PPS [Popular Socialist Party], PSTU, PV [Green Party], 
Prona [National Order Redefinition Party], PSC [Social Christian 
Party], PMN, and PRP.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Budget Cuts Total $12 Billion"] </F>
  [Text] The new version of the 1994 budget, announced 
yesterday following a reformulation of the bill sent to Congress 
in August, will result in federal spending cuts of $12 billion 
compared to expenditures in 1993 and of $22 billion in 
comparison with the original budget bill for 1994. The National 
Treasury's revenues and expenditures will total $88.8 billion. 
Raul Jungman, executive secretary of the Ministry of Planning, 
points out that the bill will become effective only if approved 
by Congress. "The congressmen share responsibility for 
stabilizing the economy, and it will be up to them to say 
whether we will have a balanced budget with no deficit." The 
total budget, including debt rollovers, comes to $280 billion. 
  The tough budget bill says that the government will spend 
only what it collects in 1994 and that public debt instruments 
will be issued only to roll over the domestic and foreign 
floating debt that already exists. According to economist Edmar 
Bacha, special adviser to Minister of Finance Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso, that budget balance is the foundation stone for 
adoption of the second and third stages of the economic 
stabilization program. Those stages call for adopting the URV 
[Real Value Unit] and subsequently making it a strong currency. 
"We are freeing ourselves of the need to use inflation and 
corruption to balance the budget. We are exchanging those 
instruments for negotiation, which is the only alternative we 
have left, since the other choice would be dictatorship." 
  Surrealism--Bacha explained that in previous years, the 
Executive Branch would send Congress an "unrealistic" budget and 
get back a "surrealistic" law. Since it was impossible to 
execute the expenditures called for in that law, the 
administration would guarantee those expenditures, wait for 
inflation to erode values, and make the money available. The 
result of that game has been the increase in inflation. 
  In its budget revision, the government is working with real 
interest rates of 15 percent for 1994, since there will be no 
more indebtedness. That will help reduce debt service, which 
should decline from $8.7 billion in 1993 to $7.7 billion in 
1994. "That drop is feasible, since we will no longer have a 
deficit of $22 billion to finance," says Bacha. 
<H5>  Effort </H5>
  However, the Legislative and Judicial Branches are not 
making 
the same effort as the Executive Branch to cut spending. The 
Chamber of Deputies, the Senate, and the National Accounting 
Office will receive about $305 million for investment and 
operations in 1993 [as published]--51 percent more than their 
probable actual spending level in 1993 (expenditures included in 
the original 1993 budget or in supplemental budgets passed 
during the year). The courts will receive $699.6 million, or 42 
percent more than the $470 million they received in 1993. For 
its part, the Executive Branch will receive $43.1 billion, or 17 
percent less than the $52.1 billion received in 1993. 
  A number of ministries have been given special treatment, 
however, examples being the military ministries (EMFA [Armed 
Forces General Staff], Army, Navy, and Air), which will receive 
$2.2 billion for operations and investment. That is an increase 
of 48 percent over 1993 and the result of tough negotiating with 
the economic area. 
<H5>  Administration Expects To Collect $84 Billion </H5>
  The administration expects to achieve record collections of 
$84.6 billion in taxes, compulsory contributions, and fees in 
1994. Those revenues, the largest in the country's history, will 
consist of the following: 
  Import tax (II): This tax is imposed on Brazilian imports 
and 
will bring in $2.12 billion, or 0.47 percent of gross domestic 
product (GDP), in 1994. 
  Industrialized products tax (IPI): The administration 
expects 
this tax to yield $10.94 billion, or 2.41 percent of GDP. 
  Income tax (on individuals and corporations): This is the 
federal tax that brings in the most money. The administration 
expects it to provide $17.54 billion, or 3.87 percent of GDP, in 
1994. 
  Financial operations tax (IOF): Estimated IOF receipts for 
1994 total $3.7 billion, or 0.82 percent of GDP. 
  Provisional tax on financial operations (IPMF): Collection 
of 
this tax will begin next Monday, with an expected yield in 1994 
of $4.8 billion, or 1.06 percent of GDP. Some congressmen 
believe that the administration is underestimating revenues from 
this tax. 
  Social investment contribution (Cofins): Now that the 
Federal 
Supreme Court has ruled that the collection of Cofins is 
constitutional, the administration expects it to yield $8.06 
billion, or 1.78 percent of GDP. The administration has not 
included in these revenues the money deposited in a Cofins 
account with the courts by businessmen. 
  PIS [Social Integration Program]/Pasep [Government Employees 
Welfare Fund] contribution: The administration expects to 
collect $5.22 billion in PIS/Pasep contributions in 1994. That 
is the equivalent of 1.1 percent of GDP. 
  Social contribution based on net profit: Revenues from this 
contribution are expected to total $3.74 billion, or 0.83 
percent of GDP. 
  Employers' and employees' social security contribution: Here 
the administration estimates that revenues will total $20.6 
billion, or 4.55 percent of GDP. 
  Government employees' social security contribution: 
Government employees are expected to contribute $2.05 billion, 
or 0.45 percent of GDP, in 1994. 
  Other (including supplemental port fees, military pensions, 
contributions to the training wage, amounts due from the freight 
supplement and modernization of the merchant marine, and so on): 
Revenues from these taxes are estimated at $4.03 billion, or 
0.89 percent of GDP. 
  Other revenues (including the contribution based on lottery 
revenues): The administration expects to obtain $1.5 billion, or 
0.35 percent of GDP, from this type of collection. 
<H5>  Bill Predicts 4-Percent Rise in GDP </H5>
  The administration is expecting GDP to be about 4 percent 
higher in 1994 than in 1993. "Studies conducted by the 
administration, backed by indications relative to the basic 
parameters for projecting national accounts, suggest the 
advisability of adopting a forecast to the effect that GDP in 
1994 will increase by about 4 percent compared to 1993," the 
administration has announced in a message sent to Congress with 
the budget for 1994. 
  The message sent by President Itamar Franco regarding the 
General Budget of the Union supports the economic team's 
position that it is necessary "to restore normal operating 
conditions in the Brazilian state so that it will be possible to 
stabilize the economy and guarantee social justice." And for 
that very reason, it says that the administration and various 
segments of society must be prepared to carry out the difficult 
task "of balancing the national accounts." "To do that, 
decisions by the National Congress are essentially and 
fundamentally necessary in order to provide the Executive Branch 
with the tools making it possible to overcome the difficult 
situation we find ourselves in today." 
  Wages--The administration also expects to spend 681 billion 
cruzeiros, or 5.3 percent of GDP, on personnel expenditures and 
charges (including both active and retired personnel). Those 
projections, contained in the message sent to Congress along 
with the budget bill for 1994, were made, the administration 
says, in accordance with the prime rule that the government's 
basic payroll in 1994 cannot exceed the 1993 payroll. 
  On the basis of its analysis of the current economic 
situation and the macroeconomic scenario for 1994, the 
administration announces in its budget bill that "the main 
problem in the Brazilian economy continues to be inflation, 
which, while not threatening to begin any rapid upward movement, 
has been exhibiting remarkable resistance to a decline." 
  Prices--According to the administration, "the predominant 
diagnosis of Brazilian inflation points to the fiscal crisis as 
reflected in individual defensive postures by those responsible 
for price formation, whose practices are affected basically by 
their perceptions of the state's fiscal difficulties." 
  And it adds: "In that context, stabilization of the economy 
presupposes implementation of a prior agreement aimed at 
reversing people's expectations and establishment of the basic 
preconditions for the desired economic stabilization." The 
administration says in connection with its budget bill for 1994 
that "as 1993 comes to a close, the Brazilian economy has been 
continuing the recovery begun in September 1992." 
<H5>  Ministries Most Affected </H5>
  The Federal Government's budget for 1994 will include cuts 
of 
up to $12 billion compared to what was spent in 1993. About $8.7 
billion of that will come out of the operating and investment 
budgets of the ministries. Those most affected will be the 
Ministries of Social Welfare and Regional Integration, whose 
budgets will be cut by nearly 70 percent, and the Ministries of 
Agriculture, Health, Education, and Mines and Energy, which have 
lost an average of 40 percent of what they had in 1993. 
  The Ministry of Navy plans to spend nearly 300 percent more 
than it did this year. The Judicial and Legislative Branches and 
the Strategic Affairs Secretariat expect to spend 50 percent 
more. The budget still has to be debated in Congress by the 
congressmen, who are expected to submit amendments affecting the 
amounts proposed by the Executive Branch. 
  The above figures are part of the Budget of the Union for 
1994--one of the pillars of the Ministry of Finance's economic 
adjustment program--and they were announced yesterday by Raul 
Jungmann, executive secretary of the Ministry of Planning; Edmar 
Bacha, special adviser to the Ministry of Finance; and Luis 
Carlos Nerosky, secretary of federal budgets. 
  Deficit: The cuts announced today, added to the expected 
increase in revenues, mean that the administration is 
eliminating the $22 billion deficit included in the first budget 
bill, which was sent to Congress in August. 
  A comparison of the funds allocated to the ministries in the 
budget submitted in August with those in the final version 
announced yesterday shows that the reductions are impressive: 
nearly $20 billion. In fact, that figure represents the 
difference between what the ministries wanted to spend and what 
the economic team actually authorized.

<F P=106> [Report by Samuel Prieto Rodriguez in San Cristobal de Las </F>
Casas from the "Good Morning From Mexico" newscast] 
  [Text] The National Human Rights Committee [CNDH] issued 
from San Cristobal de Las Casas, Chiapas State, a report on its 
work in Los Altos de Chiapas. 
  According to the report, there has been an individualized 
follow-up investigation of the legal situation of 131 persons 
reportedly arrested, including three minors. Of those persons, 
60 have formal arrest warrants against them, and 58, including 
one minor, are free. 
  It is also known that 18 persons who are Guatemalan, 
Salvadoran, and Honduran nationals are at the disposal of the 
immigration authorities in Tapachulas for violating the General 
Population Law [Ley General de Poblacion]. 
  The CNDH reports that out of 400 missing person reports, 278 
people have been located. 
  Regarding the criticisms from nongovernmental organizations 
-- particularly from Amnesty International -- the CNDH said it 
believes the time will come for them to settle those 
differences. For the time being, the CNDH said, it is focusing 
all its attention on complaints and its work in support of the 
civilian population. 
  On another topic, Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de 
Las 
Casas, said all the Mexican people, regardless of their 
religious preferences, must get involved in the search for a 
profound solution to the problems brought up during the conflict. 
  Ignacio Diaz De Leon, executive secretary of the 
Inter-Religious Council meeting in San Cristobal de Las Casas, 
said the role of the Council is to raise society's consciousness 
regarding the dignity of the indigenous groups.

  [Text] Manuel Camacho Solis, Chiapas State peace and 
reconciliation commissioner, has called for more respect for the 
role of churches in the conflict area so as not to provoke forms 
of violence. After meeting with evangelicals on 26 January, 
Camacho considered as very damaging to the peace process the 
statements accusing church members of instigating the armed 
conflict. He explained this could create new forms of violence 
instead of contributing to the resolution of the situation. 
  After leaving Los Pinos Residence, where he met with 
President Salinas de Gortari, Camacho announced that things are 
moving on the right track, adding that at noon on 27 January he 
will report the results of the measures taken to the Zapatist 
National Liberation Army forces.

  [Excerpts] Mexico City, 27 Jan (EFE) -- Manuel Camacho 
Solis, presidential commissioner for peace and reconciliation, 
today unexpectedly postponed his reply to the demands of the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) for a possible dialogue 
to end the armed conflict in Chiapas State. 
  Camacho said the postponement of the reply, which had been 
announced on 25 January for 1800 GMT today, is due to the fact 
that he had received in the last few hours "new information and 
elements that allow progress toward a dialogue." 
  Camacho reiterated that the only objective of this entire 
effort is achieving an end to hostilities, and that is why he 
decided to postpone the reply. "This is a delicate moment, which 
we must handle with utmost responsibility," Camacho Solis said. 
[passage omitted] 
  Camacho's announcement has created a great deal of 
anticipation in Mexico City, where there is conjecture about the 
origin of the new information received by the presidential peace 
commissioner. The peace commissioner and Bishop Samuel Ruiz of 
San Cristobal de las Casas (Chiapas) are in the Mexican capital. 
The bishop has been appointed the Mexican Government's mediator 
with the EZLN rebels. [passage omitted]

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 26 Jan (AFP) -- 
The Coordinating Board of Nongovernment Human Rights 
Organizations [Conpaz] today reported that the decomposed bodies 
of two young men were discovered on Monday, following their 6 
January arrest by police in Las Margaritas Municipality. 
  In a statement to the media last night, Conpaz member Roger 
Maldonado confirmed the bodies of Jorge Solis, 21, and Eduardo 
Gomez, 22, were found "in an advanced stage of decomposition" 
near a rural road in Las Margaritas. 
  Citing eyewitness reports, Maldonado said the young men had 
been arrested by policemen, transferred to a local jail, and 
"moved that same day by Mexican Army soldiers" to another town. 
Their corpses, which had been "mutilated" by buzzards, showed 
"numerous knife wounds on different parts of the bodies," 
according to Maldonado. 
  For the past two weeks, international organizations have 
charged the Mexican Army with alleged human rights violations 
and "extreme abuse" against prisoners. These accusations have 
been denied by the Defense Ministry. 
  Meanwhile, amid expectations of a possible start to 
negotiations between the government and the guerrilla forces, 
the capital's news media on Wednesday "urged" political and 
social reconciliation in southern Mexico. Some 26 days after 
the rebellion broke out in Chiapas, the media is viewing as 
"positive" the rebels' offer to negotiate a series of demands, 
as well as President Carlos Salinas' promise to seek a solution 
to the crisis "through dialogue, reason, and harmony." 
  "The most urgent matter is to work toward reconciliation," 
it 
was stated in an editorial in the progovernment morning 
newspaper EL MATUTINO. The independent newspaper LA JORNADA 
asked both parties to "take action" by way of "specific 
decisions that will lead to a dialogue for which the entire 
nation is waiting and hoping." 
  In communiques that were released Tuesday, the Zapatist 
National Liberation Army (EZLN) proposed a "public dialogue" 
with the government based on an agenda that includes its 
political, social, and economic demands. "Peace Commissioner" 
Manuel Camacho Solis replied he would announce on Thursday a 
"detailed proposal" to carry out "a serious, honest, and 
responsible dialogue" with those who rebelled on 1 January. 
Moreover, Salinas made a quick trip on 25 January to Tuxla 
Gutierrez, capital of Chiapas, where peasants and Indians 
demanded food and clothing, medical attention, and support for 
the reconstruction of areas affected by military clashes. 
  All of these facts, which have been interpreted by the media 
as "encouraging signs" of rapprochement, improve upon last 
week's situation in which the possible beginning of a political 
negotiation was far from certain. "The EZLN destroyed the 
filigree President Salinas had constructed around himself during 
his five years in office," and it has "compelled the regime to 
take stock of its situation," wrote EL FINANCIERO columnist 
Raymundo Riva Palacios. 
  During his visit to Chiapas, Salinas promised 
representatives 
of 280 Indian organizations he would help them "promote peace, 
development, and justice," adding that the government "favored a 
project to improve the people's life."

  [Text] Mexico City, 27 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari admitted today that the state's information 
system "did not work" in preventing the conflict in southeastern 
Chiapas State. "I spoke about what didn't work, and there were 
fundamentally two things," Salinas de Gortari said during a 
meeting at the presidential residence with the cabinet, 
governors, and legislators. 
  The president noted first "the remoteness of authorities and 
the resulting lack of communication and information on what was 
happening there, and second the state information system." 
Salinas appointed a commissioner for peace and reconciliation in 
Chiapas on 10 January during a reshuffling of his cabinet, which 
he described as "a recognition of what didn't work." The 
president told the officials and legislators with whom he had 
breakfast that a deep reflection on political matters was 
necessary. 
  "Now more than ever we need politics in the best concept of 
the word, meaning as a task, an endeavor, a commitment in favor 
of the loftiest causes of the people, and as the art of avoiding 
confrontation," Salinas stated. Local authorities must not be 
satisfied with saying that they know about the problems of their 
regions, the president indicated. "They have to be there; they 
have to get out more." 
  The president urged officials "to work, go out more to all 
the states of the republic, be closer to the people and their 
problems, and be closer with solutions in favor of our 
countrymen." The Mexican head of state stressed that "political 
circustances that we need to acknowledge" are among the causes 
that led to the situation in Chiapas. 
  "Many cases of abuse... have turned into narratives and 
stories. On occasions there has been a lack of political 
homework by the authorities and organizations to be close to 
their fellow citizens, as well as a lack of opportunities." 
President Salinas de Gortari stressed that "it is truly wrong 
to try to link poverty and needs with violence. If that were 
the case, one-third of mankind would be up in arms today." 
  "We must explicitly recognize it. That is why we said this 
is not an Indian uprising but an uprising with the participation 
of Indians, several of them facing hardships, others practically 
tricked into it." After noting that the only surprise in 
Chiapas has been the attempt to use violence as a method to 
remedy the situation, he added: "That is indeed alien to the 
institution building we have been engaged in for several 
generations." 
  "There is nothing the aggressor group can do that can exceed 
the Mexican state's capacity to react with a response committed 
to peace, justice, liberty, and democracy," the president said. 
Salinas reiterated that the Mexican Army "acted and has been 
working ably and loyally in line with its constitutional 
responsibility in response to the request by the authorities" of 
Chiapas State. There are some indicators in Chiapas that point 
to "major lags accumulated over decades, even centuries," the 
president admitted. He has supported actions to overcome social 
backwardness in that state and the damage of the conflict. 
  On 1 January, an armed group arose in Chiapas to press the 
demands of Indians who took over towns, thus necessitating Army 
intervention. On 10 January the government adopted 
reconciliatory measures to seek a political solution to the 
conflict.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 27 Jan (EFE) -- Approximately 1,000 
people participated in a demonstration today in front of the 
Haitian parliament demanding its dissolution and that a tribunal 
assume power. 
  The demonstrators expressed their support for the 
resolutions 
issued by the so-called "Congress of the Northern Citizens' 
Group" [Congres del Colectivo de Ciudadanos del Norte] 
recommending a military tribunal assume power. 
  In its 26 January session, the Chamber of Deputies did not 
discuss the resolution proposed by the northern citizens group. 
They thought it was "irrelevant" and instead announced the 
Chamber is working on a proposal asking President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide, currently in exile in Washington, to appoint a prime 
minister. Aristide was overthrown on 30 September 1991 by a 
group of military officers headed by General Raoul Cedras. 
  Following a traditional practice begun in the days of 
Francois Duvalier's dictatorship, the demonstrators were 
transported in vehicles from distant parts of the country to the 
capital. This time, the groups traveled in state-owned buses. 
  Commenting on the demonstration, Chamber of Deputies 
President Frantz Robert Monde said the fact that Haitians cannot 
reach an agreement to end the crisis "is sad." Monde added, "we 
will never yield under pressure." 
  Meanwhile, deputies have asked the leaders of the 
demonstration to assume their responsibility to prevent threats 
against the parliament. The demonstrators demanded parliament be 
closed because, according to them, "it is not complying with its 
mission."

  [Text] The Revolutionary Front for Haitian Advancement and 
Progress [FRAPH] demands an explanation from the employers' 
associations that have decided to stop all activities during the 
period from 28 January to 9 February. FRAPH Organization 
Secretary Emmanuel Constant considers this decision a complement 
to the international embargo imposed on Haiti. Constant 
denounces this decision which he labels political 
thoughtlessness that will have bad consequences on the lives of 
the middle classes and the urban and rural masses. According to 
the FRAPH organization secretary, the businessmen, wealthy 
shopkeepers, have decided to close the country of Dessalines 
[Haitian liberator]: 
  [Begin recording] Today, the situation is grave because 
enemies of the nation, businessmen, wealthy shopkeepers have 
decided to block the evolution of the national majority. In 
fact, they adopted a unilateral measure. They have decided to 
shut down the country of Dessalines. What about the poor negroes 
whose fathers are still in Africa? They will get nothing. 
  FRAPH is asking questions about this stand by the Haitian 
employers, and demands explanations as to the ambiguity of such 
behavior and the gravity of its consequences. FRAPH considers 
this measure a supplement to the international embargo enforced 
by President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, whereas the businessmen, 
the mainspring of the Haitian economy, should direct their 
efforts -- in a joint nationalistic spirit of patriotic concern, 
with the courageous Haitian people, the vital forces of the 
country -- to the application of a war economy in order to 
alleviate the sufferings of the nation. 
  No, gentlemen shopkeepers: Together with the Haitian people, 
the middle classes, the soldiers, the peasant class, we in FRAPH 
say no. No, gentlemen shopkeepers: The Haitian people have been 
misled too often, have been humiliated too often. We must... 
[changes thought] it is not our responsibility to inflict this 
on them. FRAPH therefore launches a call for calm among all 
sectors of the nation, but especially invites the low-wage 
earners, the small merchants, the worthy elements of the middle 
class, the lucid elements, the class... [changes thought] the 
employees of the public administration, and the Haitian people 
to keep cool. [end recording]

  [Text] The 15 Haitian employers' associations, which 
announced their decision to close all businesses from 28 January 
through 9 February in an effort to prompt the protagonists of 
the crisis to assume their responsibilities, have formed a 
crisis committee in charge of following up the resolution 
relating to it. This committee includes the following 
personalities: Raymond Roy, Bernard Craan, Maurice Lafortune, 
Reynold Bonnefil, (Dominique Carvonis), Fritz Brandt, and 
Michael Madsen. 
  Before the resolution was proposed and the crisis committee 
formed, the participants in the 25 January meeting at the Villa 
Creole Hotel spent a great deal of time discussing the content 
and form of another proposal in which the following message 
would be sent to the international community: Come with your 
president [Aristide], install him, and lay down your rules. 
  Following this decision, the Haitian Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry invited the presidents of employers' associations, the 
members of the executive councils of those associations, 
businessmen and industrialists in general to a meeting to 
execute the decisions contained in the 25 January resolution. 
  We still do not know whether or not the supermarkets are 
concerned by this temporary closing. Several supermarket 
officials contacted by Signal FM stated that no decisions have 
yet been made.

  [Text] The Professional Association of Banks, APB, says it 
fully supports the spirit of the resolution adopted on 25 
January by the other members of the private sector, that is, the 
closing of enterprises from 28 January to 9 February. The 
association announces that it will, however, continue partial 
service to its customers during the period of cessation of 
commercial and industrial activities. 
  The savings and housing banks will remain open to the public 
from 0900 to 1200 on Wednesday, 2 Feb; Friday, 4 February; 
Monday, 7 February; and Wednesday, 9 February. The banks explain 
that by this measure, they wish to fulfill their responsibility 
to the public, allowing customers to prepare for any possibility 
during this period of stoppage that the private sector intends 
to observe.

  [Text] Basseterre, St. Kitts, 26 Jan, CANA -- In the 
aftermath of clashes outside parliament, the opposition St. 
Kitts-Nevis Labour Party on Wednesday asked for outside help to 
solve political problems triggered by an inconclusive general 
election last November. 
  "It is time for the regional and international communities 
to 
come to the assistance of the people of St. Kitts and Nevis in 
finding a solution to our problems before the situation 
escalates further," the party said in a statement. 
  The party is pressing for fresh general elections, arguing 
that the minority coalition government formed by Prime Minister 
Kennedy Simmonds' People's Action Movement [PAM] and the Nevis 
Reformation Party has no moral authority to run the twin-island 
state. 
  The coalition holds five of the eleven seats in parliament. 
The Labour Party has four (like PAM) and the Concerned 
Citizen's Movement two. 
  On Wednesday, Labour Party supporters took their campaign 
for 
fresh elections to parliament, meeting for the first time since 
the November 29 election. 
  Outside parliament, they clashed with police, who fired stun 
grenades to keep back the crowd and clear the way after the 
presentation of the traditional throne speech for the exit of 
Governor-general Sir Clement Arrindell, Prime Minister Simmonds 
and other officials. 
  At least two persons were reported to have been injured. 
  The Labour Party said parliament "was opened amid loud 
noises 
from unarmed people calling for fresh elections, shattering 
glass and bottles, smoke bombs, tear gas explosions and 
concussion bombs fired on the protesters by the police". 
  The party said businesses and banks had been closed, school 
children sent home and government departments closed to the 
public. 
  It accused the government of "repressive and military action 
... just to open parliament". 
  The party said it was clear "that the people of St. Kitts do 
not intend to accept the Simmonds regime, and they would 
continue to struggle for the government of their choice and for 
fairness and justice until Dr Simmonds honours the agreement he 
made with the national church leaders for fresh elections within 
six months". 
  Simmonds described the protest action as "unfortunate and 
really distressing". 
  The police reported the incident had been brought under 
control by midday.

  [Text] Kingstown, St. Vincent, 25 Jan, CANA -- St Vincent 
and the Grenadines prime minister, James Mitchell, says 
government intends to become more involved in negotiations with 
the British fruit-buying company, Geest on contracts for the 
sale of bananas in Europe. 
  "We are preparing our negotiations with Geest and the 
government intends to get more active in the negotiations with 
Geest in the future," he said. 
  "We can't leave it entirely up to the (Banana Growers) 
Association because they do not have the expertise to deal with 
this critical issue." 
  Mitchell was providing an update on the government's 
position 
on bananas and the outcome of recent discussions with Phillipe 
Darmuzey, the European delegate to the Caribbean. 
  He said action was to be taken on three fronts as far as the 
european union was concerned. 
  Efforts are to be made to access Stabex [expansion not 
given] 
funds provided under the Lome Convention as compensation for 
loss of earnings on exports of bananas. 
  The possibility of accessing funds under the Lome VI 
regional 
indicative programme for agricultural assistance and bananas 
particularly was also addressed, Mitchell said. 
  Funds under this programme were recently dislodged following 
discussions with European officials in Brussels, he said. 
  "Now that the Greek presidency is taking certain initiatives 
in the European Union we discussed how we could assist the 
process in lobbying or by any other activity in ensuring we have 
a special assistance fund developed for assistance of the banana 
industry," Mitchell reported. 
  On the question of a reported proposal by the U.S. company 
Chiquita to purchase bananas from the Windward Islands, Mitchell 
said no proposal had been put forward. 
  "We are prepared to look at all the options but I would not 
want to interfere with the long-standing understanding 
relationship with geest unless I were to see something 
substantial," Mitchell said. 
  A one-year interim contract with geest expired at the end of 
1993 and the Governments of Grenada, Dominica, St Lucia and St 
Vincent and the Grenadines and banana officials are preparing to 
re-negotiate. 
  Officials of the Windward Islands Banana Association 
(Winban) 
have prepared a document for perusal by governments and industry 
officials going into the negotiations. 
  Sources said the removal of a clause which binds the 
Windward 
Islands to selling bananas exclusively to Geest is among the 
proposals which Winban has made.

  [Text] Quito, 27 Jan (AFP) -- The United States has 
confirmed it "will do all that is necessary" to help Ecuador in 
its struggle against drug trafficking, Foreign Minister Diego 
Paredes reported today. He added that it was this fight that 
prompted guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia (FARC) to kill 11 Ecuadoran policemen and soldiers. 
  The Ecuadoran official announced that U.S. Secretary of 
State 
Warren Christopher sent a note to Ecuadoran President Sixto 
Duran-Ballen lamenting the death of the 11 uniformed men during 
a FARC ambush. The 11 men were involved in a narcotics 
operation in the area of the Putumayo River, at the Colombian 
border, in December 1993. 
  The U.S. Government "realizes these personnel were killed 
while courageously confronting and combating the threat of 
international drug trafficking, and it values the sacrifices 
made by the national government in this struggle," Christopher 
stated. 
  The note from the United States also "guarantees that its 
government will do everything it can to help Ecuador in this 
effort," Paredes pointed out. 
  The foreign minister added that Ecuador will not budge in 
its 
struggle against drug trafficking and terrorism through the 
application of the law without having second thoughts, and by 
respecting human rights and the country's institutional system.

  [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner 
stated on 26 January that our country will not establish 
diplomatic relations the PRC. He indicated that the two 
countries will seek to expand trade relations and that the 
possibility of opening trade offices in Asuncion and Beijing 
will be studied. 
  The foreign minister outlined the government's official 
position following the first visit to Paraguay by a PRC business 
delegation, headed by the president of the Chamber of Commerce 
of Beijing. The PRC delegation met with local businessmen and 
with directors of the Chamber of Commerce seeking to increase 
bilateral trade. 
  Ramirez Boettner explained during a news conference: "We 
maintain relations with the Republic of China, but this in no 
way prevents us from maintaining private trade relations with 
the PRC. A trade delegation has visited. I have met with them 
to see whether trade and economic exchanges can be increased, 
but no further steps will be made toward establishing diplomatic 
relations." 
  Also on 26 January, the foreign minister received copies of 
the credentials of the new ambassador of the Republic of China 
(Nationalist China), Agustin Tingtsu Liu [name as published], 
who will present his credentials to President Juan Carlos 
Wasmosy when he returns from his visit to Ecuador and Peru. 
  Ramirez Boettner and Agustin Tingtsu Liu established a line 
of action to increase bilateral relations in the spheres of 
training, technical cooperation, and investment. [passage

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Paraguay monitored through 27 
January. Source is listed in parentheses following each item: 
  A General Customs Directorate report notes that export 
earnings in 1993 were $748,145,804.64 -- free-on-board value, a 
15.3 percent rise compared with the previous year. Exports rose 
33.5 percent, totaling 2,783,377.6 metric tons. Paraguay's

  [Text] Quito, 27 Jan (AFP) -- Colombia's Cali Cartel has 
expanded its operations into Ecuador, Colonel Telmo Erazo, 
director of investigations and Interpol liaison for the 
Ecuadoran police, stated here today. According to Erazo, 
Colombian narcotraffickers are using Ecuador as a bridge to ship 
cocaine into the international market. 
  "There are clues that the cartel is exerting influence in 
our 
country, and we are working to combat this," Erazo told newsmen. 
  The head of the counternarcotics squad does not dismiss that 
after the death of Pablo Escobar Gaviria, head of the Medellin 
Cartel, Cali's criminal organization has gained control of the 
drug business worldwide. 
  DEA reports indicate that the Cali Cartel is supplied with 
Peruvian and Bolivian cocaine paste, which is later processed in 
laboratories located in jungle regions of southern Colombia, 
especially in the Putumayo region along the Ecuadoran border. 
  The organization is also conducting large money laundering 
operations in Ecuador and in Venezuela, Chile, and Argentina, 
according to police spokesmen. 
  Over the past few days Ecuadoran, authorities have seized 
cocaine paste and cocaine hydrochloride, which were camouflaged 
in shipments bound for the United States and Europe. Several 
Spanish passengers, as well as passengers of other 
nationalities, presumably linked with drug trafficking, have 
been arrested in operations staged at the Guayaquil and Quito 
international airports.

  [Text] A terrorist attack which caused a blackout in a 
large part of Guatemala and diverse acts of violence contributed 
this Thursday to create a climate of unrest in the country. 
This has occurred on the eve of a public workers strike, which 
according to the strike promoters, will be joined by over 
200,000 workers. The uncertainty heightened in the wake of the 
decision by the Transportation Coordinating Board to paralyze 
activities this coming Tuesday. This measure could leave the 
country without a normal fuel supply during the strike. 
  The explosion that we mentioned earlier injured three 
persons 
who were identified as: Lydia Bolanos, 32; Carlos Bolanos, 35; 
and Ramon Hernandez, 32. Mrs. Bolanos is employed by the 
computer section of the National Police and happened to be 
passing by the area. The shrapnel scattered up to a radius of 
5 km, reaching the Kennedy and Galilea neighborhoods of Zone 18. 
[sentence as heard] 
  There were reports of other bomb explosions in the outlying 
part of the city, in Panorama neighborhood in the city of San 
Cristobal. 
  [Begin recording] [Volunteer firefighter Aguirre] Thus far 
we 
have received reports of three bomb blasts that occurred in Las 
Ilusiones neighborhood in Zone 18 where the electricity towers 
were damaged. Also, it was reported that another electricity 
tower was damaged on the Pacific highway at the 22-km marker. 
Our units were dispatched to the area and are searching for 
possible casualties. Also, we received a report of another bomb 
explosion in Panorama in the city of San Cristobal. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Aguirre, can you tell us if 
these 
bombs have caused any casualties? 
  [Aguirre] Yes, we learned that three persons injured in 
Ilusiones neighborhood were taken to the general hospital in 
Zone 6 for emergency treatment. 
  [Reporter] How badly were they injured? 
  [Aguirre] Up to the moment, we learned that they sustained 
cuts, bruises and injuries to several parts of their bodies. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Aguirre, can you tell us about a gasoline 
station on fire in Zone 11? 
  [Aguirre] Yes, at this moment units 29, 31, and 37 are 
trying 
to control a big fire on 16th Street in Zone 11. Thus far it is 
not known what caused the fire. [end recording]

  [Text] La Paz, 25 December (LOS TIEMPOS)--In his interview 
with LOS TIEMPOS Quiroga explained that the new strategy which 
was presented for the consideration of the international 
community in Washington seeks to consolidate two things. First, 
balancing alternative development with drug interdiction. 
Secondly, beginning in 1994, implementing the "zero option," 
that is, eliminating root and branch all "excess" plantings of 
coca leaves. 
  He said: "What we did during this first phase of the meeting 
of the Consultative Group of the World Bank for Bolivia was to 
ask for resources to study the feasibility or lack of it of this 
alternative." 
  In referring to the so-called "zero option" the minister 
indicated that this alternative has the objectives of completely 
eliminating excess plantings of coca leaves, seeking to 
industrialize the production areas, and promoting true centers 
of social and economic development in the Chapare and Yungas 
areas. Furthermore, it has the objective of providing an 
opportunity to productive peasant farmers "to choose the best 
alternative which suits their interests." 
  He pointed out: "We brought this kind of proposal to the 
international community and we are only waiting for an answer, 
which we consider will be positive, to begin studying the ways 
and means which could be used for the proper functioning of this 
strategy for the integrated development of the Chapare and 
Yungas areas." 
  According to Minister Quiroga, the total cost of the "zero 
option" will be about $1.2 billion. It has been provisionally 
estimated that its implementation, which is not a short- or 
medium-term matter, will take six years after the program is 
approved. 
  He said: "The first stage will cover studies for project 
implementation, which will require the expenditure of $100 
million to complete. The second phase is closely related to 
practical implementation of the program in the producing areas, 
with investments in the order of $900 million." 
  He noted: "This new proposal was developed to deal with 
inconsistencies in alternative development programs in the 
Chapare area of the Department of Cochabamba and the meager, 
positive results from their implementation five years ago." 
  As an example of the defects in these past programs he 
pointed out that in the Ivigarzama area a considerable number of 
plantings of coca leaves was eliminated. However, the programs 
and strategies of alternative development were not even "30 
percent implemented."

<F P=106> [Interview with Argentine President Carlos Menem by Fernando </F>
Laborda, Mauricio Carini, Jorge E. Elias, and Facundo Landivar 
on 27 December; place not given] 
  [Text] [LA NACION] The fate of the constitutional reform 
will be decided today in the Senate but there is a feeling that 
the subject of the reduction of mandates has reached a 
stalemate. What will happen if the senators do not approve the 
draft bill? 
  [Menem] Well, there will be no reform, what can we do... 
  [LA NACION] And if the draft bill is approved without the 
reduction of the terms to four years? 
  [Menem] The draft bill will have to go back to be reviewed 
by 
the Chamber of Deputies. 
  [LA NACION] Would this jeopardize the pact you signed with 
Alfonsin...? 
  [Menem] There is nothing we can do about it. We will try to 
see that the agreement is respected but that is as much as we 
can do. Alfonsin will give his representative instructions to 
respect the pact and we will follow suit. This method worked 
with the Chamber of Deputies. 
  [LA NACION] You maintain that what happens now is not up to 
you. With that same criteria some may believe that not even the 
conventioneers have the duty to flatly respect the pact. 
  [Menem] I believe the conventioneers will abide by the 
constitutional reform law. A pact between political parties, 
which is important, cannot prevail over the law. 
  [LA NACION] Is there any possibility that the conventioneers 
may go beyond what was agreed? 
  [Menem] There is no problem unless they distort the essence 
of the pact. Their actions will fall within the framework of a 
law approved by Congress. 
  [LA NACION] How much authority will a cabinet chief take 
away 
from the president? 
  [Menem] It is hard to talk about that figure until it has 
been completely defined. For a start, the president will loose 
no authority. If you look at the draft bill the Chamber of 
Deputies sent to the Senate you will see that the chief of 
state's power remains untouched. 
  [LA NACION] However, Alfonsin convinced radicalism of the 
advantages of the pact by arguing it would weaken the 
presidential power... 
  [Menem] I do not think this is the case. It is a matter of 
interpretation. If you look closely at the draft bill you will 
see that presidential power is not altered. 
  [LA NACION] Who do you think is the best candidate for 
cabinet chief? 
  [Menem] Sorry, but I cannot mention any names now. 
  [LA NACION] Could you describe the profile of person you 
would like. 
  [Menem] If I describe the profile you will publish it 
tomorrow. I already have a candidate in mind. 
  [LA NACION] Important business sectors fear the cabinet 
chief 
may curtail [Economy Minister Domingo] Cavallo's power... 
  [Menem] No, please, there is no such chance. 
  [LA NACION] Based on what you are saying, the function of 
that new post is just operational, administrative. 
  [Menem] That is the idea. The reform states that the 
president is the chief of state and the chief of the public 
administration. 
  [LA NACION] In other words, the cabinet chief will be 
another 
secretary general of the presidency... 
  [Menem] You are trying to get me to say that Eduardo Bauza 
will be chosen, but I will not. We must wait for the reform to 
be approved, it will still take some time. 
  [LA NACION] In conclusion, if the post will not help either 
above or below its own level, if it will not change the powers 
of ministers, and if it will merely fulfill functions that are 
already being fulfilled, why is it being included in the new 
Constitution? 
  [Menem] That is your interpretation, Dr. Alfonsin has his. 
  [LA NACION] What about yours? 
  [Menem] I believe it is advantageous. We have to wait and 
see how it works. 
  [LA NACION] Advantageous, but not necessary... 
  [Menem] Advantageous and necessary are more or less the 
same. 
I have managed so far, but I could do better with a cabinet 
chief. 
  [LA NACION] What will be the next steps in the reform? 
  [Menem] If things work, we will implement the new 
Constitution at the end of 1994 or at the beginning of 1995. 
The initial date for the election of constituent assembly 
delegates will be 20 March 
  [LA NACION] The Radicals were thinking of the end of April 
as 
the most advantageous date. Is this being negotiated? 
  [Menem] I suppose it is, but that is the date that I deem 
most advantageous, in order to gain time. 
  [LA NACION] If after the reform you are reelected, your term 
will last until 1999. Have you thought about what you will do 
after that? 
  [Menem] Well, I am not going to live for ever, but I will 
wait four years and I will run again. I will be 73, and I will 
be able to run. 
  [LA NACION] Is the impossibility of being reelected in 1999 
-- as you have repeatedly maintained -- a proscription? 
  [Menem] We would otherwise be thinking of permanent 
reelection. 
  [LA NACION] Like in La Rioja... 
  [Menem] But not at a national level. France, Spain, and 
several other countries, however, do allow it. 
  [LA NACION] Aside from personal interest, what do you think 
of permanent reelection? 
  [Menem] It is very difficult to say, but large countries 
have 
their reasons for adopting it. It cannot be dangerous, because 
it is not dangerous for those nations. 
  [LA NACION] Some sectors fear that after the reform is 
approved, people will insist that you can again run in 1999. 
  [Menem] No, please. The pact is very clear. I don't think 
anyone will insist on it in 1999. 
  [LA NACION] What is your opinion of 1993. 
  [Menem] Compared to other years this has been the best. Not 
just because I say so, but because of what the great majority in 
the country thinks so and because of the place Argentina has 
conquered internationally. According to budget predictions, we 
will also see excellent growth in 1994. 
  Resources will increase for basic areas in which the state 
must be present: education, culture, justice, safety, and public 
health. There is a good chance that investments will also 
continue to grow, that greater credits may be granted to the 
productive sector -- especially for medium-sized and small 
enterprises. There is also the new social security law. The 
national government is constantly searching, based on a sound 
law, to lower production costs -- a task in which some private 
sectors are also involved. The 1994 panorama is really 
promising. 
  Moreover, people should also be aware that never in the 
history of the Argentine Republic has the cabinet of the 
president of the Nation successfully fulfilled the task of 
reforming the state apparatus, with a punctuality only 
interrupted by my trips abroad. We meet once a week. I think 
this has never happened since Argentina became institutionalized 
in 1853. The cabinet meets weekly either in the Federal Capital 
or in the provinces. 
  [LA NACION] Will the efforts of the government in 1994 be 
focused on any specific area? 
  [Menem] Yes. In cultural, educational, scientific, and 
technological areas. 
  [LA NACION] Any special reason? 
  [Menem] If we do not step up government actions in the 
cultural field, like great countries do, we will probably be 
unable to maintain the growth rate that has made Argentina the 
country with the greatest growth, together with China and 
Thailand, in the world. Argentina has the greatest growth in the 
Western hemisphere but this must be matched with education, 
culture, science, and technology. 
  As [President Domingo] Sarmiento used to say: Argentina's 
problems are mainly of an educational nature. 
  [LA NACION] Are there any specific projects for this field? 
  [Menem] They are being elaborated. People are constantly 
working in this direction. The education sector will soon 
disclose the achievements of the past few years, especially of 
1993. Comparing the 1992 and 1993 budgets, the cultural sector's 
funds increased by 60 percent. For 1994 we are calculating a 
27-percent increase of resources for this field. 
  [LA NACION] Will there be a cabinet reshuffle in the near 
future? It has been said time and again that [Health] Minister 
[Alberto] Mazza may leave. 
  [Menem] He has not yet told me anything about that and he is 
busily engaged in many activities. I reiterate what I have 
always said: Those who do not agree with the president are not 
obliged to remain in their posts. The cabinet continues for the 
time being unchanged. 
  [LA NACION] Apart from Justice Minister Jorge Maiorano, who 
could become the next ombudsman. 
  [Menem] That has yet to be settled, but the ombudsman is 
nominated by the Senate not by the president. If this 
appointment does not materialize, Dr. Maiorano will continue at 
the head of the Justice Ministry. 
  [LA NACION] What will you say to pensioners at the start of 
the year? 
  [Menem] The same old answer; namely that there are no 
financial resources and that we cannot make empty promises. 
Besides, how many are going to demonstrate against the 
government? There are 4 million pensioners who receive health 
allowances, free medicines, dental prostheses, and tourism 
trips. There are 4 million of them compared with the 100 or 200 
who demonstrate, strike blows, and hit policemen... 
  [LA NACION] With regard to the expenditures incurred to 
refurbish the Olivos presidential residence... 
  [Menem] Now, now, there are other more important things to 
publish. We had to refurbish the house so as to be able to move 
there. It was redone as was appropriate. Besides, this is not 
for me, personally, it belongs to the federal government. 
  We had to have the house redone because it was in a shocking 
state of repair -- the kitchen, bathrooms, laundry, and guard 
quarters. Let us make it clear, however, that the house is not 
being added to, we are only refurbishing it. The only addition 
-- the tennis court -- was donated. 
  [LA NACION] An important query about the 1995 elections is 
who will be your running mate. Would you like to have the same 
ticket as in 1989? 
  [Menem] That is a possibility among the many that are open 
to 
us. A profile like that of Duhalde is excellent. 
  [LA NACION] Which one is more appealing to you; a politician 
or a technocrat? 
  [Menem] I will always take a politician over a technocrat 
because when the president is on leave or travels abroad, his 
duties must be handled by a politician. A technocrat may hold 
other posts, but not as a running mate. 
  [LA NACION] How about your brother Eduardo, is he a 
technocrat or a politician? 
  [Menem] He is both a technocrat and a politician. He has 
always been engaged in his profession, studying and, at the same 
time, growing into a politician. Nobody can question his skills 
in the field of law as well as in politics. 
  [LA NACION] Could he be your running mate? 
  [Menem] No, no. One should at all costs avoid making 
mistakes. 
  [LA NACION] Within the framework of the constitutional 
reform, much has been said about changing the number of 
ministries. Does this idea still hold good? 
  [Menem] I think that the number of ministries ought to be 
increased from eight to at least 12. We are thinking about 
creating a Science and Technology Ministry, an Environment 
Ministry, and two others. 
  [LA NACION] Like the Production Ministry, for example? 
  [Menem] Yes, we are discussing the possibility of dividing 
the Economy Ministry into the Economy Ministry and the 
Production Ministry. We have not yet ruled out this possibility. 
  [LA NACION] Does the appointment of Caro Figueroa as labor 
minister hint that the government will encourage the passing of 
the labor reform? 
  [Menem] Yes, that is a subject on which the new minister has 
already been working. 
  [LA NACION] The president blamed leftist groups for the 
outbreak in Santiago del Estero. He was quick to say: "Not all 
are leftists but there are some radical sectors who are 
obviously involved in this game." 
  During the interview, Carlos Menem gave an example when he 
said: "Some of the graffiti in Buenos Aires states: Yesterday 
the Santiago outbreak, today the Argentine outbreak. This is 
signed by the MAS [Movement Toward Socialism]. Well... no one 
in his right mind would set Government House, the legislature, 
or the justice building on fire just to demand his salary 
payment. What interest could there be for a demonstrator to 
destroy historic buildings? This was not the work of the people 
of Santiago del Estero but of agitators, of subversives. [no 
closing quotation marks as published] 
  So, what is your interpretation? 
  [Menem] I saw people with their faces completely covered. No 
ones goes like that to a public demonstration. At a one time a 
pick-up was overturned and set on fire, and the people said that 
they were not part of the demonstration. They asked the police 
to stop them but the police, acting in a hurry or for some other 
reason, reacted against the people. There were agitators or 
infiltrators who took advantage of the situation. 
  [LA NACION] Do you have any indication who they may be? 
  [Menem] It is being investigated. 
  [LA NACION] The impression is that they took advantage of a 
favorable situation. 
  [Menem] That is right, but who is provoking them. They are 
the ones with their faces covered. This cannot be justified. 
Like that, maybe tomorrow or the day after they can burn 
another city. 
  [LA NACION] Does the government fear that this may happen in 
another province? 
  [Menem] No, no. We will completely prevent this type of 
situation. 
  [LA NACION] What is your opinion on a confidential report by 
the Side [Secretariat for State Intelligence] that was made 
public indicating the lack of infrastructure in the provinces to 
stop possible outbreaks? 
  [Menem] It is completely inaccurate. I would even say that 
the legitimacy of that report can be discarded. What are the 
words you reporters use in this case? Rotten, right? I would 
rather say it is a false report. 
  [LA NACION] Who released it? 
  [Menem] I have no idea. It is always good to look for the 
reasons for publishing a report like that. What good would a 
false report do to the government? Nothing. 
  [LA NACION] Apart from reducing social security 
contributions 
for management staff, is the government planning other measures 
to reduce labor cost? 
  [Menem] Reductions should also be made by the private 
sector. 
It is not right for the government to do it alone. For example, 
private banks should lower their operational costs. 
  [LA NACION] Will the state help provinces that have major 
problems? 
  [Menem] Of course. We are already providing money for 
severance pay based on funds obtained from international 
organizations. 
  [LA NACION] Is there a determined amount? 
  [Menem] There is no determined amount but we are talking 
about 150 to 200 million pesos. The Inter-American Development 
Bank gave about $3 billion this year for different areas, 
especially for projects against floods in Corrientes, Misiones 
and Entre Rios, and other zones. 
  [LA NACION] What will happen with the provinces that oppose 
the Fiscal Pact? 
  [Menem] They will not have the benefits of the Fiscal Pact. 
  [LA NACION] Do you plan to meet with the governors? 
  [Menem] Between 18 and 20 January in Mar del Plata.

<F P=106> [Report by Special Correspondent Marcia Carmo] </F>
  [Text] Leticia, Colombia -- President Itamar Franco 
believes the country should carefully follow the developments of 
the trial of legislators involved in mishandling the budget. He 
added he is willing to investigate within the executive branch 
should the situation demand it. The president will carefully 
review the final budget CPI [Congressional Investigating 
Committee] report and submit it to the civilian cabinet to 
verify if it is necessary to investigate the Executive Branch. 
  After stating that the executive branch cooperated with the 
CPI investigations by providing information requested by its 
members, the president said: "If the situation requires it, we 
will continue the investigation through the Special 
Investigating Commission." Established by the president to 
investigate irregularities in the Executive Branch, the Special 
Investigating Commission will be installed either on the 25 or 
26 January. It will be headed by Federal Administration 
Secretary (SAF) Romildo Cahim. It comprises, among others, 
members of the Ethics in Politics Movement. 
  Itamar Franco is satisfied with the CPI works that have 
concluded but he believes the issuance of the CPI final report 
will mark the beginning of an investigation into the mishandling 
of the public budget. He said: "Congress did what had to be 
done," adding: "Of course, this is only one stage. It will 
continue through the Senate and Chamber of Deputies justice 
commissions and joint sessions of Congress." 
  On his way back from Leticia, a town on the 
Brazilian-Colombian border where he attended the installation of 
the Brazilian-Colombian Neighborhood Commission, the president 
said the Executive Branch will continue to submit all requested 
information to help clarify the mishandling of the budget. 
  "Our cooperation can be confirmed by any CPI member" he said 
between sips of mineral water. He did not want to comment on 
whether the Judicial Branch will follow the example of the 
Legislative Branch and investigate its own activities. "The 
Judicial Branch is a different government entity," he said. 
  During the interview with JORNAL DO BRASIL, the president 
said he will meet with Pedro Simon (PMDB-RS) [Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party-Rio Grande do Sul], the government 
leader in the Senate; and Luiz Carlos Santos (PMDB-SP) [Sao 
Paulo], government leader in the Chamber of Deputies, to discuss 
the appointment of the new mines and energy minister. Itamar 
Franco will chose the successor to Deputy Paulino Cicero 
(PSDB-MG) [Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Mato Grosso], who 
left his post to run in the elections. He declined to comment 
on whether former Civilian Cabinet Minister Henrique Hargreaves 
will be appointed.

  [Text] Brasilia -- President Itamar Franco took advantage 
of his meeting with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo 
last week to insist on the need for establishing the South 
American Free Trade Zone, a proposal he made last year before 
the Rio Group meeting held in Chile, and which strives to group 
together the ten member countries of ALADI (Latin American 
Integration Association). In assessing his trip to Leticia, a 
Colombian town near the Brazilian border, President Franco told 
JORNAL DO BRASIL that "Colombia is an important partner." 
Moreover, Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, who accompanied Franco 
in his trip to Leticia, said: "Through a free-trade zone we 
would be able to negotiate under better terms with other trade 
groups, such as NAFTA." 
  Franco and Gaviria installed the Brazilian-Colombian 
Neighborhood Commission, which will be entrusted with finding 
solutions to problems concerning the fight against narcotics, 
environmental protection, and the adoption of measures to 
improve health and education conditions and assist Amazonian 
indigenous groups. 
  The ideas is to expedite negotiations with Colombia before 
Gaviria leaves the presidency. Colombia is holding presidential 
elections at the end of the first half of this year, and Gaviria 
will be running for the OAS General Secretariat. The proposal 
to establish a South American Free Trade Zone (comprised of the 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South] countries Brazil, 
Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay; Chile; and the five Andean 
Group member countries Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia) was 
also discussed at the Mercosur presidential summit held in 
Colonia, Uruguay last week.

  [Excerpt] The government will cease to be a mere observer 
of the constitutional reform issue and take the initiative, 
seeking to initiate reforms. The PFL [Liberal Front Party] has 
managed to convince Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso 
that revisions are in the best interest of the government. 
After lunching with Fernando Henrique last week, Marco Maciel 
(PE) [Pernambuco State] -- the PFL bloc leader in the Senate -- 
and Deputy Luis Eduardo Magalhaes (BA) [Bahia State] -- the PFL 
bloc leader in the Chamber of Deputies -- believe the government 
is the newest ally of the revisionists who are struggling for 
votes now. 
  Maciel told JORNAL DO BRASIL yesterday afternoon: "We now 
have a very important partner, namely the government." During 
their lunch, the PFL leaders explained the importance of the 
revision for the government's economic program. Neither the 
fiscal adjustment nor the 1994 budget will be approved without 
constitutional changes that necessarily involve a reform. The 
senator claimed: "It is essential to begin the revision this 
week." He guaranteed: "The minister totally agrees with this 
point of view." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Deputy for Piaui Jose Luis Maia yesterday resigned 
his post as leader of the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] in the 
Chamber of Deputies. He stopped discharging his duties at the 
beginning of the work by the budget CPI [Congressional 
Investigating Committee]. "I am tired, I have lived through a 
period of embitterment during the work by the CPI, and I must 
now rebuild my image before my supporters," he said in 
justifying his resignation. He added, however, that in addition 
to working with his grassroots he will use his time to prepare 
his defense for the investigation that the Chamber's supervisor 
[corregedoria] will conduct in light of the conclusions of the 
CPI report. 
  Despite the fact that the CPI did not punish him with the 
cancellation of his mandate, the faction of the PPR bloc that is 
promoting a renewal has questioned his leadership. His 
resignation will facilitate the process. The PPR leadership is 
being exercised by Deputy for Porto Alegre Gerson Peres, the 
first deputy leader. He will summon a bloc meeting to debate the 
election of the new leader next week. The candidates are: 
Gerson Peres, Marcelino Romano (Sao Paulo), and Jose Lourenco 
(Bahia).

  [Text] Manaus -- PT [Workers Party] President and virtual 
presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva yesterday 
announced that he will meet with the three military ministers by 
April at the latest. He made this announcement during a visit 
to General Jose Sampaio Maia, the Amazonas military commander. 
According to Lula's advisers, the PT candidate's first formal 
meeting with a military commander lasted 105 minutes, and 
addressed "problems of the Amazonas." 
  Lula said he intends to expedite the meetings with the 
military sector in order to become better acquainted with the 
situation of the military, and to complete the program of 
government proposed by the PT. After his meeting with the 
Amazonas military commander, Lula was enthusiastic about the 
receptivity he found within the military. In exchange for this, 
he advocated a stronger military presence in the Amazonas: "It 
is necessary to give the Armed Forces a good structure to 
maintain the security of our borders and continue with their 
positive policy of presence in the area," he said.

  [Text] Justice Minister Mauricio Correa believes it would 
be "beneficial" if the Judicial Branch took the initiative of 
promoting a self-examination, following the example set by the 
Legislative Branch. Taking a break during the presidential 
visit to Leticia, [a Colombian city] on the Brazilian border, 
Correa stressed: "There is a nationwide phenomenon, seeking 
purity and clarity in public affairs." He mused: "The Judicial 
Branch judges citizens. If they were to conduct an 
investigation, an inquest ..." 
  In Brasilia, Senator Jarbas Passarinho (PPR-PA) [Progressive 
Renewal Party-Para State], the chairman of the budget CPI 
[Congressional Investigating Committee], endorsed the idea of a 
"self-examination" by the Judicial Branch, but reminded that 
this branch has considered such a proposal offensive. 
  Passarinho noted: "If we want Brazil to bathe in ethics, it 
should not just take place in the Legislative Branch." He added 
that the Judicial Branch auditing office [corregedoria] should 
operate more clearly and thus facilitate monitoring by public 
opinion. He complained: "The Brazilian judicial system operates 
like a corporation." 
  Minister Mauricio Correa stated that the three branches are 
independent and that the formation of a commission to 
investigate probable irregularities in the Judicial Branch would 
have to be decided by the courts themselves. Recalling the 
irregularities committed the INSS [National Social Security 
Institute] judges, Correa said: "Such an initiative would be 
welcomed by society." Mauricio Correa emphasized that, as a 
senator, he favors the formation of a commission outside the 
Judicial Branch to control it, adding that he has not considered 
it in the name of the government.

  [Text] Sao Paulo -- Mayor Paulo Maluf believes Senator 
Jarbas Passarinho (PPR-PA [Progressive Renewal Party-Para]) is 
"a great candidate for the presidency of the Republic because he 
is the only Brazilian who has been minister four times -- in the 
labor, education, social welfare, and justice portfolios." Maluf 
avoided talking about his own possible candidacy for Planalto 
Palace, preferring instead to commend the president of the CPI 
[Congressional Investigating Committee] on the budget scandal, 
stressing that Passarinho was elected senator three times, and 
Para State governor and Congress president. 
  "Very few people in this country have Passarinho's political 
background. If our party chooses him as a candidate, he will win 
the election. He is austere and competent," Maluf said, without 
explaining what that would do to his candidacy. "It is the party 
that will decide who the candidate will be. If the party chooses 
Passarinho, I will campaign for him morning, afternoon, and 
night." 
<H5>  Carnival </H5>
  Asked how he would take it if the PPR chose him as 
presidential candidate instead of Passarinho, Maluf said: "The 
problem is undefined because I did not tell the party that I 
wanted to become a candidate." 
  Recalling the lyrics of Chico Buarque of Holland's song, 
Maluf said he is getting ready "for the arrival of carnival." 
The mayor said he will make a decision on an eventual candidacy 
after February. "We still are in January. Let us wait for 
February. People say that Brazilian history begins after 
carnival." 
<H5>  Lula [Inacio Lula da Silva] </H5>
  Maluf avoided attacking Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, 
with whom he participated in a luncheon at the house of actress 
and former Deputy Ruth Escobar on 23 January. His criticism was 
once again directed at Lula. "I think Lula is inadequate to 
become president. First he should be a candidate to San Bernardo 
City Hall. He should be a mayor for four years and then he 
should be a gubernatorial candidate. If he is a good governor 
for four years he could become a presidential candidate. He does 
not have the executive experience to become president," Maluf 
said. 
  In Maluf's opinion, "the PT [Workers Party] should elect 
Mercadante (Deputy Aloizio Mercadante) who is a university 
professor and has experience, or even [Luiza] Erundina, who 
already has been [Sao Paulo State] governor."

  [Editorial Report] Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in 
Portuguese carries in its 25 January edition, on page 7, three 
unattributed articles about Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos de 
Magalhaes' actions to become a presidential candidate. 
  The first 250-word article states: "Although he guarantees 
that his main priority is to run for a Senate seat for the 
Liberal Front Party, PFL, Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos 
Magalhaes, yesterday admitted for the first time during a 
luncheon held for him by the Rio de Janeiro Businessmen 
Association that he may run as a candidate for the presidency of 
the Republic. `I will continue crafting an alliance for the 
first voting round with all the parties whose candidates may 
withdraw. My name is available, but I would be the sixth option 
because I also defend five other candidates,' Magalhaes said 
before 200 businessmen, including Globo Companies' Roberto 
Marinho, his longtime friend." 
  In a second 200-word article describing his speech to the 
Rio 
businessmen, Magalhaes harshly criticizes the economic policy of 
Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Magalhaes states: 
"The fiscal reform that the government wants to pass will not 
yield any results. It will only increase taxes for you. The 
government is not brave enough to say that the Real Value Unit, 
URV, is a disguised dollarization of the economy that will 
create salary problems like in Argentina and Mexico." Magalhaes 
continues by saying that the government needs a "credibility 
shock," which for him means an "effective fight against 
corruption and tax evaders, and an immediate constitutional 
revision. `We need a strong government and a return to the 
principle of authority,'" Magalhaes said. 
  The third 250-word article describes Magalhaes as a 
political 
chess master who, although he seems to be warming up the seat 
for another candidate, is really doing it for himself. His 
speeches gain more media coverage than the Citizenry Caravan 
carried out by opponent Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. The article 
states that the other presidential candidates, Jose Sarney, 
Orestes Quercia, and Paulo Maluf, are morally discredited, while 
Antonio Britto finds strong resistance within his own party. The 
candidacy of Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso depends 
on whether he can control inflation; otherwise his party will 
have to support Senator Mario Covas. Considering this, Magalhaes 
is launching himself as the "sixth option."

<F P=106> [Article by Marcia Carmo from Leticia, Colombia] </F>
  [Text] Brazil had a withholding of about 600,000 sacks of 
coffee in its stores last week. This will cause coffee prices 
to rise on the international market. A Brazilian and Colombian 
ministerial meeting was held on 22 January during President 
Itamar Franco's visit to Leticia, Colombia. The Brazilian 
Government reported that stocks of coffee in its 20 leading 
cooperatives amounted to 629,000 sacks, which is more than the 
required 20 percent withholding established by the Association 
of Coffee Producing Countries (APPC). 
  This information was disclosed by Ailton Barcelos, the 
acting 
industry, commerce, and tourism minister. He said the news 
caused "euphoria" among the Colombians -- who are the 
administrators of the APPC, which groups together 33 countries. 
He said the price of a sack of coffee plunged from $70 to $45 
during the last four years. 
  He estimated that the information provided by Brazil, which 
is the group leader, will prompt coffee producers to increase 
the price from $0.74 the pound to $0.85. Barcelos said: "This 
would have an extraordinary international impact." 
  Barcelos will hand over his portfolio tomorrow to Senator 
Elcio Alvares (PFL-ES) [Liberal Front Party-Espirito Santo], but 
will remain at the Industry, Commerce, and Tourism Ministry as 
executive secretary. He recalled that in the fourth quarter of 
1993, Brazil failed to keep its commitment to withhold 20 
percent of its coffee production. 
  Brazil exported 3,913 sacks during that quarter and, in 
keeping with the agreement signed with the APPC, should have 
withheld 20 percent to trigger a rise in coffee prices. Owing 
to the absence of a reliable information system, Brazil thought 
it had failed to honor its commitment with the international 
market, but a survey last week confirmed that there is more than 
enough in stock to meet the required withholding. "In other 
words, we are honoring our international commitments."

  [Text] Havana, 26 Jan (PL) -- During the second day of 
discussions at the Fourth Latin American and Caribbean Meeting 
for Solidarity, the National Assembly of the People's Government 
warned that Cuba faces an unbending, systematic, and stubborn 
campaign of aggression from the United States. 
  A statement issued by the Standing Committee on Foreign 
Relations, which circulated today among the delegates, 
reaffirmed this fact cannot be ignored by anyone "honestly 
interested in helping the Cuban people overcome the current 
situation." 
  It points out that "no country in Latin America has ever 
been 
subjected to such overwhelming pressure, or withstood the 
hostility that Cuba continues to suffer, even though the Cold 
War is supposed to be over." 
  The communique states the Caribbean island is living under a 
partial military blockade, even though top U.S. political 
leaders have rule out a possible military intervention before 
the international community. 
  It states the U.S. Armed Forces have created a plan around 
Cuba that would allow them -- with the use of tactical aviation, 
aircraft carriers, and cruise missiles launched from air and sea 
platforms -- to deal a hard blow in a short period of time, by 
surprise or not, against important Cuban military, political, 
and economic targets. 
  It adds the search for information on this country continues 
to be one of the U.S. intelligence community's main priorities. 
  According to a legislative study, a total of 88 flights with 
radio electronic reconnaissance planes of various types were 
made up through 31 October 1993. In 1992, only 114 flights took 
place. 
  After recalling that the Guantanamo naval station is not 
important to the United States in a strategical and military 
sense, the communique points out that the station was reinforced 
with ships during the first six months of 1993 and that, by 
year's end, the government of President Bill Clinton had ordered 
a new deployment of power given the Haitian situation. 
  The Assembly also reported that the CIA's cover-operations, 
which include attacks, sabotage, simulated self-inflicted 
aggression, etc., and the CIA's support for terrorist groups 
that openly operate from U.S. territory violate the Neutrality 
Act. 
  According to the legislative commission, despite statements 
by State Department officials that the government would not 
allow that document to be violated, work being done by terrorist 
organizations of Cuban origin in the United States is publicly 
evident. 
  Another paragraph of the declaration charges that a frenetic 
radio offensive, which is justified on the alleged principle of 
free flow of information, is being unleashed at this time 
against the Caribbean island under Washington's protection.

<F P=106> [Report by Elsy Fors] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 25 Jan (PL) -- Under the banner of 
indispensable unity and continental integration, the fourth 
Latin American and Caribbean meeting got under way with the 
presence of President Fidel Castro and 1,000 delegates from all 
the countries of the region. 
  Indian leaders, politicians, intellectuals, professionals, 
and believers of the most varied religions of all the countries 
of the hemisphere, including the United States and Canada, have 
heeded the summons to this meeting for the solidarity, 
sovereignty, self- determination, and lives of our peoples. 
  The Cuban president, who heads the host delegation, received 
the acclamation of the participants at the meeting, which will 
conclude on Friday, 28 January. 
  Representatives from previous host countries of the forum -- 
Ecuador, Colombia, and Brazil -- spoke during the inaugural 
session and concurred in calling for the unity of regional 
progressive forces, the integration of their countries, and 
solidarity with Cuba. 
  Camilo Restrepo of Ecuador referred to the extremely grave 
economic situation of the majority of the Latin American 
population, where poverty is on the increase due to the effects 
of neoliberal economic policies. 
  In turn, Colombian Ivan Foredo said those attending this 
meeting were the genuine heirs of Latin America's struggle for 
liberty, and he called on them to speak out against the inhuman 
U.S. blockade against Cuba, who maintains, he added, the 
socialist program more than ever. 
  Amir Lando, senator for the Brazilian Democratic Movement 
Party, stated solidarity stresses the need to be organized. We 
have the capacity and the duty, he stated, to make our 
convictions reach our peoples. 
  The Brazilian legislator compared Cuban health indicators to 
Brazil's, where the life expectancy is 58 years in comparison to 
75 years in Cuba, and where the infant mortality rate is 69 for 
very 1,000 live births as opposed to 9.5 in Cuba. 
  Regarding the Brazilian experience in the implementation of 
neoliberal adjustments, Lando said the privatization process, 
far from replacing state enterprises with a policy of 
development, had exchanged state monopolies for private business 
monopolies that take away the country's wealth. 
  Jose Ramon Balaguer, Politburo member of the Communist Party 
of Cuba and head of the Ideological Department, spoke on behalf 
of Cuba, stressing the complex international panorama in which 
the meeting is being held. 
  He indicated a decade of changes born under an adverse sign 
of unipolar power began not long ago. He noted that within this 
context, Cuba feels capable of making its own alternatives. 
  Referring to the difficult economic situation in the 
country, 
Balaguer said the road to recovery has begun, albeit slowly, 
mostly because of the impact of the U.S. embargo, which has 
lasted more than three decades. 
  The Cuban leader called on the participants to strive for 
unity because there will be no future without unity and 
integration. This afternoon, the forum is expected to begin 
debating in four commissions, namely, political, economic, 
cultural, and organizational commissions. On 27 January, groups 
will contact unions, Indians, women, religious groups, community 
organizations, friendship and solidarity with Cuba associations, 
intellectuals, artists, and legislators. On Friday, the 
participants will return to the plenum where they will report on 
the work done by the committees and close the meeting with a 
party at the Panamerican Villa, east of Havana.

<F P=106> [Article by Moises Perez Mock] </F>
  [Text] Havana [dateline as received] -- Without 1994 
looking like a period of special perspectives for a change in 
the relations between Havana and Washington -- according to 
Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina -- the recurring topic 
today has renewed standing. 
  Recent revelations from Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, one of the 
historical leaders of the revolutionary process, regarding 
failed negotiations for the solution of the dispute, have 
brought to the table this affair, which was broadly discussed by 
local specialists over recent times. 
  The accusations that on 25 May 1978 then U.S. President 
James 
Carter leveled against Cuba for alleged participation in the 
attack by Katanguese troops on the Province of Shaba in southern 
Zaire, shattered the possible start in New York of the Cuba-U.S. 
dialogue. 
  According to Rodriguez, he was to hold a secret meeting that 
day with Secretary of State Cyrus Vance to begin the search for 
a solution to the crisis between the two governments, which at 
that time was already two decades old. 
  "That battle -- he said -- ended with the clarification of 
the truth: Cuba had not participated whatsoever in the 
adventure (in that African country), but the opportunity to 
start negotiations had passed." 
  Three lusters after the failed negotiation attempt, Rafael 
Hernandez, head of the Inter-American Relations Department at 
the nongovernmental American Studies Center (CEA), is one who 
believes that the regional situation is very favorable for 
normalization of the ties between Cuba and the United States. 
  The Latin American countries have gradually improved -- 
since 
the beginning of the 70's -- their relations with the island, 
the majority recognize Cuba's determination for national 
independence and sovereignty and even advise that Washington's 
policy hinders international free trade and is counterproductive 
and harmful for the Cuban people, he says. 
  In his article "Learning From the Cold War: The U.S. Policy 
Towards Cuba and Vietnam," which recently appeared in the 
CUADERNOS DE NUESTRA AMERICA magazine, the analyst remembers 
that even today Cuban exiles interfere in the adoption of a 
rational policy by Washington toward Havana. 
  The most dramatic impact of a new U.S. policy toward Cuba 
would be precisely on the conduct of the U.S.-Cuban community, 
he warns. 
  In a panel discussion held in mid-December 1993, on the 15th 
anniversary of the CEA, the investigator returned to the subject 
and spoke about the possible solution of the conflict between 
the two countries. 
  The analysis -- he said back then -- must start from two 
basic premises: The impossibility of sidelining the 
antagonistic interests and values that separate Cuba and the 
United States (beyond the greater or lesser will for a 
diplomatic arrangement) and the fact that the accounting of 
costs and benefits in a general scenario of negotiation is not 
to be reduced to something as simple as balancing a checkbook. 
  According to his criteria, the main cost Washington will 
have 
for mending its diplomatic agenda with Havana is dealing with 
attitudes and predispositions established over three decades in 
the security and foreign relations organizations and in Congress. 
  Also, [Washington] will have to recognize the Cuban 
Government in fact and by law and return to Cuban sovereignty 
the Guantanamo Naval Base, a naval and aerial resource in the 
Caribbean it has held for almost a century. 
  However, he adds, that last action will allow an improvement 
in the relations and an exploration of forms of constructive 
coexistence between the armed forces of the two countries and 
will ease -- in fact -- cooperation in topics such as the 
struggle against drug trafficking, naval and aerial security, 
among others. 
  Other benefits the White House could obtain at the 
negotiating table are the awakening of a political basis of 
interest groups -- especially economic -- which up to now do not 
work as lobbies [previous word in English] due to the rigidity 
of the U.S. policy toward the island. 
  Also, the total or partial lifting of the blockade will 
benefit the U.S. private sector and eliminate a point of discord 
with Latin America and several industrialized countries and a 
tense topic in the deliberations of international organizations. 
  The solution of the conflict with the northern neighbor 
means 
for Cuba immediate benefits: The mere reduction of the 
hostility favors its national interests, makes possible access 
to new markets and the flow of capital, and broadens the surface 
of bilateral contact. 
  However, rapprochement with the United States also has costs 
for Cuba, says Hernandez. 
  In the first place, the rapprochement between the two 
countries, although seen as necessary in purely economic terms, 
may divide national consensus on the political and ideological 
planes at a time when cohesion is of strategic importance. 
  Also, the presumed irruption of U.S. capital in the Cuban 
economy -- amid a process of reforms -- could be 
counterproductive. 
  That, without ruling out the possibility that Washington may 
seek to influence the business community with regard to Cuba by 
counseling or tutoring the monetary flow so as to favor 
determined political processes. 
  In any event, the topic of U.S.-Cuban dialogue is currently 
moving only in the field of speculation. 
  Cuba, recently said Foreign Minister Robaina, cannot decide 
whether it will make changes in those ties, because its 
definitions have already been established and it is Washington 
who has to alter its policy.

  [Text] Brussels, 26 Jan (PL) -- The need to promote greater 
economic cooperation between Cuba and the European Union [EU] 
was emphasized today by Ricardo Alarcon, president of the Cuban 
National Assembly, during a meeting with leaders of the European 
Parliament. 
  Alarcon, who is heading a Cuban delegation that began a 
visit 
to Belgium on Sunday, met this afternoon with the Foreign 
Economic Affairs Commission of the European Parliament headed by 
Belgian Liberal Deputy Willy de Clerq. 
  During the meeting, De Clerq expressed the European 
Parliament's interest in increasing contacts with Cuba. He 
noted that he was one of the supporters of a resolution that 
rejected the U.S. blockade, which was approved at the European 
Parliament plenary meeting in Strasbourg last September. 
  During an extensive, lengthy debate on various topics, the 
visitor stressed the need to expand cooperation and trade 
relations between Cuba and the EU and between Havana and the 
member-states of that supranational organization. 
  Alarcon also met with Egon Klepsch, chairman of the European 
Parliament, who expressed interest in the current situation in 
Cuba, especially the economic reforms now taking place. 
  At both meetings he underscored the importance that any 
economic measure to be adopted in the current circumstances in 
Cuba should have the broadest consensus of the people, who have 
been the basic historic backbone of the Cuban project. 
  Among other activities, the Cuban leader attended a dinner 
with Belgian businessmen in which the new product line of Cohiba 
1492 was presented by the Sutter Co. -- the Havana cigar 
distributor in the Benelux nations. 
  Ramon Pez Ferro, secretary of the Foreign Relations Standing 
Committee of the National Assembly of the People's Government, 
and Rosario Navas, Cuban ambassador to Belgium and the EU, 
participated in today's meeting. 
  Alarcon will stay in Belgium until 30 January. During his 
stay, he will meet with representatives of the Belgian 
Government, the parliament, and European political groups and 
friendship with Cuba associations.

  [Text] Brussels, 24 January (PL) -- Ricardo Calderon, 
Cuban National Assembly president, met with European Parliament 
and government leaders on the first day of his visit to Belgium. 
  Alarcon's full schedule included an interview with Frank 
Swaelen, head of the Belgian Senate, to whom Alarcon expressed 
the great appreciation of the Cuban Government for Belgium's 
vote in favor of the UN resolution against the U.S. blockade of 
Cuba. 
  Alarcon also met with Enrique Baron, president of the 
European Parliament Foreign Relations Committee, to discuss an 
eventual agreement for cooperation between the European Union 
[EU] and Cuba. 
  Calderon also spoke with Andre Louis, vice president of 
Christian Democratic International, and with Wilfred Maartens, 
head of the European Peoples Party and the Christian Democratic 
European Union. 
  The participants of both meetings discussed the situation in 
Cuba -- especially the economic changes taking place on the 
island -- the U.S. blockade, and the role of Europe and the EU 
in Cuba's current situation. 
  The board of directors of the European Parliament's 
department responsible for relations with Central America, 
Mexico, and Cuba, hosted a dinner in Alarcon's honor later the 
same evening. 
  Ramon Pez Ferro, International Relations Commission 
secretary 
of the Cuban parliament, and Rosario Navas, Cuban ambassador to 
Belgium, also participated in today's meetings. 
  Alarcon arrived last night at the head of a Cuban delegation 
and will remain in Brussels until 30 January to meet with 
organizations that support Cuba. 
  As a result of these groups' initiative, Cuban Economist 
Carlos Tablada will host a conference on 29 January, and 
singer/composer Silvio Rodriguez will give a concert.

  [Text] Havana, 15 Jan (PL) -- Cuban Defense Minister Raul 
Castro has said that the most beautiful battle the people can 
win is to avoid war, which would be their greatest victory. 
  Even so, he described as positive the preparation, 
patriotism, and courage of the armies, Armed Forces in general, 
the militias, and the people of the island, who are capable of 
facing an enemy that is superior in forces and defeating it. 
  During a meeting to assess the Central Army, a meeting that 
concluded yesterday in Cienfuegos Province, in central Cuba, the 
commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR) praised the 
stability of that command and the effort made in 1993 preparing 
to defend the national territory. 
  He referred to the progress made by the troops in that part 
of the nation with regard to the maintenance and esprit de corps 
of combat techniques and weapons, with more than 1.8 million 
items being maintained (tanks and all kinds of weapons, 
including gas masks). 
  He recommended that a similar effort be made with farm, 
construction, and other equipment, equipment that cost millions 
of dollars. He added that this equipment is now idle due of the 
lack of fuel or spare parts resulting from the economic crisis 
Cuba is experiencing. 
  Castro praised the progress made in the plans to build 
people's tunnels, set up caves and other engineering projects 
whose implementation respond to a Cuban military theory of "war 
by the entire people" which involves the training of the 
population and the creation of conditions to defend each piece 
of land. 
  He also praised the plan to plant trees, a plan that reached 
122 million trees following a program on river basins, energy 
forests, fruit trees, and reforestation for defense purposes; 
together with farming and fishing activities so that troops can 
procure their own supplies. 
  The FAR minister also presided over the ceremony to start 
this year's defense preparations by the central army. The 
military organization has three armies -- the Western, Central, 
and Eastern Armies -- and various types of armed forces.

<F P=106> [Article by PRENSA LATINA Columnist Nils Castro, a </F>
Panamanian political leader and journalist: "Actions Speak for 
Themselves"] 
  [Text] Following the election of Carlos Roberto Reina, who 
will take office this month with the support of a considerable 
legislative majority, another event confirms that changes are 
brewing in Honduras that will keep that forgotten country in the 
newspaper headlines over the next few months. At present, the 
issue is the unexpected scope of the report entitled Actions 
Speak for Themselves, presented by National Human Rights 
Commissioner Leonardo Valladares. Valladares' dramatic 
revelations, which involve former governments as well as current 
military chiefs and oligarchic leaders, were made right after 
the president-elect announced his risky plan to downsize the 
Army, which aroused the resistance of his high command. 
  According to the report, between 1979 and 1990, ranking 
civilian and military officials were heavily involved in a 
"dirty war" that included the organization and concealment of 
death squads responsible for the "disappearance" of at least 184 
citizens detained for political reasons. These crimes -- among 
other atrocities of various types -- were carried out in 
accordance with the so-called "National Security Doctrine" 
during the lengthy period when the U.S. administrations of 
Ronald Reagan and George Bush intervened in Honduran 
governments, rendering the country a veritable "aircraft 
carrier" for policies implemented by Washington on the Central 
American isthmus. 
<H5>  Multinational Terrorism </H5>
  These murders -- perpetrated with the advice and 
participation of Argentine soldiers, Nicaraguan contras, and 
U.S. agents -- took place under the military government of 
Policarpo Paz Garcia (1976- 81) and during the civilian 
presidencies of liberals Roberto Suazo Cordoba (1982-86) and 
Jose Azcona Hoyo (1986-90). General Paz Garcia culminated the 
series of military governments that Honduras endured throughout 
the seventies. Paz Garcia was a close ally of Anastasio 
Somoza's regime in Nicaragua. He later organized a constituent 
assembly that confirmed him in his post and regulated the 
transition to civilian rule, guaranteeing that civilian 
governments would exclusively favor the oligarchic leaders of 
the traditional Liberal and National Parties (conservative). 
  Gen. Paz Garcia's first successor, Suazo Cordoba, submitted 
his administration to U.S. policy, lent it for intervention 
against the Sandinist government and the Salvadoran 
revolutionary process, and passed an "antiterrorist law" that 
prohibited strikes and gave free rein to paramilitary groups. 
During his term, Honduras tolerated the permanent establishment 
of U.S. troops and contra bases in its territory -- 
approximately 15,000 men -- as well as an extraordinary increase 
in the size and cost of the Honduran Army, which doubled the 
number of troops and acquired a modern air force. Approximately 
1,200 Americans provided training and logistic support, 
participating directly in military operations in addition to 
organizing provocative "joint" maneuvers with the participation 
of up to 7,000 U.S. troops. 
  The management of the huge foreign military "aid" generated 
widespread corruption within the Armed Forces as well as in 
traditional political circles. This continued throughout the 
term of Azcona Hoyo, who developed a plan for privatization and 
reduced public spending -- without affecting the military -- 
which ended in failure and dramatically harmed the country's 
social situation. Just as Suazo had in the past, Azcona also 
maintained the oligarchy's control over the Liberal Party, 
preventing the development of different political options within 
the organization. Subjected to a plan for Nicaragua and El 
Salvador that was foreign to Honduras, the country's economic, 
political, and moral structures were profoundly deformed. 
  Such frustrations led to the election in 1989 of 
conservative 
Rafael Callejas, now the outgoing president. Following the 
liberals' defeat and transfer to the opposition, there emerged 
within the liberal sector a more civilized trend of social 
democratic orientation headed by brothers Carlos Roberto and 
Jorge Arturo Reina. This trend won the elections in November 
despite the tenacious resistance of the traditional factions 
within their own party. 
  This caused an about-face explainable not only by the long 
years of perseverance and preaching by the Reinas but also by 
the high cost of the failed orthodox neoliberal policy 
implemented by the Callejas administration. There was also an 
abrupt change in Washington's position concerning Honduras: 
After profoundly deforming the country -- for the sake of its 
warlike priorities in Central America -- the Bush administration 
suddenly cut off "aid" to Tegucigalpa following the Sandinist 
defeat in 1990. 
  During Callejas' administration -- which intensified the 
economic "adjustment" initiated by Azcona -- corruption 
continued, there was no reinvestment in the productive sector, 
farm production decreased -- the country now imports corn and 
beans to ease the domestic shortage -- exports came to a 
standstill, the public sector deficit increased, rural laborers 
lost access to land, over one-third of the economically active 
population became unemployed or underemployed, the middle class 
was drastically impoverished, and the boundaries between poverty 
and total destitution were practically erased as low-income 
neighborhoods and social degradation spread. 
<H5>  Adjusting the Adjustment </H5>
  Within this context, one of the key issues of the Reinas' 
campaign was the demand for an "adjustment of the adjustment." 
They advocated an economic policy "with a human face" that 
would satisfy social needs instead of macroeconomic indexes -- 
an issue upon which the international financial organizations 
now agree in view of the threat of social upheaval in the 
country -- and a "moral revolution" to abolish corruption and 
reform policies to recover national sovereignty and bend the 
oligarchs' resistance to true democratization, which is 
essential just to maintain the Liberal Party's control in view 
of a predictable counteroffensive by its traditional sectors. 
  One of the most critical issues in this plan is a reduction 
of the Army's size and power and the creation of an attorney 
general's office to eliminate the Armed Forces' control over the 
police force. The president-elect boldly announced these plans 
as soon as his electoral victory was confirmed. Carlos Roberto 
Reina's position on the issue coincides with that of the current 
U.S. Administration, which, now that circumstances in Central 
America have changed, has acknowledged that the Honduran 
military has a poor human rights record. Reina also agrees with 
the demands of the international financial organizations, which 
have acknowledged that the Honduran Army is a burden on the 
country's public spending. 
  Nevertheless, several high command sources immediately 
expressed their opposition to these plans, thus providing a 
glimpse of the imminent conflict over the issue. It is under 
these circumstances that Commissioner Leonardo Valladares' 
report appeared. The report names some of the commanders as 
well as distinguished civilian members of the two 
oligarchic-liberal governments that preceded Azcona's as 
criminals or accessories, thus dealing a harsh blow to their 
plans to obstruct any changes. 
  Fervently supported by Honduran humanitarian organizations, 
the revealing document -- which implicates current Armed Forces 
Chief General Luis Alonso Discua -- was coldly received by 
spokesmen for the outgoing government and rejected by the 
military hierarchy. Military spokesman Colonel Napoleon Santos 
said that it is part of a "well organized" campaign "to 
discredit the institution by blaming us for things that cannot 
be proven." Another spokesman said the report is based on 
"statements to the media made by biased individuals or on rumors 
that are simply inconsistent." The Armed Forces announced that 
it will not open its archives on the missing persons to which 
Valladares had no access for his investigation. 
  Meanwhile, President Callejas came out in defense of 
impunity, saying that the civilian and military authorities 
involved cannot be legally prosecuted because they had already 
received a previous stay of proceedings for the same charges in 
the past decade. Upon learning of the lawsuit filed by the 
Committee of Relatives of Missing Detainees in Honduras 
requesting that Congress suspend Gen. Discua from his post so he 
can be prosecuted, Callejas added that Valladares' report "has 
no legal foundation and will not be pursued by the respective 
authorities." Callejas alleges that the initiative "revives 
hatred and opens old wounds." 
  The root of this concern lies in the fact that former 
President Ronald Reagan and his ambassador to Honduras, John 
Dimitri Negroponte, are among the people implicated by the 
commissioner and the humanitarian organizations. 
  The outgoing Congress avoided the request to suspend Discua. 
However, in response to public pressure, the Supreme Court of 
Justice ordered common courts in the areas where disappearances 
took place to begin proceedings and arranged for a group of 
prosecutors to examine the report to establish which cases will 
require penal action. Although the current conservative court 
is not trusted by the humanitarian organizations, the initiative 
is relevant because the next Congress -- controlled by liberals 
and strongly influenced by the Reina brothers -- will appoint 
new justices. 
  Meanwhile, the president-elect maintains that "Valladares' 
brave work constitutes an immense effort that cannot remain a 
temporary report." Reina pledged that the new government will 
work with determination to follow up on all of its implications. 
If that is the case, actions will speak for themselves and we 
will see changes of an increasingly democratic nature.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Jesus Bermudez Cutino, PRENSA LATINA </F>
associate, division general of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Cuba, and chief of Cuban Military Intelligence: "Is the Cold War 
Truly Over?"] 
  [Text] The scene of the Berlin Wall's destruction repeated 
over and over in the U.S. press and television and practically 
worldwide carried an implicit message that the "Cold War" had 
concluded, that the threat of nuclear war had passed. This was 
subsequently supported by the Soviet Union's demise. 
  Perhaps Winston Churchill, who definitely marked the 
initiation of the Cold War following his 5 March 1946 speech at 
Fulton University, Missouri, United States of America, would not 
have been so optimistic if he could see several current 
conflicts now. 
  The Korean case: For almost 40 years, the United States has 
virtually maintained an occupation force in South Korea. 
Currently it maintains 30,500 soldiers and 140 diverse types of 
combat planes in addition to the forces it maintains in Japan 
and other areas of the Pacific. These forces could also be used 
in case of a conflict in the region. 
  On 12 March 1993, the DPRK decided to withdraw from the NPT 
[Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty], under pressure to have its 
territory unconditionally inspected by IAEA officials. This 
occurred after it was accused of making preparations to 
construct a nuclear weapon. Although there are ongoing 
negotiations, the situation in the peninsula continues to be 
tense. 
  The anti-Korean campaign started at the beginning of 1993. 
The London SUNDAY TIMES affirmed the DPRK was on the verge of 
constructing the atomic bomb in an extensive April report. 
  In its 28 November 1993 edition, the U.S. magazine NEWSWEEK, 
adding fuel to the fire (or maybe a little more "ice" to what 
was left of the Cold War), labelled the DPRK as "public enemy 
No. 1." The publication affirmed that the United States, the 
IAEA, and South Korea are "convinced" the North Koreans are 
dangerously close to constructing the atomic bomb. 
  The Russian case: When the one-time powerful Soviet Union 
ceased to exist in December 1991, the consolidation of 
friendship and relations between Russia and the United States 
reached unprecedented levels in the military field. In addition 
to disarmament agreements, on 8 September 1993 a memorandum of 
understanding was signed between the U.S. Defense Department and 
the Defense Ministry of the Russian Federation. This was, 
according to the document, within the framework of "leaving 
behind forever the years of nuclear confrontation and superpower 
rivalry." 
  Some U.S. officials have reiterated that Russia is no longer 
an enemy of the United States, and therefore the possibility of 
a nuclear attack being initiated against the United State from 
Russian territory has been reduced 
  Nevertheless, the U.S. combat forces' training program 
maintains a high level of periodic offensive actions. According 
to the so-called strategists, their main adversaries are the 
former USSR republics that have nuclear weapons, particularly 
the Russian Federation. Their activities include several nuclear 
rocket targeting tests and the implementation of massive 
strategic bombings. 
  The report labeled "Total Revision: Forces for a New Era," 
presented by Les Aspin, U.S. secretary of defense, dated 1 
September 1993, after reasserting that the Cold War is over, 
acknowledges: 
  "The dangers that nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass 
destruction represent, including the dangers associated with the 
proliferation of chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, 
associated with the high levels of those weapons that are still 
present in the former Soviet Union." [sentence as received] 
  General George L. Butler, chief of the U.S. Armed Forces 
Strategic Command, in statements to THE NEW YORK TIMES at the 
beginning of March, in referrence to the "target" of U.S. 
intercontinental rockets, said: "We do not only concentrate on 
the former Soviet Union but also on any potentially hostile 
country that possesses or that is attempting to possess weapons 
of mass destruction. 
  It appears the Cold War is not over... definitely not for 
the 
Russians either. 
  The Cuban case: The Cuban-U.S. conflict gained a new 
dimension following the revolution's victory on 1 January 1959. 
Nevertheless, its roots date back many years before Churchill's 
speech, and even before the springing up of socialism as a 
system. It is rooted in the imperialists' appetite for the 
"sugar island," their theory of a "ripe fruit," and based on the 
Monroe Doctrine (America for the Americans) and other similar 
theories. 
  The U.S. Administrations has attempted to isolate, weaken, 
and defeat the revolution through invasion, the well-known 
assassination attempts, the economic blockade (taken to its 
highest levels ever), hostile propaganda, and all types of 
harassment. 
  During the "Cold War," the United States considered Cuba a 
USSR satellite and, therefore, a threat to its national 
security. This is the reason for those Sunday nuclear targeting 
tests against the small island, while the majority of its 
resident slept or were getting ready for their daily voluntary 
work in the countryside and the cities. 
  Although for some theoreticians, the Cold War was officially 
over in December of 1991, the empire's policy toward Cuba has 
turned more dramatic since then. 
  The stepping up of the economic blockade with the so-called 
"Law for Democracy in Cuba," know as the "Torricelli Law," 
represents one more escalation in this "specific cold war" the 
U.S. Government is waging against Cuba. This comes at a time 
when the world is rapidly expanding measures that encourage free 
trade. 
  But revolutionary Cuba, the Cuba that has always been ready 
to help everyone, does not have rights. Cuba must be 
persecuted; it must be cornered, strangled, and starved if it 
does not surrender; this is how things are in the economic, 
political, and military fields. The U.S. Armed Forces will use 
any pretext to maintain a permanent presence in areas near Cuba 
-- whether the struggle against drugs or the situation in Haiti. 
Several U.S. Navy warships and Coast Guards ships are always 
kept a short distance from our coasts. 
  The U.S. Armed Forces have continued to carry out extensive 
exercises and maneuvers around our nation, despite the alleged 
end of the "Cold War." 
  In 1992, for example, the U.S. Armed Forces were engaged in 
the Ocean Venture Exercise that included the landing of 
amphibious craft on Puerto Rico and the passing of large naval 
convoys, including aircraft carriers and amphibious ships, near 
Cuba. This coincided with the Trade Winds Exercise carried out 
in the eastern Caribbean, which included a mock naval blockade 
on a Caribbean island. 
  Also, after the "end of the Cold War," the Unites States 
maintains on Cuba territory -- against the will and wish of our 
government and our people -- Guantanamo Naval Base in the 
southeastern part of the country. The United States was able to 
impose this base under leonine conditions on the budding pseudo- 
republic more than 90 years ago. 
  From this base -- a base that costs U.S. taxpayers 
approximately $821,917 a day -- they annually engage in 
violations of our airspace and national waters by combat 
aircraft and ships that visit the base. In addition, since its 
installation, scores of provocations have been staged against 
our border brigade guards. Their soldiers in this military 
enclave periodically carry out military exercises in which even 
the alleged massive arrival of Cuban refugees from nonoccupied 
territory has been simulated. 
  The immigration issue is another factor that "could make one 
think" that the "Cold War" has not concluded. While the United 
States puts up a three-meter metal wall (similar to the one they 
brought down in Berlin), to prevent the crossing of "illegal 
aliens" from Mexico into U.S. territory, they encourage illegal 
departures from Cuba. They do not care who these individuals 
are, be they mere traitors or common criminals; all are received 
with open arms in Miami. 
  At Guantanamo Naval Base they also encourage illegal 
departures, without taking into account the danger this 
represents. Those who attempt these departures run the risk of 
perishing because of the mines placed on either side of the 
fence. Nevertheless, a high percentage of those Cuban citizens 
who officially request an entry visa at the U.S. Interests 
Office are refused. 
  After reviewing these specific facts, any reader, even 
though 
he may not be an expert in international politics, could at 
least question whether the Cold War is truly over.

  [Text] Quito, 18 Jan (PL) -- President Sixto Duran-Ballen 
today canceled his visit to Peru scheduled later this week 
because of diplomatic difficulties that have arisen in recent 
days between the two countries. 
  Sources close to the president told PRENSA LATINA that the 
president decided a few hours ago to cancel his trip to Lima, 
Peru, and that -- for the time being -- no date has been set for 
his meeting with Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori. 
  Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Diego Paredes recently said that 
Duran-Ballen's trip to Lima was subject to some diplomatic 
details that were being worked out, inasmuch as this was a very 
complex trip because the topics to be discussed were very 
delicate. 
  One week ago, Fujimori told Ecuadoran newsmen that he was 
waiting for Duran-Ballen with open arms, but only to discuss 
topics on integration and economic cooperation and that he would 
not talk about the so-called "border conflict." 
  Diplomatic sources feel the Peruvian president's remarks and 
negative reaction from various public sectors prompted the 
Ecuadoran president to cancel his trip.

<F P=106> ["Summary" of interview with Mexican opposition leader </F>
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas by journalist Oscar Raul Cardoso in Mexico 
"during one of his political rallies"; copyrighted by CLARIN] 
  [Text] [Cardoso] How do you assess the cost of the Chiapas 
crisis for [Mexican President Carlos] Salinas de Gortari's 
projects? 
  [Cardenas] I and other people from my party have been 
pointing out for a long time the ill-advised nature of the 
neoliberal technocratic model implemented in Mexico since 1982 
and the macroeconomic unsuitability of this model here, which 
has prompted a heavy deficit in the balance of payments and 
maintains an overvalued currency. We cautioned about the 
possibility of creating situations of political and social 
instability. The problem is that this model is blind to social 
demands. 
  [Cardoso] The neoliberal model becomes successful by 
expelling the people from the economic system... 
  [Cardenas] The model imposed expels the people not only from 
the system, but from our national territory as well. Over the 
past few years about 500,000 to 600,000 Mexicans have left. 
According to U.S. census data, between 12 and 13 million 
Mexicans are living in U.S. territory. 
  The government believed it would be able to handle the 
situation through repressive policies, through closing 
opportunities for democratic participation, through insufficient 
programs like Pronasol (National Solidarity Program), and 
through corruption and the connivance [cooptacion] of social 
leaders. The government was not unaware of the wild 
concentration of national income among just a few. The 
government was aware of the fact that the model would favor only 
certain areas of production. 
  [Cardoso] The reality that your are describing involves a 
need for rectification. Bearing in mind the North American Free 
Trade Agreement (NAFTA), it is appropriate to ask oneself: 
Hasn't the Mexican economic reconversion gone too far for such 
a rectification to be viable? 
  [Cardenas] Since 1990, when negotiations were initiated, we 
have been raising the need for a agreement that is different 
from the current one. In our opinion the agreement must respond 
to development rather than to the free trade imperative, and 
should not be restricted to North America, but should achieve a 
continental level. For us, this way is more in keeping with 
Mexico's interests during this phase of economic globalization, 
from which we do not intend -- or are unable -- to escape. 
  [Cardoso] You are raising the NAFTA issue in a very 
sensitive 
way. After hearing your words, would it be correct to assume 
that, if you win in the August elections, the government would 
promote renegotiations? 
  [Cardenas] It is not advisable to speculate so much in 
advance. We are convinced that it is possible to achieve a 
better agreement, and this was not achieved because the Mexican 
negotiators failed to do it right. From the perspective of a 
new administration, it must be taken into account that we would 
have 11 months until the inauguration to evaluate how NAFTA 
functions. 
  [Cardoso] Yet those 11 months will not be meaningless, 
especially as there will be a strong impact on Mexico's primary 
production... 
  [Cardenas] Before the agreement, this administration had 
already opened up various economic areas, notably the grain 
sector. The entire importation of agricultural and livestock 
products has been opened up on the basis of permits that yield 
substantial commissions for those who are negotiating them. 
These permits have dealt strong blows to the producers of 
grain, corn, sorghum, beans, rice, red and white meat, and dairy 
products. Mexico's entire agricultural and livestock basic 
production was ruined even before NAFTA's implementation. 
  [Cardoso] Salinas' entire mandate has gone by under the 
never 
entirely cleared suspicion of an electoral fraud, of which you 
were the main victim. Salinas has not been cleared of this 
suspicion, and the Chiapas crisis has reinstated it... 
  [Cardenas] I will correct you at this point. It is not a 
suspicion, but the certainty of fraud in the 1988 elections. 
This fraud is at the root of the Chiapas problems. 
  [Cardoso] Salinas de Gortari does not have a very clean 
record. Before Luis Donaldo Colosio's "uncovering" (election of 
a successor), the president had not even conducted the empty and 
formal consultations that Miguel de la Madrid at least had 
conducted to elect the current president, so as to give his 
candidacy the veneer of consensus... 
  [Cardenas] The goal of increased democratization has not 
become apparent. Nevertheless, there is a problem for the 
government: The results of the next elections must be credible 
for the whole of Mexican society and for public opinion abroad. 
If the government does not guarantee such honesty, I don't know 
what society's reaction might be. It will surely be one of 
popular wrath, as we have already seen in San Luis Potosi, 
Guanajuato, and Michoacan, involving our country's general 
mobilization against an abuse -- as our people tend to believe. 
This is the great problem that the government is coping with, 
especially now with a ruling party candidate who has apparently 
been punched and devalued within the government itself. 
  [Cardoso] Are you not harboring any questions on the way in 
which the Chiapas crisis erupted when, within barely a few days, 
confrontation was replaced by negotiations? 
  [Cardenas] This is food for thought. We are viewing the risk 
of seeing a division in our country between what is controlled 
by the state, and the territory that might belong to the 
Zapatistas in a border area with many precious natural 
resources. We may not ignore that this conflict broke out 
unexpectedly, but apparently is also being resolved even faster, 
very smoothly. One of the scenarios that one may not fail to 
consider is that the revolt might have involved a terrible and 
tragic orchestration. 
  [Cardoso] Do you challenge the character of a true peasant 
revolt, as claimed by the people involved? 
  [Cardenas] No, no. The social basis of the conflict is 
undeniable, but the possibility of manipulation may also not be 
easily ruled out. 
  [Cardoso] In your opinion, what prompted the unyielding 
Salinas from the early moments of the crisis to be replaced by a 
conciliatory Salinas within just a few hours? 
  [Cardenas] It may be explained by an old RCA Victor slogan: 
"The voice of the master." 
  [Cardoso] Are you hinting at the United States? 
  [Cardenas] Yes.

<F P=106> [Interview with Eduardo Ishii Ito, executive secretary of </F>
the Ministry of the Presidency's International Technical 
Cooperation, CTI, agency, by unidentified EL PERUANO reporter; 
place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [EL PERUANO] What is CTI's 
situation in Peru now that conversations with the U.S. 
Government have resumed? 
  [Ishii] Our International Technical Cooperation is going 
through a process of growth and clear evolution at a time when 
we are resuming full diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial 
level. 
  [EL PERUANO] Regarding the national drug prevention and 
control plan, what agreements have been reached with U.S. 
Ambassador Alvin Adams? What is the implementation schedule? 
  [Ishii] The U.S. ambassador met the president of the 
commission responsible for drawing up the drug control and 
prevention master plan. He offered his cooperation, in the 
methodological aspect, for writing the draft of the document 
that will be presented at the end of February in accordance with 
deadlines established by law. [passage omitted] 
  [EL PERUANO] What agreements are being implemented and what 
ones are in a process of approval by the CTI in Peru? 
  [Ishii] During 1933 we created joint commissions to 
negotiate 
and program important projects for the country's development. We 
arranged intergovernmental meetings with Germany, Spain, the 
Netherlands, and the EEC. We also arranged other preparatory 
meetings for negotiating diverse projects. This year we will 
have joint commissions with Switzerland, Great Britain, Spain, 
the Netherlands, and other countries. [passage omitted] 
  [EL PERUANO] Is there a certain method or system developed 
by 
the CTI in Peru that is being copied by other countries? How 
does that system operate? 
  [Ishii] Technical cooperation in Peru has developed and 
implemented diverse ways of implementing projects, particularly 
in emergency zones. The implementation of small social interest 
projects (Pepicos) and the creation of cooperation funds, which 
gather and convert donations of food, equipment, and machinery 
into cash, are important. We have used those funds to implement 
sustainable development projects in areas where the government 
has very little influence. We also must stress that project 
implementation is direct, that is, it is carried out by those 
will benefit from the program. 
  [EL PERUANO] How large is U.S. participation in the fight 
against drugs? 
  [Ishii] There are U.S. personnel in the country. They are 
deployed in the Upper Huallaga region. This support is in answer 
to bilateral agreements between the United States and Peru. 
  [EL PERUANO] Are there any suggestions for Peru and other 
countries to form a common strategy at the world or hemispheric 
level within the new guidelines established by the United States 
to fight drug trafficking? 
  [Ishii] The Peruvian Government has a defined position 
regarding the fight on drugs because it is a problem affecting 
all countries, consumers and producers alike, one way or 
another. This means that we must form a common strategy to fight 
drug trafficking. 
  [EL PERUANO] How much did the CTI receive during 1993? How 
much does it expect to receive during 1994? 
  [Ishii] During 1993 the CTI received nearly $400 million. 
This year we expect to receive approximately $500 million.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Watson Can Compare"] </F>
  [Text] During the past decade Alexander Watson, U.S. 
Assistant Secretary of State for Hemispheric Affairs, lived in 
Peru for three years. He thus has first-hand knowledge with 
which he can compare the Peruvian human rights record at that 
time with the current situation, and can help unveil lies. For 
example, he can check the responsibility of organizations like 
Americas Watch, whose director a short time ago wondered on a 
Lima radio station -- according to a report sent by Aprodeh 
[Peruvian Human Rights Association] -- "how much more is 
necessary to make the Fujimori government substantially change 
its policies concerning human rights and democracy." 
  However, rather than placing the emphasis on such 
ostentatious and unacceptable expressions, the important thing 
now is to ask Ambassador Watson to himself compare the 
antisubversive policy and the human rights policy in force when 
he was ambassador to Peru with the current policy in those 
areas. He should then conclude which of those policies 
preserves human rights. He should also reflect on whether it is 
not actually true that human rights are now more respected than 
they were four, seven, or 10 years ago. 
  It is true for a simple reason, which we will tirelessly 
repeat: There is a consistent antisubversive strategy that is 
based precisely on a systematic alliance with people: on 
respectful treatment, "civic support," and help for their 
defense organizations; on intelligence work that does not make 
use of violence; on a system of summary trials which has become 
more flexible, and has in fact prevented all attempts to take 
justice "into one's own hands"; and last but not least, on legal 
pincers made up of strong penalties with a simultaneous legal 
path toward repentance. 
  If there is anything on which almost all Peruvians agree, it 
is that this strategy should not be modified, and even less so 
"substantially" modified, as Americas Watch put it. Contrary to 
what had happened up until four years ago, people no longer feel 
terror of the Armed Forces. Now people invite them, help them. 
No one wants to change this policy. It turned out to be 
positive and successful precisely because it is based on respect 
for people's human rights. 
  No one is in a better position than Ambassador Watson 
himself, who is acquainted with the previous situation, to make 
this comparison, to verify how far the Peruvian human rights 
record has advanced over the past three years, and consequently 
to verify the magnitude of the lies of those who charge that 
Peru has adopted a systematic human rights violation "pattern." 
Quite the contrary. There is a tremendous difference with 
previous times: in the treatment given to people, in the 
penalties imposed on terrorists, in the treatment of prison 
inmates, and in participation by the people. 
  Ambassador Watson can help dismantle this gigantic infamy 
against Peru, this disinformation campaign which, far from 
recognizing and praising this substantial progress, has ignored 
-- we do not know whether deliberately -- that the great news in 
Peru is not the La Cantuta Prison case, because there were 
dozens of cases like this in the 1980's, but the implementation 
of the strategy based on support for the people and on respect 
for their human rights. 
  This is how the Armed Forces fortunately understood things 
in 
1990, and it is what the international community should praise, 
instead of condemning.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Peru monitored through 27 
January. Source is listed in parentheses following each item: 
  The Inter-American Development Bank, IDB, has approved new 
loans for Peru totaling $300 million, which will be earmarked 
for health and education projects as well as for a program to 
grant property deeds to poor peasants. This information was 
made public on 9 January by Manuel Estela, the Peruvian 
representative to the IDB. He reported that this is the first 
part of $400 million in loans the IDB intends to grant to Peru 
1994. The Financial Development Corporation will be in charge 
of administering the funds. (Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 10 
Jan 94 p 7) 
  The Netherlands' Government has officially notified Economy 
Minister Jorge Camet Dickmann of the partial forgiveness of 
Peru's debt to the Netherlands for the granting of loans on 
concessionary terms, which amounts to $1.9 billion. The 
Netherlands canceled a total of $6.7 billion of Peruvian debt in 
1993. (Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 14 Jan 94 p A4)

<F P=106> [DESCO SPECIAL REPORT No. 31: "Political Violence in Peru </F>
Today," issued by Peru's Center for Development Studies and 
Promotion (DESCO)] 
  [Text] November has seen less political violence than 
almost any other time during the 13 years of war. During this 
month, there were 36 subversive actions, resulting in 42 deaths: 
six military personnel, one police officer, 11 civilians, and 18 
alleged subversives [as published]. 
  In a way, it was predictable that Shining Path [SL], 
especially, would pull back in November, after launching a 
larger number of actions for two months in a row in September 
and October. 
  This month's actions occurred primarily in Lima, which is 
still in first place with 20 attacks (56 percent). SL focused 
most of its bombings on private businesses. There were three car 
bombings during the month, two of them in commercial areas in 
Miraflores and Camacho, while the third one went off near an 
Army barracks. 
  The second-largest number of assaults took place in the 
jungle region, with eight actions (22 percent). In the province 
of Leoncio Prado, there were six clashes, two of them open 
confrontations between subversives and security forces. The 
other four battles arose out of countersubversion actions by the 
Army. And in Leoncio Prado and Huanuco, subversives carried out 
annihilation attacks against civilians. 
  The central region was in third place out of four, with five 
assaults (14 percent). Two of these actions were successive 
confrontations involving the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement 
(MRTA) and the Army in Chanchamayo Province. The other two were 
SL bombings in Huancayo Province. 
  Last place in terms of subversive actions was taken by the 
northern region, with three assaults (8 percent). Two of the 
incidents involved the MRTA; in one they jammed the radios of 
the Chimbote National Police and in the other they rescued two 
of their members as they left the Chimbote courthouse. 
<H5>  Terrorist Attacks by Region: November </H5>

  -  1. Lima 56% 
  -  2. Jungle 22% 
  -  3. Central 14% 
  -  4. Northern 
8% 

    As for the number of casualties, the central region occupied 
first place with 24 (57 percent). All were members of the MRTA, 
killed in clashes with Army troops in the province of 
Chanchamayo. 
  In second place was the jungle region, with 14 casualties 
(33 
percent). Six were Army soldiers who died in two battles with SL 
in Leoncio Prado Province. In addition, eight civilians were 
killed in SL incursions in the provinces of Huanuco and Leoncio 
Prado. 
  In third and last place were the northern and Lima regions, 
which tied at two deaths (5 percent) each. In the northern 
region, an incursion by Shining Path in the village of 
Huayllapampa in Recuay Province resulted in the death of a 
lieutenant governor and a teacher. 
  In Lima, a petty officer in the National Police was gunned 
down from a car in the Cercado district, and a woman was killed 
when an explosive device went off in a bank office in San Juan 
de Lurigancho. 
<H5>  Victims by Region: November 1993 </H5>

  -  1. Central 57% 
  -  2. Jungle 33% 
  -  3. Lima 5% 
  -  4. Northern 
5% 

    There were no subversive actions in the principal region. 
The 
National Police exhibited 10 alleged members of SL in Huamanga 
and another nine in Huancavelica. 
  Finally, in the mid-northern region, another eight alleged 
SL's were exhibited.

  [Text] The Senate office warns against the formation of a 
parallel office at the initiative of certain senators and of 
those whose election on 18 January is contested. The office, led 
by Senator Firmin Jean-Louis, indicates that the various 
resolutions issued by this parallel office cannot in any way 
contribute to the solution to the crisis. The office advises the 
concerned parties that any act emerging from those sessions, 
which are considered illegal, can compromise the parliamentary 
institution. 
  The Senate office invites the 18 January elected to regain 
their self-control, to respect their identities, and to let the 
senators' assembly work on the burning issues of the moment.

  [Text] Kingston, Jamaica, 28 Jan, CANA -- Japan, Jamaica's 
second largest bilateral creditor behind the United States, has 
rescheduled 1.4 billion yen (about 14 million US dollars) of the 
island's debt. 
  The agreement, signed this week, is part of arrangements 
with 
Paris Club member countries allowing Jamaica to receive support 
for its economic reform programme through debt-resheduling 
arrangements. 
  Under the agreement signed by Finance Minister Omar Davies 
and Japan's Charge d'Affaires in Kingston, Hiroshi Funakoshi, 
repayments of the debt will begin in September, 2000 and should 
be in 18 installments at an interest rate of 8.2 per cent 
annually. 
  Up to October last year, Jamaica owed Japan just over 350 
million US dollars. Jamaica's external debt currently stands at 
3.64 billion US dollars.

  [Text] Kingstown, St. Vincent, 28 Jan, CANA -- Former 
minister in the ruling New Democratic Party government in St 
Vincent and the Grenadines, Burton Williams, will be running as 
an independent candidate in next month's general elections, the 
Electoral Office has reported. 
  Williams is among four independent candidates who have been 
allocated electoral symbols for the poll. He has chosen the 
hand as his symbol and will be vying for the South Windward 
constituency which he has represented in Parliament since 1984. 
  Williams, a former minister in the office of Prime Minister 
James Mitchell, resigned from government two weeks ago telling 
journalists he wanted more time to devote to his constituency. 
  However, a release issued theough the Government Information 
Service quoted Williams' resignation letter to Governor-General 
Sir David Jack as saying he was no longer going to tolerate 
Mitchell's contempt and disrespect towards Vincentians. 
  Mitchell later said Williams' resignation was prompted by 
the 
party's decision not to field him as a candidate for the 
February 21 general election. 
  The former minister has been on the campaign trail since he 
announced his resignation. Election officials said they have 
allocated symbols for three political parties and four 
independent candidates, one of whom is a younger brother to 
Williams. 
  Candidates are expected to make an EC500 dollar (one EC 
dollar - 37 cents US) deposit and be nominated by six registered 
voters in the constituency to have a valid nomination. 
  A preliminary list shows there are 66,793 persons registered 
to vote compared with 61,091 in the last poll of 1989.

<F P=106> [Report by Victor Godinez and Antonio Torres] </F>
  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Mexico, 27 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- In an 
unprecedented action in modern Mexican history, the Army today 
held a news conference in which it spoke out for a political 
solution that may reestablish peace in Chiapas State. 
  General Miguel Angel Godinez, commander of the 7th Military 
Region, said the Mexican Army is closely following the contacts 
between Commissioner [for Peace and Reconciliation in Chiapas] 
Manuel Camacho Solis and the armed groups to find a peaceful 
solution to the problem. Godinez asserted that the so-called 
Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] cannot be called an 
"Army" because an army must be an institution and in each 
country there is only one. 
  He criticized the fact that the armed groups cover their 
faces with ski masks, "they have no reason to cover up; no 
matter how covered up he may be, a soldier will not commit a 
crime, therefore, for us, (the EZLN members) are criminals and 
transgressors of the law." 
  Godinez denied that Mexico is at war: "We do not recognize 
nor do we accept that the country is in a state of war, because 
we are fighting a group that has dedicated itself to committing 
armed crimes." He defined the Mexican Army position: "Our 
position is for legality, stability, peace, and work; and 
their's (of the EZLN) is for breaking the law." "In spite of 
the foregoing, we have not persecuted them in the jungle, even 
though we more or less know where they are, very close to 
Ocosingo, as we prefer that the government handle this problem 
politically," he said. 
  The commander explained that in light of the cease-fire 
decreed by the president of the Republic "we remain in the 
outskirts of the cities, after having turned over the municipal 
palaces and the government offices to the corresponding 
authorities." "The instructions from President Carlos Salinas 
de Gortari are that the troops leave the cities so the 
inhabitants may recover their peace and return as soon as 
possible to their normal lives," he said. 
  However, "we will remain quartered near the cities of Las 
Margaritas, Altamirano, Ocosingo, Oxchuc, and San Cristobal de 
Las Casas," he advised. 
  When asked about the alleged human rights violations 
committed by the Army, Godinez challenged the accusers to name 
the places where they claim there have been "indiscriminate" 
bombings against the civilian population. In this respect, he 
encouraged all nongovernment organizations to refrain from 
criticizing and attacking the Mexican Army given the fact "the 
only thing the soldiers have done is to defend themselves from 
an aggression against them by a group that has clearly broken 
the law." 
  With respect to those individuals who were supposedly 
beaten, 
the military officer disclosed that those persons arrested 
during the conflict were immediately handed over to agents of 
the federal and state Attorney General's Office in order to 
avoid any problems with any human rights organizations. 
"Therefore, we are quite concerned about such indiscriminate 
and inaccurate criticism of the Army and that we fired against 
individuals who were only carrying weapons made out of wood, yet 
no one condemns those who sent those persons as human shields," 
he lamented. "Now, it would seem that everything bad about 
these events has been caused by the Armed Forces." 
  He immediately referred to the "alleged" death blow [tiro de 
gracia] found on some bodies after clashes against the rebel 
groups and explained that "when someone is in a trench, the head 
is the part of the body that sticks out and that's why helmets 
are worn." "Nowadays, any head wound caused by a bullet is being 
taken as a death blow," he pointed out. 
  With respect to the amnesty law benefiting the armed groups, 
the military officer indicated the "it is another benefit which 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari decided to implement in 
order to reestablish peace and legal order in the region." This 
"is evidence of the president's interest in finding and 
achieving solutions to this problem by every possible means and 
with the least possible cost of human lives." 
  With respect to the EZLN strategy, the 7th Military Region 
commander believes that within this group there are individuals 
"who are professionals recruited to train other persons, they 
are up to date on guerrilla warfare, and have access to modern 
weapons." He explained that "there is another group that has 
received military training every weekend, every week, and every 
15 days in communities near the jungle region." Another group 
includes "supporters responsible for supplying food and 
intelligence as well as handling radios," commander Godinez 
explained. 
  Moreover, he explained, there is also another group opposed 
to these "outlaws" who are "fortunately a majority. This 
group's members were expelled from their communities for 
refusing to support criminal activities by donating food of 
money."

  [Excerpt] Ocosingo, Mexico, 28 Jan (EFE) -- The Mexican 
Army anticipates new outbreaks of violence in Chiapas and has 
asked the population to take precautions between Saturday and 
Monday [29-31 January] even though a cease-fire has been in 
force in that area since 12 January. 
  According to several merchants and civilians in Ocosingo, 
several Army members have told them not to leave the 
municipality because there might be new confrontations. 
Ocosingo was the scene of the bloodiest fighting during the 
first 10 days of the conflict. 
  The reports, which the National Defense Secretariat (SDN) 
could not confirm to EFE today, maintain that there is tense 
calm in the town and that many residents have traveled to other 
towns so they will not be trapped in new fighting. 
  "So far there are no official communiques, but if there are, 
we will release them as soon as possible," a SDN spokesman said. 
The SDN has neither confirmed nor denied that soldiers are on 
alert in that town in Chiapas. For some days Ocosingo residents 
have lacked potable water and telephone services for unexplained 
reasons. The residents have asked the insurgents and the 
government to begin peace talks as soon as possible so they can 
resume their normal activities. [passage omitted]

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, 29 Jan (EFE) -- Manuel 
Camacho Solis, government commissioner for peace and 
reconciliation, today revealed seven points proposed by the 
government to start a peace dialogue with the rebel Zapatista 
National Liberation Army (EZLN). The government, Camacho Solis 
said, accepted the agenda proposed by the rebels that consists 
of seven points: economic demands, social demands, political 
demands, democratic progress, an end to the hostilities, an end 
to violent confrontations, and the establishment of guarantees 
for the two parties. 
  At a news conference in the colonial city of San Cristobal 
de 
las Casas, about 750 km southeast of the Mexican capital, 
Camacho Solis pointed out that the conditions for peace are 
present, but he added that it is not known whether negotiations 
with the rebels will start soon. The commissioner admitted that 
the Indians are facing "serious living conditions" besides 
racism and isolation and promised to open "legal opportunities 
for the participation" of the armed rebels in society. 
  To end the hostilities, the commissioner proposed 
"negotiation, agreements, declaration of a definitive end to the 
hostilities, disarmament with guarantees for the two parties, 
reconciliation, and return to work and open participation in 
political life by the rebels." The commissioner said that "only 
facts will create new conditions and added that they (the 
rebels) must define their positions and be consistent with 
them." Camacho Solis said that the nation is headed for 
political change and added that the 21 August presidential 
election will be held in peace. 
  "We either settle the problem in Chiapas correctly, 
promptly, 
seriously, and honestly, or a conflict bringing only 
destruction, greater poverty, and isolation will take root," he 
added. The commissioner pointed out that "there are no 
middle-of-the-road points here; we either attain peace or 
Chiapas will not achieve economic modernization and social 
tranquillity. We need to reach peace through democracy and 
determination." 
  Although Bishop Samuel Ruiz, official mediator of the 
conflict between the government and the rebels, announced that 
Camacho Solis and the EZLN command would meet "very soon," the 
commissioner said he does not know when this meeting will take 
place or "if it will take place at all." He added that the peace 
negotiations should establish an agile mechanism to apply the 
recently created Amnesty Law for freeing the rest of the 
hostages and prisoners, reach agreements on the sentences that 
are applicable to the Indians who participated in other social 
struggles, and establish ways to apply the pardon. 
  Camacho Solis said that he sent a note to the rebels on the 
points that were complied with for the release of former Chiapas 
Governor Absalon Castellanos, who the insurgents want to 
exchange for jailed EZLN members. Finally, Camacho Solis asked 
the media in San Cristobal de las Casas to choose a group of 15 
reporters from the most representative media to cover a possible 
meeting. 
  In the past days Camacho Solis exchanged numerous 
communiques 
with the rebels in an attempt to start peace negotiations as 
soon as possible. The population is awaiting these negotiations 
"with anxiety," the local media reported. 
  The EZLN rebelled against the government on 1 January in the 
State of Chiapas and clashed with the armed forces during the 
first 10 days of the conflict. This produced an official toll 
of 108 dead and thousands displaced.

up-to-date radars and the retooling of the Falda del Carmen 
plant are among the topics he is discussing. 
  The Argentine foreign minister stated that he is aware of 
the 
trip by Chilean congressmen to the Malvinas Islands "for purely 
ecological reasons," adding that "they promised to pass on their 
impressions upon their return." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 29 Jan (NA) -- A high-ranking source 
close to the Foreign Ministry disclosed that next week it will 
be officially announced that the United States has acquiesced to 
fitting 36 Skyhawk A-4M planes purchased by the Argentine 
Government with late-generation radars. 
  Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, who is currently 
in Washington, asserted that the meeting he held with U.S. 
Commerce Secretary Michael Kantor to discuss Argentina's 
possibility of joining NAFTA was "highly positive." 
  On the radar issue, it leaked out that negotiations in the 
last few months with the U.S. State Department to overcome the 
logjam in the purchase of Skyhawk A-4M aircraft fitted with 
state-of-the-art radars had yielded successful results. This 
stalemate stemmed from the fact that the United Kingdom, the 
United States' leading partner in NATO, had offered ironclad 
opposition to this business transaction. 
  This information was provided to NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS by the 
aforementioned source, who also noted that the negotiations by 
the former chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, General 
Colin Powell, were of "paramount importance." 
  During President Carlos Menem's state visit to the United 
States last June, Gen. Powell pledged to Defense Minister Oscar 
Camilion to make every effort to supply the radars requested for 
the aircraft bought by Argentina. 
  As the same source pointed out, "they [the Americans] have 
understood that the planes' purchase was not due to military 
buildup reasons but rather to replace, in some way, the ones 
lost during the Malvinas war." 
  Commenting on another issue, Di Tella -- who has been in 
Washington since 26 January conducting negotiations with U.S. 
State Department officials -- played down the importance of the 
visit a group of Chilean congressmen will make to the Malvinas 
Islands. 
  To that effect, the foreign minister noted that he had 
discussed the issue with those Chilean congressmen, who not only 
told him that the reason for the trip is merely environmental, 
but also committed themselves to submitting their impressions to 
the minister once they return home from the trip. 
  Di Tella held talks with Kantor and U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher on 27 January, and this afternoon he met 
Anthony Lake, assistant to the President for national security 
affairs on the National Security Council. 
  Di Tella, speaking on the radio, said: "We discussed several 
subjects with Kantor, including Argentina's chances of joining 
NAFTA and the compatibility between that alternative and 
Mercosur. We want to study both alternatives and see how they 
can be made compatible with each other." 
  Concerning the meeting he will hold with UN Secretary 
General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali, the foreign minister said: "Security and 
drug trafficking are sure to be on the agenda, but they will not 
constitute the main issues of the meeting." 
  To that effect, Di Tella ruled out the possibility of there 
being violent outbreaks in Argentina similar to the ones that 
occurred not long ago in the Mexican state of Chiapas. 
  Moreover, Di Tella disclosed that the luncheon he had with 
Rex Hunt, former governor of the Malvinas Islands just before 
the 1982 war, was "a cordial gesture toward hard-liners in our 
negotiations." 
  "I believe this gesture may be made extensively to all the 
rest and that is the idea they got. Our policy on the Malvinas 
is wise -- it is cordial with regard to some questions, 
especially our dealings with Malvinas' islanders, and inflexible 
as far as the issue of sovereignty is concerned," he underscored. 
  He acknowledged nonetheless that the Argentine Government 
cannot disregard "the phenomenal influence" that a little group 
of Malvinas Islands' inhabitants has over the UK Parliament.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 28 Jan (NA) -- The Argentine 
Government "strongly" criticized the outrages that took place at 
a rally of Edesur [Southern Greater Buenos Aires Electricity 
Company] workers during which "the Chilean national flag was 
given improper treatment." 
  The Argentine Foreign Ministry released a communique 
"lamenting and strongly criticizing this attitude which does not 
reflect at all the Argentine people and government's deep 
feelings of friendship and cooperation." 
  During the rally Edesur employees hung signs bearing all 
kinds of insults against "the Chileans" in front of the company 
building. They also burned flags, an effigy of Edesur Chairman 
Torralba Ugarte, and a coffin that contained a Chilean flag and 
a list of the company's Chilean executives. 
  The demonstrators were protesting the dismissal of three 
company workers on charges of sabotage. They also asked for 
better security measures and job stability, and that there 
should be no more intimidation to get workers to sign up for 
voluntary retirement.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 28 Jan (YONHAP) -- South Korean Vice 
Chairman of the National Assembly Ho Kyong-man met Argentine 
Justice Minister Jorge Maiorano Friday and agreed that the two 
countries sign an extradition treaty within this year at the 
earliest. 
  The two agreed that Seoul and Buenos Aires exchange a 
memorandum of understanding on the matter and expand exchanges 
of law-enforcement officials to strengthen bilateral judicial 
cooperation. 
  "Judicial cooperation is very much in need considering more 
than 35,000 Koreans are living in Argentina and bilateral 
exchanges are growing," Ho pointed out. 
  On this understanding, the two countries decided to sign an 
extradition treaty as soon as possible after consultation with 
the Korean Justice Ministry, he said. 
  On Saturday, Ho finishes his agenda in Argentina and leads 
the four-man National Assembly delegation to Chile, where he is 
scheduled to meet President-designate Eduardo Frei and discuss 
problems of mutual concern.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 28 Jan (NA) -- The Mercosur [Common 
Market of the South] Industrial Council has demanded "long-term 
financing" for the capitalization and retooling of industries. 
It also requested lines of credit "at preferential and 
promotional rates" for the Pymes [small- and medium-sized 
enterprises organization]. 
  The industrialists indicated that these "medium- and 
long-term credit lines" are indispensable to guarantee the 
competitiveness of all sectors against third countries. 
  During their meeting on 27 January at the Argentine 
Industrial Union (UIA) headquarters, the Mercosur Industrial 
Council -- which comprises the industrial organizations of the 
four Mercosur countries -- agreed to promote the preservation of 
the environment. 
  The industrialists also evaluated the need for the 
government 
to ratify the sectorial agreements achieved so far and committed 
themselves to achieving a total consensus on this matter during 
the meeting to be held on 4 March in Montevideo, Uruguay. 
  The businessmen lauded the task of the Mercosur Industrial 
Council, indicating that it is indispensable as a way to submit 
private policies to governments. "It legitimizes us as valid 
interlocutors," they stated, and asked the states to follow the 
example of the industrial sector. 
  "No retooling is possible without an effort from the public 
sector," the industrialists stressed. 
  They emphasized the need to grant loans to the Pymes, "which 
do not have access to long-term lines of credit." 
  The second consensus pertains to the need to preserve the 
environment and agreement was reached on the need to "promote 
industrial production without endangering the environment, based 
on the principles of an economically sustained development." 
  The last agreement foresees the creation of a work group to 
evaluate the Mercosur's negotiation guidelines with the other 
members of the ALADI [Latin American Integration Association]. 
  Within this framework, and regarding trade negotiations, the 
industrialists urged their governments to remain faithful to the 
objectives of the Treaty of Asuncion. 
  During this second meeting of the Mercosur Industrial 
Council, the benefits and scope of Mercosur Resolution No. 13/93 
-- which deals with the consolidation of Customs Union and 
transit within Mercosur -- were discussed. 
  This measure "affirms the purpose of formalizing the Customs 
Union on 1 January 1995 as an essential step toward the 
organization of Mercosur." 
  The measure was lauded by the industrialists, especially by 
UIA members who understood that the governments have 
acknowledged that the deadlines established at the beginning for 
integration were not appropriate. 
  According to UIA spokespersons, the Customs Union "leaves 
the 
door open" to postpone the guarantee clauses that are in force 
until the end of the year and which establish a quota for 
exchange between member countries. When this quota is surpassed 
by a member country it pays tariffs as though it were a third 
country. 
  The possibility of harmonizing industrial promotion programs 
and the search for parity in industrial costs were also 
discussed during the extensive meeting, in which industrialists 
Dagoberto Lima Godoy (Brazil), Hugo Barral (Paraguay), Maxi 
Munoz (Uruguay), and Luis Jose Vasallo (Argentina), among 
others, participated.

  [Text] (DYN) -- The province of Corrientes will only ratify 
the fiscal pact if the government reschedules its 600 million 
dollar debt, Governor Raul Romero Feris said yesterday. 
  The governor added that the issue will be decided, one way 
or 
the other, when a reply is received from the government on 
Wednesday. 
  Yesterday afternoon Romero Feris held a meeting in 
Government 
House with Presidential Chief of Staff Eduardo Bauza and Economy 
Secretary Ricardo Gutierrez, who have scheduled a new meeting to 
take place when Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo returns from 
the economic summit in Switzerland. 
  The governor pointed out that signing the fiscal pact, with 
the consequent abolishment of the gross income tax, means a loss 
of some four million pesos a month to the province until 
alternative revenue-generating measures can be implemented. 
  The former federal trustee in Corrientes Ideler Tonelli had 
signed the fiscal pact last year but the measures has to be 
approved by the provincial officials who took office on 10 
December. 
  Although Romero Feris said that the government was showing a 
"favourable attitude" he warned that if solutions aren't found 
soon social issues in Corrientes could become troublesome.

<F P=106> [Interview with Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani by </F>
journalists Mauricio Funes, Ricardo Chavarria, Aida Farrar, 
Norma Jimenez, Salvador Castellanos, and an unidentified 
moderator at the Canal Cuatro Television studios in San Salvador 
-- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Moderator] The first question will be asked by 
Mr. Funes. 
  [Funes] Good evening, Mr. President. I have been given one 
minute to ask a question on a complex subject. From a political 
viewpoint, crime -- in particular, organized crime -- has been 
regarded as one of the problems with the greatest impact in the 
country. Why does one get the impression that your government 
and the new National Civilian Police [PNC] are powerless to 
check and break up organized crime? Do you and your government 
know what forces lie behind organized crime, which make it 
possible for crime to operate in blatant impunity? So far, no 
investigations have made any significant progress. Also, the 
people are concerned. My specific questions are these: What has 
the government done and what is it doing to check organized 
crime, although the government appears to be powerless? What 
forces are at work in this problem to the extent that the 
opposition could be right in saying there must be a relationship 
between organized crime and the government, considering the 
impunity of criminals? 
  [Cristiani] Good evening to all. Mauricio, I think we should 
first define the nature of the problem, crime, and our situation 
as a country. There are a number of causes to this problem. In 
our country, several factors come to mind: 1) we are in a 
postwar period; 2) the country's economic and social situation; 
3) the world situation, which has much to do with communications 
and the situation to which children, young people, and adults 
are exposed. We will have to tackle the problem at its roots. 
  Organized crime, as you described it, is made up of 
individuals who are used to and know how to operate in a climate 
of violence. This is to say, they are used to handling arms. 
They live in a world of their own. This could play a 
significant role in making criminals. In addition, the peace 
agreements led to the disbanding of three public security 
organizations and the creation of the PNC. I must say that, if 
an agreement is not achieved in this area, we could hardly have 
peace. 
  There also has been much to say about the government's 
inability to effectively confront rising criminal activity. We 
believe that as result of the armed conflict, the country's 
security apparatus was more prepared to deal with a military 
type situation -- in other words, military strategy as opposed 
to criminal strategy. In this respect, there was a need to 
create a new body that would adapt to the country's new public 
security reality -- a new security body with modern specialized 
training, not only capable of repressing criminal activity but 
also with programs to prevent it, as well as having the ability 
to confront other forms of criminal activity. So far, the PNC 
has not yet reached its full potential. Logically, we cannot 
yet expect this organization to perform at its full potential. 
  Currently, the PNC is being deployed throughout the country. 
I would even dare say that the PNC deployment has brought about 
some positive changes. In effect, we have been able to see some 
improvement mainly because of the training the agents must go 
through at the National Public Security Academy, and also 
because the PNC is better equipped than the current National 
Guard [GN]. 
  In this respect, I believe the fight against criminal 
activity is in the process of being solved. Also, improvement 
in investigation techniques into every aspect of organized crime 
is already showing results. I would not agree with those 
criticis who say that no cases have yet been solved. 
  Lately there have been cases in which Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front [FMLN] members have been murdered. 
These cases have been followed by a campaign in which death 
squads are mentioned, or it is reported illegal armed groups are 
committing murder for political reasons. Aside from receiving 
information from the PNC Criminal Investigation Division, 
formerly the Criminal Investigation Commission, I should note 
that the Heleno Castro murder case, as well as the one involving 
the FMLN representative in San Jorge, has practically been 
solved. In short, special treatment was given to these cases. 
We have also implemented the so-called joint working group to 
find if politically motivated illegal armed groups do exist. 
  Also, there are other matters related to organized crime, 
such as vehicle thefts. Lately we have been able to see 
increased efficiency in recovering stolen vehicles. 
Investigations into vehicle thefts are showing other links that 
we must also investigate if we are to destroy the entire vehicle 
theft network. With respect to drugs, I cannot recall any other 
period in which we have been able to disrupt such large drug 
shipments such as those disrupted over the past year. I believe 
this is another type of dangerous organized crime-related 
activity operating in the country. 
  I believe the PNC is not yet operating at its full 
potential. This is something which is going to take some time 
until we can really witness a complete and competent PNC. To 
expedite the presence of the PNC, officers are trained six 
months versus one year, which is the normal training period of 
other public security academies. This is because of the urgent 
need to deploy those forces. In addition, costs are high and 
pose limitations. Some people have asked why 10,000 policemen 
cannot be deployed. The reason is that it costs 60,000 colones 
to train and equip each PNC member. [passage omitted] 
  [Moderator] Ricardo Chavarria from TPS news is next. 
  [Chavarria] [passage omitted] In your 1 January 1989 
inaugural address, you talked about four guiding principles: 
liberty, honesty, reality, and security. I would like to refer 
to the honesty principle. At that time you said this: To 
eradicate the scourge of corruption, which angers Salvadorans so 
much, and for public property to be managed with utmost honesty, 
our commitment is clear and unalterable. We invite the people 
to support us by being vigilant, as well as with their 
constructive and patriotic criticism. 
  Nevertheless, it is now being noted that corruption has not 
been eradicated. On the contrary, the Salvadoran people are 
asking how many members of the past two administrations are in 
jail. Also, they are asking where are your party members who 
are, according to the public, involved in corruption. 
Specifically, I am member of a Chamber of Commerce committee, 
and there is much talk about Social Security as well as the 
public construction projects. 
  [Cristiani] First of all, I believe government corruption 
must be evaluated from two viewpoints -- not only two 
viewpoints, but two types of corruption. The first type 
involves the corruption of an official -- in other words, 
corruption by high government officials. Then we have another 
type of corruption which is a more institutional. 
  The people have mentioned specific cases, such as the 
Customs 
Department, traffic police, immigration, and so on. In terms of 
corruption of public officials, as relates to the question of 
the whereabouts of the members of the past administration, I can 
say there were three or four cases of corruption. There is even 
the case of one official where an arrest warrant has been 
issued; he, however, is not in the country. This is an example 
of a trial which has lasted a long time. In our opinion it has 
taken too long to be resolved. In addition, this same trial has 
blocked any possibility of rebuilding the well-known Carretera 
de Oro. 
  In terms of this administration's high government officials, 
we have already filed charges against two people. In this 
respect, we have tried to be very straightforward. Every 
government official was summoned to a meeting at the Presidency, 
and we appointed a commission tasked with undertaking audits to 
every state organization. 
  It is quite easy to criticize corruption from outside the 
government, and yet it is another thing to understand what is 
actually taking place. One cannot simply send someone to jail 
just to please someone who likes to make a lot of noise and stir 
things up. The bottom line is that charges must first be proven 
if we expect to send someone to jail. In this respect, the 
audits undertaken did not find sufficient merit to file suit 
against any high-level official, except in one case which was 
sent to court. I understand that, unfortunately, the person in 
question is no longer under arrest. I am referring to the case 
of (Lamba). 
  Nevertheless, we have been able to ascertain that what is 
required at this level is, first of all, to try to 
professionalize, or at least give more leeway to, the Accounts 
Court to carry out its duties. Most of all, it is the Supreme 
Court of Justice's Ethics Office which is responsible for 
ensuring that corruption does not take place. 
  In all the auditing that has been performed, some problems 
have been detected in Social Security in terms of the bids that 
are granted. There is a case involving a ghost company, which 
is in the hands of the judicial authorities. It is under 
investigation by the Criminal Investigations Division at the 
judicial level. There has been a lot of talk about bids in 
other cases. Some problems have occurred in the bidding, 
because perhaps that is where we have zealously guarded against 
irregularities. 
  In none of the accusations regarding the bid allocations has 
there been proof or evidence of corruption on the part of high- 
ranking officials. I personally know almost all the 
high-ranking officials, I mean from before the political 
campaign, and I can say there were proved to be honest even 
before they came into the government. 
  In this sense, we have tried to act very firmly, but also 
trying not to make mistakes. Obviously it is easy to blame a 
person, but it is something else to prove charges. The other 
part, which is the institutional part, perhaps is a bit more 
delicate, because there is never evidence. For instance, when 
someone gives a kickback to a policeman, how can you prove it, 
unless you go and make the charge. If someone charges a traveler 
$100 to put a seal on a passport, who can denounce it? 
  There was one peculiar case in which somebody did say 
something to a policeman at the airport. The person was 
dismissed from his post, and his fellow companions who were 
opposed to his removal almost went on strike. We believe the 
institutional problem should be resolved. That was perhaps the 
fundamental recommendation made by the commission that we 
created. 
  The state must be modernized, especially state controls. 
Public officials should not be allowed to act arbitrarily, 
because that is where citizens take advantage of the situation 
to get a kickback, commission, or whatever. Steps are being 
taken. Immigration entry points are free. Land immigration is 
implementing a virtually free entrance at Comalapa Airport, 
where customs regulations are being modified so that there will 
be a sworn statement and so that this sort of corruption will 
not exist. The PNC is trying to train good policemen who are 
incorruptible. 
  Moreover, there is another thing for which we cannot blame 
the state. I always hear about corruption and the corruptor. 
Unfortunately, we have reached a stage in our country where 
moral values have greatly deteriorated. The thinking that 
prevails is this: If I do not do it, I will not be able to 
compete because my competitors do it. In turn, a serious 
problem has been created. There could be drastic solutions, as 
they are called. We could remove all immigration personnel and 
all treasury policemen, but we do not think this is the way to 
do it. Soon there will be not only changes in regulations, but 
also laws to strengthen them, reducing chances for corruption. 
  [Chavarria] You said three kinds of arrests have been 
carried out by the government, and two or three people have been 
fired on this occasion. To satisfy many Salvadorans who insist 
corruption still prevails, what will happen concerning the cases 
presented by the commission? Will this be a problem for the 
next government, or will this come out in the open and the 
culprits sent to trial before you leave? 
  [Cristiani] We have sent certain cases to the National Audit 
Office; other cases have been sent directly to the Attorney 
General's Office, and still others have been sent to the PNC 
Criminal Investigations Division. The social security case was 
perhaps the most obvious. Cases like these are directly sent 
for a judicial investigation. The case sent to the National 
Audit Office.... [pauses] The National Audit Office is able to 
conduct what you might call an investigation. 
  You must remember that the commission members did not 
conduct 
a criminal investigation, though. They conducted an audit, 
searching for evidence, because the truth is that a corrupt 
person never leaves evidence, unless he is truly inept or unless 
his brain does not function very well. In cases of corruption 
you seldom find the evidence; for example, no receipts are 
issued when commissions are paid, or anything like that. The 
idea is to conduct an audit and find something that will allow 
you to send someone to court. People have been sent to court in 
cases where we have found evidence, both involving officials 
from the previous administration and--I repeat-- two in our 
administration. 
  [Cardenal] Thank you, Ricardo. Thank you, Mr. President. 
The third question goes to Mrs. Aida Farrar of Channel 6 
Television's "The Newscast." 
  [Farrar] Thank you. Good evening, Mr. President. I have a 
more specific question, but it is nevertheless of great interest 
to the Salvadoran people, always dealing with crime issues. It 
is said production groups in the country's eastern sector have 
publicly requested deployment of the Armed Forces as a measure 
to fight crime. What is your position on this issue? 
  [Cristiani] First of all, the Constitution of the Republic 
authorizes the use of the Armed Forces in special situations, 
let us say in times of crisis when it is necessary to settle 
something during a short term; then they return to their normal 
functions. 
  First of all, to deploy the Armed Forces and authorize them 
to investigate, prosecute, capture, and send criminals to court 
would cause two problems: One, we would be somehow 
contradicting constitutional norms; two, soldiers are not 
exactly trained to play a role in public security. They are 
trained in a completely different area. They do not know how to 
handle certain cases; for example, they do not know what to do 
in case of a traffic accident. Consequently, we would be 
involving personnel who are not trained to perform a complex 
task. 
  We think the Armed Forces can play a dissuasive role; 
meaning, they can perform their military exercises in broad 
daylight, using roads where most of these incidents occur. In 
our opinion, the Armed Forces can play a dissuasive role, and 
this does not violate the Constitution, because--even if they 
find someone involved in a criminal action at a given moment--we 
must remember that the Constitution also authorizes a citizen's 
arrest. This can be done by anyone who finds a person en 
flagrante delicto. We do not believe it is beneficial to 
authorize personnel who are not adequately trained in public 
security techniques to carry out these tasks, not to mention the 
doubts regarding the constitutional provisions. 
  [Farrar] Thank you very much. 
  [Cardenal] Thank you. The fourth question is asked by Miss 
Norma Jimenez of Channel 4. 
  [Jimenez] Mr. President, I will be brief. What was the most 
difficult decision you had to adopt during your term, meaning, a 
political decision that was extremely difficult to adopt, and 
why? 
  [Cristiani] I believe the most difficult decision was 
adopted 
late in 1989 concerning the advisability of continuing a 
negotiation process. I think--speaking for myself and the 
government level--we felt betrayed by the FMLN's [Farabundo 
Marti National Liberation Front] attitude, because it had signed 
an agreement and then planned an offensive that caused so much 
bloodshed and destruction; nevertheless, the decision we have 
adopted was to continue the negotiation process, because we were 
convinced it was the only way to achieve a long-term solution, 
while the opposite meant we would have to face a conflict for a 
much longer time, with the consequences this would entail for 
the country and the people. We now believe the correct decision 
was adopted even though you may recall the feedback we received 
from an extremely large number of groups was that we could not 
talk with people who even betrayed a process that had recently 
started. [passage omitted] 
  [Farrar] Do you believe the FMLN is prepared to govern our 
country? 
  [Cristiani] The truth is, regarding economic matters, I do 
not know their programs, but what does cause concern is that the 
FMLN was a group that had a Marxist-Leninist ideology. After 
the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain, and the 
Soviet Union itself breaks up and accepts the failure of that 
statist ideology, the FMLN is logically going through an 
adaptation process. It is leaving that ideology and saying it no 
longer believes that ideology and that it now believes in other 
types of economic policies. 
  We have already heard someone who is a social democrat; we 
have heard of much support for private enterprise, whereas we 
know that its basic ideology was essentially anti-private 
enterprise. 
  Now the question is whether there is a tendency to 
improvise, 
because I am no longer sure of what they really believe. I 
believed in something, and now the circumstances have made me 
change; the question is, how much flexibility will they have 
regarding economic matters? [passage omitted] 
  Exports have doubled over the past five years, despite the 
low price of coffee, sugar, cotton, and other products. It is 
not true that there is no development policy or that it has 
failed. I would not say that doubling exports in five years, in 
four and one-half years of government, is a failure. [passage 
omitted] 
  We had the largest harvests in history concerning cereals. 
In coffee, we had the largest harvest in 1992 since 1979; in 
sugar, last year's harvest was the largest in history. There 
are approximately 150,000 new manzanas that are already being 
used for agricultural production. 
  The Agricultural Development Bank [BFA] has doubled the 
amounts of granted credit over these five years, despite the 
fact that its finances have been reorganized. BFA credit is for 
small producers, and if it has been doubled, we cannot speak of 
a lack of attention to the small- and medium-size producers of 
the agricultural sector. 
  Certain problems have arisen regarding the credit problems 
that some producers--particularly the producers of the eastern 
area, which was the most devastated--still had once the conflict 
ended. We have tried to solve the problem. We have issued a 
specific decree to provide them with a line of credit; we have 
eliminated all of the accrued interests, and the interests to 
pay were recalculated at a lower rate, thus eliminating the 
capitalization of banks as their loans became overdue. We have 
stopped all the embargoes and so on. We have tried to help all 
of them; there may be some that perhaps do not even have the 
monetary capability to solve their economic problems. It is 
regrettable, and one understands and sympathizes with them. 
  The government cannot help a company that has gone bankrupt, 
however; in other words, the government cannot go bankrupt. 
There are things that can be done and others that we cannot do. 
  I believe the main problem is prices, particularly of our 
export products. In that regard, the government can only do 
with coffee exports as we have been doing. On the other hand, 
the problem of profitability in the agricultural sector is not 
due to the lack of facilities; it is because the international 
price of products is low. A government cannot subsidize low 
prices in the agricultural sector. The agriculture sector in 
our country will have to be updated. We cannot separate the 
agricultural and livestock sector from globalization or economic 
openings. We cannot lend a specific sector a hand by 
subsidizing it. Someone has to pay for these subsidies. If the 
other sectors are not subsidized, we cannot make an exception 
with this sector. 
  I admire Ulises Gonzalez very much, because he is probably 
one of the few who has carried out this struggle without owing a 
cent. I question the attitude of others who have come forward 
shouting things, but I regard Gonzalez as an honest person, a 
man of principles. As I said, he has been fighting for a more 
flexible decree. He has discussed the matter with the Central 
Bank president many times. What we must realize, however, is 
that the government cannot subsidize any sector. When prices 
are low, farmers must create their own mechanisms to face the 
situation. This applies to all economic sectors. 
  I believe we have done much in the agricultural sector, from 
privatizing commercial activities--particularly with coffee and 
sugar--to offering more credits to the small and medium 
producers. As for investments, according to statistics from the 
Central Bank two out of every three credits are given to small 
or medium enterprises; in other words, we cannot say that small 
and medium enterprises are not receiving help. [passage omitted] 
  [Passage omitted] [Cardenal] The fourth question is by 
Mauricio Funes of Channel 2. 
  [Funes] Thank you. I am going back to a response you gave to 
my colleague. You said the increase in imports stimulates 
exports in the long run. The problem is that we have had an 
increase in imports based on foreign currency that was not 
generated by the country's own capability, no matter how many 
times one hears that Salvadorans living abroad are still 
Salvadorans and that this is a domestic effort. 
  Analysts concur that the 5-percent growth the government 
announced at the end of 1993 was based on the number of 
remittances sent from relatives and foreign aid. This aid is 
decreasing, as the U.S. Government announced recently. Can the 
country keep on supporting itself on what economists refer to as 
fragile bases for economic growth? 
  Given that we have been unable to stimulate exports as a 
source of foreign currency, we continue to depend on remittances 
sent from relatives abroad and foreign aid. Although you said 
dependence on other countries has been reduced, we continue to 
depend on the remittances of relatives and foreign aid to 
sustain economic growth. Wouldn't we have to redesign the model 
implemented so far? 
  As Anep [National Association of Private Enterprise] has 
constantly suggested, the state must become modern and create an 
adequate policy to promote exports so that growth can take place 
on solid bases, not on what is called fragile bases. 
  [Cristiani] I think this is an axiom one reads in economic 
texts, or at least I did when I went to university. One 
ingredient in promoting exports is to eliminate all import 
problems and barriers. You said the dollars coming in from 
abroad are contributing to the trade deficit. That is true, but 
the contribution is decreasing all the time. 
  I am going to repeat my answer to the previous question. 
Would you consider it a failure to have tripled exports in the 
country in a period of four and one-half years? This happened, 
despite the price of coffee. The price of coffee.... [pauses] 
When we know the bases that will help us determine whether 
exports have doubled.... [pauses] We are talking about a rather 
considerable export, namely, coffee. There has been growth in 
nontraditional products. I am asking if this is truly a 
failure or if we are headed on the right course. Granted, we 
have not closed the gap yet, but nothing happens overnight. If 
the model is mistaken or the program to boost exports is wrong, 
how are we to account for the fact that exports based on 
nontraditional products doubled in four and one-half years, 
considering we had a war going in three of those years, and we 
did not have the economic drive we now have, given the 
insecurity aspect is out of the picture. [passage omitted] 
  [Castellanos] Our economy is growing, but I wonder when 
will this growth reach me personally. At the beginning of this 
government, much was said about the economy overflowing and 
cascading down onto the people. People are saying, however, the 
benefits stay at the upper layers of society and never reach the 
lower ones. The following question has been asked a thousand 
times: If the economic and macroeconomic indexes are so 
encouraging and promising, why does a large segment of the 
population still live in extreme poverty? 
  [Cristiani] I wonder what the moderator would say. I could 
answer your question, although by doing so we would go fully 
into the social aspect of the situation. We could speak about 
social development, which works for the good of the Salvadoran 
people. 
  [Cardenal] Mr. President, we will have to leave this answer 
for the social portion of the conference, because we are 
somewhat behind schedule; nevertheless, we appreciate these 
questions. We will now move on to the third and last block, 
which deals with social aspects, and we will broach health, 
education, housing, poverty, employment, and the family. Again, 
we would like to remind our distinguished guest journalists 
about the need to keep their remarks as brief as possible due to 
time; this request is also extended to the president, although 
we know it is difficult to sum up certain types of subject 
matter. Ricardo Chavarria will ask the first question in this 
block. 
  [Chavarria] It will be easy for me, because I will only 
expand on Castellanos' question. The Christian Democratic Party 
did us a favor by faxing nearly everything for us. The planning 
minister has told us extreme poverty has been reduced by just 
one percent. Castellanos spoke about an appeal to reduce poverty 
even further. Laborers, secretaries, and plant workers share a 
common trait. They are no longer taking lunch. They are content 
with a snack. At the most, this can be regarded as a double 
breakfast. This is a serious sign that people at present cannot 
afford to pay seven, eight, or 15 colones for lunch plus a bus 
ride. My specific question is whether you have been working for 
the poor among the poor. A 1-percent reduction has been the 
result [words indistinct]. 
  [Cristiani] I would like first to say that someone lives in 
extreme poverty when he receives no income whatsoever. The most 
important thing is to begin by helping those who possess the 
least. Those who have a job are better off than those who have 
nothing and, in addition, have no income. 
  Approximately 150,000 new jobs have been created. These jobs 
are determined by observing both the number of people who pay 
quotas to the Social Security Fund and statistics. This figure 
is the number of jobs for which have been accounted. This means 
150,000 people can no longer be regarded as extremely poor. 
Regardless of the accuracy of your figures, it would be 
necessary to determine how many people are jobless and how many 
of them are now employed. In this regard, I quote John Paul II, 
who says the problem of extreme poverty will not be solved if 
production is not established and if jobs are not created. It 
is also necessary to talk about the standard of living; that is, 
the care of the people. We can mention several indexes. The 
United Nations has certain parameters to measure a society's 
standard of living. One is life expectancy, which statistically 
has improved from 57 to 65 years. [passage omitted] 
  In the health sector, the budget has increased from 
approximately 300 million to a little more than 700 million 
colones. More and more, we have been using our own resources, 
not foreign resources. This refutes the person out there who 
says we still depend on foreign resources. The fact that we 
succeeded in lowering our imports from 24 to 9 percent indicates 
foreign assistance is becoming less and less. 
  Figures taken out of context, without analyzing the state 
budget or state investment situation as a whole, may not 
suitably mirror the general situation. [passage omitted] 
  Since the beginning of the administration, the trend has 
been 
a reduction of budget investments in the nonsocial sector and an 
increase in the budget percentage apportioned to the social 
sector; that is, the percentage of investments in the social 
sector is growing, and this trend should continue. [passage 
omitted] 
  Adjustment policies are required only when there are 
distortions. I am sure the next government will not need 
adjustment policies. It will simply have to be responsible in 
handling economic activities and public finances. We have 
resolved the problem for the next government. We are the ones 
who had to shock treat economic distortions due to the economic 
mess to which the country had been led. Had we not implemented 
that policy at that moment, we could have had inflationary 
levels similar to those in certain South American countries. 
  Nicaragua [words indistinct] has had inflation levels of 
three digits. I think surgery is performed when there is an 
illness. Once there is health, why perform surgery? 
  All that has to be done now is to continue acting in a 
responsible fashion and to manage government finances free of 
demagoguery. 
  Our economic policy is not a simple structural adjustments 
program. No. The fact that at a given moment we had to make 
structural changes due to distortions does not mean this is our 
economic policy. Our economic policy is based on a social 
market economy, the honest handling of public finances, and the 
development of exports. These are not adjustments but efforts 
to develop the country. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Enrique Lemus; from the "YSU Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Free trade between Colombia and El Salvador and 
aspects concerning the Latin American coffee retention plan were 
two of the most important topics President Alfredo Cristiani and 
his Colombian counterpart, Cesar Gaviria, have discussed during 
their first meeting. Concerning the coffee issue, the 
Salvadoran president has said that with the retention of 20 
percent of exports, favorable results regarding international 
prices are being achieved. He has said Colombia has an 
important role in the participation. 
  [Begin Cristiani recording] We will continue to promote 
certain cooperation and free trade mechanisms with Colombia. 
During this short meeting, we talked about coffee. We made a 
follow-up and an evaluation of the retention process, now that a 
minimum price agreement was reached this week. We have seen a 
favorable response regarding prices. We think it is going well, 
and we believe we must continue to take these measures until a 
stable price is reached. In this regard, Colombia's 
participation is vital due to the impact they have on the 
market. [end recording] 
  Concerning a free trade agreement with Colombia and 
Venezuela, Cristiani has said all they are waiting for is the 
settling in of the new Venezuelan Government, so as to promote 
the trade negotiations. 
  [Begin recording] [Cristiani] We talked about a free trade 
agreement between Colombia and Venezuela, and we talked about 
Venezuela's situation with their new government, internal 
problems, and the difficulties that may emerge from a quick 
follow-up of the negotiations. We believe once President Rafael 
Caldera is sworn in, we are going to continue trying to promote 
the agreement. Both President Gaviria and I are interested in 
reaching a free trade agreement between Central America, 
Venezuela, and Colombia. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Did you talk about Gaviria's 
candidacy to the OAS? 
  [Cristiani] We did not talk about that; we had already 
talked 
about it on the telephone. He is already aware of El Salvador's 
position and that of the Central American countries. He has not 
yet decided on his candidacy. He is still studying the 
possibility of running, but we did not talk about it. [end 
recording] 
  Finally, Cristiani said that even though President Gaviria 
could be one of the candidates for the post of OAS secretary 
general, Salvadoran support will not be given to him, because 
the Central American countries have agreed to support the Costa 
Rican foreign minister, Bernd Niehaus. If there were any 
changes regarding the support given to the candidates, it would 
have to be out of a consensus with the rest of the regional 
countries, according to the Salvadoran president.

<F P=106> [Speech by Colombian President Cesar Gaviria at the </F>
Salvadoran Legislative Assembly in San Salvador--live] 
  [Text] Legislative Assembly President Jose Roberto Angulo; 
Mr. Vice President of the Republic, Messrs. Vice Presidents and 
board secretaries; honorable deputies; Madame Foreign Minister 
of Colombia; members of the government cabinet; members of the 
diplomatic corps; Salvadoran friends: 
  It is a source of great satisfaction for me to stand here 
today before the Salvadoran Legislative Assembly, the forum par 
excellence of Salvadoran democracy. I have spent a major part 
of my public life within the rooms of the Colombian Congress. 
Many of the ideas and plans that have inspired my 
administration were conceived during fruitful debates, harsh 
controversies, nights and days of full devotion to the noble 
task of legislating. I have also suffered defeats; who hasn't? 
Defeat in the legislature, hammer pounding an anvil, does not 
leave wounds, however, but forges and strengthens democratic 
convictions. 
  In these times, when it has become so common to say that 
legislatures are inefficient, archaic, and even unnecessary, 
when authoritarian forces frequently blame deputies and 
congressmen for all the ills that governments have been unable 
to resolve, I must reiterate my faith in the validity of 
Congress as an irreplaceable expression of popular will. I want 
you to know that here, among you, I somehow feel that I am among 
colleagues. 
  Last night, during a dinner in my honor hosted by President 
Cristiani, I had the opportunity to praise the Salvadoran peace 
process. There is no question that the end of the Cold War has 
made peace possible in many places, because the people who 
encouraged war and who with their hatred fed rivalries among 
brothers were suddenly left without a purpose. Justifications 
for arming insurgents, supporting tyrants, denying freedom, and 
preventing coexistence ended, and an era of hope thus began for 
our America. 
  Peace in El Salvador would not have been possible without 
the 
iron will of the conflicting sides, who were able to look beyond 
themselves to discover what the future held for the good, 
hardworking people of this country, the peace of mind and 
prosperity they deserved for a thousand reasons and which for 
such a long time had been denied them. The peace all of you 
fought so hard to achieve is an example that shows the world 
that reconciliation is possible if men undertake to achieve it 
without revanchist designs. This is perhaps the most visible 
success we have witnessed in the area of peace during these 
post-Cold War times. 
  Undoubtedly, our region is undergoing a crucial period, and 
in the days that lie ahead we will have to make important 
decisions that will test our character and vision of the future. 
  I will not punish you today with an endless speech. I would 
like instead to share with you some of my thoughts concerning 
those issues which, in my opinion, will be among the major 
issues on the hemisphere's political agenda over the next few 
years. Among these are free trade, reformation and 
modernization of the state, and the defense, strengthening, and 
consolidation of democracy. 
  A few weeks ago our countries experienced considerable 
uncertainty, because, on one hand, the fate of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement was unclear, and on the other hand 
the final result of the GATT Uruguay Round was still a mystery. 
  Today, fortunately, the panorama is much clearer; NAFTA's 
approval has renewed our hopes for the creation sooner or later 
of a hemispheric free trade zone, while the culmination of the 
Uruguay Round not only guarantees the existence of the 
multilateral trade system but provides the necessary confidence 
and stability for the world economy to advance toward its 
definitive recovery. 
  For our countries, which have believed in the goodness of 
free trade and have thus struggled so much for its enforcement, 
NAFTA is the best proof that we are capable of reading the 
future and that we have managed to figure out the true signs of 
the times from our history books. Free trade is the best way to 
achieve economic growth and greater well-being for our people. 
  I have personally studied all the integration processes 
under way on this continent: NAFTA, the Group of Three, the 
Central American Common Market, the Caribbean Common Market, the 
Andean Pact, the South American Common Market, and bilateral 
processes. These are efforts that truly lead to the common 
objective of building a great hemispheric free trade zone. 
  All of us have noted how Latin America has been for several 
years involved in aggressive policies for the opening, 
modernization, and internationalization of their economies, 
increasingly betting on the benefits that the promotion of the 
private sector, free trade, competition, productivity, and 
efficiency offer. 
  In this regard, to mention the Colombian case, in only three 
years we have made significant progress on many fronts. The 
opening of our economy, by changing our former closed economic 
model to one open to the world, was a result of the decline of 
the model that called for the substitution of imports. This 
opening took place in a context different from that of our 
neighbors. 
  Our decisions were not the result of a crisis or of an 
imposition. Our economy is the one that grew the most from 1980 
to 1990. We knew, however, that to grow more rapidly and to 
eliminate poverty in Colombia in a few years, it was necessary 
to integrate our economy to the global economy, to open markets 
for our export products, to compete, to open up to foreign 
investments, and to create conditions to encourage private local 
investments. 
  We reduced our customs and we adopted competitive labor laws 
and foreign investment programs. The results have been 
satisfactory. We have diversified and expanded our exports, 
diminished inflation, reduced unemployment by 15 percent in the 
past four months, and increased our economic growth to levels 
above the 5 percent level. 
  We have adopted an aggressive commercial policy that has 
yielded integration with Venezuela, Ecuador, and Bolivia in the 
framework of the revitalization of the Andean Pact; we signed a 
trade agreement with Chile; concluded the Group of Three 
negotiations; and have made much progress in the negotiations 
for trade agreements with Caricom and the Central American 
Common Market. 
  I have said that we are prepared to reach with these two 
markets a two-way trade agreement that should mirror the various 
economic development levels. This is usually called 
asymmetrical relations. 
  There is no better opportunity than this one, here, in El 
Salvador, to reiterate our political will and to ask the Central 
American authorities to do so too in order to work jointly to 
turn dreams of a great trade treaty between Colombia, Venezuela, 
and the Central American common market into a reality to 
encourage a new flux of trade and productive investments for the 
benefit of our nations. 
  Much political will and a true commitment by all the 
countries of this hemisphere will be necessary to give form to 
the puzzle of a single market from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. 
  This is why I believe that in the next few months, the 
continent must work to secure and recreate the integration 
processes for the purpose, as I have said, bringing about a 
grand hemispheric free trade zone. 
  This requires that our governments and the international 
organizations to which we belong act vigorously and decisively 
to turn what now appears an option we cannot ignore into a 
tangible reality. 
  Preliminary studies indicate that with the culmination of 
the 
GATT Uruguay Round and the World Trade Organization round, 
global trade will increase rapidly at an annual rate of 6 
percent, approximately $200 billion annually. 
  Our challenge is to take advantage, as much as possible, of 
this increase so that our countries, which belong to what is 
nowadays viewed as the world's second most dynamic region in the 
field of economic development -- second only to Asian South 
Pacific -- may secure greater participation in world trade. 
  I am sure that we can attain higher achievements unitedly 
rather than separately and that any increase in participation in 
global trade will bring social and economic benefits to our 
people in the form of jobs and new investment opportunities. 
  However, the truth is that this is only one of the basic 
aspects our continent will have to face in the coming days and 
months now that virtually all countries in the area have agreed 
on an economic liberalization, which guarantees greater growth; 
winds of commercial opening blowing from north to south; and 
there is a relative consensus regarding the role the private 
sectors of our countries will play in the struggle for 
development and so on. Now that there is striking clarity on 
the benefits of the market, Latin American politicians cannot 
continue forever to discuss topics of which we are already aware. 
  When I refer to the pivotal role of the market, I want to 
clarify that it is not that I am downgrading the central role of 
the state. On the contrary, I want to emphasize that as it 
happens in a game of cards, once the moment of shuffling and 
dealing comes along, some cards will go to the market and others 
to the state. In our countries, we should make sure that these 
cards are divided fairly because a state without a market 
generates inefficiencies while a market without a state results 
in inequality. 
  We know that market laws are unable to solve the many 
problems that still affect our society such as extreme poverty, 
class divisions, and lack of opportunities. Consequently, we 
need a strong state, that will not only control, on behalf of 
the public interest, what takes place in the market, but that 
will also lead a strong investment initiative to generate human 
resources, that is, to invest in our people. 
  It is fair to recognize that our states still need to become 
more efficient and competitive so as to strengthen the 
democracies of the area. To enable our democracies to face 
successfully the challenge of promoting an egalitarian social 
development, it is necessary for states to modernize and for the 
way politics is conducted to be changed.

  [Text] A 60-percent cut in U.S. financial aid to El 
Salvador will not have a major impact on the Salvadoran economy, 
Central Reserve Bank President Roberto Orellana Milla said 
yesterday. 
  The official pointed out that the country's economy will be 
sufficiently strong to bear this without major problems by 1996 
when the effects of this cut will be felt in projects. He 
explained that economic programs for 1994 and 1995 will not be 
affected. 
  Orellana pointed out that the effects of the cut will 
reportedly start to be felt in 1996, "but by then the country 
will be nearly independent due to economic development and an 
increase in funds sent to El Salvador by relatives living 
abroad." 
  International aid "has been used to support infrastructure 
reconstruction projects and repair damage caused by the 
guerrillas during the recent conflict." Orellana pointed out 
that funds sent by relatives to El Salvador are a reality of the 
country's economy because they constitute aid sent by 
Salvadorans working in the United States and this amount will 
not decrease.

<F P=106> [Report by Romulo Matamoros; from the "The Morning Paper" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Lieutenant Colonel Napoleon Santos Aguilar, Honduran 
Armed Forces spokesman, said the military had to handle a report 
that turned out to be a false alarm before the inauguration of 
the new government. 
  [Begin recording] [Santos] The Public Security Forces were 
alerted to an unidentified object, near the Camosa area, I 
understand. Specifically, it was located on the route to 
Toncotin Airport. The bomb squad went to the site and 
determined it was an empty box. [end recording] 
  Commenting on the catcalls heard at the Tegucigalpa National 
Stadium during the inauguration the moment the Honduran Armed 
Forces General Staff members entered, Santos said: 
  [Begin recording] [Santos] We regard this in a positive 
light. This definitely shows you rifles have not served only to 
crush the people. The people at any given time are totally at 
liberty to express themselves without the fear of being crushed. 
We believe this is a situation.... [pauses] We look at it 
under a positive light. These situations definitely merit 
analysis. This did not happen four years ago, and it happened 
now. We hope that in the next four years corrective measures 
are taken. That way the situation will be totally different 
four years from now. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Colonel, why do you think the people 
in the stadium jeered you? 
  [Santos] The fact is these things happen to express 
disapproval of certain actions that are not conducted by 
institutions but are often isolated incidents by individuals who 
commit actions that fall outside the law. [end recording] 
  Santos maintained the catcalls were not directly aimed at 
Luis Alonso Discua, the Armed Forces chief. 
  [Begin Santos recording] This is not a situation against the 
Armed Forces chief. It shows disapproval of some actions that 
we have acknowledged at the opportune time and have sought to 
correct. At any given moment, the important thing is to analyze 
them with the goal of amending them so these things do not 
happen. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, chief of </F>
the Armed Forces, by Reporter Trino Murillo on 25 January; place 
not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Murillo] Yesterday, General Luis Alonso Discua 
Elvir, chief of the Armed Forces, explained certain Armed Forces 
plans and rebutted criticism from certain sectors of Honduran 
society. At the beginning of the interview Gen. Discua 
discussed a very important issue: the transfer or change over of 
Joint Chief of Staff Reynaldo Andino Flores to the Defense 
Ministry. My first question is if this should be viewed as a 
purge or a normal change within the Armed Forces. 
  [Discua] Allow me to tell you that no ulterior motives 
should be attached to this situation. A list of officers who 
could fill the Defense Ministry post was presented to the 
president-elect, who had publicly requested such a list at a 
council meeting. When he returned from the United States I gave 
him a list of several officers and the selection was made 
exclusively by the president- elect. 
  [Murillo] That is a normal decision during a change of 
government. Nevertheless, he also spoke of the duties the 
military institution would carry out through the Executive 
Branch to coordinate with Congress a purging of the police and 
to counteract the crime wave that is destroying the country. 
  [Discua] As I said, there are many issues that must be 
approached in a very serious manner, such as military service, 
human rights, and the police. I have spoken at length with the 
president- elect about these issues because the Armed Forces 
want to resolve them. Of course, it would be irresponsible on 
our part to [words indistinct] because that requires a process 
that should conclude prior to the year 2000 when the police and 
Armed Forces are in the condition the people would like to see. 
The Armed Forces have always agreed with a constitutional 
reform pertaining to the police, and we are working on it. In 
due time we will present a report to the president-elect; the 
general situation has been outlined to him and we are waiting 
for him to summon us. We are [words indistinct] to all the 
issues that have been sources of controversy at any given time, 
but this has helped us to reconsider and begin a period during 
which, I believe, the people will be content. 
  [Murillo] Spokesmen from the party that is about to take 
office have said that international organizations are pressing 
for constitutional reforms and that they have established 
certain conditions. These conditions include reducing the Army 
and making certain basic taxes mandatory so payments will 
continue to be made to the government. What is your reaction to 
this? You have always said that foreign pressure should never 
prevail. 
  [Discua] I must tell you that approximately three months 
ago, or, in other words, last year a meeting was held in Chile 
to examine Latin America's military spending. The participants 
took a very close look at military spending with regard to each 
country's gross domestic product. In Latin America, military 
spending fluctuates between 1 percent and 7.6 or 7.8 percent. 
Therefore, there are countries whose military spending is very 
high. Honduras' spending is less than 1 percent. In other 
words, our military spending with regard to our GDP is the 
lowest in Central America and even in Latin America. The 
Honduran Armed Forces have a budget of $40 million; Costa Rica 
has $48 million, and the figure rises. In other words, Honduras 
is the Central American country that spends the least on its 
military. 
  [Murillo] [words indistinct] making of demands seems to be 
a prerequisite? 
  [Discua] This is logical. However, I believe the 
president-elect stated categorically in Washington that the 
Armed Forces reduction had to conform to each government's needs 
for equipment [word indistinct]. I have always said that we 
have to find a balance in Central America. I know the 
institution must make structural reforms to be in keeping with 
the new government's modernization policy. 
  [Murillo] With regard to the implementation of the military 
law, General Discua said there is no wrestling for power or 
internal strife in the military institution. He added that new 
groups arise in the Armed Forces as classes start to retire in 
compliance with the institution's bylaws and military law. 
  [Discua] Logically, we at Mufoco [expansion unknown] will no 
longer be active Armed Forces officers, and new classes will 
start taking our places. I believe we have to start the opening 
process. My entire graduating class will retire when I finish my 
term and new classes will take our places. They are young 
military men with experience who will always try to do what is 
best for the institution. We have to hope that this is how it 
will turn out. 
  [Murillo] As an institutional policy, and based on 
international agreements, several U.S. Government sectors have 
already asserted that they support turning Palmerola into a 
regional counter narcotics center for Central America and the 
Caribbean. This prospect is also supported by President Reina. 
Do the Armed Forces endorse it too? 
  [Discua] One of my administration's main objectives has been 
the struggle against drugs. I have supported all the programs 
initiated by our government and those initiated by friendly 
countries to defeat the scourge of drug trafficking. I have 
always said the Soto Cano Base should be turned into a Honduran 
base to combat drug trafficking at a regional level. It should 
unify all actions in the region to enable us to stop or lessen 
the flow of drugs to northern countries. 
  [Murillo] Has this been discussed at top levels, General? 
  [Discua] Yes, we have been talking about this possibility 
constantly. I visited Washington and talked with senators and 
congressmen about my plans to combat drug trafficking.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 28 Jan (AFP) -- Guatemalan President 
Ramiro de Leon Carpio today said the recent terrorist attacks in 
his country are linked to the upcoming referendum, and he added 
that some "extremist groups" do not want the democratic process 
in Guatemala to be strengthened. 
  De Leon, who attended the swearing-in ceremony of the new 
Honduran president, regretted that the bombings, blackouts, and 
some shootings, which took place in the capital last night, are 
creating tension in his country two days before the referendum. 
In Sunday's referendum, the people will decide whether to 
approve a series of constitutional reforms, the most important 
of which will allow new officials to be appointed to the 
Congress and to the Supreme Court this year. 
  De Leon said he and Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina 
share the goals of fighting corruption, drug trafficking, and 
poverty, as well as the search for peace and economic growth 
with social justice for everyone. The Guatemalan president 
noted that guerrillas have been active in his country over the 
past 30 years. He said his government will resume talks with 
the rebels in mid-February in a search for peace in the only 
Central American country where an armed conflict persists. 
  De Leon Carpio said he hopes a peace agreement will be 
signed 
this year because a commitment has been made to the United 
Nations to achieve this goal. He also said that if the parties 
fail to reach an agreement, they would be showing a lack of 
commitment.

<F P=106> [Report from Santa Cruz de la Sierra] </F>
  [Excerpts] Government Minister German Quiroga today held a 
news conference to inform the public about the arrest of Isaac 
Chavarria Diez de Medina during a special operation by the 
Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) on 25 and 26 January. 
Quiroga also reported that 21 other people, allegedly members 
of one of the largest drug-trafficking rings in the country, 
also were taken into custody as a result of this drug 
enforcement operation. The minister noted that this constitutes 
a mortal blow to a gang that has been operating in Bolivia and 
other countries since the mid-70's thanks to the support of 
Colombian drug cartels. The gang led by Chavarria was not only 
engaged in selling thousands of kilograms of illegal drugs but 
also the laundering of millions of U.S. dollars. 
  Moreover, Meco Domingez' cooperation with police since he 
was 
arrested by police last December on drug trafficking charges 
played a decisive role as it enabled police to arrest these 22 
people. [passage omitted] 
  Chavarria's gang turned over 500 kg of drugs every 
fortnight. 
It is believed that the drug was processed in sophisticated 
laboratories located in some forested regions in El Beni 
Department. [passage omitted] 
  During this operation -- called Endless -- the FELCN 
conducted a mass roundup of alleged drug traffickers and seized 
14 properties and a large number of weapons, including rifles, 
shotguns, machine guns, grenades, and three radio transmitters. 
The names of the members of Chavarria's gang are: Alcides 
Isaac Chavarria Diez de Medina, top leader of the gang; Arturo 
Chavarria Catacora; Julia Saucedo de Chavarria, Alcides Isaac 
Chavarria's wife; Ilarion (Eigua Cordoba; Cristobal Salazar 
Cortez; Elmer Gutierrez (Nosti); Walter Velazco Eguez; Andres 
(Piso) Soto; Manuel Mercado Pammo; Fernando Anez Rojas; Eduardo 
Salvatierra Saavedra; Juan Saca (Adiran); Desiderio Rojas Cejas; 
Marta Cortez Salazar; and Isabel (Sanz) Roca, who were taken 
into custody at San Bonifacio ranch in El Beni Department. 
Other members, namely Miguel Alberto Losada Anez, Hugo Munoz 
Leanos, Juan Carlos (Peredo) Paz, Miguel Benquique, (Castulio) 
Salcedo, Elio Claros Rocha, and Julia Rodriguez were arrested in 
Santa Cruz de la Sierra. [passage omitted]

pressure from military leaders who demanded Paraguayan

obstructed. This is the information I have. I hope the permit 
will be granted to allow them to come. I do not see any 
unsuitability. It is said that the mission's hidden objective 
would have been the struggle against drug trafficking. If this 
is the case, I welcome it. [end recording]

  [Text] Christian Democratic Party (PDC) President Miguel 
Angel Montaner said that the U.S. offer to send a unit of 600 
military engineers to build schools in the country was 
questioned during President Juan Carlos Wasmosy's last meeting 
with political leaders. The main objection was that the social 
action offered in the package was small while the armed presence 
was very strong. 
  The political leader, who is a member of the president's 
official entourage currently touring Ecuador and Peru, said 
Ambassador Jon Glassman's offer on 10 January "was not laid out 
very well and probably will have to be brought up again or will 
be rejected." 
  What was laid out wrong? 
  It was really a request for social action, but a very small 
one, with very strong participation by U.S. armed personnel to 
carry out exercises, but not joint exercises with our troops but 
with Ministry of Public Work forces. We think the proposal was 
badly laid out because the promised social action is small. They 
propose building eight schools, a program that any parents 
association can undertake, and some eight artesian wells, all 
with a large military detachment. Their presence could create 
problems at a time we are consolidating our democracy. It is not 
convenient for the U.S. image as a leading democratic country 
and it is not convenient for the image we, Paraguayans, must 
have of ourselves. 
  Montaner said that as a result of a meeting at the 
presidential residence, "President Wasmosy has taken up the 
responsibility with a lot of integrity and without involving 
anyone. He has assumed the responsibility. I think the offer 
must be rejected. On the other hand, we can tell the Americans 
that we really need help fighting drug trafficking and 
implementing social action programs, but not with the proposed 
political style." 
  Asked if the president will reject the U.S. offer, Montaner 
said: "The proposal was made to the president of the Republic 
and he will be responsible for rejecting it."

  [Text] Brigadier General Marcial D. Samaniego, retired, the 
vice minister of defense, said yesterday that the arrival of 
U.S. troops will be senseless if the Paraguayan Armed Forces do 
not take part in the "Strong Roads 1994-South" exercises. 
Samaniego said that if the Paraguayan troops do not take part 
in this military exercise, the Armed Forces will ask the 
legislators not to approve the presence of 600 U.S. troops who 
will be in charge of building eight schools, one health center, 
roads and wells in the San Pedro department area. 
  The vice minister said: "We must take part in the training 
exercise. Otherwise the presence of the U.S. military will be 
senseless because the Paraguayan Armed Forces will be mere 
spectators while they train." 
  After stating that the number of U.S. troops (600) that will 
take part in the "Strong Roads 1994-South" exercise may raise 
suspicion, Samaniego said that the main objective of the U.S. 
troops "is not to build schools but to conduct deployment 
exercises." 
  The retired general warned that "if the Paraguayan Armed 
Forces are not directly involved in the operation we will have 
no control over the U.S. force." 
  Samaniego stated that this possibility must be taken into 
consideration by the legislators who must approve the entrance 
of U.S. troops into Paraguayan territory. He added: "I believe 
that the legislators will support our position. This is why I 
do not believe they will approve the presence of U.S. troops on 
those terms." 
  Samaniego said that the Armed Forces position is to 
negotiate 
Paraguayan participation in the exercises. He added that if the 
U.S. Government rejects this proposal, they will ask the 
legislators to reject the presence of U.S. troops. 
  During the interview, General Samaniego repeatedly insisted 
on the need for Paraguayan officers to participate in the 
military exercise. He stated: "This should be one of our 
prerquisites to allow the entrance of U.S. troops in our 
country. We should negotiate so that the Paraguayan Armed 
Forces can participate in an integrated manner in the exercise." 
  Samaniego said that a possible confirmation of the U.S. 
refusal to allow the Paraguayan Armed Forces participation in 
the task of building schools, roads, etc. will help to increase 
the existing mistrust about the true objective of the 600 U.S. 
troops that will arrive in the country. 
  Moreover, Samaniego explained that the U.S. military will 
spend more money in the mobilization and transportation of its 
troops than in builidng schools and roads. He added: "Of the 
$12 million that the operation will demand, construction 
constitutes but a small percentage."

  [Excerpt] Quito -- President Juan Carlos Wasmosy said he 
favors the privatization of all public companies in the country 
and of all public institutions and organizations with deficits. 
The president said this in exclusive statements to ULTIMA HORA. 
  The chief of state said that at first he did not agree with 
the privatization of the National Cement Industry (INC), but now 
he approves of the privatization of all public companies. 
  "The problem is that we are living with a budget we did not 
prepare. We did not have a manual to help us through the 
transmission like, for example, Bolivia. When we speak of 
privatizing the public companies we are not speaking of five 
companies. We will privatize everything except the Lopez 
Palace," the president said. 
  He added that the privatizations must not be carried out 
haphazardly, but that a special philosophy must be adopted for 
each case. "For example, in the case of the INC -- which is 
just one company -- some say that a small part of it should be 
privatized, some say only its administration should be 
privatized," he stated. 
  The president favors privatizing the INC but not its 
quarries, maintaining government control on that part of the 
activity. 
  Wasmosy said his government wants a social market economy 
and 
equal opportunities for all. 
  He mentioned the possibility of sending to Congress a 
general 
privatization bill to include both the public companies with 
deficits and all the public institutions without exception, 
specifying the privatization philosophy to be adopted in each 
case. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Tzvi Gilat] </F>
  [Text] "In a secret meeting between Israeli and Syrian 
representatives in Norway last October a joint, six-clause 
document was drafted. This document outlines Israeli and Syrian 
policy regarding a future peace agreement between the two 
countries." This was said by Dr. Yosi Olmert, an expert on 
Syria who participated in the meeting and was involved in the 
drafting of the document. 
  According to Olmert the contents of the document was brought 
to the knowledge of senior political circles, including Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, and raised a lot of interest and hopes 
in Jerusalem and Washington. Olmert notes the October meeting 
was the last in a series of six meetings organized by an 
American fund named "Common Ground Research Fund" [name as 
published]. 
  Olmert claims that due to leaks of the document no more 
meetings were held since October. 
  The Norway meetings were held under the auspices of 
Norwegian 
Foreign Minister Johan Jorgen Holst. Mr. Holst and his wife 
attended the opening of the meetings, which were held in the 
same Oslo castle in which the agreement of principles between 
Israel and the PLO was formulated. 
  The Israeli academics who participated in the meetings were: 
Professor Aharon Lev-Ran of the Jaffee Center for Strategic 
Studies, Dr. Dori Gold, Brigadier General (reserves) 'Amos 
Gilboa', and Dr. Yosi Olmert. The military commentator Ze'ev 
Schiff also attended one of the earlier meetings. 
  Two Syrians attended the meetings. One of them remains 
anonymous due to his sensitive position vis-a-vis the Syrian 
regime. The other is Professor 'Aziz Shuqri, dean of the 
Damascus University Law School. Shuqri, an expert of 
international renown, is known to be very close to the top 
Syrian political echelon. 
  "It is true that this was an academics' meeting, but the 
Syrian representatives can be seen to reflect the positions of 
the Syrian establishment," according to Olmert. Olmert claims 
that in a structured and rigid country like Syria people are not 
allowed to attend such meetings without the knowledge and 
authorization of the government. Syria, unlike Western states, 
does not have to take into consideration public opinion and the 
media. It does have a small group of persons, however, who are 
allowed to speak abroad and who serve as a sort of trial balloon 
for the future moves of the Syrian regime. The positions they 
express probably reflect the future positions of the Syrian 
regime. 
  Olmert reveals that an intensive 48-hour marathon of talks 
was held in Oslo last October which resulted in the joint 
document. This document caused a lot of interest in Israel due 
to several points: 
  -- This is the first time the Syrians have provided full 
details regarding their concept of peace. From the document it 
clearly transpires that the Syrians understand full peace to 
include open borders, normalization, economic, trade, and 
cultural relations, embassies and consular relations. 
  -- It is not stated in the document that during the 
withdrawal it will be necessary to evacuate all the Israeli 
settlements on the Golan Heights. It is stated that their 
status during the withdrawal will be subject to negotiations. 
  Two main points are not included in the document: 
  -- The duration of withdrawal. It is clear that there are 
substantial gaps between Syria and Israel regarding this point. 
The Syrians expect Israel to withdraw from the Golan Heights in 
three or four years; Israel unofficially believes the process 
should take much longer to complete. 
  -- Security arrangements. Obviously this issue will prove a 
future bone of contention between Israel and Syria if and when 
they enter concrete negotiations. It is assessed that Syria 
will agree to mutual demilitarization of territories, but will 
not agree to a deep demilitarization of all the area from the 
future international border to Damascus.

<F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Excerpts] The official reply of PLO Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat to the agreements made in Cairo last week were faxed to 
Israel in a two-page letter from Nabil Sha'th -- chairman of the 
Palestinian delegation for the committee on the implementation 
of the Gaza- and Jericho-First agreement -- to Sha'th's Israeli 
counterpart Major General Amnon Shahaq. 
  In the letter, Sha'th details Chairman 'Arafat's remarks 
regarding the border crossings and the territory of Jericho 
which were discussed in the Cairo meetings. At the conclusion 
of the letter, Sha'th asks Shahaq to meet him on 3 January in 
Taba to continue negotiations on other matters. 
  On the morning of 30 December, Sha'th sent a fax to 
Jerusalem 
in which he detailed the understandings made at the meetings of 
the Liaison Committee in Norway, France, and Egypt. The 
formulations were edited, but contained no substantive changes. 
In his second fax, sent in the evening of 30 December, Sha'th 
rejected the agreements described in the first fax, on 'Arafat's 
behalf. [passage omitted] 
  The PLO chairman demands that when Palestinian residents of 
the Gaza Strip and the Jericho region go through the border 
crossings, they are to be inspected at the Palestinian counter, 
and not even see Israeli officers and policemen when they enter 
the self-government district. He is willing to accept that 
residents of the West Bank, outside the Jericho region, undergo 
an Israeli inspection as well. [passage omitted] 
  'Arafat demands that a multinational force be present at the 
border crossings, and that a Palestinian policeman with a 
Palestinian flag be placed on the Jordan River bridges. 
[passage omitted] 
  In his reply, 'Arafat rejects the agreement regarding the 
size of the Jericho district, according to which the 
Palestinians will assume control over the Musa 'Alami farm, east 
of Jericho, the village of al-'Awja', and the Qarantal monastery 
-- a total of 55 square km. The Cairo agreement stipulates that 
the self-government will be given management rights over 
religious affairs at the al-Nabi Musa site and the right of 
pilgrimage under a Palestinian flag to the Muratas site of 
Jesus' baptism. The Cairo agreements also spoke of the 
establishment of joint projects on the Dead Sea shores. 
  'Arafat demands that all the places mentioned in the Cairo 
draft be subject to full "administrative control" of the 
Palestinian authority: al-Nabi Musa, the baptism site, and an 
area on the north western shores of the Dead Sea. 'Arafat also 
wants to connect the Jordan crossings to Jericho with routes 
that will have a special status. 
  In his letter, Sha'th refers to "crossings," and not just to 
the Allenby Bridge. Israeli sources have said that the PLO 
wants similar status on the Damiya Bridge and, in the future, on 
the 'Abdallah Bridge, the reconstruction and reopening of which 
is currently being discussed. [passage omitted]

  [Text] A senior political [Israeli] source said this 
morning that the new PLO compromise contains nothing that could 
advance the negotiations. He was referring to the offer Nabil 
Sha'th sent last night to Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, again 
by fax, since the prime minister said yesterday that everything 
should be presented in writing from now on. Jerusalem sources 
again explained that the talks will resume only on the basis of 
the Cairo agreements. Our political correspondent Udi Segal 
reports: 
  The recent Palestinian offer of compromise, relayed last 
night to Israel, includes nothing that could lead to progress in 
the negotiations, a senior Israeli political source said this 
morning. He was referring to the letter which Nabil Sha'th, 
Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser, faxed to Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres. The document arrived last night around midnight 
and included a Palestinian compromise offer, in a PLO attempt to 
renew the Taba talks this week. 
  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres reported the content of the 
offer to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. Israeli sources again 
stressed that the messages relayed to 'Arafat's aides, through 
their fax machines, were unequivocal: We are not willing to 
hold negotiations about the Cairo agreements which, from 
Israel's point of view, are a basis for the resumption of the 
Taba talks. 
  Israeli sources stated that over the past 24 hours, Egypt 
also played an important role in the contacts with the 
Palestinians, mostly held by fax. Regarding the ridiculous 
claims by Sha'th that the document presented after the Cairo 
talks was not an Israeli-Palestinian agreement, Israeli sources 
said: Do not ask us; ask Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa. 
He was with us in the same room. 
  Minister Yosi Sarid said that even the first document Sha'th 
sent to Rabin on 30 December -- which included amendments to the 
document formulated in Cairo -- indicates that a joint 
Israeli-PLO agreement was indeed made in Cairo. Had we wanted 
to write an Israeli position paper, Sarid said with a smile, I 
do not believe we would ask for an Egyptian or Palestinian 
advice. We could have done this alone at home.

  [Text] Cairo, Dec 30 (AFP)--The PLO has sent its own 
modified version of a working paper aimed at ending the deadlock 
on the launch of self-rule in the occupied territories, a 
Palestinian source said Thursday [30 December]. 
  The source, declining to be named, said the paper was the 
Palestinian version of a draft understanding, details of which 
were released earlier the same day in Israel. 
  If Israel accepts the latest document, the negotiations 
could 
result in agreement within two or three weeks, he said. 
  The PLO earlier denied Israeli claims that they had drawn up 
a draft agreement on launching Palestinian autonomy and said 
negotiators still had to hammer out an accord. 
  "We are trying in good faith to reach an agreement but, 
unfortunately, we have not reached it," said PLO negotiator 
Nabil Sha'th. 
  "We are going back to Taba in the old format of the 
negotiations," he told journalists, referring to the Egyptian 
Red Sea resort where the autonomy talks opened two months ago 
before moving to Cairo. 
  Egypt wound down its mediation efforts after a three-day 
meeting here of a liaison committee headed by Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres and executive committee member Mahmud 
'Abbas for the PLO. 
  Sha'th refused to comment on a draft understanding and said: 
"Our agreement was not to publish anything and anybody who is 
publishing anything is violating the agreement." 
  An Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank town of 
Jericho, under the September 13 autonomy accord, was to have 
started on December 13 but the deadline passed because of three 
main stumbling blocks. 
  The Palestine Liberation Organisation and Israel are at 
loggerheads over the size of Jericho, the control of 
international crossing points and security for Jewish settlers 
in the Gaza Strip. 
  According to Israel's draft, the size of an autonomous 
Jericho will be doubled from the original offer and the border 
crossings into Jordan and Egypt will be jointly manned but 
Israel would have the final say. 
  But PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat said Thursday in Amman that his 
organisation had rejected the Israeli draft.

<F P=106> [By Lamis K. Andoni] </F>
  [Text] Amman--The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) 
has asked for total control over crossing points to Jericho and 
Gaza and joint supervision of the other crossings with Israel as 
a compromise to break the deadlock over the implementation of 
Palestinian autonomy, PLO officials said on Friday [31 December]. 
  The PLO demands were included in counter proposals that 
Palestinian negotiator Dr. Nabil Sha'th has conveyed to the 
Israeli government. Israeli officials have already declared 
that the government could consider its original proposals, put 
forward in Cairo last week, but will not accept to scrap them. 
[sentence as published] 
  The new Palestinian proposals according to PLO officials, 
are 
the following: 
<H5>  The Crossings </H5>
  A: The Palestinian flag should be hoisted on all entrances 
to crossings points and borders. 
  B: Two separate crossing points to Jericho and Gaza, at 
King Husayn Bridge and Rafah respectively, totally controlled by 
the Palestinians. 
  C: Palestinian participation over the other crossing 
points. 
<H5>  Jericho </H5>
  A: [as published] The area of Jericho extends from al-Nabi 
Musa to al-'Awja reaching the King Husayn Bridge. According to 
a senior PLO official in Tunis, the Palestinians are giving 
priority to access between Jericho and the bridge over the area 
under consideration. 
  "According to the accord it is a matter of time before the 
Israeli withdrawal from the Jericho district. But if they had 
control over the bridge, Jericho would have been like a 
detention camp" for Palestinian leadership. 
<H5>  The Gaza Strip </H5>
  A: [as published] The Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip 
will be confined to the boundaries of the settlements only. 
  The Israeli proposals allow for Palestinian presence at one 
of two windows in one checking point around 500 metres inside 
the borders leaving the actual control in Israeli hands. 
  Furthermore, Palestinian travellers will have to be cleared 
by the Israeli window at the checkpoints before proceeding to 
the Palestinian window. 
  The Israeli plan also stipulates retaining control of "a 
three-metre-long security strip" between Jericho and the bridge. 
The Palestinian counter proposal flatly rejects it. 
  The city of Jericho, according to the Israeli proposal, will 
be connected with al-'Awja through a special narrow strip 
leaving all of the land around Jericho to the King Husayn 
Bridge, under Israeli control, while Palestinians will only 
administer the religious sites in al-Nabi Musa. 
  By confining Israeli control to within the boundaries of the 
settlements in the Gaza Strip, the PLO hopes to thwart Israeli 
attempts to connect the settlements in one "security zone." But 
some PLO officials warn that the Palestinians should not concede 
to Israeli demands to control land within the settlements' 
boundaries. "The land within the settlements' boundaries are 
controlled by Israel any way against our will," said one PLO 
official. "The settlements are illegal and we should continue 
to deal with them through the negotiations as such."

  [Text] Cairo, 31 Dec (MENA)--An informed Palestinian source 
in Cairo has said that the Palestinian leadership introduced 
some slight amendments to minutes of an agreement with Israel 
recently worked out in Cairo by the Palestinian and Israeli 
delegations discussing the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho 
Declaration of Principles. 
  In an exclusive statement to MENA, the source said most of 
the amendments concern the area of Jericho. The source said 
that the Israelis are sticking to their offer of 54 square km 
covering the Palestinian camps and some lands around Jericho 
city. 
  The source said the Palestinian amendments include the 
following: 
  First, al-Nabi Musa area should be under the supervision of 
the Palestinian authority. 
  Second, the al-Maghtis. The Israelis believe the area should 
not be part of the Jericho region during the interim stage, but 
the Palestinians want it to be under the Palestinian authority. 
The Israelis say the Palestinian flag cannot be raised over 
that area without annexing it. 
  Third, the Palestinians demanded the Musa al-'Alami area; 
the 
Israelis accepted this during the discussions. 
  Fourth, as regards al-Qurunful mountain, the Palestinians 
demand the right to approve joint Palestinian-Israeli projects 
there, and to approve projects with Jordan later. 
  Sixth [as received] The Palestinians demand that the 
international and foreign presence mentioned in the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles be extended to the 
border crossings. 
  The Palestinian source stressed that the amendments did not 
affect the essence of the agreement laid out through the joint 
working minutes. 
  The draft working paper reached between the Palestinian and 
Israeli delegations in Cairo included several issues on foreign 
security and arrangements relevant to the border crossings. 
  According to the border crossings arrangements, there will 
be 
one terminal for arrivals and departures with two doors, one 
Palestinian and one Israeli, separated by a glass barrier. 
Palestinians residing in the West Bank and Gaza will pass 
through the Palestinian door and then move to the Israeli door. 
Electronic inspection will be used in a manner respecting the 
dignity of those who pass through. 
  The Palestinian-Israeli draft on the crossings also says 
that 
each side has a right to see the identity cards of any traveler 
and veto the entry of any person. Each side will also report 
anything suspicious to the other. 
  The draft exempts public Palestinian figures from crossings 
procedures and stresses that when there is a need for personal 
inspection of Palestinians, the Palestinian side will do the 
inspection in the presence of an Israeli observer.

  [Text] Amman, AL-DUSTUR -- A senior Palestinian official 
has denied Israeli media reports that Mahmud 'Abbas, alias 
Abu-Mazin, had approved a draft agreement proposed by Israel on 
the question of the crossings, the area of Jericho, and the 
implementation of the Oslo accord. Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres presented the draft to the Palestinian delegation 
in Cairo last week. 
  The official said the Palestinian delegation told Peres it 
will convey these proposals to the Palestinian leadership to 
adopt an appropriate position. The Palestinian leadership 
rejected most of the proposals. 
  The official added that Israel tries, through its media and 
statements by its officials, to cause confusion among 
Palestinian ranks.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Nabil Sha'th, head of the </F>
Palestinian delegation, in Cairo, by Sa'id Mu'addi, in the 
studio, on 2 January--recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, good evening. 
  [Sha'th] Good evening to you. 
  [Mu'addi] You have been holding intensive consultations and 
contacts. You have received a letter from the Israeli foreign 
minister. What is it about? 
  [Sha'th] The foreign minister's letter was in reply to one 
from us on 30 December. He indicated he was prepared to return 
for another round of talks in Taba. However, he makes this 
return conditional on our acceptance of what he called the Cairo 
agreement. Actually, we are ready to return to complete these 
negotiations tomorrow to hammer out an integrated pact to 
implement the Declaration of Principles agreement. We made it 
clear to Minister Peres that there is no Cairo agreement in 
existence. There are working papers that were drafted in Cairo. 
We are bound by the points on which we reached agreement. As 
for the points on which disagreement persists, we are ready to 
discuss them in Taba. That is what negotiations are about. We 
consolidate what was agreed upon and the pending issues may be 
pursued if we went to Taba, hopefully soon. 
  [Mu'addi] The prime minister stated today that the document 
of understanding worked out in Cairo had the approval of the 
Israeli and Palestinian sides. 
  [Sha'th] Let met put the record straight: There is no such 
thing as a document of understanding from Cairo. Minister Peres 
knows as much. On the night of 28 December, he drafted minutes 
written in longhand. On the following day we received a draft 
far removed from the minutes. On the third day, I sent him a 
clarification of this memorandum, including the points on which 
we reached agreement in Norway. I have not yet received word 
from him indicating his approval of any of these formulas. None 
of these formulas amount to a document of understanding. One is 
labelled minutes, the second a draft, the third a working paper. 
We would like to know what is this Cairo document. These 
minutes were supposed to be sent to the leaderships of both 
sides for their approval. We sent them to the Palestinian 
leadership in Tunis, and they okayed part of them, and expressed 
reservations about the other parts. We want to return to Taba 
to talk about all these issues. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, what's next then? Is the Palestinian 
side waiting for the Israeli response? 
  [Sha'th] I have just sent our response to Peres, which is, 
by and large, positive. We are ready to return to the talks to 
pick up where we left off in Cairo. We are also bound by the 
Declaration of Principles. I hope the Israeli response will, 
this time, be positive. 
  [Mu'addi] Egypt's Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa said today the 
Taba talks may resume next Tuesday. 
  [Sha'th] That's fine by us. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, thank you so much. 
  [Sha'th] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Report on telephone interview with Nabil Sha'th, head of </F>
the Palestinian delegation, in Cairo, by Razi Barqay -- recorded 
"a short while ago" -- Sha'th's remarks recorded in English] 
  [Excerpt] [Barqay] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, the head of the 
Palestinian delegation, is busy in his Cairo office sending 
faxes to 'Arafat and receiving faxes from Jerusalem. In the 
course of our interview with him a short while ago, he received 
a facsimile from Shim'on Peres. We will return to this later 
but first we asked Sha'th about the draft that was formulated in 
Cairo. Why has 'Arafat gone back on his agreement? Nabil 
Sha'th replied that the reports of a joint paper were an Israeli 
fabrication. There was no such document. 
  [Sha'th] In fact, I do not know which paper Prime Minister 
Rabin is talking about. There were minutes that Mr. Peres 
dictated to his assistant Yoni [not further specified] in the 
meeting on 28 December. These minutes...[pauses] the next day 
we got a different draft from the Israeli side which differs 
significantly from it. And then, I sent a revised draft working 
paper to the Israeli side that I have not received any response 
on, so one wonders which agreement it is that Prime Minister 
Rabin is talking about. 
  [Barqay translates above remarks into Hebrew and continues] 
We only have a handwritten draft, Sha'th asserted, which has 
not even been signed. The word agreement does not even appear 
on the draft. We asked Sha'th what the disagreements were about. 
  [Sha'th] One, is about the size of the Jericho area. Number 
two is an issue related to the passages only in relation to the 
passage of residents of Gaza and Jericho; whereas we agree on 
all the rest of the modalities. 
  [Barqay translates above remarks into Hebrew and continues] 
We asked Sha'th to comment on 'Arafat's claim that Israel was 
only offering the Palestinians something akin to an Indian 
reservation. 
  [Sha'th] Whereas the Israeli side is always very sensitive 
about any symbol of sovereignty we talk about, like a passport 
or a postage stamp, we are also very sensitive about what we 
feel sometimes is an attempt to continue Israeli control of 
Palestinians in the occupied territories. Mr. 'Arafat's use of 
the word Bantustan for example, was as a result of his feelings 
that withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho should have given the Gaza 
and Jericho residents at least more freedom from direct Israeli 
control. Including of the crossing points. 
  [Barqay translates above remarks into Hebrew and continues] 
Does 'Arafat have the power to impose his control, we asked 
Sha'th? Most definitely, he replied. 'Arafat was and remains 
the boss. All the talk about a revolt are completely 
exaggerated. Then, while we were still talking, a facsimile 
arrived from Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. 
  [Sha'th] Would you hold on just a second. We have just 
received a letter from Mr. Peres and there is not a clear 
approval of going to Taba. In other words, he is still ready to 
hold the Taba negotiations but there is no specific date and I 
do not know if we are sure about the conditions for going back. 
Well, this may be clarified in a telephone call which I am 
going to make but as of now I see only a tentative approval that 
needs further confirmation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, Dec 31 (MENA)--The Palestinian-Israeli 
working paper which was reached by both sides was just a mere 
understanding and not an agreement, Palestinian Ambassador to 
Egypt Sa'id Kamal said today. 
  Thus, the paper called for presenting the text to both the 
Palestinian and Israeli leaderships, Ambassador Kamal told MENA. 
  Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat agreed that Taba 
committee's 
meetings would resume during next week, Ambassador Kamal further 
said. 
  Such a meeting was essential to formulate many issues 
regarding Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho and which 
were agreed on during the past two months, he added. 
  The Palestinians and Israelis could continue contacts to 
clear barriers which were still impeding the implementation of 
Gaza-Jericho peace accord, he said. 
  He reiterated the importance of the efforts exerted by 
President Husni Mubarak to surmount the difficulties impeding 
the execution of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of 
Principles. 
  The coming summit of 'Arafat and Israeli Premier Yitzhaq 
Rabin would take place by mid January at most in the light of 
the progress made by the negotiations, he said.

  [Text] Cairo, 2 Jan (MENA)--The Palestinians and Israelis 
are making intensive contacts with each other, both directly and 
via intermediaries, notably Egypt, to eliminate the 
misunderstanding between their leaders which have delayed the 
implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  Muhammad Subayh, secretary of the Palestine National 
Council, 
told MENA that the misunderstanding resulted from the fact that 
the contents of several documents that had been submitted were 
inaccurately conveyed to the leaders. 
  Subayh explained that the points raised by President Yasir 
'Arafat in connection with the Gaza-Jericho agreement are part 
and parcel of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles 
signed in Washington 13 September. 
  Subayh stressed that the Palestinians have a definite wish 
to 
implement the Gaza-Jericho agreement and they believe that the 
Israelis have the same wish.

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Arafat's political adviser Nabil Sha'th by </F>
MBC correspondent Mu'tazz al-Dimirdash in Cairo on 2 
January--recorded] 
  [Text] [Sha'th] The trip to Tunis by brother Dr. Haydar 
'Abd-al-Shafi and the criticism voiced in the territories now 
and then, constructive and otherwise, are the lawful right of 
the Palestinian people and all their leaders inside and outside 
the territories. This criticism indeed has nothing whatsoever to 
do with the recent crisis. In this crisis, all the Palestinian 
people stand by the negotiating delegation and the Palestinian 
leadership to establish the Palestinian rights. 
  [Al-Dimirdash] The crisis Dr. Sha'th is talking about is 
represented in the pressure the Israeli side is putting on the 
PLO to accept Cairo proposals. Are there new bases for resuming 
negotiations this time? 
  [Sha'th] Our constant and basic commitment is to the 
Declaration of Principles signed in Washington on 13 September. 
There is no specific document called the Cairo document. We 
worked out a document in Norway that outlined the points of 
agreement and disagreement. There is no similar document 
developed in Cairo. There were minutes dictated by Minister 
Peres. The next day, we received a document totally different 
from those minutes. We sent a correction and later sent 
Palestinian ideas. 
  [Al-Dimirdash] What is the PLO's stand on Rabin's hardline 
statements today, in which he implied that negotiations might 
not be resumed if the Palestinians do not accept the draft 
agreement? 
  [Sha'th] We do not accept ultimatums. If the Israelis halt 
negotiations, we will go back to the two sponsors who signed the 
agreement that should have been implemented on a specific date. 
The Israelis have shown no commitment until now. We do not 
want to escalate the situation. But we reject the Israeli 
escalation and want real negotiations that lead to an acceptable 
agreement.

<F P=106> [By Mona Salem] </F>
  [Text] Cairo, Jan 2 (AFP) -- The PLO said Sunday [2 
January] it rejected Israeli "blackmail" over the resumption of 
autonomy talks, after Israel warned that the organisation would 
first have to accept a disputed Cairo document. 
  "We are not involved in negotiations in which ultimatums can 
be issued," senior PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th told AFP. 
  "No side can accept such blackmail." 
  He said the "text presented by Israel as an accord is only a 
draft working paper drawn up by the Israeli delegation and on 
which the Palestinian delegation never gave its agreement." 
  But the Palestine Liberation Organisation is "serious in its 
desire to reach a solution to the problems as quickly as 
possible, if the other party shows the same will," he said. 
  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin warned earlier that his 
country would return to the autonomy talks only if the PLO 
accepted the document drafted by negotiators in Cairo. 
  "We are not in a hurry, it's the Palestinians' turn to sweat 
it out," Israeli state radio quoted Rabin as telling ministers 
at the weekly cabinet meeting. 
  The Palestinians have called for new negotiations in the 
Egyptian Red Sea resort of Tabah on Monday following 
recriminations over whether any agreement was made during 
negotiations in Cairo last week. 
  Israel announced Wednesday that the Palestinians had agreed 
to a draft document which would give joint control of border 
crossings and double the size of the autonomous area of Jericho 
to about 60 square kilometres (25 sq. miles). 
  But the PLO denied any accord and the Israeli press has 
reported that chairman Yasir 'Arafat is insisting on no Israeli 
presence at points where Palestinians will cross into the 
autonomous enclaves from Jordan and Egypt. 
  Israel alleged Palestinian negotiators had gone back on 
their 
word. 
  Israeli Environment Minister Yosi Sarid, who helped draw up 
the Cairo document, said: "It is not definite if the talks are 
to resume. 
  "If they are based on the understandings reached in Cairo, 
they can go on, but for the moment there is no basis to pursue 
them." 
  But Sha'th insisted that "only the paragraph concerning the 
Jericho zone represents common ideas" and that the Israelis had 
failed to take the Palestinians' views into account in the rest 
of the document. 
  The paper was intended to review both points of view but the 
Israelis left out "at least 60 percent" of what was verbally 
agreed by the two sides, said the Palestinian negotiator. 
  Implementation of the September 13 PLO-Israeli autonomy 
accord has been delayed by failure to agree mainly on the 
withdrawal of the Israeli army, the size of Jericho and control 
of crossings.

  [Text] Cairo, 2 Jan (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has 
stated that today he held contacts with Palestinian President 
Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, as well 
as with a number of European foreign ministers, to push forward 
the peace process and overcome the obstacles standing in the way 
of the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of 
Principles. Musa expressed the hope that an agreement will 
eventually be reached. 
  Musa said his meeting this evening with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, 
political adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, was 
part of the consultations that Egypt is holding. 
  Meanwhile, Dr. Nabil Sha'th said: We are working together to 
solve the problems and overcome the obstacles preventing an 
agreement so that we can return to the negotiating table in 
Taba. He added: The Israelis have raised an uncalled for and 
groundless furor about an agreement reached and on which the 
Palestinians have backed down. He said: As a matter of fact, 
no agreement had been reached. All that happened was that a 
working paper had been written and submitted to President Yasir 
'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin so that the 
points of agreement and disagreement could be marked on this 
paper to facilitate the work of the negotiators in Taba. 
  Sha'th stressed that the Palestinians are prepared to return 
to the talks but the Israeli side is still resorting to an 
escalation. Mr. 'Amr Musa and the Egyptian side are trying to 
resolve this problem so that we can return to the negotiations 
and accomplish what we have agreed to accomplish. 
  Asked whether the Palestinians have received a reply from 
Israel, Sha'th said: We have received a lengthy reply 
containing the Israeli stand vis-a-vis our stand. This is a 
normal matter.

  [Text] Amman (Petra)--Any solution to the Jordanian-Israeli 
conflict in the Arab-Israeli bilateral talks will inevitably 
have to address Jordan's water shortage problem, Mundher 
Haddadin, water expert and member of the Jordanian delegation to 
the Middle East peace talks, said Sunday [2 January]. 
  In an interview with the Jordan News Agency, Petra, Dr. 
Haddadin said article three of the agenda of the 
Jordanian-Israeli bilateral talks, which was concluded recently, 
states that both sides should get their legitimate share of 
water sources shared by them. 
  The issue will be discussed in official talks between the 
two 
sides as soon as the coming round of the Arab-Israeli bilateral 
talks starts, he said. 
  Dr. Haddadin said Jordan would focus in the negotiations on 
a 
sub-agenda which would include all the points related to the 
water of the al-Yarmuk and the Jordan Rivers. 
  Jordan, he said, has rights to international rivers it is 
sharing with other countries in accordance with international 
charters. But, he added, the Jordan River's tributaries in 
Jordanian territory, south of the al-Yarmuk River, are internal 
valleys whose water had been used since the 1950s to irrigate 
lands in the eastern Jordan valley. and thus, are considered 
Jordanian waters. 
  Reviewing Jordan's plans to exploit the Jordan River, Dr. 
Haddadin said Jordan has prepared a plan to use the river and 
its tributaries in 1939 and the plan aimed mainly at irrigating 
lands in the eastern Jordan Valley. The plan was updated in 
1950 for the same purpose. 
  On the other side of the river, before the establishment of 
Israel, the Jewish agency had drawn counterplans for the use of 
the Jordan River. Following the establishment of the Jewish 
state in 1948, Israel had drawn two more plans, he added. 
  The Israeli plans had always clashed with the Jordanian 
ones, 
and even the Israeli ambitions in Arab water had exceeded the 
borders of Palestine and included plans to use the al-Litani 
River in Lebanon, he said. 
  Dr. Haddadin noted that Israel draws water from the Jordan 
River to the Palestinian coast for agricultural projects and 
even to the Negev Desert to reform lands while the Jordanian 
water plans have only concentrated on the use of the river's 
water in the Jordan Valley basin itself. 
  Israel's attempts to control Arab waters continued after 
1967, when Israeli occupied the West Bank and the Golan Heights, 
and the Israelis put under their control most of the Jordan 
River's sources and tributaries north of Tiberias Lake, he said. 
  He added that Israel also managed to control the sources of 
the al-Yarmuk River after the 1967 war, thus violating all 
international standards and charters on the use of joint water 
sources.

<F P=106> [Address by PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat to the Palestinian </F>
people in the occupied territories and in the diaspora on the 
occasion of the 29th anniversary of the founding of the Fatah 
Movement -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. We have given thee a manifest victory, that God 
may forgive thee thy former and thy latter sins, and complete 
His blessings upon thee, and guide thee on a straight path, and 
that God might help thee with a mighty victory. It is He who 
sent down tranquility into the hearts of the believers, that 
they may add faith to their faith, for to God belongs the forces 
of the heavens and the earth, and God is full of knowledge and 
wisdom. [Koranic verse] God tells the truth. O sons of our 
great Palestinian people, O you activists, steadfast and 
mujahidin people for Palestine, O you the people of the valiant 
Intifadah, O you the heroes of the confrontation and resistance 
in exile and in the diaspora, O you the brave heroes who are 
patient and resilient in jails and detention centers, O you 
valiant eagles and courageous hunted men in every camp, village. 
and city; in every town, valley, and mountain in the land of 
beloved Palestine. Oh you the sons of our glorious Arab nation, 
in this glorious day, the anniversary of the outbreak of Fatah, 
the anniversary of the outbreak of the Palestinian revolution, 
in this day which marks the 29th anniversary of that glorious 
day, those rare historic moments when young people who have 
believed in their God and people have decided to open up the 
road to the beginning of a new stage for our people in the track 
of its struggle since the beginning of this century, on this 
day, on this glorious day, we mark this Palestinian national 
revolutionary anniversary in a new climate, in a new situation, 
and in the face of new prospects. 
  Today, after decades of bitter struggle, today, after 29 
years of a burning revolution, today after six years of the 
glowing Intifadah, today after long and bitter years of 
steadfastness, confrontation, and resistance in which we have 
given the price for Palestine in the form of the pains of our 
injured people, the freedom of our prisoners and the sorrow of 
our women, sisters, and daughthers, and the patience of our 
elderly people and men, and with the blood of our heroes, the 
cohorts of loyal martyrs, the brave sons of our people, today we 
miss them badly, those horsemen who have left their mounts 
early, the brave martyrs who have fallen on the road to freedom, 
liberation, and independence. 
  [Passage omitted] Our celebration today, oh my brothers, is 
different and set apart from any day in the past. On this day 
we stand with our relatives in the beloved homeland separated by 
only a few days from our appointment with history, from the 
appointed date for the beginning of the Israeli withdrawal from 
part of our land, from the appointed date for beginning of the 
return of thousands of our cadres and leaders to the homeland, 
from the appointed date for the establishment of the first 
Palestinian national authority for our people on the territory 
of their homeland in accordance with the resolution of our 
Palestinian National Council in 1974, from the date appointed 
for the new resurrection of the homeland of Palestine and the 
establishment of our Palestinian people on the political and 
geographical map of the region now that the attempt to wipe our 
mighty people from this map has ended forever. The people of 
Palestine are mighty, the people of Palestine are mighty. 
[passage omitted] 
  We have upheld the pledge and the oath. [passage omitted] 
  O sons of our great people, O sons of our glorious nation, 
by 
signing the Declaration of Principles agreement between the PLO 
and the Israeli Government, the cause of our people has entered 
a new historical and decisive phase. 
  This agreement included the beginning of the Israeli 
withdrawal from the Gaza strip and the Jericho region in 
connection with the redeployment of the Israeli forces in the 
rest of the occupied territories and the establishment of a 
Palestinian authority led by the PLO, the sole and legitimate 
representative of the Palestinian people; and the beginning of a 
transitional period followed in no more than three years by the 
negotiations of the final stage. The most important issues to 
be debated will be Holy Jerusalem, the old refugees, the 
settlements, the final borders, and the implementation of UN 
resolutions 242 and 338. 
  This agreement and the sweeping international support it 
produced, and the new realities it brought about, meant one 
single and basic fact, namely that the Palestinian people have 
firmly established their feet on the soil of their homeland by 
the effect of decades of the blessed Jihad and by the results of 
the bitter confrontations and the legendary steadfastness in the 
face of the expeditions of extermination and evil and by the 
effect of the legend of building and consolidating the national 
identity -- yes, by the effect of the legend of building, 
consolidating, and safeguarding the national identity in the 
diaspora and under the bayonets of occupation and in the heart 
of the detention camps and prisons, by the effect of the masses 
of our brave people, the architect of the epics of the unique 
struggle in the refugee camps in Lebanon and the architect of 
the epics of the heroic Fida'is operations and the tough 
resistance at al-Karamah [battle in Jordan where Palestinian 
resisted an Usraeli attack] and in the homeland's soil and the 
architect of the legendary epic in standing fast in the siege of 
Beirut and the architect of the independent Palestinian 
decisionmaking, the architect of the blessed and brave 
intifadah; Yes, the architect of the blessed and brave Intifadah 
in our occupied homeland, which dealt a finishing and final blow 
to the expansionist Zionist scheme. 
  By the effect of all this, events have built up day after 
day. The walls, one after another, and obstacles, one after 
another, have collapsed until Israeli recognition came to 
announce a new era of our people's history and of our genuine 
and loyal Jihad. [passage omitted] 
  Sons of our struggling people; brave and valiant women, men, 
children and youth in all positions inside and outside the 
homeland; our valiant wounded and our hero detainees; our 
glorious Arab nation: We are entering the new era full of hope 
without being deluded by chimeras. Yes, without being deluded 
by chimeras. We do so armed with faith and confidence. [passage 
omitted] The path is still long, but we have much food; the 
tasks are still many and difficult, but our positions are 
stronger and more advanced and more impregnable. [passage 
omitted] We say this so that we can realize our reality well 
and so that we can firm our footholds. The historic achievement 
that was realized does not mean in any way that our national 
tasks have been completed, as we still have before us the task 
of completing the comprehensive Israeli withdrawal from all the 
occupied territories, at the forefront of which is Holy 
Jerusalem, the capital city of our independent state in 
implementation of the resolutions of international legitimacy, 
so that our people can exercise their right to 
self-determination and establishing their independent state. 
Before us there still remains the main holy task of 
guaranteeing the rights of the Palestinian refugees in 
accordance with the principles and resolutions of international 
legitimacy, in addition to the issue of the settlements and the 
final frontiers. Out of our realization of all that, our 
central council made its decision that the PLO should be the 
point of reference as far as the national authority is concerned 
-- the national authority that will be established in the 
territories from which Israel will withdraw so that we can 
preserve the entity and role of the PLO in all that means of the 
unity of the people and the cause. 
  The political battle of negotiations that we have been 
waging, O sons of our great people, since 13 September to secure 
the precise and faithful implementation of the Declaration of 
Principles agreement is only a small sample of the obstacles 
that we are to face in the future. We are aware however of the 
fact that a historical step such as the one that has been 
achieved will have so many obstacles in its path due to the fact 
that it has taken place following decades of tenacious 
confrontation, war, aggression, and occupations. 
  We stress that we look at the Declaration of Principles as a 
first step on the path toward achieving a comprehensive peace 
that would not acquire its full meaning before the 
implementation of all the UN resolutions, the Israeli 
withdrawal, and the recovery of Arab rights on all fronts. 
Approaching is our great concern for Arab coordination, which 
we consider as a necessary condition for the consolidation of 
the stand of the Arab negotiator [as heard] especially after the 
Declaration of Principles brought about a change that bridged 
the gap between the Palestinian track and the rest of the Arab 
tracks in terms of time as dictated by the requirements of the 
peace process in Madrid. [passage omitted] 
  We would have wished greater size and quicker pace for the 
programs of support. [passage omitted] 
  We, while crossing the threshold of the new era in our 
history, fully realize how this moment is so special and unique; 
we realize its difficulties. Allow me to say to you that the 
anxiety we all are feeling, where hopes mix with fears, progress 
with hesitation, and emotions with wisdom and consideration, is 
natural. Yes, my brothers, this is a natural matter. In fact, 
it is evidence that everything is alright and healthy as far as 
our entity and society are concerned. [passage omitted] It is 
the moment of the beginning of the process of the realization of 
our national aims; it is the moment of the beginning of the 
revival of a new Palestine. 
  It is the moment of the meeting of our masses inside with 
their revolution and people in the diaspora. It is the moment 
of the beginning of the construction of the Palestinian national 
entity on the land of Palestine. We have to realize full well 
the requirements of this moment so that our steps will be 
precise and correct and so that we can advance toward the 
completion of our aims. [passage omitted] We want the Palestine 
that is being revived anew to be a homeland that realizes for 
the people of Palestine their dreams, hopes, and aspirations -- 
a homeland that will realize the aims for which we have 
struggled; a homeland that will compensate our masses for 
continuous decades of injustice and oppression, which were the 
result of the historic crime and injustice carried out against 
us. We want it to be a free homeland for a free people and for 
strugglers; a modern and advanced entity; democratic, and a 
model that makes available the opportunity for the continuation 
of the civilized role and religious and cultural heritage that 
Palestine had throughout history; an oasis in which our people 
will enjoy freedom, democracy, political pluralism, security and 
safety, the independence of the judiciary, the preservation of 
public freedoms, stability, prosperity, human rights and 
equality between men and women. 
  A homeland for the Palestinians wherever they may be, 
getting 
ready for the time when our objectives are achieved with the 
[military] evacuation of our holy Jerusalem and the whole of 
this homeland, the land of holiness and prophets and the place 
of the ascension of our prophet Muhammad and the birthplace of 
Jesus, is completed [sentence as heard]. 
  My brothers, beloved, comrades of the path and the march, 
and 
brothers of struggle and Jihad, the enormity of the sacrifices 
we are facing is relative to the size of our dreams and hopes, 
our determination and persistence, the strength of our belief 
and will. We are starting from the reality of destruction that 
years of occupation have inflicted on the infrastructure of our 
economy and society. [passage omitted] 
  On this occasion and on this historic day I address an 
appeal 
to all the sons of our Palestinian people -- in all its sectors 
and groupings everywhere; in all its detachments, forces, 
parties, trends, personalities, and activities -- saying to them 
all that the hour of the major jihad has struck -- the hour of 
building the national entity to consolidate our capability to 
complete the wresting of all our national rights -- this hour is 
for unity and not for disunity, and this hour is for harmony 
that concentrates on the common denominators and not an hour for 
division that looks for contradictions and differences. Come; 
come, let us together and hand in hand and side by side wage our 
holy battle by building the national Palestinian entity. Come, 
let us agree on what we agree upon. Let some of us pardon 
others on what we differ upon. Come, let us agree and disagree 
under the umbrella of what unites us -- under the umbrella of 
the sublime national interest of our people and homeland and 
nation. [passage omitted] 
  O sons of our great people, this new year is that of the 
renaissance. Here is Palestine being reborn again as a national 
entity on its way to becoming an independent state. [passage 
omitted] 
  In this year, it is our duty to consolidate our rank and 
mobilize our energies to be at the level of the challenges 
facing us. This is the year of great tasks, and the year of 
achievements that we are undertaking from new stands, with new 
spirit. It is the year of the free people who are making a free 
homeland and a new torch of light, hope, and faith in the 
region. [passage omitted] 
  It is a revolution until victory, until victory, until 
victory. Your brother, Abu 'Ammar.

<F P=106> [Speech by Yasir 'Arafat, chairman of the PLO Executive </F>
Committee, on the occasion of the 29th anniversary of the 
founding of the Fatah Movement, "this morning" at the martyrs 
cemetery in Boukornine, Tunisia--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] On this day, the first of 
January, the day of the Palestinian revolution, the day of 
Fatah, the day of the Palestinian people, the day of all free 
and noble people in the Arab nation, on this day the first 
bullet was fired by the blessed vanguard of the Arab nation to 
declare to the whole world that the Palestinian people are a 
people of history and honor. They are a mighty people, they are 
a mighty people, yes, they are a mighty people. 
  When these bullets were fired to announce a rebirth of this 
people, they were telling the Zionist and imperialist plot that 
it could not remove this people from the annals of history as 
international Zionism and imperialism had tried to do, as the 
Zionists and imperialists had tried to do. They had tried to 
erase this people from the annals of history. Let us remember 
what the Zionists and imperialists said: A land without people 
[Palestine] for a people without a homeland [the Jews]. 
  [Passage omitted] O my brothers, my beloved, we are now in 
the midst of a political battle of negotiations. It is 
ruthless, ruthless. However, at the same time it crowns the 
blessed intifadah, which is still burning over our Palestinian 
land. 
  I am telling you that together we will confront all these 
attempts and all these plots. Let Rabin and Peres be aware that 
no one among the Palestinian people will kneel down or submit. 
They may be able to continue occupying this land but no one can 
humiliate or dishonor the Palestinian people; they are a great 
people, a great people. 
  Therefore, brothers, the pledge remains the same. Honorable 
martyrs, the pledge remains the same and the oath remains the 
same. We will continue on this path until the Palestinian flag 
is hoisted; until the Palestinian flag is hoisted by our new 
generals, the children of the stones, over the walls of 
Jerusalem, the mosques of Jerusalem, and the churches of 
Jerusalem. They see it as distant but we see it as close. We 
are sincere. [passage omitted] 
  O brothers, beloved, beloved, O beloved martyrs, O martyrs 
who are more honorable than us, the pledge, yet again, the 
pledge, the pledge remains the same and the oath lremains the 
same. Together and side by side until we reach Palestine 
[repeats], until we reach Jerusalem [repeats four time]. 
Together until victory, victory, victory.

  [Text] Brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], president of the 
state of Palestine and chairman of the PLO's Executive 
Committee, has stressed that this year will be the year of 
revival: Here is Palestine being revived as a liberated 
homeland for free men--the honorable, strugglers, and 
revolutionaries; a homeland for democracy; a modern homeland and 
a homeland for human and individual liberty. 
  Speaking on the telephone to the people of Jericho 
celebrating the 29th anniversary of the founding of the Fatah 
Movement and the intifadah entering its seventh year, brother 
Abu-'Ammar said that no one could erase the Palestinian people 
from the annals of history or the region's geographical and 
political map. 
  He added: We have decided to make peace with our enemy, but 
they are trying to prevaricate and say that deadlines are not 
sacred. I am saying: No, deadlines are sacred, and he who 
signs something must respect it. I am telling them that 
prevarications cannot affect the determination of the 
Palestinian people, because this people's determination comes 
from God; God wills what His soldiers want. 
  Yes, they will not be able to undermine our determination 
and 
will not be able to outmaneuver us. We have signed an agreement 
and they must respect it. The conference sponsors, Russia and 
America, signed with us under the auspices of the President of 
the United States and under the patronage, before the eyes, and 
with the blessing of the whole world. I am saying this so that 
it will be clear to those who are near by and those who are far 
away. 
  Brother Abu-'Ammar said: By signing the Declaration of 
Principles between the PLO and Israel, we brought our people to 
a new and decisive historical era. This agreement, inclusive of 
its contents from the start of the Israeli withdrawal from the 
Gaza Strip and the Jericho area, absolutely did not mean 
redeployment. Withdrawal means withdrawal. But there is 
redeployment in other areas, in addition to the establishment of 
national authority under the leadership of the PLO in 
implementation of our Palestinian National Council's decision in 
1974, which stipulated the establishment of national authority 
on any part of the Palestinian soil being liberated or from 
which the Israelis withdrew. 
  Brother Abu-'Ammar affirmed that Holy Jerusalem was in our 
hearts and eyes and we would not compromise on it. 
  On the issue of the refugees and the settlements, Brother 
Abu-'Ammar pointed out that the issue of the emigres was 
entrusted to a committee from our Jordanian and Egyptian 
brothers, Israel, and the PLO to arrange for their return. The 
fate of the refugees would be determined in a period not 
exceeding three years, that the same applies to the settlements 
and their removal, and the final borders of the state of 
Palestine. 
  Brother Abu-'Ammar affirmed that we will not live in 
homelands or ghettos, and nobody can ever humiliate the 
Palestinian people. If Rabin thinks that he can humiliate the 
Palestinian people, he is mistaken. He can continue occupying 
the land, but he is incapable of humiliating a Palestinian 
child, woman, man, or youth. 
  'Arafat said that with this agreement we have firmly 
established the Palestinian people on the geographical and 
political map of the Middle East. He said: Do not forget that 
the Zionists said at the first Zionist Congress in Basel, 
Switzerland in 1897: A Land Without a People for a People 
Without a Land. No, this land has the Palestinian people in it, 
and we are planted in the Palestinian land like Palestinian oak 
trees; our ancestors and their bones are in it, we are in it, 
and our children will be in it. 
  At the end of his address Abu-'Ammar urged the audience and 
all Palestinians to unite. He said: Unity, unity, unity for 
all the sons of Palestine, for all the generals of Palestine, 
and all the organizations of Palestine. Together we will make 
the homeland and together we will build this homeland; a 
homeland for all freemen and the honorable regardless of their 
affiliations, parties, or identities. We have a rendezvous with 
dawn; we have a rendezvous with victory.

  [Text] Brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], president of 
the state of Palestine and PLO Executive Committee chairman, has 
said that he remains optimistic the differences with Israel 
concerning the implementation of the Declaration of Principles 
can be worked out. His remark came in an interview with the 
Britith Sky Television network screened last night. The 
disagreements between the PLO and Israel should not stand in the 
way of implementing the Gaza-Jericho accord, 'Arafat stated. It 
is an international document the signing of which was witnessed 
by the cosponsors of the Middle East peace process, President 
Bill Clinton, and the whole world, he noted.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" telephone interview with PLO Executive </F>
Committee Chairman Yasir 'Arafat by Sufiya 'Amarah; place and 
date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] ['Amarah] Mr. Chairman: What would you say to the 
Palestinian people on the new year? 
  ['Arafat] I would like to tell all Palestinian children, 
women, and men that Palestine is being resurrected anew as a 
beautiful homeland for each of our children, a free homeland for 
each of the Palestinian men. None of these men has abandoned 
sacrifice. Palestine now stands as a prosperous and fair hope 
for each of the Palestinian women who are protecting our 
existence, safeguarding our everlasting fire, maintaining the 
glowing spirit, and carrying the secret of eternal 
steadfastness. Palestine will be a homeland in which the 
children of Palestine, who are our new generals, will hoist the 
Palestinian flag on the land of Palestine, and on the walls, 
churches, and minarets of Jerusalem. It will be a homeland for 
free men who will create a free homeland and a new torch of 
light, hope, and faith. 
  ['Amarah] Mr. Chairman: In a message to a U.S. Jewish 
leader, you said Israel wants to turn the Gaza Strip and Jericho 
area into an Indian reservation. Does this mean that the 
agreement, according to the Israeli viewpoint, cannot be 
accepted by the Palestinian people? In this case, what will be 
the alternative, or the path the Palestinian leadership will 
take, in order to meet the Palestinian people's demands? 
  ['Arafat] It should be understood that we signed a peace 
[agreement] between the PLO and the State of Israel. Thus, 
Israel should honor its signature. I only demand an honest and 
precise implementation of what we signed. 
  ['Amarah] What if implementation does not happen? 
  ['Arafat] If you please, withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho 
means withdrawal, not redeployment. This should be understood 
by everyone everywhere. We will not live in a ghetto or in a 
bantustan. They should understand this matter. Therefore, we 
will never accept these conditions, which Rabin and others try 
to impose on the Palestinian people. I want to tell Rabin that 
he should honor what he signed, and that implementation should 
be accurate and literal. 
  ['Amarah] What if this does not happen? 
  ['Arafat] Let the world answer this question. This 
agreement was also signed by the Russian and U.S. cosponsors of 
the conference, under the supervision of President Clinton. The 
entire world witnessed the signing of this agreement. I want to 
tell Rabin: You can continue your occupation of our land for 
another period of time. However, Rabin should understand that 
he cannot at all impose on us injustice or humiliation. None of 
the children of Palestine will accept the humiliation they are 
trying to impose on us. They have been occupying our country 
for 45 years. They could continue to occupy it for 47, 48, or 
50 years, but they will never be able to humiliate the 
Palestinian people. There is a powerful people in Palestine. 
This should be understood. I believe our children, whom I call 
the new generals, can confront this Israeli arrogance. 
  ['Amarah] Mr. Chairman: President Mubarak is seeking to 
bridge the gaps separating the PLO and Israeli positions. How 
successful has he been? 
  ['Arafat] Let me here thank my brother His Excellency the 
struggler President Muhammad Husni Mubarak for the considerable 
efforts he has been and is exerting in pursuit of a just and 
comprehensive peace in the region and to promote a faithful and 
accurate implementation of the accord. At the last round, 
convened by the Liaison Committee under Peres and my brother 
Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas], my brother Egyptians did a fine job, 
with their foreign minister taking time off for this thing, and, 
instructed by President Mubarak, he did not spare himslef. I 
take this opportunity to thank them for their time and effort. 
  ['Amarah] The delay in implementing the accord has 
apparently 
led to increased Palestinian opposition, even within the Fatah 
ranks. How do you feel about that? 
  ['Arafat] Who said we mind opposition? I do not think a 
single Palestinian would allow me to agree to humiliating terms, 
against the wishes of the Palestinian people to set up a 
national authority on the first Palestinian territory, where a 
Palestinian flag will fly over the first Palestinian land to be 
liberated from occupation. I have no doubt that all Palestinian 
men, women, and children stand by me to defend the Palestinian 
people, dignity, and sanctities, most of all Jerusalem, the 
capital of the state of Palestine. Do you think I rule over 
sheep? 
  ['Amarah] No. 
  ['Arafat] I am responsible for free and mujahid strugglers, 
each of whom is entitled to his or her own opinion. Let me 
quote 'Umar Bin-al-Khattab [the second khalif after Prophet 
Muhammad]: Blessed be the person who has corrected 'Umar. 
  ['Amarah] Rabin said that 13 December, on which Israel's 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho was to have started, is not a 
sacrosanct date. He now says the 13 April deadline for 
completing the Israeli withdrawal is not sacred, either. What 
do you think? 
  ['Arafat] This says something about the Israelis. Are they 
men of their word? Do they honor the agreements to which they 
put their signatures? Let them be judged by the world. 
  ['Amarah] Mr. Chairman, do you believe that the 
Clinton-al-Asad summit in Geneva will help the implementation of 
the Palestinian-Israeli agreement? Do you think this submit 
will activate the peace process in the Middle East, especially 
on the Syrian-Israeli track? 
  ['Arafat] No doubt, this summit was arranged in such a way 
as 
to be a basic pillar for proceeding on the Syrian-Israeli track. 
Undoubtedly, this summit will facilitate movement on other 
tracks. I wish this summit meeting success, so we can actually 
proceed together in order to establish a just and comprehensive 
peace in the region--peace that preserves the Arab nation's 
dignity, existence, and rights. 
  ['Amarah] Israel and the Vatican yesterday signed an 
agreement which was described as historic. This agreement has 
ignored the Jerusalem issue. How do you evaluate this 
Israeli-Vatican agreement? 
  ['Arafat] It does not (?mean) an agreement on Jerusalem 
simply because the Vatican is aware that Jerusalem is not an 
Israeli responsibility. Jerusalem is a Palestinian, Arab, 
Islamic, and Christian responsibility. 
  ['Amarah] How do you view Israel's announcement that it is 
not in a hurry to implement the agreement? 
  ['Arafat] Wind cannot shake a mountain. We are not shaken by 
a statement here and a statement there. Our steps are firm. 
  ['Amarah] Mr. Chairman, can you address a message from Radio 
Monte Carlo to all the listeners and the steadfast people in the 
West Bank? 
  ['Arafat] I would like to tell all the Palestinian children 
and women from the bottom of my heart and conscience that this 
new year is the year of resurrection. Palestine is resurrected, 
a national entity on the road to an independent state. It is 
the year of the harvest. After years of struggle and 
sacrifices, we are having our aims materialize on our national 
soil. In this month and in this year, the month of the 
nocturnal journey of the prophet to heaven, the month of the 
Palestinian revolution, the emergence of Fatah, the revolution 
of all the noble and free men in the Arab nation, this month and 
this year will witness the beginning of the new historical era 
for our people. This year will be the year of freedom for all 
our heroic detainees, the knights whose heroism built our 
historic achievement. To all our faithful martyrs, I say: 
Peace be on your chaste souls, our brothers, comrades, beloved 
ones, and leaders--Abu Jihad, Abu-Iyad, Abu-'Ali Iyad, 
Abu-al-Walid, Abu-al-Hawl, Majid Abu-Sharar, Abu-Yusuf, Kamal 
'Adwan, Abu-Sabri, 'Abd-al-Fattah (Nur), Kamal Nasir, Ghassan 
Kanafani, Nazzal, and the many other leaders, cadres, and 
martyrs fighters who have continued the fight of al-Qassam, 
'Abd-al-Qadir al-Husayni, and Hakam Salamah and other heroes who 
fell in defense of Palestine and Jerusalem. I tell them: The 
clock has chimed: Victory for us and freedom for Palestine. In 
the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate, and we wished 
to be gracious to those who were being depressed in the land, to 
make them leaders in faith, and make them heirs and to establish 
a firm place for them in the land. And those who strive in our 
cause, we will certainly guide them to our paths; for verily God 
is with those who do right. [Koranic verses]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, in </F>
Tunis, by 'Abdallah Zalatah, in Cairo, carried on the "Dialogue 
from Afar" program, date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Zalatah] Welcome, Mr. President. 
  ['Arafat] Thank you. 
  [Zalatah] Mr. President, what is the status of the 
negotiations following the recent discussions in Oslo, Paris, 
and Cairo? 
  ['Arafat] The situation, I am sorry to say, is nearly frozen 
because of the Israeli attitude, which seeks to impose 
conditions on the Palestinians outside the context of the signed 
agreement. When we speak of withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, 
the term withdrawal must be respected. It must not be a 
redeployment [preceding word in English] but a withdrawal. And 
a second point: We do not want to live in a ghetto or a 
bantustan with the Israelis closing and controlling the existing 
roads. When they speak of withdrawal, it must mean exactly 
that. In security matters, they must understand that this is 
not a one-way street. Security applies both ways, our own 
security and their security. This must be understood. If they 
are trying to force an unsound interpretation of the agreement, 
they must know that such talk will not find willing ears among 
the Palestinians, Arabs, other free and honorable people in the 
world, or the sponsors of the peace conference who signed the 
agreement with us. 
  [Zalatah] Mr. President, what is Your Excellency's 
impression 
of Egypt's role in trying to surmount the existing obstacles? 
  ['Arafat] First of all, I wish to express my heartfelt 
thanks 
to His Excellency the struggler President Muhammad Husni Mubarak 
for all the worthy efforts he has been making to ensure that 
this agreement works. He worked to bring the agreement into 
existence and is now helping to see it implemented. We can 
never forget the role of his excellency the president. He has 
also instructed his foreign minister to devote his attention 
almost entirely to the Palestinian-Israeli Liaison Committee 
meetings. For some time he has been preoccupied with this 
issue, devoting himself to it. We thank him very much for this. 
  [Zalatah] President 'Arafat, what is the joint working paper 
to which Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said he would 
accept no amendments? 
  ['Arafat] I am sorry to say that Rabin appears not to have 
been accurately briefed by his delegation on what happened. The 
understanding was that these points were points for discussion, 
not an agreement. The assumption is that these points will be 
submitted to the Israeli and Palestinian leaders. However, I 
was surprised--I regret to say--when they called them points of 
agreement. They absolutely must not circumvent the facts and 
the agreements. The Egyptian brothers, who have been following 
these developments, can testify that we agreed to state our 
views on these points, with the understanding that they would 
serve as an agenda for the discussions. The ideas were 
submitted by them, not by the Palestinians. 
  [Zalatah] Mr. President, if we summarize the Palestinian 
stance in several specific points, what would they be? 
  ['Arafat] I want to say one thing. The agreement mentions 
withdrawal. Withdrawal means exactly that, not redeployment. 
Regrettably, they are unable to understand what withdrawal 
means, or they understand it but are trying to sidestep it. 
This is impermissible. When we speak of withdrawal, it must 
mean exactly that. It is impermissible for them to turn the 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho into a redeployment. Another 
point is this: We are going back to liberated territory in Gaza 
and Jericho. What must be implemented in these areas is the 
final status, not the transitional phase. Therefore, just like 
any reasonable person, I cannot acquiesce to their attempt to 
make us live in a ghetto or a bantustan and to close the exit 
points around us. Is this reasonable? No Palestinian will 
accept such a situation. According to the Israeli administrative 
division, the area of Jericho District is 712 sq km. How can 
they offer us 27 sq km and then kindly condescend to offer us 55 
sq km? Regrettably, they view this as a great favor to us and 
act as if they are conceding to us our own land. 
  More than that, things reached the point of telling us that 
we are only entitled to hold [Christian] religious rites in 
al-Maghtis Christian area [where Jesus Christ was baptized]. 
Who could accept this? As for Muslims, their religious rites 
are to be held in Maqam al-Nabi Musa area. Who says this? Do 
they think they are doing us a favor? Is such a mentality 
acceptable? And they also do not want us to supervise the area 
between Jericho the three bridges [on the Jordan River]. What 
does that mean? Will we be entering a ghetto? This is really 
strange. We added Jericho to Gaza; Gaza because it borders on 
Egypt and is linked to our brothers in Egypt; and Jericho 
because it is connected to Jordan and the brothers in Jordan. 
But they [the Israelis] want to impose on us their own concept; 
and God knows from where they got this concept. As for the 
international presence, it is an "international presence" [last 
two words in English]. This means a temporary international 
presence during the interim period. Now they say that they 
cannot accept an international presence. This is really 
strange, because it is specified in the agreement. 
  [Zalatah] But the Palestinian side welcomes an international 
presence? 
  ['Arafat] Absolutely. I asked the brother Egyptians, brother 
Jordanians, brothers and friends in Europe, the Americans, the 
Russian cosponsors to come and be with me. I tell you my 
brother: I am ready to accept the force that is present in 
Sinai. But their logic is very strange. They interpret the 
agreement in a way that serves their interests, not a way that 
suits the interests of both parties. 
  [Zalatah] President 'Arafat: Could we say that a meeting 
between you and Rabin in the coming few days has become 
difficult to pull off? 
  ['Arafat] Of course it has become difficult, until he is 
convinced that the implementation of the agreement must be 
accurate, honest, and literal. 
  [Zalatah] What about a resumption of talks between you and 
the Israelis? 
  ['Arafat] At any rate, we are thinking about it now. There 
is a proposal to resume the talks of one of the committees in 
Taba. The Palestinian leadership will study this proposal, God 
willing, and respond to it. 
  [Zalatah] As we end our dialogue, would you like to send a 
message to the brothers in the occupied territories? 
  ['Arafat] I would like to tell our great people, the 
steadfast people struggling for the sake of Palestine, the 
valiant people of the intifadah, the heroes of confrontation in 
the territories and the diaspora, the patient and steadfast 
heroes in the detention camps and prisons, the valiant hawks and 
noble people being pursued in every camp, village, city, 
township, valley, and mountain on the beloved land of Palestine, 
and to the entire Arab homeland: I tell them on this day, the 
anniversary of the outbreak of Palestinian revolution and the 
anniversary of Fatah; on this day and in this month, the month 
marking the Prophet's journey to heaven; I tell them that we 
have an appointment with dawn. We have an appointment with 
victory. We have an appointment to write on the history books 
for our Arab world that nobody can obliterate the Palestinian 
people from the map of the Arab world and the Middle East. The 
Palestinian people have become a tough and fundamental factor in 
the political and geographical equation. In 1897, the Jews 
talked about Palestine as a land without a people for a people 
without a homeland. No. The Palestinian people are deep-rooted 
in their land. To all this, I say to all our noble brothers and 
comrade martyrs that the pledge remains the same and the oath 
remains the same. We have an appointment with dawn, we have an 
appointment with victory, we have an appointment with the state 
of Palestine. 
  "So lose not heart, nor fall into despair: for ye must gain 
mastery if ye are true in faith." "On that day shall the 
believers rejoice with the help of God. He helps whom He will, 
and He is exalted in might, most merciful. It is the promise of 
God. Never does God depart from His promise: but most men 
understand not." [Koranic verses] 
  God willing, a child from my country, a general from the 
generals of [word indistinct] will raise the Palestinian flag 
over the walls, minarets, and churches of Jerusalem. "And to 
enter your Temple as they had entered it before." [Koranic verse] 
  [Zalatah] President 'Arafat: We thank you very much and we 
welcome you always on the Voice of the Arabs. 
  ['Arafat] We will soon pray together in Jerusalem brother 
'Abdallah, God willing. 
  [Zalatah] God willing. Thank you.

  [Text] Tunis, Dec 31 (AFP) -- PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat 
said late Thursday [30 December] that Jordan's King Husayn had 
affirmed his support for the Palestinian position in talks with 
Israel on the autonomy accord. 
  'Arafat arrived back in Tunis after stopping off in Amman to 
see Husayn following a visit to Cairo during which he met with 
Egyptian leaders for talks on implementing the Israeli-PLO 
accord signed in Washington in September. 
  'Arafat told the Palestinian agency WAFA that King Husayn's 
support came at "one of the most important moments in the 
Palestinian cause". 
  The PLO has sent Israel its own modified version of a 
working 
paper aimed at ending the deadlock on the launch of the accord, 
a Palestinian source said earlier Thursday in Cairo. 
  The source, declining to be named, said the paper was the 
Palestinian version of a draft understanding, details of which 
were released earlier the same day in Israel. 
  During the two-hour meeting at Amman airport, 'Arafat and 
King Husayn "consolidated Palestinian-Jordanian coordination in 
all matters", the PLO leader said. 
  A meeting is now to be held next week to determine the kind 
of coordination between the two countries. 
  'Arafat said his meeting with the Jordanian king would give 
a 
"new impulse" to bilateral relations, highlighting that the 
Palestine Liberation Organisation was anxious "to widen and 
improve the level of these relations". 
  According to a Palestinian source the two sides agreed to 
reactivate a joint commission to meet in Amman next week. 
  An Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank town of 
Jericho, under the September 13 autonomy accord, was to have 
started on December 13 but the deadline passed because of three 
main stumbling blocks. 
  The PLO and Israel are at loggerheads over the size of 
Jericho, the control of international crossing points and 
security for Jewish settlers in the Gaza Strip. 
  According to Israel's draft, the size of an autonomous 
Jericho will be doubled from the original offer and the border 
crossings into Jordan and Egypt will be jointly manned but 
Israel would have the final say. 
  But 'Arafat said Thursday in Amman that his organisation had 
rejected the Israeli draft.

  [Text] Amman--AL-WATAN has learned from informed 
Palestinian sources that a high-level Palestinian delegation 
will arrive in Amman this week, and that the delegation will 
sign Jordanian-PLO economic agreements that have been finalized 
by special bilateral committees. 
  This official visit will come on the heels of recent talks 
held between His Majesty King Husayn and the Palestinian 
president, during which the Palestinian side affirmed its 
concern to maintain the special Palestinian-Jordanian 
relationship regardless of the impediments entailed. 
  In a separate development, Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam 
al-Majali received at his office yesterday Dr. George Habash, 
secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine, who arrived in Amman the day before yesterday. 
  AL-WATAN has learned that there is currently a consensus 
within the Palestinian side, particularly the PLO leadership, 
that the Israeli leaders will maintain their procrastination and 
prevarication regarding the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho 
accord, and that it is in the interest of the Palestinians to 
coordinate with various Palestinian factions and forces to 
ensure harmony within the Palestinian camp, and also to enhance 
the relationship with Jordan and other Arab sides.

  [Text] Algerian Prime Minister Redha Malek has granted an 
interview to our colleagues of the French third television 
channel. He says he is in favor of a strong state, and one 
which at the same time is closer to the concerns of Algerians. 
Redha Malek : 
  [Begin recording] [Malek] Our intention and, I would even 
say, our wish and our determination, is to build a solid state 
on firm foundations, a state which is also credible, one which 
is in touch with the people and not cut off from the people, one 
which is with the people, which forms one body with the Algerian 
people. 
  [Correspondent Christian Mallard] So, it is a matter of 
putting behind you certain errors which may have been made in 
the past -- I am thinking in particular of the time of President 
Chedli Bendjedid? 
  [Malek] Yes, absolutely. We are in favor of making a break 
with it. If we have ended up in the current situation it is 
because the state did not play its role, because the consensus 
which had existed was eroded away, because there were deviations 
of all kinds, which meant that the state lost the trust of the 
people. The past is over, we are making a break with it, and we 
are moving on toward the future, and we are going toward the 
21st century with our heads high. [end recording]

  [Text] As we said in the headlines of this bulletin, the 
situation in Algeria was discussed by Prime Minister Redha Malek 
in an interview with the French media. He talked about 
politics, the economy, and prospects for political dialogue. 
Here is a summary of the main topics from Malek Elilmi. 
  [Malek] At a request from the National Dialogue Commission, 
Mr. Redha Malek said the Higher State Council [HCE] is 
continuing its task for another month to give greater 
opportunities for the dialogue to continue and for a national 
conference to be held. Mr. Redha Malek said the HCE has 
completed its task and had prevented Algeria from becoming a new 
Afghanistan. He said history will bear witness that in this 
difficult situation we have saved the state and democracy. 
  Redha Malek said the aim of the national conference is to 
arrive at the minimum level of consensus among Algerians who 
understand the democratic game and those who favor the rule of 
law and political pluralism. He said the dialogue is open to 
all reasonable Algerians who oppose terrorism and realize it is 
an impasse. We favor breaking with the mistakes of the past, 
Redha Malek said. We have gotten into this situation because 
the state did not play its role and the consensus which existed 
was broken up and eroded. Deviations occurred, Redha Malek said, 
which caused the people to lose confidence in the state. 
  The political authorities will now endeavor with full 
determination to build a firm state which has credibility among 
the people, Redha Malek added. 
  On Algeria's debts and economic revival, Redha Malek said 
Algeria will meet all the deadlines and will pay all its current 
debts of $25-26 billion. Debt servicing has become a heavy 
burden this year, reaching 9.3 billion. Since December, we have 
opened up a dialogue with the IMF. A meeting with our experts 
resulted in notable progress, and in January we will try to 
reach an agreement to ease debt servicing. 
  This stage is difficult, Redha Malek said, but it is 
temporary. We have great human and material resources, and we 
will endeavor to convince the international community to 
participate in reviving the Algerian economy.

  [Text] Cairo, 2 Jan (MENA)--Newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH notes 
that Israeli Prime Minister Rabin's remarks regarding the draft 
compromise document, which was submitted during the 
Israeli-Palestinian talks in Cairo, and the need to accept this 
draft represents a new setback for the peace efforts. The paper 
says that the remarks are also bound to torpedo the principle of 
dialogue and negotiations that has been pursued by the parties 
to the conflict as a way to resolve an issue that has been going 
on for years. 
  In its editorial today, AL-JUMHURIYAH states the belief that 
these remarks demonstrate that the Israeli tactics in 
negotiating and in dealing with the issues at hand will 
negatively affect the other tracks. 
  The paper goes on to say that the fact that Rabin's 
statements were made following the laying of the cornerstones of 
20 new West Bank settlements raises questions about Israel's 
intentions and Rabin's credibility. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH maintains that the policy of playing for time 
cannot wipe out the rights of the wronged nations that are 
struggling to wrest back their legitimate rights. The paper 
concludes its editorial by saying that this policy is a time 
bomb that will open wide the door of violence.

  [Text] AL-'ARABI has learned that the Israelis have 
initiated contacts with oil companies operating in Egypt that 
have discovered huge gas reserves. The Israeli ambassador in 
Cairo, accompanied by a small delegation, visited Shell-Egypt 
with the objective of starting practical steps in an Israeli 
project to export Egyptian gas through a pipeline to Israel. 
  Shell announced that it had discovered the largest gas 
reserves in the western desert, in the region of al-Abyad. The 
reserves are estimated at 14 billion cubic feet. Despite the 
fact that Oil Minister Hamdi al-Banbi announced that Egypt's 
position on exporting gas is still under consideration, public 
oil companies in Egypt do not generally adhere to the official 
position and own shares in gas companies, in accordance with the 
oil agreements, in exchange for investments in prospecting and 
digging. It is likely that practical steps will be agreed upon 
between Shell-Egypt and Israel, particularly because Shell is 
decreasing its prospecting activities to save funds for the 
investments that will be required to develop gas discoveries. 
  On the other hand, practical steps have already been taken 
to 
set up a refinery with the Israeli company Paz Adil, which is a 
subsidiary of the Merhav investment group. This is being done 
using two Egyptian businessmen as a cover. One of these men is 
a prominent member of the National Democratic Party in 
Alexandria. The other is reported to be an arms dealer. 
  An Israeli technical delegation will be arriving in Cairo 
tomorrow to meet with a number of officials from Egyptian 
companies after 1 January 1994. It is worth noting that the 
head of the investment authority earlier denied that Israelis 
were participating in a refinery and that the responsible 
company is registered abroad to dodge the Arab boycott 
officially enforced against Israel.

  [Text] Cairo, Dec 31 (AFP) -- Libyan opposition spokesmen 
in Cairo urged President Husni Mubarak Friday to intervene "more 
openly" to determine the fate of Mansur al-Kikhya, a prominent 
dissident who disappeared in the Egyptian capital earlier this 
month. 
  "According to our information, President Mubarak, who is 
displeased with the disappearance of Mr. al-Kikhya, has given 
his orders to competent authorities to do all that is possible 
in order to clarify this matter," said Muhammad Jibril, who 
represents the National Front for the Salvation of Libya in 
Cairo. 
  He said the Front had urged Mubarak to "adopt a firm stand" 
against the party responsible for the abduction of al-Kikhya, 
leader of the National Rally which is opposed to Libya's leader 
Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi. 
  Jibril said the "silence" which had prevailed over the past 
week over al-Kikhya's case only encouraged al-Qadhdhafi to 
commit other similar acts against members of the opposition. 
  The opposition had accused Libyan agents of kidnapping 
al-Kikhya who vanished on December 11 after leaving his hotel in 
Cairo where he was attending an Arab human rights conference. 
Libya denied last week any involvement in the affair, saying 
al-Kikhya was the victim of a feud between opposition groups. 
  "This silence gives way to other regimes to kidnap or 
liquidate dissidents living in Egypt," Jibril added. 
  The Egyptian president's political advisor, 'Usamah al-Baz, 
found no cooperation from Libyan officials during a visit to 
Tripoli on December 19 aimed at tracing the 63-year-old 
al-Kikhya, who was foreign minister under al-Qadhdhafi in the 
1970s and represented Libya at the United Nations between 1976 
and 1980.

<F P=106> [Report by Mahmud Bakri] </F>
  [Text] Well-informed sources have told AL-SHA'B that the 
Israeli intelligence service (Mosad) is probably behind the 
abduction of Libyan oppositionist Mansur al-Kikhya. The sources 
say that it is part of a scheme to undermine Egyptian-Libyan 
relations by blaming the operation on Libya and paving the way 
for a military strike against the Libyan Jamahiriyah. 
  The circles noted that an eight-member team from the U.S. 
intelligence service (CIA) will arrive in Cairo within a few 
days to investigate the disappearance of al-Kikhya. This is 
part of the U.S. Administration's plan to highlight the issue to 
adopt a military plan to strike at Colonel Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi's regime under the pretext of his violations of 
human rights. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton had instructed the U.S. 
intelligence service to adopt a speedy plan to identify the 
location of al-Kikhya and investigate claims that Libyan 
elements kidnapped him in collaboration with Egyptian security 
elements. He asked President Mubarak to intervene to clear up 
the mystery of al-Kikhya's disappearance. The visit to Libya of 
Dr. Usamah al-Baz, first Foreign Ministry under secretary and 
director of the President's Office for Political Affairs, came 
within this context. 
  In the past few days Cairo has received several U.S. reports 
accusing Libya of being involved in al-Kikhya's disappearance. 
The U.S. reports accused Libyan diplomats in Cairo of planning 
the operation and called on the Egyptian Government to downgrade 
its relations with Libya as a quick reaction to the operation. 
However, Egypt told Washington that it would not adopt any 
measures against Libya before the accusation is confirmed.

  [Text] Cairo, 30 Dec (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan 
al-Alfi has revealed that the security forces thwarted many 
dangerous terrorist operations that were supposed to be 
implemented on New Year's Eve, including an attempt to 
assassinate about 12 political, media, information, and police 
figures. Some current ministers were among those targeted. 
  In an interview with the newspaper AL-AHRAM that will be 
published tomorrow, Friday, al-Alfi said the security forces 
seized some maps and sketches of the routes followed by the 
individuals the terrorists were told to assassinate and the 
methods of attack, which have been thwarted. 
  Hasan al-Alfi said that New Year's Eve was supposed to 
witness huge explosions near eight large economic centers. He 
explained that one of the masterminds who planned and arranged 
the implementation of these operations was the amir of 
al-Badari, who was killed in a confrontation with the police 
yesterday. 
  Commenting on the role of foreigners in planning and 
financing these terrorist operations in Egypt, the interior 
minister referred to four foreign and Arab countries, without 
identifying them by name. He said these countries remain silent 
about terrorist training courses given inside camps on their 
territories, help in collecting donations, and conduct 
clandestine and coded communications with the persons in charge 
of carrying out operations inside Egypt. 
  The interior minister asserted that no less than 10 of the 
most dangerous al-Jihad and Islamic Group leaders plan, 
organize, and give orders to implement the operations. Al-Alfi 
added that there are intensive contacts with those countries to 
settle this dangerous situation. He explained that the training 
courses last at least six months and that every member who is 
instructed to carry out an operation is financed with $5,000, 
rising to $15,000 for some operations which have been uncovered. 
  At the conclusion of his interview with AL-AHRAM, the 
interior minister affirmed that no indiscriminate arrests have 
been made. This is proved by the fact that the defendants who 
were tried recently had rulings handed down against them. They 
are all active in terrorist operations and their confessions are 
full.

  [Text] Cairo, 30 Dec (MENA)--A statement issued today by 
the Interior Ministry explained that the security forces this 
morning raided al-Badari Island in Asyut, which is controlled by 
the al-Hamami family. The commander of the military wing of one 
of the terrorist organizations is a member of this family. He 
was killed in today's raid, and 57 other terrorists who were 
active members of the organization surrendered. 
  The statement said some papers, possessions, and documents 
about specific plans to target public figures and installations 
were seized, in addition to large amounts of weapons. 
  The statement added that one citizen was injured in this 
operation and a soldier from the Central Security Forces was 
killed. 
  The statement affirmed that this confrontation was part of 
the Interior Ministry's security policy to expand the efforts to 
confront various terrorist elements. 
  The following is the text of the Interior Ministry's 
statement about this operation: 
  As part of the security policy formulated by the Interior 
Ministry to expand the scope of the confrontation against all 
terrorist elements, which was initiated by the ministry to 
strike at the hotbeds and centers of public activities for these 
elements in the Governorates of Aswan, Qina, al-Fayyum, and 
Asyut--the most recent of which was to strike against the 
terrorist groups that were using the mosques of al-Rahmah and 
Miftah al-Rahman in Asyut as dens to hide their weapons and 
tracts, the State Security Investigations prepared themselves 
for a large-scale campaign on al-Badari Island. The island is 
controlled by the al-Hamami family, which has a strong grip on 
this region. The commander of the military wing of the 
terrorist organization in Upper Egypt is terrorist Salah 
Muhammad 'Atiyah al-Hamami. 
  In view of the large area of the island--about 4,500 
feddans--and its rough topography, in addition to it being 
surrounded by the Nile, a full and comprehensive plan was 
prepared after two months of monitoring and scouting the island 
to determine all roads leading to and from it. 
  Forces of the highest level of combat training prepared for 
the raid. They were joined by international antiterrorism 
forces and armored and amphibious central security forces. 
These groups planned to stormed the island and arrest all the 
individuals hiding there and using it as a headquarters to 
mastermind their operations. 
  The forces were aided by units from the Asyut Security 
Department, the Criminal Investigations Department, and various 
investigations groups because of the amount of information they 
have about this island. 
  At 0330 Wednesday, the forces stormed the island in extreme 
secrecy and conducted a thorough search. The forces entered the 
island according to plan and tightened their control over all 
the island's inlets and outlets. 
  The operation resulted in the death of the terrorist group's 
leader and commander of its military wing, Salah Muhammad 
'Atiyah al-Hamami, who was wanted in many terrorist cases, 
including Case 542/1993 of Markaz Sidfa. This case involves the 
assassination of Lieutenant Colonel Mahran 'Abd-al-Rahim, head 
of the State Security branch in (?Dayrut), and his son Muhammad. 
  This terrorist was regarded as the leader of the 
organization's military wing. He supervised the training, 
planning, and financing of the group's recent terrorist 
operations in Asyut, Qina, and Aswan Governorates. 
  An automatic rifle and a large quantity of ammunition were 
found in his possession. 
  Afterward, 57 active members of the terrorist organization 
surrendered to the raiding force. It turned out that some of 
them had carried out these operations, some had been in charge 
of training, and others were responsible for provisions, 
financial support, and conveying orders. All of them (?were) 
arrested. 
  The forces also seized papers, (?letters), and documents 
referring to operations that were being planned, including 
operations against some public figures and installations. The 
forces also seized other documents containing addresses of some 
of the organization's fugitive members in various governorates 
and providing important clues that will help the authorities 
arrest other fugitive terrorists. 
  Citizen Mustafa Kamil Ahmad 'Uthman was wounded in the 
clashes. He was hospitalized, and his current condition is 
positive. A Central Security Forces conscript, Rikabi Nur 'Ali, 
was killed. 
  The Prosecution Office was asked to initiate an 
investigation 
and take legal measures (?against) the arrested suspects. The 
forces are still combing the island. Their search is expected 
to take some time because of the rough topography of this island. 
  Plans are also being made for similar campaigns in all 
regions of the Republic's governorates that terrorists are 
reportedly using as hideouts. 
  The Interior Ministry affirms that, in the next stage, it 
will direct its blows forcefully and decisively against these 
sites to eliminate this renegade faction.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Cairo AL-AHRAM in Arabic on 28 December 
publishes on page 9 an approximately 2,000-word article by 
Islamist writer Fahmi Huwaydi under the headline "From Mediation 
to Dialogue." Seeing a need "to stop the civil clash and 
achieve some reconciliation to lay the foundations of internal 
peace and stability," the writer calls for dialogue among all 
the political forces in Egypt, including the Islamists. "The 
various challenges cannot seriously be confronted except through 
the effective participation of all the political and 
intellectual forces and trends," he maintains. 
  Huwaydi calls for learning from the lesson of Algeria, 
which, 
"after two years of reluctance when the country paid dearly," 
concluded that it was futile to try to ignore the Islamic trend. 
He also notes contacts between the British Government and the 
Irish Republican Army, quoting British Prime Minister John Major 
as saying: "A responsible government can waste no chance for 
peace, no matter how remote." 
  The writer criticizes the position of "some secular elite 
groups" in Egypt for "putting all Islamists in one basket and 
branding them with extremism and terrorism on the pretext that 
one group actually practices terrorism and the other--the 
moderate group--`hides' this evil intention." He says this 
characterization is not lacking in falsehood, fabrication, and 
slander. 
  In his call for dialogue, the writer draws attention to 
three 
points: 
  The Islamic trend and all political forces "denied 
legitimacy" must be invited to the national dialogue. "All 
political forces, irrespective of their trends, are partners in 
the homeland and therefore have a right to contribute to its 
present and future." 
  He states: "The Islamic trend is emphasized here for many 
reasons, notably that it is the most powerful among the forces 
denied legitimacy. It is also the party targeted by most of the 
slander designed to exclude it from the dialogue. 
Participation in the dialogue gives that dialogue credibility 
and seriousness and may help it succeed eventually." The writer 
adds: "I do not hide my intellectual affiliation with that 
trend, affiliation with the project and the position, not beyond 
that." 
  He goes on: "When I discuss the Islamic trend, I do not mean 
a specific group, as some of those who like to offer 
interpretations and fish in muddy waters may think. I am 
concerned about the principle." 
  Finally, on the subjects of such a dialogue, the writer 
proposes: "First, democracy, second, democracy, and third, 
democracy."

  [Text] During a session that lasted until the early hours 
of this morning, the People's Assembly passed the Unified Tax 
Bill in its final reading. Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi said 
the law, as issued, is well-balanced considering the amendments 
that have been made to it. He explained that the government was 
responsive to all the views offered by the deputies. He added 
that a high-level committee chaired by the justice minister will 
amend all relevant legislation to bring it into line with 
current circumstances. 
  People's Assembly Speaker Dr. Ahmad Fathi Surur asserted 
that 
the new law, which was discussed at length, contains no 
contradictions of Islamic shari'ah. 
  After passing the new bill, the People's Assembly adjourned 
until 8 January 1994. The Assembly approved articles 85, 87, 
and 88 pertaining to tax exemptions for families. It also 
approved Article 90, which specifies the tax rates as follows: 
  Section 1: 20 percent on income of up to 2,000 pounds. 
  Section 2: 27 percent on income greater than 2,500 pounds 
and up to 7,000 pounds. 
  Section 3: 35 percent on income greater than 7,000 pounds 
and up to 16,000 pounds. 
  Section 4: 40 percent on income greater than 16,000 
pounds and up to 27,000 pounds. 
  Section 5: 45 percent on income greater than 27,000 
pounds and up to 68,000 pounds. 
  Section 6: 48 percent on income greater than 68,000 
pounds. 
  Regarding income from salaries and similar and other revenue 
[as heard], the tax rate on them will be the same as that in 
section 1 -- 20 percent.

<F P=106> [Address by leader of the revolution Colonel Mu'ammar </F>
al-Qadhdhafi in Surman and Bu 'Isa on 2 January -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Brothers and sons of Surman, the world hears the 
strong voice of defiance from you. The voice of defiance is not 
only the voice of Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, but it is the voice of 
the masses, the free masses. Here in Surman, the same as 
yesterday and the other days in other regions, everywhere there 
are people ready for confrontation; people who insist on living 
on the land of their fathers and ancestors freely, 
independently, and with pride. [passage omitted] 
  Let the world hear the voice of the masses of Bu 'Isa and 
Surman. Let the world hear the voice of the free masses, however 
much those around us surrender and whatever the shivers of the 
rulers of the Arab nation might be. They want the Arab nation 
to be subjugated to its enemies. Whatever those who surrender 
might do, whatever those who prostrate themselves might do, and 
whatever those who tremble might do, we have decided to live 
freely and with dignity on the land of our fathers and 
ancestors. [passage omitted] 
  For this reason, to live in freedom and live a life worthy 
of 
the free man, for this reason we have decided that we will 
confront anyone who wants to challenge us over the land of our 
fathers and forefathers. This is our land, the land of the 
fathers and forefathers. We paid for this land with the lives 
of our fathers and forefathers. We have written its history in 
their dear blood. We will not squander one grain of sand of this 
land. The banners of this land will never fly under the banners 
of the colonialists. No foreigner or colonialist can settle 
this land. We challenge anyone who wants to challenge us. 
[passage omitted] 
  The defiance started in Libya; the cry of confrontation 
started in Libya; and the preparations for battle started in 
Libya. 
  Brothers, we hear now another voice from Sudan. Sudan 
announced yesterday the expulsion of the British ambassador 
because he considered Sudan a British colony. 
  The dreams of the colonialists have returned again. The 
dreams of the West have returned again. Their ambitions in 
Tunisia, Algeria, Sudan, Libya, and everywhere in the Arab world 
have returned. Their ambitions have returned again. 
  Yesterday Britain acted as if Sudan was not celebrating the 
38th anniversary of its independence. Britain ignored Sudan as 
an independent state. Britain ignored Sudan's dignity and 
Sudan's independence. Britain proceeded along the course of 
marching on the Arab homeland, trampling on the dignity of the 
Arab homeland, and Arab existence with an indifference to the 
national sovereignty of the peoples of the Arab nation. 
  Its ambassador quite insolently interfered in Khartoum's 
domestic affairs. Brothers, look at this. It is not the year 
1881 or 1882 or 1830, and it is not even 1911 [the date of the 
Italian invasion of Libya]. Today it is 1993-94. Britain 
behaved as if Sudan was a colony that belonged to King Faruq and 
Faruq belonged to Britain. This is how Britain sees Egypt's and 
Sudan's independence. 
  Yesterday, however, the Sudanese people headed by al-Bashir 
announced that the confrontation was not only in Libya, it has 
extended to Sudan by the expulsion of the British ambassador. 
Sudan said to him that Sudan is an independent state and only 
death can separate it. 
  This is what happened yesterday. The colonialists recognized 
the legitimacy of the Somali national resistance. They 
recognized Aidid as its national leader and that they must 
negotiate with him after they used to say that he was a war 
criminal who must be captured. 
  Brothers, this is a retreat in the face of the determination 
of the Somali people to uphold truth and defeat lies. The truth 
is that every nation has the right to live on the land of its 
fathers and forefathers in freedom and dignity. Brothers, all 
the peoples possess the right to die in defense of their honor 
and independence. 
  The colonialists will pull back when they face these [words 
indistinct] these challenges and this determination; the 
determination of peoples to live freely brothers. Yes, they 
will have to be very wary. This is coming from the masses of 
Surman and Bu 'Isa only, not to mention the masses of the Arab 
nation and the masses of Libya as a whole. There are masses in 
Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Iraq, 
the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen, and Sudan [repeated as heard]. 
There are innumerable masses and the colonialists will find it 
difficult to impose their dominion again on a nation that is 
beating the drums of confrontation, a nation that has decided to 
live freely. 
  Yes, brothers, we are not just talking, we are demonstrating 
with deeds. The national resistance in southern Lebanon is 
daily writing in blood the words that we are speaking now, and 
it is paving the path of liberation with the bodies of the 
martyrs of Hizballah and the Lebanese national resistance. 
There is fighting every day [word indistinct] in southern 
Lebanon and Palestine under the leadership of Palestinian Jihad, 
the Fatah Eagles, Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], the 
Popular Front, the Popular Democratic Front, the Popular 
Front-General Command, the Fatah of Intifadah, and 
Fatah-Revolutionary Council. [passage omitted] 
  Brothers, those who sell Palestine now in a public auction 
will be punished by the Palestinian people. Brothers, those who 
betray the Arab nation will see their just fate. 
  Brothers, we did not decide to go outside our borders. We 
did not decide to commit aggression. We did not decide to 
sabotage the world. We did not decide to trample on 
international legitimacy. We only decided to live with respect 
and dignity on our land. This is what we demanded and we will 
defend it until death. They are the ones who trampled on the 
international treaties and tore the UN Charter. They are the 
ones who violated international law. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report from Tripoli by Ahmad al-Siyufi] </F>
  [Text] Libyan Foreign Minister [title as published] 'Umar 
al-Muntasir has emphasized that Libya has nothing to do, 
directly or indirectly, with the abduction of Libyan 
oppositionist Mansur al-Kikhya. He added: We are certain that 
the Egyptian authorities will discover the facts and identify 
those behind this crime. According to al-Muntasir, the purpose 
of this crime is to drive a wedge between Egypt and Libya and 
spoil the relations between the two countries, particularly 
since several parties have an interest in clouding the 
atmosphere. 
  Al-Muntasir's remarks came in response to a question by 
AL-SHA'B concerning the mystery surrounding al-Kikhya's 
disappearance during a news conference held at the Libyan 
Foreign Ministry yesterday. 
  In an exclusive statement to AL-SHA'B, Egyptian ambassador 
to 
Libya Lieutenant General Mustafa al-Shadhili has noted that he 
completely rules out Libya's involvement in this issue. He 
added that he is almost certain that Libya has nothing to do 
with this issue, as the investigations will show. 
  Libyan sources have stressed that Libya is not connected to 
the incident for the following reasons: 
  1. Al-Kikhya is practicing politics and does not carry arms. 
Were the principle of abduction to be used, which is rejected, 
it would be more worthwhile to use it against those who carry 
and train with arms. 
  2. Al-Kikhya's position on the Lockerbie case was in line 
with the Libyan stance. Al-Kikhya denied Libya's responsibility 
for blowing up the U.S. aircraft. 
  3. Various attempts are being made by some Western states to 
spoil Egyptian-Libyan relations. 
  4. The incident comes at a time when the Western charges 
against Libya in connection with the Lockerbie issue have 
started to collapse. Thus, something new had to be found to 
strike at Libya.

western states against the Great Jamahiriya. 
  A statement was issued to express rejection, defiance and 
the 
readiness to defend the Great al-Fatah revolution and the Arab 
nation against the lurking attacks of the vicious neo-crusaders.

  [Text] Kuwait, 2 Jan (KUNA) -- The state security court 
here today sentenced a person accused of belonging to the 
so-called Iraqi People's Army to 10 years hard labor and 
deportation upon completion of the sentence. The same court 
acquitted Hani Marzuq, a 36 year-old stateless man, who was 
charged with collaborating with the troops of the Iraqi regime 
during their occupation of Kuwait. 
  The court, which held its session today under the 
chairmanship of Counsellor Salah al-Fahd, had first sentenced 
Jabir Sughayir Farhan, a 34-year-old stateless man, to 10 years 
hard labor. The defendant had claimed that he had been forced 
to join the so-called Iraqi People's Army, alleging that he had 
been threatened with execution if he refused to do so. 
  The same court has postponed the case of defendant Khalid 
Sahir al-Khaldi, a 42-year-old Kuwaiti national, who is accused 
of joining the so-called Iraqi People's Army during Kuwait's 
occupation by the Iraqi regime, until 12 February 1994 when it 
will listen to the speech for the defense. 
  The aforementioned defendant has claimed that he was taking 
out identity cards for members of his tribe, from the province 
of al-Jahran, to enable them to travel in Kuwait during the 
occupation of the latter by the troops of the Iraqi regime. He 
added: "I did not knock on anyone's door; it was they who came 
to my house asking for my protection out of fear of the Iraqi 
People's Army and anyone who says otherwise is ungrateful." 
  The same court has also postponed the case of defendant 
Mufidah Salih al-Haj 'Amr, a Jordanian woman who is on the run 
and who is accused of passing information to the enemy.

statements published here today denied the existence of any 
foreign pressure on Kuwait to halt the carrying out of sentences 
passed by the judiciary on those who are convicted. He said in 
an interview with AL-QABAS that if it happened it would be an 
infringement on the state's independence and sovereignty and an 
interference in its internal affairs, and this we reject. He 
added: Nevertheless, we at the ministry or at the public 
prosecution service do not deny that we have received many 
cables -- whose originators are unknown -- requesting the 
reduction of sentences passed on some of the convicted. In 
reply to a question on whether the death sentences that were 
passed by the state security court would be commuted, the 
minister said: It is known that the final judicial verdicts 
should be carried out, and these may be in the form of prison 
sentences, death sentences, or acquittals. No death sentence 
will be carried out until it is ratified by the amir. Those 
sentenced to death are placed in jail until the amir issues his 
decision to ratify the sentence, commute it, or issue a pardon.

  [Text] Kuwait, 1 Jan (MENA)--Kuwaiti Information Minister 
Shaykh Sa'ud Nasir al-Sabah has declared that his country is 
willing to attend an Arab summit if there is a strong general 
wish to hold such a meeting, particularly as Kuwait has always 
called for unifying Arab ranks and ending Arab disagreements. 
  In an exclusive statement to MENA, the Kuwaiti information 
minister added that the countries that broke ranks, departed 
from pan-Arab unanimity, and backed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait 
must first reconsider their position and recognize the relevant 
UN Security Council resolutions, particularly those dealing with 
border demarcation and the liberation of Kuwait. He said that 
this demand is not negotiable and that the countries that backed 
Iraq must take the first step on this matter. 
  He pointed out that Kuwait regards its borders, its 
existence, and its POW's as nonnegotiable, fundamental, and 
fateful issues. 
  Shaykh Sa'ud Nasir al-Sabah regretted the current lack of 
inter-Arab solidarity and hoped that the Arab countries will 
succeed in surmounting this ordeal so that matters can return to 
normal and those in error can rectify their stances. 
  It should be noted that Kuwait refers to the countries that 
supported the Iraqi invasion as the adversary countries. They 
include Jordan, the PLO, Yemen, Sudan, Mauritania, and Algeria.

  [Text] Kuwait 2 Jan, (KUNA) -- A responsible source at the 
Interior Ministry said that the ministry would not allow 
nationals of the adversary states to enter Kuwait, even in the 
event of the restoration of diplomatic relations between Kuwait 
and those states. 
  In a statement to the newspaper AL-RAY AL-'AM published 
today, the source says that the cause for this is the position 
of these states and their nationals during the period of the 
savage invasion and the occupation of Kuwait by the Iraqi 
regime, positions that prolonged its occupation of Kuwait. The 
source has also stressed that the Interior Ministry recently 
discovered that some nationals of the adversary states had 
entered the country with false passports and nationalities, and 
they are now being investigated. 
  He said that the ministry was still engaged in large-scale 
search operations to arrest those who contravened the residence 
law. The ministry, in cooperation with the Ministry of Social 
Affairs, has also referred to the public prosecutor's office a 
number of foreign nationals for contravening employment laws and 
regulations. He also said that in the new year, the country 
would witness greater and more stable security now that the 
ministry has laid down several plans that will be implemented in 
stages, among which is restricting the number of immigrants, the 
confiscation of weapons still in the hands of some people, and 
severity in the carrying out of the laws pertaining to the 
country's security and safety.

  [Excerpt] Sanaa, Amman, AL-ITTIHAD, and news agencies-- 
Jordanian mediation has managed to set a date for a meeting 
between Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 
'Ali Salim al-Bid to defuse the political crisis in Yemen. 
AL-ITTIHAD has learned that the meeting will be held in Amman 
next week. This will be the first sign of a relaxation since 
the eruption of the crisis four months ago. 
  Responsible Jordanian sources informed AL-ITTIHAD yesterday 
evening that Mujahid Abu-Shawarib, envoy of the Yemeni 
president, who has arrived in Amman on a visit, informed 
Jordanian officials led by the Jordanian monarch, King Husayn, 
that Salih and al-Bid have agreed to meet in Amman. The 
JORDANIAN NEWS AGENCY has reported that King Husayn expressed 
satisfaction over progress in the efforts to end the crisis 
after the meeting he had held with the Yemeni envoy. The agency 
added that the king also expressed his wish to continue to aid 
fraternal Yemenis to enable them to surmount this transient 
crisis in order to safeguard the special accomplishments of 
fraternal Yemen as well as its great pan-Arab role, given that 
the success of Yemeni unity will nurture the nation's hopes of 
achieving unity and democracy. 
  Sanaa Television has also noted al-Bid's agreement to meet 
with Salih. The television noted that al-Bid informed a 
delegation of clergymen who are mediating the crisis between him 
and Salih that he is ready to meet with the Yemeni president 
once efforts to implement the 18 points the Yemeni Socialist 
Party has proposed are started. 
  For his part, Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim 
Basindwah has expressed optimism over the prospects of ending 
the political crisis in Yemen. He added that the political 
dialogue currently under way in Yemen has expunged the 
likelihood of resorting to violence, and confirmed that unity is 
there to stay. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Informed political sources have revealed the secrets 
of the recent visit to Yemen by [Jordanian Royal Court Chief] 
al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir. The visit, according to these 
sources, was more than just a mediation mission to resolve the 
Yemeni crisis which has reached a difficult stage. 
  The sources, who met Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
last week, told AKHIR KHABAR that the Yemeni leadership asked 
al-Sharif Zayd to help it reorganize the Yemeni Armed Forces 
which appear to be gradually affected by the ongoing tribal and 
party conflict in Yemen. 
  Al-Sharif Zayd will supervise the drafting of a plan to 
reorganize the Yemeni Armed Forces which are facing technical 
problems in terms of organization, training, general 
mobilization, and combat capabilities. 
  Our sources added that al-Sharif Zayd was accompanied by a 
number of specialists who reviewed the plan with the Yemeni 
leadership. The sources added that the Yemeni president 
officially asked the Jordanian leadership to prepare such a 
plan. The Jordanian leadership held contacts with all parties 
to find common grounds that would defuse the crisis before it 
explodes. 
  Last week, the two parties to the Yemeni dispute agreed to 
neutralize the Armed Forces and to avoid the provocations that 
would involve them in the conflict. 
  Yemeni diplomatic sources in Amman told AKHIR KHABAR that 
the 
Yemeni leadership explained to mediators that it wants to remove 
the roots of division which threaten the Yemeni Army ranks 
following the emergence of signs of division. The sources 
added: The Yemeni leadership is unanimous on the need to carry 
out a comprehensive national military orientation plan and to 
busy the Armed Forces with military training to keep them away 
from tension points that would affect them as a result of the 
tribal conflict. 
  The sources linked the recent Jordanian-Yemeni contacts with 
the new trends produced by military incidents and tension. The 
sources said: The Jordanian assistance in this regard will come 
within the framework of the vital and important role played by 
the Jordanian leadership which enjoys the confidence of all 
parties in the conflict.

  [Text] Kabul remains the scene of intense battles between 
the warring factions for a third day. Thousands of artillery 
shells, bullets, and rockets have hit various districts of 
Kabul, leaving hundreds dead. Here is our colleague with a 
telephone report from Kabul on the situation: 
  [Unidentified correspondent] I am reporting from Kabul. The 
battle between the warring factions intensified this morning. 
As a result of artillery fire, Kabul radio's transmitter is out 
of action. 
  Forces of Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami 
[Islamic Party of Afghanistan] have joined General Dostam's 
forces, and forces loyal to Hezb-e Ettehad-e Eslami [Islamic 
Union of Afghanistan] of Rasul Sayyaf have joined those of 
President Borhanoddin Rabbani, and have turned Kabul into a 
battle arena since dawn this morning. 
  Another report from Kabul's hospitals indicate that 650 
wounded people, mostly civilians, are hospitalized in two city 
hospitals. Reports from the southeastern district of Kabul, the 
main area of concentration of General Dostam's forces, indicate 
that the intensity of the clashes prevents the people from 
evacuating their dead and wounded from houses. Columns of thick 
smoke cover the sky above Kabul and in the city itself nothing 
but the fire of artillery exchanges is visible.

  [Text] Muhammad al-Amin Khalifah, the speaker of the 
Transitional National Assembly, has told our radio correspondent 
that the Sudanese Government will not withdraw from the decision 
it has issued about the British ambassador's departure from the 
country within a period not exceeding two weeks. He added: We 
have asked for the British ambassador's departure in an attempt 
to improve relations between the two countries. It is for 
Britain to nominate another person from its embassy to be acting 
ambassador. He stressed that the matter was legitimate and does 
occur in diplomatic relations. He pointed out that the British 
Government's demand that the Sudanese Government should 
reconsider its decision is a matter which is not legitimate in 
these relations. 
  He also made reference to the visit of the Archbishop of 
Canterbury to Sudan. He said that he considered the archbishop 
as a VIP and he ought to have entered Sudan through the capital, 
Khartoum, but regrettably he went to see the rebels and visited 
the citizens who were under the control of the rebels.

  [Excerpts] The president of the Republic, Lieutenant 
General 'Umar Hasan Ahmad al-Bashir, has confirmed that the 
expulsion of the British ambassador in Khartoum was in response 
to his interference in the internal affairs of the country at a 
time when the Sudanese people were celebrating the passing of 38 
years since Sudan received its independence and since the 
expulsion of the British colonialists. Within this framework, 
ladies and gentlemen, revolves the radio commentary on the news, 
written and read by our colleague Abd al-Amin Awad. 
  [Begin Al-Amin Awad recording] Through the treatment and 
[word indistinct] in the British media of the question of the 
expulsion by the Sudanese authorities of the British ambassador 
in Khartoum, and the reactions which followed here and there, it 
will appear to any observer of this intensive media interest 
that the British Government aims at transforming Sudan's request 
into a diplomatic crisis and perhaps to sever relations 
[qati'ah] with Sudan. This is a baffling matter for many 
reasons, including the fact that when Sudan presented its 
legitimate demand to the British Government it did not commit a 
prohibited act but was exercising its natural right, which it 
has earned by reason of its sovereignty and its affiliation to 
the civilized world as well as the treaties, regulations, and 
laws which regulate that affiliation accepted by members of the 
international community, including Britain. [passage omitted] 
  With an objective understanding of the expulsion decision, 
the British message to Sudan, which speaks about the need for 
Sudan to reconsider the expulsion of its ambassador in Khartoum, 
appears as a waste of time without any benefit. 
  Indeed the British Government reached the level of insolence 
and triviality when it fixed a 4-day period for receiving a 
reply from the Sudanese Government on the reconsideration of its 
decisions. This is a naked challenge revealing the extent of 
arrogance and vanity with which the empire wants to deal with 
its colonies over which the sun has already set. The British 
ambassador in Khartoum (?thinks himself) in the position of the 
British high commissioner of those far-off days. 
  It is incumbent upon the British Government to realize that 
the Sudanese decision was not a hasty decision and has no direct 
link to the visit of the archbishop of Canterbury to Sudan even 
though the matters relating to the visit were the last straw 
that broke the camel's back. Sudan has shown a great deal of 
patience concerning the reckless practices and [word indistinct] 
behavior of Mr. Peter Streams, the British ambassador, monitored 
by the security services. They were practices and behavior that 
Britain would not accept in terms of the level of its relations 
with Sudan, neither would Sudan accept them in its relations 
with the British Government and people. [passage omitted] 
  We look forward to the British Government's dealing with the 
Sudanese decision with (?wisdom) far from convulsive reaction to 
Sudan. It should think carefully before proceeding to take a 
silly step making things even worse by increasing its 
estrangement with Khartoum, particularly as relations were, in 
fact, lukewarm if not tense between the two countries. [end 
recording]

  [Text] London, Jan 3 (MAP) -- Sudan has accused the British 
ambassador to Khartoum, Peter Streams, of working against its 
efforts to mend fences with the West. But a "highly-placed 
political sources" hinted in a report in the government 
newspaper "AL-INGAZ AL-WATANI" that the expulsion order could be 
reversed if Britain showed understanding of the reasons behind 
the order. On Thursday Sudan said that it was giving Streams 
two weeks to leave. Britain has given Sudan until Tuesday to 
reverse the decision or face retaliation. The Sudanese 
official said that the expulsion had nothing to do with the 
ambassador's contacts with Sudanese opposition leaders or 
controversy over a visit to southern Sudan by George Carey, the 
archbishop of Canterbury.

  [Text] Khartoum, 2 Jan (SUNA) -- Dr. Husayn Sulayman 
Abu-Salih, minister of foreign affairs, reiterated that the 
Sudan respects the governments of other countries and did not 
interfere in the affairs of these states. Dr. Abu-Salih said 
the relations of Sudan and Eritrea were friendly and not 
affected and that meetings between the two countries would 
continue at all levels. 
  The foreign minister affirmed that the Sudan sincerely made 
efforts for stability of not only Eritrea but the whole area of 
the African horn because stability was a basic priority of the 
development process. Dr. Abu-Salih also said in a press 
statement that the Sudan did not allow any acts leading to 
undermining these strong and stable ties which would remain so 
between the two states. 
  Dr. Abu-Salih also said that any issue relating to the 
progress of the relations of the two states would be discussed 
and negotiated at all levels, adding that dialogue, exchange of 
opinions and consultation was the better way to settle any 
dispute which arised [as received] from time to time. 
  The foreign minister also denied any link between the 
Eritrean president's recent statement reported by the news 
agencies on hostile armed movements launched from the Sudan and 
the Sudan's decision to expel the British ambassador in 
Khartoum, indicating the Sudanese-Eritrean links were friendly 
and that the meetings between the two states were held at all 
means [as received]. 
  In response to the question on the archbishop of 
Canterbury's 
reported visit to the south of the Sudan he said that any state 
has sovereignty on its territories and did not allow entrance to 
its territories except through its legitimate doors and 
permission.

  [Text] Khartoum, 3 Jan (SUNA) -- Foreign Minister Husayn

in the refugee camps. His excellency added that all the refugee 
camps were under the full administrative control of the UNHCR. 
They are far away from the border and constitute no threat of 
any kind against neighboring countries. He stressed that the 
UNHCR's priority [words indistinct] monitors all activities by 
the refugees and does not allow any violation of the 
international conventions governing asylum. 
  It is worth mentioning that the number of Eritrean refugees 
in Sudan exceeds 500,000 living in 30 different places. 
Eritrean President Isayas Afewerki announced that his forces 
had killed more than 20 persons who tried to infiltrate into 
Eritrea from Sudan on 16 December. He described Sudan as the 
source of the problem. He accused the infiltrators as having 
come to liberate the area.

  [Text] Today's AL-INQADH AL-WATANI newspaper carries a 
report from Kampala saying that a group of 51 armed rebels from 
rebel Garang's faction attacked the camp housing Sudanese 
refugees at (Dango) in Zaire, with the aim of liquidating some 
elements. Four citizens in the camp were killed. Firing 
continued for over (?an hour). 
  The report states that the Zairian forces succeeded in 
capturing one of the rebels, after which the group of rebel 
Garang threatened to kill the official in charge of (Dango), the 
police officer, and the official in charge of the refugees, 
unless a detained rebel who had participated in the attack was 
handed over. 
  The Zairian authorities have condemned the aggression 
inflicted by the rebels on refugee camps and refused the rebel 
demand. In response to the rebel provocations, they have sent a 
large force of Zairian soldiers to secure the camp and the 
surrounding area. UNHCR headquarters in Geneva has been 
informed about the incident.

<F P=106> [Address by General 'Umar Al-Bashir, president of the </F>
Republic of Sudan, in Shandi, marking Sudan's 38th independence 
anniversary -- live] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate; praise be to God and peace and prayers be upon 
the best of the prophets, our lord Mohammed, and all his kith 
and kin. 
  My dear compatriots; my family and tribe in Shandi; peace 
and 
God's mercy and blessings be upon you. It is, brothers and 
sisters, a unique moment in which we meet on this blessed day -- 
the day of the anniversary of Sudan's independence -- with the 
masses of Shandi. [passage omitted] 
  The believer, brothers and sisters, does not seek refuge 
except in Almighty God. He does not kneel except to Almighty 
God. He does not ask anyone except Almighty God. Also, after 
gaining real independence, we do not seek refuge or kneel before 
anyone except Almighty God. 
  We ask nothing from anyone or from any state. It is because 
we only ask this from Almighty God. We are not asking anyone or 
any state for strength, because strength belongs to God the all 
powerful. [passage omitted] Our slogan is self-reliance; we 
should eat what we grow and wear what we make. [passage 
omitted] 
  On this day we salute our people's valiant and victorious 
forces currently deployed at the locations of operations, 
presenting one martyr after another and wounded after wounded in 
order to preserve our independence. Salutations to them while 
they are irrigating the land of the south with their blood so 
that the land may sprout dignity and honor. Salutations to them 
while they are protecting our independence, land, honor, and 
dignity. 
  Salutations on this day, brothers and sisters, to the 
unified 
police officers and men who in the past stood in support of the 
national movement, and who are now standing with their armed 
forces in defense of honor and land, and in protection of 
independence. Salutations on this day to our farmers who have 
liberated our decision and preserved our independence by the 
cereals they produce to protect the dignity and honor of the 
Sudan. Salutations to our farmers who have transformed our 
slogans -- that we should eat from what we farm -- into the 
reality we are living today. [passage omitted] 
  From this rostrum I give directions for setting up a 
national 
committee to review and write the history of the national 
movement so that our own generation and the coming generation 
will learn about the struggle of our forefathers, the leaders of 
the national movement, so that they can receive their 
appreciation. [passage omitted] 
  Brothers and sisters, our people had to make some stops 
during crucial moments of their unity stand which led to the 
independence of Sudan. But after independence some of our 
leaders became preoccupied with worldly matters. They fought 
one another and were busy gathering booty, distributing gains 
and struggling for power. They squandered our independence and 
they neglected our decision-making; they squandered our land to 
let the mutineers sieze it. They neglected our people so much so 
that they began to beg for charity and aid. But while the 
leaders of this country were being complacent, the revolution 
surged forward, either a revolution led by the army and 
supported by the Sudanese people, or a revolution led by the 
Sudanese people and supported by the armed forces. This has 
been the case until, brothers and sisters, the revolution of 
national salvation came to be, and it was led by the army. It 
was supported by all the members of the Sudanese nation, who 
stood behind it and who pushed it forward . The revolution of 
national salvation came to restore the real meaning of 
independence. It came in order to realise independence. 
  Then we began to call for self-reliance. The Sudanese people 
did not fail us. Almighty God did not fail us after we rejected 
all the threats of the West and its aides, after we rejected all 
the temptations of the forces of haughtiness and colonialism. 
We prayed to Almighty God, asking for reinforcement and help 
and relief. We all looked up to Him. He did not fail us. He 
provided us with ample relief and abundant production, as a 
result of which we managed to realise self-sufficiency, liberate 
our decision-making and realise our independence. [passage 
omitted] 
  We recalled Almighty God's words. We remembered His words 
and we said: For us, God is sufficent, and He is the best 
disposer of affairs. [Chants of "God is Great"] 
  We turned to your sons and brothers in the armed forces, 
provided them with equipment and military supplies and called 
for the formation of the People's Defense Forces. All that was 
in obedience to Almighty God's order to provide them with all 
possible power and supplies. Your sons and brothers took part 
in crossing operations [as heard]. These operations were a true 
crossing over from the state of defeat to victory, weakness to 
strength, degradation and defeat to dignity and pride. The 
sword of the crossing pounded the rebel battalions and was the 
cause of terror amongst the enemies of Almighty God. 
  The salvation revolution came to rebuild Sudan, to restore 
the glory and dignity of the Sudanese people, to put Sudan back 
into its normal place as leader and imam of the peoples of the 
world. [passage omitted] 
  We are looking to build Sudan, a Sudan with honor and pride. 
We must overcome all difficulties to achieve this noble aim 
because the road to gaining self-respect and pride is not easy 
but is full of hurdles, obstacles and thorns. But our honorable 
people can overcome all the difficulties, all the hurdles and 
all the obstacles. [chants of "God is Great," and "There is no 
God but one God"] [passage omitted] 
  We have also gone to the oilfields which the previous 
governments placed as a hostage in the hands of the American 
Chevron Company. The salvation revolution came to liberate 
Sudan's oil. Work has now begun in earnest to extract and 
refine Sudan's oil. 
  Brothers and sisters, in order to build Sudan, we must also 
build an infrastructure of roads in order to connect the 
different parts of the country and facilitate the movement of 
people and goods. The Defiance Highway, the artery of the 
north, the western Salvation Highway, the Peace Highway, the 
Salvation Highway from Madani to Manaqil, the Halfa-Sab'at 
highway, all these, brothers and sisters, are now being 
constructed with purely Sudanese efforts. 
  Life is also being returned to the railways, that vital 
artery, and work has been carried out to build airports in Port 
Sudan, Dunqula and Al-Fashir. There has also been work to adapt 
ports and build new ports, like the expansion of Port Sudan and 
the ports of Sawakin and Usayf. [passage omitted] 
  Brothers and sisters, on the anniversary of independence we 
should recall the lofty stances taken by the Sudanese people, in 
all its factions. The Sudanese people were united in the 
realization of self-autonomy and the signing of the 
self-autonomy agreement. We should salute the memory of our 
leaders on that date -- the end of 1955 -- 19 December; the day 
when the Sudanese people forgot all their tribal and party 
differences; when the word for the Sudanese people was united, 
when the decision on independence was declared from inside 
parliament. These are the stances which we should recall 
because all this achievement was realized thanks to the unity of 
the word and the rank. Had God willed that we should continue 
in that unity we would today be in a different position to our 
current one, and we would be in a different situation to our 
present situation. 
  But the leaders, following that great achievement, became 
disunited. Sudan's identity was lost. Sudan's interests were 
lost. We lagged behind, until the salvation revolution came to 
restore national unity and reunite the Sudanese rank, and to 
invite all -- after we had placed all our trust in Almighty God 
and after we raised the banner of "There is no God but God" -- 
to unite and close our rank to build the new Sudan. 
  Today I call on all the sons of Sudan to forget all our old 
differences, all our party, sect, tribal, and regional 
differences, so that we talk together and join together behind 
the banner: There is no God but God and Mohammad is the 
messenger of God. [passage omitted] [Chants of "God is great"] 
  Brothers and sisters, on this day we must not forget peace 
and the call for peace, and we must call on our brothers, whom 
time and the enemies of Sudan have exposed to danger, to let us 
talk together and to sit down with us to hold a dialogue for the 
sake of peace in order to restore the unity of Sudan and bring 
peace to all the Sudanese people. We want this day to be a day 
of peace, and this year to be the year of peace in which peace 
is attained, Almighty God permitting. We want peace for all the 
people of Sudan and we want peace for Sudan with all its 
neighbors and brothers. We do not interfere in anyone's affairs 
nor do we plot against anyone. We only declared our 
independence and our independent decision. We want to build our 
Sudan, relying on ourselves, Almighty God permitting. 
  We also call on all peoples of the world to work for peace 
and call for peace, to work for the good of humankind and to 
assure the future of their sons, to develop humankind and 
underdeveloped regions and those peoples who are bowed under the 
burden of backwardness, hunger and ignorance. 
  Greetings on this day to our brothers in brotherly Iraq. We 
praise their steadfastness and their stand against arrogance. 
We praise them and pray that they become victorious. We wish 
them consolidated victory, God willing. 
  Greetings to our brothers in the Libyan Jamahiriyah while 
they resist colonialism and the new sanctions imposed on them. 
We do not forget, on this day, to urge our brothers in 
brotherly Yemen to forget their disputes and to safeguard their 
trusteeship. 
  We must also remember on this day our brothers who are being 
exposed to mass liquidation -- our brothers in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  This is a living example of man's injustice toward his 
brother mankind. This living example is an example of human 
rights' violations in the heart of Europe, which accuses us of 
violating human rights. Our brothers in Bosnia-Herzegovina are 
undergoing ethnic cleansing, not for committing any mistake or 
crime other than saying: There is no God but one God, Mohammad 
is the Prophet of God. And they accuse us of persecuting people 
of other religions. 
  Also, greetings to our brothers in Somalia for their 
steadfastness and stand which forced the colonizing powers to 
leave Somalia. 
  Greetings to the people of Palestine and the sons of 
Palestine, to the revolution of rocks and the children of rocks 
who stood up against the Zionist enemy, made him bow, humiliated 
him and made him sit down for negotiations. 
  You have heard through the media that we have asked Britain, 
the colonizing state, to recall its ambassador in Khartoum 
because he interfered in and encroached on what did not concern 
him, and he forgot that today we are celebrating the 38th 
anniversary of the exit of his people, who were expelled and 
alienated, not to return, God willing. 
  Brothers and sisters, we wanted it to be a lesson for them 
and a lesson that we are independent and will not permit anyone 
to harm our independence. [passage omitted] 
  Brothers and sisters, my family and kinsfolk, I greet you 
and 
hope that we will continue to meet on the path of inimitable 
achievement. God is great, and all power to Sudan. Peace be 
upon you and the mercy and blessings of God.

  [Text] New Delhi regretted the rejection of its request by 
the Belgian Government for the extradition of the JKLF [Jammu 
Kashmir Liberation Front] leader, Amanullah Khan, to India. 
Talking to newspersons, the spokesman of the External Affairs 
Ministry said that the government of India had provided 
comprehensive details to the government of Belgium. The case 
was presented in the court by the public prosecutor of that 
country. The spokesman observed that the decision is not based 
on the facts of the case but on political and extremist 
consideration. 
  Replying to another question on the forthcoming 
Indo-Pakistan 
foreign secretary level talks, the spokesman said India has 
adopted a realistic approach and is going for the talks to 
Islamabad with a lot of hopes. He said the government of India 
has noted certain reports appearing in the Pakistani press and 
has preferred to ignore them.

  [Text] India and China will soon start talks on reducing 
troop levels on both sides of the Line of Actual Control. This 
is in pursuance of an agreement signed during the prime 
minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao's visit to Beijing during September 
last year. The Chinese ambassador, Mr. Cheng Ruisheng, said in 
New Delhi that an expert group of diplomats and military 
personnel set up as part of the agreement will hold its talks in 
the capital next month. He said both the countries want to 
divert their resources from military to economic development. 
He also said that a high-level delegation of the Communist 
Party of China will be on a week-long visit to India from 
seventh of this month at the invitation of the Congress-I. A 
festival of India will be held in China in May this year, he 
added.

<F P=106> [Commentary by A.K. Bhattacharya] </F>
  [Text] The latest review of the Indian economy suggests 
that the gross domestic product during the current financial 
year ending March 1994 will be between four and five percent. 
This may not be an achievement worth a celebration. But at the 
same time, it is not an easy task either to clock a four or five 
percent GDP growth in only the third year of the economic 
reforms. The experience of economic reforms all over the world 
has shown that there is a sharp decline in growth of GDP in the 
first few years after the introduction of structural adjustments 
and economic reforms policies. This is because the industry and 
other economic agents take their own time to get adjusted to the 
new rules of the game. As a result, GDP growth is the first 
casualty. The fiscal squeeze, which normally accompany such 
reforms and structural adjustment, has also been rather modest, 
some critics argue. This will mean that there has been 
virtually no fiscal squeeze in 1993-94. The hope now is that 
the finance minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, will present a budget 
for 1994-95 in February that seeks to reduce the fiscal deficit 
to a more manageable level and in consistence with the pursuit 
of economic reforms and structural adjustment policies of the 
government. 
  The government's optimism on the GDP growth can also be 
explained from the fact that the agricultural sector will once 
again do reasonably well during the current year, exceeding the 
production levels reached in 1992-93. Monsoons have been good 
this year and there has been no slippages in the timely supply 
of fertilizers. Even the procurement prices for major crops 
during both the commercial rabi [spring] and main kharif 
[autumn] seasons were announced well in time, ensuring that 
farmers go ahead with their plans for sowing in full knowledge 
of the likely returns the crops might fetch in the market. 
Since the weightage of agricultural production in the GDP is 
quite substantial, any increase in the farm output helps the 
economy record a reasonable growth rate even if industrial 
production lacks behind the targets. 
  Such optimism has now been further boosted by the fact that 
the industrial sector has at last begun to see some light at the 
end of the long tunnel called recession. The depression of 
demand witnessed in most consumer durable sectors in this 
country for the last two years seems to be over. A large number 
of industries, including those in the transportation sector like 
the automobiles manufactures, are reporting higher sales. The 
six-monthly performance of the most companies operating in the 
consumer durable sector have shown a marked improvement in the 
sales. Excise duty collections, which is one of the key 
indicators of the degree of manufacturing activity in industry, 
has also begun picking up. 
  If all this gets reflected in GDP as they should, there is 
no 
reason to doubt the government's projection that the GDP growth 
this year would cross four percent. There is, however, a need 
for striking a note of caution here. A GDP growth of four 
percent may be a reasonably satisfactory performance for an 
economy in its third year of economic reform, but this is 
decidedly far below the potential of an economy of India's size 
and resources. As the finance minister has often reiterated in 
the past India should look forward to an annual growth rate of 
around 10 percent in the next decade and only then can it live 
up to the world's expectations of being an uncaged tiger. 
  Quite clearly, the need for the hour is to get on with the 
second phase of economic reforms without any delay. It is an 
acknowledged fact that future growth will not come to much from 
industry as from the services sector. The potential of the 
services sector in this country lies virtually untapped. The 
financial sector reforms are now under way. Once the R.N. 
Malhotra Committee's report on liberalizing the insurance sector 
is accepted by the government, one can hope for further reforms 
in this crucial area of the economy also. The financial markets 
and the capital market too are gradually getting liberalized. 
This should in near future allow the entrepreneurial talent of 
the Indian businessmen to exploit the potential availability in 
this sector in competition with foreign firms. In the financial 
sector also, more new private banks are being set up, stepping 
up the pace of economic activities in the economy through a 
transparently competitive environment. In the coming years, the 
services sector would take a clear lead in terms of the 
economy's GDP growth. And, as long as such reforms process 
continues unimpaired, there is every reason to achieve a higher 
a GDP growth of around 10 percent in the next few years.

  [Text] Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister Peres 
decided to resume the economic talks between Israel and the PLO 
in Paris this week. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that 
a Finance Ministry team will depart for Paris tomorrow. It is 
possible that the heads of the delegations, Finance Minister 
Avraham Shohat and the PLO's Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'], will 
arrive in Paris toward the end of the week. 
  At the opening of today's cabinet meeting Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin spoke with great firmness against the way in which 
the Palestinians are conducting the negotiations. The prime 
minister said he is willing to resume the Taba talks only on the 
basis of the understandings reached in Cairo. Mr. Rabin said 
that Israel is in no hurry, and that the Palestinians should 
start sweating now. According to Rabin, over the last few days 
it has transpired that we cannot count on oral understandings 
with the PLO leaders, and henceforth he will demand that all the 
understandings reached with them be written down. 
  Earlier today Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister 
Peres 
held an hour-long private meeting. The prime minister also held 
consultations with various security services elements, and this 
afternoon these consultations will continue.

  [Text] Israel will today issue an unequivocal announcement 
to the PLO in Tunis that the Taba talks will resume only on the 
understanding that the negotiations' starting point are the 
understandings already reached in Cairo. Israel insists that 
neither of the parties raise any demands that contravene these 
understandings. 
  Speaking at the end of today's cabinet session, the prime 
minister said that the draft formulated in Cairo was not an 
Israeli position paper, but rather understandings reached at the 
most senior level between Israel and the PLO. It is 
inconceivable, Yitzhaq Rabin said, not to honor understandings 
reached at such a level and to then start haggling about them. 
This kind of situation, Rabin said, raised doubts about whether 
there was any point at all in reaching such understandings. If 
the Palestinians reject the understandings, Rabin said, 
everything is open.

<F P=106> [Report by Hayim Hecht] </F>
  [Excerpt] The cabinet meeting, which has just ended, 
centered on sharp and firm remarks by Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin. It is not at all clear that the Taba talks will resume 
tomorrow, but it is clear that an Israeli team will depart for 
Paris tomorrow. Yitzhaq Rabin said that before clarifications 
are received on what and with whom we are negotiating, we will 
not resume any talks. He added Israel can resume routine 
economic and security related contacts; for example, it is 
possible to continue talks on fugitives. Rabin pointed out, 
however, that we will not return to Taba before it is clear on 
what basis the talks will be held. Rabin left some room open 
for a low-level delegation going to Taba for dealing with the 
problem of the fugitives. The heads of the delegations, 
however, will not go. 
  Rabin said he has received the impression that the 
territories do not interest 'Arafat and that he is using this 
fact against us. Rabin stressed that the controversy centers on 
the political issue rather than on 'Arafat's honor. Rabin added 
that from 'Arafat's point of view the main problem is whether he 
has control over an international border or not. 
  At this point Rabin provided some details regarding 
'Arafat's 
new demands as conveyed via the weekend fax messages: They are 
demanding the presence of policemen near the bridges, which in 
fact implies a physical PLO control over the border crossings. 
The Palestinians also demand not to see any Israelis at the 
crossing points. The solution they propose is the use of 
cameras. They are also demanding to receive total control over 
al-Nabi Musa in the Jericho area. The Palestinians also demand 
full control over the Muratas baptism site on the Jordan River. 
They also demand control over the Lido beach on the Dead Sea 
and to maintain an international presence in the enclaves. 
  There seems to be a problem regarding the Musa 'Alami 
agricultural farm, because some of the land registered to that 
farm is located east of the Jordan Valley, therefore Israel's 
proposal to hand over this farm to the PLO is problematical. 
  Minister Shim'on Shetrit asked Rabin for clarifications 
regarding Israel's security areas in Gaza and Jericho. Rabin 
said that Israel demands to retain between three to five 
kilometers between the Jericho enclave and the Jordan Valley. 
In Gaza, Israel is demanding less than that. 
  Minister Ya'aqov Tzur said that apparently the maneuvering 
room is narrowing down: 
  [Begin recording] The PLO must drop its demand for control 
over the external borders. This is not merely a tactical issue. 
It is a most significant issue and the government will see to 
it that its principles are implemented. Israel will not 
compromise over retaining control of the external borders and 
will not accept 'Arafat's demands, which in fact amount to the 
essence of a state. If the PLO returns to the spirit of the 
declaration of principles the way will remain open. We know 
that we are paying a price for the delay, but we reached point 
where we must insist on the implementation of the agreement we 
reached. [end recording] 
  I asked Minister Yosi Sarid whether the Taba talks will 
resume tomorrow: 
  [Begin recording] This is entirely unclear. If the talks 
will be based on the understandings reached in Cairo, we will be 
able to resume the talks tomorrow or even tonight. If, however, 
the basis will be Yasir 'Arafat's new demands then at this point 
there is no room for continuing the talks. At this point I do 
not know when they will continue. [end recording] 
  Prime Minister Rabin also said that if the Palestinians will 
change the agreements this will be reciprocal, and Israel will 
also demand to introduce changes. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres today decided not to resume the Taba talks for the 
time being due to the PLO's positions. Nabil Sha'th phoned 
Shim'on Peres several times today, and the two are slated to 
hold another phone conversation in the next few hours. Our 
political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports: 
  Jerusalem sources are saying that conditions are not yet 
ripe 
for resuming the Taba talks. What does this mean? In a fax 
sent by Nabil Sha'th, the PLO demands that the Taba talks will 
revisit all the issues previously negotiated in Oslo, 
Versailles, and Cairo. Israel, on the other hand, maintains that 
the document formulated during the Liaison Committee's session 
in Cairo is a binding summation of all three meetings. Israel 
contends that in Cairo the delegations managed to overcome the 
controversies which were not solved in Oslo and Versailles. 
Officials in Jerusalem today learned that not only is 'Arafat 
unwilling to approve the document formulated by Peres and 
Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas], but that the PLO wants to renegotiate 
the gaps which have apparently been bridged in Cairo. 
  Following their private meeting this morning, Yitzhaq Rabin 
and Shim'on Peres stated that Israel considers it impossible to 
resume the Taba talks for the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho 
First plan. 
  Despite the present stalemate, various sources -- some of 
them close to the PLO leadership -- assess that by next week 
conditions will ripen and that Foreign Minister Peres will find 
the right formulations to clear the way for resuming the Taba 
talks.

  [Excerpts] Israel is not prepared to resume the political 
talks with the PLO under the conditions created by 'Arafat. A 
letter to this effect signed by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres 
was faxed this evening to the PLO leaders. 
  The prime minister stated today: I have time, let the guys 
in Tunis start sweating a little now. In the meantime, cabinet 
ministers have begun floating new ideas. For example, in an 
internal session today, Minister Moshe Shahal said he believes 
we should halt the deliberations about an interim arrangement 
and proceed directly to discuss the permanent arrangement in the 
territories. Our political correspondent Gadi Sukenik reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Sukenik] [passage omitted] Israel today 
sent its reply to the heads of the Palestinian delegation in 
Cairo and Tunis by fax, as the Palestinians did. The principle 
stated in the Israeli message: Changes in the understandings may 
be discussed, but not ignored. In other words, 'Arafat should 
get off his high horse. [passage omitted] 
  Rabin and Peres today told cabinet ministers they decided to 
resume the economic talks with the PLO in Paris at once. They 
conveyed their impression that 'Arafat is not bothered by the 
situation in the territories. At the same time, they reiterated 
that the PLO's standing in the territories has been 
deteriorating and that the money promised to it has not been 
coming through. 
  The new situation is leading to new ideas. In an internal 
session today -- and only in such a forum at this point -- 
Minister Moshe Shahal said: We should drop the deliberations 
about the interim arrangement and proceed directly to a 
discussion about the permanent arrangement in the territories.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Peres says unfortunately Israel 
will not be going back to the Taba talks tomorrow. Reporter Amy 
Rhodes asked Peres for his reaction to the Jordanian press 
report that King Husayn had threatened to make a separate peace 
with Israel unless Yasir 'Arafat cooperated with him more 
closely. 
  [Begin recording] [Peres] I am for having a comprehensive 
peace with all parties, but I am for arriving at the 
comprehensive peace on an individual basis, because if we shall 
try to have comprehensive negotiations, so the ones who are 
usually late, or reluctant, or hesitant will hold back the 
negotiations. 
  [Rhodes] Will the Taba talks resume tomorrow? 
  [Peres] I am afraid not. 
  [Rhodes] What is the reason that it will be delayed? 
  [Peres] The talks in Taba need a common basis, need an 
understanding. The two faxes that we have received on Friday 
created a sort of a doubt about what is the basis for the talks 
in Taba. 
  [Rhodes] How do you plan on going about reaching another 
agreement such as the one that was reached in Cairo but not 
accepted by the Palestinians? 
  [Peres] To be true to the agreements that we have reached in 
Oslo and in Cairo and to reject anything that tries to annul it.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by political </F>
correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen at the Foreign Ministry in 
Jerusalem on 30 December--recorded] 
  [Text] [Rosen] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, senior PLO 
officials, Yasir 'Arafat, and Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh are claiming 
that an agreement was never reached at all. What is going on 
here? 
  [Peres] I must note that the two men you mentioned did not 
participate in the negotiations. However, Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 
'Abbas], who was appointed head of the delegation by Yasir 
'Arafat, appeared publicly with me to declare that both 
delegations had reached agreement. 
  [Rosen] When you arrived back in Israel last night, were you 
convinced that an agreement with the PLO had been reached? Were 
you surprised by the reactions and by what happened today? 
  [Peres] Not completely. The agreement is between the two 
delegations. I knew it had to be approved by the PLO 
leadership. I realized that there could be dissenting views 
within the PLO leadership so I was not totally surprised. 
  [Rosen] Did the statements made in Cairo yesterday, and the 
remarks made by Abu-Mazin lead you to understand that the PLO 
team was satisfied with the budding agreement? 
  [Peres] I believe the delegation felt, just as we did, that 
we had met each other half way after starting off from very 
disparate positions. I imagine that they felt that this was the 
most they could attain. I must say that most of the delegation, 
including Abu-Mazin, understand that we cannot stray far from 
the Declaration of Principles. It is impossible to constantly 
renew negotiations over the negotiations. Therefore, my 
assessment is that despite the various statements that have been 
made, the situation has not changed in any fundamental way. 
  [Rosen] What is the state of things now? What are we 
actually waiting for? 
  [Peres] The current situation is that the Taba committee can 
resume its work, and we are waiting for an official and formal 
notice from the PLO leadership regarding the joint communique 
reached yesterday. 
  [Rosen] You usually avoid using the term crisis. But have 
we not actually reached a crisis with the PLO? The PLO is not 
sticking to the agreements. 
  [Peres] Look, that is the partner we have. The PLO is the 
only partner we have to negotiate with, and we shall continue to 
do this. This is the kind of thing that is neither final, nor a 
total crisis. This is part of the negotiations process. 
  [Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Hebrew at 
1800 GMT on 30 December reports that "Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin is waiting for an official statement from the PLO 
regarding the Cairo draft agreement before making any public 
reaction. Our political correspondent Gadi Sukenik reports that 
Jerusalem is displeased with reports that Yasir 'Arafat has 
rejected the draft." Israel Television goes on to note that 
"Egyptian officials told our correspondent this evening that 
President Mubarak was disappointed with 'Arafat's attitude and 
has therefore decided to reduce the level of Egyptian 
involvement in mediation efforts between the PLO and Israel. 
Mubarak has therefore decided not to send Egyptian Foreign 
Minister 'Amr Musa to Israel for talks on this matter."]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by political </F>
correspondent Gadi Sukenik in the Tel Aviv studio "a few minutes 
ago"] 
  [Excerpts] [Sukenik] Over the weekend, after phone calls 
between 'Arafat's and Peres' offices, the PLO issued something 
between an amendment and an apology. Sa'id Kamal, the PLO's 
ambassador in Cairo, confirmed what Peres said to the effect 
that the understandings reached in Cairo were not just Israel's 
position, as the Palestinian side -- particularly Yasir 
'Abd-Rabbuh -- tried to argue. Nevertheless, the PLO stressed, 
these were not understandings between the two leaderships. 
Whatever the case may be, there is a crisis in the talks with 
the PLO and everything would seem to have been reopened. Yasir 
'Arafat, a tough negotiator, now rejects the understandings 
reached in Cairo and demands much more. [passage omitted] 
  Over the weekend, Yitzhaq Rabin went to great lengths not to 
overturn the tables, and emphasized that he is patient. He and 
Shim'on Peres must now make up their minds either to go back to 
the Taba talks or to illustrate their disappointment with 
'Arafat by initiating a delay in the resumption of the talks. 
  A few minutes ago the foreign minister told us that the 
decision would be made tomorrow and that he is in favor, in 
spite of everything, of resuming the talks. 
  [Begin recording] [Peres] The crisis is over who has more 
time. We presented proposals. Everything that is written in 
the declaration of principles is acceptable to us. We have not 
changed anything or retreated from it, and we will not change or 
retreat from it. If the PLO has time, that is all right; we 
also have time. 
  [Sukenik] Could you speculate as to what goes on in 
'Arafat's mind when he rejects all the understandings his men 
reached with you only a few days ago? 
  [Peres] He does not reject all of them, but he adds demands 
which were not discussed either in the first or second set of 
Oslo talks, in Cairo, or Versailles. We announced the 
understandings, and they were rejected. 'Arafat should know 
that Israel will not retreat from three issues: the Declaration 
of Principles, our security needs, and our announcement in the 
Knesset; we will fully honor what the prime minister and I 
stated in the Knesset. In this context, we tried to be as 
considerate as possible of Palestinian feelings. We do not want 
to humiliate them, but we will stick to our principles. We will 
implement everything we promised, but we will not agree to 
anything that harms our security. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F>
Karmit Gay and political correspondent Shlomo Raz -- live] 
  [Text] [Gay] Good morning, Mr. Peres. 
  [Peres] Good morning. 
  [Gay] Is Israel really sick and tired of 'Arafat's antics? 
Has he really put us back to square one? 
  [Peres] We are not sick and tired of anything. We offered 
the Palestinians a proposal which they accepted. Now they do 
not want to implement it, so let them wait. 
  [Gay] What transpired between Cairo and Tunis? 
  [Peres] In my opinion nothing transpired. The two 
delegations worked out a document of understanding which was 
publicized when Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas] and I made a joint 
television statement. Now the PLO leadership must decide whether 
they accept it or reject it. If they decide to reject it so be 
it. 
  [Gay] Is there a communication breakdown between 'Arafat and 
Abu-Mazin? 
  [Peres] I do not want to deal with their own internal 
problems. The Palestinian delegation to Cairo was sent on 
behalf of the PLO, not Israel. I do not understand Yasir 
'Arafat's claims. First, he demands that Israel fulfill 
everything it has promised. I want him to cite even one example 
of an issue which we have not fulfilled to the letter. Two, I 
do not understand the example he makes of the term Bantustan, 
because here everything remains open and within a short period 
we will have to discuss the future of the autonomy. I also 
explained to the Palestinians that they are not arguing over 
territory, but rather over time. 'Arafat is comparing the 
[Jericho] enclave to an Indian enclave. This is nonsense, 
because here everybody will be free to travel. They will also 
be given a police force which they have never had; they are also 
being given a Palestinian track inside the Israeli border 
terminal. I do not understand what he is talking about. We 
have seen several times in history, however, that the 
Palestinians have rejected opportunities. I hope they will not 
repeat the same mistake. 
  [Raz] Mr. Peres, do you think the Taba talks should be 
resumed despite the fairly bleak description of the situation 
with the PLO which you just offered? 
  [Peres] I did not paint a bleak picture. I think the 
current debate is within the PLO itself rather than with us. 
The debate with us has ended. 
  [Raz] Do you think it is advisable to resume the Taba talks 
already this week? 
  [Peres] We are not playing the offended party. The talks 
can resume this week or next week on the basis of the 
understandings reached. It is impossible to resume the talks 
based on that which runs contrary to the understandings. 
  [Gay] You are saying that everything is now an internal 
PLO problem. Yo'el Singer, one of the Oslo agreement 
formulators, said that time is acting against all parties, 
because a delay could endanger the agreement and bring about the 
dissolution of the PLO. We will then find ourselves confronting 
dozens of small organizations unable to communicate with us. 
  [Peres] I, indeed, believe the delay is a negative and 
unwarranted thing, but we are not responsible for it and we 
should not be held accountable for it. I want to state 
unequivocally that all the commitments we have undertaken -- to 
our Knesset as well -- we will fulfill to the letter. Regarding 
the Jericho enclave, for example, the Palestinians wanted access 
to the Dead Sea and to the Jordan River. We explained to them 
that we told the Knesset there will not be even one Jewish 
settlement in the Jericho enclave. Those who want access to the 
Dead Sea actually want to have Jewish settlements in the Jericho 
enclave. We told them that at the present stage of the 
negotiations we will not accept this. We also told them that 
Israel's defense line goes all the way to 'Ayn Fashkhah. It 
cannot be broken and we have no intentions of breaking it. We 
were consequently surprised by seeing this issue raised again. 
If 'Arafat compares the Jericho enclave to an Indian enclave, 
then Israel is certainly unwilling to turn the crossing terminal 
into an entrance to the Wild West. You must remember that all 
those crossing the border are not only entering the autonomy, 
but Israel as well. Once inside they can travel anywhere they 
want to. Our positions, therefore, are not capricious or 
arbitrary, but are rather to the point. This is also why the 
Palestinians accepted them. 
  [Raz] Mr. Peres, are you not concerned by this pattern, 
wherein we reach some agreement and then return to square one 
because 'Arafat does not approve it. We saw Abu-Mazin stand by 
your side and nod his head in agreement when you spoke about the 
Cairo understandings. 
  [Peres] Yes, this is why I said it is 'Arafat's problem, not 
ours. 'Arafat is entitled to reject it if he believes it does 
not serve the Palestinians' interests. Yet he must also 
question what his alternatives are. 
  [Gay] He is nevertheless our partner. 
  [Peres] Yes, he is our partner. If we cannot understand 
what drives 'Arafat, he at least must understand what guides us. 
We are guided by total commitment to every word we spoke and to 
Israel's security needs. 
  [Raz] How can you be sure that after an agreement will be 
concluded and finalized they will not backtrack again? 
  [Peres] The Palestinians should answer this question, not 
us. Israel is not divesting itself of anything. If there is no 
agreement we will keep everything we currently possess. 
  [Gay] Are we participating in an oriental bazaar here? 
  [Peres] I do not want to use any descriptions which deviate 
from the negotiations. I am conducting negotiations and I want 
to preserve the honor of the other party. Your description, 
however, is not far from the truth. We all find it painful to 
sit down, negotiate, agree, and then to have to say that no 
agreement has been reached. This is the strangest thing I have 
seen. Nabil Sha'th has sent us a draft with some stylistic 
amendments to the agreement. Now does this indicate that an 
agreement has been attained, or not? 
  [Gay] Does this point to what we can expect in future? We 
might sign an agreement and then after we withdraw from the 
enclave they will retract and we will find ourselves in square 
one. 
  [Peres] It takes two sides to reach an agreement, whereas 
nonagreement is an option of any of the two sides. If they do 
not adhere to the agreement there will be no agreement. The 
agreement exists as long as the two sides honor it. If one side 
tries to violate it there will be no agreement. This 
reciprocity must be preserved all along the way. 
  [Gay] Thank you very much, Foreign Minister Peres.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F>
unidentified correspondent; Peres speaking in English fading 
into Hungarian translation; place and date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] A definitive settlement of the 
Palestinian-Israeli conflict cannot be expected by tomorrow; but 
it can now be expected. Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, 
with whom I recorded a brief interview, is himself visibly 
confident. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent] Mr. Peres, do you think 
that Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] will be able to prevent 
the agreement? 
  [Peres] They might try to prevent the agreement coming into 
being but I do not think they will succeed. The majority of 
Palestinians, just as the majority of Israelis, too, want peace. 
Consequently, the decision is not in Hamas' hands. They murder 
people and they would like to annihilate the peace process 
itself by murdering people, but I do not think they will get far 
with this. 
  [Correspondent] How do you see the future of the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement after the postponement of the 
first deadline for the Israeli military withdrawal? 
  [Peres] It was not a postponement. You know, the parties 
concerned agreed in Oslo that they would allow one month after 
the signing for informal meetings; they allowed another two 
months for the agreement to be translated, so that every tiny 
detail could be clarified. But it turned out that the time at 
our disposal was extremely short. We are unable to settle all 
necessary matters in two months. Now we have to clarify just 
how much time we still need. 
  [Correspondent] Finally, how do you see the possibility of 
Syria's involvement? 
  [Peres] Well, we would like the Syrians to be involved in 
the 
settlement efforts, since we would like to put a full-stop to 
the old conflicts in the region and we would like to build a new 
Middle East for the future. Naturally, we need new partners for 
this, partners with whom we can work together. At present, 
Syria is not showing too much flexibility [hajlekonysag]. But 
it is also a fact that at the time of the latest visit by U.S. 
State Secretary Warren Christopher, Syrian President Hafiz 
al-Asad indicated with certain gestures that Syria does not wish 
to be left out of the negotiations.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres told the Knesset 
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee today that Israel would 
not withdraw from its security positions and would honor its 
commitment not to uproot Jewish settlements within the framework 
of the interim arrangement. Tamar Asalem reports from the 
Knesset: 
  Israel will honor the agreements reached in Cairo in the 
spirit of the Declaration of Principles, Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres said upon leaving the Knesset Foreign Affairs and 
Defense Committee. The committee was interrupted twice because 
of telephone calls from 'Arafat's political adviser Nabil Sha'th. 
  [Begin Peres recording] Mr. Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas] and I 
informed everybody about the agreements we reached in Cairo. We 
stand by them. A person's word has to be honored. A debate is 
legitimate until agreement is reached. After that, agreements 
must be honored. [end recording] 
  [Later in the newsreel, Mr. Peres, after talking with 
Sha'th, 
said "`the conditions are not yet ripe for renewing the Taba 
talks.' The two exchanged several more faxes, but the dispute 
between the two sides has not yet been resolved. Peres told the 
Knesset committee that Israel is demanding from the PLO that 
there be no deviations from the Cairo agreements in future 
negotiations."] 
  On the security of the settlements and the border crossings, 
the foreign minister explained that there is no room for 
compromise. 
  [Begin Peres recording] We are not asking for new 
agreements. We are trying to understand how the Palestinians 
feel, yet we insist on Israel's security. [end recording] 
  Responding to a question on Kibbutz Netzarim, Mr. Peres said 
there might be a need to revise security costs for the isolated 
settlement. He said Netzarim would not constitute part of the 
negotiations with the Palestinians, but would be brought up in 
an internal debate. We might have to ask ourselves about 
resources and the size of the settlement, but I would not like 
such a debate to be held in the shadow of the negotiations, 
Peres added. 
  The foreign minister also referred to the upcoming 
Clinton-al-Asad summit and said that despite the high 
expectations in the United States, his expectations were sober. 
Severing links between Syria and the terrorist organizations 
would be a central issue in the negotiations with them, Peres 
said.

  [Text] Beirut, Jan 1 (AFP) -- A delay in reaching agreement 
on autonomy in the occupied territories could signal the demise 
of the Israeli-Palestinian accord and the collapse of the PLO, a 
senior Israeli official warned Saturday [1 January]. 
  In an interview with the Arabic-language daily AL-HAYAH, 
published in London, Beirut and other Arab capitals, Yoel 
Zinger, said: "We must expect a delay of a few weeks or months, 
but this situation must not drag out further since the agreement 
risks meeting the same fate as that of Camp David." 
  Zinger is the Israeli foreign ministry's legal advisor who 
helped formulate the declaration of principles for progressive 
Palestinian autonomy in the occupied territories signed 
September 13 in Washington. 
  Subsidiary clauses of the 1978 Camp David accords between 
Israel and Egypt calling for proposed autonomy in the occupied 
territories have remained a dead letter. 
  Zinger added: "A further delay in implementation (of the 
autonomy accord) could lead to the collapse of the PLO." 
  He said Israel had wanted to negotiate a peace deal with the 
Palestine Liberation Organization because the organization was 
in danger of disappearing. 
  "We figured it was in nobody's interest for it to disappear 
and for Israel to remain alone facing several organizations, 
none of which is able to speak in the name of all the 
Palestinian people and to impose itself on them," he added. 
  Israel and the PLO have still not reached agreement on 
control of international crossing points on the Gaza Strip and 
in the West Bank town of Jericho, the first regions earmarked 
for autonomy, a senior PLO official said Friday. 
  The disagreement has delayed the withdrawal of Israeli 
troops 
from Gaza and Jericho, which had been scheduled for December 13 
under the terms of the autonomy accord. 
  Palestinian negotiators have proposed to their Israeli 
counterparts the resumption Monday in Egypt of talks on 
implementation of the accord, the PLO's representative in Egypt 
said Friday. 
  Sayid Kamal told AFP the PLO was waiting for Israel's reply 
on resuming the negotiations, which began October 13 in the 
Egyptian Red Sea resort of Tabah.

  [Text] A large majority of the Israeli public supports the 
promotion of talks with the Palestinians, and only a minority is 
in favor of stopping or freezing the talks at once. These are 
the findings of an public opinion poll commissioned by Labor for 
private consumption. According to the poll, 60 percent of the 
public supports the promotion of the talks and, in part, demands 
that it be advanced rapidly while making compromises. Only 17 
percent favor terminating the talks and 13 percent say they 
should be frozen. These are the findings of a poll conducted 
over a representative sample of the Jewish population during the 
last week of 1993. 
  The poll also shows that the public mainly demands that the 
government see to it that terror stops, but does not oppose 
making compromises. The option of a peace agreement and the 
establishment of a Palestinian state with agreed-on borders won 
a majority of 47 percent of those surveyed, while 27 percent 
strongly oppose it, and 13 percent are still hesitant about it. 
Only 33 percent oppose the abandoning of Judaea and Samaria 
settlements in return for peace with the Palestinians, while 
nearly 40 percent are willing to support this. 
  According to the poll, conducted between 27 and 30 December, 
a majority of the public supports the Oslo and Washington 
agreements with the PLO, viewing them as correct steps toward 
peace between Israel and the Palestinians. This is the view of 
53 percent of those polled, while 28 percent believe the steps 
to be wrong. 
  Nearly 70 percent of the public will regard a peace 
agreement 
with a Palestinian autonomy an achievement, while 22 percent 
will not. 
  The continuation of terrorism is an issue seriously 
troubling 
the public. A large majority, some 70 percent, said that if 
terror continues, they will view it as a failure of the 
government policy. The public will also regard it a failure if 
the PLO fails to impose order in the Gaza Strip and terror from 
there continue. Some 52 percent of those polled stated they 
will regard this a failure.

<F P=106> [Report by Yehuda Tzur] </F>
  [Text] An unsigned underground leaflet addressed to 
regular and reserve IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers, 
calling for action against what it terms "the takeover of the 
IDF, which works in the service of the left wing, by the left 
wing," has been recently published by extreme right-wing 
circles. Thousands of copies have been distributed to soldiers 
by a body calling itself The Popular Committee -- the IDF 
[Hava'ada Ha'amamit -- Tzahal]. The leaflet says: "We, a group 
of reserve officers and soldiers, have decided to organize 
against this trend. We appeal to anyone who is ready to take 
action and to anyone who has information about such phenomena, 
asking him to contact The Popular Committee -- the IDF, which is 
a body affiliated with recently established action committees 
that monitor the political exploitation of state organizations 
and state budgets. We need every piece of information and are 
willing to help soldiers who want to fight against the 
phenomenon." 
  The soldiers are requested to send their information to 
Jerusalem post office boxes whose numbers are listed in the 
leaflet. According to the leaflet, the IDF is ceasing to be a 
popular army and becoming an army in the service of the left 
wing. The leaflet notes that the troops orders drafted by the 
chief education officer and disseminated in every army sector 
infuriated the right wing. Furthermore, reserves troops 
beginning a tour of duty receive instructions in which settlers 
are presented in one category with terrorist organizations, it 
says. 
  It goes on to say that IDF generals and other senior 
officers, who oppose the peace process, are not allowed to voice 
their views, while dovish senior officers are constantly 
permitted to do the same. The latter include Major General 'Uzi 
Dayan, Brigadier General Yomtov Sami', Brig. Gen. Doron Almog, 
Southern Command Commander Matan Vilna'i, "and the worst was 
when that general who holds plainly left-wing views, Major 
General Shahaq, the deputy chief of staff, went to Oslo to make 
gestures and concessions to terrorists." 
  The leaflet adds that "it is no wonder that in such an 
atmosphere, the introduction of a Torah scroll into a place as 
sacred to Judaism as Joseph's Tomb in Nabulus is seen as 
provocation by the leftist-Arab government, and that IDF 
soldiers are ordered to bar the celebrations in the midst of 
Hanukkah. It is no wonder that in such an atmosphere, IDF 
troops are summoned to block the way to Joseph's Tomb although 
it involves a desecration of the Sabbath." 
  The leaflet further says that while the IDF was reluctant to 
appoint Dani Nave as its spokesman, it did appoint Avi Bnayahu, 
"who works for the left-wing 'AL HAMISHMAR newspaper, promoting 
him to colonel. The IDF Radio is a left-wing bastion and a 
training ground for future left-wing reporters, and [IDF Radio 
director] Moshe Shlonsky, who was brought in from that left-wing 
television, is running the place as if it was a private Peace 
Now estate, and an announcer who said on air that Rabbi Levinger 
is the murderer from Hebron has kept his job, receiving a mere 
reprimand." 
  MAPAM [United Workers Party] Chairman Hanan Erez has warned 
against the attempts by anonymous radical circles going under 
the name of The Popular Committee -- the IDF, to exploit the 
army, undermining its standing and the public confidence in it 
and its senior commander through their efforts to sabotage the 
peace process. 
  Hanan Erez called on Ori Or, chairman of the Knesset Foreign 
Affairs and Defense Committee, to take immediate action against 
the dangerous phenomenon.

<F P=106> [Article by Aluf Ben: "The Role of the Bad Guys"] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Israeli-Egyptian relationship is conducted 
along two parallel tracks. President Husni Mubarak and his aide 
Usamah al-Baz are the good guys who steer the peace process, 
mediate between Israel and the Palestinians, and dispatch 
messages of friendship to the other side of the border. 
  In this relationship, the role of the bad guys is played by 
Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and his assistant Nabil Fahmi, who 
heads the Egyptian delegation to the arms control talks. These 
two lead the Egyptian effort to disarm Israel of its nuclear 
capability, waging a relentless battle against Israel in every 
possible international forum: the multilateral talks, the 
United Nations, the International Atomic Energy Agency 
committees. 
  The Egyptians want Israel to sign the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and to divest itself of its 
strategic assets. If not at once, it should at least occur in 
agreed-on stages as part of an open political dialogue on 
nuclear issues. Cairo rejects the Israeli stand that the 
process should start with confidence-building steps by countries 
in the region, such as the creation of circles of communication 
and the laying open of military activities, and that the nuclear 
debate should be postponed until "due time," after peace 
arrangements mature and stabilize. [passage omitted] 
  Musa's and Fahmi's inexorable stance is explained by 
personal 
and political motives: Both had worked for the United Nations 
in the past, during which time they embraced regional nuclear 
disarmament as a policy line -- which also happened to 
contribute to their personal promotion. The battle against 
Israel is explained also by Egypt's aspirations to lead the Arab 
world and its desire to show that even after the peace 
agreement, it remains the leading factor in the Arab quest for 
balance with Israel. 
  Arab countries do not fully subscribe to the Egyptian line. 
The Palestinians do not fear Israel's nuclear potential, and 
neither does Jordan. The Syrians believe that territorial 
restitution and the solution of the Palestinian problem come 
before the nuclear disarmament of Israel, as Syrian expert 
Zuhayr Di'ab has recently written. The Gulf states are more 
concerned about Iran and Iraq. Egypt has thus failed to form an 
Arab bloc united in its refusal to sign the chemical 
nonproliferation treaty until Israel joins the NPT. The Gulf 
and Maghreb states adopted the U.S. line and joined the chemical 
treaty. 
  Israel is not particularly worried about the confrontation 
with Egypt in the arms control talks. Israel is not interested 
in accelerating the arms control debates, and it adheres to its 
timeframe: first peace, and then the nuclear issue. Various 
Israeli elements reacted to the Egyptian stand saying that "they 
can say it 10 times a day," or that "they say they will go on 
talking, so we will listen and do whatever we deem appropriate." 
Yet the introduction of the nuclear waste issue into the 
environmental talks and at the steering committee talks 
infuriated Jerusalem, because it contravened an earlier Israeli 
consent to explain the problem at the bilateral talks. 
  Some believe, however, that the battle for the deactivation 
of the Israeli deterrent power has a detrimental long-term 
impact on the peace process, because this attempt to divest 
Israel of strategic assets vital for its sense of security in an 
era of political concessions is forcing Israel to assume a 
self-defensive attitude. People who embrace this view find it 
difficult to buy the appeasing messages conveyed to Jerusalem by 
Usamah al-Baz. They point to the fact that Mubarak has given 
Musa full freedom of action in his nuclear war on Israel. In 
the meantime, the relationship with Egypt is going to be 
conducted with smiles on the peace tracks -- as if there was no 
nuclear issue, and with harsh confrontations on the arms control 
tracks, as if there was no peace process.

  [Text] A reliable security source has denied a report 
carried by some news media on an attempt to assassinate the 
president of the republic a month ago. This report is 
completely untrue, the source said, and called on all mass media 
not to publish such biased reports until they are verified by 
the competent security agencies. He also cautioned the citizens 
against believing such rumors, which seek to cast doubts on and 
shake confidence in the march to security and stability, which 
has gained strength over the past three years.

  [Text] Hizballah Secretary General Shaykh Hasan Nasrallah 
has criticized the U.S. attitude toward the Lebanese detainees 
in the prisons of the Israeli enemy and its agents. He said 
that the United States is not worthy of playing any humanitarian 
role. At a ceremony held by Hizballah in al-Ghubayrah in 
Beirut, he said that the United States shows concern only about 
the seven Israeli soldiers, but Shaykh 'Abd-al-Karim 'Ubayd, 
hundreds of Lebanese detainees kidnapped from their homes in 
organized terrorist operations, and thousands of Palestinians 
detained in jails in occupied Palestine do not move the feelings 
of the United States or Christopher.

  [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz has stressed that 
the Israeli military escalation in south Lebanon is aimed at 
diverting attention from the main objective of the peace 
negotiations to discussions on security. He said in a press 
meeting this afternoon that Lebanon must not yield to this or 
accept the replacement of basic and substantive issues by 
security proposals. 
  Concerning relations between Israel and the Vatican, Buwayz 
hoped they would remain within the context of urging and 
pressuring Israel into implementing international resolutions 
and complying with the peace principles drafted in Madrid.

  [Text] Beirut, Jan 1 (AFP) -- Lebanon's pro-Iranian 
fundamentalist groups on Saturday [1 January] denounced the 
Israeli-Vatican accord, with one group calling for a boycott of 
a visit here in May by Pope John Paul II. 
  The Shiite Moslem Hizballah denounced the Holy See's 
recognition of Israel as a "historic sin against Christ and all 
humanity. How can a state created in the name of Christ 
recognize the legality of an entity established by usurpation 
and injustice?" it asked. 
  Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli, former Hizballah secretary general 
and leader of the group's radical wing, said in comments 
published by the press that a link exists between the pope's 
visit to Lebanon and recognition of Israel. 
  "This visit becomes a basis for evil and action that does 
not 
serve the interests of the Lebanese," he said. Al-Tufayli 
expressed surprise that "the Vatican speaks of peace when it 
signs a document recognizing the Zionist entity." 
  The spiritual leader of Hizballah, Shaykh Muhammad Husayn 
Fadlallah, on Friday also denounced the Israeli-Vatican accord 
as ignoring the "teachings of Jesus Christ." 
  Shaykh Mahir Hammud, the political director of the Sunni 
Assembly of Moslem Ulema (religious scholars) which is close to 
Iran, called on "the free forces" in Lebanon to boycott the 
pope's visit. 
  He said the accord signed Thursday in Jerusalem between the 
Vatican and Israel, which calls for diplomatic ties this year, 
is based on "the principles of the Zionist movement, not those 
of the Vatican." 
  Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz said: "We would have 
preferred it if Israel's recognition by the Vatican had taken 
place after the Jewish state complied with the principles of 
peace decided at the Madrid conference." 
  The Madrid conference in October 1991 launched the 
Arab-Israeli peace talks. 
  The Vatican-Israel pact should "at least be part of pressure 
on Israel to execute international resolutions," Buwayz added. 
  Lebanon has repeatedly called for Israel to comply with U.N. 
Security Council Resolution 425 to withdraw from south Lebanon.

  [Text] 'Allamah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah has stressed that 
the Vatican's recognition of Israel is not a Christian 
recognition. He noted that the new year marks the death of an 
old era and the birth of a new one. He added: We told the 
Vatican, which we respect, that if Christ were here now he would 
expel the Jews from the temple as he did the thieves, because 
the Jews are the thieves of security, politics, and economy. 
Therefore, the Vatican's recognition of Israel is not Christian 
because we believe in Christ's values, which are ones of right 
and justice. To recognize Israel, he added, is to recognize its 
injustice against the Arabs and the Palestinians. 
  'Allamah Fadlallah noted that the United States stands 
against any righteous and just position in the Third World and 
is working with its full power against the Islamists and to 
besiege the Islamic Republic of Iran. He added: While we 
believe that the United States is the enemy of the peoples and 
justice, we have no problem with the American people but rather 
our problem is with the U.S. Administration. Our problem with 
this administration is that there is no U.S. policy in the 
region, there is an Israeli policy.

  [Excerpt] Progressive Socialist Party Leader Minister Walid 
Junblatt has condemned the Vatican's recognition of Israel and 
described it as an alliance hostile to Arabism and Islam. This 
action confirms Western-Jewish plotting against the region and 
its peoples, resources, and identity. He said that the 
Vatican's recognition of Israel 500 years after the fall of 
Granada is a Zionist Jewish victory in the world, particularly 
in the mother Christian church in Rome. 
  Junblatt added: Perhaps we cannot assess now all 
implications of this Western-Zionist alliance, but we can say 
that our Arab identity and our Islamic identity are in danger. 
Pope John Paul's upcoming visits to Lebanon and occupied 
Palestine come within this context and cap this alliance. Any 
other talk about the pope's visit is meaningless. He said: The 
church leaders in Lebanon--who now advocate human rights, 
freedom, and other resounding slogans--were mute when Beirut was 
pounded during the Israeli invasion and when the Lebanese 
Government signed the 17 May accord with the Israeli Government.

  [Text] Marj 'Uyun, Lebanon, Jan 1 (AFP) -- Israel's proxy 
militia in south Lebanon came under attack on Saturday [1 
January] but suffered no casualties, the South Lebanon Army 
(SLA) militia said. 
  Guerrillas opened fire with rocket-propelled grenades and 
heavy machine guns at an SLA position in Sujud on the edge of 
Israel's self-declared "security zone," the militia said. 
  The attack was claimed in a statement issued in Beirut by a 
hitherto unknown movement, "The Arm of the National Revolution." 
  The group said the Muhammad Salim group of that movement 
carried out the attack. Salim, who was killed five years ago, 
was a leader of the pro-Damascus secular National Social Syrian 
Party in Lebanon. 
  Elsewhere, guerrillas fired three Katyusha rockets overnight 
Friday at the areas around Marj 'Uyun, headquarters of the 
Israeli army and SLA in the occupied zone, but caused no 
casualties, the police said. 
  On Tuesday the pro-Iranian Hizballah militia pounded the 
security zone, notably Marj 'Uyun, firing more than 100 Katyusha 
rockets and heavy artillery shells, and launched some 20 attacks 
against SLA positions. 
  Israeli helicopters carried out a series of retaliatory 
raids 
against positions of the fundamentalist movement which left four 
people dead, including three Hizballah guerrillas. 
  Hizballah has spearheaded daily attacks on Israeli and SLA 
forces in south Lebanon since Israel and the Palestine 
Liberation Organization signed a limited Palestinian autonomy 
accord on September 13 in Washington. 
  The anti-Israel attacks come ahead of a summit this month in 
Geneva between U.S. President Bill Clinton and his Syrian 
counterpart Hafiz al-Asad, to discuss the resumption of Syrian- 
Israeli and Lebanese-Israeli peace talks.

  [Text] An Information Ministry spokesman has stated the 
following: The news by AFP about negotiations between Syrian 
and Israeli officials in European capitals is unfounded and 
fabricated. The sources from which it has derived this 
information are liars and harm the credibility of the agency 
itself. If AFP were not one of the world's most far-reaching 
agencies, we would not have replied to these allegations, 
especially because Syria, as is known, adheres to the framework 
of the Madrid peace conference and to the Washington talks that 
stemmed from that framework.
