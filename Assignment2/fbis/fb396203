  [Text] Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jabir, Kuwaiti first deputy 
prime minister and foreign minister, has handed a letter from 
the amir of Kuwait to his brother His Majesty Sultan Qabus 
Bin-Sa'id of Oman. The letter concerns bilateral relations 
between the two countries and ways of giving them impetus and 
bolstering them in all spheres on the basis of the progress of 
the GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council], the situation in the Arab 
and international arenas, and issues of mutual concern. 
  Before leaving Abu Dhabi earlier today, Shaykh Sabah 
al-Ahmad 
al-Jabir stressed that Kuwait would not attend any Arab summit 
conference that may be convened to bring about Arab 
reconciliation unless the causes of Arab disputes had been 
removed first. 
  In a statement to some Arab correspondents, he said that 
Kuwait's stance vis-a-vis Arab reconciliation had not changed, 
stressing that reconciliation may be discussed once the main 
cause that has created the Arab dispute had been resolved. 
  The first deputy prime minister and foreign minister 
stressed 
that there were no differences in perception among GCC states 
with regards to reconciliation. He pointed out that the GCC 
states' stance emphasized the need for any reconciliation to be 
preceded by confronting the wrongdoings committed. 
  In his statement, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jabir stressed 
that the GCC was the mainstay of security in the region. He 
said that agreement was reached at the Riyadh summit to develop 
the strength of the Peninsula Shield force and increase the 
number of its troops in order for it to become a shield for 
protecting the region's countries. [passage omitted] 
  The first deputy prime minister and foreign minister 
reaffirmed Kuwait's welcome of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement 
as an initial step toward a just and comprehensive peace. He 
denied that there were contacts between Kuwait and the PLO.

  [Excerpts] Refugee Affairs Minister Walid Junblatt, 
speaking to the QATARI NEWS AGENCY after a meeting with Qatari 
Amir Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani, announced that he is 
committed to the al-Ta'if Accord, wants to see it improved, and 
does not want a return to the pre-accord situation. [passage 
omitted] 
  Asked to comment on a connection between the Syrian presence 
in Lebanon and the situation in the south, he said there is no 
such connection. He added: Since there is a clear 
international decision to implement UN Security Council 
Resolution 425, let the major powers pressure Israel to 
implement it. 
  He said the Syrian presence in Lebanon is an issue that 
concerns only the Lebanese and Syrian Governments. 
  Commenting on the peace process, Junblatt asserted that 
there 
can be no peace between the strong and the weak. He asked: 
Could 'Arafat regain Jerusalem, get rid of the settlements, and 
establish a state on his own? 
  Junblatt said there are ambiguous points in Oslo's secret 
agreement and Washington's public agreement. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sanaa, Jan 5 (AFP)--Troops fired in the air to 
disperse demonstrators protesting over price rises in the 
southern Yemeni town of Ta'izz, witnesses said Wednesday [5 
January]. 
  There was no report of casualties from Tuesday night's 
clashes, according to the witnesses reached by telephone. 
  Armed police were out in force and shops closed in the 
capital Sanaa on Wednesday during peaceful protests. 
  The demonstrations followed a fall in the value of the riyal 
which has pushed up consumer prices. 
  It was trading at more than 70 to the dollar on the black 
market this week, compared with 60 a week ago. The official is 
rate is 12 to the dollar. 
  The central bank has been unable to prop up the riyal 
because 
of its meagre foreign currency reserves. 
  The economic situation has been exacerbated by a long 
running 
dispute between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, a northerner, 
and his deputy, 'Ali Salim al-Bid, a southerner, over how to run 
the country. 
  Yemen, in the southwest corner of the Arabian peninsula, is 
one of the world's poorest countries, with a per capita income 
of 500 dollars per year.

  [Text] The Presidential Council met today under 
Presidential Council Chairman brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih. 
  The Council examined the economic situation in the country, 
including price hikes, the sharp deterioration in the exchange 
rate of the Yemeni currency, as well as the difficulties and 
increased suffering this has caused to citizens in terms of 
overburdening their living conditions. 
  The Presidential Council regretted the negative and 
far-reaching repercussions of the continuing political crisis on 
the overall situation in our country, particularly on the 
economic and development levels, not to mention the climate of 
psychological and social instability it has created. 
  The Presidential Council affirmed the need for the 
government 
to shoulder its responsibilities by taking necessary and rapid 
measures to remedy the economic situation and bring the cost of 
living as well as the monetary and financial situation under 
control. It also affirmed the need for the public, private, and 
mixed sector organizations to play their roles and shoulder 
their responsibilities by ensuring the availability of basic 
commodities, achieving price stability, and easing the citizens' 
burdens. 
  The Presidential Council instructed the government to take 
firm measures against those who tamper with prices, hoard 
commodities, and speculate on the national currency, and to 
rapidly refer them to the Public Prosecution so it may take the 
proper legal measures against them. It also asked the 
government to activate the state agencies and organizations to 
achieve the administrative reform that would eliminate public 
negligence and apathy and promote services within the state's 
administrative agencies, facilities, and organizations. 
  The Council also asked the government to draw up and 
implement an effective monetary and financial policy that would 
ease the citizens' economic burdens and their difficult living 
conditions in order to thwart the efforts of the enemies of 
unity and democracy to sabotage the economy and speculate on the 
national currency so as to weaken it and create bottlenecks to 
bring about indignation and anger among the public, undermine 
national unity, and foment riots and sabotage, which only harm 
the national economy and the higher national interests. 
  The Presidential Council urged the brother citizens to 
demonstrate vigilance and awareness to thwart these hostile 
schemes, and also to cooperate with the competent agencies to 
help them perform their duties in order to safeguard public 
security and stability within the society. 
  During today's session, the Presidential Council examined 
several issues as well as national, regional, and international 
developments. It was also apprised of the activities carried 
out by the Presidential Council chairman and members last week. 
  The Council expressed satisfaction over the growing 
improvement in Yemeni-Qatari ties, and also over the existing 
fraternal cooperation between the two fraternal countries. It 
voiced its appreciation of the positive stand of the fraternal 
Qataris, who are eager to see us cope with the current situation 
in the homeland, not to mention their support for Yemeni unity. 
  The Presidential Council addressed several topics listed on 
its agenda and adopted the appropriate decisions.

  [Text] At a session held today under Speaker Shaykh 
'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, the House of Representatives 
endorsed the 3d Protocol of the Constitution of the Universal 
Postal Union [UPU] approved at the Hamburg Congress of 1984, as 
well as the documents of the UPU's 20th Congress held in 
Washington in 1989 with sufficient votes. 
  The House had earlier discussed voting on Republican Decree 
No. 33 of 1992, which concerns the salaries and pensions of the 
Armed Forces and security personnel, in light of the provisions 
enshrined in Articles 83 and 130 of the bylaws of the House of 
Representatives. The House postponed voting on the 
aforementioned decree to its next session. 
  At the outset of its session today, the House discussed the 
overall economic situation, and particularly the declining 
exchange rate of the Yemeni currency, the exorbitant cost of 
living, and price hikes of staples, foremost among which are 
food supplies, medicines, and other basic survival requirements 
throughout the Republic of Yemen. The House decided to hold a 
general debate on this issue in the presence of government 
ministers in the session it will hold on the morning of Monday 
[10 January], God willing, to make firm decisions to address the 
people's living conditions, remedy the situation of the Yemeni 
currency, and accord due attention to public issues that concern 
citizens throughout the country. 
  The House asked the House committee assigned the task of 
finding the facts pertaining to the current political crisis to 
continue its duties in light of the accomplishments it has thus 
far made, and to inform the House of the results of the tasks it 
will undertake during the next phase without any delay. 
  For the Ministry of Transportation, the session was attended 
by Ahmad Hasan Qa'id, director general of the Public Postal 
Organization, and 'Ali Muhammad al-Qasim, director general of 
the Postal Services Department.

  [Text] Presidential Council Chairman brother Lieutenant 
General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, commander in chief of the Armed 
Forces, today met with the brother Armed Forces commanders. 
Addressing them, he commended the meetings held among Armed 
Forces commanders in both Sanaa and Aden to discuss the 
situation of the Armed Forces in light of the ongoing crisis in 
the homeland in order to avert the use of the Armed Forces in 
the political conflicts that threaten the homeland's sovereignty 
and undermine the accomplishments of the revolution and people, 
namely, unity and democracy. He said that this crisis has 
gravely harmed the national economy as well as the citizens' 
living conditions, thanks to the price hikes and high cost of 
living it has caused. The crisis has also affected our military 
units and combatants, although combatants are well aware, 
probably more than others, of the tragedies and calamities 
brought about by fragmentation. Similarly, they are aware of 
the consequences of conflicts and disputes, he argued. 
  The brother Presidential Council chairman noted that the 
Armed Forces are a shield for the homeland and unity, rather 
than a tool to be used to protect persons, parties, or 
organizations. They must be kept away from any political 
conflicts or partisan differences, because this would jeopardize 
the homeland's sovereignty as well as its territorial integrity. 
  The brother Presidential Council chairman said that 
differences among political forces are a natural development and 
can be resolved through responsible national dialogue. However, 
he said that differences within the Armed Forces are 
unjustifiable, because they could bring catastrophes and 
tragedies to the people, homeland, and future generations. Past 
events are a testimony to what I am saying, he added. He 
pointed out that the Armed Forces personnel, thanks to unity, 
have become brothers and comrades in arms. Their mission right 
now, he said, is to safeguard this great accomplishment scored 
by dear sacrifices. He urged the Armed Forces personnel to 
confront the advocates of division, fragmentation, and 
secession; those who foment sedition; as well as all those who 
are attempting to make our people relive the times of division 
and conflict, to take them backward, or to push them into the 
abyss. The homeland, he said, is the property of neither 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, nor 'Ali Salim al-Bid, or others, for that 
matter. The homeland belongs to all Yemenis, he said. All 
zealous citizens must oppose falsehood without fear. Likewise, 
they must confront the enemies of the homeland and its unity. 
  The Presidential Council chairman touched on the economic 
situation, which has been adversely affected by the political 
crisis, its repercussions, as well as its impact on the 
citizens' living conditions and their peace of mind. He 
affirmed the need for the government to shoulder its 
responsibilities to ease the citizens' burdens, remedy the 
economic situation, halt increasing price hikes and speculation 
on the national currency. He affirmed his confidence that our 
people's sons, headed by the Armed Forces personnel who forged a 
matchless glory on 22 May 1990, will not abandon this great 
accomplishment. They are willing to make every conceivable dear 
sacrifice to protect this accomplishment, he concluded.

  [Text] Presidential Council Vice Chairman 'Ali Salim al-Bid 
received in Aden today the brother members of the Political 
Forces Dialogue Committee, which continues its meetings in Aden, 
the economic and commercial capital of the country. 
  At the outset of the meeting, Presidential Council Vice 
Chairman brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid welcomed the committee 
members, appreciating their efforts to reach practical solutions 
to the current problems. He said that the good efforts being 
made by the Dialogue Committee, which includes several national 
figures whose national role and struggle experience are 
undeniable, need to be fostered and nurtured. Positive 
participation in the work of this committee is required to 
ensure the success of its efforts, he noted. 
  Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid affirmed that the Dialogue 
Committee must be supported if its efforts are to succeed. He 
hoped that the committee will achieve tangible results that 
would help overcome difficulties and meet the challenges facing 
the effort to build a modern national state. He maintained that 
this would also remove the obstacles along the road to democracy 
in our homeland. He asserted the importance of making concerted 
efforts to identify all that could enjoy the unanimous support 
of all Yemenis and their noble national forces. He also called 
for expanding participation in this committee's work, and also 
for demonstrating seriousness and patience. He said that this 
committee's work must bear fruit. 
  The Presidential Council vice chairman said that Yemen's 
strength lies in its unity, in implementing its cultural plan, 
and also in building a modern national state that would ensure a 
better future for its population. He said that Yemen has great 
capabilities and potentials at its disposal. We must be proud 
of these capabilities and potentials, and strive to use them to 
promote the development and construction endeavor, he added. 
  The Presidential Council vice chairman affirmed the 
importance of complying with the results of the dialogue, and 
with all the measures the committee might agree upon to enhance 
unity and foster democracy, as this would spare the country 
future difficulties as well as the dangers of violence and 
terrorism. He appealed to all noble national forces to unite 
themselves against violence and all other negative phenomena, 
which have begun to jeopardize the democratization process 
heralded by our country on 22 May 1990 and undermine the 
security and stability of both the homeland and citizens. He 
affirmed that the competent agencies must address security 
violations, ease the people's difficult living conditions, and 
halt price hikes as well as the declining exchange rate of the 
national currency. He noted that an atmosphere of trust and 
amity must be fostered, and that the negative painful legacy of 
the past must be forgotten. 
  In his remarks to the Dialogue Committee, brother 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid affirmed the need to expand the base of participation in 
the ongoing dialogue. He added that a new mechanism must be 
identified to promote this. Tangible measures must be seen, he 
noted. He went on to say that a single practical step is better 
than a host of decisions that remain ink on paper. He added: 
The best of us is he who provides solutions that would enjoy 
the people's support. 
  The brothers members of the Dialogue Committee and 
Presidential Council Vice Chairman brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid 
exchanged views on the current situation, as well as the ways 
and means of finding solutions to this situation. The Dialogue 
Committee members affirmed their eagerness to find solutions and 
genuine remedies to the current crisis in order to safeguard 
unity and democracy and build a modern national state.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Saddam Husayn on 5 January </F>
commemorating the 73d anniversary of the Iraqi Army; place not 
given -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
O great people, O stalwart men in our valiant Armed Forces, O 
glorious Arabs, O honest men and those have faith in justice and 
right wherever you may be: Greetings. On this blessed day, the 
6th of January, the anniversary of the birth and founding of 
Iraq's Army in modern times, important meaning and values 
glimmer here, and in the life of the nation and mankind every 
year. The first nucleus of Iraq's modern Army; the Musa 
al-Kazim Regiment was founded on 6 January 1921. On that date, 
the old colonialist powers, with Britain at their forefront, 
which used to control major parts of the world, exploited 
hundreds of millions of the sons of mankind, plundered their 
resources, and resorted to force and repression against those 
who called for freedom and justice. 
  A scientific comparison of the potentials of the poor and 
weak people of the world, including the people of Iraq, against 
the armies, fleets, aircraft, and other huge material potential 
of Britain and the other colonialist countries was not in favor 
of our people and others like us. Such a comparison may instill 
despair and result in capitulation to the will of the oppressive 
and colonialist tyrants. However, in spite of the difficult 
circumstances and the meager technical and material potential in 
general, the people of Iraq rebelled against these oppressive 
tyrants. Our people did all that they could do under those 
circumstances and affected the plans and the stands of the 
leaders of evil, achieving certain results on the road to 
freedom and independence, including the establishment of the 
nucleus of a national army, which is this great Army whose 
anniversary we celebrate today after 73 years. This Army stands 
loftily, crowned with pride, capability, and honesty. This is 
because the people's will is second to God's will; stronger than 
all circumstances and state of affairs. All that leads to a 
better life, therefore, stems from this will. 
  In those days, the stalwart Iraqis imposed their will on 
the colonialists by founding their national Army. Afterward, 
the sly colonialists and their stooges tried to make this Army a 
tool in their hands against the people and their national 
objectives of freedom and independence and against pan-Arab 
objectives and genuine faith, honesty, and loyalty. 
  However, the then budding Army, which now has great 
experience, is the righteous son of Iraq and the descendant of 
Iraq's great armies known by this land for more than 5,000 
years. This Army has disappointed their malicious hopes and 
remained the way the unyielding people of Iraq wanted it -- an 
Army for Iraq and the nation. As time went by, the Army became 
a bulwark for nationalism and pan-Arabism and a school for the 
brave men who advocate Arabism and champion Islam. 
  This was the history of the Army in the 1930's; in the 1941 
revolution; the revolution of 14 July 1958; the Ramadan 
revolution in 1963; and also under the leadership of the party 
of the people and the nation, the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, in 
the 17-30 July 1978 revolution. 
  This is the role played by our valiant Army in defending 
Iraq 
and Arabism against the racist anti-Arab expansion that came 
from the east for eight fierce years in successive epics of the 
glorious al-Qadisiyah. Finally, manifest victory was scored on 
the day of days, 8 August 1988. 
  This is its role, which is unprecedented in the history of 
mankind, in the immortal Mother of Battles, when it withstood 
the aggression of 28 armies and more than 30 states, including 
three super powers. There were other supporters who were among 
the people of a superpower that was a friend of the Arabs and 
Iraq until part of its leaders conspired against the great 
people of Iraq. 
  O brothers, O brave fighters, the elite of the nation's men 
and the slogan of its glory: 
  The deluded colonialists have tried for more than 70 years 
to 
strike at this Army and to turn it into a tool in their hands 
against the people, homeland, and the nation. Following the 
criminal aggression -- in which they used all manner of weapons 
of killing and destruction in their arsenals, including the 
banned weapons -- after launching large-scale propaganda 
campaigns full of lies and falsehood and on which they spent 
large amounts of money from the treasuries of the renegades who 
stole the wealth of the Arab nation; after the unjust blockade 
through which they aimed at starving the people; and after 
imposing the no-fly zones in the north and the south, those 
colonialists imagined that they could achieve today what they 
failed to achieve in the past. The lowly ones were 
disappointed. The Army of the nation, the brave and great Army 
of Iraq, which was a national and pan-Arab bastion throughout 
its glorious history, remained, even after the aggression, 
Iraq's lofty Arab bastion to defend dignity, sovereignty, 
independence, and the homeland. It also remained a school of 
sacrifices, giving, and creativity in the times of peace and 
construction as well as on the fields of combat. 
  O brothers, armies and nations, which exist on the same 
surface, live their values and follow basic criteria in terms of 
seriousness and nonseriousness toward principles and stands. 
And when a nation or an army retreats from its course and 
remains under the effect of this setback, not trying to stand 
up, the other party will follow suit. Whenever a nation rises 
up and holds on, the Army will also rise up and hold on. 
Anyhow, in this era of the history of nations, armies and 
nations exist on the same surface, see each other, and interact 
with each other. They live with a common conscience and 
historical sense. If any of them represent both at the 
beginning of a historical era in a situation like this, then, 
everybody will follow the party that represents all even if 
certain factors have placed one of them in the position of the 
initiator and the other in the position of a follower because it 
is burdened by responsibilities that prevent it from taking the 
lead position. 
  This is exactly how the relationship has been between our 
people and Army throughout history. If the people or the Army 
take a step forward on the road to historical achievement, and 
both are part of the nation's conscience, this step encourages 
the adoption of another one and both interact and form a great 
historical era. This relationship has been clearly embodied in 
the details and picture of what happened whether in Al-Qadisiyah 
battle, which our comrades have named Saddam's al-Qadisiyah, or 
in the Mother of Battles with all its arenas and chapters. 
  The people during al-Qadisiyah and the Mother of Battles 
have 
been the backbone of the Army, the secret of the great sense of 
national and pan-Arab affiliation, and the source of the 
conscience of history and the aspirations from which the Army 
gains its readiness for sacrifice and optimism for the future. 
The Army, with its ideological, psychological, and professional 
training has always been the people's support when ill winds sap 
the determination of some, or when the march does not equip them 
to complete the march. 
  We experienced circumstances in al-Qadisiyah during which 
the 
people took the initiative to give another chance to the Army to 
enable it to portray the image it wishes to portray. When the 
major fighting began in the glorious Mother of Battles, when the 
fighting intensified and pressures were brought to bear from all 
sides, and after the first chapter of the 30-state attack, when 
the action of the evildoers and the treacherous took place 
within the framework of the Iranian conspiracy that complemented 
the comprehensive aggression and when the chapters of the 
conspiracy, treachery, and treason intensified, some were shaken 
and feet slipped from the right course. The Army, and we mean 
the knights of the Armed Forces, those who have a principled 
historical stand and enjoy excellent values, have been those who 
entrenched the banners on lofty hills so that every eye would 
see the banner of God is great and so that this banner would 
announce to the four corners of the earth that right is here, 
that honor is here, that the present is here and the future 
passes through here, that capability and impregnability are 
here. May evil befall all the weak, and accursed be the 
treacherous, those who assist the foreigner. Nationalism and 
pan-Arabism are here. Woe to the foreigner when he crosses the 
borders and commits crimes. The sublime meanings are here. Long 
live Iraq and our glorious Arab nation. God is great. Long 
live Iraq. God is great. Long Live Palestine, free and Arab. 
Long live Palestine. 
  Brothers, by what we have said, we meant to tell our dear, 
valiant, and militant Army and our great, glorious people that 
sincere, principled, and historically perceptive leaders may 
commit mistakes as regards what should be done. Only God is 
infallible. Some may recall part of the mistakes in isolation 
from the circumstances of the comprehensive situation. They may 
think that it would be right to feel angry or imagine that it 
would be legitimate to react angrily. However, as long as 
leaders do not commit historic mistakes that will be regretted 
by the people or the Army, or the people and the Army together, 
God forbid, the traits and meaning of historic leadership will 
continue to be associated with them. If remorse affects the 
Army and the people in general--any people and army--then this 
means that a mark of disgrace has been recorded against them in 
that particular era. Thus, they will lose an historic 
opportunity to have a record of great honor. Despite all the 
injustice and humiliation that affected the great Iraqi people 
and valiant Armed Forces by the opponent's technical force and 
the broad enemy front, your leadership has not pushed you to 
remorse and disgrace. Most often, it has saved some from their 
own selves, having pulled falsehood from under their feet and 
supported their backs with right. 
  Brothers, these lessons are not only meant as a source of 
pride, but they lead to important conclusions in our daily 
struggle and steadfastness in the face of tyranny and the 
embargo imposed on our people and country. 
  The steadfastness of the Iraqi Army and the fact that it has 
maintained its defensive capabilities and bright national and 
pan-Arab traits is a prominent, shining aspect of the 
steadfastness of Iraq, in all its sectors and among its zealous 
sons, in the face of aggression, tyranny, malicious plots, false 
propaganda, and the embargo imposed by the forces of evil and 
darkness since 6 August 1990. 
  The Army of the people has maintained its steadfastness; the 
people of Iraq have also remained steadfast, in the face of all 
plots and wagers at a stage when U.S. tyranny is dominating the 
world in alliance with world Zionism. During this stage, many 
armies were humiliated. Also, many peoples and countries, some 
of them big, were disgraced. However, the enemies, before the 
friends, have acknowledged publicly and secretly that their 
wagers on Iraq, its Army, people, and leadership have failed 
utterly. May God disgrace them, make their sides bleed, and 
throw them in hell. 
  Zealous brothers and glorious sisters: Among the prominent 
facts about the outcome of the Mother of Battles and its 
continuation until this day in various forms and methods, we 
feel confident that steadfastness, adherence to the principles 
and values of freedom, justice and right, as expressed by the 
Mother of Battles in their highest meanings, and pursuing 
reconstruction and creativity, represent the right course. 
There is no other course to remove injustice, tyranny, the 
unjust embargo, and any weakness that besets the followers of 
God. 
  These lessons have so far, with God's help and blessings, 
facilitated Iraq's steadfastness and the capabilities to pursue 
reconstruction. They also ensure the necessary requirements for 
safeguarding our dear homeland, making it free, lofty, and 
capable of awakening and continued reconstruction and progress. 
  Brothers, honorable people of the world: We have always 
been inspired by our noble religion and the traditions of our 
Prophet Muhammad, God's peace and blessings be upon him. We 
have also been inspired by the noble principles of the Ba'th 
[Party]. We have always been advocates of peace and 
brotherliness, believing in right, justice, and equality and 
struggling for our rights and principles without encroaching on 
the rights of others. We in Iraq and as free Arabs in the Arab 
nation want to have in this world a respectable position, which 
we deserve due to what the Iraqis and Arabs have contributed to 
human civilization and to upholding the principles of right and 
justice throughout history. Today, the tyrants and the 
oppressors who are hold sway over the world's destiny cannot--no 
matter what they do--prevent the great people of Iraq from 
occupying the sublime status for which they are struggling, nor 
can they prevent the world nations from realizing their freedom, 
progress, and right to choose their way of life through their 
free, dignified will. 
  Glorious Iraqi men and women: A few days before the third 
anniversary of the 30-state aggression, we are confident that 
the wicked objectives the sought by the wicked ones before, 
during, and after the aggression are collapsing one after the 
other. The remaining chapters of aggression will also collapse 
the way many of them collapsed in the past, God willing. They 
will collapse with the determination of the zealous Iraqis and 
the support of the free people and faithful ones in the world. 
Regarding this issue, I would like to say that some rulers in 
the region--rulers who betrayed the trust, lost honor, plotted 
against Iraq, and took part in the sinister schemes against it 
and in aggression against its people--are still trying with all 
their means to maintain the embargo imposed on the Iraqi people. 
They are spending what has remained of the funds to this end. 
They are also supporting the illegal interests of those laying 
traps and the polytheists at the expense of the wealth of their 
peoples and the poor sons of the nation. They are paying bribes 
here and there to stop the growing trend that is calling for the 
lifting of the unjust embargo imposed on the Iraqi people. May 
God disgrace and uncover them. 
  Those who lost their honor, independence, and money to fund 
the intrigues against Iraq will lose more of what has remained 
with them of the money of the poor. They will waste the wealth 
of their peoples and nation. However, they will not be able to 
harm Iraq's steadfastness and ability to forge its way ahead 
over the debris of the wall of the blockade and injustice, 
protected by the banner of God is great, which has been 
maintained by the most gracious, most compassionate. Those who 
are wallowing in treason and are blinded by evil imagine that 
lifting the embargo imposed on Iraq is a wicked political game 
or a dirty diplomacy that can be obstructed by illegal payments 
and bribes. They do not know that the basic reason that will 
lead to the ending of the blockade is the steadfastness of Iraq 
and the Iraqis, their adherence to faith in their principles and 
their rights, their clinging to honor and virtue, and their 
loyalty to their noble nationalist, pan-Arab, and human 
objectives. These bases, which cannot be shaken or changed by 
funds, evil intrigues, or the meanness of the wicked ones, are 
the Iraqis' ammunition in facing the embargo and their path 
toward ending it and any ordeal. 
  Dear Iraqis, brave men of our national valiant Armed Forces, 
the Army of July 1958, Ramadan 1963, July 1968, al-Qadisiyah, 
and Mother of Battles: In this new year, like the previous 
years, we are looking forward to more work, training, vigilance, 
efficiency, and more creativeness and innovation of methods, 
through which we will defeat the enemy of both God and you. 
Through such methods, we will defeat the unjust blockade, hold 
fast in the face of the arrogant ones and henchmen, and prove to 
the enemies that their blockade is useless, that their intrigues 
will be defeated, and that the values and rights of our nation 
and people are well protected and that God is their protector 
and defender. 
  Greetings of love and pride. Peace be upon our victorious 
Army, the descendent of the great armies of Iraq and the holder 
of the banner of Arabism and the message of good, justice, and 
right. Peace be upon the Army of Iraq, the Army of the Arab 
nation. Peace be upon the martyrs. Peace be upon the martyrs. 
Peace be upon Palestine. Peace be upon every Arab who has 
rejected and rejects wrongdoing. Peace be upon everyone of you 
and your families. May God preserve you and protect you. God 
is great. Accursed be the lowly.

  [Text] Kuwait, 6 Jan (KUNA) -- AL-WATAN newspaper today 
reported that Iraqi President Saddam Husayn has committed a new 
massacre against leaders from the Ba'th party who broke away 
from him years ago and sought refuge in Damascus. 
  The paper pointed out that Iraqi intelligence prepared a 
plan 
to lure a number of Iraqi opposition leaders living in Syria to 
the Kurdish area and from there to Mosul, where they were left 
to contact active elements of the [Iraqi] opposition; then they 
were arrested. The paper added that the plan succeeded and that 
death sentences were carried out on at least 10, including 
Muhamad al-Tai, who was described as a member of the dissident 
Iraqi regional command. 
  Sources of the dissident Iraqi regional command leadership 
in 
Damascus remained silent, but AL-WATAN paper reported these 
sources as saying that al-Tai acted individually and without 
orders from the leadership. 
  The paper said it was announced in Mosul that the bodies of 
five victims have been received, and that the rest are believed 
to have been killed during interrogation.

<F P=106> ['Adnan Husayn report: "Confirmation of the First </F>
Resignation From the `Government' of Iraqi Kurdistan; the 
Parties of Barzani and Talabani Coordinate Their Ways of Dealing 
With the Islamic Movement"] 
  [Excerpts] London -- AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that a 
minister in the regional "government" formed by the Iraqi Kurds 
about a year and a half ago in the northern areas not under the 
control of the Iraqi Government resigned last month in protest 
against what he described as "violations" and "excesses" in the 
government administration. 
  According to the sources of these reports, Culture Minister 
Shirku Biks (50 years old), considered one of the most prominent 
Kurdish poets at present, justified the resignation he submitted 
on 11 December by saying that "he did not wish to bear the 
historical responsibility, before the people, for the violations 
taking place in the government administration, the daily 
excesses, the intertwined ministerial powers, and other problems 
of government administration." 
  Biks does not belong to any Kurdish party but he was a 
candidate on the list of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] 
led by Jalal Talabani in the local parliamentary elections held 
in Iraqi Kurdistan in May 1992. [passage omitted] 
  According to PUK sources, the Kurdish minister's resignation 
was mainly due to his dissatisfaction with a number of measures 
taken by the regional government including the closure of the 
local paper WALAT by an administrative and not judicial decision 
and without legal grounds. That paper was published by some 
Iraqi Kurds and was known for its support for the Kurdish 
Workers Party [PKK] of Turkey which has waged a guerrilla war 
against Turkey and which calls for an independent Kurdish state. 
[passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, PUK sources have stated that the meeting held 
between the leaders of two main parties in Iraqi Kurdistan [the 
PUK and the Kurdistan Democratic Party] last Sunday ended in 
agreement to cooperate to "solve the problems" resulting from 
the recent fighting between the Islamic Movement of Iraqi 
Kurdistan and the PUK. They added that the two sides agreed on 
a "framework for dealing with and cooperating with the movement 
on the basis of commitment to the local laws, and no armed 
presence." 
  In another development, a responsible source of the Iraqi 
opposition's Democratic National Accord Grouping has denied that 
there was a recent split in his organization. He said that late 
last month the Executive Committee held meetings "during which 
it accepted the resignation of 'Abd-al-Karim al-Mashhadani, 
taking into consideration his family circumstances, and 
terminated the memberships of Usamah Mahdi and Munaf Hasan for 
refusing to comply with the decisions made during the meetings 
in connection with political, organizational, and administrative 
matters." These three had issued a statement the day before 
yesterday saying that they resigned in protest against 
"ideological, organizational, and administrative violations."

<F P=106> ['Adnan Husayn report: "Islamic Movement Confirms Resumption </F>
of Fighting in Iraqi Kurdistan"] 
  [Excerpts] London -- The Islamic Movement [IM] in Iraqi 
Kurdistan has announced that it has resumed its armed operations 
against the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK] which is led by 
Jalal Talabani and which shares power with the Kurdistan 
Democratic Party [KDP] led by Mas'ud Barzani in the Kurdish 
areas not under the Iraqi Government's control. 
  A spokesman for IM in London told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT 
yesterday 
that "over the past two days, a large IM force occupied the 
mountain range of Ahmad Awah" overlooking the road between the 
towns of al-Sulaymaniyah and Halabjah near the borders with Iran. 
  He added that the villages of "Balkhah, Ahmad Awah, Byara, 
and Tawilah are now under the control of IM forces" and that the 
IM forces "have killed or wounded no less than 15 PUK members 
and taken prisoner 25 others." 
  PUK sources denied that, but said that "limited fighting" 
took place the day before yesterday near the village of Tawilah 
on the border with Iran. They added that "remnants of the IM 
along with some members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard 
attacked the village but were immediately driven out of it." 
  According to the same sources, the "IM remnants are trying 
to 
regroup inside Iranian territory with the help of the Iranian 
Revolutionary Guard." [passage omitted] 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Dr. Barham Salih, 
member 
of the PUK and "Kurdistan region government" representative in 
Washington, said that his party "which was compelled to fight 
the IM" did not wish to end the IM "as a political 
oraganization.... We just want it to comply with the decisions 
and laws of the (Kurdish) parliament and government, and to 
operate in accordance with the law organizing freedom of 
partisan action in Kurdistan, which prohibits the presence of 
armed party militias outside the framework of the unified 
Kurdistan army."

  [Text] Irbil, Iraq, Jan 5 (AFP)--The trial opened here 
Wednesday [5 January] of a Turkish guide accused of murdering 
three BBC freelancers in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq, an 
AFP correspondent reported. 
  Hashim Jirki is accused of killing Charles Maxwell, Nick 
della Casa and his wife Rossana as he took them across the 
Turkish-Iraq border during the Kurdish uprising in northern Iraq 
in March 1991. 
  The bodies of the two men were found close to the border six 
months later, but the woman has never been found. 
  Kurdish police arrested Jirki in spring of last year, and he 
allegedly confessed to the killings, saying the three had not 
given him enough money. 
  He has spent 10 months in prison in Irbil, where the 
breakaway Kurdish parliament is based. 
  Kurdish police said it had taken until now to complete their 
investigations, and they had been in contact with their Turkish 
counterparts. 
  Trial judge 'Iz-al-Din told AFP that the verdict will be 
given on Saturday. 
  The three British journalists had planned to slip across the 
mountainous border to report on the Kurdish uprising against 
President Saddam Husayn following the Gulf war. 
  They left the Turkish border town of Yuksekova and were 
never 
seen again. 
  The mystery remained for more than a year, despite efforts 
by 
the BBC and Rossana della Casa's mother, who visited the region 
several times and is a member of a delegation accompanying 
Britain's Lord Archer on a current trip here. 
  It was suspected by other journalists and also by Kurdish 
authorities that the three had either been killed by the Turkish 
or Iraqi military. 
  However, Jirki surrendered to the Kurdish police and 
confessed last year. 
  Lord Archer, better known as the author Jeffrey Archer, 
addressed the Kurdish parliament on Wednesday and delivered a 
message from Prime Minister John Major. 
  Major expressed his satisfaction "to be able to pass those 
greetings through the elected representatives of the people of 
Iraq." 
  He said his meeting last March with leaders of the 
opposition 
Iraqi National Congress "strengthened my hope that this 
democratic model will one day be followed by other parts of Iraq 
if that is the wish of the Iraqi people." 
  He also confirmed that British aircraft will remain at least 
another six months in Turkey to protect northern Iraq. 
  Lord Archer arrived here on Tuesday for a five-day visit.

  [Text] Baghdad, Jan 5 (INA) -- An Iraqi political analyst 
predicted peaceful trends in the Arab region during the current 
year resulting from feelings of fatigue caused by international 
conflicts that had engulfed the region over the past years. 
  The analyst, Mr. Barzan al-Tikriti said in an article 
published by AL-JUMHURIYAH newspaper today that such kind of 
peace could be achieved if bravery was available with those 
decision-making people to wrap up chapter of the past and start 
a new chapter through serious and realistic debate of affairs 
and realities despite their bitterness to reach a new and sound 
frame that clarifies the nature of relationship and obligations. 
  The Iraqi analyst warned against the probabilities in case 
of 
non-availability of good intentions and the bravery for 
realizing a settlement of leading to dangerous developments that 
cause blood and destruction. 
  Mr. al-Tikriti believes that inter-actions of 1994 will be 
governed by the quality of the relationship between two courses. 
First of them is the feeling of fatigue from the conflict and 
the second is an increased move toward regionalism especially in 
the Arab region as a result to previous events and mainly to the 
events in the Arab Peninsula and Gulf. 
  The Iraqi analyst justified the Zionist-Palestinian 
self-rule 
agreement to the feeling of fatigue of the conflict parties and 
said that that feeling could be the reason behind the 
probability of achieving peace in Ireland and other hot-beds in 
the world. 
  Mr. al-Tikriti further predicted an end to other conflicts 
in 
other parts of the word like Afghanistan. Former Yugoslavia, 
Somalia, Yemen in addition to the conclusion of peace agreements 
by concerned Arab countries with Israel. 
  The analyst was of the view that all those issues would be 
liable for settlement because of the weight of pressure of 
fatigue from conflict unless a decisive factor could be 
introduced in those conflicts and differences and namely the 
motive of regionalism. 
  Mr. al-Takriti ruled out the possibility that the Arab 
homeland could witness a real attempt for unification neither in 
general nor on the level of regional entities and that there are 
increased fears over the possibility of maintaining Iraq as 
integral entity. 
  The analyst replied on such fears by saying that Iraq would 
remain unified for reasons including that what could be applied 
on Iraq is applied on countries of the region unless those 
countries would accept what the others decide for them or were 
not knowing what is going around them or within their borders. 
  The Iraqi analyst further predicted an escalation to the 
extreme fundamentalist trend in the Arab region in the manner 
that threatens of changes in the Arab Peninsula and the Gulf 
states, Egypt and other Arab countries.

  [Text] Well-informed Israeli sources attribute great 
importance to a statement made by a Radio Damascus commentator 
that in exchange for a withdrawal from all the occupied 
territories, Israel will reap the fruits of peace on all fronts, 
without exception. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz 
reports that according to these sources, this is the first 
statement of its kind. They believe it was made in anticipation 
of the Clinton-al-Asad summit.

  [Text] The Taba talks will resume next week since Israel 
and the PLO have bridged most of the gaps in their positions. 
Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz is in the studio with 
the details: 
  Several words separate Israel and the PLO and are holding up 
the official announcement on the resumption of the Taba talks. 
Most of the work has, in fact, already been done and has 
enabled official political sources in Jerusalem to say today 
that the deliberations will be renewed next week, and only the 
day still has to be decided. The telephone dialogue between 
Shim'on Peres and Nabil Sha'th has so far led to the following 
outcome: The Taba talks will discuss the Cairo understandings 
and the Declaration of Principles. 
  The PLO is pleased because it refers to understandings and 
no 
longer talks about the Cairo agreement or document. Israel is 
satisfied because it is based on the Cairo Liaison Committee and 
not on the Oslo or Versailles talks, as demanded by the PLO. 
Israel is also pleased about something else; Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin said several times recently that Yasir 'Arafat's 
recent demands are deviations from the Oslo documents. The 
contacts are due to continue this evening. Foreign Minister 
Peres is due to talk on the telephone again with Nabil Sha'th. 
Peres also spoke with 'Arafat's special adviser Dr. Ahmad 
al-Tibi several times today. 
  Correspondent Ya'aqov Balsenboim reports on Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin's visit to the Meqorot company today: 
  [Begin recording] [Balsenboim] Rabin was the guest of the 
Meqorot company which inaugurated Jerusalem's fourth water 
pipeline, but he could not avoid journalists' questions about 
the crisis in the peace talks. The first question put to him 
was when would the Taba talks resume: 
  [Rabin] I hope that they will be resumed when a suitable 
basis is found, if there is agreement on what was achieved in 
Cairo. If there is no agreement then everything is open. 
  [Balsenboim] The prime minister added that if the Cairo 
agreement is not approved by Tunis then we are also not bound by 
what was agreed upon. 
  [Rabin] It is true that it was known beforehand that any 
agreement reached in Cairo depends on the approval of the 
leaderships in Tunis and Jerusalem. No approval was apparently 
received in Tunis for some of the things achieved in Cairo. If 
this is the case, then from our standpoint, things said in Cairo 
do not have to be approved by us. 
  [Balsenboim] Asked about a possible meeting with 'Arafat, 
Rabin said it is more important to reach agreement on the 
Gaza-Jericho First agreement. 
  [Rabin] I do not think that at this stage such a meeting is 
the issue. The aim is to find real answers to permit us to 
implement the commitment to the Declaration of Principles, to 
translate it into a detailed Gaza-Jericho First agreement. 
Implementation will not start before we reach such an agreement. 
  [Balsenboim] To conclude, Rabin added that independent 
contributions by ministers and Knesset members to the 
negotiations are superfluous. 
  [Rabin] I think that at this stage, it is preferable to 
leave the negotiations to those who have to handle them and 
independent contributions are superfluous. [end recording]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres says that if the 
Palestinians will want to discuss the editorial and stylistic 
aspects of the Cairo understandings in Taba, Israel will not 
object. As far as the contents are concerned, Peres said the 
Cairo understandings will serve as the basis for the 
continuation of the Taba talks. Minister Peres told our 
political correspondent Udi Segal that the Palestinians have 
learned that Israel is serious when it says it will not 
compromise on security issues and that this is not merely a 
matter of tactics and bargaining. The foreign minister said 
that the contacts between Nabil Sha'th and himself lasted for 
several days because Israel wanted to make it clear to the 
Palestinians that it is acting cautiously and is not pressed for 
time. Our political correspondent notes that Israel wants the 
Taba talks to go on continuously in order to attain quick 
progress. 
  A short time ago, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin also 
commented 
on the resumption of the Taba talks next week. According to 
Rabin the negotiations, which will be based on the Cairo 
understandings, are aimed at attaining a detailed agreement on 
Gaza and Jericho. This morning, Rabin visited the settlement of 
Na'ama where he met the local residents. Our correspondent in 
the territories Golan Yokhpaz brought this report from the 
Allenby Bridge border crossing: 
  [Begin recording] [Yokhpaz] A short time ago, Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, who is visiting this crossing point, 
said that the Taba talks will be based mainly on the 
understandings reached by Israel and the Palestinians in Cairo. 
The prime minister arrived here accompanied by Chief of Staff 
Ehud Baraq and, together with other IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
officers, they visited the settlement of Na'ama in the Jordan 
Valley. Local settlers have claimed that in the framework of 
the Jericho autonomy plan, their settlement will turn into an 
enclave within the Jericho area. 
  Rabin told the settlers that Israel considers the Jordan 
Valley a security zone because of the area's importance for the 
country's security. This is what Rabin said regarding the 
resumption of the Taba talks next week: 
  [Rabin] In Taba we want to reach a detailed, clear, and 
lucid agreement. In everything relating to Gaza-Jericho First, 
the talks will be based on the Cairo understandings. If they 
backtrack.... [pauses] Everything we said hinges on compliance 
with all the components of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement. 
[end recording] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0900 GMT on 6 January 
adds: "Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says that there is no 
territorial controversy or security problems between Israel and 
Jordan, but Amman is unwilling to be the first party to sign a 
peace treaty with Israel. During his visit to Na'ama and the 
Allenby Bridge, the prime minister also said he is opposed to 
discussing the permanent agreement at this point, not only 
because of our commitment to the Madrid conference but also 
because he is opposed to uprooting settlements and to 
negotiations on the issue of Jerusalem. Our settlement affairs 
correspondent Gil Litman reports that the prime minister told 
Na'ama settlers that he understands their grievances, but Israel 
is interested in solving the conflict with the Palestinians."]

  [Text] Police Minister Moshe Shahal says the most 
important issue to be discussed at the Taba talks next week will 
be the relationship between the Israeli security forces and the 
Palestinian police. 
  Minister Shahal, addressing the Israeli Association for 
Industrial Security this morning, said the agreement between 
Israel and Jordan is finalized and there is absolutely no 
controversy between the two countries on any issue. Shahal 
expressed the opinion that King Husayn is waiting for the right 
time to announce the signing of a peace treaty with Israel, and 
this could happen after the Clinton-al-Asad meeting. 
  Our correspondent Shim'on Vilna'i adds that Minister Shahal 
denounced the planting of the bombs near the Peace Now offices 
in New York. He said the police will strive to uncover elements 
such as those who have tried to smuggle arms into Israel.

have presented a no-confidence motion to the government 
following a statement by Agriculture Minister Ya'aqov Tzur that 
after the five-year interim period of Palestinian self-rule, a 
Palestinian state could be established in the territories. The 
two parties say Tzur's comments contradict statements Prime 
Minister Rabin made in the Knesset.

  [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin said the Arab 
economic boycott is becoming void and even the Arab states are 
changing their attitude toward it. Arab businessmen are 
visiting Israel to investigate the possibility of investing 
here. Four Arab states -- Oman, Qatar, Tunisia, and Morocco -- 
have expressed a willingness to host the economic committees in 
the multilateral negotiations. There is a readiness by 
multinational companies, which had previously caved in to the 
boycott, to invest in Israel. Even in Japan -- the largest state 
to support the boycott -- there has been a revolutionary change 
and Japanese businessmen and companies plan to invest in Israel. 
He said, however, that he still finds it hard to foresee an 
Arab League decision to annul the boycott. Our correspondent 
Yo'el Nir reports that Deputy Foreign Minister Beilin made the 
remarks in answer to a motion in the Knesset.

<F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] </F>
  [Excerpts] Major General Yitzhaq Mordekhay, commander of 
the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Northern Command, said yesterday 
that he believes the terrorists will try to step up their 
attacks in southern Lebanon in anticipation of the 
Clinton-al-Asad summit in Geneva on 16 January. 
  According to Maj. Gen. Mordekhay, before such summits there 
is always an escalation in Hizballah activities and attempts to 
cause unrest in the area. 
  Senior military sources in the Northern Command assessed 
that 
the rejectionist front organizations will also attempt to step 
up attacks against the IDF and SLA [South Lebanese Army] in the 
security zone in the week ahead. The IDF is consequently 
raising its level of alert in southern Lebanon. [passage 
omitted] 
  According to Maj. Gen. Mordekhay, Syria must curb the terror 
activity: "Just as Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has said, Syria 
wields the decisive influence over Hizballah. The most 
important thing the prime minister and the chief of staff have 
said is that if Syria makes a real effort, it can curtail 
terrorism along our northern border." [passage omitted] 
  According to Gen. Mordekhay, Hizballah has started firing 
from villages north of the security zone over the past few 
weeks, in violation of the understandings reached in the wake of 
Operation Accountability. 
  According to Mordekhay, "during 1993, 124 terrorists were 
killed and dozens of others were wounded, Operation 
Accountability included. Our forces in the north are attaining 
their objectives. I believe the northern border settlements 
enjoy a high level of security thanks to IDF activity in the 
security zone and along the international border."

  [Text] Ankara -- It has been learned that the Syrian 
authorities have rejected a request from Jalal Talabani, leader 
of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK], and Kemal Burkay, 
secretary general of the Kurdistan Socialist Party [PSK], for a 
meeting with the leader of the PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] 
Abdullah Ocalan. 
  According to the available information, Talabani and Burkay 
went to the Syrian capital Damascus last week to meet Ocalan. 
It was said that Talabani and Burkay were going to propose to 
Ocalan to declare a cease-fire on the eve of the local elections 
[in Turkey]. Syria's refusal to allow the meeting to take place 
opened the way to some speculation. 
  PUK's representative in Ankara confirmed that Talabani went 
to Syria last week and stayed there for "a very brief period." 
The representative said that he has no information as to 
whether a meeting was held with Apo [alias for Abdullah Ocalan]. 
  It has been learned that PUK leader Jalal Talabani has now 
gone to Saudi Arabia from Syria. It was reported that Saudi 
Arabia has extended an official invitation to Talabani. The 
meeting with Talabani was interpreted as Saudi Arabia assuming 
an active interest in the Kurdish problem. 
  It has also been learned that Semdin Sakik, PKK's Amed [area 
covering Diyarbakir, Bingol, and Mus] provincial commander, has 
resigned from his post and left for Germany. It was reported 
that Sakik, who had kidney problems, resigned his position 
voluntarily and that a new commander has been "appointed" for 
Amed. The PKK circles ascribe reports of "differences" between 
Sakik and Ocalan to the "psychological warfare" being waged by 
the state.

  [Text] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali today 
received in his office the United Kingdom's Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd. They discussed relations between the two friendly 
countries and ways to bolster them in all fields. They also 
exchanged views on recent developments in the peace process. 
Dr. al-Majali explained Jordan's firm stand and commitment to 
both the bilateral and multilateral levels of the peace process 
-- a commitment based on the resolutions of international 
legitimacy until just, comprehensive, and lasting peace is 
achieved in the region. He also praised the United Kingdom's 
efforts in this regard. 
  For his part, Hurd praised His Majesty King Husayn's efforts 
to achieve peace, stressing the importance of the role played by 
Jordan in its capacity as a factor of security and stability in 
the region. 
  The meeting was attended by Talal al-Hasan, minister of 
state 
for foreign affairs; the Jordanian ambassador in London; the 
British ambassador in Amman; and the delegation accompanying the 
guest secretary. 
  Moreover, the Jordanian and British sides today held talks 
at 
the Ministry of Water and Irrigation dealing with the water 
situation in Jordan. The Jordanian side was attended by Dr. 
Hisham al-Khatib, minister of water and irrigation, while the 
British side was headed by Douglas Hurd, the British foreign 
secretary. 
  Dr. al-Khatib said the talks focused on Jordan's water 
situation and the talks on water issues which Jordan held within 
the peace process, whether on the bilateral or multilateral 
levels. He added that talks also covered relations between the 
two friendly countries in all fields, especially British 
technical aid to Jordan in order to exploit the waters of Qa' 
Disah in southern Jordan and to transfer these waters for use in 
northern Jordan. 
  The minister noted that EC countries, especially Britain, 
are 
aware that Jordan is suffering an acute shortage of water due to 
natural factors and because it is not receiving its fair share 
of the waters from the al-Yarmuk and Jordan Rivers. This was 
confirmed by all international studies in this field.

  [Text] Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department, 
made the following statement to our correspondent upon his 
arrival in Amman this morning: 
  [Begin recording] [Qaddumi] First comes coordination. We are 
one people and one country. In fact, coordination and 
cooperation are a must. We should explore the future and how 
the situation will be in the Middle East. The Jordanians and 
the Palestinians are one people and have common interests. The 
aim is to organize these common interests in the future, to draw 
up rules for them, and to reinforce the brotherly ties between 
us. The previous experiences we have faced as one unit cannot 
be seen as just a relationship between one country and another, 
but as one among the members of one family. This is our concept 
of the work for which we have come and for the future we want to 
work out together, God willing. 
  [Reporter] There is a crisis in Jordanian-Palestinian 
relations. What are the dimensions of this crisis? 
  [Qaddumi] There is no crisis. This is, regrettably, the 
creation of Arab or non-Arab media. There is, in fact, a 
persisting desire to carry out joint action because we are 
moving toward a serious stage. This esplains his majesty's 
statement that stressed desire to base relations on sound 
foundations. This, in fact, is our opinion and our trend. 
Therefore, what is being portrayed as a crisis is not a crisis 
at all. There is not crisis among the members of one family.

imposed by circumstances, geographical borders, demographic 
factors, and common destiny. 
  He added that there is complete agreement over principles 
and 
goals between the Jordanian and Palestinian delegations, 
explaining that today's talks dealt with the policies through 
which these principles are translated into reality. He also

Dr. Jawad al-'Anani said the talks were open and candid, but 
that tangible results have yet to be achieved. 
  [Begin recording] [Al-'Anani] Well, I think that the 
meetings 
were very open, very candid. They dealt with down-to-earth 
issues. It was very much businesslike. We have agreed that we 
agree on the basic principles and the guiding aims for our 
internal dialogue. However, we feel that this is necessary but 
not sufficient. What is sufficient is to arrive at tangible and 
practical steps that people can feel, make a difference of their 
own lives. And we assure them that the process of negotiations 
is going to ensure their own concerns. 
  [Reporter] Dr. al-'Anani: Do you think that the king's last 
speech has put a lot more pressure on the PLO to deal with the 
issues that are still in the air with the Palestinians and 
Jordanians? 
  [Al-'Anani] I do not need to analyze his majesty's motives. 
I think that the speech of his majesty was very clear, very 
candid. He was showing a great deal of concern that we need more 
coordination, and this coordination is not only a Jordanian 
demand, but it is a Jordanian as well as a Palestinian demand. 
  [Reporter] When do you expect the signing? 
  [Al-'Anani] We expect that we should continue to negotiate.

  [Text] The Higher Jordanian-Palestinian Joint Committee 
has concluded its second round of talks at the Foreign Ministry. 
Details are in the following report by our political affairs 
correspondent: 
  The Higher Jordanian-Palestinian Joint Committee this 
evening 
concluded its second round of talks at the Foreign Ministry. In 
statements to reporters, Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of 
information and minister of state for cabinet affairs, said: 
  [Begin recording] [al-'Anani] In fact, our talks were very 
serious and candid. The issues were discussed in detail in 
order to arrive at tangible, practical, and implementable steps 
that people can feel. Therefore, at this stage, we will meet 
again tomorrow morning and perhaps tomorrow afternoon and even 
on Friday morning so that we can arrive at decisive results, 
because this is the purpose of these talks at this level. We 
are also taking into consideration that people are awaiting 
tangible results, which require very serious and clear talks 
that define the frameworks and practical steps. We both agreed 
that if we do not arrive at such results, then we will not have 
met the people's expectations. 
  [Reporter] So, Mr. Abu-Ahmad [al-'Anani], are there any 
pending issues between the two sides? 
  [Al-'Anani] We are discussing all issues that are of 
importance to both sides, especially at this stage. 
  [Reporter] Did the discussions focus on specific issues? 
  [Al-'Anani] Of course, we discussed many basic issues, 
including economic and banking issues, issues that deal with the 
negotiations on water, evacuees, and refugees, the Jerusalem 
issue, as well as the need to coordinate stands on these issues 
and others that deal with the transitional phase and what is 
currently being negotiated in this regard to serve the two 
parties' interests. We, of course, have joint interests and 
what harms the Palestinians harms us and what benefits our 
brothers and kinfolk in the West Bank and Gaza Strip benefits us 
here in Jordan. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Analysis" by JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>
  [Text] Amman -- Jordan's ultimatum to the Palestine 
Liberation Organisation (PLO) this week was a last-ditch attempt 
to bring back the concept of comprehensiveness to the 
Arab-Israeli negotiations, analysts and observers believe. 
  In his address Tuesday [4 January] to senior officers from 
the Public Security General Intelligence and Civil Defence 
departments, His Majesty King Husayn expressed his "hope (that) 
we will reach a comprehensive peace with the help of all 
parties." 
  Jordanian officials privately say that the Kingdom was 
worried that the lack of coordination among the Arab parties to 
Middle East peace negotiations was leading to the disintegration 
of the concept of comprehensiveness, on which these negotiations 
were initially based, allowing Israel a chance to divide and 
rule. 
  According to those officials, the Kingdom has come under 
Syrian pressure to drop attempts to bring the PLO back into Arab 
coordination ranks and work instead towards 
Syrian-Jordanian-Lebanese coordination without the Palestinians. 
  In view of the fact that the "separate Oslo accord" is going 
nowhere, the message from Syria was that the upcoming summit 
meeting in Geneva between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and 
U.S. President Bill Clinton could be the the right opportunity 
for the three countries to show PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat that 
they have the upper hand. 
  But the question, according to officials and analysts, was 
whether Jordan would join such a coalition and give up on 
attempts to convince the PLO to coordinate with the Kingdom. 
  Analysts believe that this development placed Jordan in a 
difficult position since Mr. 'Arafat had been continually 
procrastinating over sending his aides to Amman to attend 
coordination committee talks scheduled to have started last June 
but which never did. 
  This sentiment was actually expressed by Minister of 
Information Jawad al-'Anani this week when he said Jordan feared 
that the lack of Jordanian-Palestinian coordination would force 
the country "to react in a way that is not in line with its 
overall policy." 
  To drop the idea of a comprehensive settlement and allow 
different Arab parties to reach separate peace accords with 
Israel would have defied Jordan's policy of waiting until all 
tracks have concluded their negotiations with Israel 
successfully before signing accords simultaneously. 
  Since Jordanians feel almost certain that President al-'Asad 
will get something from his meeting with President Clinton on 
Jan. 16, they felt that they were running out of time in 
bringing Arab parties to the talks to coordinate their steps and 
exchange information on developments on their tracks. 
  Senior Jordanian officials are constructing scenarios for 
progress on the Syrian front. They believe that while Syria is 
not expected to give in on its declared intention to accept full 
withdrawal, it may accept a time-tabled agenda leading to that 
conclusion if it receives American assurances that would 
guarantee its economic and security interests. 
  If this turns out to be true, one seasoned analyst said, 
Syria might be seen to be willing to give up its Arab leadership 
role if the Americans can station American or international 
troops on the border, maintain Syrian interests in Lebanon and 
allow Damascus to reap economic benefits of peace. 
  But Jordan also believes that if this happens without 
achieving tangible progress on the Palestinian front, there will 
be the risk of Arab-Israeli negotiations running into two 
separate "courses" -- Syrian-Lebanese-Israeli and 
Palestinian-Jordanian-Israeli -- instead of the four streamlined 
tracks. 
  The Jordanians fear that such a scenario, if it actually 
develops, will further weaken the Arab position and give Israel 
the opportunity to "hunt down" each Arab party individually. 
  This fear was also expressed by Dr. al-'Anani when he told a 
group of journalists earlier this week that the Kingdom feared 
ending up "with separate courses rather than tracks." 
  And while Dr. al-'Anani was willing to concede that these 
separate courses are historically present because of common 
interests, he feared that lack of coordination among the 
Jordanians and Palestinians would create inertia by making (the 
parties) rivals and competitive in dealing with Israel at the 
expense of each other. 
  In a statement he made Tuesday, Syrian Vice President 
'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam referred to the comprehensiveness of the 
negotiations by saying "the concept of comprehensiveness cannot 
be ignored (and has to come) in coordination with Lebanon and 
Jordan." 
  Mr. Khaddam did not mention the PLO as part of the 
comprehensive solution but criticised it for signing the 
declaration of principles (DoP) and predicted that "Israel would 
emerge the winner" as a result of this move. 
  The Syrians did not hide their displeasure with Jordan over 
the latter's agenda agreement with Israel, which was signed in 
Washington on Sept. 14, not only because they might have thought 
it was a prelude to reaching a separate peace treaty with the 
Jewish state, but also because it gave a diplomatic and 
political cover for the Sept. 13 agreement between the PLO and 
Israel. 
  Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar', at the time, issued 
what was seen as a warning to Jordan, but the issue was diffused 
soon afterwards when King Husayn visited President al-Asad in 
Damascus and reportedly assured him that Amman would not go it 
alone despite all the pressures it faced from the Americans and 
Israelis. 
  Officials and analysts here believe that Jordan cannot forge 
coordination with Syria and that this was made clear in His 
Majesty's statement Tuesday when he said that he had spoken 
about coordination with Syria, Lebanon and Egypt. "We have 
proven our commitment to work together. No one should believe 
that we will go it alone in this regard." 
  But while the Kingdom is committed to coordination with 
Syria, politicians agree that Jordan could not respond 
positively to dropping the PLO from coordination efforts because 
"it is a complicated and intricate relationship." 
  The King's virtual ultimatum to the PLO, while indicative of 
"tension" in relations between the two leaderships, can and 
should "serve interests of both Jordan and the PLO without 
hurting relations with Syria," one official said.

  [Text] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali today 
received in his office the United Kingdom's Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd. They discussed relations between the two friendly 
countries and ways to bolster them in all fields. They also 
exchanged views on recent developments in the peace process. 
Dr. al-Majali explained Jordan's firm stand and commitment to 
both the bilateral and multilateral levels of the peace process 
-- a commitment based on the resolutions of international 
legitimacy until just, comprehensive, and lasting peace is 
achieved in the region. He also praised the United Kingdom's 
efforts in this regard. 
  For his part, Hurd praised His Majesty King Husayn's efforts 
to achieve peace, stressing the importance of the role played by 
Jordan in its capacity as a factor of security and stability in 
the region. 
  The meeting was attended by Talal al-Hasan, minister of 
state 
for foreign affairs; the Jordanian ambassador in London; the 
British ambassador in Amman; and the delegation accompanying the 
guest secretary. 
  Moreover, the Jordanian and British sides today held talks 
at 
the Ministry of Water and Irrigation dealing with the water 
situation in Jordan. The Jordanian side was attended by Dr. 
Hisham al-Khatib, minister of water and irrigation, while the 
British side was headed by Douglas Hurd, the British foreign 
secretary. 
  Dr. al-Khatib said the talks focused on Jordan's water 
situation and the talks on water issues which Jordan held within 
the peace process, whether on the bilateral or multilateral 
levels. He added that talks also covered relations between the 
two friendly countries in all fields, especially British 
technical aid to Jordan in order to exploit the waters of Qa' 
Disah in southern Jordan and to transfer these waters for use in 
northern Jordan. 
  The minister noted that EC countries, especially Britain, 
are 
aware that Jordan is suffering an acute shortage of water due to 
natural factors and because it is not receiving its fair share 
of the waters from the al-Yarmuk and Jordan Rivers. This was 
confirmed by all international studies in this field.

  [Text] Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department, 
made the following statement to our correspondent upon his 
arrival in Amman this morning: 
  [Begin recording] [Qaddumi] First comes coordination. We are 
one people and one country. In fact, coordination and 
cooperation are a must. We should explore the future and how 
the situation will be in the Middle East. The Jordanians and 
the Palestinians are one people and have common interests. The 
aim is to organize these common interests in the future, to draw 
up rules for them, and to reinforce the brotherly ties between 
us. The previous experiences we have faced as one unit cannot 
be seen as just a relationship between one country and another, 
but as one among the members of one family. This is our concept 
of the work for which we have come and for the future we want to 
work out together, God willing. 
  [Reporter] There is a crisis in Jordanian-Palestinian 
relations. What are the dimensions of this crisis? 
  [Qaddumi] There is no crisis. This is, regrettably, the 
creation of Arab or non-Arab media. There is, in fact, a 
persisting desire to carry out joint action because we are 
moving toward a serious stage. This esplains his majesty's 
statement that stressed desire to base relations on sound 
foundations. This, in fact, is our opinion and our trend. 
Therefore, what is being portrayed as a crisis is not a crisis 
at all. There is not crisis among the members of one family.

pertaining to the peace march, and Jordanian-Palestinian 
coordination on these issues. 
  In a statement to the press following the meeting, Dr.

imposed by circumstances, geographical borders, demographic 
factors, and common destiny. 
  He added that there is complete agreement over principles 
and 
goals between the Jordanian and Palestinian delegations, 
explaining that today's talks dealt with the policies through 
which these principles are translated into reality. He also 
noted that the talks were held at the highest level of 
responsibility, cordiality, and brotherhood, pointing out that 
the talks would resume this evening. He then expressed his hope 
that the talks will produce satisfactory results acceptable to 
all of us. The Jordanian delegation to the meetings includes

During the meeting, they exchanged views on latest developments 
in the peace process and the importance of true and serious

  [Text] The Jordanian and the Palestinian officials held 
another round of talks this evening. Minister of Information 
Dr. Jawad al-'Anani said the talks were open and candid, but 
that tangible results have yet to be achieved. 
  [Begin recording] [Al-'Anani] Well, I think that the 
meetings 
were very open, very candid. They dealt with down-to-earth 
issues. It was very much businesslike. We have agreed that we 
agree on the basic principles and the guiding aims for our 
internal dialogue. However, we feel that this is necessary but 
not sufficient. What is sufficient is to arrive at tangible and 
practical steps that people can feel, make a difference of their 
own lives. And we assure them that the process of negotiations 
is going to ensure their own concerns. 
  [Reporter] Dr. al-'Anani: Do you think that the king's last 
speech has put a lot more pressure on the PLO to deal with the 
issues that are still in the air with the Palestinians and 
Jordanians? 
  [Al-'Anani] I do not need to analyze his majesty's motives. 
I think that the speech of his majesty was very clear, very 
candid. He was showing a great deal of concern that we need more 
coordination, and this coordination is not only a Jordanian 
demand, but it is a Jordanian as well as a Palestinian demand. 
  [Reporter] When do you expect the signing? 
  [Al-'Anani] We expect that we should continue to negotiate.

  [Text] The Higher Jordanian-Palestinian Joint Committee 
has concluded its second round of talks at the Foreign Ministry. 
Details are in the following report by our political affairs 
correspondent: 
  The Higher Jordanian-Palestinian Joint Committee this 
evening 
concluded its second round of talks at the Foreign Ministry. In 
statements to reporters, Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of 
information and minister of state for cabinet affairs, said: 
  [Begin recording] [al-'Anani] In fact, our talks were very 
serious and candid. The issues were discussed in detail in 
order to arrive at tangible, practical, and implementable steps 
that people can feel. Therefore, at this stage, we will meet 
again tomorrow morning and perhaps tomorrow afternoon and even 
on Friday morning so that we can arrive at decisive results, 
because this is the purpose of these talks at this level. We 
are also taking into consideration that people are awaiting 
tangible results, which require very serious and clear talks 
that define the frameworks and practical steps. We both agreed 
that if we do not arrive at such results, then we will not have 
met the people's expectations. 
  [Reporter] So, Mr. Abu-Ahmad [al-'Anani], are there any 
pending issues between the two sides? 
  [Al-'Anani] We are discussing all issues that are of 
importance to both sides, especially at this stage. 
  [Reporter] Did the discussions focus on specific issues? 
  [Al-'Anani] Of course, we discussed many basic issues, 
including economic and banking issues, issues that deal with the 
negotiations on water, evacuees, and refugees, the Jerusalem 
issue, as well as the need to coordinate stands on these issues 
and others that deal with the transitional phase and what is 
currently being negotiated in this regard to serve the two 
parties' interests. We, of course, have joint interests and 
what harms the Palestinians harms us and what benefits our 
brothers and kinfolk in the West Bank and Gaza Strip benefits us 
here in Jordan. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Analysis" by JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>
  [Text] Amman -- Jordan's ultimatum to the Palestine 
Liberation Organisation (PLO) this week was a last-ditch attempt 
to bring back the concept of comprehensiveness to the 
Arab-Israeli negotiations, analysts and observers believe. 
  In his address Tuesday [4 January] to senior officers from 
the Public Security General Intelligence and Civil Defence 
departments, His Majesty King Husayn expressed his "hope (that) 
we will reach a comprehensive peace with the help of all 
parties." 
  Jordanian officials privately say that the Kingdom was 
worried that the lack of coordination among the Arab parties to 
Middle East peace negotiations was leading to the disintegration 
of the concept of comprehensiveness, on which these negotiations 
were initially based, allowing Israel a chance to divide and 
rule. 
  According to those officials, the Kingdom has come under 
Syrian pressure to drop attempts to bring the PLO back into Arab 
coordination ranks and work instead towards 
Syrian-Jordanian-Lebanese coordination without the Palestinians. 
  In view of the fact that the "separate Oslo accord" is going 
nowhere, the message from Syria was that the upcoming summit 
meeting in Geneva between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and 
U.S. President Bill Clinton could be the the right opportunity 
for the three countries to show PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat that 
they have the upper hand. 
  But the question, according to officials and analysts, was 
whether Jordan would join such a coalition and give up on 
attempts to convince the PLO to coordinate with the Kingdom. 
  Analysts believe that this development placed Jordan in a 
difficult position since Mr. 'Arafat had been continually 
procrastinating over sending his aides to Amman to attend 
coordination committee talks scheduled to have started last June 
but which never did. 
  This sentiment was actually expressed by Minister of 
Information Jawad al-'Anani this week when he said Jordan feared 
that the lack of Jordanian-Palestinian coordination would force 
the country "to react in a way that is not in line with its 
overall policy." 
  To drop the idea of a comprehensive settlement and allow 
different Arab parties to reach separate peace accords with 
Israel would have defied Jordan's policy of waiting until all 
tracks have concluded their negotiations with Israel 
successfully before signing accords simultaneously. 
  Since Jordanians feel almost certain that President al-'Asad 
will get something from his meeting with President Clinton on 
Jan. 16, they felt that they were running out of time in 
bringing Arab parties to the talks to coordinate their steps and 
exchange information on developments on their tracks. 
  Senior Jordanian officials are constructing scenarios for 
progress on the Syrian front. They believe that while Syria is 
not expected to give in on its declared intention to accept full 
withdrawal, it may accept a time-tabled agenda leading to that 
conclusion if it receives American assurances that would 
guarantee its economic and security interests. 
  If this turns out to be true, one seasoned analyst said, 
Syria might be seen to be willing to give up its Arab leadership 
role if the Americans can station American or international 
troops on the border, maintain Syrian interests in Lebanon and 
allow Damascus to reap economic benefits of peace. 
  But Jordan also believes that if this happens without 
achieving tangible progress on the Palestinian front, there will 
be the risk of Arab-Israeli negotiations running into two 
separate "courses" -- Syrian-Lebanese-Israeli and 
Palestinian-Jordanian-Israeli -- instead of the four streamlined 
tracks. 
  The Jordanians fear that such a scenario, if it actually 
develops, will further weaken the Arab position and give Israel 
the opportunity to "hunt down" each Arab party individually. 
  This fear was also expressed by Dr. al-'Anani when he told a 
group of journalists earlier this week that the Kingdom feared 
ending up "with separate courses rather than tracks." 
  And while Dr. al-'Anani was willing to concede that these 
separate courses are historically present because of common 
interests, he feared that lack of coordination among the 
Jordanians and Palestinians would create inertia by making (the 
parties) rivals and competitive in dealing with Israel at the 
expense of each other. 
  In a statement he made Tuesday, Syrian Vice President 
'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam referred to the comprehensiveness of the 
negotiations by saying "the concept of comprehensiveness cannot 
be ignored (and has to come) in coordination with Lebanon and 
Jordan." 
  Mr. Khaddam did not mention the PLO as part of the 
comprehensive solution but criticised it for signing the 
declaration of principles (DoP) and predicted that "Israel would 
emerge the winner" as a result of this move. 
  The Syrians did not hide their displeasure with Jordan over 
the latter's agenda agreement with Israel, which was signed in 
Washington on Sept. 14, not only because they might have thought 
it was a prelude to reaching a separate peace treaty with the 
Jewish state, but also because it gave a diplomatic and 
political cover for the Sept. 13 agreement between the PLO and 
Israel. 
  Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar', at the time, issued 
what was seen as a warning to Jordan, but the issue was diffused 
soon afterwards when King Husayn visited President al-Asad in 
Damascus and reportedly assured him that Amman would not go it 
alone despite all the pressures it faced from the Americans and 
Israelis. 
  Officials and analysts here believe that Jordan cannot forge 
coordination with Syria and that this was made clear in His 
Majesty's statement Tuesday when he said that he had spoken 
about coordination with Syria, Lebanon and Egypt. "We have 
proven our commitment to work together. No one should believe 
that we will go it alone in this regard." 
  But while the Kingdom is committed to coordination with 
Syria, politicians agree that Jordan could not respond 
positively to dropping the PLO from coordination efforts because 
"it is a complicated and intricate relationship." 
  The King's virtual ultimatum to the PLO, while indicative of 
"tension" in relations between the two leaderships, can and 
should "serve interests of both Jordan and the PLO without 
hurting relations with Syria," one official said.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 6, IRNA -- The leader of the Islamic 
revolution, Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i on Thursday [6 January] 
called for maintenance and consolidation of the friendly 
relations between Iran and Turkmenistan. 
  Receiving the visiting Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov

cooperation in various fields will be to the benefit of 
Turkmenistan and Iran. 
  There exist good cultural ties and common religious bonds

Turkmenistan as a "divine blessing," the supreme leader 
expressed hope that the foundations of Turkmenistan's 
independence will grow stronger in the future. 
  The Turkmen president thanked the leader of the Islamic 
revolution for favouring promotion of Tehran-Ashgabat relations, 
and expressed confidence that bilateral relations will be 
broadened despite the wish of enemies of the two countries. 
  President Niyazov also referred to the construction of 
hundreds of mosques in his country over the past two years, 
saying the Turkmen people were reviving their past history and 
practicing their religion freely.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 5, IRNA -- Afghan Ambassador to Tehran 
Mohammad Kheyrkhah said here Wednesday [5 January] that remnants 
of the former communist regime of Afghanistan who have 
infiltrated mojahedin groups are responsible for the current 
clashes and insecurity in the country. 
  He said former members of the Parcham (flag) and Khalq 
(people) Parties and militias supporting them, misused the 
general amnesty in Afghanistan. "The Islamic government will no 
longer pardon the rebels who challenge the authority of the 
government," he warned. 
  Kheyrkhah added that the Afghan Government has never 
recognized the militias supporting General 'Abdol Rashid Dostam. 
  He was critical of Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar who 
leads the Hezb-e Eslami and said he was trying to take advantage 
of any "illegal leverage" to strike a blow on the Islamic 
government. 
  According to the Afghan diplomat most of the mojahedin 
parties are firmly behind the Kabul government in the recent 
clashes which began four days ago. 
  President Rabbani's forces have mopped up central Kabul of 
Hekmatyar's and Dostum's forces and are going ahead with their 
cleaning up operations in the suburb of Kabul, he said. 
  Kheyrkhah said government forces have attacked Dostum's 
headquarters in the northern city of Mazar-e Sharif, captured 
the airport and forced Dostum to flee the city.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan 6 (AFP)--The Iranian Foreign Ministry 
has dragged its feet in trying to secure a truce between the 
warring factions in Afghanistan, the semi-official TEHRAN TIMES 
charged Thursday [6 January]. 
  The English-language daily accused the ministry of acting 
"sluggishly" in undertaking a "not-so-successful" effort to 
secure a ceasefire in Kabul earlier this week. 
  "It could have launched an extensive diplomatic move through 
contacting the warring sides as well as regional countries in a 
bid to contain the war," it said. "This sluggishness is in no 
way justifiable." 
  Tehran said on Tuesday that the rival Afghan forces had 
agreed to a truce in response to an Iranian offer to evacuate 
some of the wounded from Kabul. 
  A spokesman said the representatives of Afghan President 
Borhanoddin Rabbani and Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar had 
informed the foreign ministry of their acceptance. 
  However heavy fighting has been continuing for six days, 
with 
the forces of former communist general 'Abdol Rashid Dostam 
pounding Kabul from the air and ground on Thursday. 
  The forces of Dostam and Hekmatyar have been battling 
alongside each other for control of the capital in the worst 
fighting in Kabul in six months. 
  More than 2,000 people have been killed or wounded since the 
fighting began on Saturday.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "The United States--Repetition of </F>
Its Errors"] 
  [Text] In view of its military defeat in Somalia, the U.S. 
forces are in the process of withdrawing from that country and 
as a reaction to this defeat, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin has 
resigned. This is a clear indication of the impotence and 
decrepitude of the U.S. foreign policy as regards international 
affairs in the post Cold War era. THE WASHINGTON TIMES 
newspaper carried an analytical article with repetitive remarks 
regarding Iran which is evidence of the blind hostility and 
animosity of the U.S. echelons with regard to Iran. It appears 
that the U.S. analysts are seeking to compensate for the utter 
humiliation that they had to endure in their current defeat by 
initiating another psychological war! 
  The analyst of the aforementioned newspaper has cited a 
Pentagon source stating: "The U.S. planning for a possible 
clash with Iran began quite a while ago and war with Iran is 
inevitable, as Iran is considered a potential enemy of the 
United States; Washington takes Iran's strength very 
seriously." The Pentagon official has not specified the time 
frame for this war, but has stated: "The Pentagon echelons are 
assuming that there will be a juncture when Iran will take some 
action that will necessitate a reaction on the part of the 
United States." 
  In attempting to justify these allegations by the Pentagon 
officials, the newspaper analyst mentioned various instances 
that could prove to be possible pretexts for the United States 
to embroil itself in a conflict with Iran, such as an attempt 
against a CIA official's life, Iran's uncompromising attitude 
toward the Zionist regime's compromise [with the PLO] and has 
stressed: "Apparently, the United States is the only country in 
the world that takes the threat of Iran seriously." According 
to THE WASHINGTON TIMES, this U.S. Department of Defense 
official claimed: "In the past two years, Iran has purchased 
weapons worth billions of dollars and, apart from the U.S. 
military presence in the Persian Gulf, Iran is the strongest 
country in the region today." This official has expressed his 
concern over the mounting spiritual clout of Iran among the 
Muslim countries of Africa and Asia, and even in Europe, 
stating: "The religious decree against Salman Rushdie is so 
harsh that it forced the U.S. President to apologize to the 
Muslims for the few minutes of his meeting with Rushdie in the 
White House." 
  As to the fact that plans for a possible U.S. clash with 
Iran 
began quite a while ago, there is not the slightest doubt. One 
can say that these plans began on the morning of the victory of 
the Islamic Revolution and since the inception of the Islamic 
movement, in fact. In the course of the last years, U.S. 
officials have always considered war with Iran imminent and have 
even experimented with it in instances such as the "Tabas 
incident." [attempt to liberate the U.S. hostages] 
  Thus, the mention of such allegations is not new for 
Iranians, as Iran's stance on a confrontation with the United 
States is too clear to require any such pretexts. Therefore, 
what purpose does the repetition of such remarks serve, 
especially claims such as "Iran purchased billions of dollars 
worth of weapons..." and so on? It appears that the U.S. has 
had failures one after the other in trying to forge its "new 
world order." The resulting vacuum in the bipolar world has 
motivated the residual elements of the Cold War in the United 
States to try to compensate for their failures and to fill the 
existing vacuum by carving out a new pole. It is for this 
purpose that they are after Iran, as they have admitted 
themselves that "Iran's spiritual clout among the Muslim 
countries of Africa, Asia, even of Europe is a source of 
concern." 
  Even though Iran has sought to forge new relations with the 
West and to mitigate the existing tension, such propaganda 
fanned by the U.S. media indicates that the Westerners--the 
Americans in particular--are not willing to learn a lesson from 
the past or to comprehend the changes that have emerged in Iran 
and the world. They still think that by indulging in 
belligerence and propagandistic blackmail, they can pursue their 
illicit interests. Such experiments have lost their novelty for 
Iranians and only strengthen their determination on the path to 
a confrontation with the Americans. When the hungry Somalis can 
send the bodies of American soldiers home, the more 
war-experienced people of Iran are well aware of their 
obligations. 
  Today, more than ever before, the remarks of the imam become 
clear to intelligent people: "The United States cannot do 
anything wrong to Iran." The U.S. officials and analysts are 
requested to attend to their insolvent economy instead of 
voicing such claims and allegations in the media and they should 
challenge their Asian and European rivals instead. Of course, 
in order to succeed in this battle, the United States should 
reappraise its relations with Third World countries. Third 
World countries in general now tend to lean toward Japan and 
Europe, which can only expedite the U.S. defeat on the 
international level. It would be well worth their while for the 
U.S. officials to think of peace rather than warmongering and 
not to dissipate their resources in wars in Iraq, Somalia, and 
so on. 
  The wise learn from their mistakes and do not repeat them. 
If the U.S. officials insist on repeating their errors, the 
Iranian people are ready to teach them a lesson that they will 
never forget.

Article Type:BFN 

<F P=106> [Final installment of a two-part "exclusive" interview with </F>
Dr. Mohammad Javad Larijani, head of the Majles Research Center; 
place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [RESALAT] The United States and Israel pursued 
specific objectives in the Gaza-Jericho accord. Among the most 
important of these objectives was extinguishing the struggle 
against the occupiers of Jerusalem and fomenting a conflict 
among the Palestinian groups. 
  During the period since 'Arafat's agreement with the 
Zionists, have they been able to approach their objective? 
  [Larijani] The United States and Israel expected that most 
of 
the Palestinians would accept the Gaza-Jericho accord. They 
claimed that 65 percent of the Palestinians would accept this 
accord. What Israel truly wanted was to hand over a small piece 
of populous land like Gaza or Jericho in exchange for the 
disappearance of the intifadah. It also wanted the doors of the 
world of Islam to be opened so that it could enter this world. 
Of course, the oppressed Palestinian people displayed very 
sharp political instincts during this phase. 
  No matter how I examine this issue, I think that the first 
phase of the plan has been a complete failure because the 
intifadah is intensifying. The Israelis are saying that 
elections will take place if the intifadah ends but that Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] cannot gain the majority of votes! 
Therefore, the Israelis have reached an interesting impasse 
that has revealed many things. They came forward in the name of 
democracy. But because it was possible that 'Arafat would not 
gain any votes, they decided it would be advisable to put an end 
to democracy and to select a group of people to manage the area 
themselves! 
  I think that the failure of these two phases is very 
substantial, and, God willing, other defeats will come. There 
was a time when Israel only faced the armies of Arab countries. 
Today it is facing an extremely strong and growing body--the 
body formed by awakened Muslims. This body is much stronger and 
more dangerous than the armies and their weapons. For example, 
once Israel became friends with the Egyptian Government, the 
Egyptian Army was no longer considered a threat to Israel. 
Israel has not been able to ignore the people and the Muslim 
masses that have started to advance, however. Therefore, there 
is an immense Islamic movement facing Israel today, and this is 
much worse for it than an army. 
  Israel insists that, along with the compromise plan, the 
doors of the world of Islam must be opened upon it. It believes 
that if these doors are not opened now, it will be more 
difficult to do so in the future. This is also proof that the 
Islamic movement is advancing. God willing, this Islamic 
movement will become established in the world of Islam, and it 
will save the world of Islam from Israeli domination and plots. 
  [RESALAT] Can the contrariness that has emerged in Islamic 
and Western cultures be resolved? Some people might think that 
we can work together on common points. Is this contrariness 
such that they can justify this way of thinking? 
  [Larijani] The correct word here is not contrariness or 
equivocation. The Westerners influence the world of Islam and 
want to expand and maintain this influence. Therefore, they 
have started an onslaught against our wealth, our independence, 
and our culture. But the world of Islam is resisting. This 
onslaught is aimed at gaining influence over the world of Islam. 
Its history can be traced. Over the past century, the West has 
been able to split the world of Islam into small pieces, plunder 
Islamic resources, and place its own men in power in many key 
parts of the world. In other words, their political influence 
and economic plundering have very extensive cultural aspects. 
And it is against this Western onslaught that the world of 
Islam is defending itself. [passage omitted] 
  The reason why Iran is a target of this onslaught is because 
we have hoisted the banner of confrontation. Fortunately, this 
banner is now in the hands of all Muslims and will be handed to 
the next generation. [passage omitted] 
  [RESALAT] France's decision to grant refuge to a number of 
terrorists has enraged the people of Iran. What steps does the 
Majles intend to take to confront this act by France? 
  [Larijani] Of course, I did not want the West and France to 
act differently toward the world of Islam, but we do not fear 
anyone when it comes to safeguarding our interests and our 
security. Fortunately, our country is an extremely strong and 
stable country. There are not many countries in the region that 
enjoy the power and stability that we do. 
  I believe that the world cannot advance on the basis of the 
hostilities that the Westerners are creating today and on the 
basis of their overt intervention, lies, and duplicities. They 
have seen that we are serious about confronting terrorism, and 
yet their countries are the hearths of terrorism! They say that 
insulting a prostitute is tantamount to a violation of human 
rights, but they are prepared to place thousands in front of 
their own firing squads! I think that this era is ending, 
however. 
  As far as establishing relations with the world is 
concerned, 
we should keep two points in mind. The first is that we should 
get to know ourselves--get to know what we have to say and where 
we are going. The second is that we should be able to stand on 
our own two feet. If the esteemed leader emphasizes the need 
for self-sufficiency and for standing on our own two feet, it is 
because we must be able to express ourselves in the best 
possible way to continue living in this world and to be able to 
say what we have to say to the world. This is the only way our 
relations with the world can have a completely logical basis. 
Of course, these principles are more or less observed today, 
and I think that the West should not expect to have logical 
relations with us by imposing things on us. All the governments 
that tried to do so have failed. Experience has shown that 
cooperation with Iran can only be on the basis of mutual respect 
and reciprocal interests. 
  [RESALAT] How real do you consider the differences between 
Europe and the United States to be? What is our opinion of this? 
  [Larijani] Of course, this difference is deep-rooted, and it 
is still the beginning. The root of the differences between the 
two is economic rivalry. [passage omitted] 
  I think that the smaller the power monopoly in the world, 
the 
better it is for us. In other words, we can live in a world 
with a great deal of competition instead of a world divided into 
competitive blocs. [passage omitted] 
  [RESALAT] In the new world order, the United States has made 
great efforts to impose itself as the sole superpower in the 
world. However, it has been unable to do so, and the weaknesses 
in Clinton's personality, as well as the extensive criticisms 
against U.S. foreign policy, are good examples of this failure. 
What is your opinion? 
  [Larijani] What can be said to have definitely ended are the 
claims of world leadership by the United States. In other 
words, the world is not ready for a country like the United 
States to say that it is the leader of the world, nor is it 
ready to see the establishment of an exclusive club for world 
leadership. [passage omitted] 
  The West wants to transform the United Nations into a 
headquarters for world leadership. But the philosophy behind 
the formation of the United Nations was that it should be a 
forum for discussions among nations and not the headquarters of 
a world leadership. When they say that the United Nations 
should be decisive, have an army, safeguard peace, 
and--according to themselves--prevent any threats to peace, 
these are all incorrect charts of the course that the United 
Nations should take. 
  I think that the United Nations is extremely decisive and 
that this is sufficient. It should let the people of the world 
defend themselves. We should not expect the United Nations to 
send forces to Bosnia-Herzegovina. The United Nations has tied 
the hands of the Muslims there. I think that there should be 
some changes in the United Nations. We should support a 
decrease in the power of the Security Council and efforts to 
transform the United Nations into a forum where more discussions 
and debates take place. We should not expect the United Nations 
to act. We should ask all those who say that the United Nations 
should have the power to act: Under whose leadership? Where 
should it receive its orders from? They say: We will form a 
world rule for you. But world rule will be established when the 
imam of the ages reappears, God willing. 
  As for whether those who have strength should once again 
rule, I believe that in our strategy at the United Nations and 
in the Third World, we should support the idea of extracting the 
extra teeth of the United Nations because these teeth have 
always been beneficial for the hegemonists. Therefore, in this 
new phase a type of joint leadership for the world is a theory 
on which they are working and for this reason Japan and Germany 
too want to enter the Security Council. In other words, if one 
day the Americans opposed this idea, today they are insisting on 
it. Therefore, today they have descended one step from their 
previous position. But, God willing, their new theory too will 
soon be defeated and the human race will see better days.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Hasan Fathi: "Lebanon--The Need for Change </F>
in the Government"] 
  [Text] The day those who opposed the compromise between 
'Arafat and Rabin were subjected to a volley of bullets and 
demonstrators were dragged into blood and dust, the reality 
emerged that al-Hariri's government is not prepared to transform 
the country into a center for opposition by the opponents of the 
compromise for autonomy for Gaza and Jericho. 
  Then, most groups criticized the Lebanese Government but as 
time passed, the opposition decreased and ultimately the issue 
was relegated to oblivion. 
  This is because every government that comes to power in 
Lebanon is subservient to the policies of Damascus and should 
have some coordination with Syria. If al-Hariri's government 
fires a hail of bullets on the opponents of the Rabin-'Arafat 
accord or resists them in parliament, it is solely because of 
its affiliation with Damascus. 
  This government faces danger, as it has passed its expiry 
date and should make way for another government. The straits 
the government is in also relate to Syria. If, in the early 
days of the signing of the Gaza-Jericho autonomy accord by 
'Arafat and Rabin, Damascus reined in the various groups and 
promised the United States that it would prevent them from 
subversive activity, it was because the White House had pledged 
Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights. Syria's promise was 
endorsed by Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' and other 
Syrian officials. Syria also asked Lebanon to rein in 
opponents' activities and this was why the demonstrations were 
dragged into blood and dust. 
  Time has shown that the United States does not intend to 
honor its pledge to Syria, so Syria has revised its policy. 
Syria has hardened its stance on the Rabin-'Arafat accord, 
which was proven during the recent meetings between Warren 
Christopher and Syrian officials, which necessitated a review of 
the stance on the opponents of the Gaza-Jericho Accord by the 
al-Hariri government. 
  It now appears--in view of change and the crisis that has 
engulfed Lebanon--that the al-Hariri regime has reached the end 
of its tenure and should make way for a new government. There 
is talk of a former minister coming to power who leans more 
toward Syria and coordinates better with it. In such 
circumstances, the opposing groups, particularly the Islamic 
Resistance in south Lebanon, will extend their activity and 
escalate their attacks on Israel and Antoine Lahd's forces. 
This will continue until Damascus officially joins the peace 
trend and the problem of the Golan Heights is solved. Until 
then, Lebanon will follow the policies of Damascus and oppose 
the peace trend.

"In the Margin of the President's Remarks"] 
  [Text] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani remarks to students of 
Martyr Beheshti University in which he criticized the stance of 
the mass media on economic issues and especially commented on 
the reasons behind the rise in foreign exchange rates. These 
remarks make it necessary to give the following explanations. 
  Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani said about foreign debts: "It is true 
that in the current year we have been unable to repay some of 
our foreign debts. But the media are wrong in reporting that 
these debts are high." 
  Of course, it is a source of pleasure that the president, as 
the highest ranking executive official of the country, has, at 
any rate, accepted the fact that we have not been able to repay 
our foreign debts on the due date in the current year. When the 
country's high-ranking officials have correct information on 
this issue but do not place this information at the disposal of 
the people and the mass media, then rumors start. There is no 
doubt that under such conditions each person refers to one 
figure or another. But we know that the total amount of our 
foreign debt is somewhere near $28 billion, of which $10 billion 
are for goods that we have committed ourselves to purchase but 
which have not yet been delivered. If the government wants to, 
it can cancel these orders and not add to the $18 billion of 
debts that we already have and out of which $8 billion had to be 
repaid by the government this year. If this problem is not 
solved, this figure will increase in the coming years. These 
are figures and information that the press has been able to 
gather from here and there. 
  But what is Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani criticizing? Does he 
believe that the press should not tell the truth? Or is he 
criticizing the fact that the figures were published? Does he 
believe that these figures are incorrect? Then why do the 
officials not come out and state the true figures to the press? 
Naturally, the best way to prevent incorrect reporting is 
through a realistic approach by the officials. 
  The president also said: "If there are pressures as far as 
the repayment of debts is concerned, it is because our creditors 
are not our friends and the plans that they have drawn up are 
such that they have not given us enough time for repayment." 
  This statement in itself shows that Iran should have been 
more careful about which country it received loans from. 
Frankly speaking, what need was there for us to get loans for 
our reconstruction and economic development from countries or 
companies that are not our friends? Does this mean that we have 
asked for loans and assistance from our enemies? How can this 
be justified? What need is there for us to carry out 
transactions with someone who is not our friend? But we deal 
with countries like Japan, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and 
other countries that Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani's government has 
repeatedly described as friends of the Islamic Republic and he 
has called for the expansion of relations with them. However, 
when the press questioned the quality and the quantity of our 
relations with these countries, our officials described these 
efforts by the press as a type of obstructionism in Iran's 
foreign relations and told us that we cannot avoid relations 
with a country that wants to be our friend and that the press 
should not resort to such obstructionism. Then how is it that 
these countries were our friends then and have now become our 
enemies and are obstructing matters? Is it not that we resorted 
to an unrestrained expansion of relations with these countries 
without taking true conditions into consideration? Is it not 
that we set foot on a wrong path without carrying out the 
necessary calculations? 
  The other point is that it has been repeatedly stated that 
foreign loans and investments were in economic and fundamental 
fields that promised immediate returns that would ensure the 
rapid repayment of these loans. But this has not happened. Was 
this because of wrong policies? Is it correct for us to receive 
a loan from the World Bank and build the huge building of the 
Central Bank and other such projects instead of using it for 
profitable fields such as agriculture and so on? Naturally, 
when a foreign loan is taken out for the Central Bank, it will 
not have any economic returns and cannot ensure an income with 
which we can repay a loan when it expires. Is it correct for us 
to allocate World Bank loans to development projects and then 
face a difficulty in repaying them? 
  Basically, why do we expect the repayment time for our debts 
to expire and the creditor not to request payment, and then--if 
he expresses lack of confidence in us--to think that he is our 
enemy? This is an irrational expectation. We should plan so as 
to avoid difficulties when it comes to meeting our commitments. 
  If from the very beginning we had foreseen all these 
conditions, it would have been better for us not to seek loans 
at all. It would have been better if the reconstruction of 
Rudbar and Manjil had been completed a year late, if the huge 
Central Bank building had not been constructed, and if the plan 
for the surface waters of Tehran and its suburbs had not been 
completed rather than for us to pawn our country's prestige for 
such development projects. 
  Stating these points is not critical or antagonistic. It is 
only a realistic belief that the people should be informed about 
such issues, that the officials should be broad-minded enough to 
realize that the press is reflecting problems in an unbiased 
manner, and to compile programs to solve these problems.

<F P=106> [Second and last installment of an unattributed commentary: </F>
"In the Margin of the President's Remarks"] 
  [Text] One of the interesting points in the remarks the 
president made at the gathering of students of Martyr Beheshti 
University and in his remarks when presenting the bill on the 
Second Five-Year Plan as well as the bill on the budget to the 
Majles was his reference to the fact that oil and oil prices 
will not have a major impact on the country's economy and 
reconstruction. The president told the students: "Even if oil 
prices fall to $10 a barrel, we will not face a problem." 
  In his remarks to the Majles when presenting the budget 
bill, 
he said: "Oil is one of the country's major sources of income 
and recently income from this important resource has dropped 20 
to 30 percent and has affected our Plan. This made us review 
and readjust our Plan and our budget. This was a very difficult 
task; hence, the two-week delay in presenting the budget." 
  The basic problem is that the main slogan of our economy 
after the Islamic revolution has been the need to try to 
decrease the role of oil in our country's economy; and one of 
the major objectives stated in the First Plan was the need to 
alter the country's economic infrastructure and to gradually 
decrease the role of oil. If today we compare our budget with 
our budget four years ago, we will not see a perceptible change 
in the true dependence on oil incomes, and this point was 
extremely clear in the president's remarks as well. Now we 
should try to see why--despite extensive plans that have been 
implemented and the extensive investments that have been 
made--our dependence on oil incomes has not perceptibly changed. 
  In part of his remarks to Martyr Beheshti University 
students, the president stated that the drop in the exchange 
rate is due to the psychological atmosphere that has been 
created and that the drop in oil prices is a plot by world 
arrogance. The issue is that if we have really reached a stage 
where even the drop in oil prices to $10 a barrel is not a 
problem for us, then why--during the past one month--has there 
been a 100 percent rise in the exchange rate of the dollar? If 
between 20 to 30 percent of this stems from the psychological 
atmosphere and because of middlemen, then the remaining 50 to 60 
percent definitely stems from the drop in oil prices that form a 
large part of our country's foreign exchange income. Or if we 
glance at the figures in next year's budget, we can see that 
more than 50 percent of our country's incomes will be from the 
sale of oil. 
  Under these conditions, can the sudden drop in the price of 
oil to almost half--a resource that represents 50 percent of our 
income--not create acute problems for us? It is true that 
within the framework of our macroeconomic plans, a large part of 
foreign exchange allocations for basic and industrial products 
has dropped but because of uncalculated economic and commercial 
policies, this foreign exchange economizing has not 
materialized. On the contrary, an unrestrained quantity of 
foreign exchange has been spent for the import of consumer and 
luxury goods. In these four years, because of the 
implementation of positive economic projects such as the 
petrochemical, aluminum, steel, and other industries, we have 
been able to save on between $1-$2 billion in foreign exchange 
each year--which is an extremely optimistic figure--but we have 
spent billions of dollars to import luxury items such as color 
television sets, household goods, cars, Coca Cola, chocolate, 
clothing, and other unnecessary items. If we accept the 
above-mentioned facts, then we will see that these unrestrained 
imports have wasted all our savings or our foreign exchange 
incomes from our exports of industrial and non-industrial goods. 
This is why oil and income from it during the past four years 
have continued to play a key role in current expenditures and in 
economic and development plans. And it is because of this that 
the fluctuations in the dollar and foreign exchange rates have 
been between 100 to 120 percent. This fluctuation and drop is 
because of the weakness of our national currency, and the 
weakness of our national currency is because of the fact that 
our true gross national product is low. If economizing in 
foreign exchange and in foreign exchange incomes coupled with 
economic projects could have led to economic investments, the 
gross national product could have increased and a rise in the 
gross national product could have paved the way for a brighter 
future and the repayment of our foreign debts. And if correct 
plans had been drawn up, we would not have faced acute problems 
that we are facing today in meeting our foreign exchange 
commitments. Saying that such debts should not have existed in 
the First Plan is unprincipled. But the fact these debts have 
reached the level they have during the past four years is 
because of our failure to create a balance between incomes and 
expenditures and the implementation of economic plans. 
  Stating these points is in no way a criticism and should be 
considered only to be within the framework of our interests 
because basically, the ability to see realities and to create a 
correct basis for plans and programs can help the government 
achieve the objectives that it has laid out.

  [Text] India and Uzbekistan have expressed the resolve to 
counter religious fundamentalism and terrorism. They have also 
signed six agreements in joint ventures, economic ties, trade, 
and science and technology to strengthen bilateral ties. 
  Addressing a joint press conference after the signing of the 
agreements in New Delhi, the visiting Uzbekistan president, Mr. 
Karimov, and Prime Minister Mr. Narasimha Rao said the forces of 
extremism threatened the democratic and secular fabric of the 
two nations. Mr. Rao said that he had told Mr. Karimov that 
India is determined to fight cross-border terrorism. Mr. 
Karimov said his country believes in the principle of 
noninterference in internal affairs of other states and favors a 
settlement to the Kashmir issue through negotiations. Their 
discussion covered several matters, including bilateral 
cooperation and nonalignment. Mr. Karimov said there is a good 
scope for Indian enterprises to export consumer goods and set up 
joint ventures. His country is specially interested in 
importing tea, tobacco, and textiles from India. Mr. Narasima 
Rao disclosed that an Indian bank and a cultural center will 
start functioning in Uzbekistan shortly. He said India has also 
offered to assist him in training his personnel in banking, 
management and mass communication, and diplomacy. The agreement 
signed also covered postal and related matters, 
telecommunications, setting up of an Indo-Uzbek center for 
science and technology, transport, and transit. 
  The Uzbekistan president has described his visit to India as 
very satisfactory. He was talking to newsmen at Rashtrapati 
Bhavan [President House] before leaving for Tashkent today. The 
president, Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma; the prime minister, Mr. 
Narasimha Rao; and his cabinet colleagues were among those 
present at the ceremonial farewell.

<F P=106> [Commentary by T. Jayaraj] </F>
  [Text] Terrorism has developed into epidemic proportion the 
world over causing much concern to humanity as it subverts 
economic development and progress of nations. Reiteration to 
fight this menace rightly came from the visiting Uzbekistan 
president, Mr. Islam Karimov, and the prime minister, Mr. 
Narasimha Rao, when they addressed a joint press conference in 
New Delhi yesterday. The two leaders resolved to fight 
terrorism and counter religious fundamentalism for the 
well-being of their citizens. They also agreed that the forces 
of extremism threaten the democratic and secular fabric of the 
two nations. 
  This is exactly in confirmation with the erstwhile Soviet 
policy of supporting India's stand that recourse to violence 
leads nowhere and that any problem should be resolved through 
peaceful negotiations. As Uzbekistan discarded the totalitarian 
ideology and accepted the norms of multiparty system and 
diversity of opinion, it is now [willing] to seek meaningful 
cooperation with countries having the same perceptions. Mr. 
Karimov's three-day stay in the Indian capital as a follow up of 
Mr. Narasimha Rao's visit to Tashkent in May last year is a 
reassurance for the growing geopolitical relationship between 
the two Asian neighbors. During the talks, Mr. Karimov had with 
several Indian leaders both the countries came out with renewed 
vigor to tackle cross border terrorism and accelerate the pace 
of economic ties for mutual benefits. 
  The six agreements signed between the two leaders on joint 
ventures, economic ties, trade, and science and technology are 
expressions of the desire for strengthening the traditional good 
relations for faster economic progress of the two countries. 
Indeed, there is an urgent need to prevent conflicts and work 
towards expanding and developing regional and international 
cooperation. The first meeting of the Indo-Uzbek Joint 
Commission held in July last year and the measures it devised 
were efforts towards achieving this goal. 
  Economic cooperation is not simply for monetary benefits 
alone, but it provides a forum for consolidating views on 
promoting political stability and world peace. Today, a nation 
cannot grow in isolation. History has witnessed the Central 
Asian region as a major confluence of cultural and economic 
activity. It is hoped that the future will witness creative 
interaction between the two Asian neighbors.

<F P=106> [By A.R. Deo: "Pakistan's Double-Speak"] </F>
  [Text] Pakistani authorities have often spoken with two 
voices on their country's nuclear programme. Generally it is 
described as a purely peaceful programme. But when it comes to 
reacting to US pressures on non-proliferation Pakistan stoutly 
defends it as being vital for its security typifying the 
inherent dilemma before Pakistani thinkers on many national 
issues. This, of course, does not surprise those who have 
followed the general Pakistani discourse on defence or foreign 
policy. 
  Nawaz Sharif also said during a National Assembly debate 
that 
the government will not be permitted to cap or to roll back the 
nuclear programme which was a guarantee of Pakistan's freedom 
and independence. In his winding-up remarks Foreign Minister 
Sardar Assef Ahmad Ali said that he would continue to counter 
all attempts at creating misunderstandings regarding Pakistan's 
nuclear programme. He reaffirmed that a political decision had 
been taken to use this capability for peaceful purposes only. 
  Shortly thereafter, Sadar Assef who was visiting Dhaka for 
the SAARC [South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation] 
Foreign Ministers' meeting shocked his audience by declaring 
that Pakistan would "continue with its nuclear programme as long 
as threat of war with its traditional rival India exists.... 
Nuclear capability should not be an exclusive privilege of the 
western world or India." At least one daily, THE MUSLIM, has 
questioned the wisdom of Sardar Assef's utterances. The current 
phase of debate on Pakistan's nuclear policy began with Benazir 
Bhutto's statement that the programme had been capped in 1990. 
Nawaz Sharif denounced any possibility of capping as an 
anti-national act. 
  Gen Aslam Beg, a former Chief of Army Staff, has now come 
out 
with a signed article in THE NATION . He recalls that it was an 
American, Richard Barlow, who had "unequivocally asserted" that 
Pakistan had acquired nuclear capability in 1987. The US 
Administration chose to ignore this report so long as Soviet 
forces remained in Afghanistan but used the same (Barlow report) 
to accuse Pakistan of having crossed the red light. 
  Gen Beg admitted openly that Pakistan "had embarked on all 
the nuclear steps simultaneously". These were: uranium 
enrichment up to 95 per cent and above; preparation of the 
device by integrating all its elements; laboratory tests of all 
the elements of the device; final test of the integrated system 
either by detonation (hot test) or without it through a cold 
test; developing the delivery system. 
  He also confirmed that Pakistan had developed this capacity 
in 1987 and added that the process of freezing the first stage 
of this programme had "actually started in January 1989, that is 
after a deliberate and conscious decision taken in a conference 
co-chaired by the then President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and the then 
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto." There was thus "no substance" to 
Benazir's allegation that she was kept in the dark about 
Pakistan's nuclear programme. 
  According to Gen Beg, phase one of the programme was frozen 
at the 3 percent enrichment level. "Subsequently, phase two got 
automatically frozen because of lack of the basic material i.e. 
enriched weapon grade uranium. The process of freezing, 
disclosed Gen Beg, "continued during Nawaz Sharif's tenure. The 
United States is now intensifying the pressure on Pakistan to 
roll back its programme and exterminate the capability which 
Pakistan has acquired after years of toil and sacrifice." 
  Now Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan, commonly considered as the father 
of the Pakistani bomb, has surfaced with his own cryptic 
observation that the programme was never capped or uncapped and 
directed further enquiries to the Chief of Army Staff [COAS]. 
Reminding his audience that he was still a government servant, 
he volunteered his opinion that no one can accept a thing 
detrimental to the country's security or defence nor must he do 
so. Dr Khan is mercifully silent on whether the COAS could agree 
to freezing (or roll-back) if he thought that doing so would not 
be detrimental to Pakistan's security or defence. 
  In the meantime Benazir has once again publicly reaffirmed 
Pakistan's determination not to roll back the nuclear programme 
since non-proliferation in South Asia was regional issue. 
Pakistan, she reiterated, will not sign the Nuclear 
non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] unless India also signs it. 
  With all these statements it is quite evident that Pakistan 
had acquired nuclear capability (crossed the red light) in 1987, 
that Washington was fully aware of it but chose to ignore this 
fact in providing the annual certification to the US Congress, 
that Benazir was a party to the freezing decision taken in 
January 1989 and her disclaimer in Washington that she was kept 
in the dark about Pakistan's nuclear programme was disingenuous. 
  That Pakistan is in possession of one or more nuclear 
devices 
is indirectly confirmed by its acquisition of missiles from 
China. Caretaker Prime Minister Moir Qureshi had said on August 
26 that "the short range tactical missiles Pakistan received 
were required to meet our legitimate self-defence 
requirements... As a sovereign state Pakistan cannot and will 
not sacrifice its right to take whatever step we deem necessary 
for its security." Qureshi later justified the nuclear programme 
as "inevitable for the defence of the country". Read in their 
totality, all these statements suggest that Pakistan has nuclear 
capability but probably of limited dimensions. It has also 
loosely talked of an Islamic Bomb thus giving its nuclear 
programme an extra-regional dimension. 
  Perhaps for its own reasons Washington is exaggerating the 
extent of Pakistan's nuclear programme. By encouraging Pakistan 
to harp on linking its signature on the NPT with India's, 
Washington is trying to confuse the issue. India does not sign 
the NPT for its iniquitous character, not for any regional 
reasons. By now there is enough evidence that the five-nation 
conference proposed by Nawaz Sharif in 1991 was in fact an 
American cuckoo's egg deposited in the Pakistani crow's nest. 
The proposal died an early death although efforts are repeatedly 
made to revive it. 
  If Pakistan wants to consolidate its security, it should 
engage in meaningful talks with India without laying the 
precondition that the so-called core issue of Kashmir must be 
tackled before any meaningful progress can be made in other 
areas. Even in the nuclear area, bilateral talks could prove 
more fruitful than the present tactics which in effect merely 
serve the American policy of consolidating its stranglehold on 
yet another field of technology. In fact, Pakistan should join 
India in demanding a more equitable and just international 
regime when the NPT Review Conference meets in 1995.

  [Text] DERA BABA NANAK (Gurdaspur), 27 Dec -- Director 
General of Punjab Police [DGP], Mr. Kanwarpal Singh Gill, today 
said that the Inter Service Intelligence (ISI) of Pakistan was 
trying to allure the Sikh youths residing in the European 
countries to come forward to give a new thrust to the Khalistan 
movement. 
  Mr. Gill was talking to newsmen at the Border Security Force 
outpost of Rossay where he said that the Pakistan agency had 
also promised arms training and financial help to these youth 
for achieving their goal. 
  Mr. Gill said that for this purpose a few training camps had 
been started by the ISI alongside the Afghanistan border. He 
also disclosed that all those Punjabi youths who had gone abroad 
on fake papers had been contacted by the Pakistani agency and 
these people were being motivated in the name of Khalistan. 
  Mr. Gill disclosed that nearly five hundred youth living in 
Europe have fallen prey to this trap of the ISI and the agency 
was now trying to bring them to Pak for training purposes. 
  Replying to a question the DGP said that about ten group 
leaders of the militants, including Pritam Singh Sekhon, Lakhbir 
Singh Rode and Wassan Singh Zaffarwal were still living in 
Pakistan. 
  The DGP also announced that special recruitment drive would 
be launched in the border districts from next month to recruit 
youth to the Punjab police. 
  He assured that the youth fulfilling the required 
qualification and physical fitness test would be recruited. The 
DGP also expressed happiness over holding of the rural sports in 
the area, which was once known as hotbed of militantcy. The DGP, 
while commenting on the operation clean up in the department, 
said that more than six deputy superintendent of police and over 
thirty lower ranking policemen had been sacked for their 
involvement in various cases of corruption. 
  When asked to comment that banning of dharnas [sit-in 
strike] 
and demonstrations of the Akalis amounted to infringement of 
their democratic rights as they were the recognised political 
parties, the DGP said that dharnas, demonstrations would be 
allowed in the State, provided militancy is completely wiped out. 
  Responding to another question, he said that though all the 
companies of CRPF [Central Reserve Police Force], which were 
sent to other States on the eve of recent Assembly elections had 
returned to the State "but they have not been pressed into 
service." 
  Speaking on the occasion, the IGP [Inspector General of 
Police] (border range), Mr. D.R. Bhatti, dwelt on the new role 
that the State police had undertaken in the service of humanity, 
including promotion of sports and cultural activities. 
  The SSP [Senior Superintendent of Police] of Batala police 
district, Mr. Rohit Chaudhary, said that a number of steps had 
been taken to improve police interaction with the people and 
thus in the process shoulder a greater social responsibility of 
shaping a cleaner and stronger society. 
  A youth cell headed by the SP [Superintendent of Police] 
(Operations), he said, has been formed for implementing schemes 
for guiding the youths in matters calling for specific 
attention. The members of this cell are leading industrialists, 
college teachers and social workers. Camps at border towns to 
guide the youths on physical efficiency tests in the 
para-military forces and the police forces would be organised. 
The first camp will be held at Dera Baba Nanak on 7 Jan. to be 
followed by at Fatehgarh Churian on 16 Jan. and at Kalanaur on 
25 Jan.

  [Text] The Tamil Nadu Assembly has passed two bills making 
the chief minister chancellor of all the 13 universities in the 
state in place of the governor. Replying to the debate, the 
education minister, Mr. K. Ponnuswamy, allayed fears there would 
be interference in the day-to-day functioning of the 
universities. He claimed that it is well within the legislative 
competence and jurisdiction of the house to make the chief 
minister chancellor of the universities. 
  The Congress-I, the Janata Party, the CPI [Communist Party 
of 
India], the CPI-M [Communist Party of India-Marxist] and the MGR 
Anna DMK [M.G. Ramachandran Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam] 
parties have criticized the Tamil Nadu Government for violating 
federal principles and showing disrespect to the governor by 
bringing forward the bills. They expressed the view the bills 
would pave the way for encroachment in the day-to-day 
functioning of the universities.

<F P=106> [Report by Ismael Iraqi] </F>
  [Text] Kabul, Jan 5 (AFP)--A loose grouping of rival Afghan 
forces called Wednesday for the resignation of President 
Borhanoddin Rabbani, as heavy fighting raged through the capital 
for the fifth day. 
  "Rabbani should resign in the next 48 hours in order to have 
peace and stability in Afghanistan," began the four-point 
statement released in Islamabad. 
  The communique was issued under the names of Rabbani's main 
rivals Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, ex-communist 
militiaman General 'Abdol Rashid Dostam, and two other factions, 
calling themselves the "Supreme Coordinating Council of forces 
fighting Rabbani." 
  The other three points called for an assembly of mojahedin 
leaders to nominate a replacement for Rabbani, the establishment 
of an immediate interim government, and the appointment of joint 
commissions to run the Finance, Interior and Foreign Ministries. 
  The communique, released by Hekmatyar's Islamabad spokesman 
Mengal Hoseyn, also "welcomed" any delegations from Pakistan, 
Iran or Saudi Arabia to come to the embattled Kabul capital to 
evacuate those wounded in the bloody five-day fighting. 
  Factional fighting has plagued Afghanistan since the 
mojahedin overthrew the Afghan communist rule of president 
Najibollah in April 1992. 
  An Afghan Ministry of Public Health official Tuesday 
estimated that more than 1,000 people -- mostly civilians -- 
have yet to receive medical treatment for shrapnel and gunshot 
injuries. 
  Although the joint communique released in Islamabad implied 
it, Mengal Hoseyn was careful to distance the battlefield 
relationship between Hezb and Dostam's Junbish or National 
Islamic Movement. 
  "So far there is no coalition -- we are fighting Rabbani 
forces and Dostam is fighting Rabbani forces," Mengal Hoseyn 
said. 
  He said Hezb was fighting in many different parts of Kabul, 
including "in the vicinity of Bala Hissar," which is the ancient 
fortress guarding the eastern approaches to Kabul, and Dostam's 
main military post in the capital. 
  Bala Hissar has been under severe jet bombardment Wednesday, 
and it is believed that Hezb forces have joined with Dostam's 
defenders there in order to hold off an infantry attack by the 
Shora-e-Nazar forces of Rabbani's strongman, former Defence 
Minister 'Ahmed Shah Masud. 
  In coordination with retaliatory jet attacks on Kabul by 
Dostam's airforce based in northern Mazar-e-Sharif, Hezb gunners 
subjected the city to a fresh wave of artillery salvos Wednesday 
evening from their mountain strongholds in the southeast. 
  In this shelling, from Zamborak mountain close to Bala 
Hissar, the AFP office in the northern suburbs took a direct hit 
which caused extensive damage but no staff were injured. 
  This intensified artillery attack by Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic 
Party of Afghanistan], combined with the unexpected 
participation of Junbish's jets, is seen as a move to counter 
intensive military pressure from Masud's fighters. 
  The sound of light weapons heard inside the central city 
late 
Wednesday could be a sign of the shifting frontlines, and the 
ever changing fortunes of the factions battling for control of 
the Afghan capital.

  [Announcer] The situation in Afghanistan is still reported 
as tense. Clashes between rival groups continue in various 
areas. Our correspondent reports from Kabul on the latest 
situation on the various battle fronts. 
  [Correspondent] The battle continues between the warring 
factions. According to reports from north Afghanistan, the 
forces of General Dostam, the leader of National Islamic 
Movement, have scored some victories in Mazar-e Sharif. 
  According to the same report, the joint forces of General 
Dostam and Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan] of 
Golboddin Hekmatyar have driven back from Mazar-e Sharif and the 
town's airport the forces under the command of Ahmad Shah 
Mas'ud, the chairman of the Supervisory Council and the former 
defense minister. According to reports from Mazar-e Sharif, the 
situation is at present calm. 
  Hezb-e Eslami sources in Charasiab said today: Fighter 
aircraft of General Dostam, in their first sorties from Mazar-e 
Sharif airport in five days, three times bombed the Bagram 
military airbase, 60 km northeast of Kabul. According to the 
same sources, as a result of the bombings, the fighter aircraft 
of the Supervisory Council were today unable to take off and 
bomb the positions of the forces of General Dostam and Hezb-e 
Eslami in Kabul. 
  A spokesman for Hezb-e Eslami in south Kabul said today: A 
helicopter carrying General Momen, one of the most important 
commanders in the Supervisory Council, was shot down near Mazar 
Sharif and Hayratan. The sources said: General Momen was 
killed in the incident. 
  In Kabul as well, heavy battles continue between the forces 
of President Borhanoddin Rabbani and the joint forces of Prime 
Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami and General Dostam. 
Each side is trying to penetrate the positions of the other 
but, on the whole, the forces of the Supervisory Council have so 
far had the upper hand in the battles in Kabul. 
  In Kabul, forces loyal to Mr. Borhanoddin Rabbani, who are 
being supported by forces of Rasul Sayyaf's Hezb-e Ettehad-e 
Eslami-e, enjoy the control of the capital's key political and 
governmental centres. 
  Meanwhile, for the fifth consecutive day, battles are still 
in progress for the capture of positions held by forces of 
Jonbesh-e Melli-Eslami [Islamic-National Movement] in a 
residential complex in southeast Kabul -- known as Microryan -- 
the Bala-Hesar heights, the Maranjan hill, and also parts of the 
Kabul airports. At the same time, the joint forces of General 
Dostam and Hezb-e Eslami are trying to approach the Kabul 
airport from two directions. 
  Battles in Kabul have killed or wounded hundreds, and have 
left many people homeless. The people of Kabul in general are 
facing a very grave situation. 
  Amid all this, the embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
in 
Kabul has intensified its efforts to mediate between the warring 
factions. In an interview today, the Islamic Republic of Iran's 
ambassador to Kabul said: We have managed to meet a number of 
leaders and senior representatives of Afghanistan's Jihadi 
parties and political groups, including Mr. Golboddin Hekmatyar, 
and a senior representative of the Supervisory Council. Through 
these meetings, we have prepared the ground for the 
establishment of a ceasefire in Kabul. 
  [Announcer] According to our correspondent's report, the 
Kabul airport was this morning brought under the full control of 
the Defense Ministry forces. On the basis of this report, in 
today's battles in Kabul airport, the forces of Ahmad Shah 
Mas'ud captured 40 fighters loyal to General Dostam.

  [Text] The Hezb-e-Eslami Afghanistan has expressed surprise 
at the Foreign Office claim that the Hezb was not among the 
parties fighting against President Prof. Borhanoddin Rabbani in 
Kabul. 
  A senior Hezb spokesman Nawab Saleem while commenting on the 
foreign Office statement, said in Peshawar on Wednesday that the 
claim was not understandable. "It is rank unawareness of the 
realities," Saleem said. 
  A Foreign Office spokesman told newsmen in Islamabad on 
Wednesday that the Hezb-e-Eslami was not taking part in the 
current war in Kabul. The spokesman further said that fighting 
was continuing between the forces of Commander Ahmed Shah Mas'ud 
and Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostam. 
  The Hezb spokesman said that the statement was in clash with 
the previous impartial stand of Islamabad on the Afghan issue. 
"The fact of the matter is that the Hezb was attacked by the 
Rabbani forces and Shoora-e-Nazar in Kabul without any 
provocation." Saleem said, adding, "the Hezb had to retaliate in 
its defence. 
  The other forces, who were already fed up with the 
dictatorial policies of Rabbani and Mas'ud, also took up arms to 
get rid of such a rule, Saleem explained. He said that his 
party was not able to understand the motive behind the statement 
against the Hezb-e-Eslami.

  [Text] Peshawar--The most violent fighting that the Afghan 
capital has seen in six months continued yesterday. The 
belligerent parties used heavy artillery, missiles, and aircraft 
in the battles, which broke out day before yesterday between 
President Borhanoddin Rabbani's forces on the one hand and 
General `Abdol Rashid Dostam's Uzbek militias and the parties 
allied with Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami 
on the other. 
  Local sources spoke of "hundreds of dead and wounded" in the 
clashes, and medical sources were not at first able to broadcast 
an official count due to the continued fighting. however, they 
commented that 70 people were killed and almost 700 wounded. The 
sources expected the count to rise, especially since the 
president's side used aircraft to bomb Bala Hesar Palace in the 
capital, where Dostam's forces are concentrated. 
  Sadeq Tashkari, one of President Rabbani's aides, told 
AL-HAYAH that responsibility for the fighting lay on the 
shoulders of the Uzbek militias, which previously supported the 
Communists and hold strategic positions in Kabul. He said the 
Hezb-e Eslami and the Shi'ite Hezb-e Wahdat forces allied with 
it entered the battle at the side of the militias afterward. 
  The presidential official mentioned that President Rabbani's 
Jam'iyat-e Eslami forces, led by former Defense Minister Ahmad 
Shah Mas'ud, had been able to repel the attackers. However, 
Hezb-e Eslami sources strongly denied this and said the 
attacking forces had taken over major strategic areas in Kabul 
and that the fighting is concentrated around the Presidential 
Palace. Meanwhile, General Fowzi, a commander of Dostam's 
militias, said they had captured the radio and television 
station, the Defense Ministry, and the president's Central Corps 
General Headquarters. 
  President Rabbani day before yesterday called for a jihad 
against his adversaries. he described the current battles as 
being "a new stage in the jihad that cannot be distinguished 
from the past 14 years" against the former Communist regime and 
the Soviet forces that invaded Afghanistan to support it. He 
said the goal of the alliance hostile to him "is to defend the 
cause of former Communist President Babrak Karmal." He described 
the Kabul attackers as "Karmal gangs." 
  The Hezb-e Eslami responded with a communique yesterday 
carrying counter-charges against Rabbani for cooperating with 
former Communists in the current fighting in Kabul. 
  Tehran radio said the Iranian Embassy in Kabul was hit 
yesterday by several shells for the second time in the space of 
24 hours, and that there were no losses among its employees. 
Iran announced Saturday its "deep regret" for the new clashes, 
which have broken out in Kabul. It requested of all sides "rapid 
action to put an end to these battles by peaceful means." 
  An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman said that Iran "is 
ready to intervene and participate in putting an end to the 
clashes."

  [Text] Peshawar, London--The clashes in the Afghan capital 
intensified yesterday and Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar's 
forces continued their attempts to take control of President 
Borhanoddin Rabbani's headquarters. Hezb-e Eslami, led by 
Hekmatyar, distributed statements in the name of the "Supreme 
Coordination Council of the Islamic Jihad," which demanded 
"revolution against the current regime." 
  Sources close to Hekmatyar told AL-HAYAH that the 
"Coordination Council" is an opposition political front that 
includes, besides the Uzbek militias (led by General `Abdol 
Rashid Dostam), the Hezb-e Eslami, the Shi'ite Hezb-e Wahdat 
(supported by Tehran) led by `Abdol `Ali Mazari, and the Islamic 
National Front led by Sibghatollah Mojaddedi, in addition to 
other field commanders. 
  This [front] forms what appears to be a coup attempt 
against President Rabbani's regime, especially since the Hezb-e 
Eslami has disclosed its alliances and the parties supporting it 
under the banner of the opposition front. 
  Foreign correspondents in Kabul reported the opposition 
forces (particularly the Hezb-e Eslami and the militias) pounded 
Kabul with hundreds of rockets and continued attacks on the 
government buildings in an attempt to capture them. It was 
reported that the clashes caused more than 80 dead and 800 
wounded. 
  Until late last night, President Rabbani's forces, led by 
former Defense Minister Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, still defended most 
of the government buildings. The correspondents reported from 
those near the president that he is in the Presidential Palace 
in southwestern Kabul. The Hezb-e Eslami announced that its 
forces had come within 200 km of the palace. [sentence as 
published] 
  An opposition statement described the events in Kabul as 
"a comprehensive popular revolution in which all the jihad's 
parties and sides and the field commanders and the armed forces 
were participating in all parts of the capital." The statement 
said that these forces "were indignant at Rabbani's and Mas'ud's 
policies, which are contrary to Islam." The opposition added in 
its statement that "these forces formed a council to coordinate 
the Islamic revolution in Afghanistan and agreed on the 
necessity of eliminating President Rabbani without any 
reservations. This was announced through the news media during a 
call for the commanders of the mojahedin factions to meet 
quickly and agree on forming an interim government. If Rabbani 
refuses, we call on the Afghan people to support this movement." 
  Mohammad Sadiq Tashkari, the Afghan president's adviser, 
told AL-HAYAH that the president's forces "have been able to 
deal with the attackers in Kabul and send them back to their 
positions in Bala Hesar and Tappeh-ye Maranjan." Tashkari 
disclosed that government aircraft yesterday bombed Bala Hesar 
and Chehar Asiab (Hekmatyar's headquarters) south of Kabul. 
Tashkari charged the prime minister with firing rockets at the 
capital. 
  AP reported that the Uzbek militias continued to tighten 
their control over the Kabul airport, which was being fiercely 
defended by Rabbani's supporters. 
  Hezb-e Eslami and Jam'iat-e Eslami sources that AL-HAYAH 
spoke to reported that the two sides "have been able to bring 
more forces into Kabul, increasing the deterioration and 
bloodiness of the situation. Uzbek militia sources said they 
were able to capture the Jam'iat-e Eslami positions in the 
northern city of Mazar-e Sharif in cooperation with other 
mojahedin factions. Nasim Mehdi, one of Dostam's aides, 
yesterday told reporters that his forces had been able to do 
that with the cooperation of all of the mojahedin parties, with 
the exclusion of the fighters of the Ettehad-e Eslami, led by 
`Abd-Rabb Rasul Sayyaf. Mehdi disclosed that the commander of 
the Jam'iat-e Eslami, Mowlawi `AIm, had joined the allied 
(opposition) forces. 
  The official spokesman for the Afghan Embassy in Islamabad 
told journalists that President Rabbani's forces had been able 
to capture the Mazar-e Sharif airport, but Pakistani diplomatic 
sources resident in Mazar-e Sharif told Islamabad by radio that 
Dostam's militias control the airport and are in possession of 
the city. 
  Gen. Homayun Fowzi, the Uzbek militias' representative in 
Kabul, said that they want a change in the politicial system in 
Kabul to be a change that is acceptable to all of the 
minorities. Fowzi added, "A single district cannot control 
Afghanistan," indicating the district of Panjshir, Mas'ud's 
headquarters (the real commander of Rabbani's forces). 
  Afghan sources expect fighting to flare up today if 
weather conditions improve, since the Uzbek militias were not 
able to use their aircraft in the battles. The same sources told 
AL-HAYAH that if the weather improves, the militias, the 
militias will resort to air raids on the Presidential Palace.

  [Text] The president, Mr. Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari, has 
said that Pakistan attaches the highest importance to peace and 
security in the Indian Ocean, as the country depends heavily on 
the sea for trade, commerce, and other economic benefits. He 
was addressing the 60th midshipmen commissioning parade at the 
Pakistan Naval Academy [PNA], PNS Rahbar, in Karachi today. On 
arrival at the naval academy, the president was accorded the 
general salute. He reviewed the parade. The president gave 
prizes to the outstanding midshipmen. He gave the chairman, 
joint chiefs of staff committee, gold medal to Cadet Mohammad 
Amin Sharif, PNA dirk for runner-up to Midshipman Mohammad 
Waheed, and the sword of honor to Midshipman Rahim Akbar. 
Champion division and winner of proficiency banner was Fox-1 
Division. 
  Speaking on the occasion, the president said the Indian 
Ocean 
constitutes the lifeline of the world economy, as about 
one-fourth of international trade passes through it. He said 
Pakistan being a littoral state, its concern is perfectly 
legitimate; and inexplicably large naval buildup by any country 
in the region naturally and understandably heightens our worries 
about the security of our shores and the safety of our sea 
lanes. He said this concern can be allayed if the Indian Ocean 
is declared a zone of peace. 
  Congratulating the passing-out midshipmen, the president 
emphasized the need for a high spirit of patriotism. The 
commanding officer of the academy said that the highest 
professional training has been given to the passing-out 
midshipmen. March past and salute to the president by the 
midshipmen. [video shows midshipmen marching past and saluting 
the president]. Earlier, the president visited some ships of 
the Pakistan naval fleet. 
  Later talking to newsmen informally at PNS Rahbar in Karachi 
today, the president said that Pakistan had agreed to 
participate in the Indo-Pak secretary-level talks, as it 
sincerely desired the solution of the Kashmir dispute. The 
president said, moreover, it was a welcome move for Pakistan, as 
during the last three decades, it was for the first time that 
India had agreed to discuss the Kashmir issue. It was 
heartening to note that at least Kashmir was recognized as a 
legitimate dispute, the president added. The president said 
from Pakistan's view, it was a victory as at last India finally 
recognized that Kashmir is a disputed territory which needs 
ultimate solution. He said the resumption of Indo-Pak talks was 
actually a support from Pakistan to the liberation struggle of 
the Kashmiris, as it greatly values their just struggle. Mr. 
Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari has said that Kashmir issue is a most 
intricate issue and one should not expect immediate results.

  [Text] The special committee of the National Assembly on 
Kashmir was informed today that Pakistan's principled stand on 
the Kashmir issue was put across to the Indian side during the 
Pak-India talks. The foreign minister, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, 
while briefing the committee on Pak-India talks in Islamabad 
today, said that the talks focused on the Kashmir issue. The 
Pakistan side emphasized that India must take visible steps to 
reduce repression in the Indian-held Kashmir, including 
deinduction [reduction] of troops from the valley, release of 
political leaders, and their unhindered access to the human 
rights organizations and foreign governments. The committee was 
informed by the foreign minister that although the talks failed 
to achieve any results, the fact that Kashmir remained the focus 
of attention during the talks and acknowledgment by India that 
Kashmir was a disputed area amounts to a diplomatic gain for us.

  [Text] Pakistan has expressed disappointment at India's 
reaction to the Kashmir dispute and said that India is 
responsible for not resolving outstanding problems between the 
two countries. 
  A Foreign Office spokesman told reporters in Islamabad today 
that Pakistan has taken notice of Indian Foreign Secretary J.N. 
Dixit's statement that the presentation of Indian proposals on 
Siachen Glacier, Wullar Barrage, Sir Creek, and nuclear 
nonproliferation will depend on Pakistan's response to holding 
the next round of foreign secretary-level talks. The spokesman 
said that during his stay in Islamabad, Dixit pledged that 
proposals on these issues will be submitted within two weeks. 
But the Indian foreign secretary said at a news briefing 
yesterday that the presentation of Indian proposals will depend 
on Pakistan's response to holding the next round of talks 
between foreign secretaries within four months. The spokesman 
said all these problems -- Siachen, Wullar Barrage, Sir Creek, 
nuclear proliferation, and Kashmir -- were created by India. He 
added that if India puts forward proposals to solve the problems 
that it has created, how can this be described as a liberal 
concession to Pakistan? The spokesman said the latest Indian 
statements confirm Pakistan's view that India has remained 
intransigent on the core issue of Kashmir. 
  Answering a question, the spokesman said that Pakistan will 
consider how and when to raise the Kashmir issue at the United 
Nations in light of the outcome of the India-Pakistan talks.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Nabil Sha'th, head of the </F>
Palestinian negotiating team, place not given; by Ahmad Birru 
and Faridah al-Shubashi in the Monte Carlo studio on 5 
January--recorded] 
  [Text] [Birru] It was announced in Israel that the 
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on implementing the autonomy 
agreement will resume early next week. Is that true? Has 
Israel stated conditions which you have accepted in order to 
have the negotiations resumed? 
  [Sha'th] We will return to the negotiating table, most 
probably early next week without any preconditions and without 
any new additions to what we are committed to. We are committed 
to the agreement which we signed in Washington. No doubt there 
has been progress in the negotiations over the past three 
months. We will all benefit from this progress in returning to 
the negotiations to reach an agreement. In any case, we have 
passed the storm which Israel has created over an agreement that 
was not reached in Cairo. It was a working paper on which 
President Yasir 'Arafat and Prime Minister Rabin added their 
comments. We are returning to the negotiations without any 
preconditions. 
  [Al-Shubashi] How was it possible for Israel to go back on 
that document which it called the Cairo agreement? 
  [Sha'th] In fact, we have not used all our cards. I have not 
published the hand-written agreement which the Israelis wrote 
and then thoroughly amended, and again changed later. I have 
not published the paper which we received from Rabin which 
includes reservations that are no fewer than 'Arafat's 
reservations because we do not want to escalate the situation. 
However, we faced them with what had happened. No doubt, the 
brother Minister 'Amr Musa helped us and was a witness to 
everything when he said: There was no agreement, there were 
working papers and the leaders had to comment on them. That is 
what Israel returned to at last. 
  [Birru] Has there been any progress concerning points of 
difference, especially crossings and the Jericho area? 
  [Sha'th] In fact, closer views were realized in Cairo, Oslo, 
and Paris negotiations. But what spoiled the broth was changing 
this progress into a claim that a final agreement was reached. 
If they said progress was achieved then we would have happily 
agreed with them, but now we have to go back to the negotiations 
to place all that we have on the table. We do not want to go 
back on any progress that has been realized. We want to 
negotiate on what we have not agreed on. 
  [Al-Shubashi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, both of you have agreed to 
defer the question of Jerusalem. Meanwhile, Jerusalem is being 
Judaized daily. What can the Palestinians do to stop this 
ongoing process of Judaization? 
  [Sha'th] As a matter of fact, there is nothing in what we 
have agreed upon that allows the Israelis to take advantage of 
time. Therefore, any attempt prior to a final agreement on 
Jerusalem and the rest of the areas of the West Bank, as well as 
the other issues which we have not discussed now, will sabotage 
the goodwill and trust that should prevail between us to arrive 
at a final solution. We will not sit idle toward any premature 
attempt. We can protest in various ways. We can also go to the 
U.S. and Russian sponsors, who signed this agreement with us. 
Everything should remain the way it is. Anything on which we 
do not negotiate now should remain frozen until we discuss it 
two years later. 
  [Al-Shubashi] Dr. Sha'th, Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat told our radio that withdrawal means withdrawal, and not 
redeployment. As journalists who follow what happens, we have 
read that the United States has earmarked funds to finance 
Israeli redeployment. Do we understand from this that the 
United States blesses redeployment, and not withdrawal? 
  [Sha'th] I do not think the Americans want to change or 
amend this agreement. The opposite is true. However, we should 
distinguish between what we agreed upon in Gaza and Jericho and 
what we agreed upon in the rest of the West Bank, which is 
called redeployment. Any funds that Israel will have to pay 
will be as a result of redeployment and not withdrawal from Gaza 
and Jericho. They will have only small forces in Gaza and 
Jericho to defend the settlements from within. But the real 
redeployment will happen in the rest of the West Bank. 
  [Al-Shubashi] Is there a plan to have a future agreement on 
the future of the settlements inside the Gaza Strip? 
  [Sha'th] The settlements are the same as Jerusalem and the 
return of the 1948 refugees. The final status of these 
questions has been deferred to the final negotiations to be held 
within two years. 
  [Al-Shubashi] The fact that the settlements will remain in 
Gaza requires Israeli forces to protect them, because Israel 
insists that the security of the settlements should be in its 
own hands. How will this problem be resolved? 
  [Sha'th] The problem is already solved because the agreement 
we signed in Washington states that Israel is responsible for 
the security of the settlements. However, the disagreement is 
about the security belt that surrounds the settlements. We have 
agreed after long negotiations that protecting the security of 
the settlements will be from inside and not outside the 
settlements. The negotiations are now about the security 
framework of these settlements. This is because we think there 
is enough territory usurped by Israel for the settlement 
activity to station any small force over there without a need 
for any further territory. 
  [Birru] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, thank you. 
  [Sha'th] You are welcome.

  [Text] The Egyptian Interior Ministry briefed the Arab 
Human Rights Organization [AHRO) on the results of the searches 
for and investigations into the disappearance of former Libyan 
Foreign Minister Mansur al-Kikhya, who was reported missing more 
than three weeks ago. 
  After meeting with Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi 
yesterday, 
AHRO Secretary General Muhammad Fa'iq said that the Interior 
Ministry has formed 10 search teams to find decisive information 
about al-Kikhya's whereabouts. The Investigations are 
continuing. Fa'iq said that he believed the Egyptian security 
authorities are showing real concern about al-Kikhya's 
whereabouts. Fa'iq said the Interior Minister told him that 
President Mubarak is personally interested in this issue and 
that Mubarak is regularly updated on the progress of the 
investigations. 
  Fa'iq will leave for Beirut in two days to attend the 
extraordinary meeting of the AHRO Executive Committee on 7 
January. The Executive Committee will discuss the details of 
al-Kikhya's disappearance, unravel the ambiguity surrounding his 
fate, and define the steps that should be taken to secure his 
safety. Fa'iq said the AHRO will discuss the formation of a 
higher national committee to secure the safety of al-Kikhya and 
the safety of political refugees in general.

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Political Department head Faruq Qaddumi </F>
by Mu'tazz al-Damardash in Cairo "before Qaddumi's departure for 
Amman"--recorded] 
  [Text] [Qaddumi] Clearing the air between brothers is 
commendable if the intentions are good. We are going to Jordan 
because clearing the air is good. We view our brothers in 
Jordan as one people and one country, and our interests are 
common and interlinked. It is therefore impermissible for vital 
differences to exist between us. 
  As for the issues of economy and agreements, we believe that 
first, we must be on our territory so that we might reach an 
agreement. We have concluded no agreements over the past year 
or two because our land is occupied. This land must first 
return to its owners so that we can build establishments and 
have our own economy that can cooperate with other economies. 
  [Al-Damardash] 'Amr Musa said he expects the negotiations to 
resume soon. Can you tell us on what he bases his expectation 
and if there is any sign of such a thing? 
  [Qaddumi] Our acceptance of the Madrid conference means we 
accepted the resumption of negotiations. These negotiations 
have gone on for 22 months and we are still negotiating. There 
is no alternative but negotiations, because international 
changes dictate that all parties resort to negotiations for the 
sake of a comprehensive solution.

<F P=106> [Report by Fathi al-Barqawi] </F>
  [Excerpt] Tunisia -- Three topics were on the agenda of the 
PLO Executive Committee meetings over the past two days. These 
issues are: Relations with Jordan; the stumbling negotiations 
with the Israelis; and the internal Palestinian course. Yasir 
'Abd-Rabbuh, member of the PLO Executive Committee, spoke to 
AKHIR KHABAR following the meetings, which ended Monday [3 
January] afternoon. 
  Regarding relations with Jordan, 'Abd-Rabbuh said: The 
Jordanian and Palestinian sides agreed, during the meeting 
between His Majesty King Husayn and Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat on Thursday, to activate the joint coordination 
committees and to instruct these committees to be practical in 
their deliberations and to directly deal with the major issues 
that must be viewed as priorities. He added: Despite the delay 
in the work of the committees, we believe that it is not too 
late and that there is a possibility for avoiding such a 
shortcoming. 
  'Abd-Rabbuh said: It is obvious that the problem on our part 
does not lie in our hesitation in or refrain from reaching the 
highest level of coordination, but in the lack of progress in 
the talks to end the Israeli occupation of even a part of the 
Palestinian territory. Any agreement with sisterly Jordan will 
be useless and cannot be practically applied without ending the 
occupation. We reached an understanding with our brothers in 
Jordan that discussing future relations, particularly on the 
political level, depends on the establishment of a Palestinian 
entity on Palestinian land and on ending the Israeli occupation. 
He said: The relationship should be established between two 
independent entities on an equal footing. He added that the 
same thing applies to the economic and security issues.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in </F>
Tunis by Wolfgang Labuhn in Cologne on 5 January; 'Arafat 
answers in English, with superimposed German 
translation--recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] My colleague Wolfgang Labuhn had an 
opportunity this morning to ask Yasir 'Arafat in Tunis when the 
talks with the Israelis will be continued. 
  ['Arafat] It depends on the Israelis, and not only on the 
Palestinians. We are now expecting results from the Israelis in 
this respect. They appear to be insisting on a number of 
conditions that are far from the Declaration of Principles that 
we signed at the White House in Washington in September last 
year. We insist on the implementation of this agreement, on its 
accurate and honest implementation. 
  [Labuhn] What conditions has the Israeli side set? 
  ['Arafat] To take one example: According to the Israeli 
administration, the dimension of Jericho is 712 square 
kilometers. To start with, they offered us 27 square kilometers, 
which was then increased to 55 square kilometers. They want to 
control the access routes and border crossings, or, in other 
words, they want to put us into a ghetto or a Bantustan. But 
who would accept having to live in a Bantustan or a ghetto? The 
third issue is that the number of Jewish settlers in Gaza is no 
more than 3,000, and they insist on approximately 40 square 
kilometers for those 3,000 settlers, whereas the population 
there totals approximately 1.2 million, as you know. Can you 
imagine that this is fair? Could anyone accept this? 
Regrettably, I must say that they are demanding unacceptable 
guarantees. They only want to humiliate the Palestinians, and 
they do not want to solve problems or make peace with the 
Palestinians. 
  [Labuhn] Should these problems be seen as a package, or 
should they rather be solved step by step? 
  ['Arafat] I prefer to solve them step by step, because we do 
not want more than the accurate and serious implementation of 
the agreement. 
  [Labuhn] In your view, what problem is the most important 
one? 
  ['Arafat] We are confronted with these problems, and we are 
ready to discuss them in frank and open talks in the sense of 
the framework agreement concluded with Israel. 
  [Labuhn] Israel insists on security measures for its 
settlers in the occupied territories. Do you understand these 
concerns? 
  ['Arafat] They have no right to use this as an excuse, 
because we have accepted that in addition to our own 
responsibility in these areas, Israel can have full 
responsibility for their security. So this cannot be an excuse 
for Israel's position. 
  [Labuhn] Will the talks with Israel be continued this week? 
  ['Arafat] We hope so. 
  [Labuhn] When? In a few hours, days, or not before next 
week? 
  ['Arafat] It seems in a few days. 
  [Labuhn] The implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement is 
now lagging three weeks behind the agreed time schedule. When 
are you hoping to move into your residence in Jericho? 
  ['Arafat] It all depends on how the Israelis treat us, 
whether they continue maneuvering in order not to have to 
observe the exact dates.

  [Text] An official Palestinian source denied the Israeli 
newspaper AL HAMISHMAR report in its issue today that brother 
Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] had agreed to Israel's demands 
concerning the crossing points in exchange for Rabin's approval 
to expand Jericho's territory. 
  The official Palestinian source stressed that what AL 
HAMISHMAR had reported today was totally void of truth and that 
no contact had been made between Brother President 'Abu-'Ammar 
and 'Abd al-Wahab Darawshah [Israeli Knesset member]. 
  In its issue today, the Israeli newspaper AL HAMISHMAR 
mentioned that 'Abu-'Ammar had contacted 'Abd al-Wahab Darawshah 
and had asked him to convey to Prime Minister Rabin that the 
crisis could be settled by negotiations with Rabin's approval to 
expand Jericho's territory in exchange for 'Arafat's approval of 
the Israeli demands concerning the crossing points. This was 
claimed by Israeli Knesset member 'Abd al-Wahab Darawshah, who 
said that he had conveyed this proposal to Prime Minister Rabin.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Crossings First and Last"] </F>
  [Text] If the security of the State of Israel is given 
utmost priority by Yitzhaq Rabin and his foreign minister, 
Shim'on Peres, the diginity of the Palestinian people inside and 
outside the occupied territories must be at the top of the 
Palestinian negotiator's priorities both at present and in the 
future. 
  We say this because of the conflicting reports coming in 
from 
Cairo regarding the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and their 
faltering over the question of who should control the crossings 
leading to Gaza and Jericho. 
  It is clear that Israel is insisting through its delegation 
that full control of the crossings remain in the hands of its 
security forces, and that all it can offer to the Palestinians 
is a symbolic presence limited to formalities only. 
  This conflicts with the stipulations of the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement, which talks openly and clearly about a complete 
withdrawal from these areas and their handover to the 
Palestinian national authority and the security forces belonging 
to it. 
  Israel interprets the agreement as a redeployment of its 
forces in the Gaza Strip and Jericho -- that is, remassing them 
in areas remote from the overpopulated towns. And it believes 
that the security of Israeli settlements must remain in the 
hands of Israeli forces. And it is bans the Palestinian forces 
from moving close to these settlements or arresting any Israeli 
settler involved in terrorist actions against Palestinians. 
  This Israeli interpretation conflicts completely with the 
Palestinian interpretation, which understands the withdrawal to 
mean evacuating all Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho, exactly along the lines of the withdrawal from Sinai 
conducted under the Camp David accords. 
  If the Palestinians in the occupied territories welcomed the 
agreement and supported those who signed it, this sudden support 
was the result of their belief that it would lead to an Israeli 
withdrawal and the restoration of Palestinian sovereignty over 
the liberated areas. 
  And when we talk about Palestinian dignity, we mean stopping 
all the insults to which the Palestinians are exposed at the 
crossings at the hands of Israeli security sources, namely body 
searches, confiscation, and waiting for a long time under a 
burning sun or in unbearable freezing conditions. 
  What Israel is proposing in the negotiations is merely an 
attempt to keep the painful reality as it stands, on the pretext 
of preventing weapons and "subversives" from being smuggled 
through the crossing points so as not to threaten Israel's 
security in the future. 
  It is difficult for us to understand how the smuggling of 
weapons to an area like the Gaza Strip can pose a threat to 
Israel's security when the occupation forces are building an 
electronic fence along the strip's border. 
  It is impossible for those whom Israel calls subversives to 
smuggle tanks or heavy artillery through the crossings, which 
will be watched by the other parties. What could be smuggled is 
pistols and rifles, and these are already in abundance in the 
strip and will be part of the armament of the Palestinian police 
forces to assume security in the strip and Jericho. 
  Israel, which has always wagered on rejection, is in a 
dilemma as a result of the Palestinians' acceptance of the 
agreement, which is why it is currently trying to extricate 
itself from this dilemma by putting obstacles in its way, in the 
hope that the Palestinians will lose their nerve and pull out of 
the negotiations. For this reason, it refused to withdraw on 13 
December. For this reason also, it is making a big crisis out 
of the crossings issue. We do not believe that the negotiating 
Palestinian side has one option only, namely to stand fast and 
to adhere to the only positive aspect in the agreement, that is 
withdrawal. [sentence as published]

  [Text] A meeting between Palestinian representatives and 
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd at Orient House in East 
Jerusalem ended a short while ago. Our correspondent Golan 
Yokhpaz filed the following report: 
  [Begin Yokhpaz recording] The meeting between the seven 
Palestinian representatives -- including the PLO ambassador to 
London -- and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd ended 
without any declaration stating that progress has been made or 
that Hurd made some contribution to promoting the 
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Speaking beneath a PLO and a 
British flag, the British secretary said that the meeting was 
good and that in it, the parties discussed the future of the 
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. 
  Speaking at the conclusion of the meeting, Dr. Hanan 
'Ashrawi 
said: Britain plays an important role in the negotiating 
relations between Israel and the PLO. Asked about progress in 
the negotiations, 'Ashrawi said: Well, goodwill alone is not 
sufficient for the continuation of the Israeli-PLO negotiations. 
We need very serious, concrete, and constructive action in 
order to make progress. [end recording]

  [Text] Amman -- AL-'AHD -- A high-ranking Palestinian 
source in Amman has said that Iraqi-Palestinian relations are 
not in good shape because of Iraq's position on the peace 
process, which opposes the stance of the PLO. 
  It has been learned that these relations became strained 
recently after Saddam Husayn offered to let Palestinian troops 
in Iraq join Iraqi troops, something which angered Yasir 'Arafat 
and prompted him to delay the move of Palestinian troops from 
Iraq to Jericho.

  [Excerpt] Lieutenant General Umar Hasan Ahmad al-Bashir, 
president of the republic, has described the celebrations of 
independence day as something that should continue and should be 
strengthened. 
  In his meeting this morning with the media leaders, he said 
that the revolution's serious work to implement the principles 
of independence was what instigated others to adopt a hostile 
attitude in their dealings with Sudan, a matter which instigated 
us to be even more committed to our independence. In this 
context he pointed out that opening al-Tahadi [defiance] road 
was a confirmation of independence. 
  Lieutenant General al-Bashir stressed the need for numerous 
similar great projects in order to get Sudan out of the state of 
inherited poverty. He stressed the importance of constructing 
al-Hamdab dam, which will provide 1.250 million mw of 
electricity in addition to irrigation water. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Lutfi Shatarah: "Aden Rejects Sanaa's document on </F>
the Army"] 
  [Excerpt] Aden -- Yemeni military sources have revealed 
that the military commanders who came from Sanaa for a meeting 
with the military commanders in Aden headed by Brigadier General 
Haytham Qasim Tahir of the Defense Minister's Staff presented a 
document dealing with the current political situation and its 
various dimensions, particularly those related to the armed 
forces. 
  The sources said that the Aden military commanders rejected 
the document, which carried the slogan "prohibition of secession 
and condemnation of infighting," and called instead for a 
comprehensive dialogue on the future of the armed forces and 
ways of building that institution in a way that would keep it 
out of partisan, family, regional, and sectarian loyalties and 
make it the safety valve of unity. 
  According to the same sources, the document of the military 
figures who came from Sanaa offered three options to keep the 
explosive fuse away from the Army. They are: 
  1. The first option: the transfer of some adjacent units 
facing one another in some areas in the governorates of Ta'izz, 
Lahij, Ibb, Shabwah, Ma'rib, and al-Bayda' to areas to be agreed 
upon in the governorates of Hadramaut, Shabwah, Ma'rib, al-Jawf, 
and Sa'dah (border areas) in a way that would fulfill the 
state's strategic defense requirements, protect vital targets, 
and seal off smuggling routes in these areas. 
  The units whose transfer is required are: 
  A. The 3d infantry brigade (Ta'izz); the Labbuzah brigade 
(Kirsh). 
  B. The 2d independent armored brigade (al-Hurrah camp in 
Ibb); the 'Abbud brigade (al-Dali'-al-'Anad) 
  C. The 56th brigade (al-Bayda'); the 20th brigade 
(Mukayris) 
  D. The Mulham brigade (Bayhan); the 6th infantry brigade 
(Harib). 
  2. The second option: The merging of the abovementioned 
adjacent units -- that is merging each unit with the one facing 
it. 
  3. The third option: An exchange of camps between the 
adjacent units by having them replace one another, and the 
transfer of the 2d armored brigade from al-Hamrah camp to 
al-Dali'-al-'Anad camp and the transfer of the 'Abbud brigade 
from al-Dali'-al-'Anad camp to al-Hamrah camp. 
  The document also proposes that the political leadership 
give 
absolute authority to the defense ministry command and the chief 
of the general staff in determining the ideal size of the armed 
forces and in the reorganization and redeployment of these 
forces and completion of the measures for their merger in 
accordance with the strategic defense requirements and the 
homeland's higher interests. 
  Other proposals included return of military commanders and, 
especially, the defense minister to their posts in Sanaa and 
Aden, ending conscription, armament, and mobilization of units, 
militias, border guards, popular guards, and others, and 
cancellation of the measures already taken. 
  The Aden military reject that document and, according to the 
sources, see it a "military and political trap." 
  Responsible military sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT 
that 
the military meeting held in Aden last week flatly rejected that 
document and called for a general dicussion of the armed forces 
situation not just the circumstances relating to the current 
political crisis. 
  The sources confirmed that the military will resume their 
meetings today in the capital, Sanaa, on the basis of the points 
raised by the Aden military commanders at the previous meeting, 
which include the following: 
  1. Abolition of the Republican Guard (attached to the 
presidency), merging it with the armed forces. 
  2. Abolition of the military police and and keeping its 
tasks confined within the framework of the armed forces. 
  3. Abolition of the central security [force], merging it 
with the interior ministry and the general security [forces]. 
  4. Assignment of guards for political figures including the 
president, the vice president, and the other Presidential 
Council members on the basis of the importance of the country's 
political figures and also tribal leaders. 
  5. Agreement to move all camps out of the towns and 
provincial capitals. 
  6. The political leadership should leave management of the 
army to the military, which means giving the defense minister 
vast powers. [passage omitted]

  [Text] President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari has said that 
the Kashmir problem is a stumbling block in the way of durable 
peace and stability in the region. The president was talking to 
the chairman of All Party Parliamentary Human Rights Group of 
Britain, Lord (Eric Evory) in Islamabad today. The president 
said that the only way to resolve the problem is to give the 
people of Kashmir their inalienable right of self-determination. 
Referring to the gross violations of human rights in the 
occupied Kashmir, the president said that Pakistan would 
continue to utilize all diplomatic channels to awaken the world 
conscience against continuing repression in the occupied valley. 
Lord (Evory) told the president that the UN ability to help in 
the resolution of the problem has been stymied by the Indian 
reluctance to cooperate. 
  Lord (Evory) also called on Senate Chairman Mr. Wasim Sajjad 
in Islamabad today. The Senate chairman drew the attention to 
the fact that since the Kashmir issue has its roots in the time 
of British India, it is special responsibility of the Great 
Britain to influence the world opinion for peaceful solution of 
the issue. Expressing his deep concern over the situation, Lord 
(Evory) said that the magnitude of atrocities being committed by 
the Indian forces has no match in the past.

  [Editorial Report] Most Israeli dailies on 5 January offer 
extensive coverage of the Israeli negotiations with the PLO. 
They report that progress has been made and two sides are 
coming closer together, allowing for the probable resumption of 
the Taba talks by next week. 
  Jerusalem THE JERUSALEM POST in English, in a page 1 report 
compiled by Alon Pinkas, Batsheva Tsur, and news agencies, 
writes that "Senior sources in Jerusalem said progress has been 
made on several points, which were contained in the fax sent to 
the PLO." The POST details some of the controversial points. 
Concerning control of the Jordan River bridges the report 
states: "the compromise will allow for a symbolic Palestinian 
presence." On the issue of international supervisors at the 
checkpoints, "the PLO will accept Israel's refusal to allow any 
international force or observers to be present." Regarding 
Palestinian access to the Dead Sea the sides will agree that 
"the issue be further negotiated." On the issue of private 
land, the POST writes that "the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] -- 
in the areas which it controls -- will respect privately owned 
Palestinian land." 
  Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew, in a page A1 report by Aluf 
Ben, 
Gay Bekhor, 'Aqiva Eldar, and Gid'on Alon, reports on 
yesterday's fax and phone contacts between Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres and Nabil Sha'th, in which two issues were 
discussed: "How to define the Cairo understanding, and whether 
this understanding stands on its own or should be seen as part 
in a series of contacts. Israel has expressed willingness to 
soften its definitions and no longer demands to define the Cairo 
draft as an 'agreement'. 
  "According to political sources, the Palestinians are no 
longer referring to PLO Chairman 'Arafat's demands for 
introducing substantial changes into the Cairo understandings. 
This is construed as a concession to the Israeli position." 
  Tel Aviv 'AL HAMISHMAR in Hebrew, in a page 1 report by 
Avner 
Regev, reports that "last week PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat phoned 
Knesset Member [MK] 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah and asked him to 
tell Prime Minister Rabin that the Cairo talks entanglement can 
be solved if Rabin agrees to enlarge the Jericho area. In 
exchange 'Arafat will give Israel what it wants on the Jordan 
bridges." The paper goes on to say that Darawshah relayed this 
message to the prime minister. 
  Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew, in a report on pages 1 
and 15 by Shim'on Schiffer and Nahum Barne'a, states that 
despite progress, "Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin rejected an 
offer by PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat to meet on 15 January, a day 
prior to the Clinton-al-Asad summit in Geneva." 
  Senior political sources, who commented on this issue 
yesterday, said that "'Arafat requested a meeting with Rabin on 
15 January to reach an understanding on the implementation of 
the self-administration in Gaza and Jericho prior to the 
Clinton-al-Asad summit in Geneva on 16 January. According to 
many assessments, the Clinton-al-Asad summit could place the 
Syrian talks at the center of the political negotiations at the 
expense of the Palestinian track. 
  "It has further been learned that Rabin also rejected 
'Arafat's suggestion that they join Clinton and al-Asad at the 
Geneva summit." 
  The report adds that "the prime minister asked the MK's and 
ministers who plan to meet 'Arafat in Tunis to stop these 
private initiatives which harm the negotiations between Israel 
and the PLO'." 
  YEDI'OT also writes that "Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
yesterday reiterated his opposition to U.S. mediation in the 
current controversy between Israel and the PLO." Rabin, in a 
farewell party to outgoing U.S. Ambassador Bill Brown, said: 
"We cooked this dish together with the Palestinians, so now we 
will fix it without outside intervention."

  [Text] Cairo, 5 Jan (ANSA) -- The current difficulties in 
the Middle East peace process will be at the center of talks 
visiting Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta will have here 
later this morning with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, with 
the Italian diplomatic chief reiterating Rome's political 
support for the process as well as it readiness to collaborate 
economically. 
  Andreatta, who arrived here last night from his two-day 
official visit to India, is also slated to meet with Egyptian 
Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa who will brief him on Cairo's efforts 
to mediate between the Israel and Palestinians as well as the 
divisions within the Palestine Liberation Organization, where 
opposition is strong against Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's 
negotiating with Tel Aviv. 
  Among the economic projects Italy is ready to work on in 
favor of Middle East peace is the three-way projects between the 
European Union, Arab nations and Israel to build a 500 kilometer 
gas pipeline from Port Said, in Egypt's Nile Delta, to Sidon, 
through the Eguptian desert and the Gaza Strip, with an eventual 
extension to Tel Aviv. 
  Italy has been active in Egypt for some time through its 
national fuel companies ENI [National Hydrocarbons Agency] and 
Agip and has almost completed a feasibility study on the 
pipeline which will be then presented to the World Bank, the 
European Union and interested Arab countries. The plan deals 
with both the technical and financial aspects of building the 
pipeline which will initially pump two billion cubic meters per 
year, to later be expanded to six billion cubic meters. 
  Rome has been working for some time on this so-called 
"pipeline for peace" and it was recently discussed in Tunis 
during the encounter between Italian Head of State Oscar Luigi 
Scalfaro and 'Arafat. The project is viewed as a concrete 
example of the determination of nations most interested in peace 
and stability in the Mediterranean and which are ready to 
support, even economically, the peace process begun last year 
with the reciprocal recognition between the PLO and Israel, on 
the condition that it succeed. 
  The current obstacles to the peace process included border 
controls between the Palestinian autonomous regions and Jordan 
and Egypt, the security of Israeli settlements and the expansion 
of the Palestinian-controlled area of Jericho, which Israel 
intends as the city, alone, while the PLO wants to control the 
entire province. 
  The Palestinians also must deal with the problem of how to 
finance their administration of the autonomous areas and pay for 
a police force of between seven to fifteen thousand men.

<F P=106> [Mark Huband report: "Behind the Religious Mask of Power"] </F>
  [Text] "There is no such thing as an Islamic state", 
'Abd-al-Aziz Shiddu, Sudan's minister of justice, said, sucking 
on an elaborate pipe in the chill of his air-conditioned office. 
Black and white photographs of his bespectacled predecessors, 
mounted in a long line high on the wall, formed a visual record 
of Sudan's many ministers of justice. 
  "We are a people looking for an identity, and I believe 
religious values are a way of looking for that identity. The 
international community should realise we are living in a 
conflict. We do not deny that in such a state of armed 
conflict, there would be violations of human rights. This has 
been the case throughout the armed conflict since it began in 
1955," he said. 
  Governments in Khartoum were fighting the southern 
secessionists of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) 
before Lieutenant-General 'Umar Hasan al-Bashir seized power in 
a bloodless coup in 1989 and carried on the war. But Sudan's 
conflicts are widening beyond its borders. 
  While the government disagreed with Iraq's 1990 invasion of 
Kuwait, it supported Saddam Husayn when Operation Desert Storm 
was launched against him. This has strained Sudan's relations 
with Muslim countries allied to the United States -- notably 
Egypt, which also accuses Khartoum of supporting armed Islamic 
groups intent on destabilising the government of President Husni 
Mubarak. 
  In August the U.S. listed Sudan as a state supporting 
international terrorism, partly on the basis of its alleged role 
in Egypt, Algeria and Tunisia, and partly because of a suspected 
Sudanese bomb plot discovered by the FBI in New York. With the 
recent expulsion of Britain's ambassador, Khartoum has further 
closed the door to the West. 
  Africa's largest country has added international isolation 
to 
the ills of hunger, fear, oppression, the displacement of 5 
million people, and a war that has killed 1 million people and 
costs the government $1 million (680,000 pounds) a day to fight. 
  "We told the Sudanese that if they weren't careful they 
would 
be placed on the list," the U.S. ambassador in Khartoum, Donald 
Petterson, said. "They didn't heed that. They denied any link 
with terrorism, but the evidence we had from various sources was 
convincing." 
  Mr Petterson, perched on an old rocking chair in his 
topfloor 
office, has ample time to ponder Washington's declining 
influence over Khartoum. "I don't think the telephone is going 
to ring today," he said, looking at the silent instrument on his 
desk. 
  Unless you know the secret code to open the embassy lift 
door 
on his floor, the lift automatically returns to deposit you on 
the ground floor, where a 15ft fence encircles the building. 
  "With our relations so bad we don't have any influence on 
them. I don't think any Western country here feels they have 
influence," he said. 
  Ministers such as Mr Shiddu try to explain Sudan's crisis as 
a product of the war -- a 10-year conflict which has its roots 
in racial, religious and colonial differences between north and 
south. 
  Mr Shiddu admits it cannot be solved by the al-Bashir 
government, which came to power with promises of peace, 
development and security though not a word about Islamic law. 
Candour is the most disarming weapon used by the soft-spoken 
"radicals" who occupy government positions. 
  Superficially at least, the al-Bashir regime appears at odds 
with Islamic fundamentalist stereotypes. Despite the public 
rhetoric, there is laxity in the enforcement of strict Islamic 
codes. 
  "My husband wears more clothes than I do," Sumayya 
Abu-Kashawa, the secretary-general of the Sudanese Women's 
General Union, said. 
  "He is more covered than I am. But outsiders choose only to 
look at the females when assessing what Islam means while in 
fact here women drive cars and trucks and carry Kalashnikovs." 
  In 10 days in Khartoum, I saw only three women concealed 
behind full chador dress. The Islamic legal code was introduced 
in 1991, but according to Mr Shiddu, there have been no 
executions for hodoun crimes under sharia law. 
  "An Islamic punishment is purification, for people who want 
to be purified. This is something the West cannot understand... 
that a Muslim accepts to be purified, and a stoning or lashing 
is purification. What is cruel and unusual in Western 
civilisation is a dictate in the Muslim world," Mr Shiddu said. 
  "We are trying to do justice within the context of a social 
structure, which needs some understanding by the Western world." 
  Foreigners, meanwhile, are largely left to their own 
devices. 
"Foreigners here have a little man -- usually an Eritrean, it 
seems, who comes round the back door with something called 
whisky, in bottles which resemble those of Johnny Walker. It's 
not bad stuff really," one diplomat said. 
  "Even if we had the resources, we wouldn't harass people," 
said Baha' al-Din Hanafi. He is director of President Bashir's 
political department and the mainstay of Sudan's links with 
Iran, which has a large and secretive diplomatic mission in 
Khartoum. 
  "And even if the war in the south ended, I don't think we 
would reach the utopian goal of everybody abiding by the Islamic 
dress code. Instead we leave it up to society to abide by this 
dress code. 
  "The state will use the media and the mosques to encourage 
people and push them generally in that direction. 
  "But democracy is a relativism. We believe in an absolutism 
in some areas, because we are religious people. Sudan is not 
exactly paradise, but it's getting better," Mr Hanafi said. 
  In another of those bursts of candour he acknowledged that 
the government holds at least 200 political prisoners. But he 
denied the existence of "ghost houses", urban, high-walled 
villas where political prisoners are kept for months without 
trial or outside contact. 
  Paul Qaddum might disagree that things are getting better. 
He stood at the roadside, a jerry can and a long hosepipe at 
his feet, one of hundreds of petrol black-marketeers in 
Khartoum. His T-shirt proclaimed: "Success hasn't spoilt me." 
Eight years ago he was a farmer in the south, then the civil 
war came to his village. 
  Mr Qadoom gets up at 3am every day to travel 35 miles to the 
capital from the refugee camp where he lives. 
  "I buy petrol at 1,600 Sudanese pounds (3.50 pounds) a 
gallon 
and sell it at 1,750 (3.80 pounds). I make about 1,000 (2.20 
pounds) a day, which is enough to eat in the evening," he said. 
  "It's only a bowl of sorghum, or maybe a fish from the 
river. 
It's not enough for clothes or anything else, but at least I 
have a job." 
  The petrol shortage came because the government's radical 
Middle Eastern friends -- Iran and Libya -- decided in October 
they could no longer afford oil subsidies to Sudan. 
  Petrol is rationed at two gallons per driver per week. Buses 
are scarce and fares have soared. Civil service salaries are 
frozen, despite 200 per cent inflation. Sudan is no longer 
eligible for financial assistance from the world's main donors 
having defaulted on its repayments. 
  The weakness and failure of the government -- to stem the 
economic decline, find a solution to the war, or win over the 
majority of Muslims -- have left the way open for abuses of 
power. Life under the regime is increasingly entangled in a maze 
of deceit and self-delusion. 
  "In Islam, man is created by the hand of God. So man is a 
very important creature. So he must be respected," 'Ali 
al-Nasri, the chairman of the official Sudan Human Rights 
Organisation (SHRO), said. "The human being is of a sacred 
nature. So how can we say that human rights are abused in 
Islam. Not at all. In Islam, if a man kills he must be killed." 
  Mr al-Nasri, a London-trained lawyer and vice-president of 
the Sudan Bar Association, said the SHRO had received no 
complaints against the Sudanese army after investigations into 
alleged massacres of civilians in June and July 1992, during 
battles at the southern town of Juba between government troops 
and the rebel SPLA [Sudanese People's Liberation Army]. 
  A United Nations report on the incidents expressed grave 
disquiet. Mr al-Nasri responded: "The difference between us and 
the people in the West is that we are looking for the truth. 
Really, Sudan is very peaceful. The people in the West are 
working against the Sudan and they are trying to strangle the 
Sudan. That is what is happening." 
  Without the claim to be championing Islam, the government, 
burdened by its economic, social and human rights record, would 
have little else to offer. 
  That is not, though, the view of General al-Bashir. "Our 
guiding principles are constant and have nothing to do with the 
conflict in southern Sudan or the economic situation," he said 
in an interview. "On the contrary, we believe that these guiding 
principles address many of the grievances that have led to the 
conflict." 
  "When you try applying Islamic ideas, it could be that there 
are points of convergence between Islamic thinkers, and 
differences as well. You find different points of view, to the 
extreme right and the extreme left. Our way is mediation." 
  In Sudan's last multi-party elections, in April 1986, the 
National Islamic Front (NIF), led by Hasan al-Turabi, won less 
than a quarter of the vote. Mr al-Turabi has steered the 
policies of the government from behind the scenes since it took 
power in 1989. 
  Even within the conservative Muslim Brotherhood--which has 
been split since 1991 in Sudan -- there are doubts about the 
government's course. 
  "The majority of people in the Sudan are Muslims. So we 
don't need to impose Islamic laws on people. This can be 
achieved through negotiation and dialogue," Hibr Yusuf Nur 
al-Dayim, the leader of the Brotherhood in Khartoum, said. 
  "The Brotherhood believes Muslim leaders should participate 
in government. But to try to be the sole figure in Sudan is 
unwise, because there are so many different parties in Sudan." 
  Neither are religious figures necessarily at one with the 
government's supposed religious foundations. "Before you apply 
sharia you must create good conditions for the people to live 
in. Only if people then stray, when they have no justification 
for criminality, can you apply the rules of sharia," Shaykh 
Muhammad Hashim al-Hadir, the leader of the pro-Saudi Sunni 
Society, said. 
  "All this government has, to claim it's Muslim, is that it 
prays," another religious leader said. 
  The differences acknowledged by Gen al-Bashir are 
incorporated within his illusion of moderation. Dr al-Dayim of 
the Muslim Brotherhood experiences the reality: he has been 
unable to travel abroad without first being hauled off the plane 
at Khartoum airport and told to wait for a week while his visa 
is rechecked before eventually being allowed to go. 
  The same harassment is routine for the Catholic Archbishop 
of 
Khartoum, Gabriel Zubayr. 
  Dr al-Turabi, the man seen in both the west and Sudan as the 
power behind the government describes the country's pre-1989 
political parties as "jealous" of his success in luring people 
away from old political loyalties. 
  "Whenever there's a new wave of history, like the Islamic 
revival, there are always attempts to suppress it. Sudan, as it 
grows, is an Islamic model, and richer Muslim countries are 
growing a little bit jealous of it," Dr al-Turabi said. 
  "Our most serious problem in Sudan since independence has 
been the search for stable government. At one point we had a 
formal democracy ruled by tribal families. Then a military 
dictatorship. Because there is now a religious spirit, the 
military can't rule the government," he said. 
  The regime's Islamic veneer receives the same condemnation 
from opposition politicians as from religious leaders. 
  Sid Ahmad al-Husayn, the local leader of one of the main 
opposition parties, the Democratic Unionist Party, has been in 
"ghost house" detention in a converted Khartoum branch of 
Citibank for the past five weeks. 
  But Sadiq al-Mahdi, leader of the other main opposition 
party, al-Ummah, who was prime minister during the 1986-89 
multi-party era, is able to speak from the elegant villa in 
Omdurman where he has lived since his overthrow by Gen al-Bashir 
in June 1989. 
  "The main political parties were committed to Islamisation, 
but the Islamic programme had to be non-partisan and before it 
was implemented there had to be a bill of rights clearly 
defining the rights of non-Muslims," said Mr al-Mahdi, who lives 
under constant army and police surveillance. His sister is 
married to the NIF leader, Dr al-Turabi. 
  "The NIF, with its military allies, has really put aside all 
those principles... According to the Koran, there's no way of 
establishing Islamic authority by a coup d'etat, because 
anything that is based on compulsion is null and void. 
  "Only the implementation of the instruments of power in a 
very callous way has sustained the government in power, just 
like many other dictators. And because they have so isolated 
themselves from other political forces within the country, fear 
of reprisals from within is what keeps them together." 
  Mr al-Mahdi's accusations continue: "The country's welfare 
state has been withdrawn, and the savings have gone to security. 
The free market policy has so lost the confidence of the 
business community that $70 billion (47 billion pounds) of 
personal wealth is now outside the country. 
  "For the flrst time in Sudan's history, there is substantial 
southern support calling for self-determination, which marks a 
big political failure for the government." 
  Against this, Muhammad al-Amin Khalifah, a former army 
colonel who is now the influential speaker of the 
government-appointed transitional national assembly (TNA), 
argues: "Anybody is free to give us his ideas. If they are 
wrong we will reject them." 
  In Sudan, said Mr Khalifah -- who strongly endorsed the 
British ambassador's expulslon: "There are no assassinations. 
The people are very tolerant. You can feel free. We have no 
killing like in Algeria or Egypt." 
  This year, the TNA will become elected. Candidates will be 
vetted by an election commission. Officially, there will be no 
political parties, all having been banned since 1989. 
  "There's no political stability in a multi-party system," Mr 
Khalifah said. 
  But if any average Sudanese believed political salvation 
might lie in an Islamic option, material conditions must be 
eradicating that hope. 
  "Ordinary people no longer believe the NIF government is 
going to solve their problems," a former minister said. "They 
don't believe this is what Islam means. They know the NIF is a 
very efficient machine of oppression." 
  The government's determination to conceal from its own 
people 
who is really in charge confirms this sceptical view -- 
particularly its effort to avoid any suggestion that Dr 
al-Turabi has more than an indirect influence. 
  President al-Bashir said: "In Sudan, there is freedom of 
creativity, and everything is open to debate. There is not an 
Islamic establishment, and al-Turabi doesn't represent an 
Islamic establishment, nor are his religious views binding on 
people." 
  The president also denies the accusations of Sudanese 
support 
for armed Islamic groups elsewhere. "We don't meddle in the 
internal affairs of other Muslim countries, because we don't 
want others meddling in our affairs." 
  But he added: "I do believe there's a revival in all the 
Islamic world. There's a renaissance of Islam, and these 
countries are retarding this. We believe eventually that our 
view will be triumphant."

<F P=106> ["Special" interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by </F>
Shim'on Schiffer and Nahum Barne'a on 30 December; place not 
given] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Rabin warns PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat 
that his rejection of the agreement achieved by Foreign Minister 
Peres and Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas] in Cairo will result in 
Israel's viewing everything as open to revision. In a special 
interview with YEDI'OT AHARONOT, Rabin says: "I am willing to 
discuss with the PLO any interpretation of the Declaration of 
Principles [DOP]. I will not enter a debate on any 
interpretation of the agreement. 
  [YEDI'OT AHARONOT] Have the negotiations encountered a 
crisis? 
  [Rabin] In Cairo, they seemed to agree on a paper, which 
required the approval of Tunis and Jerusalem. We regard that 
paper as an agreed-on joint paper, and not as PLO people are 
trying to present it -- as Israeli proposals. The paper 
addresses Israel's responsibility for external security. It 
speaks -- as we did in the DOP -- of coordination on the issue 
of border crossings. For me, the main things in the crossings 
issue are: a security check of people; the inspection of VIP's 
and luggage; and the prevention of a mass influx into the 
territories of Palestinians who are not from the territories. 
  Right now, in view of what happened in Cairo, it seems that 
some PLO people view the paper as Israeli proposals. Meanwhile, 
Major General Shahaq and Nabil Sha'th sat down and attempted to 
put down in writing some of the agreements reached in Cairo. On 
Thursday [30 December], Sha'th sent us from Cairo a fax with his 
own formulation. I have not had a chance to study it yet, and I 
am not even certain that Sha'th's fax had the approval of Tunis. 
I believe that had the meeting between President Mubarak and 
'Arafat concluded in accord, Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
would have arrived here by now. There was talk about that. 
  I have made up my mind: As long as there is no Tunis 
approval for the paper which we view as an agreement, there will 
be no Jerusalem approval. Otherwise this paper will become the 
start of future negotiations. Unless there is approval from 
Tunis, everything we said in that paper will be open to revision. 
  [YEDI'OT AHARONOT] In that case, what is your next move? 
  [Rabin] The starting point is the two sides' commitment to 
the DOP. It has not changed. Both sides have a vested interest 
in adhering to it. Therefore, we will pursue the dialogue. 
There will be difficulties. I do not propose to wait with a 
stopwatch. Either in terms of days or weeks. Personally I 
think the Palestinians should have the same interest in the 
agreement as we do. Perhaps even greater. Israel can tolerate 
the current reality. We are in control of the territories. 
  What we have here is perhaps a Middle Eastern bazaar. 
Therefore, patience is needed. We will not give up on the 
vital things: responsibility for external security, coordination 
and partnership in border crossings, everything connected with 
settlement security, and Israelis' safety on roads. And on the 
other hand, we are prepared to let the Palestinians run their 
own lives. 
  [YEDI'OT AHARONOT] Haven't the negotiations with the PLO 
been your worst nightmares about that organization come true? 
Their inability to decide, their disrespect for documents, the 
extortion in the negotiations? 
  [Rabin] I knew from the start that they would not be an easy 
partner. I differentiate between the two things. Basically, 
the PLO has adhered to its pledge to stay away from terrorism. 
PLO personnel has been involved in three acts of terror since 
13 September, the most serious of which was the murder of Hayim 
Mizrahi. We know it for a fact that these acts were not carried 
out on orders from the PLO; in fact, they were against PLO 
orders. Therefore, I differentiate between their disavowal of 
terror and the Middle Eastern bazaar. I still believe that we 
will eventually arrive at the implementation of the agreement, 
even if it takes longer. We need patience and stamina in the 
face of terror. 
  [YEDI'OT AHARONOT] Do you think 'Arafat got cold feet and is 
trying to shake loose of the agreement? 
  [Rabin] I will not engage in speculations. I do not have an 
X-ray machine to test the intentions of the Palestinians, or the 
Arabs, or even the Israelis. I will judge the situation by the 
results and by implementation. 
  [YEDI'OT AHARONOT] Would it be true to say that 'Arafat is 
now personally blocking an agreement? 
  [Rabin] One thing is entirely clear: 'Arafat is the 
dominant figure. He is the decisionmaker. Also, I suggest we 
stop writing the PLO off. The PLO was written off many times in 
the past, and yet nothing has happened. 
  [YEDI'OT AHARONOT] Are you considering U.S. mediation? 
  [Rabin] Absolutely not. We do not need mediation. We made 
the Oslo agreement on our own, without mediation, and to a great 
extent, even without the knowledge of the Americans. The 
responsibility is ours. We will find the solution. So the 
Egyptians are helping a bit, but President Mubarak himself 
cannot replace either the Palestinians or us. The 
responsibility is ours. 
  [YEDI'OT AHARONOT] What do you expect the meeting between 
President Clinton and President al-Asad to achieve? 
  [Rabin] We are not committed to the agreement with the PLO 
only. We want to attain peace treaties with three countries: 
Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon. I will be glad to learn that the 
al-Asad-Clinton meeting may lead to another breakthrough. 
  [YEDI'OT AHARONOT] Is Israel holding any contacts with 
Syrian officials? 
  [Rabin] Unfortunately, there have been no meetings. 
  [YEDI'OT AHARONOT] In what state do you think Israel will be 
in a year, on 31 December 1994? 
  [Rabin] We will have a crossroads year in 1994. That year 
will decide whether the Middle East is headed for peace, 
security, and development, or rather to a stalemate which will 
eventually increase the danger of war. I think it is our duty 
and the duty of our Arab partners to adopt our view of the 
matter. [sentence as published] There will be no solution 
without common interests. 
  [Tel Aviv MA'ARIV in Hebrew on 31 December also publishes a 
"special" interview with Rabin on page 3. In the interview, 
conducted on 30 December in an unknown location, correspondent 
Hemi Shalev asks: "Do the security arrangements specified in 
the document satisfy you? You speak of Israeli security checks, 
yet according to the document, the checks are only 
half-Israeli." Rabin replies: "The truth is that there is oral 
stuff, in addition to the written one. I act on the assumption 
that the oral stuff exists, in which case the security checks 
are reasonable." Shalev then asks: "Does this mean that the 
paper was not all there was? That there were other 
understandings?" Rabin replies: "Other understandings on which 
there was consent, according to reports I have received." 
  [Asked later whether a meeting with 'Arafat would not be 
advisable, Rabin says: "In view of the experience of 12 
December, when big gaps between the sides were revealed, I do 
not want to hold another meeting that will reveal gaps, because 
another meeting between 'Arafat and me that does not culminate 
in an agreement will have a negative effect on our chances to 
clinch the matter."]

<F P=106> [Report by Hemi Shalev and Washington-based correspondent </F>
Avino'am Bar-Yosef] 
  [Excerpt] Sources in the prime minister's bureau yesterday 
confirmed that Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin is not enthusiastic 
about the idea of posting U.S. troops on the Golan Heights. 
  In a closed-door discussion held in the last few days Rabin 
also referred to the Palestinian desire for deploying U.S. 
forces at the border crossing points: "I do not want any 
American mother to cry on our account." Rabin adduced the 
example of U.S. intervention in Somalia, recalling the grave 
impact that the death of only a handful of American soldiers had 
on U.S. public opinion. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Alex Fishman] </F>
  [Text] Plans drafted by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
General Staff and relayed in the form of recommendations to the 
Palestinians propose linking the two self-administration 
regions, Gaza and Jericho, with three traffic arteries. Free 
traffic between the two autonomous regions is a part of the Oslo 
document and the Cairo draft. 
  -- The northern artery: the Erez checkpoint, Ashqelon 
junction, Bene Deror junction, Bet Lid Junction, Tulkarm, 
Nabulus, al-Jiftliq, Jericho. 
  -- The central artery: the Erez checkpoint, Kefar Silver 
junction, Re'em junction, Hulda junction, Latrun junction, 
Giv'at Ze'ev, al-Jib, 'Anatot, Almog junction, Jericho. 
  -- The southern artery: the Erez checkpoint, Ashqelon 
junction, Pelugot junction, Bet Guvrin junction, Tarqumiyah, 
Hebron, Bethlehem, Abu-Dis, Almog junction, Jericho. 
  The Palestinians prefer to build a new axis that will 
connect 
the West Bank with Gaza and be controlled by the autonomous 
Palestinian authority.

<F P=106> [Report by Alon Pinkas] </F>
  [Text] The PLO is in grave danger of fragmenting and is in 
the midst of a serious challenge to 'Arafat's leadership which 
threatens the continuation of the talks with Israel, said senior 
security and military sources yesterday. 
  In a periodic assessment submitted to the prime minister, 
the 
sources said that if the deadlock in the talks lingers on, the 
PLO will become paralyzed and Israel will have to contend with 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]. The sources added that the 
ongoing stalemate is adversely affecting Palestinian public 
opinion, which is now doubtful of the Oslo agreement and is thus 
putting Fatah on the defensive and strengthening Hamas. 
  There are all sorts of pressures on 'Arafat, emphasized an 
intelligence source: "From below, by the younger 
intifada-experienced local leaders; from central figures in the 
PLO inner-circles, such as Abu-Mazin [Muhammad 'Abbas] and Yasir 
'Abd-Rabbuh; and from the former Palestinian delegation to the 
peace talks, which is demanding a more democratic 
decision-making process." 
  A similar assessment was presented to the cabinet yesterday 
by the government's coordinator of activities in the 
territories, Maj. Gen. Dani Rothschild. 
  Military sources added that signs of a rift in the making 
are 
evident in Jordanian-PLO relations. The sources confirmed that 
King Husayn is "dismayed" with 'Arafat's reluctance to proceed 
with an agreement with Jordan. [The Jerusalem political 
correspondent of Tel Aviv HATZOFE in Hebrew adds on page 2 of 
its 3 January edition that Rothschild further told the cabinet 
that Jordan has been punishing the PLO for its failure to honor 
its agreements by banning citrus fruit exports from Gaza through 
the Jordan River bridges and by delaying the opening of 
Jordanian bank branches in the territories.] 
  Based on this information, Rabin told the cabinet that 
"Israel is in no hurry" to conclude a deal, adding that from now 
on, all understandings will be "in writing."

<F P=106> [Richard Beeston report: "Hurd Says PLO And Israel Risk </F>
Alienating Public"] 
  [Text] Jerusalem -- Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, 
has urged Israelis and Palestinians to get their peace talks 
moving again, warning that otherwise they risked losing public 
support. 
  Speaking in Jerusalem after meeting Israeli leaders and 
senior Palestinians from the occupied territories, Mr Hurd said 
he had emerged from his talks convinced that both sides still 
had a strong incentive to work out their differences. "They all 
see the importance of getting on with it," he said. "Unless 
people in Israel or the occupied territories can see that there 
is actual progress, as opposed to the repetition of 
declarations, they will lose trust in the process. It is very 
important they should not." Although he emphasized that Britain 
was not directly involved in the peace negotiations, he said 
that the Government was willing to help Israel economically and 
to assist the Palestinians practically. In particular Mr Hurd 
pledged that Britain was in favour of liberalising trade between 
Israel and the European Community. He said that today, during a 
visit to the occupied Gaza Strip, he would unveil a package of 
technical assistance to help Palestinians establish self-rule. 
  His visit has been dominated by the failure of Israelis and 
Palestinians to agree to the terms of their "land for peace" 
accord in the territories. Mr Hurd came face to face with some 
of the difficulties when he met Yitzhaq Rabin, the Israeli Prime 
Minister, who read out the entire contents of a fax received 
last week from the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Israel 
insists that the Palestinians reneged on earlier commitments to 
resolve three outstanding differences holding up the start of an 
Israeli withdrawal from the territories. 
  The Palestinians who met Mr Hurd complained that Israel was 
using unfair tactics at the negotiating table, and said that 
daily life for the two million Arab inhabitants of the 
territories had changed little since the signing of the peace 
accord in Washington last September.

<F P=106> [Report by Jon Immanuel and Raine Marcus] </F>
  [Excerpts] A man claiming to be a Fatah Hawk from the Khan 
Yunus refugee camp said yesterday he murdered two Israeli drug 
addicts in Ramla last Friday [31 December]. Three other Gazans 
also participated in the murders, according to a leaflet. 
  Fatah is committed to refraining from attacks on Israelis 
under the Israel-PLO accord. 
  A man claiming to be Ihsan Farid Qaysi, 21, told Palestinian 
reporters in Gaza that he left his ID card with the bodies of 
the two Israelis to prove he killed them. 
  Hayim Weizmann, 30, and David Bublil, 44, were found hacked 
to death in their Ramla apartment; the blood-stained kitchen 
knife used in the killing was left nearby. Police also found 
part of an identity card belonging to a Gaza Arab, who security 
services are still hunting. Nothing had been stolen from the 
apartment, and a leaflet taking responsibility for the murder 
was left there. [passage omitted] 
  A leaflet pasted on the wall of the Khan Yunus central 
mosque 
said that a group called "The martyrs of Ahmad Abu-al-Rish" 
killed the two in revenge for the death of Ahmad Abu-al-Rish, a 
Fatah Hawk. Troops killed Abu-al-Rish by mistake a few days 
after he had surrendered and was released in November under an 
amnesty offered to wanted Fatah gunmen. [passage omitted] 
  Fatah officials said opponents of the peace accord may have 
been trying to implicate Fatah in the murder of Israelis to 
destroy the peace process. 
  According to THE ASSOCIATED PRESS, Fatah officials in Gaza 
said they had issued no orders for any operation and any Fatah 
activist involved was acting on his own.

<F P=106> [Report by Hemi Shalev] </F>
  [Text] The United States has submitted a diplomatic 
demarche to Israel over the government's construction plans in 
"Greater Jerusalem" and over the intention to integrate Ma'ale 
Adumim with the capital. 
  The demarche, which is very unusual in light of the good 
relations currently prevailing between the Clinton 
administration and the Israeli Government, was submitted by U.S. 
Ambassador William Brown to Eytan Bentzur, the deputy director 
general of the Foreign Ministry. 
  The protest came after U.S. officials were amazed by a map 
given to Samuel Lewis, head of policy planning at the State 
Department, by Construction and Housing Minister Binyamin 
Ben-Eli'ezer several weeks ago. On the map, a circle was drawn 
around Jerusalem that greatly exceeded the city's municipal area 
in size. The map also pictured plans for construction between 
Ma'ale Adumim and Jerusalem, Ma'ale Adumim and Giv'at Ze'ev, and 
also between Giv'at Ze'ev and Jerusalem. 
  In reaction to the demarche submitted by Amb. Brown, 
government sources yesterday promised to look into the matter 
and convey a response to the U.S. Government.

<F P=106> [Report by Bill Hutman] </F>
  [Text] The Jerusalem municipal planning committee 
yesterday approved the first stage in the construction of a 
Jewish housing project near the Bet Orot Yeshiva on the Mount of 
Olives. 
  The committee voted 7-3 to allow Bet Orot to place a dozen 
mobile homes on land adjoining the yeshiva, in the Arab 
neighborhood of al-Tur. 
  The decision came after Mayor Ehud Olmert voiced his support 
for the controversial project. 
  Deputy Mayor Shmu'el Me'ir (NRP) [National Religious Party] 
said approval of the project reflects the new city council's 
plans to increase the Jewish presence in eastern Jerusalem, 
committee sources said. 
  Me'ir said the mobile homes would be followed by 
conventional 
housing, a position also voiced by Bet Orot officials in the 
past. 
  Approval was given against the recommendations of the city's 
planning department, which argued the land was earmarked for an 
Arab school. In an opinion presented to the committee before 
the vote, the department maintained the lot had to be rezoned 
for the plan to be approved, committee sources said. 
  Committee head Uri Lupoliansky presented a letter stating 
the 
department promised to find another site for the Arab school, 
signed by Jerusalem education department head Nisim Solomon. 
  But the planning department said no reasonable alternative 
site exists for the Arab school. 
  Me'ir insisted he knows of four alternatives sites, but 
declined to give their locations, sparking sharp criticism from 
Councilor Yisra'el Shulderman (One Jerusalem). 
  Despite heated exchanges, the plan was easily passed by the 
municipal coalition, joined by My Jerusalem's Yehoram Ga'on. 
The one Meretz and two One Jerusalem members voted against the 
plan.

<F P=106> [Report by Dan Izenberg] </F>
  [Text] The Knesset yesterday rejected a bill establishing 
guidelines for the granting of compensation to Jewish settlers 
leaving the administered territories. 
  Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur urged the Knesset to 
vote against the bill, in a debate over policy and approach 
which took place mainly within the ranks of the coalition. 
  It was the first discussion in the plenum by mainstream 
coalition MKs [Knesset members] that touched on the final 
settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute and the future of 
the territories. 
  "The supporters of this government and those who believe in 
it know we are not telling the nation the truth regarding 
withdrawal," argued Avraham Poraz, who introduced the bill. 
"They know we will not be able to preserve all the settlements 
in the long run. They all know it, so let us not be afraid of 
the Likud and the right. Our supporters know the truth, so we do 
not have to hide it." 
  Gur urged the Knesset to vote against the bill, warning that 
the controversy that it would trigger would endanger the peace 
process. 
  "The government is opposed with all its might to this bill," 
he said. "If we have to choose between the difficulties in 
drafting the bill in all its details and the political-human 
difficulties we face at this juncture in our history, I am 
convinced that we must give precedence to the proper and 
efficient handling of the negotiations. 
  "Even if it is true that in the final analysis -- and I hope 
we won't reach that point -- we will have to act under pressure 
and pass a law, I still say to you that in choosing between the 
alternatives, we must give precedence to the correct alternative 
in terms of achieving the sacred goal of peace and security." 
  Poraz originally submitted his private member's bill in 
March 
1993, almost six months before the Israel-PLO Declaration of 
Principles was signed. He wrote at the time that "when a peace 
treaty is signed, there is a high probability that Israeli 
citizens living or working in the territories will have to 
leave, as happened in the evacuation of the Sinai." 
  Poraz urged drafting compensation legislation now to avoid 
the "chaos" that ensued in the wake of the peace treaty with 
Egypt. His bill was based on the 1982 Compensation of Sinai 
Evacuees Law, while the evacuation of the settlers was already 
in progress.

  [Text] About half the public believes Israel should use 
only limited force or even abstain from using force to put down 
riots in the territories, according to a poll published this 
week by Bar-Ilan University's Institute for Strategic Studies. 
  About one-third of the public does not know whether to 
support or oppose the agreement between Israel and the PLO, 
while one-half does not believe the agreement will lead to 
comprehensive peace with the Arab countries. According to the 
poll commissioned last month from Modi'in Ezrahi, 60 percent of 
the public support negotiations with the PLO, which represents 
only a 46-percent rise since last March. 
  The poll further shows that 78 percent are either opposed to 
any withdrawal or agree to a very limited withdrawal from the 
Golan Heights. On the other hand, 16 percent support a partial 
withdrawal, and only 4 percent advocate a full withdrawal. 
  As for voting trends, the poll points to a drop in support 
for Labor and Meretz and a surge in the strength of Likud and 
Tzomet. Labor would attain 26 percent of the vote if elections 
were held today (compared with 35 percent in the last election), 
Likud would rise from 25 to 30 percent, Meretz would drop from 
9.5 to 5.6 percent, and Tzomet would rise from 6.35 to 9.78 
percent. 
  As for the agreement with the PLO, the poll shows that 14 
percent support it very much, 21.6 percent support it, 11 
percent oppose it, and 26 percent oppose it very much. Some 27 
percent said they both support and oppose the agreement.

  [Text] Likud MK [Knesset member] Ari'el Sharon escalated 
his ongoing campaign against party leader Binyamin Netanyahu 
yesterday, demanding that a new round of primaries be held prior 
to the next general elections. 
  Netanyahu was elected party chairman and candidate for prime 
minister when he won the Likud primary by a landslide last March. 
  Sharon withdrew from the race, but it was clear that he had 
not relinquished his ambitions for leadership and was only 
postponing his challenge. 
  The Likud rules make a new primary impossible without a 75 
percent majority. Sharon suggested this rule be amended. 
  He further argued that the primary result is "not valid or 
relevant any more because it was held at a very difficult time 
for the Likud. By the time new elections are scheduled, things 
will be even more different, hence the need to re-consider who 
is to lead the party to the polls." 
  Taking Netanyahu's leadership to task, Sharon charged that 
"the Likud is not prepared to wage any struggle and it has yet 
to even crystallize its own policies and alternatives. The 
Likud simply does not appear now as the leader of the 
opposition." 
  The remedy for this, according do Sharon, is that rather 
than 
entrust the leadership to Netanyahu, "the Likud be lead by a 
team."

<F P=106> [Article by Jad Salim] </F>
  [Text] Kabul--A lot has been said and written about the 
`Afghan Arabs,' those people who had come from numerous Arab 
countries to fight the communists alongside the Afghan 
mujahedin. Since then, these people's native countries have been 
calling them the `Afghans' and have been afraid of them because 
these Arabs are well-trained in combat by U.S. intelligence. 
When Afghanistan's jihad [struggle] against communism ended, 
numerous `Afghan Arabs' departed Afghanistan's mountains, some 
returning to their native countries where they joined armed 
radical fundamentalism and carried out some military operations, 
motivating local authorities to pursue them as dangerous 
terrorists. The others returned to Peshawar, Pakistan, which was 
asked to deport them as soon as possible. Some people say that 
Islamabad has met the demand and deported the `Afghan Arabs' to 
Sudan and Iran. Others say that Pakistan pushed them out the 
door only to open a window for them to return and that they come 
and go as they wish in Peshawar. What is certain is that a large 
number of these `Afghan Arabs' continue to use this city as 
their center, moving easily between Peshawar, which is close to 
Afghanistan's northern border, and northern Afghanistan. 
According to Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, military commander of the 
Jami'yat-e Eslami Party which controls power in Kabul, there are 
nearly 70-80 `Afghan Arabs' who continue to fight in southern 
Kabul side by side with his rival Golboddin Hekmatyar, the 
Hezb-e Eslami Party chairman and Afghanistan's prime minister 
who is not exercising his powers. Like Hekmatyar, the governor 
of Kunduz Province, in northern Afghanistan, denies the presence 
of these Arab combatants. To seek the truth, AL- WATAN AL-'ARABI 
has toured Afghanistan to look for these Arabs and has found 
them. So where are the `Afghan Arabs' now and what do they do? 
  One looks for them but cannot find them. One hears about 
them 
but cannot see them. One goes here and there and asks about the 
`Afghan Arabs,' and one is told, "Perhaps they are near Mazar-i 
Sharif and in Takhar and Tashqurghan. They have training camps 
there. But do not bother because you will not find them." 
  I headed for Mazar-i Sharif and to Takhar and Tashqurghan. I 
went around; I searched; and I asked. But there was no trace of 
any training camp. However, with great difficulty I found Hasan. 
Hasan is a 28-year old Arab, as he says when he is asked. But it 
is difficult for Hasan to conceal his Egyptian accent. Hasan 
talks to one gently and politely and explains his position on 
jihad, saying, "It is jihad for God and Islam against Islam's 
enemies." Hasan was asked, "Now that the Afghan jihad against 
communism has ended, what are you doing here in Mazar-i Sharif?" 
Hasan responded that jihad against communism has not ended 
because communism has not disappeared completely from 
Afghanistan, considering that "there are active and influential 
elements that continue to operate in the government and that 
control sensitive positions. If we consider what is going on in 
Tajikistan, our neighbor, we would become certain that communist 
is still extant and that it is trying to return forcefully to 
the region. So how can we end the jihad?" 
  When one asks Hasan about the training camps, one is told 
that they exist. But Hasan will reveal no more, because when he 
joined his group, Hasan promised that he would not disclose any 
details. All we have been able to learn from Hasan is that all 
the vast barren expanses are training grounds where training 
camps are set up by night and disappear by dawn "because we do 
not need buildings and we do not need tent camps to train in the 
use of weapons and to master offensive military strategies. The 
environment belongs to us. We may meet under a shady tree or 
hide behind a hill." 
  Very adroitly, Hasan refused to disclose the number of 
`Afghan Arabs,' their nationalities, or their ages. We asked 
him, "Do you not want to go back home? He answered, "Someday, 
perhaps soon. My country needs me and needs my knowledge." He 
departs, placing his hand on his heart as a sign of peace and as 
a greeting, stroking his black beard with the other hand in the 
meanwhile. 
  After a 24-hour search in Tashqurghan, I met with 'Adnan. 
Like everybody else, 'Adnan is masked and he wears the Afghan 
garb which consists of a shirt, a pair of pants, and a black 
turban. If Hasan's accent betrayed his attempt to conceal his 
citizenship, then 'Adnan masters all of the Arab world's 
accents. When he speaks, one decides one minute that he is an 
Egyptian, another minute a Palestinian, or perhaps an Algerian, 
an Iraqi, or a Libyan. His strange mixture of accents confuses 
one. When one asks him, "What is your citizenship, 'Adnan?" He 
answers, "What business do you have with my citizenship? I am an 
Arab and I struggle for what is right. My conviction is my faith 
and my faith unites me with my brothers, whatever their 
citizenship." 
  One then asks, "Why do you train when jihad has ended?" 
'Adnan answers, with all his features turning into a question 
mark, "Ended? If, and I say if, jihad has ended here, then it 
has not ended in our Arab countries. Right will triumph soon. 
God's word will be carried out soon, and it is for this word 
that we work. Do not try to get any clarifications or 
information from me. I have taken the oath to keep things secret 
and to remain silent. Do not look for others, either, because we 
are all faithful." 
<H5>  Algerian 'Abbas: I Am Libyan </H5>
  I left the province and headed for the city of Kunduz, 
carrying deep inside me a despair that was dragging my steps 
backward. But the thread of hope holding my curiosity and my 
desire for knowledge was stronger. Immediately upon arriving in 
the city, which is located 332 km north of Kabul, the capital, I 
headed for the office of Governor Qari Rahmatollah. I introduced 
myself and delivered to him a letter of introduction from a 
prominent political figure in the country. He welcomed me warmly 
and expressed his willingness to meet my wishes. 
  I told him I wanted to see 'Abbas, a name that had been 
mentioned in my presence by an official in Kabul. He is an 
Algerian who heads an Islamic organization in Kunduz which 
coordinates humanitarian aid to Tajik refugees. 
  At my request, the governor of Kunduz, who was my host, 
summoned 'Abbas. To honor a guest in Afghanistan, custom 
requires that a number of notables be invited to have dinner 
with him. So, the reception hall was swarming with men. As soon 
as dinner ended at about 2000, 'Abbas came in. He is a tall, 
brown-skinned, and no more than 35 years old. He wears a pair of 
pants, a shirt, a vest, and a black turban. His beard is also 
black but not thick, and he strokes it between one word and the 
other, as if seeking inspiration from it. Those present 
conversed, and I listened and watched without interrupting, 
convinced that my turn to speak would inevitably come. But I 
miscalculated. 
  'Abbas was undoubtedly aware of my profession and of the 
purpose behind my request to meet him. He spoke in general terms 
and avoided looking at me directly. From time to time, he gave 
me a side glance. Whenever I tried to catch his eye, he turned 
his face away, as if afraid that I would ask him a question. But 
I did not ask any until the others finished talking about 
humanitarian aid and about generalities, and also until they 
finished exchanging their courtesies. When I asked 'Abbas about 
his citizenship, knowing full well that he is an Algerian--a 
fact confirmed to me by everybody who sat in that hall and who 
knew 'Abbas very well--he flashed me a quick look and fired his 
words as if he wished they were bullets that could hit me, 
saying, "I am Libyan." He stood up straight like an arrow, asked 
to be excused because he was late for some important business, 
and departed with the speed of lightning, leaving behind tension 
in the air. 
  I remained seated on the floor. The rapid succession of 
developments paralyzed every move I had hoped to make, and I 
remained paralyzed until I was pulled out of my state and 
awakened by a guest who said, "What is the matter with you? You 
are as silent as a rock. You wanted to see 'Abbas. He has come 
and you have not asked him a single question." To justify 
'Abbas's assumption of a different identity, this guest started 
to criticize me and to accuse me of seeking out Arabs for one 
purpose only, namely to offend them. "Why do you want to harm 
them? Why do you harbor ill will for them? Why do you 
investigate their affairs. They are jihad people. 'Abbas, for 
example, has been here for six years and he speaks Dari like any 
Afghan. All he does is work to help the Tajik refugees." 
  "Of course," I said to the man, "but the Tajik refugees have 
not been here for a year yet. Besides, where does 'Abbas get the 
money to help the refugees?" 
  "How surprising," said more than one guest to me. "Why did 
you not ask him this question? We are not interested in the 
source of the money. What is important is the aid given to the 
refugees. 
  "But are you not worried for your condition from movements 
that perhaps conceal some unhumanitarian purposes behind them?" 
  "Do you not worry about us? We need aid. The Tajik refugees 
are a burden to us and our governorate is poor." 
  The following day, I asked to see 'Abbas again. The city 
governor sent an emissary to him, but this emissary returned to 
tell us that 'Abbas was very busy and that he did not have a 
single minute to spare. The reason was that during the night, an 
attempt had been made on the life of 'Abdol Ghafur, leader of 
the Tajik refugees in Kunduz. Armed men entered a home where a 
confidential meeting was in progress and opened fire from their 
automatic weapons. 'Abdol Ghafur escaped the attempt but his 
personal guard was killed. 
  I turned to Governor Qari Rahmatollah and said to him: tell 
me about the Tajik refugees and the problems you encounter. 
  Kunduz governor proceeded to tell me that the Tajik refugees 
(Muslims) have occupied the schools in he center of the city, 
thus compelling teachers and students to conduct their studies 
in school yards or under trees and reducing the number of 
students. The refugees have also set up large camps at the 
military airfield, in Imam al-Bukhara, and in Bagh Sharkat 
(sites around the city of Kunduz). 
<H5>  Training Camps for Tajiks </H5>
  When refugees started arriving in Kunduz, the people helped 
them. But then refugee numbers multiplied so rapidly, the people 
could help no more. So, a Higher Refugees Committee was formed 
of Tajik members and and it began to collect donations and 
distribute them to the refugees. This committee was followed by 
an Arab organization named the Islamic Aid Coordination 
Committee, which tends and provides aid to the refugees. The 
governor went on to add that this committee's activities are 
limited and do not exceed humanitarian objectives. Last summer, 
a number of refugee children and old men died because of high 
temperatures and lack of medicines. They suffer greatly because 
their life here is difficult. They also need foodstuffs. The 
Islamic Coordination Committee provides just one loaf of bread, 
i.e., 120 grams of bread, per person daily. This is not enough 
to feed a human being. 
  Kunduz is a peaceful city, according to its governor, and no 
problems will develop in it because the local consultative 
council includes members from the various parties existing in 
the region. The governor also said that he works ceaselessly to 
safeguard the city's security and that he holds a weekly meeting 
to examine and deal with the conditions. Despite these security 
facilities, nobody other than the Arabs has come to help the 
refugees. The United Nations is absent from Kunduz, and "we have 
appealed to the United Nations and to the Islamic countries to 
aid the refugees, and also our governorate which suffers from a 
different problem, namely the return of Afghan refugees. To 
date, Iran and Pakistan have evicted 700,000 Afghan refugees in 
the direction of Kunduz. The Afghan Government is unable to help 
and aid these refugees. This is why we have appealed to 
non-governmental organizations and why we have assured them that 
security here is firm and that they can operate without any 
fear. It seems that the first organization to respond will be 
Doctors Without Borders, a French organization." 
  I asked the governor about reports that the Arabs, who are 
active in Kunduz, have rejected the entry of any 
non-governmental international organization to the city. In 
response, he was content to say that an understanding has been 
reached on this issue, that humanitarian organizations must be 
invited, and that no obstacles must be placed in their way. I 
asked the governor if officials are getting more befuddled 
because Tajik refugees are replacing their tents with solid 
houses, thus confirming their intention to stay in Afghanistan 
for a long time? The governor answered that nobody is forcing 
them to stay or to return to Tajikistan, especially since they 
assert that the communists will kill them if they return, 
considering that these communists have already burned down and 
destroyed their homes. Moreover, Afghan hospitality and the 
Islamic faith do not permit officials to deport Tajik refugees. 
I left the governor and headed for Kunduz airfield. On the way, 
I saw a sign pointing to the office of the Islamic Relief 
Organization, i.e., 'Abbas's office. I passed close to it and 
followed a rugged road to get to the military airfield camp. 
  The camp encompasses nearly 1,000 buildings, some 
constructed 
of clay and some of lumber. Every building is tantamount to a 
number of rooms. Seven to 10 persons live in each room, of which 
one corner is set aside for cooking. I moved from room to room 
and from building to building, surrounded by a troop of children 
who looked at me as if I had just descended from Mars. I entered 
a wooden building that has been turned into a hospital. There, I 
met with Dr. Taleb Shah Faydzadeh, the camp physician who fled 
Tajikistan in December 1992 to escape death. Faydzadeh asserted 
that the airport camp alone includes 22,000 refugees and that 
there are nearly 40,000 Tajik refugees in Kunduz and its 
suburbs. I asked him about the living conditions and about aid. 
He answered with a choking voice that living conditions are very 
difficult, that youth and men can rarely find work in the city, 
and that aid comes from some Afghans, and especially from Arabs. 
What Arabs? "I do not know what Arabs. All I know is that there 
is a coordination committee that collects donations. Every 
morning, the Arabs distribute a loaf of bread to every person. 
Drugs are dwindling, and patients are increasing in numbers. 
Some patients are people who have lost arms or legs to mines 
planted around the airfield. There are five Tajik physicians 
here, and at times we enlist the help of the Kunduz hospital 
physicians." 
  [Salim] Where do you get money to buy food? 
  [Faydzadeh] Some young men are employed in construction or 
sanitation work in the city, even though they may have high 
college degrees. However, we prefer such work to returning to 
Tajikistan, where our lives will be endangered by the communists 
who have destroyed our homes and burnt our lands and property. 
  I had decided to leave the airfield camp. But an eight-year 
old child insisted, while holding my hand, on taking me to her 
family room. I went to that room and found seven children and 
two women there. I asked one of them: where is your husband? 
  "He went to the training camp." 
  "What camp and what sort of training?" 
  "I do not know. But he tells me that if he does not go, the 
Arabs will not aid us." 
  I did not know what to do when the other woman assured me 
that her son had also gone to the training camp, but that she 
did not know where this camp was located or who managed it. All 
she knew is that the camp's youth and men went to train in jihad 
against communism and communists. 
  At nearly 1,500 meters from the airfield, another camp has 
been set up for Tajik refugees. It is Imam al-Bukhari Camp and 
it includes 8,000 refugees. If two mosques have been built at 
the airfield camp for the 22,000 refugees, then five mosques are 
being built at the same time in the new al-Bukhari Camp. 
  In Imam al-Bukhari, old men and a few young men are busy 
building a hospital and the five mosques. Anybody you ask at 
this camp will tell you that the youth have gone to train for 
jihad. But nobody will tell you the location of the training 
camp, the duration of training, or the people in charge of this 
"profession." When one asks about aid, the answer given is, 
"They are the Arabs. They give us food and materials to build 
our tents and the mosques." 
<H5>  We Want Weapons, not Aid </H5>
  From Imam al-Bukhari, I went to Bagh Sharkat Camp, where a 
model village is being built. The area is a vast barren expanse 
where every refugee selects his own spot and builds his own 
house on his own and in the style he wishes. 
  In Bagh Sharkat, I met with a 50-year-old man who had 
finished building his home's outer walls and who was busy with 
internal partition. As soon as he learned that I was a 
journalist, he started yelling as loudly as he could, "We want 
weapons. We do not want food aid. We need weapons to fight 
against communism in our country, Tajikistan. I am building this 
home for my wife and children. But I will not live in it because 
I will go to the jihad. I am training daily, and I can still 
carry arms. I have sold some property to buy weapons and I will 
sell the car I own for the same purpose. Moreover, the Arabs 
give us some aid and we also have some weapons hidden here. But 
we need more." 
  I asked this zealot, "Where do you train and what kind of 
weapons do you have?" His answer was a smile, after which he 
went on to talk about jihad against communism. Again, I asked 
about the type of aid advanced by the Arabs. He responded, "The 
Arabs help us and help everybody. Every morning, they come here 
and leave construction materials, lumber, and stones. We take 
whatever we need to build our homes. They also give us bread. 
But they do not give us money." 
  "Which Arabs?" 
  "The Arabs. I do not know which Arabs." 
  I became certain I could get no more information. So I left, 
having decided to head for the border area of Sherkhan Bandar 
near the Amu Darya River, which is 50 km from Kunduz and which 
is considered the border separating Tajikistan from Afghanistan. 
  There, the UN Higher Refugees Commission tends a refugee 
camp 
that includes 2,000 refugees who lack drugs, but not food. 
  Natasha, a nurse at this camp, invited us to have tea at her 
tent where she lives with her husband, who was absent that day, 
and with her seven children. She was in her seventh month of 
pregnancy. As soon as we sat down, Asad came into the tent. Asad 
was a dark-skinned man with piercing eyes. When he spoke, his 
thundering voice almost brought down the tent on our heads. 
Karim came in Asad's company. Karim was a 50-year-old man with 
features that were not as harsh as those of Asad. He spoke with 
fear in his voice. He turned left and right while speaking, as 
if looking for a spy or an observer hiding behind this or that 
couch. 
  Of course, I addressed all my questions to Asad, who 
proceeded to explain his current life to me: 
  "I came to Afghanistan in January 1993. I lived at the 
border 
camp of Imam Sahib initially. But I live at the Kunduz airfield 
camp now and I come here to Kunduz nearly every day to visit my 
daughter. In Kunduz, we get food aid from the Afghan Government 
and from the Arabs, as well as some aid from the Iranians." 
  "What kind?" 
  "Any kind of aid one can think of, and I will say no more." 
  Asad went on to assert that the Afghans have not asked the 
refugees to return to their homes, and that these refugees will 
not return as long as their Tajikistan is run by criminal 
communists. Rather, the refugees will carry on with their 
struggle, jihad, and political action in exile. Asad talked at 
length about the communists, whom he has known for 17 years. He 
has asserted that the refugees are accused of being radical 
Islamists and that the communist government uses this excuse to 
pursue and kill them. 
  I asked Asad, "How do you struggle?" He answered, "We meet 
from time to time at a certain place in Kunduz. We study the 
situation and determine the steps that we have to take. 
Yesterday, for example, I was present when the attack against 
leader of the Tajik refugees in Kunduz was made. The communists 
wanted to assassinate him, but failed. 'Abdol Ghafur survived 
but, regrettably, his guard was killed. We also train at various 
and changing sites on how to launch attacks. Several months ago, 
we launched an offensive from the border Imam Sahib point. I did 
not take part in it but 500 other refugees and some Arabs did." 
  I interposed at this point and asked him, "What Arabs? What 
are their nationalities?" After a moment's hesitation, he said, 
"Two Egyptians took part in the offensive. Regrettably, it 
failed and 300 attackers, including the two Egyptians, were 
arrested. The others managed to return." 
  Karim then interposed to tell me that he had gone into 
Tajikistan twice as a delegation member and that conditions have 
not changed there, as confirmed by messages received from 
Tajikistan. He said that, consequently, he does not believe that 
any refugee will decide to return home soon and that most 
refugees have resolved to stay and train in jihad. 
  I left the camp and took a tea break at the residence of 
employees of the UN Higher Refugees Commission before taking the 
road back to Kabul. At this residence, one employee said to me, 
"Look for a person called Ishaq in the capital. He knows a lot 
about the `Afghan Arabs.'" 
<H5>  They Went to Sudan </H5>
  As soon as I got back to Kabul, I did, in fact, start 
looking 
for Ishaq, and I found him in one of the ministries. 
  Ishaq said, "The Arab youth who came to Pakistan from the 
Middle East to support the mujahedin are divided into several 
groups. Some came for humanitarian work; others came to continue 
their studies, and most of those were Palestinian communists; 
and some came first and foremost for the purpose of jihad, and 
they took part in battles in south and east Afghanistan. 
However, they all fought alongside the mujahedin and they 
asserted that they were members of the International Islamic 
Conference. Because they had various political tendencies and 
opinions, they supported this or that party. Generally, they 
supported either Golboddin and his Hezb-e-Eslami Party or Sayyaf 
and his Ettehad-e Eslami Party. This condition persisted until 
the Kabul [communist] government collapsed. At that time, some 
`Afghan Arabs' decided that the jihad had ended and that they 
had to support the government. Others believed in Hekmatyar's 
principles, arguments, and ideas which stressed that Kabul's 
government was not Islamic and that, therefore, the jihad had to 
continue. These `Afghan Arabs' are currently fighting in Kabul 
with the Hezb-e-Eslami Party's forces. But they do not exceed 
100 in number, and some of them have been killed in battles." 
  Ishaq added, "Pakistan has deported a number of `Afghan 
Arabs' to Sudan, which is trying to get control over the 
remaining groups here in one way or another. One should keep in 
mind that several countries, led by Iran, Sudan, and Pakistan, 
are involved in financing and adopting Islamist elements. 
  "As for the U.S. intelligence agencies, which are eager to 
learn what is going on, they request reports on the Islamists' 
activities in Pakistan. But I doubt that Islamabad provides a 
true picture of the real situation." 
  I thanked Ishaq for this information. But another question 
kept occurring in my mind: "Why is the United Nations absent 
from Tajik camps in the north?" 
  I posed this question to a UN official, and he offered a 
clear answer, pointing out that there was no need to disclose 
his name. He said, "The United Nations is absent, especially 
from Kunduz, because it does not wish to become embroiled with 
the Islamists. These people are very active in the camps and 
they urge the Tajiks to struggle with all means. We are not 
prepared to enter into territory planted with human mines with 
the consent of Afghan officials, even though we are completely 
confident that our position suits the radicals and gives them a 
free hand."

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent in Cairo Shefi Gabay] </F>
  [Text] Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian delegation 
for talks on IDF [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal from the 
Gaza Strip and the Jericho area, told MA'ARIV in Cairo yesterday 
that progress was made on some issues dealt with in the liaison 
committee meeting in Cairo, mainly regarding the size of IDF 
installations for guarding the settlements, and to a lesser 
degree in relation to the size of the Jericho autonomous area. 
He added, however, that at this stage it is impossible to say 
that an agreement between the PLO and Israel has been attained. 
  [Gabay] What answer will you give the Israeli Government 
today following the unequivocal negative reaction of the PLO 
Executive Committee? 
  [Sha'th] In our answer, which we will send to Amnon Shahaq 
today, we will declare our intention to continue the 
negotiations toward achieving an acceptable memorandum of 
understanding regarding all the outstanding problems. The two 
original delegations will resume their regular sessions. 
  [Gabay] Does Yasir 'Arafat share your opinions? 
  [Sha'th] Certainly, because there is no return from the 
declaration of principles. In our meeting with 'Arafat, which 
has just ended, we decided that with goodwill we will be able to 
solve all the problems. 
  [Gabay] What, then, did the Liaison Committee do for three 
days in Cairo? 
  [Sha'th] We agreed with the Israelis not to publish the 
understandings reached, and a few understandings were indeed 
reached. You must remember, though, that no agreement or 
memorandum was attained. I hope that Israel will not leak the 
understandings, because I will construe any Israeli leak a 
breach of promise. 
  [Gabay] According to what you say, the Liaison Committee 
will not be reconvened in Cairo soon, as Peres claimed. 
  [Sha'th] The Liaison Committee, headed by Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 
'Abbas] and Shim'on Peres, convened this week only to unfreeze 
the talks, seeing that this is its job. It scored some 
progress, and now we will immediately start to deal with the 
details in a thorough manner. The Liaison Committee did attain 
a certain breakthrough. 
  [Gabay] Why did the PLO Executive Committee reject the 
memorandum of understanding reached in Cairo? 
  [Sha'th] The Israelis were mistaken to talk about an 
agreement in Cairo, when in fact there was no such agreement. 
The final agreement will be reached only after the committees 
end their deliberations. 
  [Gabay] Was progress made on the issue of border crossings, 
as the Israelis claimed? 
  [Sha'th] No progress answering the Palestinians' aspirations 
was made on this issue. Controversial points remain in other 
issues as well.

  [Text] The tough negotiations held yesterday between the 
government and representatives of the General Union of Algerian 
Workers [UGTA] included numerous trade union issues relating to 
the national economy in general and centered on workers' demands 
such as increasing the basic wage to 4,000 dinars. The 
government has given no details on these negotiations, which 
were held in closed sessions. However, the UGTA has given the 
government until 15 January to respond favorably to its demands, 
according to a statement released by the trade union. It seems 
that as far as these demands are concerned Abdelhak Benhamouda 
[UGTA secretary general] has not obtained satisfaction. This is 
at least what can be inferred from the tone of the statement 
released by the UGTA, which says that the negotiations have not 
given any results. 
  Over to Rachid Ould Mohand with a summary of the statement: 
  [Ould Mohand] In its statement, the UGTA says that the 
meeting between the government and the trade union has not given 
any results and that both sides stuck to their positions. The 
points of disagreement are the refusal of the government to 
increase the basic wage to 4,000 Algerian dinars in all sectors 
of activity in 1994. The trade union stressed its position by 
demanding an increase in wages if prices of consumer goods were 
to rise. The government expressed its readiness to create a 
national unemployment fund and examine other problems such as 
partial retirement [as heard], which is one of the trade union's 
demands. The trade union has set 15 January as a deadline for 
the government to meet all its demands. 
  According to the UGTA statement, the government has also 
pledged to set up a joint commission between the trade union and 
the Education Ministry next week to reexamine the law concerning 
teachers. The government also promised to pay 147 billion 
centimes to the Federation of Education Workers to cover the 
cost of social services and to open financial posts [as heard] 
for teachers suffering from work-related illnesses until these 
illnesses are included in the national list of work-related 
illnesses. Finally, the government has also pledged to pay 
teachers for the days they went on strike or to pay them back if 
their pay had been docked.

  [Text] Algiers, Jan 6 (AFP)--Algerian security officials 
have identified the man behind last month's massacre of 12 
Croats at Tamezguida south of the Algerian capital as Sayeh 
Attia, the EL WATAN daily reported Thursday [6 January]. 
  Security forces have arrested Attia's father-in-law, named 
only as Bouchakor in the report, charging him with sheltering 
the armed gang after the December 15 killings, and have 
recovered stolen goods. 
  Attia was reported to have led an armed band for more than a 
year and to be responsible for more than 200 attacks. He has 
been implicated in an assault on the Boughezoul barracks, 150 
kilometres (90 miles) south of here, which left 19 soldiers 
dead, EL WATAN said. 
  The 12 Croatian expatriate workers, employed by the Croatian 
company Hydro-Elektra, had their throats cut by a gang of about 
30 people, near the dam they were helping build 50 kilometres 
(30 miles) south of Algiers. 
  Last year, foreigners accused of cooperating with the 
Algerian government became the target of Moslem extremists 
waging war against the regime since the cancellation in January 
1992 of elections the now outlawed Islamic Salvation Front was 
poised to win.

<F P=106> [Article by Mustafa Bakri: "Legitimate Questions About the </F>
al-Kikhya Issue"] 
  [Excerpts] The issue of the disappearance of prominent 
Libyan opposition figure Mansur al-Kikhya has grown suddenly 
over the last few days. It has become the talk of the public 
and the intellectuals, overshadowing all other regional and 
international issues. The question that is being asked in every 
house is who killed or kidnapped Mansur al-Kikhya? [passage 
omitted] 
  The question is: Did Libya kill or kidnap Mansur al-Kikhya? 
At first glance, we can say yes on the basis that the Libyan 
regime has a vital interest in the disappearance of al-Kikhya. 
But after scrutinizing the situation, we find ourselves facing 
various possibilities. 
  First of all, it is illogical that Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi or 
one of his agencies would resort to this criminal act at this 
specific time, when the international crisis against Libya is 
boiling and reaching its peak and while al-Qadhdhafi is trying 
hard to acquit his country of the Lockerbie incident. 
  If we say that al-Qadhdhafi did it, after realizing that the 
U.S. Administration saw al-Kihya as a suitable substitute to 
take power and succeed al-Qadhdhafi in Libya, would it be 
illogical for al-Qadhdhafi to sacrifice his relations with 
Egypt? Al-Qadhdhafi has wagered on these relations even at the 
expense of disagreeing with some of his comrades in the 
Revolution Command Council. He has worked to cultivate these 
relations despite the regional events that have come between 
Egypt and Libya. I personally believe that al-Qadhdhafi was 
not ready to sacrifice his relations with Egypt, and 
particularly with President Mubarak, by kidnapping a Libyan 
opposition figure who has only his tongue and a pen. 
  Even if we agree that al-Qadhdhafi had decided to sacrifice 
his relations with Egypt and President Mubarak and did this 
deed, how could al-Kikhya have been smuggled out amid the strict 
security measures on the border between the two countries? 
Could al-Kikhya have been kidnapped from his hotel so easily 
and without an uproar or shouts for help? 
  In the midst of conflicting reports, we have forgotten to 
discuss the real beneficiary of the disappearance of al-Kikhya, 
particularly in Egyptian territory. We have forgotten Israel 
and the United States. Both countries have a common interest in 
striking at the Egyptian-Libyan relations, which have stood fast 
despite the strong winds blowing on them over the past few years. 
  If we concede from the start that the United States is using 
all means to subjugate Libya and that one of the basic methods 
to do this is to tighten the suffocating blockade on it and if 
we agree that Egypt with its status, prestige, and common border 
with Libya still represents a support for the Jamahiriyah, why 
shouldn't the United States fabricate an incident that would 
force the regime in Egypt to sever its relations with Libya, at 
the least, or push it into war to overthrow the Libyan regime, 
in the most extreme case. 
  The experience in Somalia was a lesson for the United 
States. 
The U.S. air bombardment of Iraq did not succeed in overthrowing 
President Saddam Husayn's regime. Only a ground war or an 
internal coups could change the situation. But because the 
United States does not want to dispatch its troops to a new 
swamp, their solution was to find another state that would do 
the job for it--especially since the United States has failed to 
change the regime through military coups. Certainly, the United 
States could only use Egypt, which, because of the size and 
equipment of its forces and its strategic location, could 
achieve what others could not. In addition, this would serve 
the U.S. and Israeli goals of starting a war among the sons of 
the nation to ultimately serve the Zionist aims. 
  I also believe that the search recently focused on finding a 
justification, especially after al-Qadhdhafi refused to 
relinquish his country's sovereignty and decided not to turn 
over the Lockerbie suspects. 
  The justification was Egypt's dignity. The Americans decided 
on a plan to kidnap al-Kikhya from Egyptian territory and to 
accuse the Libyan regime of doing the kidnaping. This would 
provoke the people to condemn the perpetrators of this act and 
then matters would escalate. 
  In fact, a state of resentment has spread among the masses, 
especially since some newspapers have jumped to conclusions and 
have started leveling accusations at the Libyan regime, 
demanding that it be disciplined and that Egypt's squandered 
dignity be avenged. 
  Thus the situation remains the same. Matters continue to 
escalate. Despite the Libyan denial and the Egyptian 
Government's belief that Libya is not behind this crime, some 
people remain determined to fan the fire and involve themselves 
in the scenario of the hellish U.S. game. [passage omitted] 
  Thus, we must warn against falling into this new trap, this 
wicked plan that is aimed at igniting the fire of war between 
the Arab people in Egypt and Libya. This is an abominable crime 
into which we must not be pushed. We must force those who are 
playing with the country's national security to stop and realize 
that the eruption of war under the pretext of disciplining 
al-Qadhdhafi is the U.S.-Zionist plan. 
  Despite all this, we call on the government to spare no 
effort in searching for the Libyan opposition figure and to 
remove the ambiguity surrounding his disappearance.

  [Text] Political sources have told AL-SHA'B that a meeting 
will be held at ambassadorial level between Egypt and Iran in 
the Syrian capital, Damascus, in the next few days. The meeting 
was arranged in the wake of Egyptian-Iranian contacts held at 
the level of charge d'affaires in the past few weeks to reach an 
agreement on the basics principles for a return to normality in 
Egyptian-Iranian relations. 
  According to the sources, the Iranian officials agreed to a 
proposed agenda of the meetings within a framework that would 
bring the views closer. 
  During recent meetings, Iranian officials submitted 
memoranda 
in reaction to accusations leveled at some Iranian elements by 
the Egyptian authorities that they harbor, train, and finance 
violent groups in Egypt. This issue will have priority in the 
upcoming talks. The second item on the agenda will focus on 
regional security issues, particularly Gulf security and 
relevant issues. One of the principles established during 
previous contacts was that there is no conflict between the 
Egyptian and Iranian concepts of regional security. 
  The sources affirm that Egypt and Iran have agreed to 
maintain secrecy on their communications and the topics under 
discussion until results are actually achieved.

  [Text] Cairo, 6 Jan (MENA)--Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi 
said that President Mubarak has given instructions to prepare an 
integrated program for the development of Sinai utilizing its 
various mineral, tourist, and agricultural resources. 
  In an interview with AL-AHRAM that will be published 
tomorrow, Friday, Dr. Sidqi affirmed that the president is keen 
to observe the strategic factor in the development of Sinai. 
  He noted that, over the next few days, the president will 
meet with the executive leadership to discuss the possible 
impact of the GATT agreement on the Egyptian economy. 
  The prime minister affirmed that the government will 
intensify its administrative reform efforts in the coming years. 
He explained that this reform means that negligent persons and 
those who cause a drop in production will be deprived of 
incentives. 
  Sidqi said that the state will make an effort to decide 
annual wage increases to cope with inflation, although its rates 
dropped to 9.4 percent last December. He explained that wage 
increases will be stipulated in a law that will be issued in 
mid- or late June, when the state budget is prepared. 
  Sidqi affirmed that opening the economy makes it easier to 
exchange products. He said that imports are necessary to export 
the surplus in Egyptian products. He explained that the customs 
tariffs were decreased to be in line with world policies. 
  The prime minister affirmed that the state does not overlook 
corruption. Every single case of corruption is reported and 
followed up, regardless of the status of those involved in it, 
he stressed. 
  Touching on the issue of unemployment, the prime minister 
said that the only solution is to expand production to provide 
job opportunities. He noted that the private sector offers 
increasing job opportunities for youth. 
  Responding to a question on government extravagance, Sidqi 
told AL-AHRAM that spending is conducted within the limits of 
the ministries' tasks and functions and the heavy burden the 
state shoulders in the services sector. 
  Commenting on the terrorism phenomenon, Sidqi said that the 
government is serious about its quest to obliterate this 
phenomenon and that it has allocated large funds for the 
development of shanty towns. Irrefutable evidence recently 
proved that the terrorists have connections with foreign 
elements, he said. He emphasized that dialogue does not work 
against terrorism committed by persons with criminal 
inclinations who are incited by local or foreign elements. I 
have to protect society against anyone who carries a machine gun 
or a pistol, he said.

  [Text] Libyan diplomatic sources have revealed that the 
fugitive Egyptian millionaire Tawfiq 'Abd-al-Hayy, who lives in 
Greece, was the main middleman in an abortive deal between Libya 
and Russia before the recent UN Security Council resolution was 
issued. 
  The sources said Tawfiq 'Abd-al-Hayy maintained close 
relations with the Russian ambassador in Greece and introduced 
him to Libyan officials. Libya was to pay Russia $1.8 billion 
immediately in return for Russia using its veto when the draft 
resolution to impose new sanctions against Libya came up for 
voting at the UN Security Council. The deal failed because 
Russia wanted the money paid before it used the veto. Libya 
suspected that Russia would take the money and consider it part 
repayment for Libyan debts to Russia and would not use the veto. 
Libya transferred just $65 million and the deal failed. 
  It is known that the fugitive millionaire, who is wanted in 
Egypt, maintains close relations with 'Abdallah al-Sanusi, a 
close aide to al-Qadhdhafi and the man responsible for his 
security. 
  ROSE AL-YUSUF has learned that the Libyan Council of 
Ministers recently submitted to Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi a 
memorandum demanding an investigation into all the funds paid to 
middlemen to solve the Lockerbie crisis without result.

  [Text] Nouakchott, 5 Jan (AFP) -- It was learned in 
Nouakchott today from a labor union source that the General 
Confederation of Labor of Mauritania [CGTM], the first 
independent labor union movement, was officially recognized 
yesterday. The source states that this legalization is in line 
with the provisions of the new Mauritanian constitution which 
recognizes labor union pluralism. The source adds that the 
recognition has occurred after more than a year of legal battles. 
  The CGTM is based on the unique labor union movement that 
has 
existed in the country since its independence, that is, the 
government-backed Mauritania Labor Union. 
  The leaders of the new labor union movement are mainly close 
to the opposition. They are suggesting immediately undertaking 
a large-scale campaign to install their sections in all the 
country's socioeconomic and administrative sectors.

  [Excerpts] A meeting was held today to discuss the various 
aspects of the final agreement reached on the Uruguay talks. 
  The meeting was chaired by Mr. Mourad Cherif, minister of 
foreign trade, foreign investments, and handicrafts. [passage

  After the meeting, Mr. Mourad Cherif, minister of foreign 
trade, foreign investments, and handicrafts, made the following 
statement: 
  [Begin Cherif recording] Since 1986, the member states of 
GATT have been holding the Uruguay talks. These negotiations 
ended on 15 December last year with an agreement which will be 
signed on 15 April this year. 
  It honors me to announce that the choice of the 
participating 
parties has fallen on the city of Marrakech to host the trade 
ministers' meeting during April this year. That was in response 
to a proposal by His Majesty King Hassan II, may God make him 
victorious. The final agreement of the Uruguay rounds will be 
signed during this meeting and the birth of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will be announced. 
  This choice is proof of confidence in and excellence of our 
country on the international sphere, and puts the seal on our 
encouraging and recorded economic achievements during a decade 
of structural reform. [passage omitted] 
  The success of the Uruguay rounds, God willing, will add 
(?100) billion dollars to world revenue until the year 2000, 
according to a study carried out by the World Bank and the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 
  The reduction in tariffs which the participating parties 
will 
give will enable Moroccan goods to enter foreign markets. The 
signing of the agreement in the city of Marrakech will give 
positive and important results to the Moroccan economy in 
general and our exports in particular. [end recording]

  [Text] Israel and the PLO have agreed to renew the Taba 
negotiations on Palestinian self-rule. They are expected to 
resume at the beginning of next week. The joint statement was 
released this morning in Jerusalem and Tunis. It says the talks 
will be held on the basis of the Declaration of Principles 
signed in September and the controversial Cairo understandings 
reached last week. 
  In Jerusalem, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said the joint 
statement means that the border issues and the size of the 
Jericho enclave are no longer up for negotiation. David Ze'ev 
reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Ze'ev] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres 
was cautious this morning. The bitter taste of crisis was still 
strong, but the foreign minister also spoke in no uncertain 
terms: Israel's right to maintain security control over the 
external borders to Jordan and Egypt from the self-rule areas 
remains intact, as does its objection to enlarging any further 
the Jericho area as was if not agreed upon, at least understood 
in last week's Cairo understandings. The joint statement was 
signed by Peres for the Israelis and by Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 
'Abbas] on behalf of the Palestinians. 
  Foreign Minister Peres said the Palestinians have learned 
that when Israel says it will not back down from its security 
needs, it means it. And this time, said Peres, PLO Chairman 
Yasir 'Arafat would be best advised not to overrule this joint 
statement. 
  [Peres] I think that if this will be done, we will lose 
credibility in the eyes of everybody. I was told that this is a 
decision that was taken by the action committee -- I do not know 
exactly the name of the institution -- and it is collective 
responsibility. 
  [Ze'ev] This is only one stage. Now the negotiations have 
to resume in Taba. How far are we from the implementation of 
the Gaza-Jericho First accord? 
  [Peres] Depends upon the amount of difficulties we may 
encounter as we go along. If it will go smoothly, it can be 
done in weeks. If we shall again encounter some very 
complicated issues, this will take more time. But I believe 
that all of us intend to work continuously so we shall really 
arrive at a conclusion at the earliest possible date. The land 
is not burning. We are not operating under fire. We are 
operating under reason. 
  [Ze'ev] There is room for some maneuvering. Foreign 
Minister Peres said Israel has agreed to the PLO's demand for 
what were described as stylistic changes to the Cairo 
understandings, but otherwise on the agenda, said Peres, will be 
the transfer of civilian authorities in a number of areas; 
security on the roads; and the details concerning the size and 
authority of the Palestinian council that will be in place to 
supervise matters once the self-rule arrangement is implemented. 
The foreign minister said he believes the existing difficulties 
could be resolved, but he preferred not to project whether 
implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First arrangement will be 
completed on schedule by April 13th. [end recording]

General Amnon Shahaq, will discuss the two drafts Israel and the 
PLO have formulated. Several of the disputed issues in the 
drafts are not at all simple: For example, control over travel 
axes in Gaza, the size and authority of the Palestinian council, 
the manner in which civilian authority will be transferred, and 
other issues. [passage omitted] 
  A senior political source said today that it is worth paying 
attention to the fact that the compromise formula makes no 
mention of the demands Yasir 'Arafat presented in the documents 
faxed to Israel over the last week. These demands deviated from 
the Cairo understandings and even from the Oslo document of 
principles.

  [Text] In Paris, Israel and Palestinian negotiators have 
ended the fifth round of economic talks, and progress has been 
reported. A Qol Yisra'el reporter says advances were made in the 
areas of agriculture and taxation; however, the Palestinians 
presented new requests in the area of banking. The Palestinians 
continue to demand their own currency and a central bank, and 
are opposed to Israeli representation at customs at border 
crossing points. The two sides say the talks are due to resume 
in 10 days.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Excerpt] Israel has proposed to Jordan that it lease to 
Israel those territories in the 'Arava that Amman is demanding 
be returned to its sovereignty and that joint economic projects 
be set up there. The proposal was raised at Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres' meeting with Jordan's King Husayn in Amman two 
months ago. 
  A year ago, Israel also proposed digging a channel through 
the 'Arava from the Gulf of Elat to the Dead Sea. The waters 
from the channel would flow over the disputed area, and joint 
tourism projects would be set up on its banks. Jordan is 
demanding an area of 320 square km in the 'Arava which Israel 
took over 20 years ago. Some of the area is cultivated by 'Arava 
settlements. 
  Political sources said yesterday that the size of the 
disputed area is still unclear because the Israeli-Jordanian 
border in the 'Arava was never authoritatively marked either on 
maps or on the ground. The agenda agreed on in the 
Israeli-Jordanian peace talks in Washington states that in 
determining the international border, the border dating to the 
British Mandate, on the basis of maps and the situation on the 
ground, would be taken into account. [passage omitted]

  [Text] National Defense Minister Abdelaziz Ben Dhia held 
talks this morning with his Turkish counterpart Mehmet Golhan, 
who started his official visit to Tunisia yesterday. During the 
meeting, the two ministers reviewed a number of issues of common 
interest, particularly those relating to bilateral relations. 
  After the talks, the two ministers attended the opening of 
the proceedings of the Joint Military Committee that will 
examine several aspects of Tunisian-Turkish cooperation in the 
military field. On this occasion, the two ministers highlighted 
the importance of this committee and stressed the understanding 
that always prevailed during its meetings. This, they said,

<F P=106> [Speech by President Ilyas al-Hirawi at a traditional annual </F>
reception for the members of the Arab and foreign diplomatic 
corps held at Ba'bda Palace in Beirut on 6 January--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Your Excellency, dean of the diplomatic corps: 
On behalf of all Lebanese people we thank you for the noble 
sentiments you expressed on your behalf and on behalf of the 
diplomatic corps for Lebanon and me. We thank you for the 
appreciation you expressed for the achievements of this country, 
which is striving to regain its health and sovereignty. This 
country will always remember your support for progress in the 
march to liberation, reconstruction, and peace. [passage 
omitted] 
  You are witnessing this country's determination to rebuild 
itself, despite the inherited burdens and the stormy political 
changes taking place around us and in the world. Convey to your 
countries and peoples that Lebanon has overcome the inherited 
ordeal, and is moving toward the future with self-confidence and 
faith in its rights. 
  The most significant achievements of the peace process were 
the triumph of the will of the Lebanese people in the struggle 
for coexistence, the development of a plan for salvation, and 
the return to a normal life. You have witnessed the unity of 
the comprehensive and firm national position in the face of the 
shocks to which we were subjected this year, beginning with our 
collective rejection of the Palestinian deportees, our unity in 
one rank in repulsing the Israeli aggression against the south 
and western al-Biqa' last July, and ending with [words 
indistinct] recommendation issued by the UN General Assembly 
last month regarding UN Security Council Resolution 425. These 
shocks, which came [words indistinct] were dwarfed by the will 
of the Lebanese. They confirmed that Lebanon has become 
stronger than all the storms, and that it deserves the backing 
of your countries to regain its rights. [passage indistinct] 
  We have participated in the Madrid Conference within the 
framework of the implementation of Resolution 425 to achieve 
just and comprehensive peace and not any partial or unjust 
peace. The assurances contained in all the letters we received 
from the U.S. Administration since 1991 leave no doubt that 
efforts will be made to implement this resolution. 
  We participated out of solidarity with our Arab brothers in 
the Madrid Conference, which also involved the implementation of 
the other UN resolutions, particularly resolutions 242 and 338. 
We are interested in the establishment of a just and 
comprehensive peace. Whoever talks about a comprehensive and 
just peace means peace in the whole area, and not a separate 
peace, but how meaningful peace would be if it is achieved with 
Lebanon and Syria. 
  We extend our thanks to the UN forces--commanders, officers, 
and soldiers--and to their countries. The sacrifices they are 
making to safeguard Lebanese legitimacy in the south in 
implementation of the provisions of Resolution 425 deserve our 
thanks and gratitude. 
  Your Excellencies, the most precious treasure which the 
Lebanese possess is the will to constantly move forward. We 
have three priorities today: Reinforcing national 
reconciliation, launching socioeconomic reconstruction, and 
strengthening Lebanon's position in the area and the world. 
What we have accomplished in a short period confirms that 
Lebanon is a living country. We have moved from an economic 
crisis, social division, and political and military conflict to 
the people rallying around the state and the success of the 
state and personal initiative in checking economic 
deterioration. A big improvement has been achieved in the 
balance of payments this year. We were also able to absorb the 
deficit in the balance of trade, and saw an increase in bank 
deposits and an increase in the development rate to about seven 
percent. 
  Despite the burdens, Lebanon has not defaulted on payment of 
its foreign debts. In this regard, we extend our thanks to the 
World Bank, to the countries that granted us long-term loans, 
and to the Arab funds which provided assistance to projects in 
Lebanon. [passage omitted] 
  Your excellencies, less than two months ago our country 
celebrated the 50th anniversary of its national independence, 
looking to the year 1994 with much hope for positive 
accomplishments. During this year we will complete the building 
of the state, launch the workshop of reconstruction in Beirut 
and the regions; and we anticipate decisive progress in the 
efforts for comprehensive and just peace. What reinforces our 
confidence is the positive international response to our 
efforts, led by the decision of His Holiness Pope John Paul II 
to visit Lebanon in response to invitations by all Lebanese 
officials as a confirmation of the unity of our country and 
reconciliation of its people. 
  Your excellencies, a country that offers coexistence as a 
model to the world and carries the banner of democracy, freedom, 
development, and reconstruction is a country that deserves 
peace. Long live peace, long live Lebanon.

  [Text] Beirut, 6 Jan (MENA)--Lebanese Defense Minister 
Muhsin Dallul has cautioned against the possible escalation of 
military operations by the Israeli occupation forces on the 
Lebanese front before the Syrian-U.S. summit meetings between 
Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton in Geneva in 
mid-January and before preparations for the resumption of 
Arab-Israeli negotiations in Washington. 
  In statements made to MENA, the Lebanese defense minister 
said that the Lebanese Army has taken all the necessary measures 
to confront such Israeli attacks, which are expected at any time. 
  In his statements, Dallul said that Israel always tends to 
exacerbate the situation in south Lebanon before every round of 
talks. Israel will try this time to steal the limelight from 
the U.S.-Syrian meeting, which is important in determining the 
future of the comprehensive and just peace in the region, Muhsin 
Dallul added. 
  Dallul's statements come in response to remarks made by Uri 
Lubrani, coordinator of the Israeli Government's activities in 
south Lebanon. Lubrani expects the Lebanese resistance to 
increase its operations during the next few days. According to 
security reports from the south and western al-Biqa', the 
Islamic resistance forces have been placed on a state of maximum 
alert as a precaution against any Israeli attacks on its 
positions in the Lebanese towns and villages adjacent to the 
occupied border strip. 
  In his statements to MENA, the Lebanese defense minister 
said 
that Lebanon believes that the Arab defense ministers should 
meet as soon as possible to reassess the military situation in 
light of recent developments. Dallul said that Lebanon will 
welcome an invitation by Arab League Secretary General Dr. 
'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid to convene this meeting.

  [Text] Tyre, Lebanon, Jan 7 (AFP)--Israeli-backed 
militiamen opened fire at two tanks manned by Finnish 
peacekeepers in south Lebanon without causing casualties, a UN 
officer here said Friday [7 January]. 
  He told AFP that the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon 
(UNIFIL) protested to Israel over Thursday's incident, which he 
said involved militiamen of the Israeli-trained and financed 
South Lebanese Army (SLA). 
  The tanks were crossing the al-Hamra' bridge, in the western 
sector of Israel's "security zone," on their way to UNIFIL in 
al-Naqurah, south of Tyre, when gunshots were fired in their 
direction, the officer said. 
  Israel told UNIFIL that the SLA forces were aiming at three 
unidentified commandos in the region, he said. 
  A Lebanese police spokesman reported that anti-Israeli 
forces 
late Thursday fired four rocket-propelled grenades at an SLA 
position on the bridge, prompting an immediate retaliation. 
There were no casualties. 
  Last month Israel suspended an Israeli tank commander who 
mistakenly opened fire in south Lebanon, killing a Norwegian UN 
officer and wounding another. 
  Norway and the United Nations lodged official protests with 
Israel over the incident.

  [Text] Amman--AKHBAR AL-USBU' has learned that extensive 
Jordanian-Gulf contacts are currently being held to pave the way 
for holding an Arab summit to produce Arab reconciliation 
committees to settle the existing political and border 
differences among several Arab states, and to draft a formula 
for a new Arab order that can coexist with the new world order 
and make gains for the Arab nation. 
  Jordanian Foreign Ministry sources stressed that these 
contacts have begun with the visits to Jordan by the foreign 
ministers of Qatar, Syria, Egypt, and Palestine. The sources 
said that these contacts will resume next week when the Omani 
foreign minister visits Jordan on Saturday [8 January]. 
  The Foreign Ministry sources said that these political Arab 
moves constitute a translation of the official and popular 
stands of Jordan, which feels that coordinating Arab stands and 
achieving Arab solidarity constitutes the first step toward the 
Arabs' entry into the modern age as an influential political and 
economic force. 
  The sources noted that Qatar and Oman are currently seeking 
to expand their political activities to hold a summit that will 
be the most important and prominent Arab summit, especially 
since it will put an end to fragmentation and estrangement and 
achieve Arab unity and solidarity.

  [Text] Tunis, Jan 6, SPA -- The Council of the Arab 
Ministers of Interior would up its eleventh session in Tunis on 
Wednesday [5 January] under the chairmanship of the Tunisian 
Minister of Interior Abdallah Kallel with a number of 
resolutions aimed at reinforcement of the inter-Arab cooperation 
and coordination to fight against criminal acts, drugs and other 
deviations. 
  The Saudi delegation to the three-day meeting was led by 
Prince Nayif Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, the minister of interior and the 
honorary chairman of the council. 
  The final communique tackled the Arab security joint action 
and ways to enhance cooperation between the Arab states in 
security affairs to dedicate peace and stability all over the 
Arab world. 
  At the start of the meeting, the council, which groups 
interior ministers of member states, endorsed a report presented 
by the secretary general of the council on the activities of the 
general secretariat during the year 1993 when the secretariat 
organized more than 16 meeting for Arab security officials. 
  The council expressed satisfaction over the contents of the 
second half of the report concerning the continuous and 
intensive efforts being made by the general secretariat to 
upgrade contacts and communication with the international 
anticrime specialized organizations including the Interpol and 
the United Nations anti-crime program to show Arab support for 
the activities of these organizations assigned for fighting 
crimes throughout the world. 
  The council reviewed with satisfaction a report presented by 
Prince Nayif and Dr. Faruq Murad, president of the Riyadh-based 
Arab Security Studies and Training Centre (ASSTC) over the 
efforts made by the centre during the last year to upgrade 
technical and human capabilities of the Arab security bodies and 
their personnel. 
  The council also approved the first annual report submitted 
by the general secretariat on what has been implemented of the 
second Arab security plan and thanked the secretariat and the 
ASSTC for what they have done to achieve the positive results. 
  It endorsed more than 200 recommendations made by the 
conferences and meetings organized by the secretariat during 
1993 calling for support and modernization of Arab security 
bodies and closer cooperation in between them. 
  Concerning the drugs menace, the council reviewed the fifth 
and last annual report on the first Arab strategic plan to 
combat drugs and illegal use of narcotics. It endorsed a second 
five-year plan in the same direction besides an agreement to 
combat illegal drugs traffic and all concerned parties have been 
urged to provide every possible technical, legal and judicial 
support for pursuation of criminals. 
  The council also endorsed a draft of a unified and intensive 
information anti-drugs campaign with the aim of spreading 
religious and social awareness on the menace of drugs and the 
consequent social and economic negative impacts of such 
behaviour. 
  An special committee has been formed to tackle problems that 
meet the general secretariat and the council decided to transfer 
the headquarters of the Police Sports Federation from Baghdad to 
Cairo. 
  The council sharply denounced all kinds of terrorism 
particularly the Israeli terrorist acts against the Palestinian 
people inside the occupied territories. It deplored the vicious 
acts being sustained by the Moslem Bosnian people. It decided 
the hold its upcoming session in Tunis on January 1995. 
  Meanwhile, Prince Nayif expressed deep satisfaction over the 
excellent and positive outcome of the meeting and said the final 
resolutions would certainly reinforce the Arab security joint 
action. 
  Prince Nayif, who made the remarks at the end of the meeting 
last night, said every Arab citizen has the right to live in 
peace and stability and highlighted the great efforts being made 
by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to realise maximum level of peace 
and security for its Moslem society for the Arab community at 
large. 
  Prince Nayif commended the existing security cooperation 
between the kingdom and Tunisia. 
  For his part, the secretary general of the Arab Council of 
Interior Ministers, Dr. Ahmad Salim also praised the positive 
resolutions adopted by the meeting. He cited in particular the 
Arab agreement to combat illegal drugs traffic as a brilliant 
achievement which would booster the Arab joint action in 
security and criminal fields. 
  Late last night, Prince Nayif received at his residence the 
Lebanese Minister of Interior Bishara Merhaj and the Mauritanian 
Minister of Interior Al-Morabit Mahmoud Ould Cheikh Ahmed. 
  Prince Nayif also received the Yemeni Minister of Interior, 
Posts and Communication Yahya al-Motwakil. 
  The three meetings were attended by Prince Nawaf Bin Nayif 
Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, Ibrahim Sa'd al-Ibrahim, the Saudi ambassador 
to Tunisia and members of delegations accompanying the 
ministers.

Fayiz al-Miliji in Cairo, on the "Dialogue From Afar" program; 
date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Miliji] What are the factors that prompted the 
Palestinian and Israeli sides to resume negotiations? 
  ['Urayqat] Actually, what halted the negotiations was 
Rabin's 
government. The Palestinian side was willing to continue the 
talks, despite the deep differences, but the Israeli Government 
decided to stop them last week. Now they have decided to resume 
negotiations, and we hope that the aim of these negotiations 
will not be merely for the sake of negotiating. In other words, 
we hope that the resumption of talks will not be an aim in 
itself. 
  [Al-Miliji] The Palestinian and Israeli sides must have 
agreed on common points on which the talks can begin. 
  ['Urayqat] The differences are not linked to specific 
details 
of the crossings issue or other topics. Instead, the issue is 
related to the concepts involved. Israel's concept, as was 
apparent when Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin was in Cairo 
and met President Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], is that Rabin is 
trying to reorganize the occupation through the Declaration of 
Principles, even though the accord stipulates the implementation 
of Resolution 242, which means ending the occupation. This is 
where the problem is. As we noticed, the Declaration of 
Principles stipulates Israeli-Palestinian coordination of the 
crossings. It mentions the Jericho area, not Jericho City, and 
stipulates a withdrawal. But, as we notice, the Israeli 
Government is trying to say that they should have full control 
over the crossings and roads and so forth. Such issues delayed 
the negotiations from the start and led to the failure to 
implement the accord on the scheduled date, 13 December. 
  We hope that the Israeli Government is now ready to enter 
negotiations on ways to implement the withdrawal. [words 
indistinct] the accord to succeed are two elements. The first 
is that the accord combines both the transitional and final 
phases with regard to the withdrawal from the Jericho area and 
the Gaza Strip and redeployment in other areas. The second is 
that President Abu- 'Ammar has declared that he is committed to 
the accord's provisions. Therefore, we hope the Israeli 
Government will adhere to the letter and spirit of accord so 
that we may be able to implement its provisions on the ground. 
  [Al-Miliji] Have the two sides agreed only on the resumption 
of the talks, or have they agreed on a groundwork from which 
negotiations can be launched? 
  ['Urayqat] I believe it is premature to say that an 
agreement 
has been reached before the start of the talks. The return to 
the negotiating table is a positive measure--because we need to 
implement the accord on the ground--but it is too early to say 
whether there has been an agreement prior to the talks. I would 
rule out such an agreement. 
  [Al-Miliji] No doubt efforts have been exerted by parties 
other than the Palestinians and Israelis to resume the 
Palestinian autonomy talks. Will you talk about these parties? 
  ['Urayqat] Actually, there were no other parties. In our 
recent meeting with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, we 
asked for their assistance. He said they would not intervene. 
  The only party that threw its weight behind the resumption 
of 
the talks is Egypt. As we noticed, Egyptian diplomacy did 
everything it could to resume these talks. When he visited 
Jordan, Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa--contrary to Rabin's talk 
about an earlier agreement in Cairo--said there was no 
agreement, there were proposals. 
  I believe that the resumption of talks next week shows the 
success of Egyptian diplomacy in this regard. 
  [Al-Miliji] The Israeli side claimed that a memorandum of 
understanding was reached between the Palestinian and Israeli 
sides at the recent talks in Cairo. Does this mean that there 
should be a third party at any Palestinian-Israeli negotiations? 
  ['Urayqat] I believe that the presence of a third party is 
very important and fundamental at this stage. As we noticed, 
the Israeli side claimed there was an agreement, but 'Amr Musa's 
denial of this agreement decided the issue before the world. 
Rabin thought the world would believe him and not the 
Palestinian side, but Musa put an end to the issue. 
  There are sponsors of this process--the first being the 
United States and the second being Russia. Russia is 
preoccupied with many of its own problems, and the U.S. side is 
not intervening at all. The only side now intervening as a third 
party is Egypt. As Palestinians, we believe that Egypt is our 
partner in the peace process, not an intermediary. Egypt's 
efforts enabled these negotiations to continue, despite numerous 
Israeli obstacles. 
  [Al-Miliji] With the talks on the implementation of 
self-rule 
due to resume Monday [10 January], what is the Palestinian side 
looking for? 
  ['Urayqat] We are looking for a [word indistinct] and 
genuine 
implementation of the accord. The accord literally stipulates a 
withdrawal from the Jericho area and the Gaza Strip. Withdrawal 
means withdrawal. Regarding other areas, the accord stipulates 
the Israeli forces' withdrawal from populated areas and a 
redeployment of the forces. As for the Gaza Strip and the 
Jericho area, the accord stipulated a withdrawal. The 
Palestinian side is looking forward to the sincere beginning of 
the Israeli withdrawal in accordance with the Declaration of 
Principles.

<F P=106> ['Ali al-Salih report: "Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi Tells AL-SHARQ </F>
AL-AWSAT: Before Leaving Tunis We Would Like To Feel Somewhat 
Reassured About Our Demands"] 
  [Text] London -- Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, who is heading a 
delegation representing the signatories of what is now known as 
the reform memorandum submitted to the PLO Executive Committee 
last month, has stated: "Before leaving Tunis, we would like to 
feel somewhat reassured that our demands will be met." 
  He added that "the purpose of the current meetings is to 
work 
for the implementation of what the signatories spelled out in 
their memorandum, particularly exercise of democracy in the 
management of PLO affairs and the employment of qualified 
Palestinians, irrespective of political and personal factors." 
Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi, who was speaking to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT by 
telephone from Tunis, described the meetings already held as 
good, with no fundamental differences and no emotionalism. The 
purpose of these meetings, he said, was to exchange views. 
  He said that last night's session was devoted to a 
discussion 
of the brief memorandum submitted to the Executive Committee 
during the meeting. 
  It should be noted that, in addition to Dr. Haydar 
'Abd-al-Shafi, the reform delegation includes 'Abd-al-Hafiz 
al-Ashhab (independent), Taysir 'Aruri (People's Party), Nabil 
'Amr (member of Fatah's Revolutionary Council), Ibrahim 
Abu-'Abbas (former engineers' doyen in Jordan), Tawfiq Abu-Bakr 
(independent journalist), and Ghazi al-Khalili (Fida Party). 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi refused to say what the memorandum was 
about but said that it was derived from "the main document." 
Asked if the brief memorandum included practical steps for the 
implementation of their demands, Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi said: "Let 
us not anticipate events." 
  Commenting on the statement attributed to him that he would 
not leave Tunis "empty-handed," Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi said: "We did 
not come to Tunis just to look at one another. Our people are 
facing major challenges and the necessary measures must be taken 
to meet these challenges." 
  In reply to the question what do you hope to achieve, he 
said: "That our viewpoint should be upheld in principle. Before 
leaving Tunis we would like to feel somewhat reassured that our 
demands will be met or that they are on the way to being met."

<F P=106> [By Hamida Ben Salah] </F>
  [Excerpt] Tunis, Jan 6 (AFP) -- Leading Palestinians on 
Thursday [6 January] said they failed to persuade PLO chief 
Yasir 'Arafat to stop "monopolizing" decisions on the peace 
process and make the organization more democratic. 
  "'Arafat is continuing to monopolize power," delegation 
leader Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi said at the end of a five-day 
mission at the PLO headquarters in Tunis to press for more 
democracy. 
  He blamed PLO executive committee members for showing no 
interest in making joint decisions. 
  "We cannot blame Abu-'Ammar ('Arafat). A man can only 
monopolize power if he has no partners who want to share it with 
him," said 'Abd-al-Shafi, a former leader of the Palestinian 
negotiating team to bilateral peace talks with Israel. 
  He said democracy within the executive committee would have 
"positive effects at all levels of the Palestinian organization." 
  But 'Abd-al-Shafi confirmed reports Wednesday that the 
executive committee had met one delegation demand by giving him 
full powers to organize a broad dialogue grouping all factions 
with the aim of uniting the Palestinians. 
  The delegation arrived here Sunday calling for the adoption 
of nine points included in a memorandum signed two weeks before 
by 120 prominent Palestinian personalities from the occupied 
territories and the diaspora last month. 
  The memorandum called for more democracy in running PLO 
affairs and demanded a change in the conduct of negotiations 
with Israel over limited autonomy in the Gaza Strip and the West 
Bank town of Jericho. 
  'Arafat, who has been accused of being autocratic, is yet to 
comment on the proposals. 
  The petition called for mapping out a strategy for the 
self-rule negotiations, setting up a committee for directing the 
talks, and choosing negotiators based on merit rather than on 
political considerations. 
  The petition also demanded respect for human rights. 
  Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi said Monday: "There is no hope for us 
if 
we don't practice real democracy." 
  The delegation wanted 'Arafat to make a "commitment to more 
democracy, set up a collective leadership, broaden the base for 
making decisions, and encourage diverse Palestinian 
participation without favoritism," he said. 
  'Abd-al-Shafi urged that the leadership must make a "total 
and serious" commitment to all aspects of democracy, and that 
decision-making must not be left entirely in 'Arafat's hands. 
  A founding PLO member, he stressed the need to use 
Palestinians of ability at this "decisive" time, when the 
organisation and Israel are struggling to make headway in 
implementing the accord for self-rule. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. 'Abd-al-Hafiz al-Ashhab, member of </F>
Palestinian team pressing PLO for reforms; place and date not 
given -- recorded; carried within the "With the Events" program] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. 'Abd-al-Hafiz al-Ashhab, the talks 
with the PLO leadership and the its Executive Committee on PLO 
reforms have ended in Tunis. What decisions or recommendations 
were issued at the end of these talks? 
  [Al-Ashhab] As a matter of fact, we came to Tunis to discuss 
a memorandum presented to the Palestinian leadership two or 
three weeks prior to our arrival in Tunis. As you know, this 
memorandum was signed by 120 Palestinian figures from inside and 
outside [the occupied territories]. We found understanding on 
the part of the Palestinian leadership of these demands. Some 
demands were immediately approved and a mechanism was created to 
implement them. We found that some other ideas were referred to 
PLO institutions. We asked for activating these institutions so 
they could assume their role in implementing what was contained 
in the items of this memorandum. 
  [Mu'addi] What are the ideas to which the PLO leadership has 
responded? 
  [Al-Ashhab] In fact, we stressed national dialogue and 
asserted the need to unify all components of the PLO Executive 
Committee. As you know, some PLO members announced that they 
were freezing their membership. Some of them withdrew and 
others resigned. We asked the leadership to issue a statement 
calling for unified ranks and the return of those brothers to 
the PLO Executive Committee. After this statement, a committee 
under Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi will be set up. This committee will 
contact those brothers, and we will attain this demand for the 
return of those people to the PLO ranks.

  [Text] The Alliance of the Palestinian Forces [APF] held a 
news conference at noon today at al-Khalisah Compound of the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine--General Command 
at al-Yarmuk Camp south of Damascus. The APF released a 
statement detailing the alliance's political goals and 
structure. Following is the statement's full text: 
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. The key 
goals of the APF: The political goals include proceeding from 
the necessity to keep the struggle going in order to topple the 
Gaza-Jericho accord and realize our people's and the Arab and 
Islamic nation's objectives, the alliance obligates itself to 
the following: 
  First, on the Palestinian front: 
  1. The Palestinian National Charter. 
  2. Our people's inalienable rights to their homeland, 
Palestine, liberation, return, self-determination, and full 
national independence. 
  3. The Palestinian issue is an Arab and Islamic one. The 
responsibility for the deliverance of Palestine must be borne by 
the Arab and Islamic nation, most of all the Palestinian people. 
  4. Our people's and territory's unity and that of their 
cause and objectives and their national destiny and adherence to 
all their national and historic rights. No one has the right to 
cede any part of these rights. 
  5. Adherence to the option of armed struggle and jihad as 
a principal tool to attain liberation. 
  6. Adherence to the unity of the Palestinian people 
inside and outside the occupied homeland as well as the 
integrity of their land. 
  7. The alliance deems the PLO a national achievement 
whose gains must be safeguarded and institutions rebuilt on 
democratic foundations. 
  8. The alliance deems the present PLO leadership 
unrepresentative of the Palestinian people or their hopes and 
aspirations. 
  9. The alliance deems the recognition document and the 
'Arafat- Rabin agreement national treason that all possible 
means must be used to topple. Neither the document nor the 
agreement are binding on the Palestinian people. 
  10. Adherence to Palestine as a historic homeland that 
has no alternative for the Palestinian people, and resistance to 
all projects of a substitute homeland or resettlement, transfer, 
compensation, or attempts to suppress the Palestinian people's 
national identity. 
  11. Boycotting the political, administrative institutions 
responsible for implementing the self-administration and the 
Gaza-Jericho accord and the holding of elections for the self- 
administration council, and organizing the widest possible 
popular campaign to isolate, ostracize, and topple these 
institutions. 
  12. Severing links with all the institutions that 'Arafat 
or his team lead or are involved in under the name of the PLO. 
  13. A determination to pursue and step up armed struggle 
and all forms of political and mass struggle, particularly 
inside the occupied territory to keep the popular intifadah 
going as the main arena of conflict with the Zionist enemy to 
promote the inalienable, historic and national rights of the 
Palestinian people. 
  Second, on the Arab and Islamic fronts: 
  1. A reaffirmation that the Palestinian cause is the core 
of the Arab-Zionist conflict. 
  2. Taking into consideration that the dangers attendant 
to the 'Arafat-Rabin accord are not limited to the Palestinian 
people and Palestine but constitute a threat to the Arab and 
Islamic nation, the APF would like to make it clear that facing 
this liquidatory conspiracy and its repercussions is a 
responsibility for the Palestinian people and Arab and Muslim 
masses. 
  3. A bolstering of joint Palestinian-Arab-Muslim militant 
ties to counter Zionist and expansionist hegemonic blueprints 
and political, cultural, and economic normalization. 
  4. A reaffirmation of the right of the Palestinian people 
in the diaspora to exercise their militant responsibilities 
alongside the nationalist, Islamic, and Arab forces to promote 
liberation, return, self-determination, and full national 
independence. 
  Third, on the global front: 
  1. The role being played by the United States supporting 
the Zionist entity and advocating its plans against our 
Palestinian people and their struggle and the Arab liberation 
movement is deemed by the alliance a brazen aggression on our 
people and our national cause. 
  2. The APF underscores the importance of stepping up 
cooperation with the Islamic, Asian, and African states, as well 
as with all the friendly nations standing by the struggle of our 
Palestinian people and supporting their inalienable national 
rights. 
  3. We stress the importance of forging an alliance with 
all the forces for liberation and progress around the world -- 
the forces that reject imperialist domination and Zionist 
invasion and support our struggle and our national rights. 
  4. To work to disseminate all that relates to the 
Palestinian cause and the national struggle to win the widest 
possible public opinion over to the cause of our struggle and 
our rights and to make the case that the 'Arafat-Rabin agreement 
neither amounts to a solution nor brings peace. 
  The alliance's structure: 
  Inspired by its political goals, the APF is to form a 
Central 
Command, which will be responsible for formulating its 
decisions, policies, and political goals: 
  A -- The numerical composition: Each faction will have two 
representatives on the APF's Central Command. 
  B -- The meetings: The Central Command is to convene 
sessions at least once a month. This is in addition to 
extraordinary meetings that may be convened at the request of at 
least four factions. Decisions are to be adopted by agreement 
[bittawafuq], and the meetings are to be chaired on a rotating 
basis. 
  C -- A Secretariat is to be set up for the APF and each 
faction will have one representative there. It will convene at 
least once a week, or whenever the need arises. Its task will 
be to follow and see to the implementation of the Central 
Command's resolutions. The Secretariat will have permanent 
headquarters. 
  [signed] The APF: The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas; 
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General 
Command; the Palestinian National Resistance Movement, Fatah; 
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine; the 
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine; the Popular 
Liberation War Vanguards--al-Sa'iqah Forces; the Palestinian 
Struggle Front; the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine; the 
Revolutionary Palestinian Communist Party; and the Palestine 
Liberation Front

  [Text] According to the latest reports from the south, a 
Palestinian was wounded in the Israeli raid on a position 
belonging to the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC] on the al-Na'imah hills this 
afternoon. However, Palestinian sources said that the wounded 
person is a Lebanese civilian who happened to be driving his car 
in the vicinity during the raid. He was wounded in the hand. 
  Our correspondent in al-Nabatiyah reports that the Iqlim 
al-Tuffah hills, particularly Mlita, 'Ayn Bu Siwar, and 
al-Luwayzah, came under intermittent bombardment from the 
Israeli positions in al-Zaffatah. The Israeli artillery 
emplacements on the hills of Sujud and al-Suwayda' raked 
opposite positions. Two Israeli helicopters overflew the hills 
facing the city of al-Nabatiyah.

  [Text] Hebron, Occupied West Bank, Jan 6 (AFP)--Three more 
senior members of Fatah, the main PLO faction, in the occupied 
territories resigned on Thursday [6 January] in a burgeoning row 
over the way Yasir 'Arafat's movement is run. 
  "After several attempt to discuss with the leadership the 
absence of democracy and consultation within Fatah, we had no 
choice but to resign," said 33-year-old Jibril al-Bakri. 
  "The leadership has appointed to positions of responsibility 
people who have nothing to do with Fatah", al-Bakri said, but 
refused to explain. 
  Husayn al-Nazir, 30, and Diyab al-Sharabati, 35, resigned 
from Fatah's High Committee in Hebron along with al-Bakri. 
  Their move follows a walkout at the end of December by three 
leaders of the Fatah youth movement in Gaza after 'Arafat gave 
top jobs to aging Palestinians who played little part in the 
uprising or intifadah. The Fatah chief for the north of the 
West Bank also stood down. 
  "These resignations reflect a crisis as Fatah changes into a 
political party, said Jamal al-Shubaqi, another senior Fatah 
figure in Hebron. 
  The Palestine Liberation Organization's executive committee 
met in Tunis this week to discuss democratization after a 
petition from 120 leading Palestinian figures.

<F P=106> [Report by Ahmad 'Ubaydat, carried within the "With the </F>
Events" program] 
  [Text] Three Fatah activists in the governorate of Hebron 
tendered their resignations yesterday due to the absence of a 
democratic policy within the PLO institutions. This was stated 
by Husayn al-Nazir, member of the Fatah Committee in the 
governorate of Hebron, who resigned yesterday. 
  [Begin al-Nazir recording] In fact, there are several 
reasons for the resignation. These reasons have accumulated due 
to the bad or deteriorating internal situation in the Fatah 
institutions in the past few months. 
  Practically, the absence of a democratic policy in the Fatah 
institutions has negatively reflected on the situation in the 
occupied territories, particularly the southern region. This 
was one of the reasons for the resignation. In addition, there 
are personalities from outside Fatah. These are bad 
personalities who hold sensitive posts inside Fatah. We 
recently learned about the presence of personalities who carried 
letters entrusting them with forming a security apparatus. This 
apparatus is one of the most serious Fatah organs, so entrusting 
a bad personality with running this apparatus will practically 
destroy Fatah's internal structure in our positions. [end 
recording] 
  These resignations came after some Fatah activists in the 
territories also tendered their resignations for the same 
reason. These collective resignations express the existence of a 
crisis inside the PLO. Al-Nazir added: 
  [Begin al-Nazir recording] In our opinion, our historic 
leadership, led by brother leader Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], 
whom we respect very much, is surrounded by a group of 
personalities who do not brief him on the true reports sent from 
the territories. These are the reasons for the rise of 
traditional personalities who are outside the organization and 
who are even away from the suffering of the strugglers. These 
strugglers were always in the confrontation lines. 
  We demand our leadership to return to the PLO Executive 
Committee, the Fatah Central Committee, the Fatah Revolutionary 
Council, and the Fatah General Congress, so the future internal 
arrangements and reforms may, in one way or another, lead to the 
circumvention of this crisis, and, consequently, decisions will 
be somewhat sound ones. We would agree if 70 percent of the 
stands were sound ones. However, we will not agree if only 10 
percent of stands are sound ones. 
  In the past, we frequently tried to hold discussions with 
our 
leadership to tackle this situation. However, we were surprised 
that it ignored us or did not pay attention to our demands. We 
were also surprised by the appointment of political 
personalities who are outside the organization and who are more 
preoccupied with the political situation. This has prevented 
these personalities from coordinating with the territories' 
leadership and the leadership abroad. 
  We have resigned from our posts and not from our membership 
or our citizenship. We are citizens and [Fatah] members. 
However, we refuse to be appointed in sensitive posts under 
these difficult historical circumstances, whose developments we 
are far away from. We demand our leadership prepare a clear 
political program for the new phase. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Gaza, QUDS PRESS -- A Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] leader has said that his movement will not participate 
in any authority, stemming from the Palestinian-Israeli 
Declaration of Principles, during the interim stage in the 
occupied territories. 
  Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar stressed to QUDS PRESS: Naturally, we 
will not participate in any legislative or executive institution 
linked to self-rule so that we will not bear the responsibility 
for signing an agreement that is incompatible with our doctrine 
and political program. Hamas, however, will participate in any 
elections to choose the Palestinian people's representatives 
provided those elections are not connected to the agreement or 
to any preconditions that might divert the elections toward 
political goals that are inconsistent with our tendencies. 
  Al-Zahhar ruled out any clash between the Palestinian 
authority expected to be established in the occupied territories 
and Hamas. He said: We will endeavor to solve our problems on a 
personal level. In the event that any problem develops we will 
ask to meet with PLO officials or the authority to resolve the 
differences. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In Amman, Muhammad Nazzal, Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] spokesman in Jordan, has voiced the movement's 
determination to carry out major operations in the occupied 
territories. In an interview with the French magazine V.S. DAY 
[name as heard] published today, Nazzal said that the coming 
days will witness successive and escalating operations. 
  Nazzal indicated that since the signing of the Oslo 
agreement 
between the PLO and Israel, the intifadah has acquired a new 
dimension represented by the use of automatic weapons and 
suicide operations. He stressed Hamas' refusal to cease-fire 
with the Israelis. He said that the movement is committed to 
continuing struggle against the Israeli occupation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hamas, Islamic Resistance Movement, official </F>
spokesman engineer Ibrahim Ghawshah by KEYHAN correspondent 
Hasan Khamehyar; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Khamehyar] Some believe that the train carrying 
the solution to the Middle East dispute has reached the first 
station and that normalization of relations between Arabs and 
the Zionist regime in the political, economic, and cultural 
fields is imminent. How does Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] view these changes? 
  [Ghawshah] Permit me to state that what is being described 
as 
the peace train is a mere falsehood. What has really happened 
is that the Zionist enemy has managed to sign an agreement in 
the form of a "principled accord." This accord does not include 
a clause mandating its implementation and that implementation 
has been postponed. In lieu of this accord, the Zionist regime 
has practiced extortion on the Palestinians, the Arabs, and the 
countries of the world. It wants the Arabs to lift economic 
embargoes on Israel and to normalize relations. It demands 
economic assistance from Western countries. Therefore, what has 
happened up to now is not peace but a complete lie. On the 
other hand, the accord has been evaluated and it has been proven 
to everyone that the elements of weakness and discord are 
greater than those for attaining power and prosperity. 
  [Khamehyar] As you have stated, we also concur that the 
accord is one of surrender and compromise. What is your concept 
of peace? 
  [Ghawshah] This accord is one-sided and the rights of one of 
the sides has not been taken into consideration. The 
Palestinian side signed the accord when it did not have any 
freedom of action. It can be said that the accord was dictated 
to it and it was forced to accept it. [passage omitted] 
  [Khamehyar] In view of the people's opposition to the 
Gaza-Jericho accord, what program do you have to defuse such 
opposition? 
  [Ghawshah] Following the reports on such an accord, the 
Palestinians were engulfed by a wave of astonishment. However, 
they soon recovered and the nation woke up to the treacherous 
nature of the plot and began to oppose it. On 13 September 
armed operations, especially martyrdom-seeking operations, 
proliferated among the combatant Palestinian youth. 
  In addition, many supporters of the Fatah movement also 
joined the fray in opposing the mounting suppression of the 
Palestinian revolutionaries by the Zionist soldiers and security 
forces. In the past three days anti-Zionist operations have 
risen noticeably; in just one day one of the mujahidin was 
martyred and 80 others were wounded. Therefore, it can be said 
that the people's opposition to the Gaza-Jericho accord has 
proliferated remarkably. 
  However, with regard to the 10 Palestinian factions, their 
current activities in the occupied areas are more in the fields 
of publications and politics rather than operations. Outside 
the occupied areas, no serious measure has been taken to create 
solidarity and political coordination. Nevertheless, all these 
groups should not be viewed in the same light as those, such as 
Hamas, that have never stopped their activities and do not wait 
for any unified or concerted decisions by the 10 factions. They 
continue their jihad and strategic struggle. [passage omitted] 
  [Khamehyar] 'Arafat is now seeking to mitigate the intense 
opposition of the various Palestinian groups to the Gaza-Jericho 
accord, and it is for this purpose that he met leader of the 
Muslim Brotherhood Mustafa Mashhur in Egypt and requested his 
mediation between you and him. The head of the Palestinian 
delegation to Madrid, Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, also played the same 
role. How does Hamas view these efforts? 
  [Ghawshah] These are political tactics that the beleaguered 
'Arafat resorts to constantly. The aware Islamic movements 
never fall prey to these deceptions. After signing the 
Gaza-Jericho accord on 20 August 1993, 'Arafat officially 
recognized the Zionist enemy and went to Yemen. He requested 
that the president arrange a meeting between himself and Hamas, 
after which a Yemeni faction tried to mediate but Hamas rejected 
the overtures and announced that it would not meet 'Arafat. 
[passage omitted] 
  Unfortunately, our Muslim Egyptian brothers met 'Arafat. 
Perhaps this meeting was arranged under certain circumstances 
that were imposed or merely conformed to the nature of the 
Egyptian regime. [sentence as published]. It is also possible 
that the Egyptian regime created the conditions for such a 
meeting. It is well known that Hamas officially conveyed its 
displeasure about this meeting to the Muslim Brotherhood. We 
told them that such a meeting was not necessary and that 'Arafat 
should not be given the opportunity to benefit from the support 
and cover of Islamists. [passage omitted] 
  [Khamehyar] The second Islamic Peoples' Conference is being 
convened in Khartoum because of the efforts of Hasan al-Turabi 
and some reports say that 'Arafat will participate. In view of 
the fact that the Sudanese have not adopted a clear stance on 
the 'Arafat-Rabin compromise, what is the Hamas position on this 
conference, especially on Hasan al-Turabi? 
  [Ghawshah] Allow me to speak clearly on this subject. Hamas 
was invited to participate in this conference. We were the 
founding members of this congress in April 1991, and I remember 
that the Islamic Republic of Iran was also a founding member. 
Hamas assessed the invitation in light of Sudan's political 
posture. There was a difference of opinion in the Hamas 
political bureau. One was that the conference should be 
boycotted because the Sudanese Government had tacitly supported 
the accord. In addition, the Sudanese Foreign Minister, as well 
as the director of the political desk at the Sudanese Foreign 
Ministry, had declared their support of the 'Arafat-Rabin 
compromise. Similarly, the Sudanese representative to the Arab 
League had supported the compromise. 
  Al-Turabi statements have been conflicting. On the one hand 
he directly supported 'Arafat, but on the other he criticized 
many of the clauses in the accord. It was on this basis that 
some of the Hamas members opposed our participation in the Sudan 
conference. 
  Another group [in Hamas] believed that for the sake of 
expediency, after obtaining the actual stance of the Sudanese, 
we should participate in the conference, and a message was sent 
to Hasan al-Turabi by Hamas. 
  The other point is that Hasan al-Turabi assured us that the 
issue of the Gaza-Jericho accord would not be on the 
conference's agenda and that this issue would be delegated to 
the participating teams. It was on this basis that the Hamas 
political bureau decided to participate in this conference and 
to condemn the Gaza-Jericho accord at the Islamic Peoples' 
Conference in Sudan. We also agreed that if 'Arafat planned to 
participate we would boycott the conference. [passage omitted] 
  [Khamehyar] Will you participate in the autonomous elections 
scheduled for next year? What is your opinion on Shim'on Peres' 
remarks that if Hamas gains votes in the next elections they 
will be annulled? 
  [Ghawshah] These offensive remarks are a trait of the filthy 
and strategic propaganda of the Zionists. The PLO is also 
seeking to propound similar premises to deceive Hamas so that it 
can be dragged into the elections. The Hamas position is as 
follows: 
  First, as all are aware, the agreement on Gaza and Jericho 
has been signed for limited autonomy. It is possible that in 
the future it would include the West Bank and Gaza. Hamas 
rejects the Gaza-Jericho autonomy accord. It basically rejects 
the mechanism [preceding word in English] of autonomy since the 
elections are part of this mechanism for the implementation of 
autonomy. No movement can tolerate its principles being 
trampled underfoot and accept this mechanism. It is for this 
reason that Hamas has officially declared its opposition to the 
elections and has asked the people to boycott them, but not with 
violence. This is the final stance of Hamas, which has been 
adopted especially on the elections for autonomy, after 
extensive discussions among the movement's leaders. 
  [Khamehyar] It is feared that if the opponents of this 
compromise continue their course of action and support the 
intifadah, they will be hounded and suppressed. How do you see 
the future? 
  [Ghawshah] When one carries the banner of the jihad, he does 
not fear anything and has considered the consequences. He knows 
what price he will pay for his lawful obligations. [passage 
omitted] 
  We are aware that the United States is seeking to scorch the 
roots of Hamas. It is exerting pressure on Saudi Arabia to 
prevent the Saudi people's zakat [alms] from reaching Hamas. It 
has also asked Jordan to pressure Hamas and prevent its 
political and propaganda activities on Jordanian soil. It is 
also clear that the United States is pressuring Syria to limit 
the activities of the 10 factions. 
  We are confident that the noble countries and governments 
will not succumb to such pressure and blackmail and that the 
Muslim nations will continue to support the struggling Islamic 
movements of Palestine. 
  [Khamehyar] In your interview with the Beirut newspaper 
AL-DIYAR, you announced that a conference would be convened with 
the extensive participation of Islamic groups and factions so 
that a strategic stance for combating this plot could be 
adopted. In view of the fact that a conference like this was 
convened last year, what are your expectations of this kind of 
conference? 
  [Ghawshah] When I was interviewed by AL-DIYAR newspaper, I 
was very aware that, in cooperation with the 10 Palestinian 
factions, Hamas would be able to establish a national and 
Islamic coalition for counteracting the Gaza-Jericho accord. It 
was suggested that the conference should be held in Yemen or 
Syria, but it was postponed after some of the groups reviewed 
their decisions. We are optimistic that we can eliminate the 
obstacles in the near future and that, under the aegis of our 
common denominators, we will be able to attain complete cohesion 
and coordination. 
  I believe that this conference will be extremely important. 
In this manner, we will be able to prove to the world that the 
Palestinian nation is alive and can elect the leadership it 
wants. 
  [Khamehyar] Last week, King Husayn presented the Jordanian 
parliament with a plan to normalize relations with Israel, and 
the deputies unanimously supported this plan. If this plan is 
approved, will your position in Jordan be endangered? 
  [Ghawshah] Perhaps a majority of the deputies who were 
recently elected to the parliament agree with this plan, but one 
must await the outcome of the debates over the qualifications of 
these deputies. Don't forget that there is intense opposition 
to the normalization of relations with the Zionist regime among 
the people and the parliament of that country. Half of the 
people in Jordan are Palestinians, and recent polls prove that 
most of the people are opposed to the Gaza-Jericho accord. We 
are aware that the Jordanian regime has accepted this accord 
because of pressure from the United States. 
  The Jordanians initially declared their opposition to the 
accord. But when Clinton's message, which mentioned economic 
pressure, reached the hands of the Jordanian officials, Jordan 
agreed to accept the accord. 
  Let us not forget that the Gaza-Jericho accord also 
threatens 
the interests of Jordan, which has been referred to as the 
substitute homeland for Palestine and as the ultimate homeland 
of the Palestinians, and the people are very aware of these 
threats. 
  What is your opinion of the recent letters and guidance 
that Hamas leader Shaykh Ahmad Yasin sent from prison? He has 
agreed to participate in the legislative body that will be 
established after the elections. What is your appraisal of the 
matter? 
  [Ghawshah] We have received three letters from Shaykh Ahmad 
Yasin that were sent from prison. In the first letter, he gave 
the details of his meeting with Israeli legislator Talab 
al-Sani' [name as published]. In the second, he listed guidance 
for the Hamas forces and combatants. The third letter--which 
has generated a great deal of controversy--dealt with the 
current situation, the Gaza-Jericho accord, the PLO, and the 
fate of the Palestine issue. In this letter, Shaykh Yasin 
stressed that the Gaza-Jericho accord is an accord of 
degradation and surrender and that the PLO has destroyed the 
hopes and aspirations of the Palestinian nation. He refers to 
the so-called legislative body and accepts participation in 
elections. It is for this reason that this letter has plunged 
us into doubt and ambivalence. Everyone is aware that Ahmad 
Yasin rejects autonomy and that he is paralyzed and cannot write 
letters. He needs another person to write what he dictates. The 
Hamas councils are currently investigating the letters to 
establish their authenticity.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Palestinian-Jordanian Coordination"] </F>
  [Text] Palestinian-Arab relations remain one of the most 
important pillars that are supposed to be firm and sound and 
which can be relied on during all crises and dangers confronting 
the Palestinian cause at present and in the future. The Arab 
dimension of this cause represented and continues to represent a 
strategic and moral weight for the Palestinian people, who will 
never renounce their Arab affiliation and will not allow 
transitory events to instill doubts in them about or weaken 
their faith in the common pan-Arab destiny which links them with 
the other peoples of the Arab nation. 
  In this context, Palestinian-Jordanian relations derive 
additional importance. Jordan has been linked to Palestine with 
a close fraternal bond which has been enhanced socially, 
politically, and in terms of population. One can say, without 
exaggeration, that this relationship or bond has reached the 
stage of inter-family cohesion, whereby it seems impossible to 
split this link without almost fatal consequences for the two 
fraternal people. 
  Although neither the Palestinian nor the Jordanian side has 
precisely explained the reasons for the misunderstanding between 
them other than what was stated in the Jordanian monarch's two 
speeches, from which one can discern the emphasis placed on the 
importance of prompt coordination between the two leaderships, 
apparently the speeches' reverberations invoked a rational 
understanding by the Palestinian side. Hence, the visit by 
Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department, to Amman. 
This visit reflects the Palestinian leadeship's eagerness to 
preserve the special fraternal relationship with Jordan and 
develop it in the interest of the two brotherly people and the 
future of the Arab nation. 
  It is certain that adopting an approach of openness and 
frankness, overcoming the difficulties, and clarifying any 
misunderstandings that occur constitute a healthy and correct 
basis for any sort of coordination between the two parties. If 
at present the PLO is experiencing negotiating problems with 
Israel, one of the priorities of the Palestinian and Jordanian 
sides is to exchange views, coordinate positions in a climate of 
mutual trust, remove suspicions, and clear the climate. This is 
the only way for enhancing the two sides' negotiating stance 
vis-a-vis Israel with the aim of reaching a just and 
comprehensive settlement aspired for by the two sides and the 
entire Arab nation.

  [Text] The Council of Ministers held a regular session 
under First Deputy Prime Minister brother Dr. Hasan Muhammad 
Makki this morning. 
  At the outset of the session, the Council of Ministers 
reviewed and endorsed the decisions it debated during its 
previous session. 
  The Council devoted this session to debating the homeland's 
economic situation, including the results of the meeting held 
among representatives of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry 
of Supply and Trade, the Central Bank of Yemen, commercial 
banks, and the Union of the Chambers of Commerce and Industry. 
  The Council endorsed urgent executive measures to remedy and 
mitigate the economic problems in the country. The Council also 
reviewed instructions addressed by the Presidential Council to 
the brother prime minister and government ministers, urging them 
to shoulder their responsibilities to rapidly address the 
difficult living conditions and supply situation being 
experienced by citizens, and to ease their exacerbating problems. 
  The Council was also apprised of a report submitted by 
Education Minister Dr. Abu-Bakr al-Qirbi on the visit he made to 
Washington for negotiations with the IMF on the 11th investment 
loan to be used in financing the educational sector, which has

during the period 21-26 December, during which a Yemeni-Turkish 
health agreement was signed. This agreement aims to advance 
bilateral coordination and cooperation in the areas of health 
and curative medicine. It also provides for exchanging 
technical expertise between Yemen and Turkey, particularly in 
the field of advanced technical training.

<F P=106> ["Text" of message addressed by the Presidential Council to </F>
Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al'-Attas and cabinet members on 
6 January--read by announcer] 
  [Text] Brother Engineer Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr 
al-'Attas, brother esteemed members of the Council of Ministers: 
You must be aware of the deteriorating economic situation in 
our country and that the majority of citizens are suffering in 
their daily lives as a result of the escalating price hikes, 
sharp and continued deterioration of the value of the national 
currency, and the accompanying funding shortages affecting most 
basic commodities and supplies. All this has taken place very 
rapidly in front of the government's eyes. 
  In view of our citizens' deteriorating living conditions, 
difficulties, and suffering, it is a violation of your 
government's constitutional and national responsiblity to be 
indifferent toward these conditions and to fail to adopt the 
required measures to tackle them. Motivated by its national 
duty and historic responsibility, the Presidential Council 
addresses this message to you to place you before your 
responsibilities toward the continued deterioration of the 
economic and administrative situation and toward citizens' 
difficult living conditions. Also, there has been noticeable 
failure to draw up and implement a clear and sound supply, 
financial, and monetary policy. The Government has also failed 
to activate the existing laws to curb illegitimate currency 
speculation, stop price increases, and prevent monopolies. All 
that has resulted in a great increase in inflation rates, high 
unemployment, and low wages and incomes. In addition, the 
state's facilities and departments have witnessed general 
laxity, carelessness, and negligence. There has also been a 
noticeable drop in the level of job performance in the state's 
administrative system and institutions. All the above points 
are at the heart of the tasks and duties which your esteemed 
government should have carried out in accordance with the 
Constitution and in implementation of the policy statement on 
the bases of which it won the House of Representatives' vote of 
confidence. All the masses of our Yemeni people looked to you 
with hope and confidence that you would devote all your efforts 
and energies to implement that statement to overcome the 
shortcomings of the transitional period and the failures that 
accompanied it and to firmly establish the pillars of the modern 
Yemeni state. 
  Aware of these regrettable conditions, and of the growing 
suffering that their exacerbation would cause to citizens, the 
Presidential Council, during its session of 23 December 1993, 
invited your esteemed government for a joint meeting with the 
Presidential Council to discuss the current political crisis and 
the economic situation and to examine ways of tackling that 
situation. However, most regrettably, the Presidential Council 
was surprised to receive the brother prime minister's message 
No. 6/1,241 of 26 December 1993, which conveys an apology for 
not attending the meeting on the date set by the Presidential 
Council. Meanwhile, the repercussions of the crisis were 
escalating and becoming more serious, thus increasing citizens' 
suffering to such an extent that any delay was intolerable. 
Suddenly, the national currency plunged to low and serious 
levels. This coincided with a general paralysis in the state's 
departments and facilities and with an absence of the 
government's role. In view of that situation, we hold you fully 
responsible for the deteriorating situation and for all its 
repercussions and harmful effects on citizens' interests and the 
homeland's stability. 
  Brother Prime Minister, Brother Ministers: The homeland is 
passing through a crucial, historic juncture and works to firmly 
establish the pillars of its existence and boost its promising 
march toward a prosperous future, God willing. Thanks to the 
will of the strugglers and the efforts of all its sincere sons, 
our homeland was able on 22 May 1990 to revive a gigantic unity 
which won the world's admiration and respect. All this requires 
that you stand with responsibility, faithfulness, and sincerity 
in front of your consciences and responsibility and to side with 
the issues and interests of your homeland and people and to 
place the supreme national interest above all selfish interests 
and all narrow affiliations. If, at any moment, you surrender 
to such affiliations, the homeland will gain nothing but loss, 
and you will gain nothing from that but the dissatisfaction of 
your people, who had expected much from you. You are today 
before a historic and national responsibility which you should 
not fail to carry, whatever the justifications may be. We in 
the Presidential Council will be a support for you inasmuch as 
you will be a support for yourselves and sincere to your 
responsibilities and homeland in order to honor the trust and 
reform the duty. 
  May God grant you success and help everyone in the interest 
of Yemen and its progress and prosperity under the banner of 
unity and democracy. May God's peace and blessings be upon you. 
  [Signed] Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman 
of 
the Presidential Council

<F P=106> [Lutfi Shatarah report: "Withdrawal of Yemeni Opposition </F>
From Dialogue Committee"] 
  [Excerpt] Aden -- All parties taking part in the Political 
Dialogue Committee have withdrawn from the committee with the 
exception of the representatives of the ruling tripartite 
coalition (the Yemeni Socialist Party, the General People's 
Congress, and the Reform Grouping). 
  The Dialogue Committee had come a long way when it resumed 
its meetings in Aden last Sunday but representatives of the 
opposition parties felt that there was what they called 
"procrastination, dithering, and time-wasting" by the Yemeni 
Socialist Party and the General People's Congress at the 
meetings held the day before yesterday. 
  The withdrawn parties include the opposition's National Bloc 
parties, Deputy Prime Minister Brigadier General Mujahid 
Abu-Shawarib, the Patriotic Forces Union, the Ba'th Party, 
representatives of the "Yemeni Revolution's Fighters," and the 
September Party representative Brigadier General Ahmad Qarhash. 
These parties decided to hold a meeting this evening to take a 
clear and decisive stance on the issues under discussion and on 
the dialogue itself. 
  Some partisan sources have accused some members of the 
coalition, whom they declined to name, of using the time factor 
to foil the dialogue and carry out previous designs. 
  The sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the withdrawing 
parties and figures would announce a resolution to the effect 
that "there should either be a dialogue aimed at achieving good 
and tangible results or no dialogue at all, in which case the 
coalition parties obstructing the dialogue will be held fully 
responsible." [passage omitted]

released from prison installations in southern Israel. They are 
now on their way home. Our correspondent Nisim Qeynan reports 
that the prisoners, most of whom were released from Qezi'ot 
prison, are now being driven home by bus. 
  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin decided to release the 
prisoners 
as a goodwill gesture prior to the resumption of the Taba talks. 
The prisoners belong to organizations that support the 
political process. None of them were convicted of either murder 
or manslaughter.

<F P=106> [Interview with Shimon Peres, foreign minister, by </F>
correspondent Jon Snow; Peres in Tel Aviv and Snow in the London 
studio; from the "Channel Four" program--live] 
  [Text] [Snow] Foreign Minister, three months down the road 
from the Washington handshake are you running out of time with 
your own electorate? 
  [Peres] No, I don't think so. You know a government is not a 
hospital, we don't have to take the temperature every morning 
and we shall be judged by the end of the process which I am sure 
will be a successful one. 
  [Snow] Now on Monday [10 January] you meet again in Taba 
with 
the PLO. Is that a last chance encounter as far as the 
Gaza-Jericho deal goes? 
  [Peres] We have still a long list of problems that should be 
solved, we are doing something which is unprecedented, we are 
doing something that you cannot draw any lessons from another 
experiment. So it takes time and we encounter problems that we 
didn't anticipate, but I am sure we shall go down the road -- it 
may take a month more or a month less, it doesn't matter, we 
shall arrive at the destination. 
  [Snow] Is one of the biggest problems that's arisen since 
September been the question of whether Yasir 'Arafat really any 
longer leads a significant body of Palestinians with whom you 
can negotiate? 
  [Peres] I wouldn't buy it. I think most of the Palestinians 
support peace, and maybe they support the PLO because they 
support peace, not the other way around. They need peace, we 
need peace, this is the naked truth which will accompany us more 
and more in the future. 
  [Snow] Are you having to pursue a twin-track approach on 
this 
-- in other words are you in fact talking at some level with 
Hamas? 
  [Peres] No, I don't think so. Hamas is clearly against 
peace, Hamas is clearly against the PLO, Hamas is trying to kill 
the people who support peace and to bring an end to peace 
itself, so I do not seen any room for compromise with Hamas. 
  [Snow] Then presumably speed is of the essence however 
complex these last negotiations that you describe are. You 
surely have only got very limited time before you have somehow 
got to ... 
  [Peres, interrupting] Why? 
  [Snow] Well, because presumably with the passage of time 
frustration builds, support for Hamas is likely to build and the 
people with whom you are talking presumably become less relevant? 
  [Peres] I am not sure. Well, anyway we have suggested the 
plan. The timing is in the hands of the Palestinians, if they 
want to make it fast it is OK with us, if they want to go slow 
it is their business. We would surely like to do it as soon as 
possible and as speedy as we can, but if they will try to 
postpone, to interrupt, to hesitate, it is their problem. We do 
not seek in any way to humiliate the Palestinians or to hurt 
their feelings, on the contrary we would like to see them in a 
dignified position, feeling well, feeling strong, feeling 
successful. Our only consideration is the security problems of 
Israel, but basically we would like to see this Palestinian 
story becoming a success story. We feel very strongly the 
better the neighbor feels, the better a neighbor we are having. 
  [Snow] Foreign Minister, you have proved yourself an 
optimist 
by ever going to Washington in the first place to shake hands ... 
  [Peres, interrupting] May I ask you, is it right to be an 
optimist or a pessimist, what can you do with pessimism? 
  [Snow] Let me ask you with your optimistic hat on what are 
the chances then that this deal will go through and that we will 
see a settlement say within eight weeks? 
  [Peres] No, eight weeks I wouldn't take, but it will go 
through undoubtedly. I suggest we have not the slightest 
reluctance or hesitation about our capacity and our 
determination for peace. 
  [Snow] But the timetable? 
  [Peres] I don't know, it may take weeks it may take months. 
I wish it would take weeks, but how can I tell how long it will 
take if I don't know yet what sort of problems we shall have to 
negotiate about. Until now I can say that we are able to 
overcome extremely complicated situations with ingenuity, with 
creativity, and since we see before our eyes a clear-cut goal, a 
clear-cut destination, and nobody will move us aside or derail 
us from the peace process. I am sure we shall arrive at the 
appointed station.

  [Text] Syrian Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam 
recently spoke in public about the possibility of Syria 
recognizing Israel and normalizing relations with it within the 
framework of the peace negotiations. These issues, Khaddam 
said, are part of the negotiations, and it is too early to 
decide on the format of relations. 
  Political sources in Jerusalem told our political 
correspondent Shlomo Raz that this is the first time that a 
senior Syrian statesman has spoken about normalization. The 
sources noted that prior to the meeting between Presidents 
Clinton and al-Asad, there has been an increase in positive 
statements coming from Damascus with regard to the peace process.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq, chief of </F>
staff, by Lieutenant Colonel Orli Lahat, Yanky Galanti, and 
Yo'av Ze'evi; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [BAMAHANE] This year, for 
the first time, we faced calls to refuse to obey orders, 
including one by a general in the reserves, on a massive scale. 
Do these calls hurt the activity of the army, and how is the 
IDF [Israel Defense Forces] preparing to deal with such a 
phenomenon? 
  [Baraq] In my view, the IDF will have no problem with 
carrying out legal orders at any stage. The IDF does not 
determine policy and, as an army, has no stand on the 
arrangement with the Palestinians. It has a professional stand 
on the security issue and makes that known in the relevant 
forums that determine professional issues. The IDF's 
professional stand relates to security -- how to defend 
ourselves against an external threat; how to defend the 
settlements; what security can be provided on the roads -- in 
view of the government decision to leave the population centers 
and to transfer responsibility for public order and security 
there to the Palestinian police force. I reiterate: The IDF 
has no stand on the political aspect of the government's 
resolutions and will not have one in the future, due to the very 
nature of the relationship between the Army and the government. 
On the other hand, the IDF, as the Army of a democratic state, 
carries out the decisions of the elected government -- any 
elected government. That was the situation up to now, that is 
the situation now, and that will be the situation in the future. 
The IDF carries out the security aspect of the government's 
decisions to the best of its abilities. 
  There are hundreds of thousands of soldiers in the Army and 
tens of thousands of officers who, as civilians, express the 
entire spectrum of political views held in this country. 
Therefore, it is legitimate and even good that as citizens, 
they have a view, because after all, they belong to a democratic 
state. They express that view once every four years by putting 
what they think is the right slip in the ballot box and, by 
doing so, elect a government. The elected government is the one 
that instructs and guides the IDF. 
  Recruits, members of the standing army, and officers do not 
express political views when in uniform. They implement the 
army's orders, which stem from Israel's elected government (that 
is the basis of a democracy). Therefore, any soldier, when in 
uniform, must carry out all the legal orders he receives from 
his commander regardless of his political views. I expect any 
group of reservists and any commander who are right-wing 
supporters to carry out -- without hesitation or appeal -- an 
order to detain a group of Israeli settlers that tries to break 
into a closed area near the synagogue in Jericho, because they 
are in uniform. To the same extent, I expect any group of 
soldiers, regardless of whether they are drafted or in the 
reserves, who happen to belong to There Is a Limit or Peace Now 
to disperse rioting Palestinian women and children with resolve 
and without a second thought. 
  If an order is given, it must be carried out. That is the 
basis of a democracy, and we must all understand that. The IDF 
exists in order to defend, and it is ready to do anything to 
uphold the right of every citizen to believe what he wants and 
to struggle to convince the government and the public of the 
rightness of his path. 
  The citizen must do this in a way that is in total 
conformity 
with the rules of democracy. Therefore, I occasionally appeal 
to the Israeli residents of Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza to try to 
express their political protests within the Green Line to the 
extent possible, in order to avoid diverting the IDF from its 
main mission of pursuing wanted men and safeguarding the 
security of the settlers themselves. 
  [BAMAHANE] Does [former Army chief chaplain] Rabbi Goren not 
understand that? 
  [Baraq] I have not even read what Goren said. From my 
viewpoint, what people say is unimportant. Anyone who disobeys 
a legal order in the army will find himself in jail -- period -- 
even if the order touches on an issue which he, as a civilian or 
as a member of the government, would have voted for or conducted 
differently. In my view, there is currently no danger of 
soldiers refusing to obey orders, and if there are isolated 
cases among hundreds of thousands of soldiers, they will find 
themselves in prison. [passage omitted]

  [Text] A confrontation has developed in the last few 
minutes between settlers, who had blocked the Qalqilyah-Nabulus 
road near the Tzofim settlement, and IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
soldiers. Our correspondent Gil Litman reports that members of 
the security forces have started forcibly removing Tzofim 
settlers who are sitting in the road, blocking it to protest 
what they term the deteriorating state of security in the area. 
  Our correspondent adds that several settlers have been 
detained, and the IDF is now proceeding with an evacuation. A 
traffic jam has been created by the fracas. The IDF has 
declared the site a closed military zone.

forces at the Tzofim junction on the Qalqilyah-Nabulus road 
ended a short while ago. Our correspondent Gil Litman reports 
that about 10 settlers were detained and some settlers were 
injured in the course of the confrontation. The head of the 
Samaria Local Council acted to soothe the flaring tempers. Army 
and police troops are still in the area, which was declared a 
closed military zone. The settlers were protesting the 
deteriorating state of security.

<F P=106> [Article by Ari'el Sharon: "A Smoke Screen"] </F>
  [Text] Once the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense 
Committee [FADC], as well as other bodies that deal with 
security issues, used to keep their discussions more secret. In 
these new times, everything is open, there are no barriers and 
no brakes. 
  Several days ago, as the citizens of Israel were anxiously 
listening to accounts of the Cairo encounter between the Israeli 
foreign minister and PLO representative Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 
'Abbas], the media again announced, citing a "soothing" 
statement by the head of the FADC's intelligence branch: "A 
majority of the residents of the territories support 'Arafat." 
  Those who took pains to make this announcement in such a 
manner must have had good reasons to try to calm the public in 
view of the rising doubts, the uncertainty, the growing mistrust 
of the government announcements. 
  I do not discuss the FADC sessions as a rule, and I have 
even 
requested that others refrain from disclosing my remarks at 
these sessions. But a situation has arisen in which the 
government makes cynically selective use of the information it 
receives from intelligence elements, and there is therefore no 
alternative but to present a fuller picture. I trust the 
military censor to delete anything that can be really 
detrimental to state security. 
  Recently all the intelligence elements have been repeatedly 
reporting on 'Arafat's negotiating stands. In general, they 
believe that 'Arafat has firmly adhered to his stands since the 
beginning of the negotiations, not budging from them one bit. 
  And this is what the intelligence elements are saying: 
  -- As far as 'Arafat is concerned, the agreement should lead 
to the establishment of a Palestinian state in Judaea, Samaria, 
and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as its capital, at the end of the 
process. Anything that serves this purpose is acceptable to him. 
Whatever does not, is rejected by him. 
  -- In the matter of the border crossings control, the 
struggle is not over "Palestinian dignity versus Israeli 
security." The struggle is over external manifestations of 
Palestinian sovereignty versus Israeli security. Even if 
'Arafat's demands on the matter of dignity are satisfied, the 
crisis will not be resolved without Israeli concession on the 
matter of external manifestations of sovereignty. (Israel has 
in the meantime given in on both the sovereignty and security 
issues.) 
  -- 'Arafat demands guarantees for future stages of the 
process without linking that to him meeting the government's 
expectations from the agreement. The process and every 
implemented stage thereof are irreversible. This is not an 
experiment after which, if it fails, the situation can be 
reversed. 
  -- A prolonged dialogue resulted in an agreement between 
Fatah and Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], which stated: 
The two organizations will not fight each other either in Gaza, 
Jericho, or any other place. This is the authoritative stand of 
the Israeli intelligence services. 
  -- Hamas will be incorporated in the Palestinian 
establishment that will come into being after Israeli 
evacuation. Negotiations are already under way for the 
inclusion of Hamas in the Gaza city council (proportional to 
their strength, which is about 40 percent of the Strip versus 50 
percent Fatah and 10 percent Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine). 
  They will presumably be incorporated in every Palestinian 
self- administration branch, including the police. 
Hamas-initiated terrorist operations will continue even if and 
when its members join the Palestinian establishment. In all the 
contacts between the two organizations, Fatah has never demanded 
that Hamas discontinue its terrorist activities against Israel. 
  The intelligence elements believe that, during the interim 
period, terrorism is expected to intensify in Judaea and 
Samaria, and in other places in Israel. Fatah and its leader, 
'Arafat, regard terrorism an important tool in the political 
process. Knowing the Israeli public's sensitivity to terror 
victims, 'Arafat hopes to extract additional concessions from 
Israel with the help of intensified terrorism, 
  There is no Fatah agreement that, after the evacuation, 
Israeli security forces will be allowed to carry out preemptive 
acts when Israel has information regarding preparations for 
terror activity. Fatah will also not allow the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] to pursue the perpetrators of terrorism. 
  -- The PLO will not revoke the Palestinian Covenant which 
calls for the destruction of Israel, even in the future. 
  -- 'Arafat does not intend to distance the PLO from the 
terror organizations which have always opposed the agreement 
("the rejectionist front"), and which call for the 
intensification of activity against Israel. Furthermore, he 
does not sanction them. 
  -- After the IDF evacuation, it will be impossible to 
identify or supervise those who carry guns. The Palestinian 
forces will be armed with assault rifles, machine guns, and 
armored vehicles. 
  -- Even if Israel learns, in advance, of an intention to 
shell Sederot from the Gaza area, or Kfar Sava from Qalqilyah, 
the only option at our disposal will be an appeal for the PLO 
interference. 
  Fatah continues perpetrating terror acts, such as the recent 
incidents: the murder last weekend of the immigrant Anatoliy 
Kalasnikov, may the Lord revenge his blood. The stabbing of 
Yuval Golan in Adorayim two days ago, perpetrated by a Fatah man 
who was released from jail, upon a Fatah request, 10 days 
earlier. He probably was a new recruit with the Palestinian 
police, as was one of the murderers of Hayim Mizrahi from Bet 
El.... 
  All of this has been reported to the members of the FADC, 
but 
not published. This was no accident, because they are putting 
out a smoke screen. 
  Possibly, some Jews want to be cheated. Our history has 
witnessed terrible times when the leaders of the ghettos and 
many of the Jews there acted this way (I find it hard to judge 
this because I was not there), and the results are known. 
  Nevertheless, it is important that we know the truth which 
is 
often being hidden from us. It is essential that we know that 
there is nothing left of the government's grounding assumption 
before the agreement is implemented. Let no one later say: "We 
had no idea." Everything is in front of us.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] While the world is looking with hope and confidence 
to the Syrian-U.S. summit in Geneva mid-January, Israeli Housing 
Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer has inaugurated a new quarter in 
the Qatzrin settlement in the occupied Syrian Golan. He also 
distributed 500 housing units to extremist Jews who publicly 
insist they will stay on this Syrian territory and not give it 
back to its owners, even in return for peace. 
  The Israeli minister has pledged to develop and expand 
Zionist settlements on the Golan. Naturally, Ben-Eli'ezer was 
assigned by the Rabin government to carry out this blatant, 
provocative action, which is part of new-old scheme to undermine 
the peace process, sabotage the U.S. initiative, circumvent in 
advance the results of the Clinton-al-Asad summit, and put the 
United States and the world face to face with a fait accompli. 
  Everybody knows that Israel has tried, since the signing of 
the Oslo agreement, to mislead the world and the United States 
by claiming that peace has been established in the region, that 
the Palestine question has been resolved, and that peace efforts 
on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks can be put on hold. 
  Furthermore, Israel has feverishly sought to marginalize 
Syria's role, exclude Security Council resolutions, and replace 
the objective of a just and comprehensive peace with separate 
deals, such as the Gaza-Jericho agreement. However, all these 
misleading attempts did not last long. The Americans, and the 
world, have discovered that the Oslo agreement will not lead to 
peace and that it has created new obstacles to a comprehensive 
solution in the Middle East. 
  It was not merely a courtesy that Secretary Christopher 
praised Syria's key role in the peace process and arranged for a 
summit meeting between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton. Since 
the announcement of the summit, the Israelis have cast doubt on 
the point behind it and leaked misleading information about an 
alleged Syrian role in this or that incident. Their maneuvers, 
however, did not find any response. So they decided to move 
from casting doubts to provocation. Thus, they encouraged 
Zionist settlers to settle on the Golan and pledged to provide 
all possible assistance to expand the existing settlements. 
This was done in the hope of perplexing the Clinton 
administration and planting mines to obstruct serious U.S. 
efforts to advance the peace process on the Syrian and Lebanese 
tracks. 
  The Israelis and the entire world know perfectly well that 
peace in the Middle East is impossible without Syria's effective 
participation. They also know that peace with Syria depends on 
returning all of the occupied Golan and evacuating the settlers. 
The Israelis and the world further know that when Syria says no, 
it means what is says. Syria will not relinquish any territory 
or rights; nor will it bargain over any inch of territory or any 
rights. If Israel does not want peace and is seeking separate 
deals that bolster occupation and usurpation, then the 
international community knows there can be no peace in the 
Middle East until it rests on the principles of justice and 
right and UN resolutions. Certainly there can be no peace 
without Syria's effective participation. 
  Inasmuch as Syria believes in and works for a just and 
comprehensive peace, it adheres to its occupied territory and 
those of the Arabs and resists blackmail and relinquishment. 
  The Golan is Syrian and shall remain so, whatever 
settlements 
Israel builds on it. Syria will not relinquish an iota of the 
Golan. Certainly, there will be no peace in the region or with 
Syria without the full return of the Golan to its kinsfolk and 
sons. 
  Such familiar provocative Israeli policies can only 
undermine the chances for peace. This requires that the 
international community have a firm stance. Peace is the cause 
of all nations, and it can no longer remain silent on Israel's 
deliberate sabotage of U.S. and international peace efforts.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "There Can Be No Peace Unless All 
Golan Territory is Restored," the newspaper TISHRIN comments on 
the constant Israeli provocations and attempts to scuttle the 
peace process and forestall the expected positive outcome of the 
al-Asad-Clinton summit. 
  TISHRIN says: It is clear that all Israeli provocations are 
part of a carefully-studied plan to cast doubts on the 
usefulness of the Syrian-U.S. summit, which the entire world 
views as important and extremely vital for activating the peace 
process and ending the current stalemate. Regional developments 
have shown the falsehood of Israeli arguments that the Syrian 
and Lebanese tracks of negotiations are unimportant. These 
arguments have proven to be baseless. This is because events 
have shown that Syria's role is crucial, and that it is 
impossible to achieve peace in the Middle East without Syria's 
involvement or participation. It was no coincidence that U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced in occupied 
Jerusalem in the aftermath of talks he held with Rabin and Peres 
during his recent tour of the region that the United States is 
interested in achieving a comprehensive and durable peace in the 
Middle East, and that Syria demonstrated genuine and serious 
cooperation with the efforts to achieve peace. What nurtured 
the Americans' convictions regarding the need to achieve 
comprehensive and just peace were the deadlock reached by the 
Gaza-Jericho accord, as well as the deterioration of the overall 
situation in all occupied territories. 
  TISHRIN affirms that Israel is preparing for war, rather 
than 
peace. It is not unlikely that Israel will mobilize the Zionist 
lobby in the United States and the West to bring pressure to 
bear on the U.S. Administration to make it back down on the 
objective of achieving just and comprehensive peace. Likewise, 
it is not unlikely that Israel will exacerbate the situation in 
southern Lebanon and the region. For Israel believes that peace 
must result in the endorsement of its expansionist plans and 
settlement ambitions. It is looking forward to swallowing up 
the Golan, Jerusalem, and most occupied territories, the paper 
argues. 
  The paper believes that the impudence of Zionist settlers 
has 
reached the limit when they said that President Clinton does not 
have the right to discuss the issue of the occupied Golan. This 
is a serious development, particularly since the Golan issue 
has, since 1967, continued to be debated by the world community, 
not to mention that this community has passed several 
resolutions on it, all of which called for Israeli withdrawal 
from the Golan. 
  The paper believes that Israel and Jewish settlers are 
robbing the world community of its prerogatives and 
responsibilities. By so doing, the settlers are posing a 
serious threat to the entire world community. 
  Concluding its commentary, TISHRIN says: The Golan is Syrian 
territory, and will remain so. No single Zionist settler will 
experience comfort or peace as long as the Golan is occupied. 
Moreover, regional peace is contingent, first and foremost, upon 
a complete Israeli withdrawal. Indeed, there can be no peace 
unless this withdrawal takes place. 
  Under the headline "The Credible Syrian Positions," the 
newspaper AL-THAWRAH addresses the same issue, saying: The 
regional developments that have been unfolding since the signing 
of the Oslo agreement have proven beyond any shadow of doubt 
that any unfair agreement is doomed to failure. Moreover, any 
agreement that is not comprehensive is unviable. For, as the 
regional conflict is an indivisible whole, and as the occupation 
of the Golan, southern Lebanon, and the other occupied Arab 
territories is an indivisible whole, the solution itself is an 
indivisible whole. The conclusion of separate deals, as well as 
claims that there is a need to delay progress on some tracks to 
allow for digesting an agreement on a single track are useless. 
Syria has warned against the consequences of accepting separate 
deals, regardless of the television stunts and the high-falutin 
words and terms used to promote them. Israel's policy is to 
promote separate deals to foment inter-Arab divisions, hold on 
to the occupied territories, or, at least, part of them, 
blackmail Arab sides one at a time, and undermine the 
foundations of just and comprehensive peace, which is not in the 
interest of Israel's aggressive plans. 
  Concluding its commentary, AL-THAWRAH says: Undoubtedly, the 
Syrian position is the mainstay of the full-blown Arab position 
in terms of preparation and coordination. This position is 
necessary for proceeding with the peace process to achieve a 
comprehensive and just solution, which is firmly advocated by 
Syria. Syria will not allow Israel to torpedo the components of 
just and comprehensive peace, particularly since the entire 
world in general, and the United States in particular are well 
aware that the achievement of peace is contingent upon a 
complete Israeli withdrawal. Likewise, they are well aware that 
Syria cannot bargain over this principle. 
  Under the headline "Various Means To Achieve The Same End," 
the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: The Israeli rulers' current 
positions have shown that their daily jargon is divorced from 
any frank or clear handling of the facts and terms which could 
result in the achievement of true peace in the region. These 
rulers have persisted with their acts and practices, which are 
bound to torpedo the peace process, although the entire world 
community has reached the conclusion that separate and partial 
agreements cannot produce peace, nor even help achieve security 
and stability, and defuse conflicts and disputes in the Middle 
East. 
  The paper adds: The Israeli rulers have continued to 
circumvent substantive issues in the peace process to turn this 
process into empty slogans, which they are using on the 
international scene to obtain huge funds under the guise of 
developing the Palestinian territories and launching what they 
call a new Middle East, in which Israel would have the upper 
hand. By so doing, Israel seeks to be in a position to control 
the region's resources and destiny, and determine the fate of 
its future generations. 
  The paper goes on to say: We in Syria have always been 
sincere in our efforts to achieve just and comprehensive peace. 
Similarly, we have been sincere in our respect for 
international legitimacy and its resolutions. Given this 
sincerity, we are extremely concerned about the foundations of 
the peace process. We also want to restore our territories and 
rights. The Israeli rulers, as well as the U.S. Administration, 
which launched the peace initiative, are well aware that it is 
impossible to achieve peace in this region as long as Israel 
continues to reject the principle of trading land for peace, and 
to oppose the implementation of the relevant UN resolutions. 
  Concluding its commentary, AL-BA'TH says: Syria will always 
remain willing to cooperate with any international endeavor to 
achieve just, comprehensive, and honorable peace in the region. 
But, under no circumstances will it accept the version of peace 
that would result in abandoning rights, territories, and dignity.

  [Text] Under the headline "The Summit and the Principles of 
Peace," AL-THAWRAH comments on the importance of the expected 
Syrian-U.S. Geneva summit and of the sensitive topics and issues 
that Presidents al-Asad and Clinton are expected to discuss. 
The paper says that in light of the big hopes pinned on this 
summit and its results and positive impact on the future of the 
region and world peace as a whole, and in view of the serious 
situation in this region, this summit can be described as 
historic and exceptional. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds: There is no doubt that in view of Syria's 
weight and central role, it is impossible to achieve peace 
without Syria. Besides, President al-Asad symbolizes Arab 
strength and dignity as well as wisdom, courage, sound views, 
and commitment to national and pan-Arab stands and principles. 
Therefore, the world has tesfied to this leadership's 
efficiency and sound stands. The other side to the meeting and 
dialogue, represented by the United States and President Bill 
Clinton, is a superpower and a sponsor of the peace process. It 
possesses all that is needed to influence Israel. All this 
lends importance to the Geneva summit and enhances optimism that 
the summit may come out with decisive results which will save 
the peace process and push it toward its aspired objective on 
all tracks. 
  Concluding its comment, AL-THAWRAH stresses that Syria's 
terms for peace are constant and have not changed. For this 
peace to be just and comprehensive, it must cover all tracks and 
fronts and must be based on the Madrid terms of reference and 
full implementation of the resolutions of international 
legitimacy and on the spirit of the U.S. initiative calling for 
trading land for peace.

  [Excerpt] Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, the information minister 
and minister of state for Prime Ministry affairs, met at his 
office in the Information Ministry today with a British press 
team accompanying the British foreign secretary on his visit to 
Jordan. 
  Details in the following report: Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, the 
information minister and minister of state for Prime Ministry 
affairs, briefed the delegation on the developments in the peace 
process since the announcement of the Declaration of Principles 
between the PLO and Israel and the impact of this agreement on 
Jordan as a result of its relations with the occupied Arab 
territories. 
  He said that developments on the Palestinian-Israeli track 
clearly affect the course of Jordanian negotiations and Jordan's 
basic interests. He said: We are now coordinating with the 
Palestinian brothers in order to unify stands and avoid any 
contradictions or negative aspects between the two sides in the 
future. 
  He said that Jordan believes that peace should be just and 
comprehensive and that all parties should get their rights with 
all due respect and appreciation, especially Jordanian and 
Palestinian interests. 
  Following the meeting, BBC television held an interview with 
Information Minister Dr. Jawad al-'Anani. 
  [Begin al-'Anani recording, in English] You know Jordan was 
the only country which opened its borders with the Palestinians 
and kept them open since the war of 1967. And, therefore, you 
know, there have been cumulative rights over time, there have 
been entangled business relations and so on. We don't want to 
sound like we are engaging in a tug of war, you know, who should 
win the West Bank. But it is not a question either of a zero 
option. But we believe that the fact that the Israelis have 
complete dominance over the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, by 
virtue of occupation, if we can use the word virtue, but at the 
same time Jordan seems to be on the paying end of the equation. 
[sentence as heard] This development should really be reversed 
because Jordan has put a great deal of sacrifice. [end 
recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Positive View of Jordanian Role"] </F>
  [Text] After a tour of a number of Middle Eastern countries 
and at the conclusion of talks with His Majesty King Husayn and 
ranking officials, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said 
that Jordan plays a basic role in this part of the world and 
that a just and comprehensive peace cannot be achieved without 
an effective Jordanian role. 
  The British foreign secretary did well when he recognized, 
at 
close hand, not only the importance of Jordan's role but the 
extent of economic difficulties which Jordan finds itself facing 
from time to time -- economic difficulties caused by this role 
Jordan is playing and as a result of its moderate and realistic 
policies. 
  There is no doubt that such an appreciation of Jordan's role 
is good and a source of pride for all of us. However, this 
prompts us to say that this role should be maintained and 
supported by all possible means, foremost of which is helping 
Jordan overcome its economic difficulties that, in fact, were a 
result of continuous political developments. The most recent of 
these developments is the forced immigration of thousands of 
citizens during the Gulf crisis. 
  It was important for the British foreign secretary to also 
notice that despite what has been accomplished on the 
Jordanian-Israeli track, it is not yet time to sign any 
agreement with Israel. This is because more efforts should be 
made before signing any agreement in order to achieve balanced 
progress on all the other negotiating tracks until Jordan's goal 
of achieving a just and comprehensive peace in the region is 
realized. 
  Jordan is delighted by this British appreciation of its 
role. 
It also hopes that all this appreciation will be accompanied by 
economic support. Such economic support includes writing off 
Jordan's debts, alleviating its problems resulting from the 
implementation of UN sanctions on Iraq, and developing some 
programs and various projects, including water projects This is 
especially since Jordan is aware of the seriousness of the 
dangers which could threaten its agricultural and industrial 
projects if the water issue is not tackled.

<F P=106> [Randah Habib dispatch from Amman] </F>
  [Text] At a time when the Jordanian-Palestinian talks are 
being held in Amman for the second consecutive day to launch a 
serious dialogue between the two sides, an atmosphere of 
frustration has prevailed these talks, and it seems they will 
not produce any positive results. King Husayn had earlier 
stressed that these talks will be the last opportunity to 
rectify the situation following the PLO's continuous 
procrastination. 
  Observers believe that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's 
decision to send Faruq Qaddumi to Amman, taking into 
consideration that the latter is not informed of the 
coordination file, unlike Mahmud 'Abbas, Abu-Mazin, reflects 
'Arafat's desire to procrastinate and gain time, especially 
since the Palestinian delegation is expected to ask for time to 
hold consultations with the leadership in Tunis, something which 
will lead to revolving in the same vicious circle. 
  An authorized Jordanian source has stressed that Jordan has 
the feeling that 'Arafat gives priority to coordination with 
Israel at the expense of coordination with Jordan. The source 
noted that Amman does not want to get involved in the whirlpool 
of turning the conflict from a Palestinian-Israeli conflict into 
a Palestinian-Jordanian conflict. However, the source added, 
Amman holds the PLO responsible for the repercussions of the 
failure of the dialogue in Amman, and the additional suffering 
this would cause to the Palestinian people inside the occupied 
territories.

  [Text] Amman, Jan 6 (AFP)--Jordan fears PLO chief Yasir 
'Arafat has ignored its ultimatum to improve cooperation on 
Palestinian autonomy and that fence-mending talks here are 
doomed to failure, Jordanian sources said Thursday [6 January]. 
  "No accord will be reached between the two sides and the 
Palestinian delegation will ask to leave for Tunis for 
consultation with the PLO leadership," a source close to the 
negotiations told AFP. 
  King Husayn had described the talks here as a "last chance" 
to mend ties between the two sides. 
  A Jordanian official told AFP that Jordan feared that 
'Arafat 
"is giving priority to Palestinian-Israeli cooperation rather 
than to that with Jordan" and would blame the PLO leader if the 
talks here failed. 
  The source close to the talks said that 'Arafat's choosing 
Faruq Qaddumi instead of Mahmud 'Abbas to head the negotiations 
here "shows his determination to gain time without making firm 
commitments." 
  Unlike Qaddumi who disagreed with the Israeli-PLO peace 
deal, 
'Abbas signed the accord in Washington and is directly involved 
in all autonomy-related negotiations. 
  The two days of talks focused on how to boost coordination 
on 
banking in the territories, the issues of Jerusalem, water, and 
refugees as well as on the PLO-Israeli negotiations, Jordanian 
Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani said. 
  The talks "will continue until both sides reach decisive 
results," al-'Anani said earlier. 
  King Husayn on Saturday gave the Palestine Liberation 
Organization until Tuesday to begin a "serious" dialogue on 
improving coordination, after the PLO had failed to sign an 
economics agreement that has been ready for two months. 
  The agreement is aimed at setting up Jordanian banks in the 
occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank.

  [Text] The Jordanian and Palestinian negotiators are trying 
to come up with a joint formula after it has been confirmed that 
the PLO will not sign the Jordanian-Palestinian economic 
agreement. 
  A declaration is expected to be issued at the conclusion of 
the talks in Amman tonight on the establishment of a joint 
cooperation committee to implement the financial, monetary, and 
banking policies until the central Palestinian monetary body has 
been established. 
  This declaration is an alternative to the PLO's refusal to 
sign a joint economic agreement, which has been awaiting its 
approval for over two months. This declaration gives Jordan the 
green light to reopen branches of its banks in the West Bank. 
However, the kingdom is more eager to reach a comprehensive 
economic agreement without isolating the issue of the banks, as 
an authoritative Jordanian source said. 
  The joint declaration will include broad outlines on the use 
of the Jordanian dinar in the occupied territory and the 
establishment of banks specialized in development in the fields 
of housing, industry, and agriculture, and will encourage 
investments without discussing details as was the case in the 
joint economic agreement. 
  The Palestinian side has also committed itself to 
participation in the six joint committees as soon as possible.

  [Text] A short while ago, the Jordanian and Palestinian 
negotiators reached a joint agreement which includes the 
formation of a technical committee for cooperation to implement 
the financial, monetary, and banking policies until the 
Palestinian central monetary authority is established. This 
gives Jordan the green light to reopen the branches of its banks 
in the occupied territories under joint supervision of the 
Central Bank of Jordan and the Palestinian Economic Council. 
The two sides have also agreed to use the Jordanian dinar as 
the main currency, along with other Arab and international 
currencies, and to establish banks for development in the fields 
of housing, industry, agriculture, and investment. The two 
sides committed themselves to holding meetings, as soon as 
possible, of the six joint committees, which have been frozen 
for some time. 
  This agreement was reached following three days of 
continuous 
meetings, during which journalists heard arguments and 
discussion. The Jordanians insisted on obtaining a serious PLO 
commitment to coordinating stands in all fields, particularly 
the economic field. 
  The results of these meetings have come as a compromise 
solution in light of the PLO's refusal to sign a joint economic 
agreement, which has been ready for more than two months. The 
two sides have simply committed themselves to the broadlines of 
future policies, leaving to the joint committees the task of 
drafting the details of agreements in the near future.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Jordanian-Palestinian Meetings"] </F>
  [Text] Based on a number of joint principles and amid a 
climate highlighted by common objectives, the 
Jordanian-Palestinian meetings began yesterday in order to 
formulate policies and define mechanisms that would achieve the 
aspirations of the two fraternal peoples. Those two fraternal 
peoples are united by hopes and pains as well as the unity of 
blood, geography, and joint history. 
  There is no doubt that these meetings, which were permeated 
by a true fraternal spirit, are of special importance. Great 
hopes are pinned on these meetings that are accompanied by 
serious challenges. All this should lead to practical results 
that respond to the requirements of this decisive stage and 
support the steadfastness of the Palestinian people on their 
national soil in the occupied territories. 
  These bilateral talks acquire further importance because 
they, in themselves, represent the first link in a series of 
links to achieve required Arab coordination. This is especially 
since it has become clear that Arab coordination is useless 
without previous coordination between the Jordanians and 
Palestinians on whom and on whose course at this level 
everything aspired in terms of broader Arab coordination depends. 
  While defining mechanisms that can translate principles into 
practical steps, the Jordanians and Palestinians are not 
forgetting that they are holding talks at a very critical stage; 
that is, when the initial requirements of the peace process have 
to be met. This give these talks a responsibility that cannot 
but be shouldered, especially since any expected result from 
these talks will strengthen the Palestinian stand and improve 
the PLO's negotiating stand. 
  As we wager on these talks and aspire for results that serve 
both Jordan and Palestine, we are confident that the deep sense 
of serious responsibility and high awareness of the dangers of 
this stage and its possible consequences will push these talks 
toward achieving the desired success and whatever else that can 
reinforce the two peoples' cohesion and strengthen the 
deep-rooted relations between the two fraternal peoples.

<F P=106> [Interview with Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani by </F>
Samir Hijjawi in Amman; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Hijjawi] His majesty the 
king has dropped the idea of confederation for good. What kind 
of relationship will Jordan have with the self-rule authority, 
especially since control of the bridges will most likely be in 
the hands of the Israelis? 
  [Al-'Anani] Not having a decisive stance on the question of 
confederation has given room for many wrong interpretations, 
especially in the West. Those who have an interest in marring 
the relationship between Jordan and the PLO always take any 
Jordanian decision or stand to mean that Jordan plans to go back 
on the decision of disengagement [of ties to the West Bank]. 
His majesty the king wanted to make this point very clear. We 
have an interest in Jerusalem: We want Jerusalem to be Arab and 
Islamic and we want the holy places to be safeguarded. 
  Jordan did not create this situation. It is the nature of 
the Declaration of Principles that created this situation, 
because the Declaration of Principles has deferred the question 
of Jerusalem until the final phase after five years. We know 
that when Jordan relinquished the geographic jurisdiction in the 
West Bank, including Jerusalem, it wanted the Palestinians to 
take over. But if we are going to have a vacuum for five years 
regarding the question of Jerusalem, then this means that the 
holy places, under Israeli measures and court rulings, will be 
subject to control by Israel, as there is no one to claim these 
places on behalf of the Arabs and Muslims. Therefore, his 
majesty explained that this position has to do with Islamic Arab 
interests in Jerusalem, and is not meant to circumvent the 
disengagement decision. 
  [Hijjawi] So there is no going back on the decision of 
disengagement? 
  [Al-'Anani] There is no going back on the disengagement 
decision. There are various views being aired, which we cannot 
control in a country that has freedom of expression. It is 
better to have a constant relationship between Jordan and 
Palestine. We do not want this to be a good framework for bad 
intentions. We do not want something that looks good but 
induces suffering from within. Therefore we have to show 
concern. Showing political concern is not done through goodwill 
alone, but by being extremely careful, intelligent, and using 
one's mind. When we speak about the issue of Jerusalem, we do 
not want the PLO to take this as a Jordanian attempt to 
circumvent the disengagement decision. 
  If there are fears that there will be a confederation in the 
future, we say no. This, however, does not mean that there can 
be no confederation at the choice of the two peoples in the 
future, as part of Arab unity or as part of relations between 
the two countries. This question will be discussed at the 
appropriate time by a decision from the people's base. We 
should remember that there have been more than 500 attempts at 
unity, cooperation, coordination, and integration since World 
War II. Most, or all, of them have failed, because they stemmed 
from political decisions and not from decisions at the grass 
roots. Therefore, his majesty wants to say that this question 
is unthinkable now, and that it will not be discussed now 
because it is not one of Jordan's priorities. The first 
priority is the restoration of the territory and achieving the 
Palestinian people's legitimate rights to self-determination on 
their national soil. I think his majesty was very clear in this 
regard. 
  [Hijjawi] Why do you think the Palestinian side is 
dragging its feet over the signing of the economic agreement 
with Jordan? 
  [Al-'Anani] I do not think they are dragging their feet. It 
is a question of the PLO wanting first to wrap up an agreement 
on Israeli withdrawal and the Gaza-Jericho accord before moving 
to deal with Jordan. On that score, Jordan, however, does not 
necessarily see eye to eye with the PLO. Jordan sees a greater 
need for Arab coordination, which, it argues must be given 
precedence over negotiations with the Israelis. Arabs, Jordan's 
argument runs, must coordinate their policies toward Israel. 
From our standpoint, we do not think an Arab party should give 
preference to coordination with Israel over that with fellow 
Arabs. We have informed our brothers that their negotiations 
with Israel are bound to affect us directly. Hence the need for 
them to coordinate with us. As an important player in this 
equation and at this crucial state, there can be no disregarding 
our interests. We are pressing for coordination in the best 
interests of our two countries. We are speaking from 
experience. We should not lose sight of the importance that 
must be attached to the right order of priorities. Let us first 
coordinate among ourselves as Arabs and then approach Israel 
with a united negotiating strategy. 
  [Hijjawi] There is a memorandum of understanding and nine 
protocols between the Jordanians and Israelis. 
  [Al-'Anani] No, there are no protocols in existence. There 
is an agenda made up of items addressing particular topics. 
There are no protocols or annexes or agreements. Other than 
the items on the joint agenda, there is nothing. 
  [Hijjawi] In light of the recent events, will the opening 
of Jordanian bank branches in the West Bank and Gaza Strip be 
frozen? 
  [Al-'Anani] A decision will be made at the appropriate time, 
and I do not want to judge things prematurely. We presume that 
the banks should be reopened in the West Bank, and that this 
plan should pass through legal channels, so Jordan will endorse 
it. We are eager to do so. 
  [Hijjawi] Have you been acquainted with what is agreed on in 
the Paris economic meetings between the Palestinian and Israeli 
sides? 
  [Al-'Anani] We are little acquainted with these meetings. 
Thus, we stress the need for coordination. A call for 
coordination should stem from the need for consultation and 
acquainting others with what is happening. This is so because 
what is taking place in Paris will have a profound effect on us. 
  [Hijjawi] How will you deal with the results of the Paris 
negotiations? 
  [Al-'Anani] We do not know what these results will be, so I 
cannot tell how we will deal with them. However, we can deal 
with such results through coordination. For this reason, we 
call for coordination. 
  [Hijjawi] Why does the Palestinian side refrain from 
coordinating with the Jordanian side? 
  [Al-'Anani] It is not a matter of refraining but of 
interpretations concerning the priorities. 
  [Hijjawi] To what extent will the Central Bank of Jordan 
control the Jordanian currency that will remain in circulation 
in the self-rule areas? 
  [Al-'Anani] We should recall that the Jordanian dinar is 
currently available in the West Bank thanks to the open-bridges 
policies and also because our kinsfolk in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip prefer to deal with the Jordanian dinar than with other 
currencies, particularly the Israeli shekel. Thus, the 
existence of bank channels will make Jordan more capable of 
organizing the currency affairs by organizing and supervising 
the work of such banks. 
  [Hijjawi] What are the possible threats to the Jordanian 
dinar? 
  [Al-'Anani] The Jordanian currency is at risk due to Israeli 
measures whether banks are there or not. We learned that 
immediately after the [1967] occupation, Israel sold Jordanian 
dinars in the market, and Jordan had to purchase these dinars in 
hard currency. Moreover, Israel tried to counterfeit the 
Jordanian currency, but we changed that currency. However, 
preserving the Jordanian dinar in the territories should be done 
through an institutional coordination with clear features. This 
can probably be accomplished through the Jordanian banks. 
  [Hijjawi] Your Excellency the Minister: What points were 
discussed during 'Arafat's recent visit to Jordan? 
  [Al-'Anani] Cordial and frank talks were held between His 
Majesty King Husayn and President 'Arafat. Coordination and 
joint action was emphasized. Also stressed was the fact that 
coordination, which we used to talk about, should be 
crystallized within a clear and consistent framework. It was 
also emphasized that all issues should be clearly and frankly 
discussed in an atmosphere of complete trust. I believe that 
these were the pivotal points of discussions. 
  [Hijjawi] But his majesty's recent speech clearly indicates 
that the meeting was not fruitful? 
  [Al-'Anani] I do not think that it reads that way. As I said 
at the beginning, his majesty's speech was devoted to 
highlighting the importance of coordination between the two 
sides, that there is no time left for any delay in this 
coordination. 
  [Hijjawi] It seems that, on the other side, there is 
flirtation going on between the government and the ten 
Palestinian factions [based in Damascus]. Perhaps this is 
indicated by George Habash's recent statements that viewpoints 
are now closer. Do you consider that this is a Jordanian 
gesture to the other side of the PLO that Jordan can play the 
Palestinian opposition card? 
  [Al-'Anani] Jordan never plays cards in the Palestinian 
problem. Jordan wants the PLO to be strong, capable of assuming 
its serious responsibilities under the shadow of negotiations 
and in view of the difficult tasks inherent in its decisions. 
We want all the Palestinian factions to be united. We want 
their differences to be confined to them, without affecting the 
Palestinian unity of ranks or reducing their ability to 
negotiate in the best way possible. 
  Our door in Jordan is open to whoever wants to come to us. 
We would welcome him even if his opinion is different from 
ours. I do not think we will be intolerant. However, the basic 
problem is that whenever a decision is made, we are confronted 
by allegations that we want this or that, or are playing that. 
It is well-known that Jordan does not play political or 
nonpolitical cards. Jordan behaves reasonably and objectively 
within its principles. It believes in the need to reach a just 
and comprehensive and just peace that will first and foremost 
serve the Palestinian interests and solve the Palestinian 
problem because without such a solution to this problem, which 
is the crux of the Arab-Israeli dispute, there will be no 
peaceful solution. As for Dr. Habash's visit, the man has 
visited Jordan several times in the past. To give the visit 
special interpretations at this time is simply trying to be too 
clever in analyzing. 
  [Hijjawi] Some say that if Syria signs an agreement with the 
Israeli side, the Palestinian factions would find a political 
center for themselves in Jordan. What do you say to that? 
  [Al-'Anani] These are mere speculations and interpretations 
that serve only non-Arab interests. Jordan is very clear. It 
wants the PLO to be capable of confronting the challenges. 
Jordan does not use cards. I have no answer to your question 
except the one I gave to your previous question. [passage

  [Text] A group of Jordanian figures has sent a memorandum 
to House of Representatives Speaker Tahir al-Masri and members 
of the House. The memorandum values the House's efforts to 
spread freedom and democracy in order to fulfill the 
requirements of the pan-Arab project. 
  The memorandum refers to the continued detention by the 
Syrian authorities of a number of Jordanian political prisoners, 
including pan-Arab struggler Dafi al-Jam'ani, who has been 
imprisoned for 23 years without trial, and without any charges 
being brought against him, and who is considered to be the 
world's longest-held political prisoner. 
  The memorandum says that al-Jam'ani is suffering from ill 
health, and appeals to the House of Representatives to take the 
initiative to urge the Syrian president to immediately release 
al-Jam'ani and other political prisoners so that they can return 
to their families after almost three decades of imprisonment.

  [Excerpt] 'Aziz Morad, spokesman for the Afghan president, 
in an interview with the Central News Unit in Kabul spoke of 
current battles in Kabul as a holy war and a second revolution. 
He said: These battles will continue until there is total 
victory over the opposition. 
  He also announced an agreement on a temporary cease-fire to 
transfer the wounded. 
  The spokesman for Rabbani also spoke about heavy clashes in 
northern Afghanistan and around the city of Mazar-e-Sharif and 
denied the announcement of any cease-fire in that city. 
  'Aziz Morad said three areas in the Faryab Province, in 
northern Afghanistan, have come under the control of forces of 
General Esmai'l Khan, an important commander of Jami'at-e Eslami 
[Islamic Society of Afghanistan] in western Afghanistan. 
  Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan] and the 
Northern 
Meli-ye Eslami [Islamic Front] Movement say they have also 
achieved fresh victories in the battle fields in northern 
Afghanistan. 
  They announced the main condition for cease-fire is the 
resignation of the president and the formation of a summit 
between the leaders of jehadi and political groups. [passage

  [Excerpt] Kabul, Jan 7 (AFP) -- Thousands fled the Afghan 
capital Friday as calm returned after days of bloody fighting, 
with Premier Golboddin Hekmatyar's party saying he had responded 
"positively" to calls for a temporary ceasefire. 
  Heavy rain and fog over the city may also have contributed 
to 
a grounding of aircraft and the silencing of rival artillery 
fire. 
  With the peace depending on the cooperation of President 
Borhanoddin Rabbani, and his response still unknown, thousands 
of local residents took advantage of the first lull in fighting 
in almost a week to flee with all their belongings. 
  Scores were reported dead and more than 3,000 people wounded 
in the six days of clashes tied to a power struggle in which 
Hekmatyar and his ally, Uzbek warlord 'Abdol Rashid Dostam, have 
been attempting to oust Rabbani. 
  Sources inside the Dostam camp, which has been most active 
in 
Kabul and backed by Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of 
Afghanistan] faction, said he would also accept international 
calls for a brief ceasefire. 
  Pakistan, in a "fervent appeal" Thursday, urged all warring 
Afghan factions in Kabul to agree to a 24-hour truce starting at 
1100 GMT Friday so that all diplomatic and UN personnel living 
in Kabul and civilians wounded since the New Year's day coup 
attempt could be "evacuated on an emergency basis." 
  "There is no problem from our side," Hekmatyar said. 
  In a radio message conveyed to the foreign office from his 
Charasyab base east of Kabul, Hekmatyar said "we can stop 
fighting (from late Friday) to enable UN personnel and foreign 
nationals to leave Kabul" and evacuate casualties. 
  Moreover, hundreds of Afghanis are still trapped in their 
shattered homes awaiting medical asistance. Many who did leave 
were travelling to Kabul's most northerly district, Khairkhana, 
which has been free of shelling. 
  "I don't know where to go but they told me that it is safe 
in 
Khairkhana," said one man leaving the city, Agha Mohammed. "I 
have no relatives there and I have no money to hire even a small 
room, but living in the open is better than getting hit by 
rockets." 
  Mengal Hoseyn, the Afghan premier's representative in 
Islamabad, said Hekmatyar "responded positively" to the 
ceasefire proposal on humanitarian grounds. 
  Asked if Dostam, whose forces are engaged in the battle, 
would also be ready, Hussain said "all forces fighting to oust 
Rabbani will be ready" for a temporary ceasefire, "including 
Dostam."[passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Second Friday prayer sermon by President Hashemi-Rafsanjani </F>
in Tehran on 7 January -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the second sermon, in addition to calling the 
people to piety, the performance of our religious duties, acting 
on what is made obligatory, and shunning that which has been 
forbidden, I wish to refer to the present condition of our 
revolution and our country in pursuance of some of the recent 
remarks of the esteemed leader of the revolution [Khamene'i]. In 
my view, it is an important topic and I hope that our ummah will 
pay special attention to this important topic. 
  Recently, in his remarks the leader has a few times stressed 
an issue to which I feel the media has not paid sufficient 
attention, despite the fact that full attention is usually paid 
to his remarks. That issue, which is a very important issue, is 
his repeated references to the fact that today it is a major sin 
-- an unforgivable sin -- to create despondency among the 
people. He is emphatic on this point and repeatedly refers to 
it. I wish to talk a little concerning these comments. I 
believe that it is an appropriate time to raise this issue, 
because I feel that we are faced with a very dangerous and a 
very mischievous propaganda conspiracy. 
  We have completed one period of reconstruction and we are on 
the threshold of launching the second plan. I wish to provide 
some explanations that are also relevant to our discussion. 
That plan is now being studied by the Majles. I have a very 
clear impression, and there are numerous clues for it, that the 
world arrogance, especially America -- because today it is the 
leader of that propaganda campaign and is guiding those 
pressures -- has realized that the Islamic revolution has 
successfully passed through many dangerous stages that they 
predicted would lead us to a dead end, that the people are 
reaching the stage of necessary confidence, and that the country 
is achieving necessary stability. They are afraid that if this 
revolution, with all that it stands for, achieves full 
political, economic, and cultural stability and if it can 
strengthen its foundations they will no longer be able to damage 
it and the matter will be completely taken out of their hands. 
  You are aware of the previous stages and how they confronted 
us at each stage. Today we are entering a completely new stage, 
and I see that there is an organized propaganda campaign waged 
against us, so that the people may lose their confidence in 
Islam and feel that the revolution and Islam will not be able to 
build the country and will not be able to create prosperity for 
the people. This in short is the essence of the propaganda 
onslaught that is being waged by them today. Its aim is to 
weaken the morale of the people, if they succeed. If they do 
succeed in creating despondency among the people they have 
achieved their greatest goal in history and have prevented a 
danger that threatens the center of world arrogance. They will 
then be able to weaken the general movement that exists in the 
world today. 
  Iran is not their only target. Today you see in some 
newspapers -- there are of course many such reports, but here 
you only see a small portion of it -- that arrogant observers 
have become worried that the wave of Islam has passed beyond the 
borders of Iran, that the new Islam, the Islam that was 
propagated by the Imam [Khomeyni] has transcended Iranian 
frontiers and has penetrated many Islamic countries. Even in 
Western countries it has aroused a great deal of interest among 
the perceptive individuals -- not ordinary people who are 
influenced by propaganda, but people of conscience, people of 
understanding. They have this fear. 
  Therefore, they have to deliver their blow at the base of 
the 
revolution. If here they can persuade the people that this is 
not in their interest, then they have achieved their aim. I am 
sorry that to a large extent they receive the basic material for 
their propaganda from inside our country. Certain people who 
have good intentions and who feel concerned about the country 
raise some minor issues and magnify some difficulties and 
problems to such an extent that immediately you see that Radio 
Israel, BBC Radio, and Voice of America broadcast it back to us. 
And it is not limited to those three radio stations. You notice 
that any small issue that we raise here reverbrates throughout 
the world and gives rise to a flood of special articles in 
newspapers, which are today regarded as the source material for 
the newspapers in the Third World. They are then translated and 
taken to all Islamic countries. 
  It requires special alertness. I get really worried when I 
see that well-intentioned individuals quote certain untrue 
figures and statistics that are contrary to the realities and 
that will only lead to the despondency of the people and make 
them negative. They will weaken the morale of the people or, at 
least, sow the seeds of doubt in them. This is our very serious 
duty -- to mention our positive points, to talk about the 
efforts of these people, the endeavors of this nation, the gains 
of this nation. 
  Perhaps one of the reasons for this -- I am not sure if this 
is the reason -- is that our media is inclined to give 
prominence to negative reports. Those who are interested in 
appearing in the media say something negative, because they see 
that the following day their names and remarks are published in 
big letters on the front pages of newspapers. Of course, a 
person might have said something with good intentions, so that 
he can express what is in his heart. See what is happening in 
the world today, and why the leader of the revolution regards 
this as a major sin. 
  This does not mean that we should not refer to the 
difficulties. It does not mean that we should not criticize. If 
we do not criticize, the issues will not be put right. However, 
one should say these things in such a way that one only refers 
to the facts. If a certain organization wishes to say, for 
instance, that the deprived classes are faced with problems, and 
if it raises a slogan that the bones of the deprived classes are 
being crushed [in last week's Friday prayer sermons Ayatollah 
Jannati used an almost identical sentence saying that the bones 
of deprived classes are being crushed], then he [as heard] 
should also give the correct figures and statistics. He should 
say how much we are spending from the public treasury for the 
deprived classes, how much we are spending in deprived areas, 
how much we are spending on reconstruction, how much we are 
paying in subsidies to them, how cheaply we are selling the 
bread, how cheaply we are selling the fuel, how cheaply we are 
selling vegetable oil, how cheaply we are selling medicine. Let 
him give those figures, and then say that there are also some 
problems, so that the people may know that their treasury, their 
country, their Majles, their government, their leader are 
working for them. However, if one only comes and says that the 
situation is a certain way... [pauses] if one did not know those 
individuals one would have doubted their sincerity. 
  At times, I feel that there are some deceitful, satanic 
individuals who get close to podiums and pens and produce false 
figures, and then it goes into the newspapers. This has 
happened, and whether some people try to make amends for those 
mistakes or not the feeling of despondency will continue. As 
your trusted friend I tell you that with the implementation of 
the First Plan world arrogance realized that it has lost out. 
  They realized the country's problems were solved, that 
there are no more problems. The biggest problem in the country 
was our strong dependence on foreign currency earned from oil 
sales. The West could always bring our country to its knees with 
that weapon. 
  Four or five years into the plan they realized that Iran is 
not as vulnerable as they had thought because we have non-oil 
exports worth at least $5 billion annually. Of course, it is 
about $4 billion in official figures, because those who export 
do not put down true figures. If, for example, their goods are 
worth $1,500, they put down $1,000 in their statements. The 
true figure is higher. We have also saved more than that amount. 
  In many areas we do not need the foreign currency earned 
from 
oil sales. Raw materials for many factories -- steel, 
aluminium, copper, chemicals, and others -- are domestically 
produced. Many intermediary goods are produced by our own 
industries. They make the machinery. 
  The food situation is not like in the past. If we put slight 
pressure on consumption and control the consumption of bread and 
other things, our present grain production would be sufficient 
for our needs. Tea is reaching self-sufficiency. Wheat has had 
a marvelous growth. Chickens have reached self-sufficiency. 
Food in our country is generally no longer imported, except for 
a few items. For example, if we were importing $4 billion worth 
of foodstuffs three years ago, we need to import $1 billion 
today. That is, about a third. 
  I can see that our needs from the outside world have 
decreased. Many of the heavy machinery that you see -- tractors, 
bulldozers, loaders, wagons, locomotives, engines for large and 
small machinery -- a large portion of them are being built by 
our own industries. 
  Our defense industries' requirements were always imported 
and 
we had to undergo a huge expense. We now import practically 
none of our defense needs. 
  It is the same with the chemical industry, which is the most 
important. Oil by-products, which we used to import, we are now 
producing -- most of them ourselves. We are expanding gas to 
replace other fuels. 
  The West realize that our dependence on oil has decreased. 
For that reason, now that they cause a shock and talk about 
dealing us blows, they deal a blow to their own friends. 
  Despite the fact that the price of our oil came down by 
nearly 30 percent in our budget calculations, we submitted our 
budget -- and also the Plan -- to the Majles like that of 1372 
with a different growth figure. 
  This is due to the fact that the infrastructural works 
carried out during the course of the First Plan have yielded 
their intended results, and today the problem of dependence on 
oil has been resolved to a large extent. Of course, if oil 
generates more income, we will naturally be able to work faster. 
For instance, instead of spending $10 billion on 
reconstruction, we will be able to spend $20 billion. However, 
if such an increase is not possible, we will not be facing any 
danger. The speed of work might be reduced, but the country 
will not face any danger. Enough infrastructural works have 
been carried out in our country to meet our needs today. 
  If we do not face any unforeseen event, then we can be 
confident that for the next five years we will have no 
electrical power cuts and black-outs in this country. At 
present, we have connected 200 towns to the national gas 
network, and we are in the process of connecting other towns 
with a great deal of speed. We have taken telephone lines to 
the heart of our rural areas. Our transport system is enjoying 
a full balance, in the sense that we have enough cargo for our 
trucks, while at the same time the cargo does not have to wait 
for trucks. The capacity of our ports has increased from 16 
million tonnes to 28 million tonnes, and at present we do not 
have any problem with our ports. We have, to a large extent, 
harnessed our water resources. Moreover, we are managing to 
meet the needs of our factories for raw material with what we 
produce domestically. Praise be to God, the country does not 
have any problems at the moment. This is exactly the thing that 
has worried the arrogant countries. 
  I have been informed that during confidential meetings 
between Western countries discussing Iran, the Americans have 
stated that this, and not Islamic fundamentalism, is the danger 
they faced. When the right time comes, we will of course reveal 
all this in a documented manner. The Americans have said: This 
constitutes the real danger, and we should not allow Iran to 
develop itself. If Iran manages to accomplish this, then we 
will not be able to do anything. 
  However, we have already passed through this stage during 
the 
course of our first development plan, and it is now too late for 
the Westerners to realize this and enter the arena. If they had 
delivered this petroleum-shock to us four years ago, then there 
would have been danger. Today, however, there is no danger, 
whatever they do. I can confidently tell you, as your expert, 
that even if they stop our oil exports, Iran can still maintain 
its present course and enjoy the same conditions as today. Of 
course, if such a thing were to happen, then the process of 
development would have to slow down. Still, that would not 
constitute a problem. If, for example, we were intent on 
building a factory in two years, we would then have to do it in 
five years. [passage omitted] 
  What, however, is clear is that we have overcome the 
dangers, 
and today the Westerners are intent on disheartening the people. 
This is because the type of work we have carried out can 
naturally have economic and social consequences. 
  The most important thing that we ever did... [pauses] one of 
the most important things that we have done was to reform the 
price systems. They consider this a weak point, however. I 
would like to emphasize that it is absolutely impossible for us 
to be able to reconstruct our country by creating artificial 
prices and imposing on domestic products by employing mechanisms 
such as ration coupons and legislations. No industry can expect 
growth if its products are sold at artificially set prices. No 
industrial producer will ever enter the arena willingly under 
such circumstances. The reform in the price system was another 
major problem of ours, the bulk of which has been resolved, 
while the what remains must be dealt with step by step. 
  Those moribund snakes who have left this winter behind, have 
started to raise certain issues and ignore all the services 
offered by the government. Although they are aware that these 
issues are really points of strength, they still raise them 
hoping they may be able to weaken the people's morale. However, 
they are once again mistaken, as these people are very 
discerning. 
  When I made the trip to Mazanderan just recently -- you saw 
a few small corners of what I saw there -- the people showed 
their mettle. The people are always waiting for an opportunity 
to express their feelings, what they understand. The people 
naturally carried out the maneuvers of being truly present in 
the arena. They made me understand that all those ill-omened 
and disheartening themes that are being fanned from some podiums 
domestically and by some foreign media cannot discourage them. 
They are far advanced in understanding the issues. They 
understand better than those who imagine themselves to 
understand and talk big. [passage omitted] 
  It was the same in countries abroad; the same in our 
neighboring countries. We have had visits abroad and you 
yourselves have seen their example. The eyes of the Muslims 
outside also are on us. Fortunately the signs of Iran's 
construction are there as well. Mr. Niyazov who was our guest 
during these last few days said that the officials of heads of 
the CIS who were in Ashgabat three or four days ago reported to 
their heads that the Turkmen markets are full of goods, contrary 
to the other CIS states. Then the CIS heads asked where those 
goods came from and were told from our Iranian brethren. The 
Iranian merchants are filling this place in that way. That means 
that your neighbor is feeling the signs of construction here 
because of its commercial link with you. Then all the CIS heads 
encouraged that link, instead of being concerned. 
  That is the Iranian that you say seeks to export terrorism. 
  That is the movement that exists. Let us not be ungrateful 
for that bounty of God. I am not claiming that we do not have 
any difficulties either. We certainly have difficulties. 
Sometimes something is expensive, something may be hard to 
find, some might bully. Well, such incidents in a state that 
seeks to reconstruct, which seeks to invest in its 
infrastructure, seeks to struggle and lock horns with the most 
satanic power in the world, seeks to confront international 
embargoes -- well, it will have such problems as well. It is 
not right that a country that annually is spending hundreds of 
thousands of millions of tumans [10 rials] on the deprived 
through subsidies, through services to deprived area, through 
relief committees, through other organizations that have a 
relief aspect for the people, and many other ways. Essentially 
the revolution is for the deprived and essentially it is the 
deprived who are our friends and army in the revolution arena. 
Then we should constantly say from our podiums and by our pens 
that the deprived are being crushed. Sometimes one sees some 
individuals who say that the bones of the vulnerable stratum are 
being broken. They misspell bone, yet they can chant slogans 
very well. 
  Let us not approach the people's morale in this way. The 
services that we are giving to those same people are not in my 
hands or the hands of those like me. It is the masses of the 
people, our community, our Hezbollahi managers, our oppressed 
revolutionary personalities who are advancing their country 
toward God as well as toward welfare in the face of the wave 
upon wave of prevalent mischief. They must be supported. Our 
enemies must not be allowed to open up unsound windows and enter 
with poisonous propaganda. We should not dishearten those 
people who are in the arena, self-sacrificing and heroic; a 
people who have always routed the enemy by their heroism. That 
is the word of the leader. In his remarks he had other great 
words. He said compare your country with your neighbors and the 
other developing countries. I do not wish to name them and give 
figures about their lives. Their difficulties are not at all 
comparable to ours. Their conditions of life are not comparable 
to ours. That must be made a point -- power and morale in the 
people. 
  Of course many of our friends and media constantly publish 
figures and the services rendered. The only point I want to 
make is that anyone who is interested in the revolution today 
must avoid disheartening the people pointlessly. Of course, 
however, if there is some truth to be told, if it is not told it 
is possible for the falsehood or the wrong or the deviation to 
remain. It is right to criticize; it is right to point out 
problems; it is right to reform; and it is right to pursue 
reform and also to confront wrongdoers. All that has its own 
path, but all must be for encouraging the people, heartening the 
people and their presence in the arenas, because that is the 
very thing that is a thorn in the side of world arrogance. It 
is the very thing that is targeted by world arrogance to prevent 
the people from remaining in the arena. Thank God our people 
are so alert and so aware that in these 15 years they have come 
through the hardest trials with honor. 
  At the end of this sermon I must offer congratulations and 
condolences to the families of the martyrs whose noble bodies we 
will be escorting for burial today. One of the most painful and 
and one of the most selfless families are those who have men 
missing in action. Their position is even more difficult than 
the families of the martyr's because at least they have the 
grave of their martyr and their situation is clear. Our dear 
forces on the borders are carrying out a tremendous job through 
finding the markers that we had for them, identity tags and 
numbers, which are found in either the Iraqi or Iranian soil. 
They are gradually finding the unknown martyrs, who are 
considered, for the time being, to be missing. I thank them and 
also call on them to speed up their operations so we could know. 
For this very reason we do not know how many prisoners we have 
in Iraq. Many of those who we think are prisoners might be 
martyrs or vice versa. This is a very valuable job and I thank 
them. We also humbly thank the families of the missing, may God 
bless them greater patience. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Let's Be Realistic Toward Oil Revenues"] </F>
  [Text] Last week President Hashemi-Rafsanjani presented the 
Second 5-Year Economic, Social, and Cultural Development Plan 
along with the 1373 (1994-1995) Budget Bill to Majles (Islamic 
Consultative Assembly). 
  In view of the discussions made by the cabinet members and 
Majles representatives, the Second 5-Year Plan might not start 
from the next Iranian calendar year and might be postponed to 
1374 (1995- 1996). 
  An official announcement has not yet been released in this 
regard. 
  Thus the year 1373 will be of momentum, making the sound and 
meticulous survey of the budget and adoption of favorable 
policies decisive for the country. 
  The country's overall budget in 1373 will amount to Rls. 
[rials] 79686.7 billion, showing marked increase as compared to 
the previous year. 
  Revenues stand out prominently in next year's budget: Of the 
entire revenues of next year's budget--that is Rls. 33,592 
billion, some Rls. 22,026 billion (amounting to 65 percent) are 
earned through oil incomes. 
  Apparently, this is largely wishful thinking in view of the 
slope in the oil prices over the past year and the possibility 
of continued oil price drops. 
  By far, if the year 1373 opens up with such a speculation, 
the country's economy will face manifold bottle-necks. To put 
it better, the officials in charge of the country's economy and 
industry try to boost the oil prices in the global markets. 
  Meanwhile, these officials should have a sound and realistic 
estimation of the oil prices so as to prepare themselves for 
hard times, to pocket more revenues through non-oil exports, and 
to base the next year's budget on less dependence on oil incomes. 
  The year 1373 is a milestone since important plans such as 
the first phase of Martyr Rajai's Thermal Power Plant, Sarkhun's 
Gas Refinery, the second phase of Arak's Petrochemical Plant, 
the Petrochemical Plant of Imam Khomeyni's Port, and ... will 
come to fruition. As such, the incomes, expenditures, economic 
policies should be more realistic. 
  Hopefully, the Majles representatives and the cabinet 
members 
will approve of the 1373 budget bill after thoroughly and 
precisely discussing and surveying it, so that next year will 
see the materialization of the country's economic, social, and 
cultural objectives.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Alternative to Oil"] </F>
  [Text] Oil prices have fallen by about 30 percent over the 
past 12 months or so. And all those oil producing countries, 
both within and without OPEC, that rely primarily on oil for 
income are suffering and will continue to do so if they do not 
devise real alternatives to oil as a source of their livelihood. 
  Iran is no exception to the above rule and it is suffering 
just as hard both externally (debt and its servicing) and 
domestically (spiralling inflation and uncertain economic 
future). But there might be a difference between Iran and the 
majority of other oil producing countries. The Islamic 
Revolution and its republic have advocated efforts towards 
reducing dependence on oil, and finding alternative to it, from 
the moment of victory as the centerpiece of its economic policy. 
The most important alternative, and one which the government 
promoted whole-heartedly, has been to strengthen foreign trade 
and enter international markets. 
  But the government campaign to cut reliance on oil has 
remained just that, and in practice no tangible results in this 
connection have been make. The reason for this failure is that 
the oil income has been too readily available. In the foreign 
trade, or export promotion arena, there have been some advances 
but the income has been too small and the gains too partial to 
be of any effect. 
  The reason for the government's partial success in the 
foreign trade has been due to the absence of a long-run, 
well-researched and integrated trade policy. And there will be 
no real success unless the government relinquishes its 
short-run, inconsistent, and sometimes contradictory, policies. 
  Oil prices have fallen and there are indications from the 
international economy, and its lingering recession, that this 
trend is not temporary, and that the low oil prices will not 
rise in the foreseeable future. And this is where the 
governments of oil producing countries, and especially Iran, 
come in to make the necessary adjustments and perhaps make the 
best of a bad situation. The Islamic Republic seems to be 
finally ready to institute the painful and real changes and 
compensate for the lost income. 
  How can the government do that? -- compensate for the lost 
income. The immediate and the one that applies to all 
situations is to cut fat, or unnecessary expenses, reduce the 
size of government, or at least stop its growth, transfer over 
to the private sector those tasks or responsibilities it is 
unable to do effectively, institute administrative reforms to 
improve efficiency, and use the available resources more 
effectively, among others. 
  As in often the case when governments lose some projected 
sources of income, the immediate alternative is to hike taxes, 
and raise the price of products and services they provide. It 
was disclosed by the head of Majles plan and budget commission 
that the government's proposed budget bill, presented to the 
Majles last week, is providing for a tax hike amounting to some 
100 billion rials. 
  For the Islamic Government the income from tax hike is a 
real 
alternative just as the incomes from export promotion or tourism 
can be. But the government should approach this matter 
ingeniously by trying to widen and diversify its sources of 
income. 
  When it comes to taxes or their hikes as alternative source 
of income to oil, the government should be careful. Because it 
is a sensitive issue and the wrong approach to it can backfire. 
The existing tax collection system has often come under fire as 
being weak and inappropriate. The country's present tax 
apparatus is in need of a change to make it responsive to the 
needs of a changing society. 
  Formerly the widely practiced and internationally accepted 
tax paying culture had no acceptance basis, and the Iranian 
people used to pay taxes reluctantly. That has changed, and 
people pay taxes willingly as a part of their social 
responsibility. But what people ask of the Islamic government 
is to collect taxes equitably and justly. There are a lot of 
people who believe the government does not need to raise taxes 
or move people to higher tax brackets. What it should and can 
do is improve tax collection system. The higher income as a 
result of improved collection system might be beyond 
government's belief. Otherwise arbitrary tax hikes lead to 
inflation, which can offset the government's increased income. 
  In Iran a lot of people with very high incomes do not pay 
taxes, or if they do what they pay comes nowhere close to the 
real taxes they should be paying. Also, because the supply is 
often below demand, there is no real competitive market 
condition, and the general public has no choice but to buy what 
it needs, the producers of goods and services are not often 
afraid of tax hikes because they can always pass it down to the 
consumer by raising the prices of their products or tampering 
with quality. The government should devise a plan to deal with 
these problems. Only then can it be sure that it has the 
support of the public for what it is doing.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 6, IRNA -- Membership in General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) can play a determining 
role in development and expansion of world economy, said a 
Foreign Ministry official here Wednesday [5 January]. 
  Head of the international organizations department of 
Foreign 
Ministry, Bozorgmehr Ziaran, in an interview with the English 
daily `TEHRAN TIMES' published today commented on Iran's 
decision to apply for membership in GATT. 
  "Formation of such a large multilateral trade organization 
after seven years of exhaustive discussions would strengthen the 
previous international ties between member states in such fields 
as agriculture, industry and textile," Ziaran added. 
  On membership of the Islamic Republic of Iran in GATT, he 
said "It is a matter of utmost importance for our country's 
decision-makers to consider the articles of this world agreement 
deeply and meticulously before making the proper final choice. 
Such an important decision should be made in a way that will 
minimize the risk of any damage to our national economy," the 
Foreign Ministry official stressed. 
  As for official stand on the issue, he said "Serious 
discussions have been going on for quite some time now, but the 
policy makers of the Islamic Republic have not yet announced 
their decision."

  [Text] The presidents of the Islamic Republic of Iran and 
the Republic of Turkmenistan today signed 11 agreements in the 
fields of economics, politics, trade, and culture at the end of 
the visit to Tehran by the Turkmen president. 
  President Saparmurad Niyazov, who visited our country at the 
head of a high-ranking delegation, left Tehran at noon today 
after signing these agreements. He was seen off officially by 
President Hashemi-Rafsanjani. 
  Our correspondent reports: With the signing of 11 
cooperation agreements by the presidents of Iran and 
Turkmenistan, economic, political, trade, and cultural 
cooperation between the two countries have increased. 
  On the basis of the agreements signed today by the two 
countries' presidents at the end of Mr. Niyazov's official visit 
to our country, Iran and Turkmenistan will cooperate on 
transport, communications, gas and oil, electricity, railways, 
trade, banking relations, education, and training. 
  Turkmen President Niyazov today expressed satisfaction at 
the 
outcome of his five-day official visit to our country. He said: 
  [Begin Niyazov recording, speaking in Turkmen, fading into 
Persian translation] This trip has had a profound and very 
positive effect on us, and on behalf of the people and 
government of Turkmenistan, we sincerely thank Mr. 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani for laying the foundation for strong 
relations between the two countries. [end recording] 
  Mr. Niyazov said that close and growing cooperation between 
the two countries are exemplary, and that some important 
agreements have been signed which will be beneficial to the 
people of the two countries and will also have their deserved 
impact on regional and international political cooperation. 
  The Turkmen president thanked the people and officials of 
the 
Islamic Republic of Iran for their warm hospitality. 
  Speaking about the outcome of his talks with the Turkmen 
president, Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani, our country's president, 
said: 
  [Begin Hashemi-Rafsanjani recording] In the name of God, the 
merciful, the compassionate. The visit by His Excellency Mr. 
Niyazov and his delegation was an interesting one. As far as 
official visits are concerned, it could even be considered as 
rather unique, because almost all the members of Turkmenistan's 
cabinet, together with governors general, vice presidents, 
deputy ministers, Friday prayer leaders, and other key Turkmen 
figures accompanied the Turkmen president. 
  This was quite a revealing thing, in that it showed how 
serious both sides were to work together in all fields. He 
himself explained that he left only the speaker of parliament 
and the chief of the police behind, and brought everyone else to 
Iran to make expansion of cooperation possible. This also 
proves what a stable and secure place Turkmenistan is if its 
entire officialdom can stay out of the country for five days. 
This is yet another interesting point, and this tranquillity 
and stability provides the people of Turkmenistan with the 
opportunity to develop their newly-independent country. They 
should appreciate their stability, especially in view of what is 
now happening in other countries with a background similar to 
Turkmenistan. 
  The length of the visit was also noteworthy. They were here 
for five days, during which they visited many places and held 
talks on a multitude of subjects. Fortunately, today we witness 
the commissioning of 480 telephone lines between our two 
countries. Through these lines, Turkmenistan will be connected 
to the whole world via Iran. This is just one aspect of the 
revival of the ancient Silk Road, albeit in a modern context. 
  We signed many agreements when we visited there, and our 
work 
there was carried over to this trip and was completed in the 
talks between the officials. Agreements have been signed in all 
fields. 
  Good as the progress in cooperation has been in these past 
two to three years, I think that after this trip the pace of 
cooperation will be even faster. I think the other countries in 
the region can also benefit from our cooperation. No country 
should think that our cooperation with Turkmenistan is at odds 
with their interests; on the contrary, I believe this will pave 
the way for others to join in. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" Interview with Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar </F>
Velayati by unidentified correspondent; place and date not 
given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Mr. Foreign Minister, what were the 
main issues discussed between the visiting Turkmen delegation 
and the Iranian officials. 
  [Velayati] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. His Excellency President Saparmurad Niyazov has 
come here on the basis of the invitation of our president, and 
he has reciprocated the recent visit of our president to 
Turkmenistan. He and his entourage stayed here for five days. 
During their stay here they have made very good discussions 
with their Iranian counterparts in different ministries and in 
different committees. At the end of his trip we had signed 
eleven documents. Three of these documents were signed by [the] 
two presidents. I think after the signing of these documents 
many facilities have been provided for the expansioning of 
relations between our two countries. 
  [Correspondent] As you know, Afghanistan is now facing a 
very critical situation. What are the measures and stances 
taken by Iran towards the on-going Afghan crisis? 
  [Velayati] This is [a] very unfortunate situation. You know 
the people of Afghanistan since the very beginning after the 
occupation of that country by the former Soviet forces, they 
have tried a lot to expel the former Soviet forces and they have 
succeeded. So the first part of their struggle was very 
successful. But, unfortunately, after the victory of the Islamic 
revolution in Afghanistan they have started fighting against 
each other. We as the Islamic Republic of Iran are against any 
kind of internal conflict. We don't support any party against 
another party. What we have done till now is bringing all 
factions together and trying to make a peaceful settlement among 
all these factions which are fighting against each other. We 
deeply believe that any kind of internal conflict is against the 
interest of the people of Afghanistan. 
  [Reporter] Iran has decided to resume diplomatic relations 
with South Africa. On what basis has this decision been made 
and how long the normalization of ties will continue? 
  [Velayati] You know this decision was made last night in the 
Cabinet meeting, and we have been instructed by the government 
to prepare the ground for resumption of relations with South 
Africa. After the recent important developments we could witness 
in South Africa and on the basis of the request of the head of 
important groups there, ANC [African National Congress] and EAC 
[Ease African Community], and specifically Mr. Mandela has asked 
us to resume our relations, and Muslim groups in South Africa 
also have asked us. So we think that as a first step we have to 
resume our economic relations with South Africa, and after the 
elections, which will be held in, before the end of April, after 
the end of that elections we think that the time will be right 
for the resumption of the political relations. 
  [Reporter] Thank you very much, sir. 
  [Velayati] You are welcome.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mohammad Ebrahim Taherian, head of the </F>
Foreign Ministry's second bureau in charge of West Asian 
affairs, by unidentified announcer; place and date not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Announcer] Mr. Mohammad Ebrahim Taherian, about 
two years have passed since the victory of the Afghan mojahedin. 
During that period, we have witnessed relative, sporadic, and 
intermittent clashes among the Afghan struggling groups in that 
country, despite the general belief that after victory they 
would reach a relative understanding and begin rebuilding the 
country. But we have actually witnessed that they have failed to 
reach a comprehensive agreement. What are the reasons for the 
clashes? 
  [Taherian] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. As you pointed out, during the past two years, and 
after the mojahedin entered Kabul, they have had various 
agreements among themselves that have never been completely put 
into practice. Perhaps one of the reasons is that none of those 
agreements has ever taken into consideration the rights of all 
the groups in a comprehensive and complete manner and has not 
paid complete attention to all the realities existing in 
Afghanistan. At times interference by those who did not know 
about the Afghan issue and were outside the region has resulted 
in a failure for any serious work to be done. It must be said, 
unfortunately, that the monopolistic tendencies of some 
individuals have become an added burden and resulted in our 
witnessing repeated clashes in the Afghan capital, Kabul, and 
intermittent fighting in various areas in Afghanistan in the 
past two years, an Afghanistan that has been beset by war, 
bloodshed, and destruction for 14 years. And that has continued 
because of what I told you. 
  [Announcer] You made a passing reference to the role of 
foreign factors in this. What do you believe its extent to be? 
  [Taherian] What is definite is that the forces outside the 
region and those elements who are not present in the region have 
had some connections with some of the groups. And those 
connections have always resulted in -- without taking into 
consideration the interests of the Muslim people of Afghanistan 
and what the people of Afghanistan need -- them seeking their 
own specific goals. That definitely is one of the factors that 
has resulted in continued clashes or at times has started 
clashes. 
  In the past two years we have seen clashes that one can 
specifically connect to foreign elements, to the affiliation 
that some groups have with foreign elements. The result of all 
that has always been one loser -- the suffering Muslim people of 
Afghanistan. 
  [Announcer] Mr. Taherian, achieving a relative understanding 
is an important parameter in the Afghan events. Everyone, 
particularly us in the Islamic Republic wish for the Afghan 
groups to solve their problems in peace and to reach an 
understanding. But what do you propose as a particular 
political solution to the Afghan problem? 
  [Taherian] As you have pointed out, the Islamic Republic of 
Iran stood by the holy war of the Afghan Muslim people against 
the Soviet occupiers. After victory and mojahedin's entrance to 
Kabul, the Islamic Republic of Iran continued to stand by them 
and has always wished for the improvement of the Afghan 
situation and has given practical help to the Muslim people. It 
has done so during the jehad as well as the mojahedin victory 
and will continue to do so. We are certain that for regional 
stability, the Afghan problem should be solved through 
negotiations between the jehad groups. 
  In answering your first question, I pointed out that the 
problems existing between the conflicting groups have their 
roots in the past two years and possibly even in the pre-victory 
period. The important principle that must be taken into account 
by all those interested in finding a solution is the reality of 
the situation -- Afghanistan is a Muslim and a multinational 
country. Any solution must take these two factors into account. 
Furthermore, all the groups have a large amount of weapons. 
The [Soviet] occupiers can not claim that they developed the 
country. While Afghanistan was occupied, they provided weapons 
for various groups more than anything else, and Afghanistan has 
been turned into an ammunition dump. 
  These several factors must be taken into account for any 
solution that might be put forward. And the Afghan groups must 
also consider that any solution that is going to be planned and 
programmed, if it is going to be turned into law, must recognize 
the rights of all nationalities, groups, and parties. They must 
be given their portion of rights. We would be wrong to think 
that a group, on its own, could achieve supremacy. 
Unfortunately all groups have experienced this one way or 
another. If they go alone on a path, they would achieve 
nothing. It seems that the most reasonable way is first for the 
mojahedin and people of Afghanistan to find a solution based on 
Islamic principles and according to the ethnic conditions of the 
country. And second, Afghanistan's neighbors could prepare the 
grounds for such discussions and the necessary dialogue that 
must take place between the various groups, so as to allow 
Afghan groups to sit together around a table and find a 
reasonable solution based on Islamic principles acceptable by 
nearly all the people. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Enough Is Enough"] </F>
  [Text] Disgusting and appalling news are emerging again 
from Afghanistan which once used to be called a symbol of 
sacrifice for the sake of independence and self-respect. The 
same Afghanistan produced an ugly image in the international 
opinion after the culmination of their struggle in 1991 when the 
Soviet Union-installed government ceased to exist. 
  The Mojahedin, who had been ready to sacrifice all they had 
in the way of the armed struggle against the Communist 
occupiers, turned their guns against each other. So far more 
civilians and military personnel have become victims of their 
revenge than all the casualties recorded during the 15 years of 
Soviet occupation. 
  Western countries led by the United States ran away from 
Afghanistan as after the conclusion of the Cold War and the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union their interest in the 
land-locked country ended. 
  But regional countries, particularly Iran and Pakistan, have 
done their best to solve the internal fight, and have met with 
no success. 
  Former Pakistani prime minister, Nawaz Sharif took all the 
warring parties to Islam's holiest place, in Mecca, where the 
Mojahedin vowed not to fight with each other and work for the 
reconstruction of their almost destroyed country during 15 years 
of war with the Reds. 
  Their pledge before the Almighty in Whose name they fought 
the Communists had no meaning and several times they have shed 
the blood of their own brothers. 
  The last was on Saturday when hundreds of rockets slammed 
into Kabul, the worst onslaught on the shattered capital in 
months. 
  The forces of President Borhanoddin Rabbani and Prime 
Minister Hekmatyar battled in other parts of the country also. 
  It looks like the Mojahedin signed a peace agreement for 
nothing but to break the citizens and bring them more hardship. 
So far, whatever the neighboring countries have done to bring 
peace to Afghanistan is not enough and a concrete step should be 
taken. 
  An immediate summit meeting of regional countries including 
Iran, Pakistan and some others with influence in Afghanistan, 
could be held to chalk out a plan for free and fair elections 
which is a must and that many believe can silence the guns.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Although after a few days of clashes among various 
rival groups in Kabul the intensity of fighting has to some 
extent subsided, nevertheless, it is difficult to have a clear 
view about future developments in that country. Different news 
media have dispatched various reports that indicate new 
developments in Afghanistan. On the basis of these reports, the 
opponents of Borhanoddin Rabbani have made his removal from 
power a pre-condition for ending the fighting in Kabul. 
Analysts predict that in this way the situation in Afghanistan 
is in the throes of unpredictable events. The question being 
asked by analysts is whether such a demand will be. 
  In any case, even if power passes hands in Kabul, one cannot 
expect fundamental changes to occur in the course of events in 
that country. The only difference would be that the tragic 
fight for power in Afghanistan would be repeated in a different 
form, because none of the groups wish to reach a total and 
comprehensive agreement. On the contrary, each group looks into 
the future of Afghanistan only through the prism of its own 
interests. One can find the evidence for this in many 
agreements that have been signed during the past two years, 
especially the Islamabad and Jalalabad agreements. 
  There is very little flexibility in the positions adopted by 
various groups. The whole country is awash with weapons and 
armed forces. The forces under the commands of various leaders 
do not obey them in practice. The leaders themselves distrust 
one another, and each agreement is invalid in the eyes of 
others. The combination of these factors prevents one from 
making a positive assessment about the developments in 
Afghanistan. 
  The truth is that what the people of Afghanistan need at 
present above all else is security. Any development that will 
not bring about secruity for the people of Afghanistan is to be 
rejected. The two-year war among various rival political and 
military groups has destroyed the resources and capabilities of 
Afghanistan, has denied security to the people, has caused death 
and injury of thousands of people, and has turned many more 
thousands into refugees. Even now one cannot look forward to a 
bright future for that country. 
  Political analysts believe the problem of Afghanistan does 
not consist in what group holds power in that country. The 
problem is that whatever group comes to power in Kabul, other 
groups raise the banner of opposition to it. It seems that the 
only solution to this problem is for all the rival groups to 
sincerely lay down their arms and to sit round a negotiation 
table with the aim of achieving the interests of their country 
and to disarm the irresponsible military forces. Then, each 
group should accept some responsibility in proportion to its 
ability and aptitude. In this context, each group should give 
priority to the national interests of Afghanistan above its own 
group interests. Otherwise, war will continue until all groups 
are worn out. Under such circumstances, the people of 
Afghanistan will be the main losers, and foreigners would impose 
their conditions on them from ouside.

  [Excerpt] Following the opening of Brunei's embassy in 
Tehran, (Haj Suhini Bin Haj Muhammad Hassan), that country's 
first charge d'affaires in the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
yesterday met with the Iranian foreign minister, Mr. Velayati 
and presented his credentials. 
  In the meeting, the two officials discussed the expansion 
and 
the strengthening of the two countries' relations, and the 
coming visit of the sultan of Brunei, Haj Hassan Bolkiah, to 
Iran. 
  The Bruneian charge d'affaires considered the Islamic 
Republic of Iran as a second home, and stressed the willingness 
of his country's officials in strengthening relations with the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  Pointing to the results of their previous meetings and 
discussions of the two countries' officials, and the positive 
steps which have been taken in line with the two countries' 
ties, Mr. Velayati considered the Bruneian ruler's coming visit 
to Iran as a significant step for expansion of relations.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mohammad Javad Larijani: "Legal Behavior"] </F>
  [Text] 1. At the initiative of U.S. Senator Kennedy and 
with the extensive cooperation of the propaganda machinery, the 
anniversary of the Pan American explosion over Lockerbie, 
England [as published], was marked by a pompous ceremony, the 
major objective of which was to justify the pressure by the 
United States and the West on Libya or, in a broader sense, to 
show the so-called fight against state terrorism. During this 
propaganda show, there were also some who tried to criticize 
Iran--probably because of the West's anger over the visit by the 
foreign minister of the Islamic Republic of Iran to Tripoli. 
  2. A live television program with a large number of viewers 
aired questions and answers on the incident and the legality of 
the United States' demands that the Libyans accused of the 
incident be handed over. 
  One listener asked: "If it is true that the United States 
has the right to demand that a person it thinks is responsible 
for the explosion be handed over to it, then the Iranian 
Government can also demand that those responsible for the 
downing of a civilian Airbus by a missile in the Persian Gulf, 
which resulted in the deaths of its passengers, be handed over 
to Iran to be tried and sentenced in Iran." 
  The person to whom the question was asked, who was 
apparently 
caught off guard, hastily said: "No, no. These are two 
completely different issues." 
  The correspondent, who found the entire scene disgraceful, 
said sarcastically: "Yes. There is a great difference. An 
Iranian mother apparently doesn't love her children as much as 
an American mother does!" 
  Inevitably, a philosopher who was with the person being 
interviewed, commented: 
  "Well, the U.S. Government's actions are all based on law 
and 
we have always behaved in a legal manner in the world. 
Therefore our situation is very different from the situation of 
others." 
  3. The above is not the only example of the emptiness of the 
West's political-humanitarian thoughts in justifying its 
behavior. Those who consider the perpetration of any crime to be 
permissible on the pretext of fighting fundamentalism or for the 
sake of human rights display the ugliest examples of behavior in 
history. Every day, the people of the world see dozens of 
examples of this kind of "logic" and "law." But why are they 
facing a problem? Why are modern technology, supreme economic 
power, and spectacular military might unable to offer a logical 
justification? Undoubtedly all their problems have to do with 
"being righteous." Bad can be disguised as good for some time, 
but the truth will ultimately surface. Even though we, the 
Islamic ummah, do not have supreme military might or advanced 
technological capabilities, we can safeguard our grandeur and 
our respect if we support justness and right.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Majid Reza'iyan: "Why This Indifference?"] </F>
  [Text] Public opinion is often described as an obscure 
political power and is considered to be one of the major pillars 
of national strength. In the area of public opinion the press 
plays an important role and, generally speaking, its efforts are 
summed up as either "positive" or "negative." 
  The press in Iran today is facing extremely sensitive 
conditions that inevitably call for the adoption of a clear 
stance and firm guidance of public opinion. 
  Actually, why are some of our press today indifferent toward 
a reality that is known as cultural onslaught? What impact does 
this indifference have on the current generation and will it 
have on the coming generation? 
  The esteemed leader, His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, who 
has repeatedly stressed the dangers of a foreign cultural 
onslaught and has warned against weakness toward this onslaught, 
said when appointing the new KEYHAN editor that "indifference 
toward the Iranian nation's mental needs and its Islamic and 
revolutionary aspirations, which can be seen in some of the 
country's press today, is a sin that will not be pardoned by our 
people now or in the future or on the day of divine judgment." 
  Yes! Some of the newspapers in Iran today consider the 
publication of the ideas of those who do not believe in the 
Islamic and national grandeur of the people to be better than 
confronting such ideas. Some newspapers prefer to propagate 
secular beliefs within the framework of each interview and 
roundtable discussion that they publish rather than propound the 
luminous ideas of Islam and of the revolution. 
  Where should we seek the root of such indifference? Where 
does this indifference, conservatism, and disregard for reality 
and values come from? 
  It seems that some of the foreign cultural onslaught happens 
not because it is strong but because our own forces are not firm 
in stating their views. 
  What answer do those who manage most of the press, 
especially 
the newspapers, in Iran today and should meet the mental needs 
of the Iranian nation, the young generation, and the truth 
seekers have for this indifference? 
  How successful have some newspapers with a high circulation 
that publish long interviews and propound the "theory of 
forbearance" or publish items trying to encourage the country's 
foreign policy to establish relations with the United States 
been in their main mission, which is to guide public opinion, 
clarify reality, and defend the country from the foreign 
onslaught? Especially at a time when the ideological and 
cultural trends of heterodox elements are exploiting the freedom 
of the press in Iran today and are constantly putting forth 
pro-Western theories. Of course, it is because of the 
prevailing indifference that such situations are not confronted. 
The esteemed leader said in his statement appointing the new 
KEYHAN editor: 
  "The confrontation and rebellion against aspirations that 
can 
unfortunately be seen in some newspapers today because of the 
exploitation of the freedoms that the Islamic Republic enjoys is 
a heavy and unforgettable sin." 
  Thus, with the clear stances by the leader of the 
revolution, 
there is no place for pretexts. The forces that consider 
themselves pious and committed to the revolution and to its 
values and who rely on how some of the newspapers guide public 
opinion do not have any justification for the continuation of 
this indifference.

  [Text] The LTTE [Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam] has 
confirmed that its former deputy leader Gopalaswamy 
Mahendraraja, alias Mahattaya, has been sentenced to death. 
According to early intelligence reports, his execution has been 
tentatively fixed for the 16th of this month. A news dispatch 
received by LANKAPUVATH from London states that this week's 
edition of the official LTTE news bulletin (KHALLATATHIL) 
published in London announced that Mahattaya has been sentenced 
to death. He is also a former leader of the political wing of 
the terrorist group. Mahattaya is reported to be held in an 
LTTE prison in Jaffna. 
  The main accusation against him is that he has served as an 
agent of India's Research and Analysis Wing and allegedly 
provided vital information which led to the Indian Navy 
apprehending the MV Ahatta on board [as heard] which LTTE's 
international representative and former deputy leader Sadasivam 
Krishnakumar, alias Kittu, was transporting a shipload of highly 
sophisticated weapons for use by the LTTE.

  [Text] Colombo, Jan 5 (AFP) - Suspected Tamil rebels killed 
a prospective candidate ahead of elections to local government 
bodies in Sri Lanka's embattled northeast, and warned others 
against participating, officials said Wednesday. 
  Gunmen believed to be from the separatist Liberation Tigers 
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) dragged out Kanagaratnam Jeevaratnam from 
his home in eastern Sittandy late Tuesday, shot him dead and 
dumped his body in the town, officials said. 
  "There was also a note by the side (of the body) warning 
that 
others who try to contest will also get the same treatment," a 
local official in the east said, adding it was "definitely" the 
work of the LTTE. 
  Jeevaratnam was planning to stand as an independent 
candidate 
in the local government elections due to be held shortly. 
However, exact dates of balloting have not yet been announced. 
  Nominations for the local government polls were being 
received from Wednesday in the eastern districts of Trincomalee, 
Batticaloa and Ampara and northern Vavuniya. Nominations close 
on January 12. 
  The LTTE has called on Tamil parties to boycott the polls 
and 
had put up posters in the east, threatening those who 
participated in the polls with death. 
  Since the parliamentary elections of February 1989, there 
has 
been no balloting in the northeast due to the ongoing war 
between government troops and LTTE guerrillas. 
  The LTTE is fighting for a separate state in the northeast 
for Sri Lanka's two million minority Tamils who are concentrated 
in the region. Thousands have died in the LTTE-led independence 
campaign.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Turmoil in Afghanistan"] </F>
  [Text] It is extremely painful that the internecine 
fighting in Afghanistan has assumed the form of a war causing 
widespread damage to property and loss of lives. In the 
struggle for power between different groups, hundreds of 
civilians have been uprooted from their homes and are fleeing in 
panic to safe places. In the latest round of fighting which 
broke out on the New Year's Day for control of the Afghan 
capital Kabul, dozens of people have been killed and more than 
1,700 injured. Those involved in the affray are troops loyal to 
Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and his newfound ally. Gen. 
Dostam who are pitted against those loyal to the government of 
President Burhanuddin Rabbani. The latter has reportedly fled 
the capital. 
  Since infantry battles are raging not only around Kabul but 
also in the northern province of Balkh, rockets and shells are 
raining down on the Afghan capital at the rate of six or seven a 
minute, and military aircraft are carrying out bombing raids on 
different locations, the destruction the country is facing can 
well be imagined. At the same time, the death toll is likely to 
reach alarming figures. Food and medicines are already in short 
supply in the country and if the fighting prolongs, the Afghan 
people would suffer tremendously. Although a large number of 
those who had fled their homes during Soviet occupation have 
returned to Afghanistan, the present fighting there may again 
cause outflows to Pakistan and India and other neighbouring 
countries. It is unfortunate that neither the world community 
nor the organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) has taken any 
serious notice of the civil war in Afghanistan and done nothing 
to bring it to a halt. It is only Pakistan which has expressed 
its grave concern at the situation, made an appeal to Afghan 
leaders to stop fighting and renewed its earlier offer to 
mediate a settlement between the rival factions. It has warned 
that military success by one faction over the other would be of 
a transient nature and may enlarge the fighting undermining 
national unity. The only happy news from Afghanistan is that the 
warring factions have agreed to a truce in response to an 
Iranian offer to evacuate some of the wounded from Kabul. The 
Afghan leaders must realise that the use of force is not a 
viable option to resolve political differences and disputes. 
Having taken the initiative, Foreign Minister Sardar Aseff 
Ahmed Ali should visit Afghanistan as soon as possible and make 
every effort to bring about cessation of hostilities in that 
country and help the rival factions to settle their differences 
through peaceful means.

  [Text] Islamabad, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Official 
Pakistani sources yesterday confirmed that hundreds of "Afghan" 
Arabs living in Afghanistan [as published] are now targets for 
detention and deportation to their countries of origin within 
the next few weeks. A foreign ministry spokesman in Islamabad 
has stated that Algeria, Egypt, and Tunisia had officially 
requested that Pakistan expel their extremist nationals residing 
in Pakistan. 
  The spokesman added that "solving this problem is also 
important for Pakistan." 
  Pakistan is expected to begin its campaign in the next few 
weeks to avoid the possibility of its name being added to the 
U.S. list of "states which sponsor terrorism." It is known that 
the U.S. State Department is now reviewing that list prior to 
issuing a new list in February.

  [Text] The foreign minister, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, left 
Islamabad this morning for an official visit to Central Asian 
states. The week-long tour will take him to Uzbekistan, 
Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan. Talking to newsmen before his 
departure, he said Pakistan would offer Central Asian republics 
to open up their embassies in Islamabad to help boost bilateral 
cooperation. Pakistan has already concluded about 38 agreements 
with these states for strengthening cooperation in a number of 
fields. He said no progress could be made on the agreements due 
to lack of follow up, and during his current visit he would try 
to remove blockages and revitalize them. Special attention 
would be paid to matters relating to trade, transport, and 
communications. He said Pakistan and China have agreed to sign 
an agreement to make Karakoram Highway a viable road and there 
is a plan to open it up for Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan in future.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. and Pak-India Talks"] </F>
  [Text] While the perception in Pakistan on the prospects 
of an early resumption of dialogue with India is not one of 
optimism, the U.S. State Department seems upbeat. Apparently it 
has access to some information which is not available to 
Pakistan. So far as Pakistan is concerned, it has just the 
latest pronouncements of the Indian Foreign Secretary, Dixit and 
the Indian Defence Minister [title as published] Chavan, before 
it. Mr Dixit, in reply to a question said that the UN 
Resolutions on Kashmir are irrelevant. Mr Chavan has said that 
Kashmir can neither be given independence or allowed to join 
Pakistan. Although the words used by the two are different, they 
both refer to the redundance of the UN Resolutions. The U.S., 
however, has reiterated that these Resolutions remain valid. 
That may or may not amount to a positive factor, but Pakistan's 
Foreign Secretary himself has said that India had conceded 
Kashmir's disputed status and the right of the people of Kashmir 
to have a say in the future of their land. The question then is 
that if the people of Kashmir have a say in the future of their 
land. The question then is that if the people of Kashmir have a 
say, then how can they express it? According to Mr Chavan they 
cannot ask for freedom nor can they favour Pakistan, they can 
only be allowed to say that they want to be with India. How will 
they say it, assuming that they will be allowed to do so, is not 
clear. Curious as the logic of the Indian position is, the 
explanations given for it are even more ludicrous. Mr Dixit is 
quoted as saying that how can a small number of freedom-fighters 
(dubbed secessionists) be allowed to determine the fate of the 
whole of Kashmir, and why should Pakistan risk the peace of the 
sub-continent for a small piece of land? The assumption behind 
the assessment of the number of freedom-fighters is that had 
they not come on the scene, the people of Kashmir would have 
liked to be with India. It is easy to test that assumption. When 
Cambodia went to polls under UN supervision, people did not vote 
for the Khmer Rouge. Therefore bring the UN in and let the world 
see for itself what the Kashmiris want: India or Pakistan. That 
would be the end of the problem once and for all. So far as the 
importance of that small piece of territory to Pakistan is 
concerned, it is based on the founding principle of Pakistan's 
creation. Pakistan's economy and security also depend on it. It 
is a Muslim majority state, all Pakistan's rivers flow from it 
and it is vital to Pakistan's defence. None of these factors 
apply so far as India's claim is concerned. Also, if it is small 
and insignificant, why does India want to hang on to it? 
  It was because of U.S. pressure that Pakistan withdrew its 
resolution on human rights from the UN agenda, letting India off 
the hook. Now that is clear that India has no intention of 
giving the people of Kashmir the opportunity to decide its 
future, it is the responsibility of the U.S. to make India see 
the light. And if it refuses then use its considerable economic 
and other clout against it in the interest of peace in the 
sub-continent.

  [Text] The Senate today resumed discussion on the 
president's address to the joint session of the Parliament. Mr. 
Abdur Rahim Mandokhel, who was the first speaker today, proposed 
reforms in the Constitution to give it true federal, 
parliamentary, and democratic orientation. He said the affairs 
of the government should be conducted through mutual 
accommodation and understanding between the government and the 
opposition on the one hand, and the center and the provinces on 
the other. The debate is still continuing. 
  Responding to a point of order, the minister for law and 
parliamentary affairs, Syed Iqbal Haider, reiterated the 
government's determination not to indulge in any sort of 
victimization of its political opponents. The point of order 
was raised by Ejazul Islam Jatoi in the Senate this morning, who 
complained that political opponents were being victimized in 
Sindh. Syed Iqbal Haider, however, made it clear that the law 
will take its own course against criminals, terrorists, and 
plunderers of the people's money.

  [Text] Peshawar, Dec 5 -- The Sessions Judge, Peshawar, 
Khan Akbar Khan, on Wednesday granted bail to Mir Murtaza 
Bhutto, son of former Prime Minister the late Mr Z.A. Bhutto, in 
two different cases of terrorist activities. 
  The accused is currently detailed in Karachi. 
  He had been sentenced by a military court in 1985 for his 
alleged involvement in terrorist activities. Two FIRs [First 
Information Reports] had been registered against him at police 
stations east Cantt [Cantonment] and Faqirabad. 
  The Judge directed the public prosecutor to submit to the 
court complete record of the cases. In his judgement, the judge 
wrote that the original judicial file was not received though 
the same was requisitioned in connection with the present 
petition and the court was told that the same had been destroyed 
and not received back from the martial law authorities whereas 
only the police file consisting mostly of carbon and photostat 
copies of various documents were submitted. 
  The Judge wrote that a careful perusal of the record 
submitted to the court showed that the present petitioner (Mir 
Murtaza Bhutto) was not named in the FIRs in question nor was 
there any direct evidence against him. Though some of the 
co-accused had mentioned the name of Mir Murtaza Bhutto, 
alleging that he gave them training instructions about the 
explosions, the confessions were in the form of photostat copies 
while the originals thereof were not available. 
  The court was of the view that in this situation the alleged 
abscondance of the petitioner had no material, solid and genuine 
support. 
  The court accepted the application of the petitioner and 
ordered his release on bail in the sum of Rs. 100,000 with two 
local and reliable sureties in the like amount to the 
satisfaction of the court. 
  [Karachi DAWN in English on 6 Jan on p 18, in an additional 
report adds: "Mir Murtaza Bhutto, son of the late Zulfikar Ali 
Bhutto, went on hunger strike on Wednesday. 
  "At 71-Clifton, [Nusrat Bhutto's residence] spokesman Ahsan 
Bhazzi told newsmen that Mir Murtaza had asked his family not to 
bring food for him until the demands of 40 Hyderabad Jail 
inmates, now on hunger strike, were accepted. 
  "The spokesman recalled that Mir Murtaza Bhutto, who has 
been 
lodged to Borstal Jail, Landhi, since his arrival after 16-year 
in self-exile in Syria, had given a notice to the jail 
authorities about his hunger strike. 
  "In reply to a question, Bhatti said that as no one had been 
allowed to see Mir Murtaza Bhutto after the Larkana tragedy, he 
could not say what his reaction was."]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Harish Das: "Militants Under Pressure in </F>
Kashmir"] 
  [Text] The Kashmir militants are losing their base in 
Kashmir. The public is feeling gradually disillusioned by the 
promises of the militants who have hitherto been extorting money 
on one pretext or the other. They can no more organize public 
demonstrations at will. The people who are developing faith in 
the Indian security forces, much against Pakistan propaganda, 
are walking away from the Pakistan-trained extremists. The 
rising criminality in militant ranks and intergroup clashes are 
leading to frequent shooting, extortion, and kidnapping and 
harassment of women. The militants' guns are becoming a new 
symbol of power as well as access to easy money. Again, like in 
Punjab, the militants are resorting to recruit the youth at 
gunpoint. 
  Pakistan is also now suspicious of the Kashmir militants. 
The lack of faith in their capacity has resulted in greater 
infiltration of Afghan and other militants by ISI [Interservice 
Intelligence] to provide, what Pakistan says, leadership to 
Kashmiri militants. With most Kashmiri pundits [Brahmans] having 
fled the valley, militants, especially foreign mercenaries, have 
turned to making the local Muslims as their target whether on 
the suspicion of being police informers, settling personal 
scores, or simple criminalization. 
  More than 1,700 Kashmiri Muslims have been killed since 1990 
as against about 350 Hindus. Militants set on fire about 4,000 
private houses, over 1,300 schools and government buildings, and 
have abducted over 1,100 persons. There has been alarming 
increase in abduction and extortion as the people of Kashmir 
refuse to shelter the extremists now. More significantly, 
public response to bundh [strike] calls by militants has been on 
the decline, especially after the successful Hazratbal [shrine] 
surrender with all their arms and foreign mercenaries. 
  The cleansing operations in Sopor, Baramula, and Anantnag -- 
all erstwhile strongholds of the militants -- are now 
comparatively calm as the security forces have maintained the 
pressure on extremists and have isolated them from the general 
public. Headlong confrontation, which has been minimal, has 
been confined to hard-core Kashmir militants and foreign 
mercenaries, especially Afghans battle-hardened in the wars 
against the Russian forces. This has led to increased and 
indirect involvement of ISI of Pakistan. The Interservice 
Intelligence of Pakistan is sending highly trained Pakistani and 
Arab terrorists into Indian territory in a desperate bid to 
establish a countrywide network and support system of subversion 
and terrorism. A report of the U.S. House Republican Research 
Committee says that ISI has developed a professional 
infiltration route for their operations via Nepal because of 
pressure on other areas to chalk out plans for carrying out 
disturbances and sabotage in the Indian territory. The report 
adds that highly trained terrorists of Jamaat-i-Tulaba with the 
active support of organizations, such as the Indian Student 
Islamic Movement, are carrying their activities in Indian soil. 
The leadership has been taken away from the hands of Kashmiri 
Muslims, especially JKLF [Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front]. 
Now, there is a direct Pakistan force operating in Kashmir. 
Pakistan schemed to internationalize the issue and is leaving 
no stone unturned. 
  The Indo-Pak talks were bound to end in fruitless exercise 
as 
was clear from the statements of Pakistan political and military 
leadership. The statement of Ms. Benazir Bhutto that no talks 
can move forward unless India concedes that Kashmir has a right 
to secede only goes to show that she is quite incapable of being 
reasonable about Kashmir and remaining as a prime minister. She 
is not prepared to give the same right to Sindhis or northwest 
frontier area of Pakistan that has all along been seeking the 
right to secede. 
  The whole world knows that Bangladesh had to pay a very 
heavy 
price to the invading Pakistan forces. The failure of Pakistan 
forces to get Kashmir by proxy war has led to new offensive to 
seek international mediation. Pakistan was never sincere in 
holding any talk to improve bilateral relations, much less solve 
the Kashmir problem. It has no love for Kashmiri Muslims. It 
only wants to annex Kashmir by whatever means. The leadership 
in Pakistan knows that it cannot take Kashmir by force, hence it 
is seeking international support, especially of ICO [Islamic 
Conference Organization] countries, thinking that in the name of 
religion, Muslim world would come to Pakistan aid. It reflects 
a poor understanding of new world order by Pakistani leadership.

  [Excerpt] The prime minister has ruled out dissolution of 
Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh Assemblies and holding of early 
elections in the states. Talking to newsmen on his arrival in 
Nandial, Mr. Narasimha Rao said that Congress-I governments in 
these states have still nine months to go for elections. 
  Replying to a question, he asserted that efforts by external 
forces to destabilize the country will be foiled and India will 
not allow anybody to meddle with its internal affairs. Mr. Rao 
also said that the government is committed to deal firmly with 
terrorism, especially in Jammu and Kashmir, so that normal 
condition is returned to the state. 
  Earlier, addressing a public meeting in Atmakur in Kurnool 
District, he asserted the country will never give in to any evil 
designs. He said that peace is a prerequisite for development 
and warned that stringent action would be taken against those 
trying to disturb the law and order situation. Mr. Rao said the 
Kashmir problem will be sorted out at the earliest and it is the 
center's endeavor to establish a popular government in the 
troubled state soon. The prime minister listed the steps taken 
by the center for the welfare of women and backward classes. He 
sought people's cooperation for effective implementation of 
these programs. He also said that the recent assembly election 
results in the northern states are clear testimony of the 
people's faith in the policies and programs enunciated by the 
Congress-I government at the center. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Samuel Vaid] </F>
  [Text] Although the United States has dropped Pakistan 
from the list of those countries being watched for their support 
to transborder terrorism for it what it calls lack of evidence, 
there are countries besides India who have been suffering 
because of Islamabad's post-Zia policy to support religious 
fundamentalist militancy to subvert stable governments and 
systems in other countries. Among the victims of this policy 
have been even the Muslim countries. Afghanistan is one of 
them. Pak-supported religious fundamentalists did not allow any 
government to survive in that country. The victory of these 
fundamentalist forces there has brought about a never ending 
nightmare for the innocent Afghan population. The Afghan 
president twice protested against Pakistan's support to 
fundamentalist forces led by Hekmatyar Khan. But these protests 
have been replied with only economic aid. 
  Egypt is another country which openly accused Pakistan of 
supporting those elements who wanted to destabilize the present 
government there. During his visit to Washington early last 
year, President Husni Mubarak had told President Clinton of the 
threat his government faced from fundamentalists trained in 
terrorist activities in Pakistan. The USA at that time was 
supposed to be keeping Pakistan under watch. It is not known 
what assurance Mr. Clinton gave to Mr. Mubarak. What we know, 
that after some months Pakistan was removed from the list of 
terrorism supporting countries. We also know that after the 
prime minister of Egypt, 'Atif Sidqi, escaped an attempt on his 
life last November made by a person who keeps on visiting 
Pakistan and Afghanistan. The name of this person is Mohammad 
(Makavi) who confessed to the FRONTIER POST of Peshawar last 
month that he was behind the attack on Mr. Sidqi's life. 
(Makavi) confessed that he has been fully involved in the war 
in Afghanistan and that he is a supporter of Hekmatyar Khan and 
opponent of President Borhanoddin Rabbani. His confession is 
vital, inasmuch as it clearly reveals that religious 
fundamentalists do not keep their activities confined to their 
own countries. This is something India has started facing in 
Kashmir. 
  Like Egypt, Algeria, too, is faced with the threat to its 
stability from Pakistan-trained militants. The Algerian prime 
minister, Redha Malek, recently told newsmen that 
anti-government Algerians were getting training in Afghan-Arab 
camps in Pakistan. They were receiving money from external 
sources and that money was used for buying weapons in Western 
countries to be transported to Algeria for terrorist activities. 
Mr. Mubarak [name as heard] condemned both Pakistan and Sudan 
for their support to these elements and pleaded with Western 
countries not to allow these elements to use their soil for 
anti-Algeria activities. What some Muslim countries are facing 
at the hands of Pakistan today has been the experience of India. 
And what is happening in Kashmir is terrorism and human rights 
violation at the hands of these foreign- trained elements.

  [Text] The Malhotra Committee on reforms in the insurance 
sector submitted its report to the finance minister, Dr. 
Manmohan Singh, in New Delhi today. The committee in its report 
has called for allowing the private sector and foreign companies 
in the insurance sector. But it has suggested certain controls 
for its efficient working in the new economic conditions. The 
33-point recommendation submitted by the former governor of the 
Reserve Bank of India, Mr. R.N. Malhotra, has suggested that the 
private sector companies must have a minimum pay-back capital of 
100 crore rupees and the promoter stage should not exceed 40 
percent of the capital. The report said that if the foreign 
insurance companies were allowed, they should float Indian 
companies. The committee has recommended that LIC [Life 
Insurance Corporation] should be converted into a company 
registered under the Companies Act. 
  The report says Postal Life Insurance should be permitted to 
transact life insurance business in the rural areas among the 
general public. The committee has recommended that the 
ownership pattern of the LIC, GIC [General Insurance 
Corporation] and its four subsidiary companies should be changed 
by reducing government share holding to 50 percent. It has also 
suggested that all insurance companies should be equally 
governed by the provisions of the Insurance Act. The committee 
was set up in April last year to examine the existing structure 
of the insurance industry and to suggest changes in light of the 
new economic policy.

  [Text] India and China are to increase their cooperation 
in the field of coal mining. India is interested in sharing 
China's experience and technology in mechanized long-wall mining 
in underground mines. Greater emphasis is now being laid on 
underground mines, as over 70 percent of Indian coal is coming 
from open-cast mines at present. Underground mining is 
necessary to increase the production of superior grade coal as 
well as coking coal whose deposits are available at deeper 
levels. Specific areas of collaboration between the two 
countries are expected to be finalized during the visit of a 
high-level delegation led by the coal minister, Mr. Ajit Kumar 
Panja, to China beginning from Sunday [9 January].

  [Text] Nairobi, Jan 6 (AFP) -- Representatives of 
Khartoum's Islamic fundamentalist government were to open 
Kenyan-brokered talks with rebels from mainly Christian and 
animist southern Sudan here Friday [6 January], officials said. 
  Leaders of the two rival factions of the rebel Sudan 
People's 
Liberation Army (SPLA) told the Archbishop of Canterbury, George 
Carey, on Monday that they were committed to peace. 
  John Garang, leader of the mainstream SPLA faction, and Riek 
Machar of the breakaway SPLA United group met the archbishop 
after his controversial trip to famine-stricken rebel-held 
southern Sudan prompted a major diplomatic row between Khartoum 
and London. 
  But despite the rebels' assurances, western diplomats were 
sceptical about the outcome of the talks, hosted by Kenyan 
President Daniel arap Moi as chairman of a six-member regional 
group, the Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and 
Development. 
  Sudanese Government and rebel delegates held inconclusive 
talks in Nairobi last year after Nigerian-mediated negotiations 
failed to bring peace to famine-ravaged southern Sudan, a vast 
undeveloped region of savannah and swampland twice the size of 
France. 
  After informal consultations on Wednesday and Thursday, the 
talks were to open formally on Friday, the officials said. 
  The SPLA United faction wants a referendum on secession of 
the south from the Arabic-speaking Islamic north, while Garang's 
group would prefer to preserve Sudanese unity. 
  Relief officials here said government warplanes had made 
several bombing raids on the south in the past two weeks amid 
fears that Khartoum is poised to launch a major new offensive.

  [Text] Cairo 6 Jan (SUNA) -- Brigadier al-Tijani Khalifah, 
director of air operations at the Civil Aviation Authority, is 
currently on a visit to Cairo. Yesterday he stated that the 
Russian Antonov aircraft, which is on hire to certain quarters 
in Sudan, and whose Russian crew fled with it last week and 
landed at Luxor Airport, had been carrying foodstuffs belonging 
to the World Food Program from al-Ubayyid to Bahr al-Ghazal. In 
a news conference he held in Cairo, he said that the aircraft 
arrived in Sudan in accordance with a commercial contract with a 
Sudanese commercial aviation company, and that the Sudanese 
Government was not a party to the contract. 
  Brig. al-Tijani Khalifah denied the claims of the aircraft 
crew, published by the Egyptian press, that Sudanese authorities 
had been holding the aircraft. He said: We in Sudan did not 
imprison any crew in Sudan. He pointed out that there were six 
sets of foreign crews for air transport in the country.

  [Excerpt] Doha, 7 Jan -- Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jabir 
al-Sabah, first deputy prime minister and minister of foreign 
affairs, has revealed in press statements published here that he 
will visit Yemen, but did not mention the date of the visit. 
  In statements to the Qatari press reported by the QATARI 
NEWS 
AGENCY [QNA], Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad said that the program of his 
foreign tour included a visit to Yemen, but the current 
conditions that Yemen was experiencing did not allow this visit. 
  He added "when these conditions end and disappear I will 
visit Sanaa." 
  The first deputy prime minister and minister of foreign 
affairs expressed regrets over current events in Yemen. He also 
expressed regrets and astonishment for the rumors implicating 
Kuwait in the rift and dispute between north and south Yemen, 
saying that this is void of truth and a mere fabrication. 
  He pointed out that Kuwait is very far removed from the 
dispute that the state of Yemen is currently experiencing and 
this matter "hurts us very much." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by political </F>
correspondent Gil Litman; at the Allenby Bridge on 6 
January--recorded, broadcast in progress] 
  [Text] [Rabin] ...I will not make prophecies about what 
will happen in 10 days. We should wait 10 days, and find the 
degree of similarity between the Syrian and our interpretation 
of the term full peace, which they have been using. Naturally, 
there will be the question of what it will demand as the price 
for full peace according to our interpretation. 
  [Litman] You were quoted by the French media as saying that 
Israel can sign a peace agreement with Jordan, as far as you are 
concerned, in three weeks. What prevents signing a peace 
contract soon? 
  [Rabin] Jordan prevents this. 
  [Litman] Why? 
  [Rabin] I do not believe that today it is ready to be the 
first of the three Arab countries with which we are negotiating 
to sign a peace agreement with us. We have no problems of 
security nor problems linked to essential territorial aspects 
with Jordan. Today, the issue of the Palestinians, the future of 
the territories, is being discussed with the Palestinians, the 
PLO, and not with Jordan. Therefore, when we speak of peace 
with Jordan, we are referring to the border that existed between 
mandatory Eretz Yisra'el and Jordan. 
  There is another country with which we have no territorial 
problems, but have a security problem -- Lebanon. With it, 
matters are more complex. Also, its freedom of political 
maneuvering is more limited than that of Jordan. I am afraid 
that, apparently, Jordan also feels that it does not have enough 
freedom of political maneuvering to reach a peace accord with us.

Interparliamentary Union's conference and coordination at this

  Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' received Tahir al-Masri this 
morning. During the meeting, discussions dealt with 
developments in the peace process, Arab coordination, and the 
importance of the Geneva summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad 
and Bill Clinton in achieving a just, comprehensive peace in the 
region. 
  The speaker of the Jordanian House of Representatives

discussions during the visit will deal with some bilateral 
issues pertaining to the work of the two assemblies, general 
issues pertaining to the APU, and bilateral issues. Al- Masri 
said the visit is particularly important because it emphasizes 
interaction and communication between Jordan and Syria and 
between the two parliaments in the two sisterly countries. He 
also noted that he is looking forward to fruitful and useful 
meetings in Syria.

  [Text] British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has asserted 
that comprehensive peace in the Middle East will not be achieved 
without Jordan. This is because Jordan plays an important and 
vital role in the peace process. 
  The remarks were made in a news conference Hurd held in 
Amman 
this afternoon at the conclusion of a two-day visit to Jordan, 
during which he met with His Majesty King Husayn and the prime 
minister. Hurd also had talks on developments in the peace 
process and ways to enhance bilateral cooperation. 
  More details in the following report: 
  Hurd said his talks in Amman were positive and that Jordan 
and Britain look forward to making the peace process succeed, 
despite the existence of some difficulties, which should be 
overcome. He asserted that the peace process has passed the 
point of no return and it is impossible to go back. 
  Hurd expressed his full understanding of, and deep respect 
for, His Majesty King Husayn's view that all matters should be 
settled before any agreement with Israel is signed. He said: I 
fully understand the reasons that prompted his majesty to adopt 
this policy. He further said that much has been achieved on the 
Jordanian-Israeli track, noting that there are other things 
which should be done. 
  Hurd stressed his country's economic support for Jordan, 
saying: We have an economic aid program for Jordan and we will 
implement this program to support Jordan's needs. He pointed to 
his meeting today with the water minister and to Britain's role 
in extending aid to carry out a water project in southern 
Jordan. He also underlined the need to ease the burdens of 
Jordan's indebtedness and support its economy in facing many 
burdens as a result of the continued economic embargo against 
Iraq. He said he discussed with Jordanian officials ways to 
overcome difficulties to increase the volume of trade between 
Jordan and Britain. He added that he had discussed with 
Jordanian officials the negative impact of the economic embargo 
against Iraq, noting that Jordan feels that it bears a great 
burden as a result of this embargo, more than other neighboring 
countries of Iraq. 
  Hurd underscored his statements in the Gaza Strip yesterday 
before arriving in Amman in which he asserted his government's 
support for the Palestinian people through extending technical 
expertise directly or through the Economic Community and the 
United Nations, especially for the Palestinian self-rule region. 
He said: We cannot do more than this because the United States 
and Russia are directly responsible for the peace process. He 
asserted that the concerned parties in the region are determined 
to achieve peace and that the will for success is greater than 
failure, since failure means the return of tension to the region. 
  Hurd expressed his belief that Israel has no ambitions in 
Lebanon, pointing out that it seeks to protect its security and 
that it has no desire to annex Lebanese territory. He 
reaffirmed the need for Israel's implementation of relevant 
Security Council resolutions. He said that reaching a solution 
on the Lebanese-Israeli track can happen at the same time as 
other solutions on other tracks are being reached within a 
comprehensive solution. 
  He also expressed his belief that Arab-Israeli disputes are 
over. We are now in a stage of direct contacts and negotiations, 
which is the only course to achieve positive results and 
practical decisions and implement them. 
  He denied he was mediating between the Arabs and the 
Israelis, saying his tour of the region is aimed at listening to 
the views of the parties concerned, conveying views from one 
side to another, and helping clarify these ideas. 
  Hurd and his wife left Amman this afternoon for Malta on the 
fourth leg of his Middle East tour. He was seen off at the 
airport by Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign 
affairs; Nayif al-Hadid, the Foreign Ministry secretary general; 
senior Foreign Ministry officials, and the British ambassador in 
Amman.

  [Excerpt] With the participation of the worshipping masses, 
the political-religious rites of Friday prayers were staged 
today simultaneously all over the country. In Tehran, the 
Friday prayers were led by Hojjat ol-Eslam val Moselmin 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani. 
  At the beginning of his sermons, the acting Friday prayer 
leader of Tehran set out to describe the mission of the prophets 
and the battle between evil and righteousness. He said: After 
the passage of seven centuries since the mission of His Holiness 
Jesus Christ -- may peace be upon him -- humanity was in dire 
need of a new prophethood. Then the greatest miracle in the 
history of mankind occurred, and with the prophethood of the 
esteemed prophet of Islam, a comprehensive and all-embracing 
doctrine was created that was able to nurture human beings, 
build civilizations, and provide all the answers to all the 
needs of mankind in all eras and historical junctures. In this 
way, God was able to communicate His fundamental ethos to 
mankind through the Prophet's tongue. 
  Even at that time, the atheist and arrogant camp lined up 
against God's prophet, and stopped at nothing in their 
confrontation against the divine messenger. They were 
shamelessly ungrateful and employed the most violent and 
coercive measures to keep the history's most eternal truth 
well-hidden. However, this school of thought [Islam] was to 
become the architect of a great civilization, which has about 
1.5 billion followers today. During the last 15 years, the most 
beautiful manifestation of this civilization has been 
crystallized by the selflessness and the sacrifices of the 
nation of Iran. 
  Moreover, the president clarified: At present, history is 
witnessing the repeat of events that unfolded at the advent of 
Islam. The plight that the Islamic world faces today is the 
same as the one that the prophet had to endure during the early 
days of Islam. A glance at the conditions of Muslims in various 
parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kashmir, 
Bosnia, and Palestine, and the silence of the West toward their 
plight, testifies to this reality. 
  At the end of the first sermon, Hojjat ol-Eslam val Moslemin 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani stressed the need to consider the Prophet, 
his ethics, and his characteristics in life, worship, piety, and 
jehad as a model. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] In an interview with our 
reporter on the return of the Afghan refugees or their 
settlement in Iran, Interior Minister Mr. Besharati-Jahromi 
said: At present some 700,000 Afghan refugees live in our 
country. On the basis of a project prepared by the UNHCR a 
number of Afghan immigrants voluntarily returned home, before 
the recent civil war and fratricide in Afghanistan. As of next 
Nowruz [21 March 1994], the said project will be followed up; 
however, if there are some who desire to stay in Iran, then we 
will issue cards for them. [passage omitted] 
  The interior minister said Iraqi refugees in Iran numbered 
around 50,000.

  [Text] Islamabad, Jan 6 (AFP) -- Pakistan made a fervent 
appeal Thursday to warring Afghan factions in Kabul to agree to 
a 24 hour temporary cease-fire from Friday to evacuate diplomats 
and Afghans wounded in six days of fierce fighting. 
  A foreign office spokesman here expressed the Pakistan 
government's "deep regret" at the escalation of fighting in 
Kabul. He said the aerial bombardment was posing "greater danger 
to civilians" living in the war-weary Afghan capital. 
  He fervently appealed to all the Afghan factions involved in 
the clashes to agree to a temporary cease-fire for 24 hours 
starting from 6:00 p.m. (1100 GMT) Friday "so that all 
diplomatic and UN personnel living in Kabul and people wounded 
in the six days of fighting could be evacuated on emergency 
basis." 
  "The government of Pakistan hopes that all Afghan leaders 
would respond positively to this appeal," the spokesman said in 
a statement here. 
  Pakistan had earlier twice appealed for an immediate 
ceasefire in Kabul, scene of the worst power struggle, and other 
Afghan cities in the past few days. 
  It also urged all sides to hold political negotiations with 
the object of reviving the process of conciliation for lasting 
political settlement. The appeals have not yet been heeded. 
  Sources said the casualties in six days of bloody fighting 
Kabul had exceeded 3,300 with hundreds trapped in their homes 
awaiting medical asistance.

<F P=106> ['Ali Salih report: "'Arafat Received Seven Demands From </F>
Palestinian `Reform Delegation'"] 
  [Text] London -- At dawn today, the Palestinian "reform 
delegation" concluded its four-day meetings with the PLO 
Executive Committee in Tunis. A delegation member said that 
"during last night's meeting, the delegation submitted seven 
written specific reform points and asked the Executive Committee 
members to take a stand on them." 
  The "reform delegation," which is headed by Dr. Haydar 
'Abd-al-Shafi and includes seven other members, represents 120 
Palestinian figures from inside and outside the occupied 
territory who signed a document delivered to the PLO leadership 
last month calling on it to modernize the PLO's institutions and 
promote a democratic leadership that would end the 
decisionmaking monopoly. The member revealed that, upon 
returning to Amman, the delegation intends to invite the 
signatories of the reform document to a meeting in the Jordanian 
capital within the next few days to report to them on the talks. 
The member, who was talking to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT from Tunis, 
specified these points as follows: 
  1. Formation of a planning and consultative committee to 
include qualified Palestinians from all fields, especially those 
needed for building the national authority. 
  2. Formation of a committee for comprehensive national 
dialogue (to include Palestinian factions, figures, 
establishments, and other bodies) consisting of independent 
elements enjoying the respect of the Palestinian people with the 
aim of strengthening democracy. 
  3. Creation of a department for the development of 
manpower. Its task will be to identify the Palestinian people's 
manpower qualifications in all fields and to retrain and 
rehabilitate the present cadres of the PLO. 
  4. Creation of a national authority reference body in 
Gaza and Jericho from elements inside the occupied territory to 
fill the vacuum before and after the Israeli withdrawal until 
the emergence of the national authority. 
  5. Submission of the proposed constitution for discussion 
at popular level. 
  6. Submission of a "modern" electoral law for discussion 
at popular level. 
  7. Revival of the negotiation steering committees which 
supervised the negotiations. 
  The delegation member said that "Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat expressed reservations regarding the first point, 
pointing out that a planning council already exists and could be 
rejuvenated with the qualifications we propose." According to 
the member, 'Arafat is trying to find a compromise solution on 
that point. 
  On the second point, the delegation member said, 'Arafat 
agreed in principle to the formation of a dialogue committee, 
giving responsibility for it to Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi. The 
member added: "It can be said that 'Arafat did not agree to the 
formation of the kind of committee that we are calling for, one 
that would initiate a comprehensive dialogue with all the 
establishments and bodies inside and outside the occupied 
territory, not just a dialogue committee with only the 
opposition factions, to create an atmosphere of popular unity 
and of opposition to infighting, and to discuss points of 
agreement and come up with binding decisions." 
  In reply to a question about the positions of 'Arafat and 
the 
other PLO Executive Committee members on the other points, he 
said that "they were not seriously discussed in the earlier 
meetings. Discussion was deferred until the final session which 
continued until dawn today." Asked about guarantees for the 
implementation of these demands, the member said: "To ensure 
implementation, we submitted a mechanism for the implementation 
of each proposal that would indicate the leadership's 
seriousness about its promises and would enable us to request 
implementation once the proposal is approved." 
  On the positions of the Executive Committee members, the 
delegation member said that seven Executive Committee members, 
including 'Arafat, attended the meetings and that their 
positions can be summed up as follows: 
  1. 'Ali Ishaq (Palestine Liberation Front) (Abu-al-'Abbas): 
He did not comment but he did show some kind of displeasure. 
  2. Samir Ghawshah (Popular Struggle Front): Expressed 
reservations about the creation of new institutions. He called 
instead for the reactivation of the existing institutions. 
  3. Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu Mazin) (Fatah): He supported the 
demands. 
  4. Faruq Qaddumi (Abu-al-Lutf) (Fatah): He did not 
attend the last two meetings because he was in Amman but he 
insisted on giving his opinion of all the points. His position 
was positive. 
  5. Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh (Fida): His position was positive. 
  6. Sulayman al-Najjab (People's Party): He accepted all 
the demands.

Yasir 'Arafat. In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT made after 
the conclusion of the meetings he and his delegation held with 
the Executive Committee and before leaving Tunis for Jordan 
yesterday, he said that "'Arafat is still monopolizing the 
decisionmaking, and I believe that the Executive Committee 
members are making it easy for him to continue to do so by 
accepting that he is the decisionmaker." 
  Reacting to the fact that some committee members had 
reaffirmed opposition to 'Arafat's decisionmaking monopoly, 
'Abd-al-Shafi said that "in practical terms they are all in the 
same boat and do not dare to reveal their positions." 
  Palestinian sources in Tunis had said yesterday that 'Arafat 
and the PLO Executive Committee made some concessions regarding 
some of the reform demands submitted in writing by the 
delegation to the Executive Committee at dawn yesterday. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi warned, however, that if 'Arafat did not 
carry out what was outlined in the reform memorandum then there 
would again be recourse to the PLO's legitimate institutions, 
"and after that we would seek the verdict of the masses." He 
added that there was an inclination to submit that memorandum to 
the Palestine Central Council. 
  In his statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT 'Abd-al-Shafi said 
that 
he expected 'Arafat to appeal to the Palestinian opposition for 
the start of a broad national dialogue and then, subsequent to 
the appeal, make incessant efforts to persuade the opposition to 
participate in that broad dialogue. 
  He added: "At any rate, we have clearly conveyed to 
President 'Arafat and the Executive Committee the Palestinian 
masses' insistence on and expectation of democratic decisions. 
The leadership must give this matter the necessary 
consideration if we do not want to face more problems, because 
in the absence of democratic practices and a democratic approach 
partisan and ideological disputes would intensify and could 
develop into armed conflicts. Such disputes can only be 
eliminated through commitment to the principle of democracy." 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi underlined the need for a new mechanism 
within the PLO to help the Executive Committee apply the rules 
of democratic action in the future. [passage omitted]

  [Text] At a news conference held yesterday [6 January] in 
Tunis, Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi [head of delegation conducting 
talks on democratic reform with PLO leadership] announced that 
brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], the president of the state 
of Palestine and chairman of the PLO Executive Committee, held 
four meetings with seven members of the Palestinian National 
Council to discuss proposals they had put forward to entrench 
the democratic conception and consolidate the unity of our 
people on the basis of political plurality and democratic 
practices. 
  We have come in response to an invitation from brother 
President Abu-'Ammar, he said. He added that President 'Arafat 
will address an appeal concerning the democratic national 
dialogue with all Palestinian forces and factions, and 
immediately afterward he ['Arafat] will begin this dialogue. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi also said: We hope this invitation will 
receive good responses and understanding from everyone and 
contribute toward the realization and entrenchment of the 
overall national unity. 
  He added: During those meetings with President 'Arafat, we 
emphasized the necessity to recall the qualified Palestinians in 
various fields to build the Palestinian objectives, a matter 
that requires the existence of an actual democratic practice, 
and this is what our memorandum stressed. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi added that the response to the proposals 
of 
the group was that some of those proposals were already in 
practice, and that there was a council that planned and 
exercised this required role. [sentence as heard] We have 
requested the activation of this body, and with regard to human 
resources, we expressed our desire to be selected according to 
qualifications and competence. 
  Concerning the Construction and Economic Development 
Council, 
the response was that there was a special bureau that was in 
charge of that matter. 
  Concerning the consultative committees within and outside 
the 
occupied territories, the response was that the national 
authority will be composed from people inside and outside [the 
occupied territories], and the authority council will undertake 
whatever was necessary -- such as the setting up of committees 
and dealing with other questions, such as municipal affairs. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi stressed that during these deliberations, 
the need to firmly establish the democratic concept and begin 
the national dialogue were emphasized in order to realize 
comprehensive national unity.

<F P=106> [Special to the JORDAN TIMES by Wafa' 'Amr] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Chief Palestinian negotiator to bilateral 
talks with Israel, Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, said Saturday [8 
January] that the reformists' talks with the Palestinian 
leadership in Tunis were "in principle successful" due to the 
leadership's awareness to the importance of adopting democracy. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi returned from Tunis Thursday after talks 
with the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) leadership. He 
headed a seven-member team representing 120 Palestinian 
officials and personalities who demanded democratic reforms 
within the PLO structure and an end to PLO Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat's "autocratric" decision-making style. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi said that during talks with the PLO 
leadership and the Executive Committee, there has been a 
positive response to the reformists' demands and he felt 
satisfied with Mr. 'Arafat's support for the democratisation of 
the PLO. 
  "I would say, in principle, in terms of matters of the depth 
of awareness of our leadership, and of the people in general, 
that the importance of democratising the structure of the PLO 
and of adopting democracy in our political life as a whole have 
been supported very much by the leadership," Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi 
told reporters. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi held a meeting with around 60 reformists 
at 
the Palestine National Council (PNC) headquarters Saturday to 
brief them on the outcome of the team's trip to Tunis. 
  He said the results of the team's talks with the PLO 
leadership were "positive" and said: "Any talk about the 
failure of our mission or any impression given that it was 
negative would be inaccurate." 
  He said he felt there was response to the demands for reform 
but not all demands as stated in a statement that was signed by 
120 figures and sent to the leadership last month. 
  "I don't see any reason why reforms would not be 
implemented. 
However, reform is a long process," he said. 
  He alluded to the fact that Mr. 'Arafat remains to be the 
only decision-maker in the PLO at this point and that the PLO's 
democratic institutions and collective leadership bodies remain 
inactive or dormant at this stage. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi said the reformists submitted the 
statement 
again to the PLO leadership in Tunis and they provided it with 
suggestions to implement reforms and democratisation. "There 
was response to our demands, and the statement was endorsed by 
the Executive Committee, but not all demands were accepted," he 
added. 
  "Expanding the decision-making body and collective 
leadership 
cannot be done at this stage," Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi said. "It is 
unacceptable that Abu-'Ammar ('Arafat) alone makes the 
decisions." 
  Other members of the team felt satisfied with the fact that 
the leadership had taken their movement seriously and accepted 
to open a democratic deialogue with them in order to implement 
changes. They are not under the illusion that reforms would 
immediately take place, but they hope to remain a strong force, 
working as an internal pressure group that would monitor the 
leadership's actions and continue to call for democratisation 
through popular pressure. 
  Popular insistence on carrying out elections in the occupied 
territories was one way of achieving change, Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi 
said. "We will reject any delay to carrying out elections as 
stated in the PLO-Israel accord." 
  "The democratic issue is not the decision of Abu-'Ammar 
alone. It is a matter in which all the people should 
participate." he said. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi said the prospective popular dialogue that 
will take place on a wide scale among Palestinians inside and 
outside the occupied territories will also have an impact on the 
leadership and allow for reforms. He was referring to a 
decision by the PLO leadership approving a dialogue between all 
Palestinian factions, inside and outside the framework of the 
PLO, to work towards uniting the Palestinian people. Mr. 
'Arafat designated Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi to initiate this dialogue 
and Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi accepted. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-shafi said that he found the spirit of the 
Executive Committee "not rejectionist to our calls for 
democratic reforms but not actively supportive. But I can say 
our mission was successful."

<F P=106> ["Text" of statement issued by PLO Executive Committee] </F>
  [Text] The PLO Executive Committee, out of the position of 
its responsibilities and continuous concern and care for our 
Palestinian people's higher interests and glorious struggle and 
holy jihad, reaffirms anew the principles of democratic 
dialogue, political plurality, the respect of views, and the 
practice of democracy. Today it addresses the sons of our 
Palestinian people everywhere and in all places of residence on 
the beloved homeland or in the areas of gathering outside it, 
and all its political and social forces, and all its patriotic 
activities and jamahiri organizations, and all our brothers in 
the Palestinian detachments and the nationalist personalities, 
in order to reaffirm anew the importance of consolidating our 
national unity -- especially in these fateful and decisive times 
we are all passing through. It calls for more cohesion and 
unity at this great battleground and in the labor pains in which 
we are living and working, in order to realize the establishment 
of a patriotic Palestinian authority to complete the Israeli 
withdrawal from the Gaza sector and the Jericho area as a first 
step along the path of retrieving the inalienable national 
rights of our Palestinian people and the establishment of our 
independent Palestinian state whose capital is Holy Jerusalem. 
  Now that we are about to enter, with God's permission and 
His 
assistance, a new major, important, and historic period to be 
characterized by the creation of the first Palestinian authority 
in contemporary history on the land of our beloved homeland, 
this requires us all to work together in order to reconstruct 
and rebuild the national infrastructures, institutions, and 
bodies at all the political, economic, social, and institutional 
levels. 
  Therefore at these crucial and historic moments, we are 
inviting all the national forces, factions, unions, 
institutions, and figures to meet and stress what brings us 
together and not what separates us and let those assembled 
adhere to the former. This should be entrenched in the minds 
and souls of everyone, in order to build our free and proud 
homeland for a people of freemen, militants, fighters, and 
believers. This will be a homeland of unity, light, hope, and 
faith which will be able to gain the trust of the people of the 
world who following this unique Palestinian experiment. 
  The PLO Executive Committee welcomes the efforts made by 
some 
brethren with a view to strengthening national unity and 
reinforcing the bases of the democratic process and regards 
these efforts as a blessed action which proves the health and 
vitality of the Palestinian arena and our people's determination 
to rally around the Palestine Liberation Organization which 
leads its national struggle. Therefore, the PLO Executive 
Committee calls on all the Palestinian brethren and factions to 
contribute to the enrichment of the national dialogue and its 
deepening in order to strengthen our capacity to complete the 
recovery of our inalienable national rights, including our 
people's right to return, self-determination, and the 
establishment of their independent state with holy Jerusalem as 
its capital. 
  This is the time for unity and not for disunion. This is the 
time for solidarity which is based on common denominators and 
not on elements of division. This is the time for joint action, 
and let amity govern our practices and our relations and what we 
agree on and what we disagree on. Let us come together, hand-in 
hand, to wage our sacred battle to build the Palestinian 
national entity; and let us direct our attention to the national 
interest of our people, our homeland, and nation within the 
framework of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole 
legitimate representative of our people, the protector of its 
interests and the leader of its struggle. 
  The revolution will continue until victory.

  [Text] Tunis, Jan 9 (AFP) -- The PLO executive committee 
has approved a cooperation accord signed with Jordan and 
reviewed the progress of economic negotiations with Israel, PLO 
sources said Sunday [9 January]. 
  The committee met overnight Saturday under the chairmanship 
of PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat to listen to briefings by the 
organisation's political department chief Faruq Qaddumi on the 
Jordan negotiations and Ahmad Quray', the head of the delegation 
holding economic talks with Israel in Paris. 
  The Jordan-Palestine Liberation Organisation accord, signed 
Friday, followed the broad outlines of a draft economic deal 
Amman had wanted signed. 
  Both sides have praised the agreement which calls for 
setting 
up Jordanian banks and using the Jordanian dinar in the occupied 
territories as the main currency, cooperating in trade and 
investing jointly in industry, agriculture, tourism, health and 
other domains. 
  The executive committee endorsed the Jordan declaration, 
member 'Ali Ishaq told AFP. 
  King Husayn had become increasingly irritated by 'Arafat's 
handling of the peace process and warned the PLO that he was 
giving it a final chance to agree on cooperation. 
  Stock market officials in Jordan said Sunday the accord had 
triggered a 3.7 percent rise in Amman's stock market activity. 
  The volume of exchange transactions has also registered an 
increase with an average of 11.3 million dinars (about 16 
million dollars) per day, approaching the 1992 record of 16.5 
million dollars daily. The size of exchange had been stable at 
around 15 million dollars per day during 1993. 
  The PLO executive also reviewed the latest achievements in 
talks held with Israel on economic cooperation, based on a 
report by Quray', who is also known as Abu-Ala'. 
  The next round of economic talks will be held Monday and 
Tuesday. 
  "We have not registered tangible progress," said a member of 
the PLO executive who requested anonymity. 
  "Any progress in the economic talks remains dependent on the 
evolution of the political negotiations process," Ishaq said. 
  The economic cooperation talks have snagged over the 
question 
of finance and money with the PLO insisting on issuing its own 
currency and central bank as part of the future autonomy.

<F P=106> [Report by Yosi Torpstein] </F>
  [Excerpt] The three Fatah activists in Hebron who 
announced their resignations a few days ago, said Friday [7 
January] that they would vacate their decision. They made the 
decision after talking with PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat, who 
promised that Force 17 in Hebron was not set up at his 
instruction nor that of the organization's leadership. 'Arafat 
blamed "an Arab intelligence apparatus" (he was apparently 
referring to Jordan) for setting up the body. 
  The activists who withdrew their resignations -- Jibril 
al-Bakri, Dhiyab al-Sharabati, and Ihsan al-Nazir -- telephoned 
'Arafat Friday night in order to inform him that they resigned 
because of organizational deviations by the Fatah leadership, 
various appointments in the region, and an attempt to set up a 
security apparatus, Force 17. The activists said that "bad 
elements, which have always been outside the national consensus 
and constitute the remnants of the village associations, headed 
by Muhammad al-Nasir, are responsible for the establishment of 
the force. 
  A message sent to 'Arafat in the name of the activists in 
the 
various Fatah committees in the region was disseminated Friday. 
It detailed the reasons for the resignations and the demand to 
correct Fatah's internal situation, including the election of 
the organization's committees by mass conferences and democratic 
elections. 
  'Arafat made clear to the three activists his positions on 
the issues they raised and called on them to withdraw their 
resignations. He stressed that no order has been issued by any 
authorized body in Fatah Tunis for the establishment of "a 
presidential guard apparatus" or "Force 17 militias" in the 
territories. He said that Fatah has nothing to do with any 
militia or with Muhammad al-Nasir. 
  'Arafat told the three that a hostile Arab intelligence 
service is behind "the announcements about appointments and the 
establishment of bodies outside Fatah's legal organizational 
framework." He claimed that only the organizational framework 
that existed prior to 13 September is considered legal and 
binding, and that Fatah's central committee in the Hebron area 
would be in charge of dealing with all the attempts by others to 
intervene in Fatah affairs. 
  Despite the tension among Fatah activists in the Hebron 
region, a festive gathering was held in East Jerusalem by Fatah 
activists in the town on the occasion of the 29th anniversary of 
the organization's establishment, which really took place on 1 
January. Activists who participated in the event said the delay 
was because "the Jerusalem gathering was held after similar 
events took place in various regions, in order to underline the 
fact that Jerusalem is the capital of Falastin, where the main 
rally was held." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Catastrophe of the Vatican's Recognition of </F>
Israel"] 
  [Text] The Vatican's recognition of Israel and 
normalization of relations with it after 200 years of hostility 
and disagreement was a new shock for all the Arabs, particularly 
as that recognition was at the expense of the Arabs, their 
territory, and their sanctities and in the interest of Israel, 
its racism, and its control of the Arab territories. 
  As the papal envoy visits the occupied Arab territories in 
Palestine, the Israeli Army continues to kill innocent people 
with live ammunition and continues to throw more detainees in 
its prisons which now have 11,000 prisoners, some of them 
children. 
  We find it difficult to understand the Vatican's haste in 
normalizing relations with Israel and signing an agreement with 
it condoning its occupation of Arab territories and Judaiazation 
of Jerusalem. The Vatican, which refrained from taking such a 
step for 2,000 years, could have waited a few more years to see 
the outcome of the current peace efforts in the region. 
  We do not believe that the Christian spiritual leadership 
accepts the injustice, the occupation, the coercion, the 
confiscation of land, the building of settlement, and the 
prevention of family reunions. 
  That is why we are surprised by this eagerness to establish 
full diplomatic relations with an entity that commits all these 
excesses and violations of human rights and international laws 
and charters. 
  We could understand a Third World state establishing 
relations with Israel because it needed so-called aid and 
expertise or because it believed that Israel was the most 
effective channel for reaching the heart of the White House and 
its financial and economic aid, but we cannot understand the 
Vatican taking such a step. It is not a state and it does not 
need a mediator to reach Washington. Quite the contrary, 
Washington is the one that needs the pope's blessing and 
satisfaction. Furthermore, the Vatican is not a state seeking 
to expand its commercial relations and seek new markets for its 
products and exports. 
  The Vatican would not have taken such a step had the Arab 
situation not been at its worst and had the Palestinian people, 
Muslims and Christians, not been besieged by brothers before 
being besieged by enemies. 
  It is regrettable that the current state of Arab division 
does not encourage anyone to respect the Arabs and their causes 
or to take them and their interests into consideration. The 
picture was different when the Arabs were strong and united and 
when there was Arab solidarity. Others would have had to think 
a thousand times before taking a step that would anger any Arab 
state. 
  We hope that this fatal Vatican blow will serve as a lesson 
to those who are placing obstacles in the way of Arab 
reconciliation and restoration of Arab solidarity, because the 
danger of these divisions which have weakened the Arabs and 
shaken their world image is getting closer to their own 
doorsteps. The coming days will prove that they are not safe no 
matter how much money, arms, and Western support they have. 
  If the loss of Jerusalem, its Judaiaization, and the 
building 
of a belt of settlements around it to obliterate its Arab 
identity has not moved them, we do not believe that their state 
of health is sound nor that their political situation is normal 
to enable them to face any danger that threatens them. 
  The Vatican's recognition of Israel on Israeli terms is an 
insult to all the Arabs and Muslims without exception because 
the consequences of that recognition will be a catastrophe for 
all, without exception. 
  The Zionist movement, after Arab failure caused the label of 
racism to be lifted from it at the United Nations, is, after 
this major recognition of the state of Israel and its occupation 
of Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied territories, now ready 
to surge forward, expand, gain new legitimacy for its ideology, 
and build even larger and more dangerous alliances in the region 
at the expense of Arabism and all the human, cultural, and 
civilized values and ethics it represents.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Awaiting the next round of 
multilateral meetings, the Movement of the Islamic Society 
[HAMAS] announced today that it would participate in the 
upcoming national dialogue conference. 
  Mr. Mahfoud Nahnah, head of the movement, expressed his 
hopes 
in an interview published today in L'OPINION that the date of 
that conference would not be postponed. 
  On the project of the national consensus platform drawn up 
by 
the National Dialogue Commission, Mr. Mahfoud Nahnah said it 
contained a number of proposals put forward by parties involved 
in the dialogue. He stressed that, on the whole, there seemed to 
be an acceptable consensus even if it remained limited. 
  The head of HAMAS reiterated his call to include 
representatives from the dissolved Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] 
and said he considered the success of the national conference to 
be linked to the participation of the largest possible number of 
tendencies. 
  On the other hand, the National Constitutional Rally 
announced its continued participation in the next rounds of 
dialogue attended by all sides. The National Constitutional 
Rally, which is a coalition of 12 political parties, expressed 
in a statement the necessity of adopting dialogue as a means and 
method to contain the political crisis. 
  The rally stressed its determination to continue dialogue 
with the National Dialogue Commission to reach a consensus on 
the concord platform, and to exert all efforts to find safe ways 
to resolve and to contain the political crisis in the presence 
of all sides in the dialogue without marginalization, exclusion, 
outbidding, or imposed leadership.

  [Text] Regarding the security situation, Mohamed Belahcen, 
an official responsible for religious affairs in Ain Defla 
Province, was assassinated yesterday after the Friday prayers. 
The victim was 62 years old and was the imam of the Ghinali 
mosque in Medea. 
  Six civilians were assassinated last week in El Tarf, Oum El 
Bouaghi, and Mostaganem provinces. In El Tarf Province, three 
militants of the FLN [National Liberation Front] were 
assassinated with knives on the night of 2 January after the 
hunting rifles in their possession were taken from them. 
  In Oum El Bouaghi Province, the first deputy chairman of the 
executive authority of the (Ouled Hamda) municipality was 
assassinated the day before yesterday. Also the day before 
yesterday, in Mostaganem Province a retired health service 
employee was assassinated at the exit of the mosque in the town 
of Mostaganem. 
  Meanwhile the security authorities said that they had killed 
four members of armed gangs and had arrested four others in the 
center and east of the country.

  [Text] Speaking on the eve of the resumption of the Taba 
talks, Dr. Nabil Sha'th, the head of the Palestinian delegation, 
estimates that it will be possible to reach and formulate a 
detailed agreement within the two weeks allocated for the 
negotiations. Sha'th said that for all intents and purposes both 
parties have already agreed on most of the issues: the 
timetable for the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal; the 
size of the Palestinian police force; security along the 
borders, on the roads, and inside the territories; and a safe 
passageway between the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
  In an interview with our correspondent Moti Amir, Nabil 
Sha'th said that there were still disagreements on the issues of 
Jericho and the border crossings, on the security zones around 
the settlements, and also with regard to the division of 
responsibilities between the Palestinian towns and the Jewish 
settlements on matters of mutual concern. 
  As for the crisis in the Cairo talks, Sha'th says the whole 
affair was an unnecessary furor caused by premature 
announcements. Sha'th said that if the crisis had been put off 
for another week, the Palestinian and Israeli teams might have 
signed the agreement that they had already almost completed.

  [Text] Israel and the PLO agreed over the weekend that the 
Taba talks will be held continuously, until an agreement is 
reached. The talks will be held in a special wing [of the Taba 
Hilton Hotel] which will be closed to the media. Political 
sources said this evening that if the PLO brings up for the 
discussion the issue of border crossings, Israel will be willing 
to deal with only cosmetic matters, and not with Israel's 
responsibility in principle over the crossings. 
  The prime minister's bureau this evening made haste to deny 
the remarks of Tzomet Knesset Member Eli'ezer Zandberg that the 
IDF [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal from the Gaza Strip will 
begin on 22 February.

  [Text] Cairo, 9 Jan (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political 
adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, has emphasized 
that Egypt's support for the Palestinian negotiating delegation 
has been and will remain strong. He noted that President Husni 
Mubarak and Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa are making major efforts 
to support the Palestinian delegation. 
  Sha'th left Cairo today for Taba to attend the Gaza-Jericho 
talks. In a departure statement, he said that the Palestinian 
delegation will negotiate without preconditions, except for its 
commitment to the Declaration of Principles signed with Israel, 
and it will capitalize on the progress made in the talks held 
during the past three months. 
  The Gaza-Jericho Committee will resume its meetings in Taba 
tomorrow, Monday, between the Palestinian side led by Dr. Sha'th 
and the Israeli side led by Assistant Chief of Staff Amnon 
Shahaq. 
  Sha'th said the aim of the talks is to reach an agreement 
with the Israeli side on all contentious issues, which would 
allow the agreement to be implemented in the next three weeks. 
He added: We believe that this period is enough, provided that 
there is goodwill on the Israeli side. If we manage to conclude 
an agreement quickly, there will be a chance for a meeting 
between Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to sign and begin implementing the 
agreement.

  [Text] Taba, 9 Jan (MENA)--The Palestinian-Israeli 
committee concerned with implementing the Gaza-Jericho accord 
will begin meeting in Taba tomorrow. The Palestinian side will 
be headed by Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to Palestinian 
president Yasir 'Arafat. The Israeli delegation will be headed 
by Deputy Chief of Staff General Amnon Shahaq. 
  The security committee and the drafting committee are 
scheduled to meet tomorrow. The civil committee concerned with 
the transfer of the self-rule powers will meet in Taba on 
Tuesday [11 January]. This round of talks is scheduled to 
continue until Friday and will resume next week on Sunday or 
Monday. 
  Dr. Sha'th held a meeting this evening with the Palestinian 
delegation members, who arrived in Taba this afternoon, to 
prepare the working papers that will be submitted to the Israeli 
side. Dr. Sha'th stated that the negotiations will continue for 
three weeks until all the steps relevant to the transfer of 
power to the Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho are prepared. He 
defined these steps as the issue of the crossings, the size of 
the Jericho area, and security along the sea and in the Israeli 
settlements in the Gaza Strip. He noted that the Israeli 
withdrawal is scheduled to be completed before 13 April. He 
pointed out that postponing Israeli withdrawal after this date 
will be considered a violation of the Declaration of Principles. 
  Dr. Sha'th stressed that no agreement will be signed until 
after a timetable has been worked out to release the remaining 
Palestinian detainees in Israeli jails, noting that their number 
now ranges between 9,600 and 9,700. He noted that Israel's 
release of 101 Palestinian detainees recently is merely a 
gesture of good will. He said that the Taba talks will resume 
because the Israeli side gave up its claims of the existence of 
"a Cairo document" for the negotiations, noting that during the 
Cairo talks six working papers were submitted, but nothing in 
them has been settled.

  [Text] Taba, 10 Jan (MENA)--Palestinian-Israeli talks to 
implement the Palestinian self-rule agreement in Gaza and 
Jericho opened in Taba at 1100 today. Dr. Nabil Sha'th, 
adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, and Amnon 
Shahaq, Israeli deputy chief of staff, are heading the 
delegations. 
  The Palestinian team includes Major General 'Abd-al-Razzaq 
al-Yahya, Kamil Mansur, Yazid Sani', Rami Sha'th, Khalid 
al-Qidrah, Hasan 'Asfur, Jamil al-Tarifi, Zuhdi al-Qidrah, and 
Muhammad Daflan. 
  The Israeli team includes Uzi Dayan, chief of planning at 
the 
General Staff; Ya'qov Neriah, policy adviser to Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin; Zvike Shtauber, deputy chief of planning at the 
General Staff; and Joel Zinger, legal adviser to the Foreign 
Ministry. 
  Palestinian sources say the meetings will continue 
uninterrupted until Thursday or Friday morning and will resume 
next week; they will last three weeks. 
  The subcommittee discussing the transfer of autonomy power 
will begin its meeting in Taba tomorrow morning chaired by Zuhdi 
al-Qidrah. 
  The Palestinian delegation arrived in Taba from Cairo at 
noon 
yesterday while the Israeli delegation headed by General Shahaq 
arrived at 1030 today. 
  Tight security measures were taken inside and around the 
hotel and reporters were not allowed to approach the delegates. 
  [In a related report, Paris AFP in English at 0944 GMT on 10 
January adds the following: "Israel and the PLO returned to the 
negotiating table at this Red Sea resort on Monday with chief 
Palestinian negotiator Nabil Sha'th confidently predicting an 
accord within three weeks. 
  ["`I don't think it will take any more than two-three 
weeks,' 
Sha'th told reporters as he went into the talks seeking to iron 
out differences over the implementation of the September 13 
autonomy agreement. 
  ["`We have to finish as soon as possible and we are ready. 
If there is goodwill from both sides, and I believe there is, 
it will be done. 
  ["`Today the purpose of the discussion will be a general 
review of where we are and a plan to finish in three weeks.' 
  ["Sha'th offered reporters an image of how much work 
remained 
saying if the agreement represents 100 pages only two pages 
still had to be completed. 
  ["But he added: `The most difficult issue is willingness to 
finish.' 
  ["Sha'th accused Israeli Environment Minister Yosi Sarid of 
violating the agreement when he stated Sunday that he expected 
the talks to last two months. 
  ["`It is said when publicly you say it will take two months, 
it is violating the agreement,' Sha'th charged. 
  ["Israel delegation spokesman Colonel Ami Gluska said: `I 
think Mr. Sha'th's estimations are too optimistic and the 
negotiations should last longer because a lot of problems 
remain.' 
  ["The two delegations held a brief plenary session at the 
Hilton Hotel and then Sha'th and Shahaq went into a meeting 
alone."]

  [Excerpts] Taba, 10 Jan (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, adviser 
to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, has stated that the 
Palestinian and Israeli delegations came to Taba to draft the 
final agreement during the current round of negotiations, which 
he said is expected to continue for three weeks. [passage 
omitted] 
  Asked about Israel's claims that the so-called Cairo 
document 
is the only basis for negotiations, Dr. Sha'th said that that 
which is agreed upon and signed will be the basis. This was the 
case with the Declaration of Principles, which was initialed in 
Oslo, he said, noting that the Cairo draft was not signed. We 
must not overtake events, he said. 
  He explained that the Cairo document includes some disputed 
issues that must be resolved. But he said there are many points 
of agreement, which makes us hope a final agreement will be 
reached. 
  On a linkage between the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations 
and 
the upcoming summit between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and 
U.S. President Bill Clinton, Sha'th stressed that the summit is 
a contributing, not a frustrating, factor for the 
Palestinian-Israeli talks. We want Syria to return to the peace 
process armed with its right to a full Israeli withdrawal from 
the Golan, he said. When this happens, he added, it will 
reflect positively on the peace process and the 
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. [passage omitted] 
  Sha'th denied that Jordan told the Israelis it rejects a 
Palestinian presence on the crossings between Jericho and the 
Jordanian border. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Hasan 'Asfur, member of the PLO delegation </F>
to the Taba talks, by 'Umar Zaydani in Taba on 10 January, 
carried within the "With the Midday Events" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Zaydani] Mr. Hasan 'Asfur, member of the PLO 
delegation to the Taba talks. Let us begin with a statement 
made by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in which he says that the 
Taba talks are being conducted on the basis of an understanding 
reached in Cairo and on the basis of Dr. Nabil Sha'th's remarks 
on this, and not on the basis of the remarks sent by Yasir 
'Arafat. 
  ['Asfur] As a matter of fact, the joint statement issued by 
the Palestinian and Israeli sides to resume the negotiations in 
Taba states that the basis of negotiations is the Declaration of 
Principles signed on 13 September 1993 and the understandings 
reached in Cairo. Besides, the remarks sent by Dr. Nabil Sha'th 
to Amnon Shahaq were made by Yasir 'Arafat. Therefore, there 
are no personal remarks by Dr. Nabil Sha'th. These remarks 
represent the reservations of President Yasir 'Arafat. 
  [Zaydani] There is an impression that the negotiations have 
been going on for months, and each time we go back to the same 
issues: the crossings, protection of roads, the size of the 
Jericho area, and the transfer of civil powers. Has there been 
no progress? 
  ['Asfur] The truth is that the negotiations which have been 
going on for around three months did not only address these 
issues. They also addressed all issues pertaining to the Gaza 
agreement, the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and the 
size of the Jericho area, in all their aspects. Discussions 
dealt with all details. There are understandings on several 
issues, but the recent differences over these three points -- 
which emerged as three major issues in the negotiations -- 
created this impression that there has been no progress on any 
aspects. The truth is that this is not an accurate picture of 
what is going on at the negotiations. There are major and minor 
differences, and we are trying to overcome all difficulties. We 
hope to make progress that will end this long process of 
negotiations, which started three months ago, and to implement 
the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area. 
This is what we are seeking in the days ahead. 
  [Zaydani] How do you explain the variation in optimism 
between you and the Israeli delegation? You are talking about 
two or three weeks while the Israelis are talking about two or 
three months? 
  ['Asfur] It is not that we have determined how long things 
will go on. It is an expression of the nature of our 
understanding of the implementation of this agreement and the 
translation of the protocol of Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza 
Strip and the Jericho area. We believe that with hard work and 
without wasting time and avoiding direct responsibility on both 
sides, we can reach agreement within two or three weeks maximum. 
This is what we will try to do, if we really want to end this 
long process of negotiations. 
  [Zaydani] Do you think that the Taba talks will be clearer, 
given the recent crisis that happened with the Liaison Committee 
in Cairo? 
  ['Asfur] What happened in Cairo was not a crisis. It was 
only a misunderstanding of some of the issues during the 
discussions and how each side dealt with these issues. Finally, 
an understanding was reached to overcome what happened in Cairo. 
We think that the Taba talks will produce clearer answers about 
what happened, especially since there are understandings about 
some issues. We have covered a considerable distance in areas 
of understanding, even regarding complicated issues. We can say 
that during the recent negotiations, the Palestinian side has 
offered perceptions that give practical solutions. We hope that 
the Israeli side will understand the Palestinian understandings 
without pushing in directions which express a unilateral vision 
of the negotiations -- something which we do not want as a 
negotiating party. 
  [Zaydani] Do you agree with Deputy Foreign Minister Dr. Yosi 
Beilin that the most important thing in the negotiations is the 
ability of the Israeli and Palestinian sides to overcome 
differences and reach an understanding? 
  ['Asfur] No doubt the desire, ability, positive intentions, 
and abandoning the mentality of pressures to achieve 
instantaneous or personal gains by any party -- especially if 
this party believes itself to be the strongest party -- will 
make the negotiations take a positive course and achieve 
progress. However, if the other view prevails, using pressure 
through the logic of strength and weakness, then this will not 
enable the negotiations to achieve any results. This we do not 
want to happen. 
  [Zaydani] Will the Taba talks continue uninterrupted until 
agreement is reached? 
  ['Asfur] This is what we, as a Palestinian party, want. I 
believe there is initial understanding with the Israeli side. 
We will know for sure today. We want continuous negotiations 
until we reach an agreement. Perhaps, there might be technical 
halts, on Fridays and Saturdays for religious and practical 
reasons, but we will try to give as much of our time to the 
negotiations as we can. 
  [Zaydani] Mr. Hasan 'Asfur, member of the Palestinian 
delegation to the Taba talks, thank you very much. 
  ['Asfur] You are welcome.

  [Text] Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jabir al-Sabah, Kuwait's 
deputy premier and foreign minister, and Ahmad Bin-Jasim Al 
Thani, Qatar's foreign minister, arrived in Damascus today. 
They were received at Damascus International Airport by Foreign 
Minister Faruq al-Shar', a number of top Foreign Ministry 
officials, the Kuwaiti ambassador in Damascus, and the Qatari 
charge d'affaires in Damascus. 
  Shaykh Sabah made a statement to a SANA correspondent. He 
said: We are here to attend the meeting of the eight countries 
that signed the Damascus Declaration and believe in the 
declaration's principles. These principles have three focal 
points: cooperation in the political, economic, and military 
fields. 
  He added: We hope that cooperation among us in the political 
field will increase. As for economic cooperation, we will 
continue discussing the agreements reached in the recent meeting 
held by the finance ministers. Concerning military cooperation, 
it is carried out on a bilateral level among the eight 
countries. He said: We are happy to meet in Damascus in order 
to renew the principles of the Damascus Declaration that were 
announced in Damascus. 
  In a statement to a SANA correspondent, Shaykh Hamad 
Bin-Jasim Al Thani said: We, in Qatar, are concerned to have 
the Damascus Declaration as a nucleus for understanding and a 
new Arab order. During this meeting, we will hold discussions 
with the rest of the ministers on certain developments in the 
Arab arena as well as other developments to serve the Damascus 
Declaration countries and the Arab nation. He hope that the 
summit between President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President 
Clinton will result in progress on the Syrian and Lebanese 
tracks.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ibrahim Al-Musa, Kuwaiti </F>
ambassador in Syria and member of the Kuwaiti delegation to 
Damascus Declaration conference, in Damascus, by Shihatah 
Abu-al-Majd, in Cairo, on the "Dialogue From Afar" program; date 
not given--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Abu-al-Majd] What are the 
main topics on the agenda of the Damascus Declaration foreign 
ministers' meeting in light of the current Middle East and world 
developments? 
  [Al-Musa] The ministers will discuss many issues concerning 
not only the Damascus Declaration signatory countries but also 
the entire Arab nation and this region. [passage omitted] 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Naturally, Kuwait will focus on one specific 
issue: The security in the Gulf in light of the Iraqi threats 
and the prisoners issue. Of course, you will stress specific 
issues at this meeting. 
  [Al-Musa] Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad has stated that all member 
states of the Damascus Declaration have condemned the Iraqi 
invasion and contributed to the liberation of Kuwait. There is 
nothing new to be discussed on this matter because we believe 
that the Damascus Declaration member states stood united against 
the Iraqi aggression against Kuwait. [passage omitted] 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Regarding the development of areas that will 
come under Palestinian self-rule, is Kuwait willing to 
contribute to this development? 
  [Al-Musa] If you mean the self-rule areas, we have announced 
that Kuwait has contributed $25 million that will be spent 
through international organizations and economic institutions to 
develop the self-rule area and the occupied territories in 
general. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] What is your stance on the Arab boycott of 
Israel? It is being said that some Arab countries intend to end 
this boycott should a new situation arise. What is Kuwait's 
stance on this issue? 
  [Al-Musa] We in Kuwait are committed to the boycott as long 
as all the Arab countries are. There will be no separate or 
unilateral stance departing from the consensus of our Arab 
brothers. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Beirut, Jan 7 (AFP)--The Arab Organisation of Human 
Rights accused Libya Friday [7 January] of kidnapping an 
opposition leader in Cairo last month and urged Egypt to pursue 
its efforts to determine the Libyan's fate. 
  The organisation, which held an extraordinary meeting in 
Beirut this week, said the Libyan authorities were most probably 
behind the abduction of Mansur al-Kikhya who vanished on 
December 11 in the Egyptian capital where he was attending a 
conference of Arab human rights group. 
  The organisation invited Libya in a statement distributed to 
the press in the Lebanese capital to "counter these suspicions 
based on official Libyan declarations made around this date, 
calling for the elimination of the opposition and killing its 
leaders." 
  The head of the Arab human rights organisation, Adib 
al-Jadir, told AFP that al-Qadhdhafi made such statements on 
December 12. 
  Al-Kikhya, 63, served as foreign minister under Colonel 
Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi in the 1970s and represented Libya at the 
United Nations between 1976 and 1980. He later became the 
leader of the main opposition movement the National Rally. 
  The Libyan opposition has accused the Libyan government of 
kidnapping al-Kikhya. Tripoli denied any involvement in the 
affair, saying he was a victim of a feud between opposition 
groups. 
  Friday's statement also urged Egypt to "pursue its efforts 
to 
guarantee the return of Mr. al-Kikhya." 
  The human rights group is a Cairo-based non-governmental 
organisation, founded 10 years ago with members from all over 
the Arab world and offices in 15 Arab cities and six European 
capitals.

  [Text] Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa will leave Cairo for 
Damascus today to lead Egypt's delegation to meetings of the 
Damascus Declaration countries' foreign ministers. 
  Musa said the Damascus Declaration foreign ministers will 
discuss the situation in the Middle East in light of 
developments in the peace process and the tense situation in 
other areas of the region. 
  The conferees will also discuss economic cooperation in the 
Middle East, follow up on the declaration's contents, and hold 
consultations on various issues in the region. 
  Commenting on the Syrian-U.S. summit scheduled to be held in 
Geneva in mid-January, Musa said that Egypt believes that this 
summit is especially important because it concerns the 
Syrian-Israeli track, a primary track in the peace process. He 
added that the issue of land for peace will be discussed 
specifically and decisively at this summit, noting that the land 
in question is the Golan Heights, which was occupied in 1967. 
  The summit will also include a discussion on the concept of 
peace, making the meeting an important landmark in the peace 
process. Musa noted that the U.S. role is fundamental because 
the United States is the main sponsor of the peace process, 
which it launched in Madrid. 
  He said that this process is based on several guarantees and 
rules governed by the principle of land for peace, and therefore 
the U.S. role is fundamental. 
  Musa said Egypt attaches special importance to this summit 
and fully supports it. He added that President Husni Mubarak 
discussed this summit during his contacts with the various 
parties involved in the peace process.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 9 Jan (MENA)--At an expanded meeting with 
a number of ministers today, President Husni Mubarak discussed 
several important economic issues, primarily the GATT agreement 
and its impact on the Egyptian economy. This was revealed in a 
statement by Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif following a 
meeting that lasted more than two hours. The meeting was 
attended by Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi; Dr Kamal al-Janzuri, 
deputy prime minister and planning minister; Dr. Yusuf Wali, 
deputy prime minister and agriculture minister; and the social 
affairs minister, the information minister, the minister of 
public business sector, the finance minister, the education 
minister, the local administration minister, minister of state 
for population and family affairs, minister of state for the 
People's Assembly and Consultative Council affairs, the economy 
minister, health minister, minister of state for international 
cooperation; and Dr. Isma'il Hasan, governor of the Central 
Bank; and Dr. Zakariya 'Azmi, director of the President's Office. 
  Al-Sharif noted that President Mubarak heard a report on the 
GATT agreements that have so far been signed by 114 countries 
and represent 90 percent of the volume of international trade. 
He said that the economy minister pointed out that the GATT 
agreement involves three main areas: currencies, financing, and 
trade. Al-Sharif noted that the report touched on Egypt's 
membership in the agreements that were reached before the GATT 
agreement and the positive aspects that bolstered Egypt's 
national economy since these agreements were signed between 1970 
and 1991. The report stressed that the agreements which Egypt 
joined between 1970 and 1991 were reviewed by the cabinet and 
the constitutional establishments. The report explained the 
conflict in interests between the advanced nations and the 
developing countries and the negative impact of the GATT 
agreement on the economies of these countries in the short term 
and the positive aspects that may be gained in the medium and 
long terms. 
  Al-Sharif pointed out that President Mubarak discussed the 
export policy and the impact of the GATT agreement on Egypt's 
export policy and on the system of export shares and the effect 
of the gradual cancellation of the shares system, which the GATT 
agreement notes will be canceled over a 10-year period. The 
report notes the approval in the GATT agreement of Egypt's 
memorandum on protecting Egypt's clothing industry and stopping 
exports of ready-made clothing and textiles in the early stages 
of the implementation of the agreement. President Mubarak also 
discussed the impact of the gradual abrogation of subsidies on 
agricultural commodities over a six-year period and its effect 
on the prices of food and agricultural commodities. President 
Mubarak stressed that the economic policies must be based on 
enhancing the positive aspects and drawing up plans to confront 
the negative effects on the Egyptian economy in accordance with 
future economic policies in the short, medium, and long terms. 
He also called for assessing the effects of canceling subsidies 
on agricultural commodities during these six years by the 
producing and exporting countries and the effects of rising 
prices of the commodities that Egypt imports, such as wheat. He 
called for drawing up economic and financial policies to address 
these factors. 
  Mubarak called for increasing Egyptian exports to the Arab 
and African markets by removing obstacles and facilitating 
procedures for exports, particularly textiles, cotton, 
ready-made clothing, and other commodities. Al-Sharif noted 
that President Mubarak also discussed a report on the 
performance of the public business sector. [passage omitted]

begin in the second half of February. The president said: The 
situation in Egypt is much better when compared to other 
countries, especially as we implement economic reforms that we 
consider to be in the best interests of most of our citizens. 
  In an exclusive interview with MAYU, he said that the state 
is eager to protect national industry in every way. He urged 
Egypt's youth not to be misled by calls of perversion, no matter 
what the temptation. He also urged the Arab brothers to close 
the files of the past and look to the future in a spirit of 
optimism, solidarity, and cooperation.

  [Text] Cairo, 9 Jan (MENA)--Dr. Yusuf Wali, deputy prime 
minister and secretary general of the National Democratic Party 
[NDP], has announced that the party's bureau staff had met with 
eight opposition party leaders as part of the exchange of views 
on the national dialogue called for by President Husni Mubarak 
in his address to the joint meeting of the People's Assembly and 
Consultative Council. 
  In a speech to the NDP's political club last night, Dr. Wali 
said that the points of agreement with the opposition leaders 
were far greater than those of disagreement. He said the 
dialogue is a good initiative because it has enabled the 
opposition parties to comprehend the NDP's views. It has also 
enabled the party's bureau staff to understand the concepts of 
the opposition party leaders concerning the national dialogue 
issue. 
  Dr. Wali said that he will meet with the leaders of the 
Greens Party and the Democratic Unionist Party by the end of 
this week. Meanwhile, the NDP's bureau staff will meet with the 
officials in charge of AL-AHRAM's Strategic and Political 
Studies Center, which is exploring the various opinions about 
the national dialogue issue.

  [Text] Cairo, Jan 8 (AFP) -- Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood on 
Saturday [8 January] urged the government to start a dialogue 
with Islamic militant groups in a bid to end a two-year wave of 
violence. 
  "Before starting talks, both sides must pledge to abandon 
violence," according to Brotherhood spokesman Ma'mun al-Hudabi, 
whose group supports creating an Islamic state through peaceful 
means. 
  Prime Minister Atif Sidqi said Friday that a dialogue with 
"terrorists" would be "useless". 
  President Husni Mubarak, after he won a third term in office 
in October, called for "a national dialogue" on all the 
country's problems including religious extremism. 
  The Muslim Brotherhood, tolerated as a religious group but 
banned as a political movement, is also asking for "free and 
honest" elections. 
  The spokesman said his group should be legalized, although 
the Egyptian Constitution bans political parties based on 
religion or regional ideology. 
  Meanwhile, two men suspected of belonging to militant groups 
opened fire Friday on two policemen who tried to detain them for 
questioning in the southern town of Abu Tij, but the officers 
were unhurt. 
  This was the first such confrontation in the fundamentalist 
stronghold of Asyut this year. 
  The clandestine Al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah and al-Jihad stepped 
up their violent campaign for an Islamic state in March 1993, 
targeting government officials, policemen, tourists and Coptic 
Christians. 
  So far 272 people have been killed, including 95 policemen 
and 86 militants.

  [Text] Khartoum, 8 Jan (MENA)--Sudanese leader Lieutenant 
General 'Umar al-Bashir has stressed the need to prepare for and 
remove obstacles to holding an Arab summit. 
  In a statement to the MENA correspondent in Khartoum, 
al-Bashir said: Our Arab ties are inclined toward 
reconciliation with those who are hostile to us because we 
believe that reconciliation among the Arabs is the peoples' 
desire. We will continue our efforts to achieve this goal in 
the near future, if not today. 
  He added: Everyone in the Arab region now feels that the 
current discord has weakened the Arab stance on the Arab 
nation's causes. We have noticed that the Arabs are absent in 
many international arenas and in the situations that require 
cooperation and coordination. 
  For his part, Sudanese Foreign Minister Husayn Abu-Salih has 
said that his country supports all efforts to achieve Arab 
reconciliation and all initiatives to restore Arab solidarity. 
  In a statement to the MENA Khartoum correspondent, he added: 
We have already declared our support for the initiatives of 
United Arab Emirates President Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al 
Nuhayyan, Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id of Oman, and Arab League 
Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid. 
  He noted that the current regional and world challenges make 
Sudan more insistent on collective and bilateral action to 
achieve Arab reconciliation. This reconciliation, he said, has 
become a historic responsibility that requires everyone to 
accomplish it in line with the aspirations of the Arab nations 
who are fed up with the current divisions. 
  Abu-Salih says: Arab reconciliation and the restoration of 
Arab unity are the goals we are trying to accomplish, and this 
proves our sincere desire to improve the current situation. We 
are doing all we can to achieve reconciliation, and we will be 
the first to support an Arab summit to achieve solidarity and 
rally all efforts to confront the current world and regional 
dangers that threaten the Arab nations. 
  He asserted the need for a suitable atmosphere to achieve an 
inter-Arab political detente and to prepare properly for an Arab 
summit. He remarked that the bases on which such reconciliation 
relies are stipulated in the Arab League charter, which we all 
respect. 
  Dr. Mustafa 'Uthman Isma'il, Sudanese minister of state and 
secretary of the popular international friendship council [name 
and title as received], says achieving Arab reconciliation is 
one of the fundamental bases of Sudan's foreign policy. This 
policy's aim, he adds, is to eliminate all causes of division 
and dispute because Arab solidarity will stop the current 
disorder. 
  He believes that the current developments in the Arab world, 
Israel's attempts at hegemony and expansion, the deadlock in the 
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, and pan-Arab security problems 
such as the water and border problems require an urgent Arab 
summit. He said that to be successful this summit needs 
favorable circumstances by removing current tensions and 
disputes. He expressed his belief that if the current intense 
reconciliation efforts are boosted, they will pave the way for a 
summit. 
  The Sudanese minister of state believes that the Arab League 
should move in various ways to make the Gulf Cooperation Council 
issue a resolution calling for such a summit. He notes that the 
Arab League can also seek other resolutions from the Arab 
Maghreb Union and from countries outside these two councils. 
Then the Arab League should meet at the foreign ministers level 
to discuss proposals and means for the summit. 
  He says that reconciliations between countries with various 
disputes could be achieved before the summit, which would 
consolidate these efforts, and other topics could be discussed. 
  He affirmed that the summit is necessary and desirable even 
if it achieves nothing because it will break the psychological 
barrier caused by the Gulf war and because failing to hold such 
a summit will encourage others to interfere in Arab affairs and 
will weaken Arab efforts to restore solidarity. 
  The Sudanese minister of state pointed out that the general 
Arab trend is positive and inclined toward reconciliation. He 
noted that past reconciliation efforts have resulted in easing 
tension, as was the case in Palestinian-Saudi relations when 
Faysal al-Husayni in his capacity as head of the Palestinian 
Steering Committee in the peace talks visited Riyadh; the start 
of a dialogue between Yemen and Saudi Arabia; and the 
improvement of Sudan's relations with some of the Gulf states, 
including Qatar and Oman. He said: I believe that the efforts 
of the Arab League and its secretary general will help end the 
current differences, although these efforts might take some time 
to reach a strategic situation where the Arab countries will 
form a single economic, military, and social bloc. 
  He added that Egypt's role is crucial in holding the summit, 
because as chairman of the Arab League and the OAU and with its 
influence it can help expedite the efforts to hold an Arab 
summit. 
  For his part, Muhammad Shakir al-Siraj, chairman of the 
Foreign Relations Committee of the Sudanese Transitional 
National Council, the parliament, asserts that restoration of 
Arab solidarity is a fundamental requirement to ward off the 
dangers that threaten the Arab world and the suffering of the 
Iraqi, Libyan, and Sudanese peoples. 
  Al-Siraj expressed his belief that Arab leaders are able to 
restore solidarity and that after more than three years since 
the outbreak of the Gulf war, disputes that resulted from that 
war should disappear. He hopes the Arab leaders will be able to 
hold a summit this year.

  [Text] Kampala, Jan 9 (AFP) -- Heavy fighting has erupted 
between Sudanese rebels and government troops near the southern 
town of Kaya, rebel sources said here Sunday [9 January]. 
  An official of the mainstream Sudan People's Liberation Army 
(SPLA) who asked not to be named said fighting broke out early 
last week in areas east of Kaya, close to the Ugandan border. 
  Rebels have since killed 28 goverment soldiers, he claimed, 
but refused to give rebel casualty figures. 
  An SPLA spokesman in Nairobi, Justin Arop, confirmed that 
fighting was raging. 
  Arop gave other regions where fighting was also going on as 
Bor, Yei, Morobo, areas between the southern Sudan regional 
capital of Juba and Kit, and along the railway line in the Bahr 
al Ghazal Province. 
  Ugandan officials said the fresh fighting had triggered a 
new 
influx of refugees into northern Uganda. 
  An estimated 3,000 Sudanese were arriving in the region 
every 
week, Ugandan deputy minister for local government Steven 
Chebrot said. 
  Uganda has a Sudanese refugee population of 200,000. Some 
70,000 of them have arrived in the past five months. 
  The SPLA has waged a decade-long war against the Khartoum 
government to free the mainly animist and Christian southern 
Sudan from domination by the Moslem, Arabised north.

  [Text] So far nothing has permitted the holding of a 
referendum on self-determination in Western Sahara in accordance 
with the UN peace plan. If efforts have failed or have not been 
made in this connection, the town of Layoune in Western Sahara 
has been a focus of attention in recent days. The Saudi 
interior minister is currently in Layoune, which was visited 
recently by his French counterpart. This has aroused the anger 
of the Polisario [Popular Front for the Liberation of Saquia El 
Hamra and Rio de Oro]. Our correspondent Mourad has the details: 
  [Mourad] Polisario yesterday expressed its surprise and 
displeasure at the visit of Charles Pasqua to Layoune two days 
ago. In a communique the Front describes the French interior 
minister's visit to be blatantly at variance with the 
responsibility of France as a permanent member of the UN 
Security Council. Nothing has filtered out about the Pasqua 
visit, which coincided with the presence of Saudi Interior 
Minister Prince Nayif Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz in Layoune. The senior 
Saudi official has been in Layoune on a private visit since last 
Thursday, according to MAP. 
  The situation in Western Sahara remains generally tense, as 
admitted by special UN representative Yaqub Khan, who has 
further said that he is making efforts to resolve the Saharan 
problem. The special UN representative made this statement 
after meeting President Maaouya Ould Sid Ahmed Taya of 
Mauritania in Nouakchott yesterday. 
  It should be mentioned that the UN peace plan for a 
referendum in Western Sahara is obstructed by a disagreement 
between Morocco and Polisario, the conflicting parties, over the 
number of voters.

  [Text] The Popular Front for the Liberation of Saquia El 
Hamra and Rio de Oro [Polisario] obviously did not expect the 
visit of French Interior Minister Charles Pasqua to Layoune, 
capital of Western Sahara, on Friday. In a communique released 
last night, Saharawi leaders made no secret of the fact that 
they were surprised. Jerome Bastion reports: 
  [Bastion] Twenty-four hours after Charles Pasqua's brief 
visit to Layoune, the Polisario Front in Algiers expressed the 
surprise and the total dismay of the Saharawi people regarding 
this most serious gesture. According to the communique, this 
first visit by a leading foreign official to Western Sahara is 
in blatant contradiction with the responsibility of France, a 
member of the UN Security Council. 
  France recently offered its good offices to set up a direct 
meeting in Paris between Moroccans and Saharawis, after 
Polisario leaders had criticized France's wait-and-see policy in 
connection with the settlement of the conflict in Western 
Sahara. The visit by the French interior minister, although 
unofficial, has thus caused frustration and disappointment, I 
quote, among the Saharawis, all the more so because it was to be 
followed by that of his Saudi counterpart. 
  At the same time, the UN representative for Western Sahara, 
Yaqub Ali Kahn, is touring the region. He is visiting the 
refugee camps of Tindouf today. He said yesterday in 
Nouakchott, in Mauritania: The issue of the Sahara is in a 
critical state. 
  The referendum on self-determination was to take place at 
the 
end of 1993 under the aegis of the UN. The UN secretary general 
has just announced that it could be organized next June. The 
issue is still in deadlock. It was to be at the core of the 
talks which took place yesterday between the Algerian foreign 
minister and Saharawi President Mohamed Abdelaziz together with 
his minister of defense and of foreign affairs.

  [Text] In Afghanistan, after seven days of intense 
fighting, the cease-fire agreed between the rival factions is 
holding. Thousands of people are fleeing the capital, Kabul. 
The truce came into effect at 0600 today. The cease-fire 
appeal was made by Pakistan to evacuate diplomats, aid workers, 
and the wounded to safer places. Pakistan had urged the warring 
factions to start negotiations for resolving the present crisis. 
A convoy of about 70 vehicles carrying foreign nationals and 
diplomats has left Kabul. Thursday's bombardment has caused 
extensive damage in the center of the city. Markets and shops 
are ablaze and the streets are littered with debris. 
  Pakistan has offered to use its good offices to end the 
fighting. According to informed sources, Iran, Turkey, Libya, 
and China have asked Pakistan to take the first step and try to 
convince the warring factions for a complete cease-fire. Iran 
and Saudi Arabia will later join these efforts to bring normalcy 
in the war-torn country.

  [Text] Kabul, Jan 9 (AFP) -- Fresh fighting erupted in 
Kabul Sunday ending a 30-hour ceasefire. 
  Two people were killed in Microryan district, the scene of 
some of the worst fighting last week, sources said, while others 
reported that fighting also resumed around noon Sunday (0730 
GMT) in Kabul's volatile southeastern districts. 
  The fresh fighting ended an exodus of civilians from the 
capital who had been taking advantage of a 24-hour ceasefire 
which officially expired at 6.00 a.m. but had held for several 
more hours, sources said. 
  It also came as some 65 diplomats, United Nations personnel 
and some foreign nationals reached the northwestern Pakistani 
city of Peshawar from Kabul. 
  The diplomats include Iranians, Libyans, Indians, Turkish, 
Somalians and Palestinians who temporarily closed their missions 
in the Afghan capital.

  [Text] Islamabad -- The Afghan government is claiming that 
fighting in Kabul, which entered its seventh day on Friday, was 
prompted by a thwarted plot to oust President Borhanoddin 
Rabbani. 
  Government sources claimed that Rabbani's arch rival Prime 
Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, aided by powerful militia leader 
Gen Rashid Dostam, a close Rabbani ally until last Saturday, and 
the Wahdat militia had planned to move their joint forces into 
the city to capture the Presidential Palace. 
  The government said opposition, who apparently gained an 
edge 
when Dostam switched loyalties and attacked government forces, 
had hoped to replace Rabbani with Sebghatollah Mojaddedi. 
  The government alleged the plot called for elevating Dostam, 
a former communist general, to be defence minister while 
Hekmatyar would remain prime minister. 
  Asked to comment on the government claim, the spokesman for 
Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan], Haji Mangal 
Hussain, said: "We have been openly asking that Rabbani must 
step down. If he does so, Hekmatyar will also resign." 
  Opposition and government sources said fighting, which 
showed 
Thursday night, resumed early Friday with both sides trading 
heavy artillery and rocket fire. 
  However, heavy snow and fog prevented either side from using 
aircraft to stage attacks. 
  Dostam, the only non-governmental commandar to have an air 
force, has been using his planes to bomb government positions in 
and around Kabul. 
  He claimed on Thursday to have gained complete control of 
the 
northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif. 
  The continued fighting has prompted Pakistan, Iran and the 
UN 
Secretary General's representative in Afghanistan to call for a 
ceasefire and peace. Islamabad had called for a 24 hour 
ceasefire, to begin at 2300 PST [Pakistan Standard Time], to 
permit the wounded, diplomats and UN personnel to be evacuated 
form Kabul. 
  "Pakistan is deeply concerned over the increase in serial 
bombardment posing a great danger to the civilians living in 
Kabul, and has urged all sides to hold political talks", the 
spokesman said. 
  Opposition sources in Peshawar said Rabbani has sent his 
family to Pakistan.

  [Text] Led by brother Hekmatyar, the country's prime 
minister, the Friday prayer has been said with participation of 
many noble and muslim people of the Charasiab district in Kabul 
Province, officials of Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of 
Afghanistan], jehadi commanders, and mojahedin, in the grand 
mosque of the temporary headquarters of the premiership. A 
correspondent of Message of Freedom Radio and Television reports 
that in the first sermon of the Friday prayer brother Hekmatyar 
delivered a comprehensive speech. 
  In a section of the speech he said: [words indistinct] There 
should have been a government in Kabul but there is no 
administration nor government. Over the past 20 months there 
has been no security even around the Arg [presidential palace] 
nor were the property, dignity, and life of the people safe. 
Brother Hekmatyar added: Unfortunately the other side has 
opted for the path of force, deception, and broken promises. A 
ceasefire came to force in Tagab, but they started fighting in 
Kabul a short time after that. For [words indistinct] we 
proposed a plan but the other side rejected it. They wanted 
[word indistinct] or Khiarkhan [a district northwest of Kabul] 
government to continue. Tagab blood had not yet dried up when 
they started more bloody fighting in Kabul. 
  The prime minister said: [words indistinct] every force and 
mojahedin who believes in God and pities the nation shall take 
each other's hands and take steps for a final action. God 
willing the present fighting is the final battle which will 
resolve the crisis of the country. Concluding his speech 
brother Hekmatyar said: All those equations which ensured the 
chance of the coalition's survival have been disrupted.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] As the date for the Syrian-U.S. Geneva summit 
approaches, political contacts and moves are increasing. U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher said that the United 
States attaches great importance to the meeting between 
Presidents al-Asad and Clinton due to Syria's basic role in the 
peace process and to the expected results of the meeting in 
terms of pushing the Middle East peace process forward. 
  The Americans, in general, think it likely there will be 
substantive progress after the summit. However, we do not want 
to prejudge things or express excessive optimism due to Israel's 
history of destroying peace opportunities and creating 
obstacles. Progress in the peace process ultimately hinges on a 
change in the Israeli policy toward implementing UN Security 
Council resolutions and recognizing the formula of a just and 
comprehensive peace in the region. No one sensed this so far. 
Moreover, observers agree that Israel will not submit to the 
resolutions of international legitimacy and will not put aside 
the policy of prevarication and procrastination without an 
effective and decisive U.S. role that puts an end to Israel's 
evasion of these resolutions. 
  Syria has dealt with the issue of peace in the Middle East 
with absolute sincerity and positiveness. Syria's contribution 
has been effective and fruitful, as the world, including the 
United States, attests. Syria facilitated the convocation of 
the Madrid conference when Israel closed all doors. And since 
the sixth round of talks, Syria has presented constructive and 
balanced proposals. Syria also twice helped the United States 
save the peace process from collapse. The first time was when 
Rabin's government sent large forces to southern Lebanon and 
committed a wicked barbarian aggression that led to the 
displacement of hundreds of thousands of Lebanese civilians. 
The second time was when the Washington talks were halted as a 
result of the separate deal in Oslo and when Israel overtly 
declared that it is not concerned with the Syrian and Lebanese 
tracks, thus obstructing the peace talks in Washington. 
  The Oslo deal reveals an ambiguous and incomplete agreement, 
for which its two sides; that is, the Palestinian and Israeli 
sides, have conflicting interpretations. This agreement was 
rejected by the Palestinian people in the occupied territories 
and the diaspora since it contradicts the Security Council 
resolutions and does not meet the minimum level of rights and 
ambitions. It was not to be nice that Warren Christopher 
visited the region and held lengthy talks with President Hafiz 
al-Asad in Damascus; talks that were crowned by the arrangement 
of a summit in Geneva. 
  The United Stated realizes that separate deals cannot 
achieve 
peace and that there is no alternative to returning to the 
basics of the Madrid conference, the Security Council 
resolutions, and the formula for a just and comprehensive peace 
which Syria continues to call for. 
  Out of the above comes this not-so-optimistic outlook 
expressed by Damascus and other Arab capitals. The United 
States' reaffirmation of the formula of a just and comprehensive 
peace and of the need to implement Security Council resolutions 
is a positive factor that helps put the peace process on the 
right and beneficial track. However, one must not forget that 
Israel has a long record of striking at the peace opportunities, 
aborting the peace efforts, and containing the U.S. stands. 
  It is no coincidence that Israeli officials expect the 
situation to heat up in southern Lebanon on the eve of the 
Syrian-U.S. summit. In most cases, Israel has resorted to 
escalation whenever there are signs of real progress. 
Throughout the past, Israel sought to diminish Syria's role, 
cast doubts on Lebanon's effectiveness, and convince the United 
States to concentrate its efforts on the Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
However, the events revealed to the public that only a just and 
comprehensive peace can save the Middle East from the whirlpool 
of conflicts and wars and that separate deals do not lead to 
peace but add more to the serious tension in the region. 
  President Clinton, who will begin a tour of Russia and many 
European countries today, will surely listen to statements that 
will reinforce the United States' conviction of the need to 
achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East based 
on Security Council resolutions and the land-for-peace 
principle. President Clinton will find out that President 
al-Asad is completely willing to push the peace process forward 
and achieve tangible results based on Security Council 
resolutions. Syria is eager to achieve peace inasmuch as it is 
eager to restore its territories and end the Israeli occupation 
of all Arab territories. Peace is synonymous with justice. 
Justice stipulates the removal of the Israeli occupation so 
every party can restore its rights.

  [Text] Gentlemen: A few days before the anticipated 
summit meeting between President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton, eyes are directed toward Geneva in 
anticipation of results that might prove decisive in the Middle 
East peace process that has been stumbling for over two years. 
While the world looks to this summit and its outcome with hope 
and confidence, only Israel seems to hope that the Geneva summit 
will not achieve any results that might advance the peace 
process. 
  Israel, which was forced to join the peace process under 
international pressure and did so with the hope of disrupting it 
from within, does not wish the summit success because such 
success will undoubtedly reflect positively on the peace process 
and give a strong push toward the establishment of a just and 
comprehensive peace based on the resolutions of international 
legitimacy and the land-for-peace principle. It is only natural 
to expect that Israel might do anything in order to confuse the 
picture and sabotage the expected results of the summit in 
advance. 
  The Tel Aviv rulers, who tried to delude the world into 
believing, after the Gaza-Jericho agreement, that peace has been 
established in the Middle East, are only seeking to strike 
separate and partial deals and avoid a comprehensive solution as 
stipulated by the initiative undertaken by the two cosponsors 
and on whose basis the Madrid conference was held. Israel's 
adherence to partial solutions, its continued occupation of Arab 
territories, and its establishment of settlements on these 
territories are considered obstacles hampering the peace process 
and preventing any progress in talks. 
  The international community, led by the American sponsor, 
stressed the need to find a comprehensive solution and noted 
that settlements are an obstacle to peace. It also welcomed 
Syria's position and the paper it presented during the sixth 
round of Washington's bilateral talks, considering it an 
objective paper based on the relevant resolutions of 
international legitimacy and the land-for-peace principle. 
Nevertheless, Israel stood against the resolutions of 
international legitimacy and evaded the Madrid formula and work 
for a comprehensive solution. It publicly states that it will 
not withdraw from the Arab territories it occupies and that it 
is ready for a withdrawal in the Golan and not from the Golan. 
All this clearly indicates that Israel is not serious in its 
quest for peace. One who wants peace should unequivocally 
announce his readiness to restore rights to their owners and to 
withdraw from the occupied Arab territories. It is neither 
reasonable nor logical for Israel to ask for land and peace 
together because no one in the world would approve of this. 
  Syria and the Arabs are not ready to cede an inch of the 
occupied Syrian Golan or any usurped Arab right. There is no 
doubt that the U.S. Administration is fully aware of the Syrian 
position, which is based on the principles of history, 
geography, right, and justice. U.S. President Bill Clinton may 
have something new to energize the peace process on the basis of 
Resolutions 242 and 338 and the principle of land for peace. 
Syria is ready to listen to the ideas of the U.S. President and 
his convictions, but not on the basis of ceding what we struggle 
for and believe in. The anticipated Syrian- American summit is 
an historic opportunity to advance the peace process. Upon his 
meeting with President Hafiz al-Asad, President Clinton will be 
reassured about Syria's desire for a just and comprehensive 
peace to which the region's peoples aspire. He will also make 
sure of the Syrian desire to open all avenues leading to this 
peace. What remains to be seen is the actions of the U.S. 
Administration, which declared itself a fair and honest partner 
in the peace process, toward the party that placed hurdles and 
set ambushes along the path of peace. Only then can one talk 
about a new and serious trend toward establishing the aspired 
peace in the Middle East.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said today that the 
implementation of the Declaration of Principles [DOP] with the 
Palestinians depends on the attainment of an agreement in Taba. 
Rabin reiterated that there are no sacred dates, and that the 
basis for the target dates is the attainment of an agreement. 
Our correspondent Yiftah El'azar reports: 
  [Begin recording] [El'azar] One would be well advised not 
to expect a breakthrough in the Taba talks in the next few days, 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin stated today. Warning against 
disappointment, Rabin said that if there is no basis for the 
continuation of the dialogue with the Palestinians the sides 
might reach the conclusion that there is nothing to talk about. 
The prime minister was asked whether Israel would comply with 
the target date set for the completion of the withdrawal from 
Gaza and Jericho, and he replied that the target date depends on 
an agreement being signed in Taba. 
  [Rabin] I reiterate: There are no sacred dates. The DOP 
mentions phases and target dates, but the basis for these target 
dates is the ability to attain an agreement. [Later on in the 
program, Rabin is quoted as saying that he would rather "not 
renew the peace talks with the PLO in Washington, as long as the 
Israelis and the Palestinians do not reach an agreement in 
Taba."] 
  [El'azar] Rabin also referred to the security situation, in 
the wake of suspicions that the murder of a taxi driver in 
Herzliyya yesterday was committed for nationalistic motives. 
There are no signs of a rise in the number of terrorist 
attacks, the prime minister said, and the closure has so far 
proved itself. At the same time, he noted, we cannot defend 
ourselves from individuals who cross the Green Line to carry out 
terrorist attacks. 
  [Rabin] We have signs that some of the elements opposed to 
the agreement who pursue terror do not suffice with attacks on 
Israelis in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza but definitely want to 
penetrate Israel's sovereign territory. 
  [El'azar] One must bear in mind that the closure is not 
hermetical, Rabin said, vowing that the security forces would do 
their utmost to tighten security. [end recording]

evening that Israel has not changed its position regarding 
crossing procedures on the Jordan River bridges and the scope of 
the withdrawal in Jericho. Mr. Peres made these remarks on the 
eve of the resumption of the talks in Taba. In its weekly 
session today, the cabinet heard a briefing on the issue. Our 
political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports from the studio: 
  [Raz] [passage omitted] Israel is not prepared to change the 
Cairo understandings, either with regard to the crossing 
arrangements on the bridges or the scope of the withdrawal in 
Jericho. This position was unequivocally reaffirmed by Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres. 
  [Begin Peres recording] The Cairo understandings do not 
include 'Arafat's observations, that is as clear as day. As for 
the Cairo understandings, there is the document we issued and 
the observations of Nabil Sha'th -- and they do not differ all 
that much from each other -- and this should be the basis for 
discussion. [end recording] [passage omitted] 
  In anticipation of the meeting between Clinton and al-Asad, 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin remarked that if the Syrians link 
peace to the normalization of relations with Israel this would 
be a change. If al-Asad chooses to maintain the current 
vagueness, then nothing will have changed, the prime minister 
said.

  [Text] Israel will not withdraw from Gaza and Jericho on 
14 April, the date set in the Declaration of Principles [DOP] 
with the PLO. This may be inferred from the remarks of Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres, who said today that there is no target 
date for the withdrawal. Rather, he said, there is an 
understanding that the implementation of the DOP will last four 
months after the agreement has been signed. Peres was asked 
whether that meant that the withdrawal would start toward the 
beginning of summer, and he replied: We will try to do it 
earlier. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1300 GMT on 10 January 
quotes Peres as "voicing his confidence that progress will be 
made in the Taba talks and noting that the DOP cannot be 
implemented in one go."]

<F P=106> [Report by Nadav Shragay and Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Text] Shmu'el Me'ir, a deputy mayor of Jerusalem on behalf 
of the National Religious Party, says that he has learned about 
the existence of an informal Israeli-PLO committee that has 
already begun discussing the nature of the permanent arrangement 
in Jerusalem. 
  Me'ir says his remarks are based on reliable sources from 
within the system, whose "conscience is bothered by the 
end-of-season sale the Israeli Government is holding these days 
on properties including Jerusalem." Me'ir claims that the 
committee is drawing lines and maps that will demarcate those 
areas within the city's current jurisdiction that are 
indisputably Arab, and that those areas will be handed over to 
the Palestinians when the permanent settlement is implemented in 
the city. He claims that this category includes Arab 
neighborhoods, such as Shu'fat and 'Isawiyah, in which no Jews 
reside. 
  As stated, Me'ir refuses to disclose his sources, but he 
insists that these are trustworthy people who are unwilling to 
be accomplices in such a far-reaching move which, he believes, 
means partitioning the city. Me'ir is going to demand an urgent 
city council meeting. He plans to brief Jerusalem Mayor Ehud 
Olmert on the matter and to convey his information to ministers 
and Knesset members. 
  Reacting to Me'ir remarks, Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi 
Beilin said yesterday that they can be summed up by one word: 
`Nonsense.' 
  Me'ir further asserts that he has learned that in the 
recently signed Israel-Vatican agreement, Israel consented -- 
and this consent was not made public -- to granting 
extraterritorial status to Vatican churches and other Vatican 
properties in the city. 
  [In a live telephone interview by reporter Hayim Zissowitz 
on 
Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0505 GMT on 10 January, 
Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin says that Me'ir's remarks 
regarding extraterritorial status for Vatican properties are 
"sheer nonsense." Beilin adds that "nothing like that was ever 
agreed" and "the issue never came up." Asked whether Israel and 
the Vatican have signed an agreement on extraterritorial status, 
Beilin replies: "There is no such document, unless someone 
forged one."]

<F P=106> [Report by army affairs correspondent Roni Daniyel] </F>
  [Text] The defense establishment views the discontinuation 
of the peace talks as an indication of a struggle over 
negotiating modalities, and not merely details. For the defense 
establishment, the return to Taba means an understanding with 
the Palestinians that any agreements achieved there would be 
final, and that it will not be necessary to rush every agreement 
to Tunis for Yasir 'Arafat's approval or rejection. 
  The Taba talks will address the Qatif Bloc's area and 
defense 
mechanism; road traffic and how it is to be made secure; and 
that ancient issue of the control in border crossings, including 
that of Rafah. In all the talks, the Cairo understandings and 
agreements will be the starting line, nothing else. 
  If the Taba encounter proves successful both in terms of 
negotiating modalities and the Palestinian delegation's mandate, 
the civilian track will be launched in full scope in the coming 
days.

  [Text] Tzomet Knesset Member [MK] Eli'ezer Zandberg said he 
has documents from the Defense Ministry and the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] stating that the evacuation of Army forces from 
the Gaza Strip will begin on 22 February and take two days. 
Zandberg asserted that it is now clear that all the 
disagreements between Israel and the PLO were but a show that 
was intended to conceal information from the public. 
  In reaction, Meretz Knesset faction chairman Ran Kohen said 
that the documents disclosed by Zandberg were bogus. Kohen told 
our correspondent Hayim Hecht that he had checked with the IDF 
and the Defense Ministry and was informed that no date had been 
set for the start of the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, since 
the timetable for the evacuation process depended on the results 
of the negotiations with the Palestinians. This week a Knesset 
plenum will discuss a motion on the agenda presented by MK 
Zandberg on the issue of the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report, followed by Gil'ad 'Adin studio </F>
report] 
  [Text] The Defense Ministry has detailed plans for the 
Judaea and Samaria roads after the Palestinian autonomy is 
established. Our correspondent has learned that the Defense 
Ministry has prepared a map showing all the bypass roads that 
will be paved when the negotiations with the PLO end. Our 
correspondent Gil'ad 'Adin has the details: 
  The negotiations on the second stage of the implementation 
of 
the autonomy have not yet started, but a map of the autonomy 
roads is ready. The Defense Ministry defined the autonomy's 
areas considered dangerous and its presumed borders. The 
definitions were handed over to the Construction and Housing 
Ministry, and Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer instructed the 
Public Works Division [PWD] to prepare detailed plans for paving 
the new roads. 
  According to the map of the autonomy roads, 620 km of new 
roads will be paved. The work will be on an enormous scale, 
including bypass road for dangerous areas, safe access routes to 
the settlements in the territories, and roads along the autonomy 
borders which will serve those wishing to avoid the entire area. 
The new map was designed to be incorporated into the map of the 
peace roads, of which we reported some three months ago. That 
map provided a general plan for roads to the neighboring Arab 
countries, and not roads leading to specific settlements. The 
autonomy roads project will cost some 2 billion new Israeli 
shekels. It is not included in this year's PWD budget, which is 
why an additional budget is currently needed. 
  The Defense and the Construction and Housing Ministries are 
keeping the plan secret. We have learned that a detailed map 
has been prepared, and now it is clearer what the finance 
minister was referring to when he said, after the state budget 
was approved, that an additional budget will be required for 
plans connected with the establishment of the autonomy.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report, followed by Gil'ad 'Adin studio </F>
report] 
  [Excerpts] Construction and Housing Minister Binyamin 
Ben-Eli'ezer this evening confirmed that a detailed plan of 
bypass roads in the autonomy territories has been prepared for 
the Defense Ministry. Peace Now announced that if the 
government stops investing in the territories and direct the 
funds to other areas, it would correspond with the government's 
commitments. Our correspondent Gil'ad 'Adin has the details: 
  A grandiose, multiyear plan which would cost up to 2 billion 
new Israeli shekels, was how Construction and Housing Minister 
Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer this evening defined the autonomy road 
plan. According to him, the plan deals with paving bypass and 
shortcut roads, as well as works on reconstructing and expanding 
strategic roads. The purpose is to attain minimal friction 
between the Jewish and Arab residents of the autonomy area. 
  The details of the plan are being kept very secret. It is 
feared that if the road map is exposed, it would reveal the 
final intentions of the government before the negotiations on 
the second stage of autonomy have started. The Public Works 
Division [PWD] refused to confirm that it had prepared the map 
of the autonomy roads. A contingency plan exists for any 
eventuality, PWD sources told us, and we will be ready to begin 
work as soon as we are given the order by Minister Ben-Eli'ezer. 
[passage omitted] 
  The map was handed over to the Defense Ministry which, 
together with the Prime Minister's Office, is to decide on the 
order of priority for the various projects. If the entire plan 
is approved, it would cost some 2 billion shekel. In 
comparison, this is double the PWD budget for works throughout 
Israel in 1994.

  [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin said today that 
he expects President al-Asad to tell President Clinton that he 
intends to establish full peace with Israel. If Syria is 
willing to establish full diplomatic relations and open borders, 
Israel is willing to withdraw on the Golan -- not from the Golan 
-- following the formula that the depth of withdrawal equals the 
depth of peace. 
  Speaking to our correspondent, Deputy Minister Beilin said 
that an agreement has been reached with the Palestinians that 
the entire West Bank will be demilitarized with no Palestinian 
army or guns, and that Israel will militarily supervise the 
entire West Bank. At the same time, whether an Israeli military 
presence at every location in the West Bank is necessary still 
needs to be discussed.

  [Text] Professor Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to 
the United States and head of the Israeli team for negotiations 
with Syria, will come to Israel next week for consultations over 
the meeting between Presidents Clinton and al-Asad. Our 
political correspondent Gadi Sukenik reports that, after the 
meeting, Ambassador Rabinovich will hold a series of tete-a-tete 
meetings in Washington with the head of the Syrian delegation to 
the talks, Muwaffaq al-'Allaf. 
  In Israel, there are rising expectations for a positive 
shift 
in the negotiations with Syria following the Clinton-al-Asad 
summit. A senior political source, however, told our 
correspondent that the prime minister will have to slow down the 
pace of negotiations on the Golan Heights because, at this 
stage, he will be unable to deal simultaneously with 
negotiations with Syria and the Palestinians.

<F P=106> [Report by N'omi Levitsky] </F>
  [Excerpt] A decision in principle was made in Jerusalem a 
few days ago to evacuate the settlement of Netzarim. 
  Last night, a senior political source confirmed to YEDI'OT 
AHARONOT that the government intends to evacuate isolated 
settlements in the Gaza Strip. 
  The evacuation will be carried out unrelated to the 
negotiations being conducted with the PLO, and will be 
implemented within two to three months of the execution of the 
Gaza-Jericho First agreement. 
  Netzarim, a small and isolated settlement in the heart of 
the 
Gaza Strip, raises obstacles for those planning the redeployment 
of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] in the Gaza Strip. The most 
senior security sources advised Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to 
transplant the settlement inside the Qatif Bloc. Rabin, who 
made a commitment not to evacuate settlements within the 
framework of the negotiations with the PLO, refused to order the 
uprooting at this stage. 
  Senior defense elements made it clear to the prime minister 
that leaving the settlement where it is might in the future 
constitute a security danger and a recipe for needless friction 
with the Palestinians. The elements also warned that there is 
no possibility of defending the settlement. 
  According to the political source who confirmed the report, 
Rabin agreed in principle to evacuate Netzarim at a later stage 
and unlinked to the current negotiations with the PLO. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 9 January adds 
that Minister Yosi Sarid this morning responded to the report by 
saying that "no such decision was made in Jerusalem, it is 
currently not on the agenda, and especially not during the 
negotiations on implementing the Gaza-Jericho First agreement. 
Nevertheless, it seems that when the issue is brought up in the 
cabinet, and it is due to be raised in the coming months, many 
-- such as Minister Shulamit Aloni -- will support uprooting 
Netzarim." In a recorded passage, Minister Aloni is quoted as 
saying: "There are decisions we have put off making, which I 
think is a mistake. I think Netzarim should have been uprooted, 
there is no justification for it being situated in the heart of 
Gaza if we want to return Gaza." Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres 
also raised the issue in the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense 
Committee last week. He said Israel would study the cost of 
defending Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip located far from 
the Qatif Bloc.]

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Shlomo Raz] </F>
  [Text] The cabinet meeting has ended. Major General Dani 
Rothschild, coordinator of government activities in the 
territories, presented the ministers with a gloomy report on the 
territories. The economic situation there is deteriorating, Arab 
laborers are not being employed within the Green Line, there are 
difficulties in exporting agricultural produce, and the promises 
to send funds to the territories have not been met. The clear 
outcome of all this is an erosion of support for the Israeli-PLO 
agreement. We must remind you that the Taba talks resume 
tomorrow against that gloomy background, and they will be 
extensive, at least according to Minister Yosi Sarid: 
  [Begin Sarid recording] I heard optimistic evaluations by 
PLO spokesmen about the talks lasting two or three weeks. I 
would gladly join in their optimism, but knowing all the 
problems from close up, I am not so sure that we are talking 
about two or three weeks. I would be very pleased if that 
happens, but I believe that six to eight weeks is more 
reasonable. If I am proved wrong, I will be the first to be 
pleased. [end recording] 
  Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer hopes an agreement will be 
reached in Taba. 
  [Begin Ben-Eli'ezer recording] The message that emerges from 
the cabinet meeting is that we welcome the resumption of the 
talks, and hope with all our hearts that this time the 
Palestinians will realize that time is critical and that Israel 
is not prepared to give up one iota on security-related issues. 
At the same time, however, we want to enter into talks which 
will lead to the implementation of the agreement. [end 
recording] 
  We should recall the remarks made by Foreign Minister 
Shim'on 
Peres a week ago. He said that Israel will not bank on the 
issues on which agreement was reached in Cairo -- the scope of 
the withdrawal in Jericho and the procedures for border 
crossings at the bridges. 
  Shim'on Shetrit referred to the bazaar atmosphere that 
characterizes the negotiations and makes progress very 
difficult. He said the Palestinians do not understand that a 
handshake and oral agreements are binding. 
  [Begin Shetrit recording] In the future, I hope that those 
who conduct the negotiations will understand that we are dealing 
with an eastern bazaar, in which the other side tries to extract 
as much as possible all the time. Second, in reference to the 
formal procedure of approval by the other side, we need Yasir 
'Arafat's signature on the document, otherwise he will say it is 
not binding. [end recording] 
  To return to Minister Sarid, who referred to the reports 
about an intention to uproot settlements, and specifically the 
plan to uproot Netzarim. 
  [Begin Sarid recording] I do not know what will happen in 
the future, but I know -- and say so in the most authoritative 
way -- that in the current Jericho-Gaza First negotiations there 
is no talk about transferring or uprooting settlements. 
Therefore, any report that says otherwise is baseless. [end 
recording] 
  In other words, the government plans to leave Netzarim where 
it is at this stage. 
  Something else raised in the cabinet meeting were trips to 
China, which has become the most attractive destination for 
ministers. Foreign Minister Peres criticized his colleagues for 
going there en masse. Those who have so far been there are 
Rabin, Peres, and Ben-Eli'ezer, while those planning to go are 
Mikha Harish, Avraham Shohat, and Shim'on Shetrit. We will wait 
and see if Peres' call works.

  [Text] A terrorist attack was foiled today in the local 
police station in Ramallah. A young Arab woman from Kafr 'Aqab 
in the Ramallah District entered the station, pulled out a gun, 
and aimed it at a policeman. When a security officer pointed 
his gun at her, she let go of her weapon. She was detained for 
interrogation by the Judaea District police. 
  A booby-trapped car was identified and safely defused today 
in Jerusalem's French Hill. 
  An aide of the leader of the military wing of Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] in Judaea and Samaria was today sentenced 
by the Nabulus military court to seven years in prison. He had 
planned to detonate a car bomb in East Jerusalem.

  [Excerpts] Betzelem, the Israeli human rights 
organization, has called on the Palestinian political 
organizations to put an immediate stop to the torture and 
killing of residents suspected of cooperating with Israeli 
authorities. At the same time, at a news conference in 
Jerusalem this morning, the organization criticized Israel's 
deliberate recruitment of collaborators. Details from reporter 
Mark Weiss: 
  At almost every Betzelem news conference over the years, the 
organization has been accused of avoiding the issue of 
collaborator killings while concentrating exclusively on human 
rights abuses committed by the Israeli authorities. Yuval 
Ginbar from Betzelem denies the accusation. [passage omitted] 
  Between 750 and 950 Palestinians suspected of collaboration 
have been killed since the start of the intifadah, many after 
suffering severe torture. Both Israeli and Palestinian sources 
estimate that more that half of the Palestinians killed as 
collaborators did not in fact work for the authorities. 
According to a sample investigation conducted by Betzelem, many 
of those called collaborators had committed so-called social or 
criminal offenses, such as drug-trafficking or homosexuality. 
Many suspected collaborators were killed without any prior 
interrogation or judicial proceeding. 
  Betzelem considers the Palestinian political organizations, 
whose activists torture and kill, as responsible for these gross 
violations of human rights, along with the perpetrators 
themselves. The organization calls on the Palestinian political 
organizations to put an immediate stop to the torture and 
killing of suspected collaborators, to sever all financial and 
organizational ties to groups that commit such acts, and to 
place suspected perpetrators on trial. 
  Betzelem also criticizes the Israeli Government for 
flaunting 
international law, for what it terms the exploitation and 
extortion tactics employed to recruit collaborators. The 
recruitment of agents from the occupied territories by these 
methods is prohibited under the Fourth Geneva Convention. 
Betzelem calls on the Israeli Government to end the recruitment 
of collaborators, to stop using collaborators in illegal actions 
such as violent interrogations, and to enforce the law equally 
against collaborators who use violence or commit other criminal 
acts.

  [Text] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has commented on 
the Betzelem report about Arabs cooperating with the authorities 
in the territories. It says this is the first time that 
Betzelem has focused on the activities of Arab terrorist 
organizations vis-a-vis the internal Arab population. During 
the intifadah, the IDF says, most of the 964 Palestinians 
murdered by other Palestinians did not cooperate in any way with 
the IDF. The Army stressed its obligation to do everything 
required to support those individuals who have aided the Israeli 
authorities over the years.

<F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben and Tzvi Zrahya] </F>
  [Excerpt] The cabinet decided yesterday that Israel will 
hold the United States responsible for the cancellation of the 
VOA relay station project in the 'Arava and the commitments 
arising from it. Israel will demand U.S. compensation for 
expenditures caused by the project cancellation and expects the 
United States to be accountable for the financial commitments of 
the IBS [not further identified] conglomerate, which was 
responsible for establishing the relay station. 
  The cabinet resolution states that Israel has received the 
U.S. Government's announcement "concerning its request to cancel 
by mutual consent the 18 June 1987 agreement between the two 
governments for the establishment of a VOA station in the 
'Arava. The Government of Israel will not oppose the request in 
principle, but in view of the incurred expenses and commitments, 
the two governments should negotiate an agreement on the 
cancellation." 
  The cabinet has been advised that cancelling the project may 
generate lawsuits amounting to tens of millions of dollars by 
companies that had been slated to build the station, most 
notably Elbit. There is also the possibility that the U.S. 
Administration will demand a refund of their $16 million 
investment in the 'Arava made upon the signing of the station 
agreement. 
  The cabinet decided to appoint an interministerial team to 
draft the agreement and negotiate with the Americans. The team 
will be headed by Brigadier General Re'uven Yardor (Reserves), 
former project director for the Communications Ministry. The 
team will be be made up of representatives of the Foreign, 
Finance, Industry and Trade, and Justice Ministries. [passage

  [Text] A U.S. Congressional delegation gathering 
information on Israeli soldiers who went missing in Lebanon 12 
years ago arrived in al-Biqa' today. Senior Lebanese Army 
intelligence officers and a high-ranking U.S. diplomat received 
the delegation at al-Masna' on the Lebanese-Syrian border. 
  The delegation began its mission with a visit to 'Ayta 
al-Fakhkhar, where it met the mayor and the parish priest. The 
delegation visited the town's cemetery and took a sample of 
bones. 
  At 1315, the delegation left for al-Sultan Ya'qub for a 
meeting with some of the town's inhabitants. The delegation 
seeks to gather information about the fate of missing Israeli 
soldiers in Lebanon. 
  Hizballah's Consultative Council member Nabil Qawuq today 
held a news conference in which he called for the release of all 
the Lebanese, Palestinian, and Arab detainees in Israel in 
return for the release of an Israeli soldier held by Hizballah. 
He reiterated Hizballah's refusal to negotiate with the U.S. 
Congressional delegation.

  [Excerpts] A U.S. Congressional delegation today made a 
tour of al-Biqa' as part of its quest for information on Israeli 
soldiers imprisoned or missing in Lebanon. The team met with a 
number of Lebanese and Syrian officers in al-Biqa'. During the 
tour, the team was accompanied by six military vehicles carrying 
special units from the Lebanese Army as well as an armored 
vehicle that belongs to a U.S. security team. 
  Shaykh Nabil Qawuq, Hizballah Consultative Council member, 
held a news conference in Sidon in which he called for the 
release of all Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners held in Israel 
in exchange for releasing two [as heard] Israeli soldiers 
captured by Hizballah. Shaykh Qawuq denied that Israeli pilot 
Ron Arad is being held by Hizballah, adding that knowing his 
fate is a matter that concerns Israel. He also denied any 
direct contacts between Hizballah and the U.S. Congress. He 
noted that the United States is a full partner with Israel and 
therefore cannot act as a mediator. [passage omitted] 
  According to the latest reports, the U.S. team concluded its 
visit to al-Biqa' at 1500 today and left for Syria. The team is 
supposed to hold a news conference in Damascus to announce the 
results of its visit to Lebanon.

  [Text] The follow-up committee in support of Lebanese 
detainees in the Zionist enemy's prisons has denounced the visit 
of a U.S. Congressional delegation to discuss the fate of 
missing Israeli soldiers while it ignores the fate of hundreds 
of Lebanese detainees in al-Khiyam prison [in Israel's security 
zone in south Lebanon] and the occupied territories' [Israeli] 
prisons. 
  In a statement issued today, the follow-up committee said 
the 
humanity of the U.S. Congressional delegation is confined to 
Israeli soldiers while the fate of 300 prisoners in Israeli 
prisons is ignored. For over nine years Israel has refused to 
allow the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit 
al-Khiyam prison. And over 165 Lebanese have been held in the 
enemy's prisons since the 1982 invasion. Israel is also holding 
the bodies of 125 martyrs. 
  The committee said this shows the inhumane nature of the 
U.S. 
stance, which uses Israeli double standards and views our issue 
with an Israeli eye. 
  The committee called on the Lebanese Government to adopt a 
firm stance on the international silence regarding the issue of 
the detainees.

  [Text] Beirut, 8 Jan (MENA) -- A political official from 
Hizballah today restated the party's rejection of any meeting 
with a delegation from the U.S. Congress to discuss the fate of 
the Israeli soldiers who are missing in Lebanon. 
  'Ammar al-Musawi, deputy head of the Hizballah political 
bureau, told MENA in Beirut today that the present visit to 
Damascus by a party delegation is part of the constant 
consultations and meetings with Syrian officials to discuss 
local and regional developments. He denied that the meetings 
seek to make any contacts or arrange meetings with the members 
of the Congressional delegation visiting the Syrian capital at 
present. 
  Asked whether Hizballah has agreed to let Syrian officials 
act as mediators between Hizballah and the Congressional 
delegation to discuss the missing Israeli soldiers, al-Musawi 
said: The brothers in Damascus have not approached us about the 
possibility of holding a meeting with the Congressional 
delegation or about their readiness to mediate in the matter. 
  Al-Musawi pointed out that the party has no objection to 
discussing the issue of the missing Israeli soldiers provided 
that the discussion is conducted through UN-affiliated 
humanitarian organizations, like the International Committee of 
the Red Cross and the Human Rights Organization. 
  He said that the party has repeatedly emphasized that it has 
nothing to do with the missing Israeli pilot Ron Arad. All we 
have are two Israeli soldiers who were taken prisoner in 1986, 
he said. 
  The Hizballah official said the U.S. Administration and 
Congress are biased toward Israel and hence not qualified to 
discuss the issue of the missing Israelis, particularly since 
they both totally ignore the issue of the missing Lebanese 
nationals and the detainees in Israeli prisons. 
  The Congressional delegation arrived in Damascus yesterday 
from Tel Aviv to discuss the fate of a number of Israeli 
soldiers who are missing in Lebanon, in the wake of a promise by 
Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad to U.S. President Bill Clinton to 
facilitate the U.S. team's visit. 
  Reports have noted that the U.S. team arrived in Damascus at 
the same time as a senior Hizballah delegation was visiting the 
Syrian capital. Both sides, however, denied holding meetings. 
  Lebanese newspaper AL-SAFIR today reports that the Hizballah 
delegation had returned to Beirut the evening before last. 
However, AL-SAFIR adds, the party delegation returned to the 
Syrian capital yesterday in the wake of high-level contacts held 
yesterday morning. 
  Meanwhile, official Lebanese sources refused to comment on 
the possibility of a visit to Beirut by the U.S. Congressional 
delegation to meet with Lebanese officials. The sources stated 
that no arrangements have been made for such a visit.

  [Text] A U.S. Congress delegation entrusted to determine 
the fate of six Israeli soldiers missing in Lebanon will arrive 
in Beirut today. 
  According to Hizballah sources, a Hizballah delegation in 
Damascus for the past two days has met Syrian officials but no 
member of the U.S. delegation. 
  The U.S. delegation was expected to arrive in Lebanon 
yesterday afternoon but the visit was postponed until today 
following contacts between the Lebanese Government and the U.S. 
Embassy in Beirut. 
  The delegation is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Rafiq 
al-Hariri and Lebanese areas and villages. It is unlikely that 
Speaker Nabih Birri will receive the U.S. delegation. 
  Sources close to 'Allamah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah say 
Fadlallah is not interested in the delegation or its mission. 
According to diplomatic sources, Israel has conveyed an offer 
to the delegation saying it is ready to release all the Lebanese 
and Palestinian detainees once Israeli pilot Ron Arad is 
released. 
  Hizballah leaders have said they refuse to meet the U.S. 
delegation face to face but noted that this [communication] may 
take place through friendly powers. 
  Hizballah Political Bureau Chairman Husayn al-Khalil said 
there is no connection between Hizballah Secretary General Hasan 
Nasrallah's current visit to Damascus and the visit conducted by 
the U.S. Congressional delegation. He added that Nasrallah's 
visit was scheduled a week ago for talks with Syrian Vice 
President 'Abd-al- Halim Khaddam. Al-Khalil said: Khaddam did 
not discuss this issue with us and no efforts are being exerted 
in this regard. 
  Al-Khalil said Hizballah officials refuse to meet face to 
face with any U.S. official but he expressed willingness to look 
into the issue through an honest mediator who is not biased 
toward Israel. Al-Khalil said: We cannot give the Americans the 
honor of negotiating with us in this regard. 
  Al-Khalil said any party wishing to play this [mediation] 
role should guarantee the release of all the Lebanese and 
Palestinian detainees captured in Lebanese territory, including 
Shaykh 'Abd-al- Karim 'Ubayd.

  [Text] Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri has stated that his 
meeting with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad dealt with the 
internal situation in Lebanon, issues of common interest, the 
regional situation, the scheduled summit meeting between U.S. 
President Bill Clinton and President al-Asad, and the insistence 
of Lebanon and Syria on total Israeli withdrawal from the 
occupied Lebanese and Syrian territory. 
  Regarding the agreement to establish a joint Lebanese-Syrian 
power station, Prime Minister al-Hariri said it is a practical 
measure to implement the Brotherhood, Cooperation, and 
Coordination Agreement between the two countries. 
  Prime Minister al-Hariri added that the government's efforts 
for development and reconstruction are manifested daily through 
the projects which are being implemented. He noted that the 
political situation is cohesive as a result of consultations and 
understanding among the constitutional institutions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul by Walid </F>
Shuqayr and Muhammad Shuqayr in Beirut; date not 
given--individual correspondent not identified] 
  [Excerpt] [Correspondent] What are the circumstances 
surrounding the smashing of the network suspected of being 
responsible for the explosions in Tripoli and Sidon? 
  [Dallul] The aim seems to be to hinder the process of 
reconciliation and fence-mending in Lebanon. Security organs 
have, for some time, been following leads in this case. We have 
identified certain people--manipulated from outside the 
country--targeting certain positions, including commercial 
businesses in Tripoli and Sidon and Lebanese Army, and, at 
times, Syrian Army positions. Such incidents began to happen in 
rapid succession, particularly in Tripoli and Sidon, aiming at 
certain targets in particular. Nor did they target only stores 
selling alcoholic drinks. They also selected targets of a 
special nature and belonging to members of certain religious 
communities in particular. We had to pursue the matter. Having 
followed numerous leads, security forces busted the bulk of the 
subversive networks. There has not been any explosions in 
Tripoli or Sidon since. 
  [Correspondent] Don't you think that these explosions must 
be viewed within the context of a plan to destabilize Lebanon in 
the run-up to the al-Asad-Clinton summit? And what do you think 
about reports of attempts on the lives of al-Asad and Clinton 
and al-Hirawi? 
  [Dallul] Talk about attempts on the life of President 
al-Hirawi is nothing new; it dates to 1991. I don't know why it 
is being raised now. I think that raising the subject at this 
point in particular is calculated to create a climate of panic 
and fear. As to why that is, the aim is manifold: For one 
thing, to undermine al-Asad's position ahead of his scheduled 
session with President Clinton, so Lebanon becomes a liability 
for the Syrian leader. For another, to deflect attention from 
the stalled Gaza-Jericho accord, especially given the fact that 
Lebanon, as a democracy, affords the right and regionally 
unmatched climate for the media to disseminate such reports. 
Third, the idea is to undermine Lebanon's negotiating position, 
especially after King Husayn of Jordan criticized the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement [as published] and the PLO and the way it 
handled the negotiations, and adopted Syria's and Lebanon's 
line. For us, this is a key issue. The U.S. line has, 
throughout, been to support Israel's argument that it needs a 
breather to absorb the Gaza-Jericho accord before progress can 
be made on the other tracks. 
  The Americans were a bit doubtful that the Gaza-Jericho 
first 
option could advance without parallel progress on the other 
tracks. Our argument, and that of the Syrians', was that, unless 
accompanied by progress on the other tracks, the Gaza-Jericho 
accord, stood no chance. Now, the Gaza-Jericho accord has 
proved a losing bet. There is now a consensus on the need for 
movement on the other tracks. 
  [Correspondent] Is it fair to draw the conclusion that the 
activities of these subversive networks were to counteract 
opposition to the Gaza-Jericho agreement? 
  [Dallul] I don't want to divulge secrets just yet. However, 
the security organs investigating the explosions will before 
long reveal facts to the news media if they think it necessary. 
The explosions did not appear out of the blue. They destroyed 
business premises and other property, and were calculated to 
advance specific objectives. The circles with a vested interest 
in destabilizing and undermining Lebanon and al-Asad's position 
as the date for his summit with Clinton draws near, will go to 
great lengths to promote the interests of the other side. 
  We are not pointing accusing fingers at anyone in 
particular. 
However, there are many forces that reckon they can use the 
Lebanese arena to advance their strategies. 
  [Correspondent] A person has been killed and another 
wounded on the Darb al-Sim [name as published] east of Sidon. 
Reports say they are Palestinians and they were carrying 
explosives. Have you got any information about them and the side 
to which they belong? 
  [Dallul] It is premature to disclose this information. 
Investigation and arrests are still under way. The issue is 
related to more than one event, and secrecy will benefit both 
the investigation and the issue. 
  [Correspondent] Are you optimistic about the possible 
results 
of the 12th round of negotiations? 
  [Dallul] Certainly, because the Syrian and Lebanese tracks 
cannot be separated. President al-Asad stressed this personally 
and refused to separate the liberation of southern Lebanon from 
that of the Golan. 
  Regarding pessimism or optimism, Resolution No. 425 was 
issued by the Security Council and not by the UN General 
Assembly. I believe it constitutes a confusion and a setback in 
the Lebanese policy but not a disaster because we have a 
Security Council resolution. We went to the negotiations under 
the Madrid formula and after receiving letters of assurance from 
the sponsors of the conference, the United States and Russia, 
which dealt with Resolution No. 425 and its implementation. 
Were it not for this resolution, we would not have taken part 
in the negotiations. Hence, the issue is related to a certain 
mechanism that will exist. It is certain that the upcoming 
summit of President al-Asad and President Clinton implies 
optimism and lessons to be learned. In other words, the 
steadfast, rather than those who are loitering at the gates of 
the White House and the gates of embassies, always succeed. 
  President al-Asad is the only leader in the world who meets 
the U.S. President in the middle of the road. This has not 
happened to any president in the world. All leaders support 
al-Asad, and the meeting is a victory for President al-Asad 
because he still controls matters despite reports and 
allegations that Syria and Lebanon are in trouble and that the 
Gaza-Jericho option has stolen the limelight and will lead to 
peace at the expense of the Golan and southern Lebanon. 
  This is not true at all, and the upcoming meeting in Geneva 
proves that the weight is still here and not there. The Syrian 
and Lebanese tracks should move together to achieve progress in 
the Gaza-Jericho track. If the Syrian and Lebanese tracks do 
not achieve progress, the Gaza-Jericho agreement will soon fail. 
  President Clinton will not come to a meeting unless he 
believes he can push matters toward peace in the Middle East. 
Otherwise, the move would weaken his position and not that of 
al-Asad, who is still steadfast and adheres to a certain 
position. Therefore, Clinton may have become confident that he 
can force Israel to offer realistic concessions or persuade it 
of such a need--concessions which are Arab rights and which the 
Arabs want to regain. Without these, he cannot attend any 
summit because it will be a big failure for his policy, in 
addition to his repeated failure in Somalia, Bosnia- 
Herzegovina, and other states. He also has domestic and foreign 
problems and he cannot afford another big defeat like this. 
  If the Geneva conference succeeds, it will cover all his 
defeats because the results of the conference will be much more 
bigger than what is taking place in Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
or any other country in the world. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Mahmud Mashmushi editorial: "The Geneva Summit and Syria's </F>
Role in the Region"] 
  [Text] Ahead of the summit between Presidents Bill Clinton 
and Hafiz al-Asad on 16 January, U.S. officials want to point 
out that the summit would not have been held without earlier 
consultations touching on an "agreement" on achieving what a 
U.S. presidential adviser in the past few hours described as 
"substantive progress" on the Syrian-Israeli track and 
consequently the Lebanese-Israeli track. 
  In conversation, U.S. officials do not hesitate to brandish 
the "terrorism list" that they prepared themselves and according 
to which they have classified the world. They keep reminding 
Syria that it remains on this list and that Hizballah and other 
organizations working against the Israeli occupation of south 
Lebanon are being directly supported by Damascus with the 
blessing and nonobjection of Beirut. 
  With this two-faced stance the Americans are sitting on the 
fence, as the popular saying goes. They are not opening the 
door completely to Damascus and Beirut but they are not closing 
it completely. In common parlance, this is called "blackmail" 
or "bargaining." In politics it is called "gathering paper" and 
"negotiating from a strong position." 
  It might be comprehensible and even logical for the Israelis 
to resort to this method of dealing with an Arab party, 
including Syria and Lebanon. But it is incomprehensible and 
illogical for such behavior to come from the United States, 
which presents itself sometimes as an "honest mediator" and at 
other times as a "full partner" in the peace process. It is 
also incomprehensible and illogical for successive U.S. 
Administrations to continue this policy if they really want to 
close the file of 50 years of war in the Middle East. Such a 
policy leads to further Israeli intransigence and to keeping the 
file open. 
  Assuming that the U.S. logic is correct, "Arab terrorism" is 
new to the region. Given the age of the crisis and the wars it 
has spawned, terrorism was first introduced by the Zionists. 
Hizballah and the various Palestinian and non-Palestinian 
organizations before it won't be the last if no "just, 
comprehensive, and permanent" settlement is reached. 
  No one doubts the importance of this summit for settling the 
Arab-Israeli conflict and for the future of the region in this 
transitional phase in a world with one superpower. But the 
world might see the reemergence of two superpowers, even three, 
four, or five superpowers. 
  President al-Asad is the kind of leader who does not view 
tomorrow as the next 24 hours, but measures it by decades and 
generations in human history. This has always been his problem, 
not only with the United States and the West, but also with his 
Soviet friends. 
  The Geneva summit in one week's time might be an opportunity 
for President Clinton, the leader of the sole superpower, to get 
acquainted with President al-Asad's concept of Syria's "basic 
role"--to which U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
referred yesterday--not only in a settlement, but in the 
regional landscape after a settlement and under the new world 
order.

<F P=106> [Statement by Progressive Socialist Party Leader and Refugee </F>
Affairs Minister Walid Junblatt; place and date not given--read 
by announcer] 
  [Text] Local and regional developments require a pause to 
examine certain basic facts and to explain certain points. 
  1. If the Vatican's policy has been criticized, this is 
because we look at the Vatican as one of this world's states. 
We distinguish between this state and Christianity, which is 
one of the heavenly religions. However, it is our duty to draw 
the Vatican's attention to the dangers involved in making peace 
or normalizing relations with the state of Israel and admitting, 
one way or another, the commission of a sin against the Jewish 
people. 
  The state of Israel was proclaimed as a result of the 
Western 
Nazi's persecution of the Jewish people. And thence came the 
tragedy of the Palestinian people. Today the Vatican recognizes 
the state of Israel. This recognition may involve a second 
crime against the Arab people, with all their subdivisions and 
sects. We are entitled to draw attention to the possible 
political, ideological, and cultural implications of that 
recognition for the Arab world. 
  2. The stand taken by the Coptic Church, led by struggler 
Pope Shanudah, reiterated that the danger involved in 
normalizing relations with Israel--with Zionism--will harm 
Christians and Muslims alike. Pope Shanudah's stance is a 
historic one that goes back to pharaonic times and the Jews' 
exodus from Egypt during Moses' time. 
  The Copts are the heirs of the Pharaohs, the original 
Egyptian natives. Even after Arab and Islamic conquests, the 
Copts without hesitation stood by Egypt's rulers, Arabs and 
Muslims alike, to confront foreign invasions, Crusades and 
otherwise. It is no coincidence that Salah-al-Din built them a 
church close to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in 
Jerusalem--the Dayr-al-Sultan Church. It is also no coincidence 
that Coptic figures assumed high- ranking positions, including 
ministers of finance and war during Salah-al-Din's time and 
later during Muhammad 'Ali's time. The name of [former Egyptian 
Prime Minister] Makram 'Ubayd was associated with that of Sa'd 
Zaghlul in rejecting the British mandate. This genuinely 
nationalist church has taken many other historic stances. The 
latest of these was when Pope Shanudah rejected the Camp David 
accords and was exiled by al-Sadat to the desert. 
  That is why we always distinguish between the policy of the 
church, whether in the Vatican or in Lebanon, and the Christian 
people. We affirm that the return of the refugees will continue 
at the various levels and that it will not be affected by a 
statement made here or there. 
  We appeal to the Egyptian opposition not to attack the 
Copts. 
Negotiations were forced on the Arabs by the United States. But 
the future of Arabs, Muslims and Christians, and the future of 
the Islamic region, are still in our hands. If we act properly, 
we can stand fast, even in peace, against the Zionist political, 
cultural, and economic hazards. 
  In the cultural fields, it is necessary to consolidate the 
cultural immunity, in Asyut and elsewhere. The battle is with 
the Egyptian regime, its foolish rejection of dialogue with the 
opposition, and its persistence in carrying out executions. The 
battle is not and will not be with Egypt's Copts. 
  3. These historic points make it incumbent on us to draw up 
an Arab Islamic confrontation plan that goes beyond tactics for 
talks in Washington and elsewhere. This plan should involve the 
Christian, Islamic, and even some struggling Jewish sects that 
reject racism, in confronting Zionism. Not all Jews are 
Zionists; and it is not right to generalize. In history, 
prominent strugglers in the communist, socialist, and world 
labor movements, as well as imperialism-resisting movements, 
were Jews. 
  A plan to guarantee political immunity must be developed, 
because Israel will only seek to destroy the region and divide 
its people into tribes, clans, and sects so that Jerusalem can 
become another Mecca, or the political and economic center for 
Arabs and Muslims. 
  Containing such a hazard would make confrontation much 
easier, even if Israeli flags were temporarily hoisted in some 
Arab capitals. 
  As far as the economic aspect is concerned, only an Arab, 
Islamic common market extending from Iran to the Islamic states 
in Asia Minor and Turkey can balance the Israeli strategy of 
seeking, among other things, to control the Arab and Islamic 
market and steal our wealth. 
  These are some of the basic things that should be developed 
before it is too late to protect the Christians and Muslims of 
the Orient from the hazards of peace or settlement with Israel.

  [Text] Beirut, Jan 7, IRNA -- Leading Lebanese Muslim 
leader al-'Allamah Seyyed Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah said in his 
Friday prayer sermons here today that the world Muslims should 
be on the side of Islamic Iran in its encounter with the attacks 
of world arrogance. 
  He said the word `fundamentalism' is a result of the western 
propaganda and has been used with the idea of discrediting the 
political opposition to the west. 
  Fadlallah said Arab governments should learn a lesson from 
what has befallen the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) 
and learn also that their recognition of the Zionist regime will 
offer them only infamy and wretchedness. 
  Meanwhile in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli, leader 
of 
the Islamic Unity Movement of Lebanon, Sheykh sa'id Sha'ban, 
said during his Friday prayer sermons today that the United 
States and other arrogant world governments are drafting a 
scheme with which to pit Muslim and Arab nations against one 
another. 
  He criticized the Arab governments that promote the goals of 
the United States. 
  Sha'ban said had the resources of Muslim governments been 
devoted to the promotion of the Islamic movement the world would 
now have witnessed the creation of a big Islamic force.

<F P=106> [Statement by the Lebanese Forces' Central Information </F>
Agency issued on 8 January--read by announcer] 
  [Text] Some media organizations have recently leaked 
fabricated news on an alleged attempt to assassinate President 
Ilyas al-Hirawi in 1990-1991 [date as heard]. The reports made 
implicit and sometimes explicit references accusing the Lebanese 
Forces of being behind the alleged attempt. In view of the 
persistent reports on this issue, despite the denial made last 
week by presidential sources, the Lebanese Forces finds itself 
compelled to announce the following: 
  1. The contradictory information contained in the leaked 
reports regarding the alleged attempt to assassinate the 
president shows that the reports are not valid. One of the 
fabricated reports spoke of an attempt against the president's 
life in his office in the temporary presidential headquarters in 
al-Ramlah al-Bayda', another report mentioned the Cabinet 
meeting room, and others mentioned his house in al-Hazimiyah. 
  2. Such media schemes are part of the ongoing efforts to 
cause confusion in the public and create an atmosphere of 
mistrust among official, political, and party leaders. The 
Lebanese Forces views these schemes as an attempt to undermine 
national unity, internal peace, and public stability. 
  3. On this occasion, the Lebanese Forces would like to 
reiterate its positions on the Lebanese legitimate authority 
established under the National Accord agreement. The Lebanese 
Forces also would like to remind everyone of its repeated calls 
on all parties to get involved in national reconciliation and 
join the legitimate institutions, which would be the strongest 
proof of the invalidity of the fabricated news about imaginary 
operations and attempts. Such news only serves the interests of 
those who are trying to cause new rifts within the Lebanese 
official body at a time when the officials who are the subject 
of such rumors know what is happening. 
  4. The insistence of treating the Lebanese Forces as a 
former militia, disregarding the vast political current it 
represents, seeks to undermine its role and image by searching 
in the past for twisted and untrue incidents to use against it 
in the present. This is proof that some people are adamant not 
to accept the realities of coexistence, accord, and political 
and democratic practices, as stipulated under the law and 
guaranteed by the Constitution. 
  5. While expressing its deep regret for the failure to 
comply with the great national decision to close the chapter of 
war with all its details and to engage in public affairs, the 
Lebanese Forces calls on all Lebanese to live up to the current 
stage and to concentrate their efforts on exposing the schemes 
hatched against Lebanon at present and in the future. Instead 
of attempting to distract attention from the real dangers facing 
Lebanon and its people, efforts should be made to reveal the 
real perpetrators and planners of recent bombings, such as the 
one against the Phalangist Party headquarters, as well as other 
incidents that have sought to disrupt security.

  [Text] Baghdad, Jan 9 (AFP) -- International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) experts are preparing the transfer of a second 
batch of Iraqi enriched uranium to Russia, UN sources said here 
Sunday [9 January]. 
  The team is working at a site near Baghdad and hopes to 
complete its mission by the end of January, the sources said 
without specifying the quantity involved. 
  Last month the same group supervised the removal and 
shipment 
by air of 33 kilograms (73 pounds) of irradiated fuel from Iraq 
to Russia. 
  In October, IAEA chief Maurizio Zifferero said that some 35 
kilograms (77 pounds) of enriched uranium would be transferred 
to Russia. 
  The IAEA, a Vienna-based United Nations agency, and Iraq 
signed an accord in April for the removal of 35 kilograms of 
uranium. The agreement was reached during a mission of IAEA 
inspectors led by Zifferero, who said at the time that the 
operation would cost Iraq several million dollars. 
  Last November the IAEA shipped 12 kilograms (27 pounds) of 
non-enriched uranium from Iraq to Russia. 
  The transfers are in line with UN Security Council 
resolutions to disarm Iraq after the Gulf war in 1991.

the self-declared Kurdish government in northern Iraq asked his 
British counterpart John Major to help exempt Kurdistan from a 
UN embargo against Baghdad, Kurdish sources said Sunday [9 
January]. 
  Kusret Rasul sought Major's cooperation in bringing about a 
partial lifting of the embargo to help "improve the material 
situation of our people" in a letter handed to Britain's Lord 
Archer who was in Kurdistan last week. 
  Lord Archer, better known as the author Jeffrey Archer, 
addressed the Kurdish regional parliament on Wednesday and 
delivered a message from Major, recognizing it. 
  Archer said Britain would contribute through the United 
Nations, the European Community and directly to the humanitarian 
aid budget pledged by the international community to the Kurdish 
autonomous region. 
  The trade embargo was imposed on Iraq after its invasion of 
Kuwait in August 1990. The northern Iraqi Kurdish autonomous 
region is affected by the sanctions, being part of the country.

<F P=106> [Interview with Army Chief of Staff Iyad Futayyih al-Rawi by </F>
Nadiah Shakarah in Baghdad on the 73d anniversary of the Iraqi 
Army] 
  [Excerpts] Despite his busy schedule, we have managed to 
visit briefly with fighter Staff General Iyad Futayyih al-Rawi, 
Army chief of staff, and hold this interview with him in his 
office at the Defense Ministry. [passage omitted] 
  [Shakarah] An historic document dated 1932 lists statistics 
on the Iraqi Army. It says that when Iraq joined the League of 
Nations, the Army had only two divisions and only 549 officers, 
9,320 noncommissioned officers and soldiers, and 794 volunteers. 
What is the size of the Iraqi Army now? 
  [Al-Rawi] From its formation until the 14 July 1958 
revolution, the Iraqi Army was a small one, incapable of meeting 
the national and pan-Arab requirements to defend the Arab nation 
and serve its national objectives. The colonialists were trying 
to impose their control over the Army and use it as a tool to 
protect their colonialist objectives and schemes and crush any 
nationalist movement by force. After 1958, the Army began to 
grow gradually with the formation of new divisions. Then, the 
17-30 July 1968 Revolution brought to power a nationalist 
authority that believes in national and pan-Arab objectives. 
That authority adopted a long-term policy to rebuild the Army 
on strong revolutionary bases. Thanks to mujahid leader 
President Saddam Husayn, may God protect and preserve him, the 
Army became the revolution's striking arm and vigilant eye that 
protects the homeland and the people's achievements. The Army 
was organized on modern, scientific bases, and its combat 
capabilities and technical methods were improved. The formations 
were significantly enlarged until today when it has become the 
fourth largest Army in the world after the U.S., Russian, and 
Chinese Armies. [passage omitted]

Dr. Farooq Abdullah, has expressed the hope that significant 
results in curbing militancy would lead to restoration of 
normalcy in the Kashmir valley. Dr. Abdullah met the state 
governor, General K.V. Krishna Rao, in Jammu today and discussed 
measures for early restoration of peace in the troubled state. 
The former chief minister also complimented the governor on the

urged the government to initiate a dialogue with the leaders 
from the Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh regions to find a lasting 
solution to the present turmoil in the Kashmir valley.

  [Text] In occupied Kashmir, the All Party Hurriyyat 
Conference called for a strike and demonstrations tomorrow to 
protest Indian atrocities and to mark the anniversary of the 
ascension to heaven by Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. 
These demonstrations are also designed to protest the continued 
siege of the Hazratbal Shrine, which the people visit to pay 
respect to the sacred relic -- a hair from the beard of the holy 
Prophet Muhammad, may the blessing and mercy of God be upon him. 
This year, the people will not be able to visit the Hazratbal 
Shrine because of the siege laid by Indian forces. 
  Meanwhile, 20 people have been killed and several others 
arrested in the fresh operations carried out by occupation 
forces in the occupied valley. An Indian military vehicle was 
destroyed and two soldiers were killed in a land mine explosion 
in the Nawanshahr area. In another operation, the freedom 
fighters damaged the water supply system of Punch Cantonment. 
According to another report, the freedom fighters attacked a 
military position with a hand grenade in the Charasa area of 
Srinagar, wounding a number of soldiers. There are also reports 
of clashes between the freedom fighters and the Indian forces at 
(Zomaran Top) of Doda District, in which several soldiers were 
either killed or wounded. 
  Syed Ali Jilani, a leader of the freedom movement, in a 
press 
statment has appreciated the sentiments expressed by President 
Clinton in his letter to Dr. Ghulam Nabi Fai, the director of 
the Kashmir-American Council. Jilani said it is the result of 
the unprecedented sacrifice of the Kashmiris that the United 
States and Western countries have begun to take note of the 
Kashmir situation. 
  Mohammad Farooq Rahmani, the Jammu and Kashmir People's 
League, has appealed to the Kashmiri people to observe Indian 
Republic Day on 26 January as a black day. He said on this day, 
normal life activities should be suspended and all lights kept 
switched off in the evening, to prove that the future of India 
and Kashmir is different from each other. Rahmani has also 
appealed to the people of Azad Kashmir to express solidarity 
with their brethren living on the other side of the cease-fire 
line.

  [Text] Reports from occupied Kashmir speak of widespread 
demonstrations and strikes against the Indian military siege of 
Dargah Hazratbal [shrine] to prevent the devotees from ziyarat 
[paying respect to] of mue-i-mubarak [holy hair] on the occasion 
of Merajunnabi [anniversary of prophet Mohammad's ascension to 
heaven]. 
  The demonstrations were particularly violent in Srinagar, 
Baramula, Kupwara, Anantnag-Islamabad, Sopor, Badgam, and 
Pulwama. The demonstrators raised slogans and demanded complete 
withdrawal of Indian troops from around the dargah. Meanwhile, 
repressive siege and search operations by the occupation forces 
continue unabated all across the valley. The mojahedin in 
retaliation attacked the Indian troops and killed three of them. 
Three mojahedin were martyred in a clash near Badgam. Three 
bullet-riddled bodies suspected to be killed by the Indian 
troops have been recovered in Kupwara.

  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 2 (PTI) -- India and China will soon 
start talks on reducing troop-levels on both sides of the line 
of actual control (LAC) in pursuance of an agreement signed 
during the Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's visit to Beijing 
last September, Chinese ambassador Cheng Ruisheng, said in an 
interview here. 
  "Both sides may have already reduced some troops, but I am 
not aware of the facts. Both sides want to divert their 
resources from military to economic development," Mr Cheng said. 
  The Chinese ambassador said that an experts group of 
diplomats and military personnel, set up as part of the 
agreement on maintenance of peace and tranquillity along the 
LAC, would hold its first meeting in New Delhi next month. 
  He said the experts group would tackle the issue relating to 
the redeployment with a view to reduction in military forces in 
the areas along the LAC. 
  The experts group, which will have about 10 members from 
each 
side, shall advise the Foreign Secretary-level joint working 
group (JWG) on the resolution of differences between the two 
sides on the alignment of the line of actual control. 
  Replying to wide-ranging questions, Mr. Cheng said there was 
no Pakistan factor in China's development of relations with 
India. 
  Describing "stability and overall improvement" as the main 
characteristics of the Sino-Indian relations in 1993, he said if 
China used India or Pakistan as a card for developing bilateral 
relations, it would "complicate matters very much." 
  He emphasised that India and China had achieved a 
breakthrough in exchanges in the military field. 
  The visit of the Chinese vice chief of Army staff to India 
last month came after a gap of over 30 years. Like-wise, the 
Chinese naval ships visited Bombay nearly after 40 years. 
  India and China had problems in 1962 but that was part of 
history now. "We are trying to catch up with the lost time," the 
Chinese envoy said. 
  He emphasised that there was no such gap in the development 
of China's relations with Pakistan. 
  Mr. Cheng agreed with the questioner that the human rights 
issue was being exploited by the west. 
  The Chinese envoy said India and China had identical views 
on 
the human rights issue. 
  "We are of the opinion that differences on the human rights 
issue should not be linked with bilateral relations including 
trade or economic ties," he said. 
  Replying to a question on the nuclear issue, Mr. Cheng 
referred to differing perceptions between India and China. 
  China had already signed the nuclear non-proliferation 
treaty. India was not prepared to do the same, he observed. 
  Mr. Cheng said his country was in favour of a nuclear 
weapons 
free zone in South Asia as there was no nuclear power in the 
region. 
  China, he said, felt that the two major world powers should 
reduce their nuclear weapons. 
  Asked about the Chinese military assistance to Pakistan, he 
said this did not pose any threat to India. 
  He made the point that China was involved in commercial 
sales 
of military hardware and India could also be a buyer if it so 
desired.

  [Text] India and China are planning to jointly manufacture 
commercial aircraft. Feasibility studies are now on to make 
planes with the capacity [of] up to 100 seats. The Chinese 
ambassador, Mr. Cheng Ruisheng, told PTI in New Delhi that the 
two countries proposed to pool their technological and other 
resources for the project. The studies are to be undertaken by 
experts of the National Aeronautical Laboratory and the 
Aerotechnology Research Institute of China. Mr. Cheng said both 
India and China have good military planes and they can diversify 
the capability to the civilian side. As the two countries are 
carrying out economic reforms, they will also be able to acquire 
better technology for the project, he said. The ambassador also 
felt that there is great scope for stepping up bilateral trade 
as it accounts for just 1 percent of India's foreign trade. He 
said China is trying to introduce Indian technical know-how in 
the computer field and is interested in launching Indian 
satellites which will be cheaper than other European launchers.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Foreign Hand in NE"] </F>
  [Text] Army spokesmen have painted a very disturbing 
picture of the state of insurgency in the North-East. According 
to Lt. Gen Niranjan S. Malik who has been briefing the press, 
insurgent groups particularly in trouble-torn Nagaland and 
Manipur, are better armed and more militant than ever before. 
Bomb blasts, assassination attempts and `genocide', he 
reportedly said, have become the order of the day. The 
escalation in insurgent activity is ascribed to various factors. 
The most serious of them is the patronage of foreign agencies. 
Although it has long been suspected that some rebel groups have 
been assisted by Bangladesh and Pakistan's Inter-Services 
Intelligence [ISI] agency, this is probably the first time that 
the seniormost army officer in the region has said as much. He 
claimed to have definite knowledge of other sources of foreign 
aid to the rebels as well. 
  Malik specifically named the Muivah-Swu faction of the 
National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-M) as a beneficiary 
in this context. The ISI is said to have launched a new 
organisation called the United Liberation Front of Seven Sisters 
in which the NSCN(M), the United Liberation Front of Assam 
(ULFA), the Bodo Security Force and other tribal groups are key 
participants. Just as disquieting was the revelation that the 
banned NSCN(M) which has emerged as one of the most formidable 
outfits in the North-East was recruiting immigrant Muslims. In 
the army's perception, the NSCN(M) has received a major 
psychological boost by being admitted as a member of the 
Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organisation based at the 
Hague and apparently gets financial assistance from it as well 
as from the American Baptist Church. All this has encouraged 
insurgent leaders on the one hand to believe that their cause 
has received international recognition and on the other to 
acquire arms and ammunition more easily. Last but not least, 
army officers say that the Nagaland police force has been 
grossly negligent in allowing its weapons to fall into the hands 
of underground groups. 
  In this grim backdrop some comfort may be drawn from the 
fact 
of the doubling of security forces and army units deployed in 
the North-East since October 1. However, the army briefing 
raises crucial questions about the overall strategy being 
pursued by the Central Government in dealing with what appears 
to be a heightened level of insurgency. Clearly, if the army 
assessment of the situation is accepted, anti-insurgency 
operations will have to be stepped up especially in border 
areas. But this should not preclude political measures among 
which should be steps to stabilise and improve the functioning 
of the governments of Nagaland and Manipur. They will have to 
become both more responsive to popular aspirations and firm in 
dealing with troublemakers than they have proved so far to be.

economy as outstanding during the first state economic, social, 
and cultural development plan, and he said: During the years 
when the First Development Plan was being implemented, while the 
international economy was facing a recession we were one of the 
five countries which advanced its economy at a relatively high 
percentage. 
  He said: While in 1993 the world economic growth has been 
estimated to be 1.2 percent, our economy in the current year 
[Iranian year beginning 21 March 1993] has enjoyed a growth of 
7.7 percent. 
  On investment in various economic sectors, the minister of 
finance and economic affairs said: During the First Plan we 
spent more than one third of our foreign currency earnings on 
investment in development plans and production projects. Ninety 
percent of our debts are connected with that type of investment. 
He pointed out that more than 50 percent of the state foreign 
currency earnings during the years when the First Plan was being 
implemented were used up on investments in development projects. 
  In the field of the domestic GNP, Mohammad-Khani said: In 
1367 [year beginning 21 March 1988] the GNP was 7 percent. It 
reached 14 percent in 1371. 
  He continued: On average the added value [as heard] in the 
agricultural sector during the period of the First Plan grew by 
5.9 percent. That is 0.3 percent more than envisaged in the 
plan so that the volume of the added value of the sector 
compared to the beginning of the plan has increased four fold. 
  Announcing that non-oil exports grew by 28.7 percent in the 
First Plan period, he described one of the most important 
objectives of the First Plan to be replacing imports. He 
recalled the role of non-oil exports in reducing the state 
foreign currency requirements and said: At the moment the 
increase in domestic products in the field of oil refining, 
petrochemical, intermediate, and consumer industries is 
satisfactory so that our domestic products have grown to such an 
extent that they can reduce the country's foreign currency 
requirements to one third of those in 1367. That indicates the 
success of the economic move in that field. 
  The finance and economic affairs minister said that the 
forecast in the First Plan for the annual growth rate of the 
public sector spending was 24.4 percent and added: Nevertheless 
the forecast of the public sector spending growth rate in the 
Second Development Plan amounts to 43.2 percent. The reason for 
that is the growth of the government's development expenses. 
  Referring to the high volume of investment in the production 
sector, the reduction of the state foreign currency requirements 
for importing capital-intensive goods as well as the 
arrangements made in the past few weeks to regulate the currency 
market, Mohammad-Khani considered the effect of oil price 
reductions in the trend of the state economic movement to be 
little. 
  He considered the combination of implemented policies in 
support of domestic products, creating employment, supporting 
the national currency and regulating the state economic 
structure as significant and said that at the moment inflation 
and consumerism are two of the worst of the country's 
fundamental problems. On inflation, Mohammad-Khani said: The 
rapid growth of the economic structure, international recession, 
population growth, and a tendency toward consumerism in the 
community, have beset the regulation and coordination of 
economic and social development with difficulties and directed 
the greater part of the pressure resulting from that growth 
toward the salaried stratum. Therefore the government is duty 
bound to pay more attention to reduce that pressure on the 
vulnerable strata. The rate of inflation as well as the 
pressure on the low-income strata will be reduced through the 
start of commissioning production projects -- in which 
investment has been made -- as a result of increased supply, 
government support for vulnerable strata and a reform of the tax 
system. 
  Continuing, the finance and economic affairs minister said: 
the annual rate of consumption during the period of the First 
Plan was forecast to be 5 percent. We have now reached a figure 
of 10 percent. That is why it is necessary for the public and 
private sectors to act to reduce consumption and cooperate to 
adjust the state economic status. He added: One of the policies 
of the government in the First Plan was to pave the way for 
investment in the Second Plan in the private sector, and the 
government intends to bring about increased investor confidence 
by supporting domestic investments.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "When Someone Else Foots the </F>
Bill..."] 
  [Text] Speaking to the heads of the country's universities 
and higher education institutions, Hojjat ol-Eslam 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani said that the government has acted very 
strongly in the First and Second Five-Year Plans and described 
as minimal the impact that the fluctuations in the world market 
and the drop in oil prices have on the country's infrastructural 
plans, adding that with the existence of efficient forces and 
thanks to economizing in foreign exchange in implementing the 
major development projects, we can continue to advance our 
development without the help of foreign exchange income. 
  The day after these remarks, Mas'ud Rowghani-Zanjani, who 
heads the Plan and Budget Organization, said in an interview: 
In order to free the country's economy from the recent 
fluctuations and in view of the drop in the oil income that was 
to finance infrastructural and development projects in the 
Second Plan, efforts are being made to find new sources (!) of 
investment and to increase the prices of services such as 
electricity, oil products, telecommunications, gas, and so on, 
and to meet in this way the financial needs for the 
implementation of infrastructural projects (!). 
  The president's remarks that the reduction in oil prices 
will 
not have any impact on our economy and that the country's 
development projects are not linked with our foreign exchange 
incomes are surprising, because even the most naive people in 
the country know that Iran is a single-product country that is 
extremely dependent on oil. This is so crystal clear that no 
facts and figures are necessary to prove it. In other words, 
the president's remarks are a big riddle: How can development 
projects be completed and infrastructural investments be made 
without any foreign exchange income? 
  But fortunately the head of the Plan and Budget Organization 
solved this riddle very quickly in his interview and clarified 
where the money to be spent is to come from. Of course, Mr. 
Rowghani-Zanjani did not clarify how new investments will be 
acquired and what the nature of these investments will be; and 
apparently there has been no mention of how investments from 
abroad are to be acquired in the Second Plan either. This comes 
at a time when the First Plan and the government's economic 
reform policies have been frustrated basically because of the 
failure to attract any foreign investment or foreign financial 
resources. Thus, if we discount his reference to acquiring new 
resources, we will see that the country's economic development 
will be paid for from the people's pocket. In other words, the 
gist of the remarks both by the president and by the head of the 
Plan and Budget Organization is the old adage that it is easy to 
be a big spender with other people's money.

<F P=106> [Mohammad Sarafraz editorial: "Believing in the West--The </F>
Major Problem"] 
  [Text] When looking at the country's major problems, we 
should try to identify the most significant of these problems 
and try to find a solution. Otherwise, we will not be able to 
solve even the most minor issues. The First Plan started with 
the slogan of more production and production in all fields. But 
in the end, we had unrestrained imports and foreign debts. 
Economic growth and development in various dimensions is 
laudable. But the issue is at what price we achieve all this. 
  1. We have definitely suffered from weak management of the 
country's financial resources. The officials at the Ministry of 
Economy and Financial Affairs, as well as at the Central Bank 
and the Plan and Budget Organization did not provide timely 
information on the country's foreign exchange debts and its 
massive purchases. As a result, we lacked correct management for 
repayment of the country's debts, and ultimately our bank 
credits decreased and their guarantees were not accepted. For 
purchases from abroad, a third party should ensure our bank 
guarantees, which would lead to a considerable rise in the 
prices of imported goods. Who is responsible for the losses 
that have been inflicted on the country? What is the role of the 
Majles? 
  2. The Ministry of Industries and the Ministry of Heavy 
Industries resorted to foreign purchases that were outside the 
framework of the Plan and thus placed heavy burdens on the 
shoulders of the country. Purchases on a usance [preceding word 
in English] basis are usually carried out when the buyer is sure 
that he can repay within a short period of time. Otherwise, the 
interest on what he owes increases considerably and thus makes 
problems twice as bad. Such purchases took place outside the 
Plan, which was approved by the Majles. These same industries 
received $33.5 billion in foreign exchange, which is more than 
they were authorized. And the interesting point is that this 
violation was coupled with other violations, such as using up 
resources in industries for consumer goods that were outside the 
framework of the Plan instead of investing as was envisaged by 
the approved Plan. What is the duty of the Majles in relation 
with this? 
  Management weakness should be dealt with appropriately. But 
more important than this is the way such behavior is justified. 
  In justifying the excessive rise in consumerism and in 
consumer industries, the minister of industries said in an 
interview on 23 November 1993: "When a market and a free 
economy mechanism prevails, demand regulates supplies and the 
production or non-production of an item cannot be dictated." 
This comes at a time when we believe that "free economy" is 
what the Westerners have to say; but that we do not want to 
follow the West but the correct Islamic policy, as our society 
and system requires. 
  In the Islamic system, supply and demand is controlled. 
Starting from the government and moving down to the most 
ordinary citizen, everyone has to decrease demand and prevent 
waste. This is at a time when a weak approach to advertising 
has led to an unrestrained increase in consumerism in the 
country and when the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran too is playing a noteworthy part in encouraging consumerism. 
  The most important aspect of believing in the West is 
accepting the West's pattern; and we see this being manifested 
in the country's planning. Today we should accept the fact that 
technocrats and those whose plans do not have a religions basis 
are influential. What they are doing is to overshadow cultural 
and spiritual growth with consumerism and gaudiness and then 
blame the clergy and the system for the result of their efforts. 
The idea that the economy is a worldly issue and that we should 
lean on it to choose in which direction we want to move makes us 
to consider our efforts to achieve development and, more 
important yet, to achieve security to be contingent on 
astronomic loans from European countries. But even if we 
disregard the problems that stem from this type of outlook and 
only take into consideration the experiences of those countries 
that have tread this path, we will realize that we will not 
achieve what we want. But if we stop tying our hopes for 
economic development to the West and rely on our domestic 
resources, then we will definitely be able to achieve our 
objectives much more quickly. We should not forget that the 
main objective is to ensure social justice and to tend to the 
deprived masses of the country.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] These days the debate on Clinton's financial misuse 
is escalating in the U.S. press and in Congress. Recently one 
of America's most important newspapers warned that the 
suspicious financial dealings of President Bill Clinton and his 
wife have taken away the people's confidence in the White House 
statesmen. Last week, the U.S. Congress Republican leaders 
called for an investigation into President Clinton's role in 
land and estate deals in Arkansas. Republican leaders called on 
U.S. Attorney-General Janet Reno to appoint a special 
investigator to look into Clinton's role -- as governor of 
Arkansas -- in the Whitewater development company. 
  Critics of the U.S. President's financial misuse say that 
before becoming president, when Clinton was governor of 
Arkansas, he put special government treasury facilities at the 
disposal of the Whitewater company, of which he was a main 
shareholder. That finally resulted in the government losing $60 
million. But the difficulty is that the judiciary must appoint 
a special investigator. The attorney-general is in open 
collaboration with the White House and so far has procrastinated 
in appointing a special investigator to look into the scandal. 
Her pretext is that the legal period for implementing the law 
concerning the appointment of a special investigator by the 
judiciary has expired; whereas the U.S. press say that she has 
other legal authority for a close examination of the issue. The 
collusion between the judiciary -- which carries out justice -- 
and the executive power indicates that both powers are trying 
hard to erase the ignominy of this obvious scandal from the face 
of the U.S. President. 
  The White House earlier announced that as soon as the 
numerous documents concerning Clinton's banking, personal, and 
electoral files are bound they will be handed over to the 
attorney-general's office. Clinton, under increasing political 
pressure two weeks ago, announced that he will be handing over 
documents concerning the financial connection between himself 
and his wife and the Whitewater company in the state of Arkansas 
to the attorney-general's office. But so far he has not handed 
them over. 
  Finally, we point out the fact that U.S. society has always 
been faced with such scandals at the level of political 
administrative authorities. The 1988 U.S. presidential 
candidate, Garry Hart, sometime after the revelations about his 
ethical scandal, said that the personal and private lives of the 
leaders of U.S. society have nothing to do with the people. Now 
it must be asked whether that is merely his point of view or the 
viewpoint of all U.S. statesmen and a permanent principle in 
U.S. diplomacy.

<F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentary Group] </F>
  [Text] According to news reports, the joint U.S.-Pakistani 
maneuvers have commenced in the mountainous areas of the 
[Northwest] Frontier Province. These maneuvers are significant 
in view of the fact that U.S.-Pakistani relations have entered a 
new phase after two years of tension. 
  Pakistan's location in the midst of three countries--India, 
Afghanistan, and Iran--and especially its proximity to the Gulf 
of Oman, the Persian Gulf, and the Indian Ocean, has resulted in 
the United States attaching special importance to this country 
since its independence. 
  As a result of the communist coup d'etat in Afghanistan and 
the subsequent presence of Russian forces in the region, and in 
general a change in the political circumstances in southwest 
Asia, the United States sought to increase its financial and 
military assistance to the erstwhile Pakistani regime on the 
pretext of protecting its interests and combating the 
proliferation of communism. It was for this reason that until 
the end of General Ziaul Haq's tenure, Pakistan was transformed 
into the third largest recipient of U.S. assistance. 
  However, with the lapse of a few years of a continued 
distinctive regional strategy in southwest Asia, the advent of 
certain conditions such as the departure of Russian forces from 
Afghanistan and the establishment of an independent government 
in Pakistan, as well as the end of the Cold War era, the United 
States adopted a new stance on its relations with Pakistan. 
Thus, the importance of Pakistan waned in the U.S. political 
arena. 
  With the emergence of such developments, Washington sought 
to 
bring the military capability of Pakistan in its capacity as a 
powerful Islamic country under control. For this purpose, it 
strove to mobilize world public opinion against Pakistan's 
nuclear capability. Simultaneously, it severed its financial 
and military assistance to Pakistan. 
  During the past one or two months, the two countries have 
taken steps to improve relations. Earlier, with the suspension 
of its assistance to Pakistan, the United States could not 
persuade Islamabad to relinquish its nuclear program and 
Islamabad, which had distanced itself from the United States by 
a change in its foreign policy, sought to get closer to other 
countries, particularly European countries. The vacuum 
resulting from the halt of U.S. financial and military 
assistance was filled by European and non-European countries. 
  As an example, Pakistani experts have investigated 
British-manufactured Tornado fighter planes, Mirage-2000 
aircraft from France, and the Sukhoi-27 and 28 made by Russia on 
their technical aspects. Eventually, the United States, which 
imposed this embargo against Pakistan, lost the lucrative $85 
million market of this country, which would have been of vital 
importance to the insolvent U.S. economy. 
  These strategic considerations motivated the United States 
to 
readjust its hostile policy toward Pakistan, and a month ago 
Clinton proposed a bill for Congressional approval that would 
allow the President to lift embargoes and resume relations with 
certain countries, including Pakistan, for strategic 
considerations. Following its approval, a politico-military 
delegation arrived in Islamabad to iron out differences. Of 
course, Pakistan was inclined to favor improving its relations 
with the United States as it is dependent [vabasteh] on the 
United States regarding its Armed Forces in general, and its Air 
Force in particular, and it is possible that any kind of tension 
in its relations with the United States would result in the 
weakening of its Armed Forces in comparison with those of India. 
  In any case, the joint maneuvers of these two countries, 
which are currently in progress, can be considered as part of 
the process of improving relations between them.

  [Text] Speaking in the open Majles session today, speaker 
Nateq Nuri referred to the establishment of relations between 
Vatican and the Zionist regime and the Pope's recognition of the 
regime. Nateq Nuri said: this act and the approval of crimes 
committed by the regime occupying al-Quds [Jerusalem] was 
expected, but the silence of the Christian community on the 
subject was not. 
  Referring to the Afghan civil war, Nuri said the recent 
events in Afghanistan reveal that Afghan leaders and ringleaders 
lack political maturity, which allows for foreign intervention 
and continued clashes.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "The Christians' Reward to the </F>
Zionists!"] 
  [Text] On the basis of a joint communique that was issued 
yesterday by Israel and the Vatican, an initial agreement on 
establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries was 
approved. This agreement is to be signed today in Jerusalem by 
both sides. 
  The establishment of relations between the Vatican and the 
Israeli regime is actually an about-face by the Christian world, 
which is symbolized by the Vatican, who has suddenly ignored all 
its principles and values and a holy place that is under the 
occupation of Zionist usurpers has been handed over on a silver 
platter to them on behalf of all the Christians of the world. 
  The Pope, as the leader of the Catholic Church in the world 
and who has rewarded the Zionists for the crimes they have 
perpetrated and for their occupation, should be asked by all the 
Christians of the world and by all mankind: Will the noble 
Christians of the world allow the Vatican to reward the Zionist 
traitors and criminals? 
  The Zionist groups in the United States and the Western 
countries have placed the Vatican under pressure to compromise 
with the Israeli regime. But this will only lead to further 
discord and disagreement in Europe and will definitely give rise 
to insecurity and protests there. Pious Christians will never 
agree to this compromise. The Christians of the world should 
prove that this is not a reward by the Christian world to the 
Zionists, but a reward that has been handed out by the corrupt 
club of the powerful who rule the West.

<F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentary Group] </F>
  [Text] Three days of intensive talks between the 
representatives of the PLO headed by Faruq Qaddumi, the head of 
the PLO political bureau, and the Jordanian delegation headed by 
Deputy Prime Minister Sa'id al-Tall in Amman concluded with the 
signing of a joint communique by the two sides yesterday. 
  This communique specifies all the areas of cooperation in 
political, economic, and security matters between Jordan and 
Palestine following the establishment of Palestinian rule under 
the Gaza-Jericho autonomy accord. The implementation of a major 
part of the elements depends on the implementation of the 
Gaza-Jericho accord, which is now rather ambiguous as a result 
of differences between the PLO and Israel. 
  With this accord, Jordan has consolidated its future 
position 
in the autonomous regions. Recently, as a result of an 
agreement between Jordan and Israel, Jordanian banks are seeking 
to resume activities in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
The activities of these banks had been suspended following the 
usurpation of these areas in the six-day Arab-Israeli war in 
1967. Besides, the Jordanian dinar is currently circulating in 
these areas alongside the Zionist regime's currency, the shekel. 
In view of the fact that one-third of Jordanian currency is 
circulating in these areas, Amman does not wish to relinquish 
this sector of its economic activity. 
  The consolidation of the Jordanian dinar and the banking 
activities of this country in the occupied areas of the West 
Bank and the Gaza Strip has been affirmed with the signing of 
this agreement. In conjunction with economic agreements, 
committees on the issues of Jerusalem, refugees, homeless 
persons, security, borders, and social affairs have been 
envisaged in this agreement. PLO-Jordanian talks commenced a few 
days after King Husayn's vehement criticism of 'Arafat and the 
PLO. King Husayn described these talks as the last chance for 
coordination of relations between Palestine and Jordan. 
  Political observers believe that Jordan's insistence on this 
agreement stems from numerous factors, most importantly that 
Jordan is concerned that 'Arafat is giving preference to 
coordination and cooperation with Israel even at the expense of 
adversely affecting cooperation with Jordan. In view of the 
considerable number of Palestinians living in Jordan, which 
exceeds half of the country's population, Jordan is greatly 
affected by these developments. In fact, 'Arafat's regional 
cooperation with Israel undermines Jordan's historical role. 
What is interesting in this matter is the regional rivalry over 
the economic future of autonomous Gaza and Jericho without any 
clear picture of the actual situation.

<F P=106> [Hasan Fathi commentary: "The Beirut Explosion: A Blow to </F>
Peace"] 
  [Excerpts] At a time when the political situation in 
Lebanon is tense because of differences between President Ilyas 
al-Hirawi and Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, a truck loaded 
with 250 kg of explosives was blown up in al-Sayfi region in 
East Beirut near the Phalangist Party headquarters killing three 
and wounding 200. [passage omitted] 
  In regard to this incident, the Lebanese defense minister 
said that this was not an act only against the Phalangist Party 
but against Lebanon's security and tranquility as well. Almost 
all the parties, groups, and personalities who condemned the 
explosion agreed that this incident has threatened peace in 
Lebanon and could lead to a fresh round of clashes from which 
Lebanon had been free for some time. In 1975 after the 
Phalangists' attack on a bus carrying Palestinians in 'Ayn 
al-Rummanah region in Beirut, Lebanon became the scene of a 
civil war that lasted for 15 years. This war, which put the 
Phalangists on one side and Palestinian, national, and Islamic 
groups on the other, paved the way for Syrian and Israeli 
interventions in Lebanon, so much so that Israel attacked 
Lebanon several times and ultimately occupied part of southern 
Lebanon, which continues to be occupied by Israel and its allies. 
  The Syrian forces which came to Lebanon as peacekeeping 
forces now control the pulse of the country's affairs, and the 
Lebanese Government is unable to make any decisions without 
their being confirmed and approved in Damascus. [passage omitted] 
  The explosion at the Phalangist Party headquarters has given 
rise to the fear that the situation will once again change and 
that clashes will once again resume precisely at a time when all 
efforts are being aimed at preventing such clashes, since none 
of the parties or groups want to see the situation return to 
what it was before.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Future Efforts"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Five years after the crash of a Pan American 
airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, the Zionist-influenced mass 
media has started fresh efforts to involve Iran in the issue. 
  The most important document that the Western mass media 
refers to is based on former American spy Lester Coleman's 
allegations that since former British Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher implies in her book of memoirs that Libya is innocent, 
therefore Iran is the main culprit in the explosion. [passage 
omitted] 
  In weaving their tale, the Western press also alleges that 
since the condenser on the time bomb used on the Pan American 
aircraft was similar to a condenser that was sold to East 
Germany by a Swiss company in 1985--three years before the 
Lockerbie explosion--and since Ahmad Jibril--whom they believe 
to be responsible for the crash--had good relations with East 
Germany, Iran, and Syria, therefore Tehran and Damascus are 
directly involved in the incident. [passage omitted] 
  On the basis of Zionist propaganda, the Islamic Republic of 
Iran and Syria are the main elements behind the American plane 
crash; and according to this propaganda, the reason why Iran and 
Syria have not been prosecuted as the main culprits so far is 
because this has not been deemed politically advisable because 
the United States needed Syria in the war against Iraq and it 
now needs Syria to advance the Middle East peace plan. 
Therefore, this is why only Libya was the target of American 
anger and UN sanctions. [passage omitted] 
  Political observers believe that the current propaganda is 
directly linked with the Islamic Republic's defense of the 
aspirations of the Palestinian people and that the fresh Zionist 
propaganda against Iran after a five-year silence should be 
discussed within the context of the intensification of the 
Palestinian people's struggles and the continuation of the 
Intifadah in the occupied territories. 
  The United States and world Zionism have always considered 
Iran to be the main obstacle to the Middle East peace talks. 
Also, the United States considers its major regional policy to 
be the isolation of Iran and the portrayal of an ugly and harsh 
face of Iran so that the way can be paved for isolating Iran on 
the one hand and for perpetrating numerous crimes on the other, 
especially when one analyzes the downing of the Iranian 
passenger plane over the Persian Gulf. [passage omitted] 
  Apparently the Americans intend to pave the way for more 
instigations in the region through the contrivance of their 
agents. But the American statesmen should not forget the 
disgrace they have suffered in Somalia.

  [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has termed 
the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia-Herzegovina as a terrible stain 
on the conscience of mankind and urged the world community to 
focus their attention on the plight and suffering of the Bosnian 
people. She was addressing a joint news conference along with 
the visiting prime minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Dr. Haris 
Silajdzic, in Karachi today. The prime minister in her 
statement said: 
  [Begin Bhutto recording] [Words indistinct] we feel strongly 
about Bosnia, not only because we are Muslims. We feel strongly 
about Bosnia because we believe in freedom, we believe in human 
rights, and we believe in the sanctity of life. The rape of 
Bosnian women, the death of Bosnian men, the plight of Bosnian 
orphanages [as heard] is not just the rape of Bosnia, of the 
killings in Bosnia, of the plight of the children of Bosnia. It 
is indeed the rape of the world's conscience, the killing of the 
world's conscience, and it is a common plight of the world 
itself. I would like to take advantage of the visit of the 
prime minister of Bosnia to assure him that Pakistan stands 
fully behind his government and it's efforts to end the killing 
in Bosnia and the suffering of the people of Bosnia. We are 
prepared to assist in every effort within Pakistan and without 
at international forums to bring an end to what we call a stain 
on the conscience of mankind. [end recording] 
  Speaking at the news conference, the Bosnian prime minister 
said: 
  [Begin Silajdzic recording] I am certain that Pakistani 
Government will continue supporting us at bilateral and 
international forums. Pakistan is a prominent supporter of our 
cause in the United Nations, in the Organization of Islamic 
Countries [as heard] and other international forums. A 
Pakistani is a member of the war crimes tribunal. And that is 
all shall the support of Pakistan to us. [sentence as heard] 
[end recording] 
  Earlier, when the prime minister of Bosnia flew into Karachi 
from Islamabad on the last leg of his three day's visit to 
Pakistan, he was received by the prime minister. Also present 
to receive the distinguished guest was the Sindh chief minister, 
Syed Abdullah Shah, and the defense minister, Mr. Aftab Shaban 
Mirani. Dr. Haris Silajdzic was then introduced to the speaker 
of the Sindh assembly, Mr. Ghaus Bux Meher; members of the Sindh 
cabinet; senior officials of the provincial government; and 
members of the diplomatic corps based in Karachi. The Bosnian 
prime minister was accompanied by the federal minister for law 
and parliamentary affairs, Syed Iqbal Haider, and ambassador of 
Bosnia in Pakistan, Mrs. Seljida. The Bosnian prime minister 
and Ms. Benazir Bhutto then proceeded to the VVIP [Very Very 
Important Person] room and had a brief exchange of views on the 
latest situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Thousands of people have left Kabul for safer 
places, and fresh fighting has erupted there after a 30-hour 
cease-fire. Radio Pakistan's Peshawar correspondent reports that 
about 5,000 Afghan nationals have crossed over to Pakistan since 
the fighting erupted on New Year's Day. More than 60 diplomats 
and UN mission personnel arrived in Peshawar before the latest 
resumption of fighting. These diplomats belong to Saudi Arabia, 
Iran, Libya, Turkey, India, Sudan, and Somalia. They have 
temporarily closed their missions in Kabul. At least 15,000 
have fled Kabul during the cease-fire to take shelter in 
Jalalabad. The influx of more people into Jalalabad continues. 
  A spokesman of Afghanistan's Nigrar-e Jehad-e Shura told the 
Radio Pakistan correspondent that arrangements are being made to 
settle refugees in camps near Jalalabad. He said the Pakistan 
Government has sent food and other items for the settlement. An 
emergency meeting presided over by the UN High Commission for 
Refugees was held in Peshawar, and reviewed the settlement 
arrangements of the new refugees. The meeting was told that 
teams have been sent to Jalalabad to assess the needs of the 
refugees. The meeting, which was attended by officials of the UN 
High Commission for Refugees, was told that the Pakistan 
Government will extend all possible help to the non-governmental 
agencies to send essential items to Jalalabad. 
  Meanwhile, reports from Kabul say Fort Bala Hissar and the 
Microryan District are centers of the latest fighting. These 
are the strongholds of the forces under General Abdul Rashid 
Dostam. Two people were killed while fleeing Microryan on 
bicycles when they tried to cross a bridge separating the 
warring factions.

  [Text] The interior minister, retired Major General 
Nasirullah Khan Babar, informed the Senate today that Pakistani 
troops have been sent to Somalia in accordance with the UN 
resolutions to restore peace and food supplies in that country. 
He was speaking on the admissibility of two identical 
adjournment motions sought to be moved by Professor Khurshid 
Ahmed and Syed Safi Iqbal about sending of additional troops to 
Somalia. He clarified that Pakistani forces are part of the 
United Nations peacekeeping force. They are performing a 
humanitarian task in Somalia and would come back as soon as this 
task has been completed. 
  The interior minister said Pakistan wants to play a historic 
role for peace in the world under UN mandate. The minister said 
Pakistan is also sending troops to Haiti to supervise elections. 
Pakistan has also expressed its willingness to send troops to 
Bosnia if asked by the United Nations. 
  The chairman ruled the motion out of order.

  [Excerpt] Islamabad -- Federal Interior Minister Maj. 
General (Retd) [Retired] Naseerullah Babar admitted on Sunday [9 
January] that Pakistan was sending 2,500 troops in addition to 
the 5,000 already in Somalia "for restoring peace and food 
supply in strife-torn brotherly country." 
  He was responding to identical adjournment motions moved by 
Prof. Khursheed and Fasih Iqbal on Sunday. The General 
categorically said, "our troops have been sent to Somalia in 
accordance with the United Nation [as published] resolutions." 
  Speaking on the admissibility of the motion, the Minister 
said that because of the peace keeping operation peace had been 
restored to a great extent in Somalia apart from regular food 
supplies. "We want to play an historic role in peace-keeping 
under the UN mandate," he said proudly. 
  He dispelled the impression that the Pakistan forces were 
under the US command. "They are part of the UN peace keeping 
force. I am proud to say that our troops are performing a 
humanitarian task in Somalia and would come back as soon as this 
task is accomplished." 
  He informed the House that Pakistan was also sending troops 
to Haiti to monitor elections. Pakistan had also expressed its 
willingness to send troops in Bosnia if asked by the UN. 
  Earlier, Prof Khurshid, speaking on the motion, apprehending 
that Pakistan was being instrumental in watching US interests. 
He said the US was exceeding from the mandate it was given by 
the UN. "The Americans want to maintain hegemony in African 
countries like Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya. 
  He expressed his sorrow over the martyrdom of 33 Pakistani 
soldiers recently, saying, "It's all for US interests." [passage

<F P=106> [By Shameem Akhtar: "Benazir's Journey to the East"] </F>
  [Text] Benazir's journey to the East -- China and North 
Korea -- against the backdrop of sanctions against Pakistan and 
the People's Republic of China and Washington's siege of the 
DPRK has regional and global significance. The three have 
outrightly rejected hegemonism and have given expression to 
their shared perception of an international order based on 
respect for sovereign equality of all states, non-intervention, 
peaceful co-existence, peaceful settlement of disputes. 
  With one voice Benazir, Li Peng and Kim Il-song denounced 
the 
political and economic domination of the developing countries by 
the big powers, and asked them to live and let others live. In 
fact, the above-named countries have been subjected to punitive 
diplomacy and blackmail by the US for the simple reason that 
they have embarked upon a path of independent economic 
development. Pakistan has been accused of having made the 
Islamic bomb, and DPRK a Marxist bomb while China has been 
charged with supplying 400-metre-range M-11 missiles to Pakistan. 
  Pakistan has offered to conclude the NPT [Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty] together with India. The DPRK has 
proposed the establishment of nuclear-weapons-free zone in the 
Korean peninsula, meaning the removal of 1000 nuclear and lethal 
weapons from there by the US. Further, it has to remove 48000 
troops from South Korea, another 45000 troops from Japan and 
warships from the Korean waters. This Washington is not 
prepared to do and insists on Pyongyong's unconditional 
submission to the inspection by the so-called IAEA 
[International Atomic Energy Agency] team of North Korea's two 
suspected nuclear sites. The row had taken a serious turn, with 
President Clinton threatening to bomb Pyongyong's nuclear 
installations. Benazir has sought to defuse the tension by 
lending support to the ongoing negotiations between the US and 
the DPRK at the United Nations, and pleading that 
non-proliferation should not be made a pretext for blocking the 
acquisition of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. 
Apparently, Pakistan's role has had some sobering influence on 
the adversaries. 
  Both Pakistan and China have categorically denied the M-11 
missile deal amidst Washington's refrain that Beijing had made 
the delivery to its neighbour. China has made it clear that it 
gives weapons for the recipient country's self-defiance [as 
published] only and not to create imbalance in South Asia. 
There is nothing clandestine about Pakistan-China arms transfer 
which began, it may be recalled, after the US stopped military 
assistance to Islamabad after the Sino-Soviet border agreement 
in 1963. In December 1989 the two neighbours reached an 
agreement for cooperation in the production of arms and 
ammunition. Pakistan has to do something about its defence 
since Rajiv Gandhi did not respond to Benazir's proposal for a 
mutual balanced reduction of forces. Nor to her predecessor 
government's offer of no-war pact. India is ever after a 
deadlier weapons such as Agni, Prithvi, Akash missiles in 
addition to four rocket launchers given to it by Russia. 
  Benazir has been mobilising world opinion in favour of a 
judicious settlement of Kashmir where insurgency might spill 
over into neighbouring countries, triggering off a regional war 
in which Afghanistan and Iran may be embroiled at some stage 
similar to Muslim Ummah's involvement against Russians in 
Afghanistan. In the '60s and '70s, the People's Republic of 
China unreservedly back the solution of Kashmir problem on the 
basis of the UN-sponsored plebiscite. The Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin particularly mentioned that the Kashmir dispute was 
the main obstacle to the normalisation of relations between 
India and Pakistan. 
  At the same time the Chinese leaders avoided taking sides 
presumably because any partisan attitude on their part would 
deprive them of whatever influence they might bring to bear upon 
India by quiet diplomacy. Any offer of mediation by Beijing 
would not be acceptable to India which insists on bilateral 
negotiations. Astute diplomats as they are, the Chinese denied 
assuming any such role. It is by some semblance of 
even-handedness and nonpartisanship that Beijing can exercise a 
moderating influence on India. Certainly, China will never 
allow India to invade Pakistan, especially when the Soviet Union 
is no longer there to neutralise Beijing. 
  Kim Il-song has maintained his government's support to the 
settlement of Kashmir dispute on the basis of the will of the 
people expressed through an impartial referendum, a position 
adopted in consultation with Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in 1976. 
Unlike China, the DPRK has no unresolved disputes with India 
and does not have to toe a cautious line. Therefore, 
Pyongyang's partisanship would not complicate the matter but add 
to the moral weight of Pakistan's stand. 
  Alone among the UN members Pakistan has stood by China on 
human rights issue as proclaimed by Benazir that her government 
shares Beijing's perception on that score. The United States 
has left no stone unturned in making pariah of China on the 
suppression of the West-inspired subversion at Tiananmen Square 
in June 1989. Day in and day out, the Western media keep 
playing up the so-called Tibetan separatism in a bid to fuel 
insurgency in China's Himalayan province while the British 
governor of the crown colony of Hong Kong is busy sowing the 
dragon's seed there which he calls representatives assembly. It 
is ridiculous -- nay mischievous -- to plant a state within 
state on the eve of the lapse of Britain's paramountcy in the 
region. Similarly, the Western powers have been arming Taiwan, 
a part of mainland China, to teeth so that that entity may 
resist reunion with the parent country. 
  Pakistan's Prime Minister has strongly opposed the Western 
designs on China's territorial integrity and endorsed its 
inalienable sovereign right to Tibet, Hong Kong and Taiwan, a 
gesture that was appreciated by the Chinese government and 
people. Pakistani leader underlined the need for strengthening 
that United Nations in order to enable it to contribute to the 
establishment of an international order based on justice. The 
nonaligned nations could effectively resist the hegemonistic and 
exploitative role of the big powers that impedes the emergence 
of global egalitarianism. But the NAM [Nonaligned Movement] has 
been stuck by paralysis in the post-cold war years. 
  The December 15 GATT document is discriminatory against the 
developing countries as it imposes an unequal trade regime on 
them all. More galling is the pusillanimous submission on the 
part of NAM which had been crying hoarse for market access in 
the developed world. India's half-hearted call for G-15 Summit 
to address the GATT met with equally half-hearted response. The 
summit could never meet. Nor was Narasimha Rao serious about 
countering the domineering North with whose multinationals he 
has been hobnobbing. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, India 
has been placating the imperialist-zionist lobby for a permanent 
seat in the Security Council. Whither NAM? 
  In this context the meeting of the leaders of Pakistan, 
China 
and the DPRK has been particularly significant in that they have 
been resisting attempted subjugation from armed plutocratic 
powers. At this critical juncture Kim Il-song's advice aimed at 
South-South cooperation is significant. The great Korean leader 
argues that Asia is blessed with immense natural resources, 
manpower, technical know-how and experience. Given meaningful 
cooperation, all these could be turned to good account. The 
People's Republic of China and the DPRK are living examples of 
development through self- reliance. Pakistan has forged 
multiple economic, trade and technological links with the both 
and has been expanding the cooperation. Benazir has laid stress 
on energy, agriculture and irrigation where Chinese assistance 
is urgently required. She has invited the Chinese entrepreneurs 
to invest in Pakistan where the government's economic reforms 
and new financing modes will facilitate joint ventures in 
collaboration with local investors. 
  Five accords were signed: 
  (1) bilateral cooperation in science and technology, (2) 
transport, (3) twinning of Punjab and Xian provinces, (4) 
border trade agreement which raised the volume of such trade to 
2 million Yuan, and (5) an 80-million-yuan soft loan to 
Pakistan. China has helped Pakistan set up heavy mechanical 
complex, heavy forge foundry and aircraft rebuild factory. It 
is about time that attention was paid to light industry in 
private sector on the basis of joint ventures. This was agreed 
at a meeting of the 6-member Chinese delegation led by Zeng 
Xianlin, Minister for Light Industry and Pakistan's Minister of 
Production, Islam Nabi, at Islamabad in September '91. The 
Chinese official opined that light industry could be established 
with small capital and fetch foreign exchange which in turn 
could be invested in defence sector. 
  Among the areas identified for the purpose are the 
manufacturing of electrical fans, air-conditioners, electrical 
equipments, auto-bicycles, elevators, hand-operated deep well 
pumps and food processing. In addition to making Pakistan 
self-sufficient in engineering goods, the industry will create 
jobs. Some of these products could be exported to China, 
thereby reducing Pakistan's trade deficit. In 1991, China 
exported goods to Pakistan amounting to US$598 million while 
Pakistan's export was mere US$89.2 million. The balance is more 
or less the same at present. Improved communication links and 
exchange of visits by businessmen can promote trade via land 
route. It is a good news to the traders that both the 
governments have decided to repair and develop Karakoram Highway 
into an all-weather road. 
  Similarly, there exists great potential in promoting 
cooperation with the DPRK in trade and development. Already, 
Pyongyong has extended technical assistance in establishing 
hydro-power station in Azad Kashmir. It has offered to assist 
Pakistan in seismic-proof pre-fabricated housing, manufacture of 
generators and mining equipment. North Korea's long-standing 
offer to construct underground railway system to solve the 
nation's chronic mass transit problem must still be open if only 
we could avail of it. The DPRK will also buy chemical products 
from Pakistan. 
  These are examples of mutually advantageous economic and 
technical cooperation in bilateral relations among the states of 
the South. Pakistan, China and the DPRK have shown how states 
with differing political, social and economic systems, can work 
together in a rewarding fellowship.

  [Text] Karachi -- At least ten people, including a 
sub-divisional magistrate [SDM], his guard and an army jawan 
[soldier], were injured and 28 vehicles damaged when a powerful 
time-device went off in the parking lot of the city courts 
Saturday [8 January]. The bomb was planted in a Vespa scooter 
parked near the office of the Deputy Commissioner, South. 
  Eyewitnesses said the police activity and presence of the 
mobile control room of the fire brigade in the court prior to 
the explosion showed that the administration had information 
about planting of the bomb. 
  "I was in the court stamp office around 12:15 pm when I 
heard 
a big explosion and felt as if the building was going to cave in 
and my ears kept buzzing for a few minutes", Nastz Rizwan, 
Advocate, told THE NEWS. He said after few seconds several other 
explosions of mild intensity were heard compelling him to remain 
in the office. 
  By the time three fire brigades reached the scene, most of 
the motorcycles had already been gutted. The splinters of the 
bomb as well as pieces of Vespa broke the window panes and went 
high to the top of a multi-storey building across the road. 
  "SDM airport, Iqbal Scomro, had arrived minutes before the 
explosion and was talking to chauffeur of the chief secretary 
when the explosion took place and we were hit by heavy objects", 
said guard of the SDM, Haider Abhas, at the Civil Hospital. 
  Ameer Abdullah, a policeman who was also injured, said he 
was 
going to the court after when the device exploded and an object 
hit at his right shoulder, "I fell unconscious and know nothing 
what happened later,", he said. Another injured Bahauddin, an 
aged Baloch, was hit by an heavy object while sitting behind the 
stamp office. He was sitting about half a furlong from the 
parking lot. His condition was stated to be unstable. 
  Other injured were identified as (Mumtazur) Rehman, an army 
personnel, Nasir Khan, Abdul Rehman, Taufeeq Moin, Mohammad 
Aslam, Mohammad Musaddiq and Abdul Rehman who were treated and 
discharged from the Civil Hospital. 
  The Incharge of the Bomb Disposal Service, Moinuddin, said: 
"It was 400 grams of Russian made TNT explosive covered with 
steel splinters and attached with a console timer of 
approximately 30-minute." 
  The timer was also Russian-made, but the current detonator 
could be home-made which was attached with a 9-volt battery, he 
added. 
  When asked DSP [Deputy Inspector of Police] Eidgah, Chaudhri 
Mohammad Ashraf, said: "The incident seems to be connected with 
the recent incident of Larkana." SDM Arambagh, Raeesuddin 
Piracha, who was also holding the charge of Eidgah Sub-Division, 
said hands of AZO [Al-Zulfiqar Organization) and RAW [Research 
and Analysis Wing] could not be ruled out. 
  The DIG [Deputy Inspector General] Karachi, Rahood Khan 
Brohi, however, said: "We cannot say anything as the matter was 
yet to be investigated. Special teams have been formed under 
the supervision of the area DSP [Deputy Superintendent of 
Police] which will be assisted by the CIA. [Crime Investigation 
Agency]" 
  He denied any arrest in this connection so far and said 
hopefully the investigators would reach a conclusion after the 
microscopic examination of the splinters and pieces of the Vespa.

  [Text] Holy Mecca, 7 Jan [date as received] -- The Islamic 
World League has expressed deep regret at the continuation of 
in-fighting between the Afghan leaderships, calling on them to 
turn toward reconstructing their country and resolving the 
problems of their people that were created by years of the 
defeated communist rule. 
  In a statement released today, it emphasized the necessity 
to 
solve all internal conflicts in Afghanistan according to the 
principles of Islamic law, so that everyone will then be devoted 
to the construction of the country that was destroyed by war, 
and in order that the Afghan Muslim people would reap the fruits 
of jihad for God's cause and would set [the Afghan people] an 
example for others in sacrifice, selflessness, and the rise 
above personal disputes. 
  The statement saw that what was happening between the 
brothers in Afghanistan will leave the door wide open for the 
colonialist powers and the remnants of infidelity who are lying 
in wait for this Muslim country. 
  The statement recalled the expression of concern of the 
Constituent Council of the League, at its recently held session, 
over the continued armed conflicts in Afghanistan and its appeal 
to the warring parties to abide by the principles of Islam, to 
cast away personal disputes, to rise above private interest, to 
work toward ensuring the security, stability, and safety of the 
Muslim people of Afghanistan, and to seek the arbitration of 
neutral Muslim ulema to solve the conflict and remove its causes.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by </F>
Yaron Ben-'Ami and political correspondent Udi Segal on the 
weekly "In the Current Situation" program; on 7 
January--recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Ben-'Ami] Mr. Rabin, do King 
Husayn's statements about the possibility of a parting of the 
ways with the PLO and separate Jordanian-Israeli negotiations 
create a new situation? If that is indeed the case, how does 
Israel propose to handle things? 
  [Rabin] We are trying to establish a dialogue with every 
Arab party to the negotiations on the basis of the Madrid peace 
conference and the continuation of the talks in Washington. We 
do not create any sort of linkage between progress with one Arab 
partner out of the four we are negotiating with. I am referring 
to Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and the Palestinians. We will make 
progress with anyone prepared to talk to us with whom we can 
find a common language, without this being conditional on the 
state of the negotiations with the other Arab partners. 
However, it is worth remembering one thing: There is a 
fundamental difference in the negotiations between us and the 
three neighboring Arab countries, with whom we seek to sign a 
peace treaty, and the negotiations with the Palestinians. The 
Declaration of Principles is not a peace treaty, it is merely an 
important step toward peace. The title of the paper signed in 
Washington faithfully reflects the nature of the agreement 
itself: It is an agreement on an interim accord. We still use 
old terminology and call it autonomy while the Palestinians and 
the formal documents at the Madrid conference and afterwards 
speak of arrangements for Palestinian self-rule. 
  [Segal] Does King Husayn's declaration of a possible parting 
of the ways with the PLO perhaps pave the way for a 
Jordanian-Palestinian confederation in the permanent settlement? 
Is this not cause for concern? What is Israel's attitude 
toward this move? 
  [Rabin] At the moment we are negotiating a peace treaty with 
three Arab countries and holding talks on an interim settlement 
with the Palestinians. The Israeli Government has reached no 
decision on a confederation with Jordan in the permanent 
arrangement. According to international terminology, a 
confederation is a framework incorporating two states. Anyone 
caring to read the Labor Party's election platform and the 
decisions made at its latest convention will see that there is 
no mention of a Palestinian state between Israel and Jordan. 
Therefore, any attempt to deal with issues pertaining to the 
permanent solution now are wrong. We oppose the Palestinian 
attempt to raise elements of the permanent solution for 
discussion in the course of negotiations on the Gaza-Jericho 
First proposal, which is merely the first step in the interim 
stage. We firmly and clearly insist on one thing: the 
negotiations today are over the interim accord. Both sides must 
keep all their options open for the negotiations on the 
permanent solution. All the wisdom and logic in reaching an 
interim agreement first lies in the attempt to examine whether 
Palestinians and Israelis can achieve peaceful coexistence in 
Judaea and Samaria. Until we experience whether or not this is 
possible, it would be a mistake on our part today to deal with 
elements of the permanent solution or to allow the Palestinians 
to raise issues pertaining to the permanent arrangement, such as 
for example, the refugee issue. At this stage of negotiations 
on the interim arrangement, we are not dealing with the issue of 
refugees, whether these are Palestinian refugees or Jewish 
refugees from the Arab countries. 
  [Segal] At a meeting of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and 
Defense Committee two weeks ago, Knesset Member [MK] Binyamin 
Netanyahu pulled out an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Intelligence 
Branch document warning about the security risks posed by 
autonomy. Your reaction was, and I quote: With all due respect 
to the IDF Intelligence Branch, it has been wrong in the past 
and these are merely assessments. Sir, do you believe that when 
the PLO assumes responsibility we will be able to count on them? 
Can 'Arafat guarantee security and deal with the terrorist 
squads? 
  [Rabin] Let us separate the substantive part of your 
question and its introductory sentence. At the Knesset Foreign 
Affairs and Defense Committee session, MK Netanyahu did, indeed, 
mention an IDF Intelligence Branch document which I had not yet 
seen. I replied that it was the Intelligence Branch's job to 
present the dangers. I never concealed the fact that any 
political move carried out by Israel entails some risks. Giving 
up all of the Sinai Peninsula and erasing all signs of an 
Israeli presence there also engendered danger. Not only 
security risks, it also set a precedent regarding the price 
Israel would have to pay in exchange for peace with other 
countries. It is the political echelon, however, which makes 
the decisions. As for the assessments of the Intelligence 
Branch, whether right or wrong as it occasionally transpires, 
there is the example of the Yom Kippur War which proves that 
mistakes have been made, perhaps not in overrating dangers but 
rather in underestimating them. Now back to your question. 
First of all, Israel retains responsibility for the security of 
Israeli citizens and for external security. True, in the 
situation which we hope will ensue, the Palestinians in the Gaza 
Strip, for example, will control the areas of Gaza city with 
over 250,000 Palestinian residents. Clearly, in order to 
control such a population -- and because we do not want to place 
any Israeli soldiers or policemen at risk -- there will have to 
be a Palestinian police force which will be armed with rifles, 
not sticks. They will not receive their arms from Israel but 
from another source. All the talk about Israel arming the 
Palestinian police is simply being fabricated by various 
elements who are trying to mislead the public with baseless 
lies. There must be a strong police force. This was already 
promised -- and I believe rightly so -- by an Israeli prime 
minister way back at Camp David. I also think that there should 
be a strong police force. This police force must take control 
of the street because if it fails to do so, or if it does not 
receive strict instructions to impose law and order, the basis 
for the whole agreement will be undermined. 
  [Ben-'Ami] Security problems can also arise from the other 
end. What about the settlers' riots and the calls for 
insubordination inside the IDF? What about the letter by the 
reserve officers? 
  [Rabin] Let me start off by saying that I consider 
insubordination within the IDF to be totally unacceptable. I 
was also opposed to it during the Lebanon war. Even if the 
public was divided, a democratically elected government has the 
authority to tell the IDF what to do and no soldier has the 
right to refuse an order. There is nothing worse than calling 
for insubordination. I find it inconceivable for a soldier to 
refuse to serve in the territories. There were many cases of 
soldiers who refused to serve in the territories because the 
military occupation of another people was contradictory to their 
political beliefs. It is just as inconceivable for soldiers to 
refuse any orders except for what the Supreme Court defines as 
manifestly illegal orders which contravene the humane and legal 
values we seek to instill in our soldiers. 
  [Ben-'Ami] What about the settlers' terror activities? 
  [Rabin] If such things happen, God forbid, it will be 
Israel's responsibility to deal with it, just as we shall demand 
that the Palestinian police deal with Palestinian terrorists in 
the areas under the control of the Palestinian police. 
  [Segal] Sir, was the release of 101 Palestinian prisoners 
part of a deal with the PLO to renew the Taba talks? Are 
further releases of Palestinian prisoners expected in the coming 
days? 
  [Rabin] No one informed the PLO of the decision to release 
over 100 prisoners. I was responsible for this decision. I 
would like to reiterate our criteria: None of these prisoners 
belonged to the rejectionist groups which continue terrorist 
activity, none of them has any Jewish or Palestinian blood on 
their hands, and most of them were due to be released soon 
anyway. I would like to remind everyone that Israel is holding 
between 9,000 and 9,600 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. 
These are mostly prisoners or detainees still undergoing legal 
proceedings. These prisoners are held in IDF lockups or in 
Prison Service installations. On average, over 300 prisoners 
are released each month when their sentence is completed or when 
the administrative detention of about 130 or 140 prisoners out 
of the 9,000 expires. The remainder have either been convicted 
or are undergoing legal proceedings. We did not release any 
prisoner or detainee still undergoing legal proceedings. 
Approximately 200 to 300 prisoners are released each month 
anyway. 
  [Ben-'Ami] Sir, you were in favor of negotiating with Syria 
first. In a week President Clinton will meet with Syrian 
President al-Asad. Do you expect a change in Israel's 
relationship with Syria? Do you foresee a possibility of the 
Syrian track taking priority over the negotiations with the 
Palestinians? 
  [Rabin] First of all, I would like to correct what you said. 
I have always stressed the need to focus on the 
Palestinian-Israeli issue, at least since the last election 
campaign and after becoming prime minister. If you watch the 
television reports on our election campaign you will see that we 
placed the focus on the Palestinian track and I even announced a 
timetable of six to nine months that we failed to meet. We 
failed to meet the target date but we reached an agreement with 
the Palestinians. I always said that the key for a breakthrough 
is in the hands of two of our four Arab partners: either Syria 
or the Palestinians. Why is this? I always realized that 
Jordan cannot -- without getting into the reasons for this now 
-- lead a breakthrough. Lebanon, which, putting things nicely, 
is very much under Syria's influence, is definitely incapable of 
such a move. Therefore, the key to any breakthrough is either 
Syria or the Palestinians. We reached a declaration of 
principles and we are conducting negotiations with the 
Palestinians. I will not say things are easier. There have 
been ups and downs, as I said there would be immediately after 
signing the agreement in Washington. As for the Syrians, I have 
still not received an answer to my question. I said earlier that 
the goal of our negotiations with the neighboring Arab countries 
was a peace treaty, not some other agreement. To the best of my 
knowledge, Syria, up to this very moment, has not explained that 
its interpretation of the term peace is similar to the way we 
understand it. In other words, borders that are open to the 
traffic of goods and people, diplomatic relations and embassies, 
a policy of normalization, and a peace treaty between our two 
countries that is independent and not effected by our relations 
with other Arab partners. I would not be wrong to say that up 
to now, the Syrians have been demanding a full withdrawal and 
the dismantlement of all Jewish settlements on the Golan Heights 
in exchange for a peace that does not even include 
normalization. Al-Asad constantly insists he will not be 
willing to accept anything less than was accepted by the late 
Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat. In other words, Israel's 
return to the international border, the evacuation of all of the 
Sinai and the uprooting of any Israeli presence there. Al-Asad 
insists that this is a precedent for making peace, and he is 
adamant not to receive less even in return for a less extensive 
peace. At this stage, we have not received a full answer 
regarding what kind of peace President al-Asad is referring to, 
and we have certainly not accepted the price he is asking in 
return for peace. We have accepted the principle of withdrawal 
on the Golan Heights to secure and recognized borders. We said 
we would not enter negotiations on the geographical dimensions 
of withdrawal until we know what kind of peace we are getting in 
return. As for what will happen at the al- Asad-Clinton summit 
on 16 January, why should I guess? We only have to wait nine 
days to find out. 
  [Segal] Washington pundits believe that the Syrian president 
will clearly explain his concept of peace with Israel. 
According to some assessments, he will propose full peace with 
embassies and open borders. According to your own formula of 
full peace in exchange for full withdrawal, are you today 
capable of passing a decision on withdrawal from the Golan 
Heights? 
  [Rabin] Up to today, when defining Israel's position, I have 
never spoken of full withdrawal. If that becomes a problem, we 
shall have to discuss it. Our position today is in support of a 
withdrawal on the Golan Heights. 
  [Segal] Given today's political situation, can you gain a 
majority for such a decision? 
  [Rabin] For a withdrawal on the Golan Heights? Yes.

  [Text] Al-Masna', Lebanon, Jan 10 (AFP)--A US congressional 
team swept into Lebanon in a heavily guarded motorcade on Monday 
[10 January] to search for clues to the fate of six missing 
Israeli servicemen, an AFP correspondent reported. 
  They arrived from Damascus in US embassy cars and crossed at 
this border post, 80 kilometres (50 miles) east of Beirut, which 
was guarded by 50 Lebanese troops. 
  The motorcade, flanked by 10 jeeps carrying members of the 
Lebanese army's special forces, then headed for the nearby 
village al-Sultan Ya'qub, where three Israeli soldiers went 
missing during a battle with the Syrians in 1982. 
  Syria agreed in December to assist the congressional team to 
try to shed light on the fate of the six men, a move Israel 
hailed as a step forward for the peace process. 
  Only airman Ron Arad is believed to be still alive. 
  The Americans met families of the missing men in Israel on 
Thursday, and had talks in Damascus on Saturday with Syrian 
Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar'.

  [Text] Speaking to reporters at Nandial yesterday, Mr. 
Narasimha Rao said the government is taking all steps necessary 
to combat terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir and that elections will 
be held there once a conducive atmosphere prevails. 
  [Begin Rao recording] I said we will have to deal with 
terrorism, transborder terrorism, exported terrorism, all that 
is going on there. We have to control it, create conditions of 
law and order so that we could proceed toward a democratic 
process, which that particular state has not had for some time. 
[end recording] 
  Political activity has gained momentum in Jammu and Kashmir 
with the former chief minister, Dr. Farooq Abdullah, returning 
to the state after a stay in the United Kingdom. On his arrival 
in Jammu today, Dr. Abdullah held detailed discussions with 
senior party colleagues and reviewed the political situation. 
Talking to newsmen, Dr. Abdullah said that he will reactivate 
the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference in the state. He said 
New Delhi has succeeded in exporting to the international 
community Pakistan's role in aiding and abetting terrorism in 
the state. Dr. Abdullah, however, said a lot still needs to be 
done to fail Pakistan's designs on Kashmir.

  [Text] On the occasion of God's day of 19 Dey, the 
anniversary of the bloody uprising staged by the people of Qom, 
which marked the start of the Islamic revolution, a large group 
of students and clergy from Qom seminary and various strata of 
the people from this city, met this evening with the leader of 
the Islamic revolution Ayatollah Khamene'i. 
  In the course of this meeting, the esteemed leader offered 
congratulations to the world Muslims and the proud nation of 
Iran on the eve of mission of the last of the prophets, Muhammad 
son of 'Abdallah, may God's peace and salutations be upon him 
and his scion. 
  His eminence referred to events of 19 Dey 1356 [9 January 
1978] as the beginning of a great development, which led to the 
destruction of the monarchy in Iran, shook America and the 
reactionary regimes, and established an Islamic government. 
  Ayatollah Khamene'i described each event of the Islamic 
revolution's 15-year history as a great lesson for the Muslim 
nation of Iran and said: The independent and liberated Iranian 
nation is fully aware and is armed with ample valuable 
experience gained during the war and the life of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran; thanks to this experience, no power and no 
government would dare enter the arena of a military conflict 
against the iron-clenched fist of our nation. 
  The leader of the Islamic revolution drew attention of the 
Iranian nation to the conspiracy hatched by the enemies of Islam 
to create discord, to undermine the people's solidarity and 
unity, and to promote suspicion among the people vis-a-vis the 
state authorities and the Islamic regime, and added: Today any 
speech or written words, and any move, which might create doubt 
among the Iranian nation about its last proud 15 years, the era 
of his eminence Imam [Khomeyni] -- may God be satisfied with his 
deeds -- about the performance of the authorities, and about the 
stances and the course of the revolution, would serve the 
particular interests of the enemy. Every individual must 
vigilantly watch for the enemy's conspiracies and enticements. 
  Referring to the pressure exerted on the European 
governments 
by America to win their support in the confrontation against 
Iran, the esteemed leader said: As the ringleader of arrogance, 
America has pleaded with the European governments to refrain 
from commercial transactions with Iran and from the sale of 
commodities, which the Iranian nation needs to rebuild the 
country, but the big European governments, which enjoy common 
sense and realize the importance of Iran and its regime, have 
rejected U.S. demands and ignored its enticement. 
  Referring to the claim that the faith, the sincere 
sentiments, and the revolutionary fervor of the Iranian nation 
have subsided, Ayatollah Khamene'i termed the claim as a vague 
imagination and added: The Iranian nation is a revolutionary 
nation and will never sever its ties with the revolution. Thanks 
to divine assistance, this revolution will bring such prosperity 
to this nation's life and after-life, that it will become an 
example to other nations. However, the realization of this 
important matter requires our endeavor, patience, cooperation, 
solidarity, sympathy, and our ability to recognize the enemy. 
  Ayatollah Khamene'i described the magnification of Iran's 
internal difficulties as a propaganda ploy employed by the enemy 
with the objective of creating despondency and despair among the 
people. 
  In conclusion, stressing the need for confronting the 
enemy's 
enticement of doom and gloom, Ayatollah Khamene'i called upon 
every level of the people to perform their duties properly and 
sincerely in whatever job they are doing.

  [Text] Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic 
arrived in Islamabad this morning on a three-day visit to 
Pakistan. Talking to newsmen at the airport, Silajdzic 
criticized the international community for failing to play an 
effective role in ending the Serb and Croat aggression against 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. He urged the international community to 
either act effectively to defend the Bosnian Muslims or allow 
them to defend themselves. He also called for an end to the 
arms embargo against Bosnia, which he described as illegal. He 
said the arms embargo against his country has caused the 
massacre of 200,000 Muslims. Silajdzic said renewed shelling 
and bombing by the Serb and Croat forces of Sarajevo and other 
cities has seriously hurt the process of restoring peace in 
Bosnia. He said Bosnia-Herzegovina is trying to restore peace, 
but the siege of Sarajevo is hampering this process. 
  Silajdzic praised Pakistan's role in the Bosnian crisis and 
its continued support for the Muslim people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  During his stay in Pakistan, Silajdzic will call on 
President 
Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari and meet with Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto.

  [Text] Baghdad, 7 Jan (MENA)--Iraqi officials have stated 
that Iraq has adopted a clear and frank stand on Arab 
reconciliation based on the need to reach a common Arab formula 
that would achieve better joint Arab action and guarantee 
inseparable and comprehensive pan-Arab security. The officials 
believe that such joint action should prevent any foreign 
aggression against any Arab country and that it should guarantee 
nonintervention in these countries' internal affairs, amend the 
Arab League charter, and set up an Arab court of justice to 
settle inter-Arab disputes without foreign intervention. 
  In statements to the MENA correspondent in Baghdad, a number 
of these officials expressed Iraq's interest in and support for 
joint Arab action in light of the great challenges facing the 
Arab nation. They also expressed Iraq's genuine desire to settle 
inter-Arab disputes because, as they put it, this "will help 
lift the blockade against Iraq." 
  Ambassador Nabil Najm, Iraq's permanent delegate to the Arab 
League, said his country has presented its opinions of Arab 
League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid's paper on 
Arab reconciliation. He said that, in this way, Iraq has proved 
its desire for interaction and allowing the opportunity for 
dialogue and an exchange of views to improve the situation. 
  The Iraqi delegate added: Many of those who talk about Arab 
reconciliation consider the so-called Gulf crisis to be the 
primary challenge the Arab nation has faced. They believe that 
this crisis caused the current situation, while Iraq thinks that 
perhaps the Gulf crisis was the result or one of the results of 
the bad situation that had existed before. 
  Ambassador Najm said Iraq believes that anyone who 
contemplates reconciliation must overlook past conflicts and 
establish a new groundwork that would enable us to bring about 
the desired Arab situation. 
  He said that his country is ready to positively and 
constructively discuss all issues pertaining to Arab 
reconciliation if there is a serious dialogue to achieve 
reconciliation on a new, sound basis. He noted that there are 
many challenges facing the Arab nation and that the 
reconciliation process should not ignore these challenges, 
particularly the cultural invasion, the growing military power 
of the Arab countries' neighbors, the water shortage, and Israel. 
  The Iraqi delegate spoke about the Kuwaiti prisoners 
issue--a 
result of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait that many consider the 
primary cause of Arab nation's division. He said: Iraq does not 
hold prisoners, but there are cases of people who have been 
missing since the war. Baghdad already agreed to receive Arab 
League envoys on the issue and is about to receive another envoy 
to ensure that all the prisoners have been released. 
  In a statement to MENA's correspondent in Baghdad, Iraqi 
National Assembly Speaker Sa'di Mahdi Salih affirmed his 
country's willingness and sincere desire to work for Arab 
reconciliation. He added: We hope there will be a distinction 
between what are called the Kuwaiti prisoners and the issue of 
the missing people because Iraq does not have any Kuwaiti 
prisoners. Perhaps there are missing people. 
  He said that Baghdad will welcome any Arab League envoy who 
wants to investigate the Kuwaiti prisoners issue.

  [Text] Ankara -- Shortly before two meetings that would be 
crucial on the question of Iraq -- a tripartite meeting between 
Turkish, Iranian and Syrian foreign ministers and a Turco-Iraqi 
meeting possibly at FM [Foreign Ministry] undersecretary level 
-- Iraqi Turkmans said any discussion on the issue should also 
take them into consideration. 
  Iraqi National Turkman Party leader Muzafer Arslan, who held 
a press conference Tuesday, said an "autonomous region for the 
Kurds of northern Iraq" was not acceptable. "If such a right is 
given to Kurds, it should also be given to Turkmans," he said. 
Responding to press allegations that "the establishment of an 
internationally guaranteed Kurdish autonomous region was under 
consideration," Arslan signalled his opposition, saying: "We do 
not support any solution that is for the Kurds alone. If 
autonomy is to be given to Kurds, it should also be given to 
Turkmans. If a federation is to be established for Kurds, why 
not for the Turkmans? The autonomous system has been practised 
in Iran before -- it did not work. Why should it be tried 
again?" 
  Emphasizing that his party's goal was "to ensure that the 
Turkmans should benefit from the same rights as the Kurds," 
Arslan said he would stress this once more to Turkish Foreign 
Ministry officials before the tripartite summit. 
  "All interested parties, from Turkey to Iraq's neighbors and 
to Western powers, including the United States, support the 
territorial integrity of Iraq," Arslan said. 
  Asked about the upcoming Turco-Iraqi meeting, which is 
expected to take place shortly as the "highest level meeting 
between the foreign ministries of the two countries," Arslan 
said: 
  "Turkey is a sovereign state and can choose to hold a 
meeting 
with any country it likes. But what is important is that the 
rights of the Turkmans should be discussed. The Foreign 
Ministry officials, with whom we are in constant touch, say they 
are doing just that. But we have heard no declaration to that 
effect." 
  Arslan suggested that observers, under the U.N. supervision 
and with the contribution of Turkey, should be placed in the 
Turkman zones. 
  "We are subjected to the inhuman treatment of the Iraqi 
government," Arslan said. "Iraqi soldiers enter Turkman homes. 
Eight Turkmans were recently executed in Karkuk three weeks ago." 
<H5>  Embargo Should Be Lifted </H5>
  Arslan said the embargo should be lifted as Turkmans were 
the 
ones who most suffered as a result of it. 
  "It is clear that the embargo has not been particularly 
successful in weakening the Saddam regime," he noted. "We have 
continuously pushed for the lifting of the embargo, but it is 
not up to us. So all we say is the humanitarian needs of the 
people should be met." 
  Despite various allegations that the aid sent to northern 
Iraq did not benefit the Iraqi Turkmans, Arslan maintained that 
this was not the case. 
  "There is a Turkman in the aid delivery teams. The aid is 
not enough, but it reaches us," he said. 
  Ankara has allocated 13.5 million dollars worth of 
humanitarian aid to northern Iraq.

  [Text] Ankara--Turkman TV, which will be broadcast by a 
satellite dish given by the Turkish Radio and Television 
Corporation (TRT), will soon air its first programs, Iraqi 
National Turkman Party (INTP) leader said. 
  INTP Chairman Muzaffer Arslan said Tuesday the system would 
be established around Irbil within 15 days, followed probably by 
Karkuk and Kifri. 
  He said that various arrangements had been made with certain 
private TV channels in order to obtain some program packages. 
"We have also arranged our dish to pick up the broadcasts of 
the International Turkish Channel, Avrasya," Arslan said. He 
added that various groups were "disturbed" by the "activities of 
the Turkmans." 
  When asked who these were, Arslan said, "Our relations with 
the Baghdad government have not been good. Nor are we on good 
terms with its extension in northern Iraq. Moreover, some 
Kurdish groups in northern Iraq are disturbed, because we keep 
our distance from them." 
  Arslan noted that a radio station in Turkish, called Voice 
of 
the Turkmans, had become the most popular in the region. 

<H5>    Training for Teachers </H5>
  INTP has also established two schools in northern Iraq, 
Karaoglan Primary School in Kifri and Dogus Primary School in 
Irbil. 
  "But we are in deep need of teachers and we have held talks 
with the Turkish Ministry of Education to provide schools," he

  [Text] Kuwait, 9 Jan -- British Secretary of Defense 
Malcolm Rifkind arrived here this afternoon on a visit to 
Kuwait. He was met by the defense minister, Shaykh 'Ali 
al-Sabah al-Salim. 
  In a statement to the Kuwait News Agency after his arrival, 
Rifkind said that this was his second visit to the Kuwait as 
defense secretary and that he had previously met Shaykh 'Ali 
al-Sabah al-Salim in Britain. 
  Rifkind added that the United Kingdom assessed its relations 
with the State of Kuwait highly and that it appreciated the way 
it had been able to reconstruct the country since its liberation 
from the Iraqi aggression by the international coalition forces. 
  Rifkind added: In a region which is still very volatile, and 
where there is a lot of uncertainty and a great possibility for 
aggression by the Iraqi regime, it is important that the 
countries of the region and the United Kingdom should stand 
firmly together. He said: We have some good arrangements with 
Kuwait, which announced some time ago that it was interested in 
buying Warrior armored troop carriers from the United Kingdom, 
and we have welcomed that. 
  He added: There is a lot of interest by the Sultanate of 
Oman 
and Bahrain to establish close cooperation with us. We are also 
cooperating with Kuwait in the military field. This includes 
joint exercises, and a large number of Kuwaiti military 
personnel are receiving training in the United Kingdom. 
  The British minister went on to say: We believe that it is 
imperative that Iraq should release all the prisoners. We know 
that Kuwait is concerned about their fate and we share that 
concern. 
  He said: It is important to inform the Iraqi regime of the 
need to comply with all UN demands if it wishes to join the 
world community on an equal basis again. 
  Rifkind concluded that the issue of prisoners was of 
paramount importance not only to Kuwait but to all those 
concerned on humanitarian grounds, and to those who were 
interested in the fate of any citizen held in Iraq. 
  It is to be noted that the British defense secretary is on a 
tour in the Gulf region that has included Oman and Bahrain in 
addition to Kuwait. He will leave tomorrow for the Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia at the end of his current tour.

  [Excerpts] French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has 
stressed that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia constitutes an element 
of stability, equilibrium, and security, and it is regarded as a 
key factor for strengthening stability in the region. He said 
this in a statement opening the news conference he held in 
Riyadh today at the conclusion of his visit to the Kingdom. 
[passage omitted]. The prime minister further said: We have 
agreed on coordination, consultation, and dialogue at all levels 
between state bodies as well as between companies, with a 
periodic exchange of views in order to assess bilateral 
relations and bolster the ties of cooperation in all fields, and 
to give fresh momentum to economic and trade cooperation. 
  The French prime minister mentioned the domains of 
cooperation that had been discussed, such as energy and defense, 
and he said: We have decided to set up a team of experts to 
complete the projects for cooperation which have already been 
discussed, examined, and prepared in detail, and which we want 
to start carrying out. [passage omitted] 
  Naturally, the French prime minister said, we discussed the 
situation in the region and recent events there, and we 
reaffirmed the need for the full implementation of the UN 
resolutions. Concerning the problems of the region at large, he 
said, we both stressed our full support for a just and 
comprehensive solution to the Middle East problem on the basis 
of the Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425. [passage 
omitted]. 
  The prime minister affirmed that his visit was aimed at 
giving a fresh impetus to relations between the two countries, 
and at laying down the principles that will clearly govern these 
relations. He denied that his visit was to conclude precise and 
defined contracts. He told journalists that France and the 
Kingdom had decided to set up a working team to discuss a number 
of projects of cooperation in the two friendly countries, 
complete what has been achieved, and secure progress in these 
matters. [passage omitted]. 
  For his part, and to a question on the problem of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who 
took part in the news conference, pointed out that he had 
discussed this matter with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Sa'ud 
al-Faysal, and he had the chance to explain the French and 
European diplomacy on this matter. He said: I believe that I 
have given a useful and detailed explanation to Prince Sa'ud 
al-Faysal that permits the strengthening of common understanding 
aimed at a peaceful settlement of this issue. He expressed his 
regret at the appalling deterioration of the situation, and he 
blamed all the parties to the conflict for rejecting the peace 
plans. [passage omitted] 
  On the other hand, with regard to the problem of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and what he learned in the Kingdom concerning 
the Saudi position in this respect, the French prime minister 
expressed understanding for the concern of Saudi Arabia toward 
this part of the world. He said that at the talks, he had tried 
to explain the French position and that of the European Union 
with a view to breaking the vicious circle surrounding the 
problem. [passage omitted]
